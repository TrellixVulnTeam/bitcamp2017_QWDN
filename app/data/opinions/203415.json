We address in this case whether\n\nappellee Alexandre Aronov is entitled to attorney's fees from the\n\ngovernment under the Equal Access to Justice Act (\"EAJA\"), 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2412.     The act provides that a court shall award fees and\n\nexpenses to a prevailing party in a civil action against the United\n\nStates unless the court finds that the position of the government\n\nwas substantially justified or that other circumstances make an\n\naward unjust.\n\n           Aronov    filed    the       action      in     this   case   to    force   the\n\ngovernment   to     act      on        his     long-pending          application       for\n\nnaturalization.     The district court awarded him attorney's fees\n\nunder the EAJA on the grounds that he was the prevailing party in\n\nthe litigation and that the pre-litigation position taken by the\n\ngovernment was not substantially justified. We affirm the district\n\ncourt's award.\n\n                                             I.\n\n           A native of Russia and a permanent resident of the United\n\nStates since 2001, Aronov applied for naturalization with the\n\nVermont   Service   Center        of    the       United    States    Citizenship      and\n\nImmigration Services (\"USCIS\") on May 22, 2004.                          After initial\n\nprocessing   and    completion         of    the    required      fingerprint     check,\n\nAronov's case was forward to the Boston USCIS office.                         Pursuant to\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1446(b) and 8 C.F.R. § 335.2(a), Aronov was interviewed\n\non February 14, 2005 regarding his application.                       However, as the\n\n\n                                             -2-\n\fgovernment acknowledges, the agency's interview with Aronov was\n\npremature.    The agency's own regulation dictates that an initial\n\nexamination should be undertaken only after an applicant's full\n\nbackground check has been completed. See 8 C.F.R. § 335.2(b) (\"The\n\nService will notify applicants for naturalization to appear before\n\na Service officer for initial examination on the naturalization\n\napplication only after the Service has received a definitive\n\nresponse from the Federal Bureau of Investigation that a full\n\ncriminal background check of an applicant has been completed.\").\n\nThe   government    has   not    explained    why   it   did   not   follow   its\n\nregulation in this case.\n\n           At the time of the interview, Aronov was informed that\n\nhis application could not be approved until additional security\n\nchecks were completed.          After hearing nothing from the USCIS for\n\nmore than a year, Aronov received a letter from the agency on March\n\n23, 2006 informing him that his application was being actively\n\nprocessed, but that additional review was required.                  The notice\n\nalso instructed Aronov to contact USCIS if he did not receive a\n\ndecision within six months of the date of the notice.\n\n           On August 28, 2006, more than eighteen months after being\n\ninterviewed by the agency, Aronov filed an action in the district\n\ncourt under 8 U.S.C. § 1447(b), requesting that the court grant his\n\napplication   for    naturalization     or,    alternatively,        remand   his\n\n\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fapplication with instructions to the agency to adjudicate it.1\n\nFive weeks later, on October 6, the government and Aronov filed a\n\nJoint Motion for Remand Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1447(b).      In full,\n\nthe joint motion read:\n\n                   Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1447(b), the\n            parties in this action, plaintiff . . . and\n            defendants Michael Chertoff, Secretary of the\n            United States Department of Homeland Security,\n            et al., hereby jointly move this Honorable\n            Court to remand this matter to the USCIS, so\n            that [it] can grant plaintiff's application\n            for naturalization, and schedule plaintiff's\n            oath ceremony for no later than November 8,\n            2006. In support of this motion, the parties\n            state as follows:\n\n                   1.   On or about August 28, 2006,\n            plaintiff Alexandre Aronov filed this action.\n                   2.   Since   that   date,   USCIS   has\n            completed    its   review    of    plaintiff's\n            application   for   naturalization   and,   if\n            jurisdiction is returned to the agency, would\n            grant the application and schedule plaintiff's\n            oath ceremony for no later than November 8,\n            2006.\n                   3.   The governing statute, 8 U.S.C. §\n            1447(b), provides that, in cases in which the\n            agency has failed to render a decision on an\n\n\n     1\n         8 U.S.C. § 1447(b) reads:\n\n            If there is a failure to make a determination\n            under section 1446 of this title [to grant or\n            deny the naturalization application] before\n            the end of the 120-day period after the date\n            on which the examination is conducted . . . ,\n            the applicant may apply to the United States\n            district court for the district in which the\n            applicant resides for a hearing on the matter.\n            Such court has jurisdiction over the matter\n            and may either determine the matter or remand\n            the matter, with appropriate instructions, to\n            the [USCIS] to determine the matter.\n\n                                 -4-\n\f            application for naturalization within 120 days\n            of the examination of the applicant, the\n            applicant may file suit in district court\n            requesting to adjudicate the application and\n            \"[s]uch court has jurisdiction over the matter\n            and may either determine the matter or remand\n            the matter, with appropriate instructions, to\n            the Service to determine the matter.\"\n\n                   Wherefore, with good cause having been\n            shown, the parties respectfully request that\n            this Court remand this matter to USCIS so that\n            it can grant plaintiff's application for\n            naturalization and schedule plaintiff for an\n            oath ceremony for no later than November 8,\n            2006.\n\n            On October 12, 2006, the court entered an electronic\n\norder granting the motion and the remand.    The docket text for the\n\nremand order states: \"Judge Nancy Gertner: Electronic ORDER entered\n\ngranting 3 Joint Motion to Remand to US Citizenship and Immigration\n\nServices.\"2   Aronov was sworn in as a U.S. citizen on November 8,\n\n2006.\n\n            On November 28, 2006, Aronov filed an application for\n\nattorney's fees pursuant to the EAJA.    The statute provides:\n\n            Except as otherwise specifically provided by\n            statute, a court shall award to a prevailing\n            party other than the United States fees and\n            other expenses, in addition to any costs\n            awarded pursuant to subsection (a), incurred\n            by that party in any civil action (other than\n            cases sounding in tort), including proceedings\n            for judicial review of agency action, brought\n            by or against the United States in any court\n            having jurisdiction of that action, unless the\n            court finds that the position of the United\n\n\n        2\n       The \"3\" references the previously submitted joint remand\nmotion.\n\n                                 -5-\n\f          States was substantially justified or that\n          special circumstances make an award unjust.\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A). The government opposed the application,\n\nasserting that Aronov was not a prevailing party in the litigation\n\nunder the test established in Buckhannon Board and Care Home, Inc.\n\nv. West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources, 532 U.S.\n\n598 (2001), and that the government's position regarding his\n\napplication was substantially justified. The district court agreed\n\nwith Aronov and ordered the government to pay him $4,270.94 in\n\nattorney's fees and costs.   The government appeals this decision.\n\n                                 II.\n\n          Although parties are ordinarily required, win or lose, to\n\nbear their own attorney's fees, see, e.g., Alyeska Pipeline Serv.\n\nCo. v. Wilderness Soc'y, 421 U.S. 240, 247 (1975), a number of\n\nexceptions to this default rule have been adopted by statute.           One\n\nsuch exception, the EAJA, authorizes the award of attorney's fees\n\nand costs to a litigant who has brought a civil suit against the\n\nUnited States if (1) she is the prevailing party in the matter; (2)\n\nthe government fails to show that its position was substantially\n\njustified; and (3) no special circumstances would make such an\n\naward unjust. 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A); see also Schock v. United\n\nStates, 254 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2001).           By offering qualifying\n\nlitigants attorney's fees and other expenses, the EAJA seeks \"to\n\nremove   economic   deterrents   to    parties    who   seek   review   of\n\nunreasonable government action.\"      Schock, 254 F.3d at 4.\n\n                                 -6-\n\f          We review the district court's decision to grant or deny\n\na fee application under the EAJA for abuse of discretion, id.,\n\n\"mindful that the district court has an 'intimate knowledge of the\n\nnuances of the underlying case,'\"     New England Regional Council of\n\nCarpenters v. Kinton, 284 F.3d 9, 30 (1st Cir. 2002) (quoting Gay\n\nOfficers Action League v. Puerto Rico, 247 F.3d 288, 292 (1st Cir.\n\n2001)).   \"Such deference is particularly appropriate where, as\n\nhere, the correctness of the court's decision depends in large part\n\non the proper characterization of its own statements.\"       Id.   We\n\napply this standard to both the prevailing party and substantial\n\njustification determinations.   Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U.S. 552,\n\n558-63 (1988) (substantial justification); McDonald v. Secretary of\n\nHHS, 884 F.2d 1468 (1st Cir. 1989) (prevailing party).    An error of\n\nlaw is always an abuse of discretion.       Rosario-Urdaz v. Rivera-\n\nHernandez, 350 F.3d 219, 221 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\nA. Prevailing Party\n\n          1.   The District Court's Decision\n\n          The district court began its attorney's fees analysis by\n\naddressing whether Aronov was a prevailing party under the EAJA.\n\nInvoking the Supreme Court's decision in Buckhannon, the district\n\ncourt found that the first requirement of the prevailing party\n\nstandard -- whether there was \"a material alteration of the legal\n\nrelationship of the parties\" -- was indisputably met because\n\nAronov's status had changed from legal permanent resident to U.S.\n\n\n                                -7-\n\fcitizen. The government does not dispute that this requirement has\n\nbeen satisfied.\n\n          Proceeding to the second element of the test -- whether\n\nthere was a \"judicial imprimatur3 on the change\" in status -- the\n\ncourt rejected the government's assertion that the imprimatur\n\nrequirement had not been met here because the agency had acted\n\nvoluntarily to grant Aronov's naturalization application. Instead,\n\nthe court concluded that the remand order satisfied the second\n\nelement set forth in Buckhannon because the order effectuated the\n\nchange in legal status that Aronov had sought. The court indicated\n\nthat the remand did not merely return jurisdiction to USCIS.           It\n\nalso mandated the agency's compliance with a November 8, 2006\n\ndeadline for granting Aronov's naturalization.           The court noted\n\nthat \"[w]here the government in Buckhannon took its conciliatory\n\naction purely voluntarily, and took on no further duties in the\n\ndismissal, the government here was granted not a dismissal, but a\n\nremand to the agency conditional on the granting of plaintiff's\n\nnaturalization    action   by   November   8,   2006.\"     (emphasis   in\n\noriginal).   It asserted, therefore, that \"[h]ad the naturalization\n\nnot so occurred, the parties might very well be back in front of\n\nthis court litigating a contempt action.        This is far more than a\n\ncatalyst theory -- it was an order of the Court.\"\n\n\n\n     3\n       Black's Law Dictionary defines \"imprimatur\" as \"a grant of\napproval; commendatory license or sanction.\" (8th ed. 2004).\n\n                                   -8-\n\f            2.    Buckhannon\n\n            The issue in Buckhannon was whether a legislative change\n\nthat effectively awarded petitioner its sought-after relief could\n\nprovide the basis for a statutory fee award.4           The plaintiff was an\n\noperator    of   assisted     living   homes   who   failed     a   state   fire\n\ninspection because some of the residents of plaintiff's homes were\n\nnot capable of \"self-preservation,\" as defined by West Virginia\n\nlaw. On behalf of itself and other parties similarly situated, the\n\nhome operator brought suit against the state, two state agencies,\n\nand several individuals, seeking injunctive and declaratory relief\n\nto the effect that the \"self-preservation\" requirement violated\n\nprovisions of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (\"FHAA\") and\n\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\"ADA\").                Before the\n\nfederal    district   court    decided   the   issue,    the    West   Virginia\n\nlegislature      eliminated    the   \"self-preservation\"       requirement   by\n\nstatute.    The court subsequently granted the defendants' motion to\n\ndismiss the case.\n\n\n\n     4\n       Although the Supreme Court in Buckhannon interpreted the\nfee-shifting provisions of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988\n(\"FHAA\"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601-3631, and the Americans with\nDisabilities Act of 1990 (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213, \"the\nprinciples underlying [its] holding [we]re broadly stated and []\nnot statute-specific.\" Doe v. Boston Pub. Schs., 358 F.3d 20, 25\n(1st Cir. 2004).    Accordingly, we have held that the Supreme\nCourt's reasoning in \"Buckhannon is presumed to apply generally to\nall fee-shifting statutes that use the 'prevailing party'\nterminology.\" Smith v. Fitchburg Pub. Schs., 401 F.3d 16, 22 n.8\n(1st Cir. 2005) (quoting Doe, 358 F.3d at 25). The parties do not\ndispute the applicability of Buckhannon in this case.\n\n                                       -9-\n\f            The plaintiffs filed an application for attorney's fees\n\nunder the FHAA and the ADA, which was denied by both the district\n\ncourt and the Fourth Circuit.        The Supreme Court affirmed.       The\n\nCourt held that petitioner could not obtain a fee award in the\n\nmatter because the legal change had not been judicially sanctioned\n\nby a court.   Buckhannon, 532 U.S. at 605 (\"[D]efendant's voluntary\n\nchange   in   conduct,   although    perhaps   accomplishing    what   the\n\nplaintiff sought to achieve by the lawsuit, lack[ed] the necessary\n\njudicial imprimatur.\").     The Court explicitly rejected the notion\n\nthat a party is entitled to attorney's fees simply because the\n\nunderlying litigation triggered her sought-after relief -- the so-\n\ncalled \"catalyst theory.\"     Id.     It noted that previously it had\n\n\"only awarded attorney's fees where the plaintiff ha[d] received a\n\njudgment on the merits or obtained a court-ordered consent decree,\"\n\nbut not \"where the plaintiff ha[d] secured the reversal of a\n\ndirected verdict, or acquired a judicial pronouncement that the\n\ndefendant ha[d] violated the Constitution unaccompanied by judicial\n\nrelief,\" id. at 605-06 (internal citation and quotation marks\n\nomitted). A private settlement not incorporated into a court order\n\ndoes not confer prevailing party status.        See id. at 606 (\"Never\n\nhave we awarded attorney's fees for a nonjudicial alteration of\n\nactual   circumstances.\")   (emphasis      added)   (internal   quotation\n\nomitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\f            3.    Smith v. Fitchburg Public Schools\n\n            As a circuit, we have applied Buckhannon in a number of\n\ncases, see Smith v. Fitchburg Public Schools, 401 F.3d 16, 22 (1st\n\nCir. 2005) (applying the Supreme Court's decision in the context of\n\nan action under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act\n\n(\"IDEA\")); Doe v. Boston Public Schools, 358 F.3d 20, 22-26 (1st\n\nCir. 2004) (similar analysis); Kinton, 284 F.3d at 30 (declining to\n\naward attorney's fees because the district court had not entered\n\nany order \"compelling, or even leading to\" the plaintiff receiving\n\nthe relief it had requested), each time evaluating the specific\n\nfacts of the case to determine whether the court's conduct was\n\nsufficient to \"provide the necessary judicial imprimatur on the\n\nchange in the legal relationship between the parties,\" Smith, 401\n\nF.3d at 23 (citation omitted).\n\n            The    government   relies    in   particular   on   our   Smith\n\ndecision.    There, the parents of a disabled child initiated a\n\nproceeding under the IDEA against the Fitchburg Public Schools,\n\nseeking special education services for their child.          After several\n\npre-hearing orders by a hearing officer of the Bureau of Special\n\nEducation Appeals (\"BSEA\"), the entity in charge of overseeing the\n\nproceeding, the parties reached a private settlement that provided\n\nthe plaintiffs all of the relief they had sought.           The plaintiffs\n\nsubsequently filed an action in the district court seeking to\n\nrecover attorney's fees pursuant to the IDEA. They argued that the\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\forders of the BSEA, which required the school district to take\n\ncertain actions and set deadlines for those actions, served as the\n\nnecessary \"judicial imprimatur\" to grant them \"prevailing party\"\n\nstatus.          Id. at 22.\n\n                  After recognizing that the administrative relief was not\n\nin the form of a consent decree or a final judgment on the merits,\n\nand that the plaintiffs had not argued that the administrative\n\norders      were     functionally    equivalent     to    a    consent     decree,   we\n\naddressed in Smith whether the facts of the case generally met the\n\ntwo required elements of Buckhannon.5                    Acknowledging that the\n\nplaintiffs          had   achieved   a   material    change      in   the    parties'\n\nrelationship -- thereby satisfying the first prong of Buckhannon,\n\nwe rejected the plaintiffs' claim for attorney's fees on the ground\n\nthat       the    BSEA    orders   had   not   provided       sufficient    \"judicial\n\nimprimatur\" on the relief obtained.              Id. at 27.       On this issue, we\n\nobserved that when the administrative orders were imposed, the BSEA\n\nhad not yet begun to analyze the plaintiffs' substantive claim --\n\nwhether they were entitled to relief pursuant to the IDEA --\n\nbecause it had yet to convene a due process hearing.                  Id. at 26-27.\n\nThe BSEA's decisions, therefore, were not substantive ones made\n\n\n       5\n       We noted in Smith that this circuit had not \"squarely\naddressed whether judgments on the merits or consent decrees are\nthe only forms of relief sufficient to confer prevailing party\nstatus, whether a functional equivalent of such relief may be\nadequate, or whether any other types of relief could satisfy\nBuckhannon's requirements.\" Smith, 401 F.3d at 23; see also Doe,\n358 F.3d at 24 n.4.\n\n                                          -12-\n\fafter reviewing the merits of plaintiffs' claims, but rather orders\n\ndirecting   Fitchburg   to   do   what    it    had   already    promised        the\n\nplaintiffs it would do.      Id. at 27.        Accordingly, the \"orders and\n\nruling were [not] issued . . . to place the weight of judicial\n\nauthority    behind     Fitchburg's      substantive          concession        that\n\n[plaintiff] was entitled to an IEP,\" and hence the relief obtained\n\nby the plaintiffs lacked the necessary judicial imprimatur.                 Id.\n\n            4.   Applying Buckhannon and Smith\n\n            Citing Smith, the government contends that the district\n\ncourt's remand order did not provide the necessary \"judicial\n\nimprimatur\" for Aronov's sought-after remedy, naturalization.                    The\n\ngovernment maintains that it already had voluntarily decided to\n\ngrant Aronov's application.       It then established a specific time-\n\nframe for doing so, and the court order merely \"memorialized\" the\n\ngovernment's independent concessions, as it did in Smith. Further,\n\nthe remand order did not include any \"appropriate instructions\"\n\ndirecting the government to take specific action, see 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1447(b), or retain jurisdiction in order to determine whether the\n\ngovernment followed through on its voluntary decision to approve\n\nAronov's application.       Accordingly, the order had no substantive\n\neffect on the proceeding and, therefore, did not constitute a\n\n\"judicial    imprimatur,\"    as   the    Supreme      Court    defined     it    in\n\nBuckhannon and as we applied the standard in Smith.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\f           We    reject     the       government's    arguments   and    find    its\n\nreliance on Smith misplaced.               Most of the language from Smith\n\nrelied upon by the government comes in that portion of the panel's\n\ndecision where it assesses whether the plaintiff's relief, \"even\n\nthough not in the form of a consent decree or a final judgment on\n\nthe   merits,        comports    with     the    overarching    requirements         of\n\nBuckhannon; that is, whether the [administrative hearing officer's\n\ninvolvement]     provided       the    necessary     judicial   imprimatur      on    a\n\nmaterial alteration of the legal relationship between the parties.\"\n\nSmith, 401 F.3d at 26.           As the panel noted, \"[the plaintiff] does\n\nnot argue that the order dismissing her case is the functional\n\nequivalent of a consent decree, and thus we deem that argument\n\nwaived.\"     Id. at 24.         Moreover, the Smith panel assessed whether\n\nthe order of an administrative hearing officer, rather than the\n\norder of a judge, meets the prevailing party standard set forth in\n\nBuckhannon.      Since the administrative law analog to a judicial\n\nconsent decree is uncertain, the focus of the panel in Smith was\n\nwhether the administrative orders were akin to a judgment on the\n\nmerits.    In short, the Smith decision has little relevance to the\n\nprevailing party issue here, which turns on whether the district\n\ncourt's order was the functional equivalent of a consent decree.\n\n           Nevertheless, though offered as dicta, the Smith panel\n\nmade some useful observations about the concept of the functional\n\nequivalent      of    a   consent      decree.       Specifically,      the   panel\n\n\n                                         -14-\n\fdistinguished between a court's incorporation of the terms of an\n\nagreement    between   the   parties,    which   made   the   court   order\n\nfunctionally equivalent to a consent decree, and mere recognition\n\nof an agreement accompanied by the dismissal of the case because\n\nthere is no longer a dispute, which was not equivalent to a consent\n\ndecree.     Relying on the Fourth Circuit's decision in Smyth v.\n\nRivero, the panel put that critical difference in these terms:\n\n            Thus, \"either incorporation of the terms of\n            the   agreement  or   a   separate   provision\n            retaining jurisdiction over the agreement will\n            suffice for [an order to be considered the\n            functional equivalent of a consent decree]\" .\n            . . In contrast, \"[w]here a court merely\n            recognizes the fact of the parties' agreement\n            and dismisses the case because there is no\n            longer a dispute before it, the terms of the\n            agreement are not made part of the order and\n            consequently will not serve as a basis of\n            jurisdiction.\"\n\nSmith, 401 F.3d at 24 (quoting Smyth, 282 F.3d 268, 283 (4th Cir.\n\n2002)).\n\n            Here, the district court held that its remand order fell\n\nunder the first category of orders -- where the court incorporates\n\nthe terms of the parties' agreement into an order -- rather than\n\nthe second -- where the court merely recognizes the agreement and\n\ndismisses the matter as no longer in dispute.            As the district\n\ncourt put it:\n\n            In    Buckhannon,   the    government    acted\n            independently to give the plaintiff what it\n            wanted, and then sought dismissal. Here, the\n            Court remanded specifically \"so that USCIS can\n            grant     plaintiff's     application      for\n\n                                  -15-\n\f          naturalization, and schedule plaintiff's oath\n          ceremony for no later than November 8, 2006.\"\n          This is the judicial imprimatur required by\n          and   lacking  in   the   specific   facts  of\n          Buckhannon.      Where   the   government   in\n          Buckhannon took its conciliatory action purely\n          voluntarily, and took on no further duties in\n          the dismissal, the government here was granted\n          not a dismissal, but a remand to the agency\n          conditional on the granting of plaintiff's\n          naturalization by November 8, 2006. Had the\n          naturalization not so occurred, the parties\n          might very well be back in front of this Court\n          litigating a contempt action.      This is far\n          more than a catalyst theory -- it was an order\n          of the Court.\n\nAronov v. Chertoff, No. 06-11526-NG, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40455,\n\nat *4-5 (Jan. 30, 2007) (emphasis in original).\n\n          Because the district court is in the best position to\n\nexplain the meaning of its own order, we defer to its conclusion on\n\nthe significance of the remand order.         See Kinton, 284 F.3d at 30\n\n(\"Clearly, the district court is in the best position to determine\n\nwhether its statements . . . should be considered as the functional\n\nequivalent of a judicial order within the meaning of Buckhannon.\");\n\nHarvey v. Johanns, 494 F.3d 237, 242 (1st Cir. 2007) (\"We must, of\n\ncourse, accord deference to the district court's interpretation of\n\nthe wording of its own order.\"); see also Lefkowitz v. Fair, 816\n\nF.2d 17, 22 (1st Cir. 1987) (\"[U]ncertainty as to the meaning and\n\nintendment   of   a   district   court    order   can   sometimes   best   be\n\ndispelled by deference to the views of the writing judge.\").\n\n          Moreover, based on our assessment of the remand order and\n\nthe circumstances of its issuance, we see no reason to question the\n\n                                   -16-\n\fdistrict court's assessment of its own work.                   After Aronov filed\n\nsuit       in   the   district    court    under       the   statute,   USCIS   lost\n\njurisdiction to adjudicate Aronov's application, thereby precluding\n\nit from entering a binding legal agreement with Aronov regarding\n\nhis application.         8 U.S.C. § 1447(b) (\"Such court has jurisdiction\n\nover the matter and may either determine the matter or remand the\n\nmatter, with appropriate instructions, to the [USCIS] to determine\n\nthe matter.\"); see Etape v. Chertoff, 497 F.3d 379, 384-85 (4th\n\nCir. 2007).6          The parties acknowledged as much in their joint\n\nmotion for remand to the district court, which highlights the terms\n\nof 8 U.S.C. § 1447(b).           Therefore, despite the agency's concession\n\nto allow Aronov's naturalization, it did not have the authority to\n\neffectuate        that   outcome     until       the   district   court    returned\n\njurisdiction to the agency. The court's order was indispensable to\n\nthe naturalization outcome.\n\n                The court's remand order also ended the dispute by\n\nproviding Aronov his sought-after relief. To be sure, the district\n\n\n       6\n       The question of whether the court maintains exclusive\njurisdiction or, alternatively, concurrent jurisdiction with the\nUSCIS has been litigated in other courts. Most courts have held\nthat the district court has exclusive jurisdiction over the\napplication until it has acted pursuant to the statute. See, e.g.,\nEtape, 497 F.3d at 384-85 (holding that § 1447(b) vests the\ndistrict court with exclusive jurisdiction over a naturalization\napplication); United States v. Hovsepian, 359 F.3d 1144, 1159 (9th\nCir. 2002) (en banc) (same).       But see, e.g., Bustamante v.\nChertoff, 533 F. Supp. 2d 373, 381 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) (reaching the\nopposite conclusion). Here, the government does not assert that\nthe USCIS maintained jurisdiction over Aronov's application after\nhe filed suit in district court.\n\n                                          -17-\n\fcourt relied on the government's statements in the joint motion for\n\nremand that naturalization was appropriate.          However, because of\n\nthe jurisdictional element, the district court could reasonably\n\nconclude that it was ultimately the remand order, not the agency's\n\nconcession, that brought about the material change in the parties'\n\nrelationship and \"place[d] the weight of judicial authority\" on the\n\nagreed-upon alteration in Aronov's legal status, see Smith, 401\n\nF.3d at 26.\n\n            There remains the question of the form of the court's\n\norder.     If the district court had entered an order explicitly\n\nsetting forth the agreement of the parties as set forth in the\n\njoint motion for remand, its order would unquestionably be a\n\nconsent decree.      See Frew v. Hawkins, 540 U.S 431, 437 (2004) (\"A\n\nconsent decree 'embodies an agreement of the parties' and is also\n\n'an agreement that the parties desire and expect will be reflected\n\nin, and be enforceable as, a judicial decree that is subject to the\n\nrules    generally   applicable   to   other   judgments   and   decrees.'\"\n\n(quoting Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502 U.S. 367, 378\n\n(1992))); see also Black's Law Dictionary (8th ed. 2004) (defining\n\na \"consent decree\" as \"[a] court decree that all parties agree\n\nto\").    Yet the district court's brief remand order here, which\n\nincorporated the terms of the joint motion by reference, had the\n\nsame import and effect.     See Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of\n\nAm., 511 U.S. 375, 381 (1994) (indicating that a court would\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\fmaintain jurisdiction to enforce a settlement agreement \"if the\n\nparties' obligation to comply with [its] terms . . . had been made\n\npart of the order of dismissal -- either by separate provision . .\n\n. or by incorporating the terms of the settlement agreement in the\n\norder.      In that event, a breach of the agreement would be a\n\nviolation of the order, and ancillary jurisdiction to enforce the\n\nagreement would therefore exist.\").         Hence the brief remand order\n\nwas   the   functional    equivalent   of   a   consent     decree.     If   the\n\ngovernment had failed to comply with the terms of the remand order,\n\nAronov    could   have   sought   enforcement    of   the   order     through   a\n\ncontempt proceeding, as the district court noted.               He would not\n\nhave had to file a separate contract action against the agency or\n\nanother suit under § 1447(b).7\n\n\n      7\n       This distinction has an analog in the private realm, where\none party is seeking to enforce the terms of a settlement agreement\nagainst another private party.     If the terms of the settlement\nagreement have not been incorporated into a court order, the\nfederal courts will often lack jurisdiction to enforce its terms.\nIn contrast, where the parties have obtained a consent decree or a\ncourt order that either incorporates the terms of the settlement\nagreement or explicitly retains jurisdiction, a federal court will\npossess \"enforcement\" or \"ancillary\" jurisdiction to enforce the\nterms of the order. See Kokkonen, 511 U.S. at 381; Buckhannon, 532\nU.S. at 604 n.7 (\"[F]ederal jurisdiction to enforce a private\ncontractual settlement will often be lacking unless the terms of\nthe agreement are incorporated into the order of dismissal.\")\n(emphasis added); see also Fafel v. DiPaola, 399 F.3d 403, 414\n(recognizing that a federal court had ancillary jurisdiction to\nenforce its prior Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 68 judgment because the\njudgment, although limited in nature, \"necessarily incorporate[d]\nthe terms of the underlying Rule 68 offer\" and the district court\nlimited its exercise of ancillary jurisdiction to enforcing the\nterms of that prior judgment); Martel v. Fridovich, 14 F.3d 1, 3\nn.4 (1st Cir. 1993) (per curiam) (\"The appropriate vehicle for\n\n                                    -19-\n\f          There is ample authority for the proposition that the\n\nfunctional   equivalent   of   a     consent   decree   satisfies   the\n\nrequirements of Buckhannon.8   Like our sister circuits, we do not\n\nread Buckhannon so narrowly as to preclude all forms of judicial\n\n\n\nenforcement of the consent decree is an action for contempt brought\nbefore the court responsible for the decree.\").\n     8\n       See, e.g., Truesdell v. Phila. Hous. Auth., 290 F.3d 159,\n165 (3d Cir. 2002) (holding that a court order, characterized by\nthe defendant as a stipulated settlement, was sufficient to support\na finding of judicial imprimatur where the order contained\nmandatory language, included the judge's signature, and was\njudicially enforceable); Smyth, 282 F.3d at 281 (\"We doubt that the\nSupreme Court's guidance in Buckhannon was intended to be\ninterpreted so restrictively as to require that the words 'consent\ndecree' be used explicitly.\"); T.D. v.

Chmielarz, 289 F.3d 1315, 1320 (11th Cir.\n2002) (\"A formal consent decree is unnecessary . . . because the\nexplicit retention of jurisdiction or the court's order\nspecifically approving the terms of the settlement are . . . the\nfunctional equivalent of the entry of a consent decree.\"); Davy v.\nCIA, 456 F.3d 162, 166 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (\"Where a settlement\nagreement is embodied in a court order such that the obligation to\ncomply with its terms is court-ordered, the court's approval and\nthe attendant judicial over-sight (in the form of continuing\njurisdiction to enforce the agreement) may be equally apparent. We\nwill assume, then, that an order containing an agreement reached by\nthe parties may be functionally a consent decree for purposes of\nthe inquiry to which Buckhannon directs us.\"); see also Bell v. Bd.\nof County Comm'rs. of Jefferson County, 451 F.3d 1097, 1103 (10th\nCir. 2006) (\"Most circuits recognize that some settlement\nagreements, even though not explicitly labeled as a consent decree\nmay confer prevailing party status, if they are sufficiently\nanalogous to a consent decree.\") (internal quotations omitted).\n\n                                   -20-\n\frelief other than a judgment on the merits or a court order in the\n\nform of a consent decree, or one explicitly labeled as such, from\n\nsatisfying the judicial imprimatur requirement.9             Therefore, the\n\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in holding that its\n\nremand order issued pursuant to § 1447(b) incorporated the terms of\n\nthe parties' joint motion and hence was the functional equivalent\n\nof   a        court-ordered   consent   decree.10   Accordingly,   the   order\n\nconstituted the necessary \"judicial imprimatur\" on the parties'\n\n\n\n         9\n       Although in Smith we noted that there was disagreement among\nour sister circuits on this question, citing the Eighth Circuit's\ndecision in Christina A. v. Bloomberg, 315 F.3d 990 (8th Cir.\n2003), as an example of a court reading Buckhannon narrowly to\npreclude all other forms of relief, the Eighth Circuit has more\nrecently repudiated our reading of its decision. See Smith, 401\nF.3d at 23. In Northern Cheyenne Tribe v. Jackson, 433 F.3d 1083,\n1085 n.2 (8th Cir. 2006), the court asserted that its decision in\nChristina A. did not foreclose the possibility that other types of\ncourt-ordered relief could provide the requisite judicial\nimprimatur required by Buckhannon.\n         10\n       The dissent asserts that the issue of whether the district\ncourt's remand order was the equivalent of a consent decree was not\nraised by either party, nor was it the theory on which the district\ncourt relied, and therefore we should not analyze that issue in\ndeciding the case.    The district court did not use the phrase\n\"functional equivalent of a consent decree\" in its decision\nawarding attorney's fees and costs to Aronov. Nevertheless, in\naddressing the judicial imprimatur question in its decision, the\ndistrict court described its order as incorporating the terms of\nthe parties' joint motion for remand. It further stated that its\norder could be enforced through a contempt action.       Hence the\ndistrict court described its order in consent-decree terms. The\ngovernment chose not to challenge this consent-decree aspect of the\ndistrict court's decision.       Instead, it advanced a largely\nirrelevant judicial imprimatur argument under our Smith decision\nthat it deemed more favorable to its position. Aronov responded to\nthe argument made by the government.      He had no obligation to\nrespond to an argument that the government did not make.\n\n                                        -21-\n\fchange in legal relationship, qualifying Aronov as a prevailing\n\nparty.\n\nB. Substantial Justification\n\n           1. Framework for Review\n\n           The government bears the burden of demonstrating that its\n\nposition was substantially justified.             Shock, 254 F.3d at 5.        The\n\nSupreme   Court      has   interpreted      the   \"substantially     justified\"\n\nlanguage in the EAJA to require reasonableness: \"[A]s between the\n\ntwo commonly used connotations of the word 'substantially,' the one\n\nmost naturally conveyed by the phrase before us here is not\n\n'justified to a high degree,' but rather 'justified in substance or\n\nin the main' -- that is, justified to a degree that could satisfy\n\na reasonable person.\"         Pierce, 487 U.S. at 565; see also, e.g.,\n\nShock, 254 F.3d at 5; Dantran, Inc. v. U.S. Dep't of Labor, 246\n\nF.3d 36, 40-41 (1st Cir. 2001).            Thus, the key question is whether\n\nthe government's position has \"a reasonable basis in law and fact.\"\n\nPierce, 487 U.S. at 566 n.2.\n\n           As   a    matter   of   law,     the   government's      position    is\n\nsubstantially justified when the government's actions are required\n\nby a statute or law.       See Dantran, 246 F.3d at 41; United States v.\n\nOne Parcel of Real Prop., 960 F.2d 200, 208-09 (1st Cir. 1992); see\n\nalso United States v. B & M Used Cars, 860 F.2d 121, 124 (4th Cir.\n\n1988) (\"Whether the government's decision . . . was reasonable must\n\nbe   examined   in    light   of   .   .    .   the   appropriate   statute.\").\n\n\n                                       -22-\n\fAdditionally,       the    government's       position      may   be   substantially\n\njustified even if its reasonable interpretation of its legal\n\nobligations is not ultimately affirmed by a court.                       Schock, 254\n\nF.3d   at    5.     The       district   court     having    concluded        that   the\n\ngovernment's litigation position was substantially justified, we\n\nreview only the government's pre-litigation position.                    28 U.S.C. §\n\n2412(d)(2)(D); Shock, 254 F.3d at 5.\n\n             2. The District Court's Decision\n\n             In focusing on the government's pre-litigation position,\n\nthe court noted that more than a year and a half had passed between\n\nAronov's citizenship exam and the filing of his action -- an amount\n\nof time that exceeded by a multiple of four the statutory period\n\nthat was a prerequisite for filing an action under 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1447(b).     The court viewed this delay as unjustified because the\n\ngovernment had procedures in place for expediting an FBI name check\n\napplication, including issuance of a writ of mandamus.                        The court\n\nconcluded that \"[i]t is not 'substantially justified' for the\n\ngovernment to force naturalization applicants to incur additional\n\nexpense     --    and   the     courts   to   be    burdened      --   just    to    have\n\nnaturalization applications processed in the timely manner already\n\nsupposedly guaranteed by statute.\"                 It rejected the government's\n\nargument that it was unable to act on Aronov's application sooner\n\nbecause     the   FBI     did   not   complete     its   background     check       until\n\nSeptember 2006.\n\n\n                                         -23-\n\f            3. The Government's Position\n\n            The government claims that two statutes justify its\n\nactions and inactions on Aronov's application.              First, it cites 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1446(a), which provides that \"[b]efore a person may be\n\nnaturalized, an employee of the [USCIS], or of the United States\n\ndesignated by the Attorney General, shall conduct a personal\n\ninvestigation of the person applying for naturalization.\"                     It\n\nasserts that because the personal investigation of Aronov required\n\nby the statute had not been completed before he filed suit, USCIS\n\ncould not legally grant him citizenship.              Second, the government\n\ncites language included by Congress in the 1998 Appropriations Act,\n\nwhich has continuing effect: \"During fiscal year 1998 and each\n\nfiscal year thereafter, none of the funds appropriated or otherwise\n\nmade available to [USCIS] shall be used to complete adjudication of\n\nan application for naturalization unless [USCIS] has received\n\nconfirmation from the Federal Bureau of Investigation that a full\n\ncriminal background check has been completed . . . .\"                 Depts. of\n\nCommerce,   Justice    &   State,   The    Judiciary    &   Related    Agencies\n\nAppropriations Act of 1998, Pub. L. 105-119, Stat. 2440-2448-49\n\n(1997) (8 U.S.C. § 1446 note) (emphasis added).              It asserts that\n\nthis language prevented USCIS from taking final action on Aronov's\n\napplication   before    the   FBI   finished    its    background     check   in\n\nSeptember 2006, after Aronov had filed suit.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -24-\n\f            In response, Aronov argues that neither the language of\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1446(a) nor the 1998 Appropriations Act requires the\n\nUSCIS to undertake the comprehensive FBI name check, which the\n\ngovernment concedes has been the primary cause of the delay in\n\nAronov's proceeding.              Further, he notes that the agency policy\n\ncalling    for    such     name       checks      has        not    been       codified    in    any\n\nregulation.       Finally, he cites a report from the USCIS's ombudsman\n\nthat raised questions about the wisdom of the USCIS policy to\n\nrequire such searches, particularly in light of the significant\n\nbacklog of applicants waiting for their FBI name checks to be\n\ncompleted.\n\n            Before addressing the parties' arguments, we briefly\n\ndiscuss the FBI name check process and the USCIS's use of that\n\nprocess for adjudicating naturalization applications.\n\n                      a. The FBI's National Name Check Program\n\n            The     FBI's       National        Name     Check          Program    (\"NNCP\")       was\n\nestablished during the Eisenhower Administration by Executive Order\n\n10450.      The     NNCP       reviews     information             in    the    FBI's   files      to\n\ndetermine    whether       an     individual           has    been       the    subject    of,    or\n\nmentioned     in,    any        FBI    investigations.                   NNCP     provides       this\n\ninformation to dozens of federal, state, and foreign agencies\n\n\"seeking background information from FBI files on individuals\n\nbefore    bestowing        a    privilege        --     [w]hether          that    privilege       is\n\ngovernment       employment           or   an    appointment;              a    Green     card     or\n\n\n                                                -25-\n\fnaturalization; admission to the bar; or a visa for the privilege\n\nof visiting our homeland.\"           Foreign Travel to the United States:\n\nTestimony Before the H.

The NNCP also \"conducts numerous name\n\nsearches        in   direct     support      of    the     counterintelligence,\n\ncounterterrorism, and homeland security efforts of the FBI.\"                       Id.\n\n            The USCIS commissions the FBI on a fee-for-service basis\n\nto provide the name checks, in accordance with USCIS-defined\n\nstandards.

Until late\n\n2002, the FBI was required to search only its \"main\" files for\n\npossible links between the applicant and an individual who was\n\npreviously the target of an FBI investigation.                      In late 2002,\n\nhowever, in response to heightened security concerns after the\n\nattacks    on    September     11,   2001,   and   an    incident    in    which    an\n\nindividual who was a member of a terrorist group was awarded\n\nbenefits, the USCIS revised its policy and began requiring more\n\ncomprehensive FBI name checks.            These checks entailed a search of\n\nthe FBI's \"reference\" files in addition to its main investigation\n\nfiles.

As currently undertaken, the FBI\n\nname check process entails the following:\n\n          The name is electronically checked against the\n          FBI Universal Indices (UNI).     The searches\n          seek all instances of the individual's name\n          and close date of birth, whether a main file\n          name or reference. . . . The names are\n          searched in a multitude of combinations,\n          switching the order of first, last, middle\n          names, as well as combinations with just the\n          first and last, first and middle, and so on.\n          It also searches different phonetic spelling\n          variations of the names . . . .\n                 If there is a match with a name in a\n          FBI record, it is designated as a 'Hit,'\n          meaning that the system has stopped on a\n          possible match with the name being checked,\n          but now a human being must review the file or\n          indices entry to further refine the names\n          'Hit\" on. . . .\n                 Approximately 85% of name checks are\n          electronically returned as having \"No Record\"\n          within 72 hours. . . . A secondary manual name\n          search usually identifies an additional 10% of\n          the requests as having a \"No Record\" . . . .\n          The remaining 5% are identified as possibly\n          being the subject of an FBI record. The FBI\n          record must now be retrieved and reviewed. If\n          the records were electronically uploaded into\n          the   FBI   Automated   Case   Support   (ACS)\n          electronic recordkeeping system, it can be\n          viewed quickly.

After the USCIS revised\n\nits policy in 2002, that number increased.    Id.   For example, in\n\nthe FBI's fiscal year 2003 alone, it received over 6 million name\n\ncheck requests.    Federal Bureau of Investigation, National Name\n\nCheck Program, http://www.fbi.gov/hq/nationalnamecheck.htm (last\n\nvisited June 27, 2008).    USCIS currently processes approximately\n\n1.5 million applications requiring name checks annually, including\n\napplications both for green cards and for citizenship, and 99% of\n\nthese are cleared by the FBI in less than six months.          Julia\n\nPreston, Rules Eased to Expedite Green Card Applications, N.Y.\n\nTimes, Feb. 12, 2008, at A12.

Statutory Requirements\n\n            There is nothing in the language of 8 U.S.C. 1446(a) or\n\nthe 1998 Appropriations Act that requires USCIS to include the NNCP\n\nin the naturalization process.           Neither provision cited by the\n\ngovernment states explicitly that an FBI name check is required,\n\nlet alone a name check that includes an evaluation of all FBI\n\n\nhttp://www.uscis.gov/files/pressrelease/DOC017.pdf.    This change\ndoes not apply to citizenship applicants because \"revoking\nnaturalization is a much more difficult thing to do\" than revoking\na green card.     Hsu, supra, at A3 (quoting USCIS Spokesman\nChristopher S. Bentley).\n\n                                     -29-\n\freference files in addition to the main files.            Section 1446(a)\n\nrequires only that a \"personal investigation\" be conducted prior to\n\nallowing   an    individual   to   be     naturalized,   while      the   1998\n\nappropriations    bill    limits   funds    to   the   USCIS   to    complete\n\nadjudication of a naturalization application until the agency has\n\nreceived FBI confirmation that a \"full criminal background check\"\n\nhas been completed.      There is no specification in the bill beyond\n\nthis phrase.    It is entirely plausible -- indeed likely -- that the\n\nlanguage used by Congress in the 1998 appropriations bill referred\n\nto the FBI's criminal history check, which is an established,\n\npreliminary step taken in the naturalization process, rather than\n\nthe FBI name check.\n\n           Importantly, the FBI name check program had already been\n\nin place for decades at the time the statutes relied upon by the\n\ngovernment were enacted.      If Congress intended to mandate that the\n\nUSCIS commission FBI name checks before granting naturalization\n\napplications, it could have explicitly referenced such checks.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Cabrera, 208 F.3d 309, 314 (1st Cir.\n\n2000) (examining Congress's other textual options in interpreting\n\nthe statutory language at issue).           Other than an unpersuasive\n\nreliance on the text of the statutes, the government has not\n\n\n\n\n                                   -30-\n\fidentified any evidence that Congress intended to require the FBI\n\nname checks.12\n\n          Indeed, USCIS did not even begin requiring the full,\n\ncomprehensive FBI name checks until 2002, years after passage of\n\nthe applicable statutes. That fact confirms that the comprehensive\n\nname checks were a result of a policy change within the agency\n\n\n\n     12\n       Although the government has not invoked it, a regulation\nrelevant to interpreting the scope of the statutory provisions at\nissue does exist. In full, 8 C.F.R. § 335.2(b) reads:\n\n          Completion of criminal background checks\n          before examination. The Service will notify\n          applicants for naturalization to appear before\n          a Service officer for initial examination on\n          the naturalization application only after the\n          Service has received a definitive response\n          from the Federal Bureau of Investigation that\n          a full criminal background check of an\n          applicant has been completed. A definitive\n          response that a full criminal background check\n          on an applicant has been completed includes:\n\n          (1) Confirmation from the Federal Bureau of\n          Investigation that an applicant does not have\n          an administrative or a criminal record;\n\n          (2) Confirmation from the Federal Bureau of\n          Investigation that an applicant has an\n          administrative or a criminal record; or\n\n          (3) Confirmation from the Federal Bureau of\n          Investigation that two properly prepared\n          fingerprint cards (Form FD-258) have been\n          determined unclassifiable for the purpose of\n          conducting a criminal background check and\n          have been rejected.\n\nThe regulation does not assist the agency's claims because, like\nthe statutes, it gives no indication that a \"full\" criminal\nbackground check includes an FBI name check.\n\n                              -31-\n\fafter the September 11, 2001 attacks rather than a congressional\n\nmandate.13\n\n             In sum, the statutes cited by the government did not\n\nrequire     USCIS   to     commission     FBI    name      checks   --   let   alone\n\ncomprehensive       ones    --   before    adjudicating        a    naturalization\n\napplication.    Therefore, the \"mandated by statute\" rationale fails\n\nas   a    substantial      justification       for   the    agency's     delays   in\n\nadjudicating Aronov's application.\n\n                     c. The Application of Chevron\n\n             Perhaps realizing the flaws in its statutory argument,\n\nthe government offers an alternative basis for finding that its\n\npre-litigation position on Aronov's naturalization application was\n\nsubstantially justified. Relying on Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural\n\nResource Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-45 (1984), the\n\ngovernment asserts that we must defer to the USCIS's decisions\n\nregarding the scope of the \"personal investigation\" and \"full\n\ncriminal background check\" of an applicant for naturalization\n\nbecause Congress, pursuant to the statutes discussed above, has\n\n\n\n     13\n       The USCIS's recent change of policy to grant thousands of\ngreen-card applicants permanent residency before their full FBI\nname checks are completed reinforces this view.      Although the\nagency did not take the same step with respect to naturalization\napplications, it attributed the differential treatment to the\ndifficulty of revising naturalization decisions, not to statutory\nrequirements.    Hsu, supra, at A3 (citing USCIS Spokesman\nChristopher S. Bentley). In so explaining the discrepancy, the\nagency implicitly acknowledged that it was not prohibited by\nlaw from extending the policy to naturalization decisions.\n\n                                        -32-\n\fcommitted to the agency the decision-making authority on these\n\nissues.   The government argues that the agency, having concluded\n\nthat the comprehensive FBI name checks are \"essential\" to the\n\nbackground investigations, was substantially justified in awaiting\n\ncompletion of Aronov's background check before adjudicating his\n\nnaturalization application.           Acknowledging that a small percentage\n\nof name checks take a considerable amount of time to complete, the\n\nagency asserts implicitly that those isolated delays, which are the\n\nfault of the FBI and not USCIS, should not prevent the government\n\nfrom maintaining the name check requirement as its policy and\n\napplying to it Aronov's naturalization application.               That is, the\n\nagency argues that its general policy of requiring the name checks\n\nexcuses   the    delays     associated      with   individual   naturalization\n\napplications, such as Aronov's.\n\n           Even if the government is entitled to invoke Chevron to\n\ndefend its general policy on the FBI name check process, see, e.g.,\n\nCass Sunstein, Chevron Step Zero, 92 Va. L. Rev. 187 (2006)\n\n(analyzing      the    standards   for      determining   whether   an   agency\n\ninterpretation        is   entitled    to    evaluation   under   the    Chevron\n\nframework), deference to its general policies does not require us\n\nto find substantial justification in this particular instance.14\n\n\n     14\n       Aronov argues on a number of grounds that the USCIS's name\ncheck policy is not entitled to Chevron deference. We need not\nreach that question because of our conclusion that even if the\nagency is entitled to Chevron deference for its policy requiring\nFBI name checks, this deference does not substantially justify the\n\n                                       -33-\n\fThe   government's   eighteen-month     delay   in    acting    on   Aronov's\n\nnaturalization application directly contravened § 1447(b), which\n\ngives a district court jurisdiction to evaluate a naturalization\n\napplication if the agency has failed to adjudicate the application\n\nwithin 120 days after conducting its initial examination.                  See\n\nEtape, 497 F.3d at 385; see also Hovsepian, 359 F.3d at 1163 (\"A\n\ncentral purpose of [§ 1447(b)] was to reduce the waiting time for\n\nnaturalization applicants.\" (citing H.R. Rep.

Here, §\n\n\n     15\n         The dissent's treatment of the 120-day time frame\nestablished by 8 U.S.C. § 1447(b) is curious. Although the dissent\nacknowledges that the agency has adopted a regulation, 8 C.F.R. §\n335.3(a), that treats the 120-day time frame as a deadline, the\ndissent treats the statutory and regulatory time frame as merely\naspirational in nature, with no consequence for the agency if it\nfails to comply. If Congress had taken such a relaxed view of its\n120-day time frame, it would not have explicitly provided that an\napplicant whose naturalization application remains unresolved at\nthe end of the 120-day period may file suit in federal court to\nhave the application either adjudicated by the court or remanded to\nthe agency with instructions to adjudicate it. See, e.g., Etape,\n497 F.3d at 384-85 (concluding that after an applicant has filed\nsuit with the district court pursuant to § 1447(b), the court has\nexclusive jurisdiction over the application).\n\n                                      -35-\n\f1447(b) and 8 C.F.R. § 335.3(a)16 provide such guidance.                          See Sze\n\nv. INS, No. C-97-0569 SC, 1997 WL 446236, at *7 (N.D. Cal. July 24,\n\n1997) (\"[T]he 120-day rule provides the court with a measure of\n\nwhat        constitutes    a    reasonable       period     for   INS        to   process\n\nnaturalization applications.\").\n\n               Without foreclosing the possibility that the government\n\ncould provide substantial justification grounded in the facts of a\n\nparticular case for not complying with the 120-day statutory\n\nrequirement, the government has advanced no such particularized\n\njustification here.            Instead, the agency has offered only general\n\njustifications for the delay, including the agency's policy of\n\nrequiring name checks for security purposes and the significant\n\nbacklog of names that the FBI is processing.                  These explanations,\n\nhowever,       do   not   justify   the   agency's        disregard     of    the   clear\n\nstatutory mandate.         As a district court deciding this exact issue\n\nhas aptly stated:\n\n               But while a reasonable person would not\n               dispute   the   necessity   of  conducting   a\n               background    check   on   an  applicant   for\n               naturalization, a reasonable person would\n               require a satisfactory justification for a\n               substantial delay in completing the background\n               check.   Indeed,    government  agencies   are\n               required to conclude matters presented to them\n               within a \"reasonable time.\" See 5 U.S.C. §\n\n\n       16\n        8 C.F.R. § 335.3(a) states: \"A decision to grant or deny the\n[naturalization] application shall be made at the time of the\ninitial examination or within 120-days after the date of the\ninitial examination of the applicant for naturalization under §\n335.2.\"\n\n                                          -36-\n\f           555(b).     Otherwise,    an     applicant    for\n           naturalization remains in perpetual limbo and\n           is by de facto, denied his citizenship, a\n           right that has been afforded by Congress to\n           deserving individuals since the rise of the\n           American democracy. This is particularly true\n           when    Congress    has    enacted    legislation\n           permitting the applicant to apply to federal\n           district court if a decision is not rendered\n           on the application within 120 days of the\n           completion of the examination under 8 U.S.C. §\n           1447(b).     Here,     Defendants     offer    no\n           justification for the delay; rather, they\n           merely state that \"background checks were\n           necessary and had to be completed before the\n           plaintiff could be naturalized.\"             This\n           explanation merely restates, in a conclusory\n           manner, the necessity of completing the\n           background check; it does not justify the\n           delay.\n\nAlghamdi v. Ridge, No. 3:05cv344-RS, 2006 WL 5670940, at *14 (N.D.\n\nFla. Sept. 25, 2006). Although we also acknowledge that the agency\n\nhas   valid   --   indeed   persuasive   --   reasons   for    requiring\n\ncomprehensive FBI name checks under ordinary circumstances, that\n\npolicy determination cannot justify the failure to comply with a\n\nstatutory deadline.   See, e.g., Rotinsulu v. Mukasey, 515 F.3d 68,\n\n72 (1st Cir. 2008) (\"An agency has an obligation to abide by its\n\nown regulations.\").\n\n           Indeed, despite the agency's assertions that the FBI\n\nbacklog was a significant cause of the delays in this case, the\n\nultimate cause of the agency's failure to comply with the law was\n\nits own non-compliance with its regulations.17      If the agency had\n\n\n      17\n       Specifically, the agency failed to comply with 8 C.F.R. §\n335.2(b).   The regulation states: \"The Service will notify\n\n                                 -37-\n\fproperly deferred conducting its initial interview of Aronov until\n\nthe FBI name check process had been completed, the statutory\n\nobligation would not have arisen.18             In its brief, the government\n\nhas neither explained nor justified its non-compliance with 8\n\nC.F.R. § 335.2(b) in connection with Aronov's application or that\n\nof any other naturalization applicant.19\n\n             Therefore,      the    government's      assertion      that    it   was\n\nrequired to wait until Aronov's FBI name check was completed before\n\nfinally adjudicating his naturalization application does not have\n\n\"a reasonable basis in law and fact.\"             Pierce, 487 U.S. at 566 n.2.\n\n\n\napplicants for naturalization to appear before a Service officer\nfor initial examination on the naturalization application only\nafter the Service has received a definitive response from the\nFederal Bureau of Investigation that a full criminal background\ncheck of an applicant has been completed.\" Id.\n      18\n        We acknowledge the oddity that arises because of the\nagency's regulations. If USCIS had complied with its regulations\nand waited to interview Aronov until the FBI name check had been\ncompleted,   his  waiting   time  for   the  completion  of  the\nnaturalization process might have been longer than it was here.\nHowever, this fact does not alter our legal analysis. Once USICS\ngave Aronov his initial interview, it had to confront the clear\ntiming obligation imposed by Congress.\n      19\n         Based on a recent press release issued by USCIS on April 2,\n2008, there appear to be approximately 29,800 applicants whose\nnaturalization applications were submitted to the FBI before May\n2006 and whose interviews have already been completed. The agency\nhas requested that the FBI prioritize their name checks. This is\none piece of a larger, joint plan between the agency and the FBI to\neliminate the backlog of name checks. The FBI also announced its\nintention to have processed all name checks pending for more than\nthree years by May of this year. See News Release, USCIS, USCIS and FBI\nRelease Joint Plan to Eliminate Backlog of FBI Name Checks (Apr. 2, 2008), available at\nhttp://www.uscis.gov/files/article/NameCheck_2Apr08.pdf.\n\n                                        -38-\n\fIndeed, the government's attempt to invoke an administrative policy\n\nto trump an explicit statutory command turns Chevron deference on\n\nits head.      See Stinson v. United States, 508 U.S. 36, 44 (1993)\n\n(\"Under      Chevron,    if    a   statute   is   unambiguous    the     statute\n\ngoverns.\").       In light of the 120-day statutory directive, the\n\nagency's long delay (over four times the statutory period), and the\n\nabsence of any evidence that the government tried to expedite\n\nAronov's application to comply with the statute, the government's\n\nconduct toward Aronov can only be classified as unreasonable and\n\nnot substantially justified.          See Russell v. Nat'l Mediation Bd.,\n\n775   F.2d     1284,    1290   (5th   Cir.   1985)      (concluding    that   the\n\ngovernment's position was not substantially justified because it\n\nbreached a clear statutory mandate). Accordingly, we conclude that\n\nthe district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that the\n\ngovernment's      pre-litigation       conduct     was     not   substantially\n\njustified.20\n\n                                      III.\n\n              For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's\n\norder      granting    Aronov's    application    for    attorney's    fees   and\n\nexpenses under 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A).            Additionally, we remand\n\nthe matter to the district court so that the fee award may be\n\n\n\n      20\n       We also conclude that the district court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in finding that there are no \"special circumstances\n[that] make an award [of attorney's fees] unjust.\" See Schock, 254\nF.3d at 4 (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A)).\n\n                                      -39-\n\frecalculated to reflect the fees and expenses associated with this\n\nappeal.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n                 -- Dissenting Opinion Follows –\n\n\n\n\n                              -40-\n\f          LYNCH, Chief Judge, dissenting.

INS, 502 U.S. 129, 137 (1991).          The Act requires a\n\ncourt to award fees and expenses to a prevailing party in a civil\n\naction against the United States unless the court finds that the\n\nposition of the United States was substantially justified, or that\n\nspecial   circumstances    make   an     award   unjust.   28   U.S.C.   §\n\n2412(d)(1)(a).   The purpose of the Act was to \"ensure that certain\n\nindividuals . . . will not be deterred from seeking review of, or\n\ndefending against, unjustified governmental action because of the\n\nexpense involved . . . .

It imposes on United States Citizenship and Immigration\n\nServices (\"USCIS\") the costs of plaintiff's attorneys' fees when\n\nthe agency at all times acted in accordance with the law.              It also\n\nimposes such costs on the agency for attempting to resolve the\n\nmatter by agreement and withdrawing the issue from the court and\n\nback to the agency so that the agency could give the relief the\n\nplaintiff sought.       It also has the practical effect of draining\n\nresources from an agency which is already struggling to do its job.\n\n                                        I.\n\n             In my view, plaintiff is not a prevailing party. A party\n\nis prevailing for EAJA purposes if there is a material alteration\n\nin   the    party's   position   that    bears    a   \"judicial   imprimatur.\"\n\nBuckhannon Bd. & Care Home, Inc. v. W. Va. Dep't of Health & Human\n\nRes., 532 U.S. 598, 604-05 (2001).               In Buckhannon, the Supreme\n\nCourt noted two specific ways in which a party can prevail: by\n\nobtaining a judgment on the merits or a consent decree in its\n\nfavor.       Id. at 605.    Other circuits have read Buckhannon as\n\nallowing parties to prevail if they receive the equivalent of a\n\nconsent decree or some other form of judicial relief that both\n\naffects a material alteration and bears a judicial imprimatur. See\n\nSmith v. Fitchburg Pub. Sch., 401 F.3d 16, 23-24 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nThis circuit has not taken a position on the issue.               Id. at 23.\n\n             The majority focuses on the first situation, asking\n\n\"whether the district court's order was the functional equivalent\n\n\n                                    -42-\n\fof a consent decree.\"         The majority distinguishes this circuit's\n\ndecision in Smith on the ground that Smith was not concerned with\n\nwhether the orders in question were the equivalent of a consent\n\ndecree.    However, as in Smith, here the question of whether the\n\norder was the equivalent of a consent decree was not raised by\n\neither party, nor was that the theory on which the district court\n\nrelied.    Thus the issue was waived.        Id. at 24 (the issue is waived\n\nif not presented by the parties).               Instead, the parties and\n\ndistrict    court   focused    on   the   second   situation:   whether   the\n\ndistrict court's order put the necessary judicial imprimatur on the\n\nchange in Aronov's legal status.            The majority should not create\n\narguments the parties and the district court did not use, nor do so\n\nto justify its result.\n\n            But even if the issue had not been waived, the district\n\ncourt's brief order remanding the case is not the equivalent of a\n\nconsent decree.     The order contains no statement incorporating an\n\nagreement between the parties or requiring that either party act in\n\na particular way.     All the order does is to remand the case at the\n\nrequest of the agency.        The order here thus differs from the ones\n\ncited by the majority which other circuits have found to be the\n\nfunctional equivalent of consent decrees.          See, e.g., Carbonell v.\n\nINS, 429 F.3d 894, 897 (9th Cir. 2005) (district court incorporated\n\nparties' stipulation into an order); Truesdell v. Phila. Hous.\n\nAuth., 290 F.3d 159, 162 (3d Cir. 2002) (district court order\n\n\n                                     -43-\n\fincluded detailed terms of parties' settlement); Am. Disability\n\nAss'n v. Chmielarz, 289 F.3d 1315, 1317 (11th Cir. 2002) (parties'\n\nsettlement was \"approved, adopted, and ratified\" by the district\n\ncourt in an order where the court expressly retained jurisdiction).\n\n             As the Supreme Court has made clear, the distinction is\n\nmaterial: \"The situation would be quite different if the parties'\n\nobligation to comply with the terms of the settlement agreement had\n\nbeen made part of the order . . . .\"             Kokkonen v. Guardian Life\n\nIns. Co. of Am., 511 U.S. 375, 381 (1994).             It is quite clear that\n\na   \"judge's      mere   awareness   and   approval    of   the   terms   of   the\n\nsettlement agreement do not suffice to make them part of his\n\norder.\"     Id.\n\n             I would hold that the district court's order lacks the\n\nnecessary judicial imprimatur to entitle Aronov to prevailing party\n\nstatus.     Our circuit precedent in Smith requires that result.               The\n\nmajority's treatment of the order as the functional equivalent of\n\na consent decree is inconsistent with our holding in Smith.22                  That\n\ncase    involved    an   administrative      hearing   officer's    pre-hearing\n\norders, some of which were accompanied by the threat of sanctions,\n\nwhich \"memorialized the voluntary concessions made by [defendant]\n\nand attempted to keep the settlement process moving forward in a\n\n\n\n       22\n          The majority also suggests that Smith is somehow\ndifferent   because  the   orders  in   question came   from  an\nadministrative hearing officer rather than a district court, but\nSmith lends no support to that proposition.\n\n                                      -44-\n\ftimely manner.\"   Smith, 401 F.3d at 26.     We held that these orders,\n\nalthough they imposed specific requirements on defendant, did not\n\nhave sufficient judicial imprimatur to make plaintiff a prevailing\n\nparty because they simply made defendant \"follow through with what\n\n[defendant] had already voluntarily promised to do.\"             Id. at 27.\n\nThat is exactly the case here.            The district court's remand\n\npermitted USCIS to follow through with its announced intention to\n\nmake Aronov a citizen by November 8, 2006.        USCIS had voluntarily\n\nagreed to do so before it requested the remand.        As in Smith, the\n\nremand may have kept the process moving in a timely manner, but\n\nthat is not enough to make Aronov a prevailing party.             His claim\n\nunder the EAJA should have stopped there.\n\n                                    II.\n\n           I also disagree with the majority that the government's\n\npre-litigation position was not substantially justified.\n\n           The Supreme Court has interpreted the \"substantially\n\njustified\" language in the EAJA: \"[A]s between the two commonly\n\nused   connotations   of   the   word   'substantially,'   the    one   most\n\nnaturally conveyed by the phrase before us here is not 'justified\n\nto a high degree,' but rather 'justified in substance or in the\n\nmain' -- that is, justified to a degree that could satisfy a\n\nreasonable person.\" Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U.S. 552, 565 (1988);\n\nsee also, e.g., Schock v. United States, 254 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.\n\n2001); Dantran, Inc. v. U.S. Dep't of Labor, 246 F.3d 36, 40-41\n\n\n                                   -45-\n\f(1st Cir. 2001).        The government's position is substantially\n\njustified if required by law.     See Dantran, 246 F.3d at 41; United\n\nStates v. One Parcel of Real Prop. With Bldgs., 960 F.2d 200, 208-\n\n09 (1st Cir. 1992).     That was true here.\n\n           The government's position may be substantially justified\n\neven if its reasonable interpretation of its legal obligations is\n\nnot ultimately affirmed by a court.          Schock, 254 F.3d at 5.     This\n\ncourt earlier reversed a district court for abuse of discretion in\n\ngranting   attorneys'    fees   when   the    government    \"was   at   least\n\nreasonable\" in denying a visa because it wanted to \"communicate the\n\nattitude of the United States government toward the activities of\n\nthe Soviet Union,\" even though the visa applicant's interpretation\n\nof the underlying law ultimately prevailed.         Allende v. Baker, 891\n\nF.2d 7, 12, 13 (1st Cir. 1989); see also, e.g., Li v. Keisler, 505\n\nF.3d 913, 920 (9th Cir. 2007) (\"In the absence of guidance from\n\nthis   court,   the     government's     position     was    substantially\n\njustified.\"); Bricks, Inc. v. U.S. EPA, 426 F.3d 918, 924 (7th Cir.\n\n2005) (although EPA was unsuccessful in its attempt to show a\n\nhydrological connection, it was still substantially justified in\n\ndoing so).\n\n           Here, the government argues that USCIS's pre-litigation\n\nposition was substantially justified because that position was\n\ntaken pursuant to federal law.           In particular, the government\n\npoints to two congressional enactments with which it has complied\n\n\n                                  -46-\n\fhere.     The first is 8 U.S.C. § 1446(a), which provides that\n\n\"[b]efore a person may be naturalized, an employee of the [USCIS],\n\nor of the United States designated by the Attorney General, shall\n\nconduct       a    personal   investigation      of    the   person   applying     for\n\nnaturalization.\"           The second is language included by Congress in\n\nthe 1998 Appropriations Act which has continuing effect: \"[D]uring\n\nfiscal year 1998 and each fiscal year thereafter, none of the funds\n\nappropriated or otherwise made available to [USCIS] shall be used\n\nto complete adjudication of an application for naturalization\n\nunless [USCIS] has received confirmation from the Federal Bureau of\n\nInvestigation that a full criminal background check has been\n\ncompleted . . . .\"                Dep'ts of Commerce, Justice & State, The\n\nJudiciary & Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1998, Pub.

In\n\nthe end, the award here turns on the majority's view that USCIS did\n\nnot need to include the FBI name check as part of a \"full\" check,\n\nand that the agency's compliance with its name check policy renders\n\nits    pre-litigation         position   here    (to   await    the   results     of    a\n\nrequested         name    check)   not   substantially       justified.     But    the\n\nagency's policy and its pre-litigation decision to comply with its\n\npolicy were entirely reasonable.\n\n\n                                          -47-\n\f                  The question before us is not whether the language in 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1446 and the 1998 Appropriations Act specifically requires\n\nthat FBI name checks be part of the background check on citizenship\n\napplicants,         but   whether   the   agency's   interpretation       of   these\n\nstatutes as requiring FBI name checks to fulfill its statutory\n\nresponsibilities renders its position not substantially justified.\n\nThe position is substantially justified because it was a reasonable\n\ninterpretation of a legislative command23 and that interpretation\n\nwas committed to the agency's expertise.\n\n                  Principles of administrative law require that courts\n\ndefer        to   reasonable   interpretations       by   agencies   of    matters\n\ncommitted to the agency's expertise by Congress.

The broad language\nused by Congress lets the agency determine how best to perform a\nfull criminal background check and does not limit the agency to a\nparticular type of check.     There is no evidence, textual or\notherwise, that Congress intended to require the agency not to use\nFBI name checks.\n\n                                          -48-\n\fmake.   Even if a reviewing court disagrees with the agency's\n\nconclusions, it cannot substitute its judgment for that of the\n\nagency.\").   We also note that we are describing a consistent USCIS\n\ninterpretation and practice, not one adopted for purposes of the\n\nissues in this attorneys' fees litigation.\n\n            USCIS, not the majority, has the expertise to determine\n\nwhat should constitute a full criminal background check.                       The\n\nconcern that applicants be adequately vetted before they become\n\ncitizens has taken on added urgency in an age where terrorism is a\n\nreality and a continuing threat.            That the agency came to decide in\n\n2002 that the inclusion of FBI name checks provided better full\n\ncriminal background investigations only undercuts the majority's\n\nposition.\n\n            The majority holds that although a court might ordinarily\n\ndefer to USCIS's policy of using FBI name checks to fulfill its\n\nstatutory    mandate        to   complete     background      investigations    on\n\ncitizenship applicants, here we cannot do so because the agency\n\ncontravened 8 U.S.C. § 1447(b).          The statute permits a citizenship\n\napplicant to file suit in federal district court if USCIS fails to\n\nadjudicate his application within 120 days of conducting an initial\n\nexamination.      The majority places great weight on this provision,\n\ntreating    it    as    a   \"statutory   mandate\"      that    the   agency    must\n\nadjudicate       an    application    within     120   days     of   an   initial\n\n\n\n\n                                       -49-\n\fexamination.    That is plainly not what the statute says.     It says\n\nonly that suit may be brought within 120 days of the examination.\n\n          The    provision's    legislative   history   discusses     the\n\nimportance of eliminating delays but says nothing about imposing a\n\ndeadline on the agency, only that after 120 days relief can be\n\nsought in federal court.       See 135 Cong. Rec. H4539-02, 4542-43,\n\n1989 WL 182156 (daily ed. July 31, 1989).      Thus the authorization\n\nto file suit in district court is meant to encourage the agency to\n\nact fast, but that does not mean that Congress meant to impose a\n\nstrict deadline on the agency.        Indeed, if Congress wanted to\n\nimpose a strict deadline, it could have done so directly.           It is\n\ntrue that the agency's regulations suggest that it treat the 120-\n\nday provision as an internal deadline, see 8 C.F.R. § 335.3(a), but\n\nthat does not create a \"statutory mandate.\"       The statute simply\n\ngoverns the timing of suits.24\n\n          Corresponding with its view that 8 U.S.C. § 1447(b)\n\ncreates a mandate, the majority suggests that the government would\n\n\n     24\n          Additionally, the cases the majority cites for the\nproposition that the statute creates a deadline involved different\nquestions. United States v. Hovsepian, 359 F.3d 1144 (9th Cir.\n2004), was concerned with the question of whether exclusive\njurisdiction rests in the district court after 120 days, and it\nprovided no analysis or support for its observation that § 1447(b)\n\"requires the INS to make a decision . . . within 120 days.\" Id.\nat 1161. Walji v. Gonzales, 500 F.3d 432 (5th Cir. 2007), involved\nthe question of when the 120-day period begins to run and used the\nlanguage \"the statute is violated in situations such as\n[petitioner's]\" in the context of supporting its conclusion that\nthe 120-day period applies from the time the examination, and not\nthe entire background check, is completed. Id. at 439.\n\n                                  -50-\n\fhave to make a very strong showing in order to justify missing the\n\n120-day mark.      It also faults the government for not advancing a\n\n\"particularized justification\" regarding Aronov and why a name\n\ncheck was necessary for him.         In my view both rationales are wrong\n\non their own terms and both miss the point.\n\n             Even reading the statute as imposing a deadline on the\n\nagency, the majority is nonetheless wrong because there is nothing\n\nto say that 8 U.S.C. § 1447(b) was meant to trump the agency's\n\nobligations to see that an applicant meets the requirements for\n\ncitizenship or to trump the agency's mandate to conduct a full\n\ncriminal background check.\n\n             Here the agency made a mistake by conducting Aronov's\n\ninitial     examination     before   it    had   completed   his    background\n\ninvestigation, including obtaining the results from the FBI of his\n\nname check.25 Bureaucracies make mistakes. Given this mistake, the\n\nrelevant question is whether it was unreasonable for the agency to\n\nproceed with the name check even though doing so meant that Aronov\n\ncould     pursue   relief   in   federal   court   because   of    the   120-day\n\nprovision.\n\n             I would hold that it was not unreasonable for USCIS to\n\nmiss the 120-day mark in order to complete a name check before\n\ngranting Aronov citizenship.         No \"particularized justification\" is\n\n\n\n     25\n          There is no question that doing so was an error.                See 8\nC.F.R. § 335.2(b).\n\n                                      -51-\n\fnecessary because the entire point of conducting name checks is\n\nthat the government does not know what the check will uncover.        As\n\nUSCIS has stated,\n\n           Although these security checks may require a\n           more lengthy processing time, USCIS believes\n           that   performing   them   is   essential   to\n           identifying national security and public\n           safety concerns that would not have been\n           uncovered   by   other   means.      This   is\n           particularly true given that in[] a few cases,\n           the information obtained from the FBI through\n           this process has reflected very significant\n           issues and risks.    FBI name checks disclose\n           information to USCIS that is otherwise not\n           available. . . . USCIS is committed to\n           effective background checks, and thus is\n           committed to the FBI name check.\n\nUSCIS,   Response   to   the   Citizenship   and   Immigration   Services\n\nOmbudsman's 2006 Report, at 10, available at http://www.dhs.gov/\n\nxlibrary/assets/USCIS-Response-Ombudsman-06-Report-May-2007.pdf.\n\n           Moreover, as the majority points out, although USCIS\n\nrecently eliminated the name check requirement for visa applicants\n\nin order to lessen its backlog, it has not done so for citizenship\n\napplicants for the very sensible reason that once a person is\n\ngranted citizenship, that decision is not easily reversed.         There\n\nis nothing unreasonable about USCIS's decision to postpone a\n\ndecision on Aronov's application for citizenship until obtaining\n\ninformation about whether the name check revealed risks to national\n\nsecurity or public safety, even if doing so meant that a decision\n\ncould not be reached within 120 days of his examination.\n\n\n\n                                   -52-\n\f           Indeed, the case law also provides no basis for the award\n\nhere.     USCIS's pre-litigation position in this case bears no\n\nresemblance to pre-litigation positions that courts have found not\n\nto be substantially justified.          In Healey v. Leavitt, 485 F.3d 63\n\n(2d Cir. 2007), the Second Circuit held that the government's pre-\n\nlitigation   position      was   not   substantially    justified   when   the\n\ngovernment \"failed to offer any justification for the Secretary's\n\nfailure to require [home health agencies] to provide written notice\n\nof the termination of benefits.\"              Id. at 67.   Here the agency\n\npoints to statutes forbidding it to grant citizenship before\n\ncertain actions are taken.         In Sierra Club v. Secretary of Army,\n\n820 F.2d 513 (1st Cir. 1987), this court held that an agency's\n\nrefusal to prepare an environmental impact statement for a project\n\nwas unreasonable when there was significant evidence that the\n\nproject   required   one    and    several    other   federal   agencies   had\n\nadvocated for one and warned that one might be legally required.\n\nId. at 519-20 (citing Sierra Club v. Marsh, 769 F.2d 868, 874-75\n\n(1st Cir. 1985)).    Here, the agency did not act contrary to law,\n\nbut according to its reasonable interpretation of the law.\n\n                                       III.\n\n           The majority opinion will, in my view, have a number of\n\nunfortunate consequences.         The majority holds that the government,\n\nby acting reasonably and requesting a remand so that it could grant\n\nAronov citizenship, exposed itself to liability under the EAJA\n\n\n                                       -53-\n\fbecause Aronov necessarily became a prevailing party once the court\n\ngranted the remand.    This will discourage USCIS from acting to\n\nresolve these cases in a similarly efficient and amicable way in\n\nthe future.   The majority also says that it would be very difficult\n\nfor the government to show that it was substantially justified in\n\nmissing the 120-day mark to act on a citizenship application.   The\n\nmajority would thus discourage USCIS from conducting investigations\n\nof applicants that could turn up important information but would\n\nrequire longer than 120 days after the applicant's examination for\n\nthe agency to make a final determination.   Ultimately the decision\n\ncould be contrary to the interests of applicants because in the\n\nface of incomplete information, the agency might choose the safer\n\ncourse of denying citizenship.\n\n          I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -54-\n\f",

The act provides that a court shall award fees and expenses to a prevailing party in a civil action against the United States unless the court finds that the position of the government was substantially justified or that other circumstances make an award unjust.</p>\n<p>Aronov filed the action in this case to force the government to act on his long-pending application for naturalization. The district court awarded him attorney's fees under the EAJA on the grounds that he was the prevailing party in the litigation and that the pre-litigation position taken by the government was not substantially justified. We affirm the district court's award.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>A native of Russia and a permanent resident of the United States since 2001, Aronov applied for naturalization with the Vermont Service Center of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\") on May 22, 2004. After initial processing and completion of the required fingerprint check, Aronov's case was forward to the Boston USCIS office. Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1446(b) and 8 C.F.R. § 335.2(a), Aronov was interviewed on February 14, 2005 regarding his application. However, as the government acknowledges, the agency's interview with Aronov was premature. The agency's own regulation dictates that an initial examination should be undertaken only after an applicant's full background check has been completed. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. § 335.2(b) (\"The Service will notify applicants for naturalization to appear before a Service officer for initial examination on the naturalization application only after the Service has received a definitive response from the Federal Bureau of Investigation that a full criminal background check of an applicant has been completed.\"). The government has not explained why it did not follow its regulation in this case.</p>\n<p>At the time of the interview, Aronov was informed that his application could not be approved until additional security checks were completed. After hearing nothing from the USCIS for more than a year, Aronov received a letter from the agency on March 23, 2006 informing him that his application was being actively processed, but that additional review was required. The notice also instructed Aronov to contact USCIS if he did not receive a decision within six months of the date of the notice.</p>\n<p>On August 28, 2006, more than eighteen months after being interviewed by the agency, Aronov filed an action in the district court under 8 U.S.C. § 1447(b), requesting that the court grant his application for naturalization or, alternatively, remand his application with instructions <span class=\"star-pagination\">*33</span> to the agency to adjudicate it.<sup>[1]</sup> Five weeks later, on October 6, the government and Aronov filed a Joint Motion for Remand Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1447(b). In full, the joint motion read:</p>\n<blockquote>Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1447(b), the parties in this action, plaintiff ... and defendants Michael Chertoff, Secretary of the United States Department of Homeland Security, et al., hereby jointly move this Honorable Court to remand this matter to the USCIS, so that [it] can grant plaintiff's application for naturalization, and schedule plaintiff's oath ceremony for no later than November 8, 2006. In support of this motion, the parties state as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>1. On or about August 28, 2006, plaintiff Alexandre Aronov filed this action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>2. Since that date, USCIS has completed its review of plaintiff's application for naturalization and, if jurisdiction is returned to the agency, would grant the application and schedule plaintiff's oath ceremony for no later than November 8, 2006.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>3. The governing statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1447(b), provides that, in cases in which the agency has failed to render a decision on an application for naturalization within 120 days of the examination of the applicant, the applicant may file suit in district court requesting to adjudicate the application and \"[s]uch court has jurisdiction over the matter and may either determine the matter or remand the matter, with appropriate instructions, to the Service to determine the matter.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Wherefore, with good cause having been shown, the parties respectfully request that this Court remand this matter to USCIS so that it can grant plaintiff's application for naturalization and schedule plaintiff for an oath ceremony for no later than November 8, 2006.</blockquote>\n<p>On October 12, 2006, the court entered an electronic order granting the motion and the remand. The docket text for the remand order states: \"Judge Nancy Gertner: Electronic ORDER entered granting <i>3</i> Joint Motion to Remand to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\"<sup>[2]</sup> Aronov was sworn in as a U.S. citizen on November 8, 2006.</p>\n<p>On November 28, 2006, Aronov filed an application for attorney's fees pursuant to the EAJA. The statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote>Except as otherwise specifically provided by statute, a court shall award to a prevailing party other than the United States fees and other expenses, in addition to any costs awarded pursuant to subsection (a), incurred by that party in any civil action (other than cases sounding in tort), including proceedings for judicial review of agency action, brought by or against the United States in any court having jurisdiction of that action, unless the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.</blockquote>\n<p>28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A). The government opposed the application, asserting <span class=\"star-pagination\">*34</span> that Aronov was not a prevailing party in the litigation under the test established in <i>Buckhannon Board and Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources,</i> 532 U.S. 598, 121 S.Ct. 1835, 149 L.Ed.2d 855 (2001), and that the government's position regarding his application was substantially justified. The district court agreed with Aronov and ordered the government to pay him $4,270.94 in attorney's fees and costs. The government appeals this decision.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Although parties are ordinarily required, win or lose, to bear their own attorney's fees, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. v. Wilderness Soc'y,</i> 421 U.S. 240, 247, 95 S.Ct. 1612, 44 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975), a number of exceptions to this default rule have been adopted by statute. One such exception, the EAJA, authorizes the award of attorney's fees and costs to a litigant who has brought a civil suit against the United States if (1) she is the prevailing party in the matter; (2) the government fails to show that its position was substantially justified; and (3) no special circumstances would make such an award unjust. 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A); <i>see also </i><i>Schock v. United States,</i> 254 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2001). By offering qualifying litigants attorney's fees and other expenses, the EAJA seeks \"to remove economic deterrents to parties who seek review of unreasonable government action.\" <i>Schock,</i> 254 F.3d at 4.</p>\n<p>We review the district court's decision to grant or deny a fee application under the EAJA for abuse of discretion, <i>id.,</i> \"mindful that the district court has an 'intimate knowledge of the nuances of the underlying case,'\" <i>New England Regional Council of Carpenters v. Kinton,</i> 284 F.3d 9, 30 (1st Cir.2002) (quoting <i>Gay Officers Action League v. Puerto Rico,</i> 247 F.3d 288, 292 (1st Cir.2001)). \"Such deference is particularly appropriate where, as here, the correctness of the court's decision depends in large part on the proper characterization of its own statements.\" <i>Id.</i> We apply this standard to both the prevailing party and substantial justification determinations. <i>Pierce v. Underwood,</i> 487 U.S. 552, 558-63, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988) (substantial justification); <i>McDonald v. Secretary of HHS,</i> 884 F.2d 1468 (1st Cir.1989) (prevailing party). An error of law is always an abuse of discretion. <i>Rosario-Urdaz v. Rivera-Hernandez,</i> 350 F.3d 219, 221 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Prevailing Party</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. The District Court's Decision</h2>\n<p>The district court began its attorney's fees analysis by addressing whether Aronov was a prevailing party under the EAJA. Invoking the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Buckhannon,</i> the district court found that the first requirement of the prevailing party standard  whether there was \"a material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties\"  was indisputably met because Aronov's status had changed from legal permanent resident to U.S. citizen. The government does not dispute that this requirement has been satisfied.</p>\n<p>Proceeding to the second element of the test  whether there was a \"judicial imprimatur<sup>[3]</sup> on the change\" in status  the court rejected the government's assertion that the imprimatur requirement had not been met here because the agency had acted voluntarily to grant Aronov's naturalization application. Instead, the court concluded that the remand order satisfied <span class=\"star-pagination\">*35</span> the second element set forth in <i>Buckhannon</i> because the order effectuated the change in legal status that Aronov had sought. The court indicated that the remand did not merely return jurisdiction to USCIS. It also mandated the agency's compliance with a November 8, 2006 deadline for granting Aronov's naturalization. The court noted that \"[w]here the government in <i>Buckhannon</i> took its conciliatory action purely voluntarily, and took on no further duties in the dismissal, the government here was granted not a dismissal, but a remand to the agency <i>conditional</i> on the granting of plaintiff's naturalization action by November 8, 2006.\" (emphasis in original). It asserted, therefore, that \"[h]ad the naturalization not so occurred, the parties might very well be back in front of this court litigating a contempt action. This is far more than a catalyst theory  it was an order of the Court.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Buckhannon</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The issue in <i>Buckhannon</i> was whether a legislative change that effectively awarded petitioner its sought-after relief could provide the basis for a statutory fee award.<sup>[4]</sup> The plaintiff was an operator of assisted living homes who failed a state fire inspection because some of the residents of plaintiff's homes were not capable of \"self-preservation,\" as defined by West Virginia law. On behalf of itself and other parties similarly situated, the home operator brought suit against the state, two state agencies, and several individuals, seeking injunctive and declaratory relief to the effect that the \"self-preservation\" requirement violated provisions of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (\"FHAA\") and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\"ADA\"). Before the federal district court decided the issue, the West Virginia legislature eliminated the \"self-preservation\" requirement by statute. The court subsequently granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the case.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs filed an application for attorney's fees under the FHAA and the ADA, which was denied by both the district court and the Fourth Circuit. The Supreme Court affirmed. The Court held that petitioner could not obtain a fee award in the matter because the legal change had not been judicially sanctioned by a court. <i>Buckhannon,</i> 532 U.S. at 605, 121 S.Ct. 1835 (\"[D]efendant's voluntary change in conduct, although perhaps accomplishing what the plaintiff sought to achieve by the lawsuit, lack[ed] the necessary judicial <i>imprimatur.</i>\"). The Court explicitly rejected the notion that a party is entitled to attorney's fees simply because the underlying litigation triggered her sought-after relief-the so-called \"catalyst theory.\" <i>Id.</i> It noted that previously it had \"only awarded attorney's fees where the plaintiff ha[d] received a judgment on the merits or obtained a court-ordered consent decree,\" but not \"where the plaintiff ha[d] secured the reversal of a directed verdict, or acquired a judicial pronouncement that the defendant ha[d] violated the Constitution unaccompanied by <i>judicial</i> relief,\" <i>id.</i> at 605-06, 121 S.Ct. 1835 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). <span class=\"star-pagination\">*36</span> A private settlement not incorporated into a court order does not confer prevailing party status. <i>See id.</i> at 606, 121 S.Ct. 1835 (\"Never have we awarded attorney's fees for a <i>nonjudicial</i> alteration of actual circumstances.\") (emphasis added) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>Smith v. Fitchburg Public Schools</i>\n</h2>\n<p>As a circuit, we have applied <i>Buckhannon</i> in a number of cases, <i>see </i><i>Smith v. Fitchburg Public Schools,</i> 401 F.3d 16, 22 (1st Cir.2005) (applying the Supreme Court's decision in the context of an action under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\"IDEA\")); <i>Doe v. Boston Public Schools,</i> 358 F.3d 20, 22-26 (1st Cir.2004) (similar analysis); <i>Kinton,</i> 284 F.3d at 30 (declining to award attorney's fees because the district court had not entered any order \"compelling, or even leading to\" the plaintiff receiving the relief it had requested), each time evaluating the specific facts of the case to determine whether the court's conduct was sufficient to \"provide the necessary judicial imprimatur on the change in the legal relationship between the parties,\" <i>Smith,</i> 401 F.3d at 23 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>The government relies in particular on our <i>Smith</i> decision. There, the parents of a disabled child initiated a proceeding under the IDEA against the Fitchburg Public Schools, seeking special education services for their child. After several pre-hearing orders by a hearing officer of the Bureau of Special Education Appeals (\"BSEA\"), the entity in charge of overseeing the proceeding, the parties reached a private settlement that provided the plaintiffs all of the relief they had sought. The plaintiffs subsequently filed an action in the district court seeking to recover attorney's fees pursuant to the IDEA. They argued that the orders of the BSEA, which required the school district to take certain actions and set deadlines for those actions, served as the necessary \"judicial imprimatur\" to grant them \"prevailing party\" status. <i>Id.</i> at 22.</p>\n<p>After recognizing that the administrative relief was not in the form of a consent decree or a final judgment on the merits, and that the plaintiffs had not argued that the administrative orders were functionally equivalent to a consent decree, we addressed in <i>Smith</i> whether the facts of the case generally met the two required elements of <i>Buckhannon.</i><sup>[5]</sup> Acknowledging that the plaintiffs had achieved a material change in the parties' relationship  thereby satisfying the first prong of <i>Buckhannon,</i> we rejected the plaintiffs' claim for attorney's fees on the ground that the BSEA orders had not provided sufficient \"judicial imprimatur\" on the relief obtained. <i>Id.</i> at 27. On this issue, we observed that when the administrative orders were imposed, the BSEA had not yet begun to analyze the plaintiffs' substantive claim  whether they were entitled to relief pursuant to the IDEA  because it had yet to convene a due process hearing. <i>Id.</i> at 26-27. The BSEA's decisions, therefore, were not substantive ones made after reviewing the merits of plaintiffs' claims, but rather orders directing Fitchburg to do what it had already promised the plaintiffs it would do. <i>Id.</i> at 27. Accordingly, the \"orders and ruling were [not] issued ... to place the weight of judicial authority behind Fitchburg's substantive concession that [plaintiff] was entitled to an IEP,\" and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*37</span> hence the relief obtained by the plaintiffs lacked the necessary judicial imprimatur. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. Applying <i>Buckhannon</i> and <i>Smith</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Citing <i>Smith,</i> the government contends that the district court's remand order did not provide the necessary \"judicial imprimatur\" for Aronov's sought-after remedy, naturalization. The government maintains that it already had voluntarily decided to grant Aronov's application. It then established a specific time-frame for doing so, and the court order merely \"memorialized\" the government's independent concessions, as it did in <i>Smith.</i> Further, the remand order did not include any \"appropriate instructions\" directing the government to take specific action, <i>see</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1447(b), or retain jurisdiction in order to determine whether the government followed through on its voluntary decision to approve Aronov's application. Accordingly, the order had no substantive effect on the proceeding and, therefore, did not constitute a \"judicial imprimatur,\" as the Supreme Court defined it in <i>Buckhannon</i> and as we applied the standard in <i>Smith.</i></p>\n<p>We reject the government's arguments and find its reliance on <i>Smith</i> misplaced. Most of the language from <i>Smith</i> relied upon by the government comes in that portion of the panel's decision where it assesses whether the plaintiff's relief, \"even though not in the form of a consent decree or a final judgment on the merits, comports with the overarching requirements of <i>Buckhannon;</i> that is, whether the [administrative hearing officer's involvement] provided the necessary judicial imprimatur on a material alteration of the legal relationship between the parties.\" <i>Smith,</i> 401 F.3d at 26. As the panel noted, \"[the plaintiff] does not argue that the order dismissing her case is the functional equivalent of a consent decree, and thus we deem that argument waived.\" <i>Id.</i> at 24. Moreover, the <i>Smith</i> panel assessed whether the order of an administrative hearing officer, rather than the order of a judge, meets the prevailing party standard set forth in <i>Buckhannon.</i> Since the administrative law analog to a judicial consent decree is uncertain, the focus of the panel in <i>Smith</i> was whether the administrative orders were akin to a judgment on the merits. In short, the <i>Smith</i> decision has little relevance to the prevailing party issue here, which turns on whether the district court's order was the functional equivalent of a consent decree.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, though offered as dicta, the <i>Smith</i> panel made some useful observations about the concept of the functional equivalent of a consent decree. Specifically, the panel distinguished between a court's incorporation of the terms of an agreement between the parties, which made the court order functionally equivalent to a consent decree, and mere recognition of an agreement accompanied by the dismissal of the case because there is no longer a dispute, which was not equivalent to a consent decree. Relying on the Fourth Circuit's decision in <i>Smyth v. Rivero</i><i>,</i> the panel put that critical difference in these terms:</p>\n<blockquote>Thus, \"either incorporation of the terms of the agreement or a separate provision retaining jurisdiction over the agreement will suffice for [an order to be considered the functional equivalent of a consent decree]\" ... In contrast, \"[w]here a court merely recognizes the fact of the parties' agreement and dismisses the case because there is no longer a dispute before it, the terms of the agreement are not made part of the order and consequently will not serve as a basis of jurisdiction.\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>Smith,</i> 401 F.3d at 24 (quoting <i>Smyth v. Rivero,</i> 282 F.3d 268, 283 (4th Cir.2002)).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*38</span> Here, the district court held that its remand order fell under the first category of orders  where the court incorporates the terms of the parties' agreement into an order  rather than the second where the court merely recognizes the agreement and dismisses the matter as no longer in dispute. As the district court put it:</p>\n<blockquote>In <i>Buckhannon,</i> the government acted independently to give the plaintiff what it wanted, and <i>then</i> sought dismissal. Here, <i>the</i> Court remanded specifically \"so that USCIS can grant plaintiff's application for naturalization, and schedule plaintiff's oath ceremony for no later than November 8, 2006.\" This is the judicial imprimatur required by and lacking in the specific facts of <i>Buckhannon.</i> Where the government in <i>Buckhannon</i> took its conciliatory action purely voluntarily, and took on no further duties in the dismissal, the government here was granted not a dismissal, but a remand to the agency <i>conditional on</i> the granting of plaintiff's naturalization by November 8, 2006. Had the naturalization not so occurred, the parties might very well be back in front of this Court litigating a contempt action. This is far more than a catalyst theory  it was an order of the Court.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Aronov v. Chertoff,</i> No. 06-11526-NG, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40455, at *4-5 (Jan. 30, 2007) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p>Because the district court is in the best position to explain the meaning of its own order, we defer to its conclusion on the significance of the remand order. <i>See </i><i>Kinton,</i> 284 F.3d at 30 (\"Clearly, the district court is in the best position to determine whether its statements ... should be considered as the functional equivalent of a judicial order within the meaning of <i>Buckhannon.</i>\"); <i>Harvey v. Johanns,</i> 494 F.3d 237, 242 (1st Cir.2007) (\"We must, of course, accord deference to the district court's interpretation of the wording of its own order.\"); <i>see also </i><i>Lefkowitz v. Fair,</i> 816 F.2d 17, 22 (1st Cir.1987) (\"[U]ncertainty as to the meaning and intendment of a district court order can sometimes best be dispelled by deference to the views of the writing judge.\").</p>\n<p>Moreover, based on our assessment of the remand order and the circumstances of its issuance, we see no reason to question the district court's assessment of its own work. After Aronov filed suit in the district court under the statute, USCIS lost jurisdiction to adjudicate Aronov's application, thereby precluding it from entering a binding legal agreement with Aronov regarding his application. 8 U.S.C. § 1447(b) (\"Such court has jurisdiction over the matter and may either determine the matter or remand the matter, with appropriate instructions, to the [USCIS] to determine the matter.\"); <i>see </i><i>Etape v. Chertoff,</i> 497 F.3d 379, 384-85 (4th Cir. 2007).<sup>[6]</sup> The parties acknowledged as much in their joint motion for remand to the district court, which highlights the terms of 8 U.S.C. § 1447(b). Therefore, despite the agency's concession to allow Aronov's naturalization, it did not have the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*39</span> authority to effectuate that outcome until the district court returned jurisdiction to the agency. The court's order was indispensable to the naturalization outcome.</p>\n<p>The court's remand order also ended the dispute by providing Aronov his sought-after relief. To be sure, the district court relied on the government's statements in the joint motion for remand that naturalization was appropriate. However, because of the jurisdictional element, the district court could reasonably conclude that it was ultimately the remand order, not the agency's concession, that brought about the material change in the parties' relationship and \"place[d] the weight of judicial authority\" on the agreed-upon alteration in Aronov's legal status, <i>see </i><i>Smith,</i> 401 F.3d at 26.</p>\n<p>There remains the question of the form of the court's order. If the district court had entered an order explicitly setting forth the agreement of the parties as set forth in the joint motion for remand, its order would unquestionably be a consent decree. <i>See </i><i>Frew v. Hawkins,</i> 540 U.S. 431, 437, 124 S.Ct. 899, 157 L.Ed.2d 855 (2004) (\"A consent decree `embodies an agreement of the parties' and is also `an agreement that the parties desire and expect will be reflected in, and be enforceable as, a judicial decree that is subject to the rules generally applicable to other judgments and decrees.'\" (quoting <i>Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail,</i> 502 U.S. 367, 378, 112 S.Ct. 748, 116 L.Ed.2d 867 (1992))); <i>see also Black's Law Dictionary</i> (8th ed.2004) (defining a \"consent decree\" as \"[a] court decree that all parties agree to\"). Yet the district court's brief remand order here, which incorporated the terms of the joint motion by reference, had the same import and effect. <i>See </i><i>Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am.,</i> 511 U.S. 375, 381, 114 S.Ct. 1673, 128 L.Ed.2d 391 (1994) (indicating that a court would maintain jurisdiction to enforce a settlement agreement \"if the parties' obligation to comply with [its] terms ... had been made part of the order of dismissal  either by separate provision ... or by incorporating the terms of the settlement agreement in the order. In that event, a breach of the agreement would be a violation of the order, and ancillary jurisdiction to enforce the agreement would therefore exist.\"). Hence the brief remand order was the functional equivalent of a consent decree. If the government had failed to comply with the terms of the remand order, Aronov could have sought enforcement of the order through a contempt proceeding, as the district court noted. He would not have had to file a separate contract action against the agency or another suit under § 1447(b).<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*40</span> There is ample authority for the proposition that the functional equivalent of a consent decree satisfies the requirements of <i>Buckhannon.</i><sup>[8]</sup> Like our sister circuits, we do not read <i>Buckhannon</i> so narrowly as to preclude all forms of judicial relief other than a judgment on the merits or a court order in the form of a consent decree, or one explicitly labeled as such, from satisfying the judicial imprimatur requirement.<sup>[9]</sup> Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that its remand order issued pursuant to § 1447(b) incorporated the terms of the parties' joint motion and hence was the functional equivalent of a court-ordered consent decree.<sup>[10]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*41</span> Accordingly, the order constituted the necessary \"judicial imprimatur\" on the parties' change in legal relationship, qualifying Aronov as a prevailing party.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Substantial Justification</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Framework for Review</h2>\n<p>The government bears the burden of demonstrating that its position was substantially justified. <i>Schock,</i> 254 F.3d at 5. The Supreme Court has interpreted the \"substantially justified\" language in the EAJA to require reasonableness: \"[A]s between the two commonly used connotations of the word `substantially,' the one most naturally conveyed by the phrase before us here is not `justified to a high degree,' but rather `justified in substance or in the main'  that is, justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person.\" <i>Pierce,</i> 487 U.S. at 565, 108 S.Ct. 2541; <i>see also, e.g., </i><i>Schock,</i> 254 F.3d at 5; <i>Dantran, Inc. v. U.S. Dep't of Labor,</i> 246 F.3d 36, 40-41 (1st Cir.2001). Thus, the key question is whether the government's position has \"a reasonable basis in law and fact.\" <i>Pierce,</i> 487 U.S. at 566 n. 2, 108 S.Ct. 2541.</p>\n<p>As a matter of law, the government's position is substantially justified when the government's actions are required by a statute or law. <i>See </i><i>Dantran,</i> 246 F.3d at 41; <i>United States v. One Parcel of Real Prop.,</i> 960 F.2d 200, 208-09 (1st Cir.1992); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. B &amp; M Used Cars,</i> 860 F.2d 121, 124 (4th Cir.1988) (\"Whether the government's decision ... was reasonable must be examined in light of ... the appropriate statute.\"). Additionally, the government's position may be substantially justified even if its reasonable interpretation of its legal obligations is not ultimately affirmed by a court. <i>Schock,</i> 254 F.3d at 5. The district court having concluded that the government's litigation position was substantially justified, we review only the government's pre-litigation position. 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(2)(D); <i>Schock,</i> 254 F.3d at 5.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. The District Court's Decision</h2>\n<p>In focusing on the government's pre-litigation position, the court noted that more than a year and a half had passed between Aronov's citizenship exam and the filing of his action  an amount of time that exceeded by a multiple of four the statutory period that was a prerequisite for filing an action under 8 U.S.C. § 1447(b). The court viewed this delay as unjustified because the government had procedures in place for expediting an FBI name check application, including issuance of a writ of mandamus. The court concluded that \"[i]t is not `substantially justified' for the government to force naturalization applicants to incur additional expense  and the courts to be burdened  just to have naturalization applications processed in the timely manner already supposedly guaranteed by statute.\" It rejected the government's argument that it was unable to act on Aronov's application sooner because the FBI did not complete its background check until September 2006.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. The Government's Position</h2>\n<p>The government claims that two statutes justify its actions and inactions on Aronov's application. First, it cites 8 U.S.C. § 1446(a), which provides that \"[b]efore a person may be naturalized, an employee of the [USCIS], or of the United States designated by the Attorney General, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*42</span> shall conduct a personal investigation of the person applying for naturalization.\" It asserts that because the personal investigation of Aronov required by the statute had not been completed before he filed suit, USCIS could not legally grant him citizenship. Second, the government cites language included by Congress in the 1998 Appropriations Act, which has continuing effect: \"During fiscal year 1998 and each fiscal year thereafter, none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available to [USCIS] shall be used to complete adjudication of an application for naturalization unless [USCIS] has received confirmation from the Federal Bureau of Investigation that a <i>full criminal background check</i> has been completed....\" Depts. of Commerce, Justice &amp; State, The Judiciary &amp; Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 1998, Pub.L. 105-119, Stat. XXXX-XXXX-XX (1997) (8 U.S.C. § 1446 note) (emphasis added). It asserts that this language prevented USCIS from taking final action on Aronov's application before the FBI finished its background check in September 2006, after Aronov had filed suit.</p>\n<p>In response, Aronov argues that neither the language of 8 U.S.C. § 1446(a) nor the 1998 Appropriations Act requires the USCIS to undertake the comprehensive FBI name check, which the government concedes has been the primary cause of the delay in Aronov's proceeding. Further, he notes that the agency policy calling for such name checks has not been codified in any regulation. Finally, he cites a report from the USCIS's ombudsman that raised questions about the wisdom of the USCIS policy to require such searches, particularly in light of the significant backlog of applicants waiting for their FBI name checks to be completed.</p>\n<p>Before addressing the parties' arguments, we briefly discuss the FBI name check process and the USCIS's use of that process for adjudicating naturalization applications.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. The FBI's National Name Check Program</h2>\n<p>The FBI's National Name Check Program (\"NNCP\") was established during the Eisenhower Administration by Executive Order 10450. The NNCP reviews information in the FBI's files to determine whether an individual has been the subject of, or mentioned in, any FBI investigations. NNCP provides this information to dozens of federal, state, and foreign agencies \"seeking background information from FBI files on individuals before bestowing a privilege  [w]hether that privilege is government employment or an appointment; a Green card or naturalization; admission to the bar; or a visa for the privilege of visiting our homeland.\" <i>Foreign Travel to the United States: Testimony Before the H. Comm. on Gov. Reform</i> (July 10, 2003) (statement of Robert J. Garrity, Jr., Assistant Dir., Records Mgmt. Div., Fed. Bureau of Investigation), <i>available at</i> 2003 WL 21608243 (hereinafter <i>Garrity</i>). The NNCP also \"conducts numerous name searches in direct support of the counterintelligence, counterterrorism, and homeland security efforts of the FBI.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The USCIS commissions the FBI on a fee-for-service basis to provide the name checks, in accordance with USCIS-defined standards. USCIS Ombudsman, <i>Annual Report to Congress June 2007,</i> at 38, <i>available at</i> http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/ CISOMB_Annual&amp;Ruml;eport_2007.pdf. The scope of these standards has expanded over time. Until late 2002, the FBI was required to search only its \"main\" files for possible links between the applicant and an individual who was previously the target of an FBI investigation. In late 2002, however, in response to heightened security concerns after the attacks on September <span class=\"star-pagination\">*43</span> 11, 2001, and an incident in which an individual who was a member of a terrorist group was awarded benefits, the USCIS revised its policy and began requiring more comprehensive FBI name checks. These checks entailed a search of the FBI's \"reference\" files in addition to its main investigation files. United States Dep't of Homeland Security, Office of Inspector General, <i>A Review of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services' Alien Security Checks</i> 24 n. 30 (Nov.2005), <i>available at</i> www.dhs.gov/xoig/assets/ mgmtrpts/OIG_06-06_Nov05.pdf; <i>see also</i> Spencer S. Hsu and N.C. Aizenman, <i>FBI Name Check Cited in Naturalization Delays,</i> Wash. Post, June 17, 2007, at A1. Additionally, USCIS resubmitted 2.4 million applicant names to the FBI for these expanded checks. As currently undertaken, the FBI name check process entails the following:</p>\n<blockquote>The name is electronically checked against the FBI Universal Indices (UNI). The searches seek all instances of the individual's name and close date of birth, whether a main file name or reference.... The names are searched in a multitude of combinations, switching the order of first, last, middle names, as well as combinations with just the first and last, first and middle, and so on. It also searches different phonetic spelling variations of the names....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>If there is a match with a name in a FBI record, it is designated as a `Hit,' meaning that the system has stopped on a possible match with the name being checked, but now a human being must review the file or indices entry to further refine the names \"Hit\" on....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Approximately 85% of name checks are electronically returned as having \"No Record\" within 72 hours.... A secondary manual name search usually identifies an additional 10% of the requests as having a \"No Record\" .... The remaining 5% are identified as possibly being the subject of an FBI record. The FBI record must now be retrieved and reviewed. If the records were electronically uploaded into the FBI Automated Case Support (ACS) electronic recordkeeping system, it can be viewed quickly. If not, the relevant information must be retrieved from the existing paper record.</blockquote>\n<p>Garrity, <i>supra.</i></p>\n<p>Before September 11, 2001, the FBI received approximately 2.5 million name check requests per year. After the USCIS revised its policy in 2002, that number increased. <i>Id.</i> For example, in the FBI's fiscal year 2003 alone, it received over 6 million name check requests. Federal Bureau of Investigation, <i>National Name Check Program,</i> http://www.fbi.gov/ hq/nationalnamecheck.htm (last visited June 27, 2008). USCIS currently processes approximately 1.5 million applications requiring name checks annually, including applications both for green cards and for citizenship, and 99% of these are cleared by the FBI in less than six months. Julia Preston, <i>Rules Eased to Expedite Green Card Applications,</i> N.Y. Times, Feb. 12, 2008, at A12. Other applications, however, take longer; approximately 140,000 USCIS applications have been held up in the FBI's name check system for six months or longer. Spencer S. Hsu, <i>U.S. To Skirt Green-Card Check,</i> Wash. Post, Feb. 12, 2008, at A3. As of May 2007, of the about 329,000 cases pending before USCIS, \"64% were stalled [with the agency] for more than 90 days, 32% for more than one year and 17% for more than two years.\" Hsu and Aizenman, <i>supra,</i> at A1.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*44</span> The FBI name check is one piece of the larger background check that the USCIS commissions for all naturalization applicants. In addition to the FBI name check, the agency conducts a name check in the Interagency Border Inspection System (IBIS), \"a multiagency effort with a central system that combines information from multiple agencies, databases and system interfaces to compile data relating to national security risks, public safety issues and other law enforcement concerns.\" Fact Sheet, USCIS Press Office, <i>Immigration Security Checks-How and Why the Process Works</i> 2 (April 25, 2006), <i>available at</i> http://www.uscis.gov/files/ pressrelease/security_checks_42506.pdf. Results of an IBIS check are typically available immediately. <i>Id.</i> The FBI also obtains an applicant's fingerprints in order to search the existing criminal databases for records of arrests and criminal convictions. The FBI typically forwards a response on the fingerprint check to USCIS within 24 to 48 hours. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. Statutory Requirements</h2>\n<p>There is nothing in the language of 8 U.S.C. 1446(a) or the 1998 Appropriations Act that requires USCIS to include the NNCP in the naturalization process. Neither provision cited by the government states explicitly that an FBI name check is required, let alone a name check that includes an evaluation of all FBI reference files in addition to the main files. Section 1446(a) requires only that a \"<i>personal investigation</i>\" be conducted prior to allowing an individual to be naturalized, while the 1998 appropriations bill limits funds to the USCIS to complete adjudication of a naturalization application until the agency has received FBI confirmation that a \"<i>full criminal background check</i>\" has been completed. There is no specification in the bill beyond this phrase. It is entirely plausible  indeed likely  that the language used by Congress in the 1998 appropriations bill referred to the FBI's criminal history check, which is an established, preliminary step taken in the naturalization process, rather than the FBI name check.</p>\n<p>Importantly, the FBI name check program had already been in place for decades at the time the statutes relied upon by the government were enacted. If Congress intended to mandate that the USCIS commission FBI name checks before granting naturalization applications, it could have explicitly referenced such checks. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Cabrera,</i> 208 F.3d 309, 314 (1st Cir.2000) (examining Congress's other textual options in interpreting the statutory language at issue). Other than an unpersuasive reliance on the text of the statutes, the government has not identified any evidence that Congress intended to require the FBI name checks.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*45</span> Indeed, USCIS did not even begin requiring the full, comprehensive FBI name checks until 2002, years after passage of the applicable statutes. That fact confirms that the comprehensive name checks were a result of a policy change within the agency after the September 11, 2001 attacks rather than a congressional mandate.<sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p>In sum, the statutes cited by the government did not require USCIS to commission FBI name checks  let alone comprehensive ones  before adjudicating a naturalization application. Therefore, the \"mandated by statute\" rationale fails as a substantial justification for the agency's delays in adjudicating Aronov's application.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>c. The Application of <i>Chevron</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Perhaps realizing the flaws in its statutory argument, the government offers an alternative basis for finding that its pre-litigation position on Aronov's naturalization application was substantially justified. Relying on <i>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 842-45, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), the government asserts that we must defer to the USCIS's decisions regarding the scope of the \"personal investigation\" and \"full criminal background check\" of an applicant for naturalization because Congress, pursuant to the statutes discussed above, has committed to the agency the decision-making authority on these issues. The government argues that the agency, having concluded that the comprehensive FBI name checks are \"essential\" to the background investigations, was substantially justified in awaiting completion of Aronov's background check before adjudicating his naturalization application. Acknowledging that a small percentage of name checks take a considerable amount of time to complete, the agency asserts implicitly that those isolated delays, which are the fault of the FBI and not USCIS, should not prevent the government from maintaining the name check requirement as its policy and applying to it Aronov's naturalization application. That is, the agency argues that its general policy of requiring the name checks excuses the delays associated with individual naturalization applications, such as Aronov's.</p>\n<p>Even if the government is entitled to invoke <i>Chevron</i> to defend its general policy <span class=\"star-pagination\">*46</span> on the FBI name check process, <i>see, e.g.,</i> Cass Sunstein, <i>Chevron Step Zero,</i> 92 Va. L.Rev. 187 (2006) (analyzing the standards for determining whether an agency interpretation is entitled to evaluation under the <i>Chevron</i> framework), deference to its general policies does not require us to find substantial justification in this particular instance.<sup>[14]</sup> The government's eighteen-month delay in acting on Aronov's naturalization application directly contravened § 1447(b), which gives a district court jurisdiction to evaluate a naturalization application if the agency has failed to adjudicate the application within 120 days after conducting its initial examination. <i>See </i><i>Etape,</i> 497 F.3d at 385; <i>see also </i><i>Hovsepian,</i> 359 F.3d at 1163 (\"A central purpose of [§ 1447(b)] was to reduce the waiting time for naturalization applicants.\" (citing H.R.Rep. No. 101-187, at 8 (1989); 135 Cong. Rec. H4539-02, H4542 (1989) (statement of Rep. Morrison))) Both the courts and the agency itself have interpreted § 1447(b) as imposing a 120-day deadline for agency action. <i>See </i><i>Hovsepian,</i> 359 F.3d at 1161; 8 C.F.R. § 335.3(a) (\"A decision to grant or deny the application <i>shall be made</i> at the time of the initial examination or within 120-days after the date of the initial examination of the applicant for naturalization ....\") (emphasis added); <i>see also </i><i>Walji v. Gonzales,</i> 500 F.3d 432, 439 (5th Cir.2007) (\"[B]ecause the clear intent of Congress was to accelerate naturalization applications, and the statutory and regulatory language gives a definite time frame for decision once an examination has occurred, [§ 1447] is violated in situations [where the 120-day period is not complied with].\").</p>\n<p>In addition to § 1447(b)'s specific command,<sup>[15]</sup> the Administrative Procedures Act (\"APA\"), 5 U.S.C. § 555(b), offers a more general directive to agencies to resolve matters presented to it within a reasonable amount of time. <i>See</i> 5 U.S.C. § 555(b) (\"With due regard for the convenience and necessity of the parties or their representatives and within a reasonable time, each agency shall proceed to conclude a matter presented to it.\"). Our assessment of what is reasonable is informed by the relevant statutes and regulations. <i>See </i><i>Towns of Wellesley, Concord and Norwood, Mass. v. FERC,</i> 829 F.2d 275, 277 (1st Cir.1987) (discussing the guidelines, including the existence of a \"rule of reason,\" which govern the time an agency may take to make a decision) (citing <i>Telecomms. Research &amp; Action Ctr. v. FCC,</i> 750 F.2d 70 (D.C.Cir. 1984)); <i>Caswell v. Califano,</i> 583 F.2d 9, 16 (1st Cir.1978) (indicating that courts may look to statutory text to provide a reasonable time limit on agency action). Here, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*47</span> § 1447(b) and 8 C.F.R. § 335.3(a)<sup>[16]</sup> provide such guidance. <i>See </i><i>Sze v. INS,</i> No. C-97-0569 SC, 1997 WL 446236, at *7 (N.D.Cal. July 24, 1997) (\"[T]he 120-day rule provides the court with a measure of what constitutes a reasonable period for INS to process naturalization applications.\").</p>\n<p>Without foreclosing the possibility that the government could provide substantial justification grounded in the facts of a particular case for not complying with the 120-day statutory requirement, the government has advanced no such particularized justification here. Instead, the agency has offered only general justifications for the delay, including the agency's policy of requiring name checks for security purposes and the significant backlog of names that the FBI is processing. These explanations, however, do not justify the agency's disregard of the clear statutory mandate. As a district court deciding this exact issue has aptly stated:</p>\n<blockquote>But while a reasonable person would not dispute the necessity of conducting a background check on an applicant for naturalization, a reasonable person would require a satisfactory justification for a substantial delay in completing the background check. Indeed, government agencies are required to conclude matters presented to them within a \"reasonable time.\" <i>See</i> 5 U.S.C. § 555(b). Otherwise, an applicant for naturalization remains in perpetual limbo and is by de facto, denied his citizenship, a right that has been afforded by Congress to deserving individuals since the rise of the American democracy. This is particularly true when Congress has enacted legislation permitting the applicant to apply to federal district court if a decision is not rendered on the application within 120 days of the completion of the examination under 8 U.S.C. § 1447(b). Here, Defendants offer no justification for the delay; rather, they merely state that \"background checks were necessary and had to be completed before the plaintiff could be naturalized.\" This explanation merely restates, in a conclusory manner, the necessity of completing the background check; it does not justify the delay.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Alghamdi v. Ridge,</i> No. 3:05cv344-RS, 2006 WL 5670940, at *14 (N.D.Fla. Sept.25, 2006). Although we also acknowledge that the agency has valid  indeed persuasive  reasons for requiring comprehensive FBI name checks under ordinary circumstances, that policy determination cannot justify the failure to comply with a statutory deadline. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Rotinsulu v. Mukasey,</i> 515 F.3d 68, 72 (1st Cir.2008) (\"An agency has an obligation to abide by its own regulations.\").</p>\n<p>Indeed, despite the agency's assertions that the FBI backlog was a significant cause of the delays in this case, the ultimate cause of the agency's failure to comply with the law was its own non-compliance with its regulations.<sup>[17]</sup> If the agency had properly deferred conducting its initial interview of Aronov until the FBI name check process had been completed, the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*48</span> statutory obligation would not have arisen.<sup>[18]</sup> In its brief, the government has neither explained nor justified its non-compliance with 8 C.F.R. § 335.2(b) in connection with Aronov's application or that of any other naturalization applicant.<sup>[19]</sup></p>\n<p>Therefore, the government's assertion that it was required to wait until Aronov's FBI name check was completed before finally adjudicating his naturalization application does not have \"a reasonable basis in law and fact.\" <i>Pierce,</i> 487 U.S. at 566 n. 2, 108 S.Ct. 2541. Indeed, the government's attempt to invoke an administrative policy to trump an explicit statutory command turns <i>Chevron</i> deference on its head. <i>See </i><i>Stinson v. United States,</i> 508 U.S. 36, 44, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993) (\"Under <i>Chevron,</i> if a statute is unambiguous the statute governs.\"). In light of the 120-day statutory directive, the agency's long delay (over four times the statutory period), and the absence of any evidence that the government tried to expedite Aronov's application to comply with the statute, the government's conduct toward Aronov can only be classified as unreasonable and not substantially justified. <i>See </i><i>Russell v. Nat'l Mediation Bd.,</i> 775 F.2d 1284, 1290 (5th Cir.1985) (concluding that the government's position was not substantially justified because it breached a clear statutory mandate). Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that the government's pre-litigation conduct was not substantially justified.<sup>[20]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's order granting Aronov's application for attorney's fees and expenses under 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A). Additionally, we remand the matter to the district court so that the fee award may be recalculated to reflect the fees and expenses associated with this appeal.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<p>LYNCH, Chief Judge, dissenting.</p>\n<p>With respect, I dissent. Because the award rests on errors of law, I would reverse.</p>\n<p>The Equal Access to Justice Act (\"EAJA\"), 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(a), must be construed in favor of the United States. <i>Ardestani v. INS,</i> 502 U.S. 129, 137, 112 S.Ct. 515, 116 L.Ed.2d 496 (1991). The Act requires a court to award fees and expenses to a prevailing party in a civil <span class=\"star-pagination\">*49</span> action against the United States unless the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified, or that special circumstances make an award unjust. 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(a). The purpose of the Act was to \"ensure that certain individuals ... will not be deterred from seeking review of, or defending against, unjustified governmental action because of the expense involved.... The Act reduces the disparity in resources between individuals... and the federal government.\" H.R. Rep. 99-120(I), at 4 (1985), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 132, 132-33; <i>see also </i><i>Scarborough v. Principi,</i> 541 U.S. 401, 407, 124 S.Ct. 1856, 158 L.Ed.2d 674 (2004).<sup>[21]</sup></p>\n<p>I disagree with the majority's reasoning on both prongs of the EAJA analysis. This result contravenes the purposes of the Act. It imposes on United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\") the costs of plaintiff's attorneys' fees when the agency at all times acted in accordance with the law. It also imposes such costs on the agency for attempting to resolve the matter by agreement and withdrawing the issue from the court and back to the agency so that the agency could give the relief the plaintiff sought. It also has the practical effect of draining resources from an agency which is already struggling to do its job.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>In my view, plaintiff is not a prevailing party. A party is prevailing for EAJA purposes if there is a material alteration in the party's position that bears a \"judicial imprimatur.\" <i>Buckhannon Bd. &amp; Care Home, Inc. v. W. Va. Dep't of Health &amp; Human Res.,</i> 532 U.S. 598, 604-05, 121 S.Ct. 1835, 149 L.Ed.2d 855 (2001). In <i>Buckhannon,</i> the Supreme Court noted two specific ways in which a party can prevail: by obtaining a judgment on the merits or a consent decree in its favor. <i>Id.</i> at 605, 121 S.Ct. 1835. Other circuits have read <i>Buckhannon</i> as allowing parties to prevail if they receive the equivalent of a consent decree or some other form of judicial relief that both affects a material alteration and bears a judicial imprimatur. <i>See </i><i>Smith v. Fitchburg Pub. Sch.,</i> 401 F.3d 16, 23-24 (1st Cir.2005). This circuit has not taken a position on the issue. <i>Id.</i> at 23.</p>\n<p>The majority focuses on the first situation, asking \"whether the district court's order was the functional equivalent of a consent decree.\" The majority distinguishes this circuit's decision in <i>Smith</i> on the ground that <i>Smith</i> was not concerned with whether the orders in question were the equivalent of a consent decree. However, as in <i>Smith,</i> here the question of whether the order was the equivalent of a consent decree was not raised by either party, nor was that the theory on which the district court relied. Thus the issue was waived. <i>Id.</i> at 24 (the issue is waived if not presented by the parties). Instead, the parties and district court focused on the second situation: whether the district court's order put the necessary judicial imprimatur on the change in Aronov's legal status. The majority should not create arguments the parties and the district court did not use, nor do so to justify its result.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*50</span> But even if the issue had not been waived, the district court's brief order remanding the case is not the equivalent of a consent decree. The order contains no statement incorporating an agreement between the parties or requiring that either party act in a particular way. All the order does is to remand the case at the request of the agency. The order here thus differs from the ones cited by the majority which other circuits have found to be the functional equivalent of consent decrees. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Carbonell v. INS,</i> 429 F.3d 894, 897 (9th Cir.2005) (district court incorporated parties' stipulation into an order); <i>Truesdell v. Phila. Hous. Auth.,</i> 290 F.3d 159, 162 (3d Cir.2002) (district court order included detailed terms of parties' settlement); <i>Am. Disability Ass'n v. Chmielarz,</i> 289 F.3d 1315, 1317 (11th Cir. 2002) (parties' settlement was \"approved, adopted, and ratified\" by the district court in an order where the court expressly retained jurisdiction).</p>\n<p>As the Supreme Court has made clear, the distinction is material: \"The situation would be quite different if the parties' obligation to comply with the terms of the settlement agreement had been made part of the order....\" <i>Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am.,</i> 511 U.S. 375, 381, 114 S.Ct. 1673, 128 L.Ed.2d 391 (1994). It is quite clear that a \"judge's mere awareness and approval of the terms of the settlement agreement do not suffice to make them part of his order.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>I would hold that the district court's order lacks the necessary judicial imprimatur to entitle Aronov to prevailing party status. Our circuit precedent in <i>Smith</i> requires that result. The majority's treatment of the order as the functional equivalent of a consent decree is inconsistent with our holding in <i>Smith.</i><sup>[22]</sup> That case involved an administrative hearing officer's pre-hearing orders, some of which were accompanied by the threat of sanctions, which \"memorialized the voluntary concessions made by [defendant] and attempted to keep the settlement process moving forward in a timely manner.\" <i>Smith,</i> 401 F.3d at 26. We held that these orders, although they imposed specific requirements on defendant, did not have sufficient judicial imprimatur to make plaintiff a prevailing party because they simply made defendant \"follow through with what [defendant] had already voluntarily promised to do.\" <i>Id.</i> at 27. That is exactly the case here. The district court's remand permitted USCIS to follow through with its announced intention to make Aronov a citizen by November 8, 2006. USCIS had voluntarily agreed to do so before it requested the remand. As in <i>Smith,</i> the remand may have kept the process moving in a timely manner, but that is not enough to make Aronov a prevailing party. His claim under the EAJA should have stopped there.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>I also disagree with the majority that the government's pre-litigation position was not substantially justified.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has interpreted the \"substantially justified\" language in the EAJA: \"[A]s between the two commonly used connotations of the word `substantially,' the one most naturally conveyed by the phrase before us here is not `justified to a high degree,' but rather `justified in substance or in the main'  that is, justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person.\" <i>Pierce v. Underwood,</i> 487 U.S. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*51</span> 552, 565, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988); <i>see also, e.g., </i><i>Schock v. United States,</i> 254 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2001); <i>Dantran, Inc. v. U.S. Dep't of Labor,</i> 246 F.3d 36, 40-41 (1st Cir.2001). The government's position is substantially justified if required by law. <i>See </i><i>Dantran,</i> 246 F.3d at 41; <i>United States v. One Parcel of Real Prop. With Bldgs.,</i> 960 F.2d 200, 208-09 (1st Cir.1992). That was true here.</p>\n<p>The government's position may be substantially justified even if its reasonable interpretation of its legal obligations is not ultimately affirmed by a court. <i>Schock,</i> 254 F.3d at 5. This court earlier reversed a district court for abuse of discretion in granting attorneys' fees when the government \"was at least reasonable\" in denying a visa because it wanted to \"communicate the attitude of the United States government toward the activities of the Soviet Union,\" even though the visa applicant's interpretation of the underlying law ultimately prevailed. <i>Allende v. Baker,</i> 891 F.2d 7, 12, 13 (1st Cir.1989); <i>see also, e.g., </i><i>Li v. Keisler,</i> 505 F.3d 913, 920 (9th Cir. 2007) (\"In the absence of guidance from this court, the government's position was substantially justified.\"); <i>Bricks, Inc. v. U.S. EPA,</i> 426 F.3d 918, 924 (7th Cir.2005) (although EPA was unsuccessful in its attempt to show a hydrological connection, it was still substantially justified in doing so).</p>\n<p>Here, the government argues that USCIS's pre-litigation position was substantially justified because that position was taken pursuant to federal law. In particular, the government points to two congressional enactments with which it has complied here. The first is 8 U.S.C. § 1446(a), which provides that \"[b]efore a person may be naturalized, an employee of the [USCIS], or of the United States designated by the Attorney General, shall conduct a personal investigation of the person applying for naturalization.\" The second is language included by Congress in the 1998 Appropriations Act which has continuing effect: \"[D]uring fiscal year 1998 and each fiscal year thereafter, none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available to [USCIS] shall be used to complete adjudication of an application for naturalization unless [USCIS] has received confirmation from the Federal Bureau of Investigation that a <i>full criminal background check</i> has been completed....\" Dep'ts of Commerce, Justice &amp; State, The Judiciary &amp; Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1998, Pub.L. 105-119, 111 Stat. 2440, 2448-49 (1997) (8 U.S.C. § 1446 note) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>The majority faults USCIS for interpreting the phrase \"full criminal background check\" to include a FBI name check. In the end, the award here turns on the majority's view that USCIS did not need to include the FBI name check as part of a \"full\" check, and that the agency's compliance with its name check policy renders its pre-litigation position here (to await the results of a requested name check) not substantially justified. But the agency's policy and its pre-litigation decision to comply with its policy were entirely reasonable.</p>\n<p>The question before us is not whether the language in 8 U.S.C. § 1446 and the 1998 Appropriations Act specifically requires that FBI name checks be part of the background check on citizenship applicants, but whether the agency's interpretation of these statutes as requiring FBI name checks to fulfill its statutory responsibilities renders its position not substantially justified. The position is substantially justified because it was a reasonable interpretation of a legislative command<sup>[23]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*52</span> and that interpretation was committed to the agency's expertise.</p>\n<p>Principles of administrative law require that courts defer to reasonable interpretations by agencies of matters committed to the agency's expertise by Congress. <i>Chevron U.S.A. v. Natural Res. Def. Council,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984); <i>Global Naps, Inc. v. Verizon New England, Inc.,</i> 505 F.3d 43, 47 (1st Cir.2007). Agencies are also entitled to deference with respect to policy determinations. <i>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe,</i> 401 U.S. 402, 416, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971); <i>Global Naps,</i> 505 F.3d at 47; <i>Associated Fisheries of Me., Inc. v. Daley,</i> 127 F.3d 104, 109 (1st Cir.1997) (\"[P]olicy choices are for the agency, not the court, to make. Even if a reviewing court disagrees with the agency's conclusions, it cannot substitute its judgment for that of the agency.\"). We also note that we are describing a consistent USCIS interpretation and practice, not one adopted for purposes of the issues in this attorneys' fees litigation.</p>\n<p>USCIS, not the majority, has the expertise to determine what should constitute a full criminal background check. The concern that applicants be adequately vetted before they become citizens has taken on added urgency in an age where terrorism is a reality and a continuing threat. That the agency came to decide in 2002 that the inclusion of FBI name checks provided better full criminal background investigations only undercuts the majority's position.</p>\n<p>The majority holds that although a court might ordinarily defer to USCIS's policy of using FBI name checks to fulfill its statutory mandate to complete background investigations on citizenship applicants, here we cannot do so because the agency contravened 8 U.S.C. § 1447(b). The statute permits a citizenship applicant to file suit in federal district court if USCIS fails to adjudicate his application within 120 days of conducting an initial examination. The majority places great weight on this provision, treating it as a \"statutory mandate\" that the agency must adjudicate an application within 120 days of an initial examination. That is plainly not what the statute says. It says only that suit may be brought within 120 days of the examination.</p>\n<p>The provision's legislative history discusses the importance of eliminating delays but says nothing about imposing a deadline on the agency, only that after 120 days relief can be sought in federal court. <i>See</i> 135 Cong. Rec. H4539-02, 4542-43, 1989 WL 182156 (daily ed. July 31, 1989). Thus the authorization to file suit in district court is meant to encourage the agency to act fast, but that does not mean that Congress meant to impose a strict deadline on the agency. Indeed, if Congress wanted to impose a strict deadline, it could have done so directly. It is true that the agency's regulations suggest that it treat the 120-day provision as an internal deadline, <i>see</i> 8 C.F.R. § 335.3(a), but that does not create a \"statutory mandate.\" The statute simply governs the timing of suits.<sup>[24]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*53</span> Corresponding with its view that 8 U.S.C. § 1447(b) creates a mandate, the majority suggests that the government would have to make a very strong showing in order to justify missing the 120-day mark. It also faults the government for not advancing a \"particularized justification\" regarding Aronov and why a name check was necessary for him. In my view both rationales are wrong on their own terms and both miss the point.</p>\n<p>Even reading the statute as imposing a deadline on the agency, the majority is nonetheless wrong because there is nothing to say that 8 U.S.C. § 1447(b) was meant to trump the agency's obligations to see that an applicant meets the requirements for citizenship or to trump the agency's mandate to conduct a full criminal background check.</p>\n<p>Here the agency made a mistake by conducting Aronov's initial examination before it had completed his background investigation, including obtaining the results from the FBI of his name check.<sup>[25]</sup> Bureaucracies make mistakes. Given this mistake, the relevant question is whether it was unreasonable for the agency to proceed with the name check even though doing so meant that Aronov could pursue relief in federal court because of the 120-day provision.</p>\n<p>I would hold that it was not unreasonable for USCIS to miss the 120-day mark in order to complete a name check before granting Aronov citizenship. No \"particularized justification\" is necessary because the entire point of conducting name checks is that the government does not know what the check will uncover. As USCIS has stated,</p>\n<blockquote>Although these security checks may require a more lengthy processing time, USCIS believes that performing them is essential to identifying national security and public safety concerns that would not have been uncovered by other means. This is particularly true given that in[ ] a few cases, the information obtained from the FBI through this process has reflected very significant issues and risks. FBI name checks disclose information to USCIS that is otherwise not available.... USCIS is committed to effective background checks, and thus is committed to the FBI name check.</blockquote>\n<p>USCIS, <i>Response to the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman's 2006 Report,</i> at 10, <i>available at</i> http://www.dhs. gov/xlibrary/assets/USCIS-Response-Ombudsman-06-Report-May-2007.pdf.</p>\n<p>Moreover, as the majority points out, although USCIS recently eliminated the name check requirement for visa applicants in order to lessen its backlog, it has not done so for citizenship applicants for the very sensible reason that once a person is granted citizenship, that decision is not easily reversed. There is nothing unreasonable about USCIS's decision to postpone a decision on Aronov's application for citizenship until obtaining information about whether the name check revealed risks to national security or public safety, even if doing so meant that a decision could not be reached within 120 days of his examination.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*54</span> Indeed, the case law also provides no basis for the award here. USCIS's pre-litigation position in this case bears no resemblance to pre-litigation positions that courts have found not to be substantially justified. In <i>Healey v. Leavitt,</i> 485 F.3d 63 (2d Cir.2007), the Second Circuit held that the government's pre-litigation position was not substantially justified when the government \"failed to offer any justification for the Secretary's failure to require [home health agencies] to provide written notice of the termination of benefits.\" <i>Id.</i> at 67. Here the agency points to statutes forbidding it to grant citizenship before certain actions are taken. In <i>Sierra Club v. Secretary of Army,</i> 820 F.2d 513 (1st Cir.1987), this court held that an agency's refusal to prepare an environmental impact statement for a project was unreasonable when there was significant evidence that the project required one and several other federal agencies had advocated for one and warned that one might be legally required. <i>Id.</i> at 519-20 (citing <i>Sierra Club v. Marsh,</i> 769 F.2d 868, 874-75 (1st Cir. 1985)). Here, the agency did not act contrary to law, but according to its reasonable interpretation of the law.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>The majority opinion will, in my view, have a number of unfortunate consequences. The majority holds that the government, by acting reasonably and requesting a remand so that it could grant Aronov citizenship, exposed itself to liability under the EAJA because Aronov necessarily became a prevailing party once the court granted the remand. This will discourage USCIS from acting to resolve these cases in a similarly efficient and amicable way in the future. The majority also says that it would be very difficult for the government to show that it was substantially justified in missing the 120-day mark to act on a citizenship application. The majority would thus discourage USCIS from conducting investigations of applicants that could turn up important information but would require longer than 120 days after the applicant's examination for the agency to make a final determination. Ultimately the decision could be contrary to the interests of applicants because in the face of incomplete information, the agency might choose the safer course of denying citizenship.</p>\n<p>I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  8 U.S.C. § 1447(b) reads:\n</p>\n<p>If there is a failure to make a determination under section 1446 of this title [to grant or deny the naturalization application] before the end of the 120-day period after the date on which the examination is conducted ..., the applicant may apply to the United States district court for the district in which the applicant resides for a hearing on the matter. Such court has jurisdiction over the matter and may either determine the matter or remand the matter, with appropriate instructions, to the [USCIS] to determine the matter.</p>\n<p>[2]  The <i>\"3\"</i> references the previously submitted joint remand motion.</p>\n<p>[3]  <i>Black's Law Dictionary</i> defines \"imprimatur\" as \"a grant of approval; commendatory license or sanction.\" (8th ed.2004).</p>\n<p>[4]  Although the Supreme Court in <i>Buckhannon</i> interpreted the fee-shifting provisions of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (\"FHAA\"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601-3631, and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213, \"the principles underlying [its] holding [we]re broadly stated and [] not statute-specific.\" <i>Doe v. Boston Pub. Schs.,</i> 358 F.3d 20, 25 (1st Cir.2004). Accordingly, we have held that the Supreme Court's reasoning in \"<i>Buckhannon</i> is presumed to apply generally to all fee-shifting statutes that use the `prevailing party' terminology.\" <i>Smith v. Fitchburg Pub. Schs.,</i> 401 F.3d 16, 22 n. 8 (1st Cir.2005) (quoting <i>Doe,</i> 358 F.3d at 25). The parties do not dispute the applicability of <i>Buckhannon</i> in this case.</p>\n<p>[5]  We noted in <i>Smith</i> that this circuit had not \"squarely addressed whether judgments on the merits or consent decrees are the only forms of relief sufficient to confer prevailing party status, whether a functional equivalent of such relief may be adequate, or whether any other types of relief could satisfy <i>Buckhannon</i>'s requirements.\" <i>Smith,</i> 401 F.3d at 23; <i>see also </i><i>Doe,</i> 358 F.3d at 24 n. 4.</p>\n<p>[6]  The question of whether the court maintains exclusive jurisdiction or, alternatively, concurrent jurisdiction with the USCIS has been litigated in other courts. Most courts have held that the district court has exclusive jurisdiction over the application until it has acted pursuant to the statute. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Etape,</i> 497 F.3d at 384-85 (holding that § 1447(b) vests the district court with exclusive jurisdiction over a naturalization application); <i>United States v. Hovsepian,</i> 359 F.3d 1144, 1159 (9th Cir.2004) (en banc) (same). <i>But see, e.g., </i><i>Bustamante v. Chertoff,</i> 533 F.Supp.2d 373, 381 (S.D.N.Y.2008) (reaching the opposite conclusion). Here, the government does not assert that the USCIS maintained jurisdiction over Aronov's application after he filed suit in district court.</p>\n<p>[7]  This distinction has an analog in the private realm, where one party is seeking to enforce the terms of a settlement agreement against another private party. If the terms of the settlement agreement have not been incorporated into a court order, the federal courts will often lack jurisdiction to enforce its terms. In contrast, where the parties have obtained a consent decree or a court order that either incorporates the terms of the settlement agreement or explicitly retains jurisdiction, a federal court will possess \"enforcement\" or \"ancillary\" jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the order. <i>See </i><i>Kokkonen,</i> 511 U.S. at 381, 114 S.Ct. 1673; <i>Buckhannon,</i> 532 U.S. at 604 n. 7, 121 S.Ct. 1835 (\"<i>[F]ederal jurisdiction</i> to enforce a private contractual settlement will often be lacking <i>unless</i> the terms of the agreement are incorporated into the order of dismissal.\") (emphasis added); <i>see also </i><i>Fafel v. DiPaola,</i> 399 F.3d 403, 414 (1st Cir.2005) (recognizing that a federal court had ancillary jurisdiction to enforce its prior Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 68 judgment because the judgment, although limited in nature, \"necessarily incorporate[d] the terms of the underlying Rule 68 offer\" and the district court limited its exercise of ancillary jurisdiction to enforcing the terms of that prior judgment); <i>Martel v. Fridovich,</i> 14 F.3d 1, 3 n. 4 (1st Cir.1993) (per curiam) (\"The appropriate vehicle for enforcement of the consent decree is an action for contempt brought before the court responsible for the decree.\").</p>\n<p>[8]  <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Truesdell v. Phila. Hous. Auth.,</i> 290 F.3d 159, 165 (3d Cir.2002) (holding that a court order, characterized by the defendant as a stipulated settlement, was sufficient to support a finding of judicial imprimatur where the order contained mandatory language, included the judge's signature, and was judicially enforceable); <i>Smyth,</i> 282 F.3d at 281 (\"We doubt that the Supreme Court's guidance in <i>Buckhannon</i> was intended to be interpreted so restrictively as to require that the words `consent decree' be used explicitly.\"); <i>T.D. v. LaGrange Sch. Dist. No. 102,</i> 349 F.3d 469, 478 (7th Cir.2003) (\"[S]ome settlement agreements, even though not explicitly labeled as a `consent decree' may confer `prevailing party' status, if they are sufficiently analogous to a consent decree.\"); <i>Carbonell v. INS,</i> 429 F.3d 894, 901 (9th Cir.2005) (\"[W]hen a court incorporates the terms of a voluntary agreement into an order, that order is stamped with sufficient `judicial imprimatur' for the litigant to qualify as a prevailing party for the purpose of awarding attorney's fees.\"); <i>Am. Disability Ass'n, Inc. v. Chmielarz,</i> 289 F.3d 1315, 1320 (11th Cir.2002) (\"A formal consent decree is unnecessary ... because the explicit retention of jurisdiction or the court's order specifically approving the terms of the settlement are ... the functional equivalent of the entry of a consent decree.\"); <i>Davy v. CIA,</i> 456 F.3d 162, 166 (D.C.Cir.2006) (\"Where a settlement agreement is embodied in a court order such that the obligation to comply with its terms is court-ordered, the court's approval and the attendant judicial over-sight (in the form of continuing jurisdiction to enforce the agreement) may be equally apparent. We will assume, then, that an order containing an agreement reached by the parties may be functionally a consent decree for purposes of the inquiry to which <i>Buckhannon</i> directs us.\"); <i>see also </i><i>Bell v. Bd. of County Comm'rs. of Jefferson County,</i> 451 F.3d 1097, 1103 (10th Cir.2006) (\"Most circuits recognize that some settlement agreements, even though not explicitly labeled as a consent decree may confer prevailing party status, if they are sufficiently analogous to a consent decree.\") (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p>[9]  Although in <i>Smith</i> we noted that there was disagreement among our sister circuits on this question, citing the Eighth Circuit's decision in <i>Christina A. v. Bloomberg,</i> 315 F.3d 990 (8th Cir.2003), as an example of a court reading <i>Buckhannon</i> narrowly to preclude all other forms of relief, the Eighth Circuit has more recently repudiated our reading of its decision. <i>See </i><i>Smith,</i> 401 F.3d at 23. In <i>Northern Cheyenne Tribe v. Jackson,</i> 433 F.3d 1083, 1085 n. 2 (8th Cir.2006), the court asserted that its decision in <i>Christina A.</i> did not foreclose the possibility that other types of court-ordered relief could provide the requisite judicial imprimatur required by <i>Buckhannon.</i></p>\n<p>[10]  The dissent asserts that the issue of whether the district court's remand order was the equivalent of a consent decree was not raised by either party, nor was it the theory on which the district court relied, and therefore we should not analyze that issue in deciding the case. The district court did not use the phrase \"functional equivalent of a consent decree\" in its decision awarding attorney's fees and costs to Aronov. Nevertheless, in addressing the judicial imprimatur question in its decision, the district court described its order as incorporating the terms of the parties' joint motion for remand. It further stated that its order could be enforced through a contempt action. Hence the district court described its order in consent-decree terms. The government chose not to challenge this consent-decree aspect of the district court's decision. Instead, it advanced a largely irrelevant judicial imprimatur argument under our <i>Smith</i> decision that it deemed more favorable to its position. Aronov responded to the argument made by the government. He had no obligation to respond to an argument that the government did not make.</p>\n<p>[11]  To help alleviate this backlog, USCIS decided in February 2008 to give preliminary approval to green card applicants for whom an FBI fingerprint check and Interagency Border Inspection Services check have been successfully completed and an FBI name check request has been pending for over six months. If the eventual name check turns up negative information, the visa will be canceled and deportation proceedings commenced. Memorandum from Michael Aytes, Assoc. Dir., USCIS Domestic Operations, to USCIS Field Leadership 2 (Feb. 4, 2008), <i>available at</i> http://www.uscis.gov/files/ pressrelease/DOC017.pdf. This change does not apply to citizenship applicants because \"revoking naturalization is a much more difficult thing to do\" than revoking a green card. Hsu, <i>supra,</i> at A3 (quoting USCIS Spokesman Christopher S. Bentley).</p>\n<p>[12]  Although the government has not invoked it, a regulation relevant to interpreting the scope of the statutory provisions at issue does exist. In full, 8 C.F.R. § 335.2(b) reads:\n</p>\n<p>Completion of criminal background checks before examination. The Service will notify applicants for naturalization to appear before a Service officer for initial examination on the naturalization application only after the Service has received a definitive response from the Federal Bureau of Investigation that a full criminal background check of an applicant has been completed. A definitive response that a full criminal background check on an applicant has been completed includes:</p>\n<p>(1) Confirmation from the Federal Bureau of Investigation that an applicant does not have an administrative or a criminal record;</p>\n<p>(2) Confirmation from the Federal Bureau of Investigation that an applicant has an administrative or a criminal record; or</p>\n<p>(3) Confirmation from the Federal Bureau of Investigation that two properly prepared fingerprint cards (Form FD-258) have been determined unclassifiable for the purpose of conducting a criminal background check and have been rejected.</p>\n<p>The regulation does not assist the agency's claims because, like the statutes, it gives no indication that a \"full\" criminal background check includes an FBI name check.</p>\n<p>[13]  The USCIS's recent change of policy to grant thousands of green-card applicants permanent residency before their full FBI name checks are completed reinforces this view. Although the agency did not take the same step with respect to naturalization applications, it attributed the differential treatment to the difficulty of revising naturalization decisions, not to statutory requirements. Hsu, <i>supra,</i> at A3 (citing USCIS Spokesman Christopher S. Bentley). In so explaining the discrepancy, the agency implicitly acknowledged that it was not prohibited <i>by law</i> from extending the policy to naturalization decisions.</p>\n<p>[14]  Aronov argues on a number of grounds that the USCIS's name check policy is not entitled to <i>Chevron</i> deference. We need not reach that question because of our conclusion that even if the agency is entitled to <i>Chevron</i> deference for its policy requiring FBI name checks, this deference does not substantially justify the government's pre-litigation conduct in this particular instance.</p>\n<p>[15]  The dissent's treatment of the 120-day time frame established by 8 U.S.C. § 1447(b) is curious. Although the dissent acknowledges that the agency has adopted a regulation, 8 C.F.R. § 335.3(a), that treats the 120-day time frame as a deadline, the dissent treats the statutory and regulatory time frame as merely aspirational in nature, with no consequence for the agency if it fails to comply. If Congress had taken such a relaxed view of its 120-day time frame, it would not have explicitly provided that an applicant whose naturalization application remains unresolved at the end of the 120-day period may file suit in federal court to have the application either adjudicated by the court or remanded to the agency with instructions to adjudicate it. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Etape,</i> 497 F.3d at 384-85 (concluding that after an applicant has filed suit with the district court pursuant to § 1447(b), the court has exclusive jurisdiction over the application).</p>\n<p>[16]  8 C.F.R. § 335.3(a) states: \"A decision to grant or deny the [naturalization] application shall be made at the time of the initial examination or within 120-days after the date of the initial examination of the applicant for naturalization under § 335.2.\"</p>\n<p>[17]  Specifically, the agency failed to comply with 8 C.F.R. § 335.2(b). The regulation states: \"The Service will notify applicants for naturalization to appear before a Service officer for initial examination on the naturalization application only after the Service has received a definitive response from the Federal Bureau of Investigation that a full criminal background check of an applicant has been completed.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>[18]  We acknowledge the oddity that arises because of the agency's regulations. If USCIS had complied with its regulations and waited to interview Aronov until the FBI name check had been completed, his waiting time for the completion of the naturalization process might have been longer than it was here. However, this fact does not alter our legal analysis. Once USCIS gave Aronov his initial interview, it had to confront the clear timing obligation imposed by Congress.</p>\n<p>[19]  Based on a recent press release issued by USCIS on April 2, 2008, there appear to be approximately 29,800 applicants whose naturalization applications were submitted to the FBI before May 2006 and whose interviews have already been completed. The agency has requested that the FBI prioritize their name checks. This is one piece of a larger, joint plan between the agency and the FBI to eliminate the backlog of name checks. The FBI also announced its intention to have processed all name checks pending for more than three years by May of this year. <i>See</i> News Release, USCIS, <i>USCIS and FBI Release Joint Plan to Eliminate Backlog of FBI Name Checks</i> (Apr. 2, 2008), <i>available at</i> http://www. uscis.gov/files/article/NameCheck  2Apr08. pdf.</p>\n<p>[20]  We also conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that there are no \"special circumstances [that] make an award [of attorney's fees] unjust.\" <i>See </i><i>Schock,</i> 254 F.3d at 4 (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A)).</p>\n<p>[21]  <i>See also</i> 131 Cong. Rec. S9991-02, 1985 WL 715613 (daily ed. July 24, 1985) (statement of Sen. Grassley) (noting that the purpose of the Act was to prevent \"meritless\" government action); <i>id.</i> (statement of Sen. DeConcini) (\"Before the [EAJA], small businesses, faced with unjustified Federal agency actions, were confronted with a difficult choice  to comply without question to Government regulatory enforcement which they believed improper, or challenge the Government, often at a cost exceeding the fine or penalty imposed.\").</p>\n<p>[22]  The majority also suggests that <i>Smith</i> is somehow different because the orders in question came from an administrative hearing officer rather than a district court, but <i>Smith</i> lends no support to that proposition.</p>\n<p>[23]  The majority says that the government has presented no argument that Congress intended that USCIS use the FBI name check. That reasoning puts the cart before the horse. The broad language used by Congress lets the agency determine how best to perform a full criminal background check and does not limit the agency to a particular type of check. There is no evidence, textual or otherwise, that Congress intended to require the agency not to use FBI name checks.</p>\n<p>[24]  Additionally, the cases the majority cites for the proposition that the statute creates a deadline involved different questions. <i>United States v. Hovsepian,</i> 359 F.3d 1144 (9th Cir. 2004), was concerned with the question of whether exclusive jurisdiction rests in the district court after 120 days, and it provided no analysis or support for its observation that § 1447(b) \"requires the INS to make a decision... within 120 days.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1161. <i>Walji v. Gonzales,</i> 500 F.3d 432 (5th Cir.2007), involved the question of when the 120-day period begins to run and used the language \"the statute is violated in situations such as [petitioner's]\" in the context of supporting its conclusion that the 120-day period applies from the time the examination, and not the entire background check, is completed. <i>Id.</i> at 439.</p>\n<p>[25]  There is no question that doing so was an error. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. § 335.2(b).</p>\n\n</div>",

The act provides that a court shall award fees and expenses to a prevailing party in a civil action against the United States unless the court finds that the position of the government was substantially justified or that other circumstances make an award unjust.</p>\n<p>Aronov filed the action in this case to force the government to act on his long-pending application for naturalization. The district court awarded him attorney's fees under the EAJA on the grounds that he was the prevailing party in the litigation and that the pre-litigation position taken by the government was not substantially justified. We affirm the district court's award.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>A native of Russia and a permanent resident of the United States since 2001, Aronov applied for naturalization with the Vermont Service Center of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\") on May 22, 2004. After initial processing and completion of the required fingerprint check, Aronov's case was forward to the Boston USCIS office. Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1446(b) and 8 C.F.R. § 335.2(a), Aronov was interviewed on February 14, 2005 regarding his application. However, as the government acknowledges, the agency's interview with Aronov was premature. The agency's own regulation dictates that an initial examination should be undertaken only after an applicant's full background check has been completed. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. § 335.2(b) (\"The Service will notify applicants for naturalization to appear before a Service officer for initial examination on the naturalization application only after the Service has received a definitive response from the Federal Bureau of Investigation that a full criminal background check of an applicant has been completed.\"). The government has not explained why it did not follow its regulation in this case.</p>\n<p>At the time of the interview, Aronov was informed that his application could not be approved until additional security checks were completed. After hearing nothing from the USCIS for more than a year, Aronov received a letter from the agency on March 23, 2006 informing him that his application was being actively processed, but that additional review was required. The notice also instructed Aronov to contact USCIS if he did not receive a decision within six months of the date of the notice.</p>\n<p>On August 28, 2006, more than eighteen months after being interviewed by the agency, Aronov filed an action in the district court under 8 U.S.C. § 1447(b), requesting that the court grant his application for naturalization or, alternatively, remand his application with instructions <span class=\"star-pagination\">*33</span> to the agency to adjudicate it.<sup>[1]</sup> Five weeks later, on October 6, the government and Aronov filed a Joint Motion for Remand Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1447(b). In full, the joint motion read:</p>\n<blockquote>Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1447(b), the parties in this action, plaintiff ... and defendants Michael Chertoff, Secretary of the United States Department of Homeland Security, et al., hereby jointly move this Honorable Court to remand this matter to the USCIS, so that [it] can grant plaintiff's application for naturalization, and schedule plaintiff's oath ceremony for no later than November 8, 2006. In support of this motion, the parties state as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>1. On or about August 28, 2006, plaintiff Alexandre Aronov filed this action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>2. Since that date, USCIS has completed its review of plaintiff's application for naturalization and, if jurisdiction is returned to the agency, would grant the application and schedule plaintiff's oath ceremony for no later than November 8, 2006.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>3. The governing statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1447(b), provides that, in cases in which the agency has failed to render a decision on an application for naturalization within 120 days of the examination of the applicant, the applicant may file suit in district court requesting to adjudicate the application and \"[s]uch court has jurisdiction over the matter and may either determine the matter or remand the matter, with appropriate instructions, to the Service to determine the matter.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Wherefore, with good cause having been shown, the parties respectfully request that this Court remand this matter to USCIS so that it can grant plaintiff's application for naturalization and schedule plaintiff for an oath ceremony for no later than November 8, 2006.</blockquote>\n<p>On October 12, 2006, the court entered an electronic order granting the motion and the remand. The docket text for the remand order states: \"Judge Nancy Gertner: Electronic ORDER entered granting <i>3</i> Joint Motion to Remand to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\"<sup>[2]</sup> Aronov was sworn in as a U.S. citizen on November 8, 2006.</p>\n<p>On November 28, 2006, Aronov filed an application for attorney's fees pursuant to the EAJA. The statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote>Except as otherwise specifically provided by statute, a court shall award to a prevailing party other than the United States fees and other expenses, in addition to any costs awarded pursuant to subsection (a), incurred by that party in any civil action (other than cases sounding in tort), including proceedings for judicial review of agency action, brought by or against the United States in any court having jurisdiction of that action, unless the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.</blockquote>\n<p>28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A).

Prevailing Party</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. The District Court's Decision</h2>\n<p>The district court began its attorney's fees analysis by addressing whether Aronov was a prevailing party under the EAJA. Invoking the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Buckhannon,</i> the district court found that the first requirement of the prevailing party standard  whether there was \"a material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties\"  was indisputably met because Aronov's status had changed from legal permanent resident to U.S. citizen. The government does not dispute that this requirement has been satisfied.</p>\n<p>Proceeding to the second element of the test  whether there was a \"judicial imprimatur<sup>[3]</sup> on the change\" in status  the court rejected the government's assertion that the imprimatur requirement had not been met here because the agency had acted voluntarily to grant Aronov's naturalization application. Instead, the court concluded that the remand order satisfied <span class=\"star-pagination\">*35</span> the second element set forth in <i>Buckhannon</i> because the order effectuated the change in legal status that Aronov had sought. The court indicated that the remand did not merely return jurisdiction to USCIS. It also mandated the agency's compliance with a November 8, 2006 deadline for granting Aronov's naturalization. The court noted that \"[w]here the government in <i>Buckhannon</i> took its conciliatory action purely voluntarily, and took on no further duties in the dismissal, the government here was granted not a dismissal, but a remand to the agency <i>conditional</i> on the granting of plaintiff's naturalization action by November 8, 2006.\" (emphasis in original). It asserted, therefore, that \"[h]ad the naturalization not so occurred, the parties might very well be back in front of this court litigating a contempt action. This is far more than a catalyst theory  it was an order of the Court.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Buckhannon</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The issue in <i>Buckhannon</i> was whether a legislative change that effectively awarded petitioner its sought-after relief could provide the basis for a statutory fee award.<sup>[4]</sup> The plaintiff was an operator of assisted living homes who failed a state fire inspection because some of the residents of plaintiff's homes were not capable of \"self-preservation,\" as defined by West Virginia law. On behalf of itself and other parties similarly situated, the home operator brought suit against the state, two state agencies, and several individuals, seeking injunctive and declaratory relief to the effect that the \"self-preservation\" requirement violated provisions of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (\"FHAA\") and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\"ADA\"). Before the federal district court decided the issue, the West Virginia legislature eliminated the \"self-preservation\" requirement by statute. The court subsequently granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the case.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs filed an application for attorney's fees under the FHAA and the ADA, which was denied by both the district court and the Fourth Circuit. The Supreme Court affirmed. The Court held that petitioner could not obtain a fee award in the matter because the legal change had not been judicially sanctioned by a court. <i>Buckhannon,</i> 532 U.S. at 605, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118430\"><a href=\"/opinion/118430/buckhannon-board-care-home-inc-v-west-virginia-dept-of-health-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Fitchburg Public Schools</i>\n</h2>\n<p>As a circuit, we have applied <i>Buckhannon</i> in a number of cases, <i>see </i><i>Smith v.

There, the parents of a disabled child initiated a proceeding under the IDEA against the Fitchburg Public Schools, seeking special education services for their child. After several pre-hearing orders by a hearing officer of the Bureau of Special Education Appeals (\"BSEA\"), the entity in charge of overseeing the proceeding, the parties reached a private settlement that provided the plaintiffs all of the relief they had sought. The plaintiffs subsequently filed an action in the district court seeking to recover attorney's fees pursuant to the IDEA. They argued that the orders of the BSEA, which required the school district to take certain actions and set deadlines for those actions, served as the necessary \"judicial imprimatur\" to grant them \"prevailing party\" status. <i>Id.</i> at 22.</p>\n<p>After recognizing that the administrative relief was not in the form of a consent decree or a final judgment on the merits, and that the plaintiffs had not argued that the administrative orders were functionally equivalent to a consent decree, we addressed in <i>Smith</i> whether the facts of the case generally met the two required elements of <i>Buckhannon.</i><sup>[5]</sup> Acknowledging that the plaintiffs had achieved a material change in the parties' relationship  thereby satisfying the first prong of <i>Buckhannon,</i> we rejected the plaintiffs' claim for attorney's fees on the ground that the BSEA orders had not provided sufficient \"judicial imprimatur\" on the relief obtained. <i>Id.</i> at 27. On this issue, we observed that when the administrative orders were imposed, the BSEA had not yet begun to analyze the plaintiffs' substantive claim  whether they were entitled to relief pursuant to the IDEA  because it had yet to convene a due process hearing. <i>Id.</i> at 26-27. The BSEA's decisions, therefore, were not substantive ones made after reviewing the merits of plaintiffs' claims, but rather orders directing Fitchburg to do what it had already promised the plaintiffs it would do. <i>Id.</i> at 27. Accordingly, the \"orders and ruling were [not] issued ... to place the weight of judicial authority behind Fitchburg's substantive concession that [plaintiff] was entitled to an IEP,\" and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*37</span> hence the relief obtained by the plaintiffs lacked the necessary judicial imprimatur. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. Applying <i>Buckhannon</i> and <i>Smith</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Citing <i>Smith,</i> the government contends that the district court's remand order did not provide the necessary \"judicial imprimatur\" for Aronov's sought-after remedy, naturalization. The government maintains that it already had voluntarily decided to grant Aronov's application. It then established a specific time-frame for doing so, and the court order merely \"memorialized\" the government's independent concessions, as it did in <i>Smith.</i> Further, the remand order did not include any \"appropriate instructions\" directing the government to take specific action, <i>see</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1447(b), or retain jurisdiction in order to determine whether the government followed through on its voluntary decision to approve Aronov's application. Accordingly, the order had no substantive effect on the proceeding and, therefore, did not constitute a \"judicial imprimatur,\" as the Supreme Court defined it in <i>Buckhannon</i> and as we applied the standard in <i>Smith.</i></p>\n<p>We reject the government's arguments and find its reliance on <i>Smith</i> misplaced. Most of the language from <i>Smith</i> relied upon by the government comes in that portion of the panel's decision where it assesses whether the plaintiff's relief, \"even though not in the form of a consent decree or a final judgment on the merits, comports with the overarching requirements of <i>Buckhannon;</i> that is, whether the [administrative hearing officer's involvement] provided the necessary judicial imprimatur on a material alteration of the legal relationship between the parties.\" <i>Smith,</i> 401 F.3d at 26. As the panel noted, \"[the plaintiff] does not argue that the order dismissing her case is the functional equivalent of a consent decree, and thus we deem that argument waived.\" <i>Id.</i> at 24. Moreover, the <i>Smith</i> panel assessed whether the order of an administrative hearing officer, rather than the order of a judge, meets the prevailing party standard set forth in <i>Buckhannon.</i> Since the administrative law analog to a judicial consent decree is uncertain, the focus of the panel in <i>Smith</i> was whether the administrative orders were akin to a judgment on the merits. In short, the <i>Smith</i> decision has little relevance to the prevailing party issue here, which turns on whether the district court's order was the functional equivalent of a consent decree.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, though offered as dicta, the <i>Smith</i> panel made some useful observations about the concept of the functional equivalent of a consent decree. Specifically, the panel distinguished between a court's incorporation of the terms of an agreement between the parties, which made the court order functionally equivalent to a consent decree, and mere recognition of an agreement accompanied by the dismissal of the case because there is no longer a dispute, which was not equivalent to a consent decree. Relying on the Fourth Circuit's decision in <i>Smyth v. Rivero</i><i>,</i> the panel put that critical difference in these terms:</p>\n<blockquote>Thus, \"either incorporation of the terms of the agreement or a separate provision retaining jurisdiction over the agreement will suffice for [an order to be considered the functional equivalent of a consent decree]\" ... In contrast, \"[w]here a court merely recognizes the fact of the parties' agreement and dismisses the case because there is no longer a dispute before it, the terms of the agreement are not made part of the order and consequently will not serve as a basis of jurisdiction.\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>Smith,</i> 401 F.3d at 24 (quoting <i>Smyth v. Rivero,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776760\"><a href=\"/opinion/776760/victoria-smyth-for-herself-and-as-next-friend-for-her-minor-child-angela/\"><span class=\"volume\">282</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">268</span></a></span>, 283 (4th Cir.2002)).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*38</span> Here, the district court held that its remand order fell under the first category of orders  where the court incorporates the terms of the parties' agreement into an order  rather than the second where the court merely recognizes the agreement and dismisses the matter as no longer in dispute. As the district court put it:</p>\n<blockquote>In <i>Buckhannon,</i> the government acted independently to give the plaintiff what it wanted, and <i>then</i> sought dismissal. Here, <i>the</i> Court remanded specifically \"so that USCIS can grant plaintiff's application for naturalization, and schedule plaintiff's oath ceremony for no later than November 8, 2006.\" This is the judicial imprimatur required by and lacking in the specific facts of <i>Buckhannon.</i> Where the government in <i>Buckhannon</i> took its conciliatory action purely voluntarily, and took on no further duties in the dismissal, the government here was granted not a dismissal, but a remand to the agency <i>conditional on</i> the granting of plaintiff's naturalization by November 8, 2006. Had the naturalization not so occurred, the parties might very well be back in front of this Court litigating a contempt action. This is far more than a catalyst theory  it was an order of the Court.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Aronov v.

After Aronov filed suit in the district court under the statute, USCIS lost jurisdiction to adjudicate Aronov's application, thereby precluding it from entering a binding legal agreement with Aronov regarding his application. 8 U.S.C. § 1447(b) (\"Such court has jurisdiction over the matter and may either determine the matter or remand the matter, with appropriate instructions, to the [USCIS] to determine the matter.\"); <i>see </i><i>Etape v. Chertoff,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1023299\"><a href=\"/opinion/1023299/etape-v-chertoff/\"><span class=\"volume\">497</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">379</span></a></span>, 384-85 (4th Cir. 2007).<sup>[6]</sup> The parties acknowledged as much in their joint motion for remand to the district court, which highlights the terms of 8 U.S.C. § 1447(b). Therefore, despite the agency's concession to allow Aronov's naturalization, it did not have the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*39</span> authority to effectuate that outcome until the district court returned jurisdiction to the agency. The court's order was indispensable to the naturalization outcome.</p>\n<p>The court's remand order also ended the dispute by providing Aronov his sought-after relief. To be sure, the district court relied on the government's statements in the joint motion for remand that naturalization was appropriate. However, because of the jurisdictional element, the district court could reasonably conclude that it was ultimately the remand order, not the agency's concession, that brought about the material change in the parties' relationship and \"place[d] the weight of judicial authority\" on the agreed-upon alteration in Aronov's legal status, <i>see </i><i>Smith,</i> 401 F.3d at 26.</p>\n<p>There remains the question of the form of the court's order. If the district court had entered an order explicitly setting forth the agreement of the parties as set forth in the joint motion for remand, its order would unquestionably be a consent decree. <i>See </i><i>Frew v. Hawkins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131155\"><a href=\"/opinion/131155/frew-v-hawkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">431</span></a></span>, 437, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131155\"><a href=\"/opinion/131155/frew-v-hawkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Yet the district court's brief remand order here, which incorporated the terms of the joint motion by reference, had the same import and effect. <i>See </i><i>Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117845\"><a href=\"/opinion/117845/kokkonen-v-guardian-life-ins-co-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">375</span></a></span>, 381, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117845\"><a href=\"/opinion/117845/kokkonen-v-guardian-life-ins-co-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In that event, a breach of the agreement would be a violation of the order, and ancillary jurisdiction to enforce the agreement would therefore exist.\"). Hence the brief remand order was the functional equivalent of a consent decree. If the government had failed to comply with the terms of the remand order, Aronov could have sought enforcement of the order through a contempt proceeding, as the district court noted. He would not have had to file a separate contract action against the agency or another suit under § 1447(b).<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*40</span> There is ample authority for the proposition that the functional equivalent of a consent decree satisfies the requirements of <i>Buckhannon.</i><sup>[8]</sup> Like our sister circuits, we do not read <i>Buckhannon</i> so narrowly as to preclude all forms of judicial relief other than a judgment on the merits or a court order in the form of a consent decree, or one explicitly labeled as such, from satisfying the judicial imprimatur requirement.<sup>[9]</sup> Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that its remand order issued pursuant to § 1447(b) incorporated the terms of the parties' joint motion and hence was the functional equivalent of a court-ordered consent decree.<sup>[10]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*41</span> Accordingly, the order constituted the necessary \"judicial imprimatur\" on the parties' change in legal relationship, qualifying Aronov as a prevailing party.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Substantial Justification</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Framework for Review</h2>\n<p>The government bears the burden of demonstrating that its position was substantially justified. <i>Schock,</i> 254 F.3d at 5. The Supreme Court has interpreted the \"substantially justified\" language in the EAJA to require reasonableness: \"[A]s between the two commonly used connotations of the word `substantially,' the one most naturally conveyed by the phrase before us here is not `justified to a high degree,' but rather `justified in substance or in the main'  that is, justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person.\" <i>Pierce,</i> 487 U.S. at 565, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112137\"><a href=\"/opinion/112137/pierce-v-underwood/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Additionally, the government's position may be substantially justified even if its reasonable interpretation of its legal obligations is not ultimately affirmed by a court. <i>Schock,</i> 254 F.3d at 5. The district court having concluded that the government's litigation position was substantially justified, we review only the government's pre-litigation position. 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(2)(D); <i>Schock,</i> 254 F.3d at 5.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. The District Court's Decision</h2>\n<p>In focusing on the government's pre-litigation position, the court noted that more than a year and a half had passed between Aronov's citizenship exam and the filing of his action  an amount of time that exceeded by a multiple of four the statutory period that was a prerequisite for filing an action under 8 U.S.C. § 1447(b). The court viewed this delay as unjustified because the government had procedures in place for expediting an FBI name check application, including issuance of a writ of mandamus. The court concluded that \"[i]t is not `substantially justified' for the government to force naturalization applicants to incur additional expense  and the courts to be burdened  just to have naturalization applications processed in the timely manner already supposedly guaranteed by statute.\" It rejected the government's argument that it was unable to act on Aronov's application sooner because the FBI did not complete its background check until September 2006.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. The Government's Position</h2>\n<p>The government claims that two statutes justify its actions and inactions on Aronov's application. First, it cites 8 U.S.C. § 1446(a), which provides that \"[b]efore a person may be naturalized, an employee of the [USCIS], or of the United States designated by the Attorney General, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*42</span> shall conduct a personal investigation of the person applying for naturalization.\" It asserts that because the personal investigation of Aronov required by the statute had not been completed before he filed suit, USCIS could not legally grant him citizenship. Second, the government cites language included by Congress in the 1998 Appropriations Act, which has continuing effect: \"During fiscal year 1998 and each fiscal year thereafter, none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available to [USCIS] shall be used to complete adjudication of an application for naturalization unless [USCIS] has received confirmation from the Federal Bureau of Investigation that a <i>full criminal background check</i> has been completed....\" Depts. of Commerce, Justice &amp; State, The Judiciary &amp; Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 1998, Pub.L. 105-119, Stat. XXXX-XXXX-XX (1997) (8 U.S.C. § 1446 note) (emphasis added). It asserts that this language prevented USCIS from taking final action on Aronov's application before the FBI finished its background check in September 2006, after Aronov had filed suit.</p>\n<p>In response, Aronov argues that neither the language of 8 U.S.C. § 1446(a) nor the 1998 Appropriations Act requires the USCIS to undertake the comprehensive FBI name check, which the government concedes has been the primary cause of the delay in Aronov's proceeding. Further, he notes that the agency policy calling for such name checks has not been codified in any regulation. Finally, he cites a report from the USCIS's ombudsman that raised questions about the wisdom of the USCIS policy to require such searches, particularly in light of the significant backlog of applicants waiting for their FBI name checks to be completed.</p>\n<p>Before addressing the parties' arguments, we briefly discuss the FBI name check process and the USCIS's use of that process for adjudicating naturalization applications.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. The FBI's National Name Check Program</h2>\n<p>The FBI's National Name Check Program (\"NNCP\") was established during the Eisenhower Administration by Executive Order 10450. The NNCP reviews information in the FBI's files to determine whether an individual has been the subject of, or mentioned in, any FBI investigations. NNCP provides this information to dozens of federal, state, and foreign agencies \"seeking background information from FBI files on individuals before bestowing a privilege  [w]hether that privilege is government employment or an appointment; a Green card or naturalization; admission to the bar; or a visa for the privilege of visiting our homeland.\" <i>Foreign Travel to the United States: Testimony Before the H. Comm. on Gov. Reform</i> (July 10, 2003) (statement of Robert J. Garrity, Jr., Assistant Dir., Records Mgmt. Div., Fed. Bureau of Investigation), <i>available at</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2003</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">21608243</span></span> (hereinafter <i>Garrity</i>). The NNCP also \"conducts numerous name searches in direct support of the counterintelligence, counterterrorism, and homeland security efforts of the FBI.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The USCIS commissions the FBI on a fee-for-service basis to provide the name checks, in accordance with USCIS-defined standards. USCIS Ombudsman, <i>Annual Report to Congress June 2007,</i> at 38, <i>available at</i> http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/ CISOMB_Annual&amp;Ruml;eport_2007.pdf. The scope of these standards has expanded over time. Until late 2002, the FBI was required to search only its \"main\" files for possible links between the applicant and an individual who was previously the target of an FBI investigation. In late 2002, however, in response to heightened security concerns after the attacks on September <span class=\"star-pagination\">*43</span> 11, 2001, and an incident in which an individual who was a member of a terrorist group was awarded benefits, the USCIS revised its policy and began requiring more comprehensive FBI name checks. These checks entailed a search of the FBI's \"reference\" files in addition to its main investigation files. United States Dep't of Homeland Security, Office of Inspector General, <i>A Review of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services' Alien Security Checks</i> 24 n. 30 (Nov.2005), <i>available at</i> www.dhs.gov/xoig/assets/ mgmtrpts/OIG_06-06_Nov05.pdf; <i>see also</i> Spencer S. Hsu and N.C. Aizenman, <i>FBI Name Check Cited in Naturalization Delays,</i> Wash. Post, June 17, 2007, at A1. Additionally, USCIS resubmitted 2.4 million applicant names to the FBI for these expanded checks. As currently undertaken, the FBI name check process entails the following:</p>\n<blockquote>The name is electronically checked against the FBI Universal Indices (UNI). The searches seek all instances of the individual's name and close date of birth, whether a main file name or reference.... The names are searched in a multitude of combinations, switching the order of first, last, middle names, as well as combinations with just the first and last, first and middle, and so on. It also searches different phonetic spelling variations of the names....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>If there is a match with a name in a FBI record, it is designated as a `Hit,' meaning that the system has stopped on a possible match with the name being checked, but now a human being must review the file or indices entry to further refine the names \"Hit\" on....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Approximately 85% of name checks are electronically returned as having \"No Record\" within 72 hours.... A secondary manual name search usually identifies an additional 10% of the requests as having a \"No Record\" .... The remaining 5% are identified as possibly being the subject of an FBI record. The FBI record must now be retrieved and reviewed. If the records were electronically uploaded into the FBI Automated Case Support (ACS) electronic recordkeeping system, it can be viewed quickly. If not, the relevant information must be retrieved from the existing paper record.</blockquote>\n<p>Garrity, <i>supra.</i></p>\n<p>Before September 11, 2001, the FBI received approximately 2.5 million name check requests per year. After the USCIS revised its policy in 2002, that number increased. <i>Id.</i> For example, in the FBI's fiscal year 2003 alone, it received over 6 million name check requests. Federal Bureau of Investigation, <i>National Name Check Program,</i> http://www.fbi.gov/ hq/nationalnamecheck.htm (last visited June 27, 2008). USCIS currently processes approximately 1.5 million applications requiring name checks annually, including applications both for green cards and for citizenship, and 99% of these are cleared by the FBI in less than six months. Julia Preston, <i>Rules Eased to Expedite Green Card Applications,</i> N.Y. Times, Feb. 12, 2008, at A12. Other applications, however, take longer; approximately 140,000 USCIS applications have been held up in the FBI's name check system for six months or longer. Spencer S. Hsu, <i>U.S. To Skirt Green-Card Check,</i> Wash. Post, Feb. 12, 2008, at A3. As of May 2007, of the about 329,000 cases pending before USCIS, \"64% were stalled [with the agency] for more than 90 days, 32% for more than one year and 17% for more than two years.\" Hsu and Aizenman, <i>supra,</i> at A1.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*44</span> The FBI name check is one piece of the larger background check that the USCIS commissions for all naturalization applicants. In addition to the FBI name check, the agency conducts a name check in the Interagency Border Inspection System (IBIS), \"a multiagency effort with a central system that combines information from multiple agencies, databases and system interfaces to compile data relating to national security risks, public safety issues and other law enforcement concerns.\" Fact Sheet, USCIS Press Office, <i>Immigration Security Checks-How and Why the Process Works</i> 2 (April 25, 2006), <i>available at</i> http://www.uscis.gov/files/ pressrelease/security_checks_42506.pdf. Results of an IBIS check are typically available immediately. <i>Id.</i> The FBI also obtains an applicant's fingerprints in order to search the existing criminal databases for records of arrests and criminal convictions. The FBI typically forwards a response on the fingerprint check to USCIS within 24 to 48 hours. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. Statutory Requirements</h2>\n<p>There is nothing in the language of 8 U.S.C. 1446(a) or the 1998 Appropriations Act that requires USCIS to include the NNCP in the naturalization process. Neither provision cited by the government states explicitly that an FBI name check is required, let alone a name check that includes an evaluation of all FBI reference files in addition to the main files. Section 1446(a) requires only that a \"<i>personal investigation</i>\" be conducted prior to allowing an individual to be naturalized, while the 1998 appropriations bill limits funds to the USCIS to complete adjudication of a naturalization application until the agency has received FBI confirmation that a \"<i>full criminal background check</i>\" has been completed. There is no specification in the bill beyond this phrase. It is entirely plausible  indeed likely  that the language used by Congress in the 1998 appropriations bill referred to the FBI's criminal history check, which is an established, preliminary step taken in the naturalization process, rather than the FBI name check.</p>\n<p>Importantly, the FBI name check program had already been in place for decades at the time the statutes relied upon by the government were enacted. If Congress intended to mandate that the USCIS commission FBI name checks before granting naturalization applications, it could have explicitly referenced such checks. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Cabrera,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">208</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">309</span></span>, 314 (1st Cir.2000) (examining Congress's other textual options in interpreting the statutory language at issue). Other than an unpersuasive reliance on the text of the statutes, the government has not identified any evidence that Congress intended to require the FBI name checks.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*45</span> Indeed, USCIS did not even begin requiring the full, comprehensive FBI name checks until 2002, years after passage of the applicable statutes. That fact confirms that the comprehensive name checks were a result of a policy change within the agency after the September 11, 2001 attacks rather than a congressional mandate.<sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p>In sum, the statutes cited by the government did not require USCIS to commission FBI name checks  let alone comprehensive ones  before adjudicating a naturalization application. Therefore, the \"mandated by statute\" rationale fails as a substantial justification for the agency's delays in adjudicating Aronov's application.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>c. The Application of <i>Chevron</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Perhaps realizing the flaws in its statutory argument, the government offers an alternative basis for finding that its pre-litigation position on Aronov's naturalization application was substantially justified. Relying on <i>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span>, 842-45, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">694</span></a></span> (1984), the government asserts that we must defer to the USCIS's decisions regarding the scope of the \"personal investigation\" and \"full criminal background check\" of an applicant for naturalization because Congress, pursuant to the statutes discussed above, has committed to the agency the decision-making authority on these issues. The government argues that the agency, having concluded that the comprehensive FBI name checks are \"essential\" to the background investigations, was substantially justified in awaiting completion of Aronov's background check before adjudicating his naturalization application. Acknowledging that a small percentage of name checks take a considerable amount of time to complete, the agency asserts implicitly that those isolated delays, which are the fault of the FBI and not USCIS, should not prevent the government from maintaining the name check requirement as its policy and applying to it Aronov's naturalization application. That is, the agency argues that its general policy of requiring the name checks excuses the delays associated with individual naturalization applications, such as Aronov's.</p>\n<p>Even if the government is entitled to invoke <i>Chevron</i> to defend its general policy <span class=\"star-pagination\">*46</span> on the FBI name check process, <i>see, e.g.,</i> Cass Sunstein, <i>Chevron Step Zero,</i> 92 Va. L.Rev. 187 (2006) (analyzing the standards for determining whether an agency interpretation is entitled to evaluation under the <i>Chevron</i> framework), deference to its general policies does not require us to find substantial justification in this particular instance.<sup>[14]</sup> The government's eighteen-month delay in acting on Aronov's naturalization application directly contravened § 1447(b), which gives a district court jurisdiction to evaluate a naturalization application if the agency has failed to adjudicate the application within 120 days after conducting its initial examination. <i>See </i><i>Etape,</i> 497 F.3d at 385; <i>see also </i><i>Hovsepian,</i> 359 F.3d at 1163 (\"A central purpose of [§ 1447(b)] was to reduce the waiting time for naturalization applicants.\" (citing H.R.Rep.

Morrison))) Both the courts and the agency itself have interpreted § 1447(b) as imposing a 120-day deadline for agency action. <i>See </i><i>Hovsepian,</i> 359 F.3d at 1161; 8 C.F.R. § 335.3(a) (\"A decision to grant or deny the application <i>shall be made</i> at the time of the initial examination or within 120-days after the date of the initial examination of the applicant for naturalization ....\") (emphasis added); <i>see also </i><i>Walji v.

July 24, 1997) (\"[T]he 120-day rule provides the court with a measure of what constitutes a reasonable period for INS to process naturalization applications.\").</p>\n<p>Without foreclosing the possibility that the government could provide substantial justification grounded in the facts of a particular case for not complying with the 120-day statutory requirement, the government has advanced no such particularized justification here. Instead, the agency has offered only general justifications for the delay, including the agency's policy of requiring name checks for security purposes and the significant backlog of names that the FBI is processing. These explanations, however, do not justify the agency's disregard of the clear statutory mandate. As a district court deciding this exact issue has aptly stated:</p>\n<blockquote>But while a reasonable person would not dispute the necessity of conducting a background check on an applicant for naturalization, a reasonable person would require a satisfactory justification for a substantial delay in completing the background check. Indeed, government agencies are required to conclude matters presented to them within a \"reasonable time.\" <i>See</i> 5 U.S.C. § 555(b). Otherwise, an applicant for naturalization remains in perpetual limbo and is by de facto, denied his citizenship, a right that has been afforded by Congress to deserving individuals since the rise of the American democracy. This is particularly true when Congress has enacted legislation permitting the applicant to apply to federal district court if a decision is not rendered on the application within 120 days of the completion of the examination under 8 U.S.C. § 1447(b). Here, Defendants offer no justification for the delay; rather, they merely state that \"background checks were necessary and had to be completed before the plaintiff could be naturalized.\" This explanation merely restates, in a conclusory manner, the necessity of completing the background check; it does not justify the delay.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Alghamdi v. Ridge,</i> No. 3:05cv344-RS, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5670940</span></span>, at *14 (N.D.Fla. Sept.25, 2006). Although we also acknowledge that the agency has valid  indeed persuasive  reasons for requiring comprehensive FBI name checks under ordinary circumstances, that policy determination cannot justify the failure to comply with a statutory deadline. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Rotinsulu v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></span>, 72 (1st Cir.2008) (\"An agency has an obligation to abide by its own regulations.\").</p>\n<p>Indeed, despite the agency's assertions that the FBI backlog was a significant cause of the delays in this case, the ultimate cause of the agency's failure to comply with the law was its own non-compliance with its regulations.<sup>[17]</sup> If the agency had properly deferred conducting its initial interview of Aronov until the FBI name check process had been completed, the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*48</span> statutory obligation would not have arisen.<sup>[18]</sup> In its brief, the government has neither explained nor justified its non-compliance with 8 C.F.R. § 335.2(b) in connection with Aronov's application or that of any other naturalization applicant.<sup>[19]</sup></p>\n<p>Therefore, the government's assertion that it was required to wait until Aronov's FBI name check was completed before finally adjudicating his naturalization application does not have \"a reasonable basis in law and fact.\" <i>Pierce,</i> 487 U.S. at 566 n. 2, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112137\"><a href=\"/opinion/112137/pierce-v-underwood/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Indeed, the government's attempt to invoke an administrative policy to trump an explicit statutory command turns <i>Chevron</i> deference on its head. <i>See </i><i>Stinson v.

In light of the 120-day statutory directive, the agency's long delay (over four times the statutory period), and the absence of any evidence that the government tried to expedite Aronov's application to comply with the statute, the government's conduct toward Aronov can only be classified as unreasonable and not substantially justified. <i>See </i><i>Russell v.

However, as in <i>Smith,</i> here the question of whether the order was the equivalent of a consent decree was not raised by either party, nor was that the theory on which the district court relied. Thus the issue was waived. <i>Id.</i> at 24 (the issue is waived if not presented by the parties). Instead, the parties and district court focused on the second situation: whether the district court's order put the necessary judicial imprimatur on the change in Aronov's legal status. The majority should not create arguments the parties and the district court did not use, nor do so to justify its result.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*50</span> But even if the issue had not been waived, the district court's brief order remanding the case is not the equivalent of a consent decree. The order contains no statement incorporating an agreement between the parties or requiring that either party act in a particular way. All the order does is to remand the case at the request of the agency. The order here thus differs from the ones cited by the majority which other circuits have found to be the functional equivalent of consent decrees. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Carbonell v.

It is quite clear that a \"judge's mere awareness and approval of the terms of the settlement agreement do not suffice to make them part of his order.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>I would hold that the district court's order lacks the necessary judicial imprimatur to entitle Aronov to prevailing party status. Our circuit precedent in <i>Smith</i> requires that result. The majority's treatment of the order as the functional equivalent of a consent decree is inconsistent with our holding in <i>Smith.</i><sup>[22]</sup> That case involved an administrative hearing officer's pre-hearing orders, some of which were accompanied by the threat of sanctions, which \"memorialized the voluntary concessions made by [defendant] and attempted to keep the settlement process moving forward in a timely manner.\" <i>Smith,</i> 401 F.3d at 26. We held that these orders, although they imposed specific requirements on defendant, did not have sufficient judicial imprimatur to make plaintiff a prevailing party because they simply made defendant \"follow through with what [defendant] had already voluntarily promised to do.\" <i>Id.</i> at 27. That is exactly the case here. The district court's remand permitted USCIS to follow through with its announced intention to make Aronov a citizen by November 8, 2006. USCIS had voluntarily agreed to do so before it requested the remand. As in <i>Smith,</i> the remand may have kept the process moving in a timely manner, but that is not enough to make Aronov a prevailing party. His claim under the EAJA should have stopped there.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>I also disagree with the majority that the government's pre-litigation position was not substantially justified.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has interpreted the \"substantially justified\" language in the EAJA: \"[A]s between the two commonly used connotations of the word `substantially,' the one most naturally conveyed by the phrase before us here is not `justified to a high degree,' but rather `justified in substance or in the main'  that is, justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person.\" <i>Pierce v.

In particular, the government points to two congressional enactments with which it has complied here. The first is 8 U.S.C. § 1446(a), which provides that \"[b]efore a person may be naturalized, an employee of the [USCIS], or of the United States designated by the Attorney General, shall conduct a personal investigation of the person applying for naturalization.\" The second is language included by Congress in the 1998 Appropriations Act which has continuing effect: \"[D]uring fiscal year 1998 and each fiscal year thereafter, none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available to [USCIS] shall be used to complete adjudication of an application for naturalization unless [USCIS] has received confirmation from the Federal Bureau of Investigation that a <i>full criminal background check</i> has been completed....\" Dep'ts of Commerce, Justice &amp; State, The Judiciary &amp; Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1998, Pub.L. 105-119, 111 Stat. 2440, 2448-49 (1997) (8 U.S.C. § 1446 note) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>The majority faults USCIS for interpreting the phrase \"full criminal background check\" to include a FBI name check. In the end, the award here turns on the majority's view that USCIS did not need to include the FBI name check as part of a \"full\" check, and that the agency's compliance with its name check policy renders its pre-litigation position here (to await the results of a requested name check) not substantially justified. But the agency's policy and its pre-litigation decision to comply with its policy were entirely reasonable.</p>\n<p>The question before us is not whether the language in 8 U.S.C. § 1446 and the 1998 Appropriations Act specifically requires that FBI name checks be part of the background check on citizenship applicants, but whether the agency's interpretation of these statutes as requiring FBI name checks to fulfill its statutory responsibilities renders its position not substantially justified. The position is substantially justified because it was a reasonable interpretation of a legislative command<sup>[23]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*52</span> and that interpretation was committed to the agency's expertise.</p>\n<p>Principles of administrative law require that courts defer to reasonable interpretations by agencies of matters committed to the agency's expertise by Congress. <i>Chevron U.S.A. v.

Even if a reviewing court disagrees with the agency's conclusions, it cannot substitute its judgment for that of the agency.\"). We also note that we are describing a consistent USCIS interpretation and practice, not one adopted for purposes of the issues in this attorneys' fees litigation.</p>\n<p>USCIS, not the majority, has the expertise to determine what should constitute a full criminal background check. The concern that applicants be adequately vetted before they become citizens has taken on added urgency in an age where terrorism is a reality and a continuing threat. That the agency came to decide in 2002 that the inclusion of FBI name checks provided better full criminal background investigations only undercuts the majority's position.</p>\n<p>The majority holds that although a court might ordinarily defer to USCIS's policy of using FBI name checks to fulfill its statutory mandate to complete background investigations on citizenship applicants, here we cannot do so because the agency contravened 8 U.S.C. § 1447(b). The statute permits a citizenship applicant to file suit in federal district court if USCIS fails to adjudicate his application within 120 days of conducting an initial examination. The majority places great weight on this provision, treating it as a \"statutory mandate\" that the agency must adjudicate an application within 120 days of an initial examination. That is plainly not what the statute says. It says only that suit may be brought within 120 days of the examination.</p>\n<p>The provision's legislative history discusses the importance of eliminating delays but says nothing about imposing a deadline on the agency, only that after 120 days relief can be sought in federal court. <i>See</i> 135 Cong. Rec. H4539-02, 4542-43, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">182156</span></span> (daily ed. July 31, 1989). Thus the authorization to file suit in district court is meant to encourage the agency to act fast, but that does not mean that Congress meant to impose a strict deadline on the agency. Indeed, if Congress wanted to impose a strict deadline, it could have done so directly. It is true that the agency's regulations suggest that it treat the 120-day provision as an internal deadline, <i>see</i> 8 C.F.R. § 335.3(a), but that does not create a \"statutory mandate.\" The statute simply governs the timing of suits.<sup>[24]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*53</span> Corresponding with its view that 8 U.S.C. § 1447(b) creates a mandate, the majority suggests that the government would have to make a very strong showing in order to justify missing the 120-day mark. It also faults the government for not advancing a \"particularized justification\" regarding Aronov and why a name check was necessary for him. In my view both rationales are wrong on their own terms and both miss the point.</p>\n<p>Even reading the statute as imposing a deadline on the agency, the majority is nonetheless wrong because there is nothing to say that 8 U.S.C. § 1447(b) was meant to trump the agency's obligations to see that an applicant meets the requirements for citizenship or to trump the agency's mandate to conduct a full criminal background check.</p>\n<p>Here the agency made a mistake by conducting Aronov's initial examination before it had completed his background investigation, including obtaining the results from the FBI of his name check.<sup>[25]</sup> Bureaucracies make mistakes. Given this mistake, the relevant question is whether it was unreasonable for the agency to proceed with the name check even though doing so meant that Aronov could pursue relief in federal court because of the 120-day provision.</p>\n<p>I would hold that it was not unreasonable for USCIS to miss the 120-day mark in order to complete a name check before granting Aronov citizenship. No \"particularized justification\" is necessary because the entire point of conducting name checks is that the government does not know what the check will uncover. As USCIS has stated,</p>\n<blockquote>Although these security checks may require a more lengthy processing time, USCIS believes that performing them is essential to identifying national security and public safety concerns that would not have been uncovered by other means. This is particularly true given that in[ ] a few cases, the information obtained from the FBI through this process has reflected very significant issues and risks. FBI name checks disclose information to USCIS that is otherwise not available.... USCIS is committed to effective background checks, and thus is committed to the FBI name check.</blockquote>\n<p>USCIS, <i>Response to the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman's 2006 Report,</i> at 10, <i>available at</i> http://www.dhs. gov/xlibrary/assets/USCIS-Response-Ombudsman-06-Report-May-2007.pdf.</p>\n<p>Moreover, as the majority points out, although USCIS recently eliminated the name check requirement for visa applicants in order to lessen its backlog, it has not done so for citizenship applicants for the very sensible reason that once a person is granted citizenship, that decision is not easily reversed. There is nothing unreasonable about USCIS's decision to postpone a decision on Aronov's application for citizenship until obtaining information about whether the name check revealed risks to national security or public safety, even if doing so meant that a decision could not be reached within 120 days of his examination.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*54</span> Indeed, the case law also provides no basis for the award here. USCIS's pre-litigation position in this case bears no resemblance to pre-litigation positions that courts have found not to be substantially justified. In <i>Healey v. Leavitt,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"797629\"><a href=\"/opinion/797629/ruth-healey-marcia-lutwin-jane-kozlowski-margaret-a-walz-roger/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></a></span> (2d Cir.2007), the Second Circuit held that the government's pre-litigation position was not substantially justified when the government \"failed to offer any justification for the Secretary's failure to require [home health agencies] to provide written notice of the termination of benefits.\" <i>Id.</i> at 67. Here the agency points to statutes forbidding it to grant citizenship before certain actions are taken. In <i>Sierra Club v. Secretary of Army,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"489491\"><a href=\"/opinion/489491/sierra-club-v-secretary-of-the-army-sierra-club-v-secretary-of-the-army/\"><span class=\"volume\">820</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">513</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1987), this court held that an agency's refusal to prepare an environmental impact statement for a project was unreasonable when there was significant evidence that the project required one and several other federal agencies had advocated for one and warned that one might be legally required. <i>Id.</i> at 519-20 (citing <i>Sierra Club v. Marsh,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"456326\"><a href=\"/opinion/456326/sierra-club-v-john-o-marsh-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">769</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">868</span></a></span>, 874-75 (1st Cir. 1985)). Here, the agency did not act contrary to law, but according to its reasonable interpretation of the law.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>The majority opinion will, in my view, have a number of unfortunate consequences. The majority holds that the government, by acting reasonably and requesting a remand so that it could grant Aronov citizenship, exposed itself to liability under the EAJA because Aronov necessarily became a prevailing party once the court granted the remand. This will discourage USCIS from acting to resolve these cases in a similarly efficient and amicable way in the future. The majority also says that it would be very difficult for the government to show that it was substantially justified in missing the 120-day mark to act on a citizenship application. The majority would thus discourage USCIS from conducting investigations of applicants that could turn up important information but would require longer than 120 days after the applicant's examination for the agency to make a final determination. Ultimately the decision could be contrary to the interests of applicants because in the face of incomplete information, the agency might choose the safer course of denying citizenship.</p>\n<p>I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  8 U.S.C. § 1447(b) reads:\n</p>\n<p>If there is a failure to make a determination under section 1446 of this title [to grant or deny the naturalization application] before the end of the 120-day period after the date on which the examination is conducted ..., the applicant may apply to the United States district court for the district in which the applicant resides for a hearing on the matter.

The parties do not dispute the applicability of <i>Buckhannon</i> in this case.</p>\n<p>[5]  We noted in <i>Smith</i> that this circuit had not \"squarely addressed whether judgments on the merits or consent decrees are the only forms of relief sufficient to confer prevailing party status, whether a functional equivalent of such relief may be adequate, or whether any other types of relief could satisfy <i>Buckhannon</i>'s requirements.\" <i>Smith,</i> 401 F.3d at 23; <i>see also </i><i>Doe,</i> 358 F.3d at 24 n. 4.</p>\n<p>[6]  The question of whether the court maintains exclusive jurisdiction or, alternatively, concurrent jurisdiction with the USCIS has been litigated in other courts. Most courts have held that the district court has exclusive jurisdiction over the application until it has acted pursuant to the statute. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Etape,</i> 497 F.3d at 384-85 (holding that § 1447(b) vests the district court with exclusive jurisdiction over a naturalization application); <i>United States v.

Here, the government does not assert that the USCIS maintained jurisdiction over Aronov's application after he filed suit in district court.</p>\n<p>[7]  This distinction has an analog in the private realm, where one party is seeking to enforce the terms of a settlement agreement against another private party. If the terms of the settlement agreement have not been incorporated into a court order, the federal courts will often lack jurisdiction to enforce its terms. In contrast, where the parties have obtained a consent decree or a court order that either incorporates the terms of the settlement agreement or explicitly retains jurisdiction, a federal court will possess \"enforcement\" or \"ancillary\" jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the order. <i>See </i><i>Kokkonen,</i> 511 U.S. at 381, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117845\"><a href=\"/opinion/117845/kokkonen-v-guardian-life-ins-co-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Bloomberg,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780436\"><a href=\"/opinion/780436/christina-a-by-and-through-her-parent-and-next-friend-jennifer-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">315</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">990</span></a></span> (8th Cir.2003), as an example of a court reading <i>Buckhannon</i> narrowly to preclude all other forms of relief, the Eighth Circuit has more recently repudiated our reading of its decision. <i>See </i><i>Smith,</i> 401 F.3d at 23. In <i>Northern Cheyenne Tribe v. Jackson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792887\"><a href=\"/opinion/792887/northern-cheyenne-tribe-v-alphonso-jackson-in-his-official-capacity-as/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1083</span></a></span>, 1085 n. 2 (8th Cir.2006), the court asserted that its decision in <i>Christina A.</i> did not foreclose the possibility that other types of court-ordered relief could provide the requisite judicial imprimatur required by <i>Buckhannon.</i></p>\n<p>[10]  The dissent asserts that the issue of whether the district court's remand order was the equivalent of a consent decree was not raised by either party, nor was it the theory on which the district court relied, and therefore we should not analyze that issue in deciding the case. The district court did not use the phrase \"functional equivalent of a consent decree\" in its decision awarding attorney's fees and costs to Aronov. Nevertheless, in addressing the judicial imprimatur question in its decision, the district court described its order as incorporating the terms of the parties' joint motion for remand. It further stated that its order could be enforced through a contempt action. Hence the district court described its order in consent-decree terms. The government chose not to challenge this consent-decree aspect of the district court's decision. Instead, it advanced a largely irrelevant judicial imprimatur argument under our <i>Smith</i> decision that it deemed more favorable to its position. Aronov responded to the argument made by the government. He had no obligation to respond to an argument that the government did not make.</p>\n<p>[11]  To help alleviate this backlog, USCIS decided in February 2008 to give preliminary approval to green card applicants for whom an FBI fingerprint check and Interagency Border Inspection Services check have been successfully completed and an FBI name check request has been pending for over six months. If the eventual name check turns up negative information, the visa will be canceled and deportation proceedings commenced. Memorandum from Michael Aytes, Assoc. Dir., USCIS Domestic Operations, to USCIS Field Leadership 2 (Feb. 4, 2008), <i>available at</i> http://www.uscis.gov/files/ pressrelease/DOC017.pdf. This change does not apply to citizenship applicants because \"revoking naturalization is a much more difficult thing to do\" than revoking a green card. Hsu, <i>supra,</i> at A3 (quoting USCIS Spokesman Christopher S. Bentley).</p>\n<p>[12]  Although the government has not invoked it, a regulation relevant to interpreting the scope of the statutory provisions at issue does exist. In full, 8 C.F.R. § 335.2(b) reads:\n</p>\n<p>Completion of criminal background checks before examination. The Service will notify applicants for naturalization to appear before a Service officer for initial examination on the naturalization application only after the Service has received a definitive response from the Federal Bureau of Investigation that a full criminal background check of an applicant has been completed. A definitive response that a full criminal background check on an applicant has been completed includes:</p>\n<p>(1) Confirmation from the Federal Bureau of Investigation that an applicant does not have an administrative or a criminal record;</p>\n<p>(2) Confirmation from the Federal Bureau of Investigation that an applicant has an administrative or a criminal record; or</p>\n<p>(3) Confirmation from the Federal Bureau of Investigation that two properly prepared fingerprint cards (Form FD-258) have been determined unclassifiable for the purpose of conducting a criminal background check and have been rejected.</p>\n<p>The regulation does not assist the agency's claims because, like the statutes, it gives no indication that a \"full\" criminal background check includes an FBI name check.</p>\n<p>[13]  The USCIS's recent change of policy to grant thousands of green-card applicants permanent residency before their full FBI name checks are completed reinforces this view. Although the agency did not take the same step with respect to naturalization applications, it attributed the differential treatment to the difficulty of revising naturalization decisions, not to statutory requirements. Hsu, <i>supra,</i> at A3 (citing USCIS Spokesman Christopher S. Bentley). In so explaining the discrepancy, the agency implicitly acknowledged that it was not prohibited <i>by law</i> from extending the policy to naturalization decisions.</p>\n<p>[14]  Aronov argues on a number of grounds that the USCIS's name check policy is not entitled to <i>Chevron</i> deference. We need not reach that question because of our conclusion that even if the agency is entitled to <i>Chevron</i> deference for its policy requiring FBI name checks, this deference does not substantially justify the government's pre-litigation conduct in this particular instance.</p>\n<p>[15]  The dissent's treatment of the 120-day time frame established by 8 U.S.C. § 1447(b) is curious. Although the dissent acknowledges that the agency has adopted a regulation, 8 C.F.R. § 335.3(a), that treats the 120-day time frame as a deadline, the dissent treats the statutory and regulatory time frame as merely aspirational in nature, with no consequence for the agency if it fails to comply. If Congress had taken such a relaxed view of its 120-day time frame, it would not have explicitly provided that an applicant whose naturalization application remains unresolved at the end of the 120-day period may file suit in federal court to have the application either adjudicated by the court or remanded to the agency with instructions to adjudicate it. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Etape,</i> 497 F.3d at 384-85 (concluding that after an applicant has filed suit with the district court pursuant to § 1447(b), the court has exclusive jurisdiction over the application).</p>\n<p>[16]  8 C.F.R. § 335.3(a) states: \"A decision to grant or deny the [naturalization] application shall be made at the time of the initial examination or within 120-days after the date of the initial examination of the applicant for naturalization under § 335.2.\"</p>\n<p>[17]  Specifically, the agency failed to comply with 8 C.F.R. § 335.2(b). The regulation states: \"The Service will notify applicants for naturalization to appear before a Service officer for initial examination on the naturalization application only after the Service has received a definitive response from the Federal Bureau of Investigation that a full criminal background check of an applicant has been completed.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>[18]  We acknowledge the oddity that arises because of the agency's regulations. If USCIS had complied with its regulations and waited to interview Aronov until the FBI name check had been completed, his waiting time for the completion of the naturalization process might have been longer than it was here. However, this fact does not alter our legal analysis. Once USCIS gave Aronov his initial interview, it had to confront the clear timing obligation imposed by Congress.</p>\n<p>[19]  Based on a recent press release issued by USCIS on April 2, 2008, there appear to be approximately 29,800 applicants whose naturalization applications were submitted to the FBI before May 2006 and whose interviews have already been completed. The agency has requested that the FBI prioritize their name checks. This is one piece of a larger, joint plan between the agency and the FBI to eliminate the backlog of name checks. The FBI also announced its intention to have processed all name checks pending for more than three years by May of this year. <i>See</i> News Release, USCIS, <i>USCIS and FBI Release Joint Plan to Eliminate Backlog of FBI Name Checks</i> (Apr. 2, 2008), <i>available at</i> http://www. uscis.gov/files/article/NameCheck  2Apr08. pdf.</p>\n<p>[20]  We also conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that there are no \"special circumstances [that] make an award [of attorney's fees] unjust.\" <i>See </i><i>Schock,</i> 254 F.3d at 4 (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A)).</p>\n<p>[21]  <i>See also</i> 131 Cong. Rec. S9991-02, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">715613</span></span> (daily ed. July 24, 1985) (statement of Sen. Grassley) (noting that the purpose of the Act was to prevent \"meritless\" government action); <i>id.</i> (statement of Sen. DeConcini) (\"Before the [EAJA], small businesses, faced with unjustified Federal agency actions, were confronted with a difficult choice  to comply without question to Government regulatory enforcement which they believed improper, or challenge the Government, often at a cost exceeding the fine or penalty imposed.\").</p>\n<p>[22]  The majority also suggests that <i>Smith</i> is somehow different because the orders in question came from an administrative hearing officer rather than a district court, but <i>Smith</i> lends no support to that proposition.</p>\n<p>[23]  The majority says that the government has presented no argument that Congress intended that USCIS use the FBI name check. That reasoning puts the cart before the horse. The broad language used by Congress lets the agency determine how best to perform a full criminal background check and does not limit the agency to a particular type of check. There is no evidence, textual or otherwise, that Congress intended to require the agency not to use FBI name checks.</p>\n<p>[24]  Additionally, the cases the majority cites for the proposition that the statute creates a deadline involved different questions. <i>United States v. Hovsepian,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785288\"><a href=\"/opinion/785288/united-states-v-viken-hovsepian-viken-yacoubian-viken-hovsepian-v-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">359</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1144</span></a></span> (9th Cir. 2004), was concerned with the question of whether exclusive jurisdiction rests in the district court after 120 days, and it provided no analysis or support for its observation that § 1447(b) \"requires the INS to make a decision... within 120 days.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1161. <i>Walji v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"50599\"><a href=\"/opinion/50599/walji-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">432</span></a></span> (5th Cir.2007), involved the question of when the 120-day period begins to run and used the language \"the statute is violated in situations such as [petitioner's]\" in the context of supporting its conclusion that the 120-day period applies from the time the examination, and not the entire background check, is completed. <i>Id.</i> at 439.</p>\n<p>[25]  There is no question that doing so was an error. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. § 335.2(b).</p>\n\n</div>",
