She had been promoted in Puerto Rico from\n\nSales Manager to District Merchant in 1993, when she was 50 years\n\nold.       Rivera voluntarily left Sears after she was not hired into a\n\nBuyer position she had sought in 1997.         When Rivera announced her\n\ndecision to retire, various Sears personnel tried to talk her out\n\nof it.        These included her supervisor and the human resources\n\nmanager.\n\n               This is not the usual claim by a former employee that her\n\nemployment was terminated due to discrimination.            The claim is\n\nrather that when Rivera sought reemployment with Sears, she was not\n\nhired for two positions, a District Merchant position in late 2000\n\nand a Buyer position in the summer of 2002.        We affirm, taking all\n\n\n\n       1\n        Rivera's husband and the conjugal partnership brought\nderivative claims under Puerto Rican law.

Pueblo Int'l Inc., 232 F.3d 245, 257-58 & n.7\n(1st Cir. 2000).\n\n                                       -2-\n\ffacts and inferences in plaintiff's favor and engaging in de novo\n\nreview.

Defendants\n\nsay the standard model of inferential proof set forth in McDonnell\n\nDouglas   Corp.   v.   Green,   411   U.S.   792   (1973),   governs.    The\n\nplaintiffs argue that in their opposition to summary judgment, they\n\nchose to have the case treated as a mixed motive case.           See Desert\n\nPalace, Inc. v. Costa, 539 U.S. 90, 101-02 (2003); Price Waterhouse\n\nv. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228, 244 (1989).\n\n           In the end, the question is whether a rational trier of\n\nfact could conclude that the reason, in whole or in part, that\n\nRivera was not hired for either position was age discrimination, or\n\nthat she was not hired for the second position due to retaliation\n\nfor having filed an age discrimination claim.            See Hillstrom v.\n\nBest W. TLC Hotel, 354 F.3d 27, 31 (1st Cir. 2003) (\"[E]ven in\n\nmixed-motive cases, plaintiffs must present enough evidence to\n\npermit a finding that there was differential treatment in an\n\nemployment action and that the adverse employment decision was\n\ncaused at least in part by a forbidden type of bias.\").                 In a\n\nthoughtful opinion, the district court did consider both the mixed\n\nmotive and the McDonnell Douglas claims and concluded that Sears\n\n\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fwould be entitled to summary judgment under either theory. A brief\n\nrecitation of the undisputed facts quickly shows why.\n\nA.        District Merchant Position -- Fall 2000\n\n          In August of 2000 Rivera, then aged 57, learned through\n\na former Sears co-worker that Rebecca Ayala would be leaving her\n\npost as District Merchant at Sears. Rivera called José Burgos, the\n\nvice president of merchandising and marketing at the Sears store,\n\nto ask about taking over this position.    Rivera says that Burgos\n\nresponded: \"Well, I have to talk to [James] Denny [then President\n\nof Sears] and call you back.\"   Rivera never heard back from Burgos\n\nregarding this position.   As was its policy, when Sears announced\n\non October 16, 2000 that Ayala was leaving, it posted the position\n\ninternally.   Sears hired an internal candidate, Luis Fernández, on\n\nNovember 30, 2000.\n\n          It was only after the District Merchant position was\n\nfilled in November of 2000 that Rivera sent a letter requesting\n\nconsideration for hiring, on December 12, 2000, to James Denny,\n\nthen President of Sears.   Thus, the job opening she claims to have\n\nbeen discriminatorily denied did not exist at the time of her\n\nAugust conversation with Burgos and was filled by the time of her\n\nletter of December 12 to Denny.\n\n          Rivera, as a former employee of Sears, confirmed that the\n\ncompany did in fact post positions internally as a matter of\n\ncourse.   A document in evidence, entitled \"The Employment Process\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\ffor Salaried Positions,\" describes the first step as \"Post[ing] job\n\ninternally.\"     Under the policy, the company looks for external\n\ncandidates only if a decision is made that such recruitment is\n\nneeded, in which case both internal and external candidates are\n\nconsidered.    Thus, Rivera would have to show that Sears addressed\n\nthe question of whether external candidates were needed and that\n\nthe   decision   they   were   not     needed    was     motivated   by    age\n\ndiscrimination against her.     Rivera offered no evidence to prove\n\neither point.\n\n          Rivera    suggests   that    as   a   former   employee    she   was\n\nentitled to treatment as though she were an internal candidate.\n\nHowever, Sears' Human Resources Guide for Managers (which did not\n\npurport to give rights to employees in any event) merely says:\n\n\"Retirees and other former associates may be reemployed if their\n\nprior work record was satisfactory.\"            The language disqualifies\n\nformer employees with unsatisfactory work records from reemployment\n\nand does no more.    It certainly does not say former employees are\n\nto be treated as internal candidates.\n\n          Rivera also attacks Sears' explanation that there was a\n\nhiring freeze during this period as to external hires.               She says\n\nthat Sears never informed her of this hiring freeze when she did\n\nnot get the District Merchant job.          She relies on the failure of\n\nSears to produce any written documentation to substantiate its\n\nclaim of a hiring freeze.       Sears instead relied solely on the\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fdeposition testimony of its employees to support the hiring freeze\n\nclaim.    This was a risky strategy for Sears, a national company\n\nwith documented personnel policies, and could well have raised a\n\ndisputed issue of fact.     See McGinest v. GTE Serv. Corp., 360 F.3d\n\n1103, 1123 (9th Cir. 2004) (\"[T]he fact that a company the size of\n\nGTE does not have a memorandum, meeting notes, or other evidence of\n\nthis hiring freeze or the financial difficulties that allegedly\n\nspurred the hiring freeze provides circumstantial evidence that the\n\nhiring freeze did not in fact exist.\").        Here, though, even if the\n\nexistence of a hiring freeze on external candidates were disputed,\n\nthe issue is not material.        No dispute is raised about the fact\n\nthat the vacancy was posted internally and a qualified internal\n\ncandidate had been selected before receipt of plaintiff's December\n\nletter.   There is no evidence of discrimination in the hiring for\n\nthe District Merchant job that could raise any possibility of\n\ninference    of     prohibited     age    discrimination       under     these\n\ncircumstances.\n\nB.          Buyer Position -- Summer 2002\n\n            The second position Rivera sought was a Buyer position\n\nwhich came open in the summer of 2002, when the incumbent, Lissette\n\nBeltran, gave notice of her resignation.        Rivera had been found to\n\nbe unqualified to fill the same position in 1997.             By the time of\n\nher   application   for   the    Buyer   position,   Rivera    had     filed   a\n\ncomplaint against Sears in 2001 alleging age discrimination for the\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\ffailure to hire her for the District Merchant position. Rivera did\n\nnot receive the Buyer position; on August 15, 2002, Frieda Morales\n\nwas hired instead.\n\n           Rivera claims that the failure to hire her for the Buyer\n\nposition   in   the     summer   of   2002     was    motivated      by    both   age\n\ndiscrimination     and     retaliation    against      her   for   bringing       suit\n\nagainst Sears.     Rivera does not argue that she was as qualified or\n\nmore   qualified    than    Morales   for     the    position;     nor    would   the\n\nevidence support such an argument.              Rather, her argument is that\n\nbut for the company's conclusion that she was not qualified for the\n\nBuyer position (which was motivated by age discrimination or\n\nretaliation), she would have gotten the Buyer position and Morales'\n\napplication     would    never   have    been       considered.      The    factual\n\nunderpinning for that argument is simply missing.                          Plaintiff\n\napplied for the job on June 30, 2002.            Morales applied for the job\n\nthe next day.      The job application period was open until July 29.\n\nBoth applicants were considered for the position. So Morales would\n\nhave been considered in any event.                  Further, Sears considered\n\nRivera to be unqualified, just as she had been in 1997.                       Sears\n\nconcluded that five years later she was no more qualified for the\n\nBuyer position, having had no relevant experience in the interim\n\nwhich would have improved her qualifications.\n\n           Against      this   very   strong     evidence     that    it    was   not\n\ndiscriminatory for the company to conclude that since she was not\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fqualified in 1997, then she was not qualified in 2002, plaintiff\n\noffers only two arguments.    Neither suffices to forestall summary\n\njudgment.    The first is that Fernández, who hired Morales in the\n\nsummer of 2002, was notified by the HR department that Rivera had\n\nfiled a discrimination complaint.      Since Sears put on no evidence\n\nas to why this was so, Rivera argues that this notice to Fernández\n\nis sufficient to permit an inference of retaliation against her.\n\nEven taking reasonable inferences in her favor, the evidence Rivera\n\npoints to, the deposition testimony of Fernández, does not support\n\nher contention:\n\n     Q: When [Bob Molina, Sears' District Operations Manager]\n     mentioned [Rivera] for the first time, uh, did he ask you\n     whether you knew her or . . .?\n\n     A [Fernández]: The first time that he mentioned Rivera\n     was in, because of the lawsuit. [W]e were in the process\n     of finding a buyer . . . for my soft lines areas. I lost\n     my buyer. [I] believe [Rivera] ha[d] sent some papers\n     and some resume or something to the company . . . and he\n     had mentioned . . . that I should consider her as part of\n     the process.\n\nFernández also testified that he, in fact, did consider Rivera, but\n\nfound her unqualified for the Buyer position.       Nothing suggests\n\nthat the lawsuit played a role in Fernández' hiring decision.\n\nRivera does not contest that Morales is better qualified, and the\n\nevidence is clear she was in competition with Morales for the job.\n\n            In the end, Rivera's claim of discrimination rests almost\n\nentirely on a purported opinion expressed by the vice president of\n\nmerchandising and marketing, Burgos, that Denny, who was Sears'\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fpresident until the summer of 2002, preferred to work with younger\n\npeople. Burgos' view was not based on any statement from Denny and\n\nno grounds have been offered as to admissibility.                More tellingly,\n\nby the time of the hiring for the Buyer position, Denny was no\n\nlonger the company president and was not involved in the hiring\n\ndecision.      The final interview of Morales was conducted by Gary\n\nSalvatore,      who   was    Denny's      replacement.          No   evidence    of\n\ndiscriminatory motive is offered against Salvatore.\n\n              Under these circumstances, no reasonable jury could have\n\nfound that either hiring decision was motivated, even in part, by\n\nage discrimination; nor could it have found that the decision on\n\nthe   Buyer    position     in    the   summer   of   2002     was   motivated   by\n\nretaliation      against         plaintiff     for    having     filed    an     age\n\ndiscrimination complaint.2           Summary judgment was properly awarded\n\nto Sears.\n\n              Affirmed.     Costs are awarded to Sears.\n\n\n      2\n       Rivera's claims under P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, § 146, also\nknown as \"Law 100,\" and P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, § 194a, also known\nas \"Law 115,\" were also properly dismissed. While Law 100 and the\nADEA allocate the burdens of proof in different ways, see Alvarez-\nFonseca v. Pepsi-Cola of P.R. Bottling Co., 152 F.3d 17, 27 (1st\nCir. 1998), \"the burden of proof on the ultimate issue of\ndiscrimination remains with the plaintiff\" in both causes of\naction, id. at 28. See also Gonzales v. El Dia, Inc., 304 F.3d 63,\n73 n.7 (1st Cir. 2002) (\"[T]he merits of the age-discrimination\nclaims asserted under the ADEA and Law 100 are coterminous.\"\n(citation omitted)). As to Law 115, once the employer has provided\na legitimate non-discriminatory reason, the ultimate burden of\nshowing pretext still falls on the plaintiff. Compare P.R. Laws\nAnn. tit. 29, § 194a(c), with Ramírez Rodríguez v. Boehringer\nIngelheim Pharms., Inc., 425 F.3d 67, 84 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                                         -9-\n\f",

She says that Sears never informed her of this hiring freeze when she did not get the District Merchant job. She relies on the failure of Sears to produce any written documentation to substantiate its claim of a hiring freeze. Sears instead relied solely on the deposition testimony of its employees to support the hiring freeze claim. This was a risky strategy for Sears, a national company with documented personnel policies, and could well have raised a disputed issue of fact. <i>See McGinest v. GTE Serv. Corp.,</i> 360 F.3d 1103, 1123 (9th Cir.2004) (\"[T]he fact that a company the size of GTE does not have a memorandum, meeting notes, or other evidence of this hiring freeze or the financial difficulties that allegedly spurred the hiring freeze provides circumstantial evidence that the hiring freeze did not in fact exist.\"). Here, though, even if the existence of a hiring freeze on external candidates were disputed, the issue is not material. No dispute is raised about the fact that the vacancy was posted internally and a qualified internal candidate had been selected before receipt of plaintiff's December letter. There is no evidence of discrimination in the hiring for the District Merchant job that could raise any possibility of inference of prohibited age discrimination under these circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Buyer Position &#8212; Summer 2002</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second position Rivera sought was a Buyer position which came open in the summer of 2002, when the incumbent, Lissette Beltran, gave notice of her resignation. Rivera had been found to be unqualified to fill the same position in 1997. By the time of her application for the Buyer position, Rivera had filed a complaint against Sears in 2001 alleging age discrimination for the failure to hire her for the District Merchant position. Rivera did not receive the Buyer position; on August 15, 2002, Frieda Morales was hired instead.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera claims that the failure to hire her for the Buyer position in the summer of 2002 was motivated by both age discrimination and retaliation against her for bringing suit against Sears. Rivera does not argue that she was as qualified or more qualified than Morales for the position; nor would the evidence support such an argument. Rather, her argument is that but for the company's conclusion that she was not qualified for the Buyer position (which was motivated by age discrimination or retaliation), she would have gotten the Buyer position and Morales' application would never have been considered. The factual underpinning for that argument is simply missing. Plaintiff applied for the job on June 30, 2002. Morales applied for the job the next day. The job application period was open until July 29. Both applicants were considered for the position. So Morales would have been considered in any event. Further, Sears considered Rivera to be unqualified, just as she had been in 1997. Sears concluded that five years later she was no more qualified for the Buyer position, having had no relevant experience in the interim which would have improved her qualifications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this very strong evidence that it was not discriminatory for the company to conclude that since she was not qualified in 1997, then she was not qualified in 2002, plaintiff offers only two arguments. Neither suffices to forestall summary judgment. The first is that Fern&#225;ndez, who hired Morales in the summer of 2002, was notified by the HR department that Rivera had filed a discrimination complaint. Since Sears put on no evidence as to why this was so, Rivera argues that this notice to Fern&#225;ndez is sufficient to permit an inference of retaliation against her. Even taking reasonable inferences in her favor, the evidence Rivera points to, the deposition testimony of Fern&#225;ndez, does not support her contention:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: When [Bob Molina, Sears' District Operations Manager] mentioned [Rivera] for the first time, uh, did he ask you whether you knew her or ...? A [Fern&#225;ndez]: The first time that he mentioned Rivera was in, because of the lawsuit. [W]e were in the process of finding a buyer ... for my soft lines areas. I lost my buyer. [I] believe [Rivera] ha[d] sent some papers and some resume or something to the company ... and he had mentioned ... that I should consider her as part of the process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fern&#225;ndez also testified that he, in fact, did consider Rivera, but found her unqualified for the Buyer position. Nothing suggests that the lawsuit played a role in Fern&#225;ndez' hiring decision. Rivera does not contest that Morales is better qualified, and the evidence is clear she was in competition with Morales for the job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, Rivera's claim of discrimination rests almost entirely on a purported opinion expressed by the vice president of merchandising and marketing, Burgos, that Denny, who was Sears' president until the summer of 2002, preferred to work with younger people. Burgos' view was not based on any statement from Denny and no grounds have been offered as to admissibility. More tellingly, by the time of the hiring for the Buyer position, Denny was no longer the company president and was not involved in the hiring decision. The final interview of Morales was conducted by Gary Salvatore, who was Denny's replacement.

She had been promoted in Puerto Rico from Sales Manager to District Merchant in 1993, when she was 50 years old. Rivera voluntarily left Sears after she was not hired into a Buyer position she had sought in 1997. When Rivera announced her decision to retire, various Sears personnel tried to talk her out of it.

The claim is rather that when Rivera sought reemployment with Sears, she was not hired for two positions, a District Merchant position in late 2000 and a Buyer position in the summer of 2002.

In a thoughtful opinion, the district court did consider both the mixed motive and the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> claims and concluded that Sears would be entitled to summary judgment under either theory.

Rivera called Jos&#233; Burgos, the vice president of merchandising and marketing at the Sears store, to ask about taking over this position. Rivera says that Burgos responded: \"Well, I have to talk to [James] Denny [then President of Sears] and call you back.\" Rivera never heard back from Burgos regarding this position. As was its policy, when Sears announced on October 16, 2000 that Ayala was leaving, it posted the position internally. Sears hired an internal candidate, Luis Fern&#225;ndez, on November 30, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was only after the District Merchant position was filled in November of 2000 that Rivera sent a letter requesting consideration for hiring, on December 12, 2000, to James Denny, then President of Sears. Thus, the job opening she claims to have been discriminatorily denied did not exist at the time of her August conversation with Burgos and was filled by the time of her letter of December 12 to Denny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera, as a former employee of Sears, confirmed that the company did in fact post positions internally as a matter of course. A document in evidence, entitled \"The Employment Process for Salaried Positions,\" describes the first step as \"Post[ing] job internally.\" Under the policy, the company looks for external candidates only if a decision is made that such recruitment is needed, in which case both internal and external candidates are considered. Thus, Rivera would have to show that Sears addressed the question of whether external candidates were needed and that the decision they were not needed was motivated by age discrimination against her. Rivera offered no evidence to prove either point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera suggests that as a former employee she was entitled to treatment as though she were an internal candidate.

Bottling Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757019\"><a href=\"/opinion/757019/78-fair-emplpraccas-bna-459-74-empl-prac-dec-p-45560-jose-r/\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 27 (1st Cir.1998), \"the burden of proof on the ultimate issue of discrimination remains with the plaintiff\" in both causes of action, <i>id.</i> at 28. <i>See also Gonzalez v. El Dia, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200115\"><a href=\"/opinion/200115/gonzalez-v-el-dia-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">304</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></a></span>, 73 n. 7 (1st Cir.2002) (\"[T]he merits of the age-discrimination claims asserted under the ADEA and Law 100 are coterminous.\" (citation omitted)). As to Law 115, once the employer has provided a legitimate non-discriminatory reason, the ultimate burden of showing pretext still falls on the plaintiff. <i>Compare</i> P.R.
