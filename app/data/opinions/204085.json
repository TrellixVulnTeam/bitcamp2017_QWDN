MEDINA,\n\n                      Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                               v.\n\n              METROPOLITAN LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY,\n\n                     Defendants, Appellees.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                 FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n          [Hon. Gustavo A. Gelpí, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                   Torruella, Lipez and Howard,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Sonia B. Alfaro de la Vega with whom Alfaro Alfaro & Acevedo-\nCarlson, was on brief, for appellees.\n     Frank Gotay-Barquet with whom Gotay & Pérez, P.S.C., was on\nbrief, for appellant.\n\n\n\n                        November 25, 2009\n\f            HOWARD, Circuit Judge.     Plaintiff Luis Medina appeals\n\nfrom the district court's entry of summary judgment in favor of\n\ndefendant Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (\"MetLife\").    Medina\n\ncontends that MetLife violated the Employment Retirement Security\n\nAct of 1974 (\"ERISA\"), 29 U.S.C. § 1001 et seq., by using an\n\narbitrary and capricious procedure in terminating his short-term\n\ndisability benefits and refusing to grant him long-term disability\n\nbenefits.    He also seeks monetary sanctions against MetLife for an\n\nalleged breach of its disclosure obligations under 29 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1132.     The district court found no violation in either of the\n\nbenefits determinations.    We affirm.\n\n            Medina worked as a maintenance technician for Abbott\n\nLaboratories, Inc. in Puerto Rico.        As an Abbott employee, he\n\nparticipated in a disability insurance plan administered by Metlife\n\nthat provided both short-term and long-term disability benefits\n\n(\"the Plan\").    In June 2006, Medina ceased work due to obstructive\n\nsleep apnea and high blood pressure.         Shortly thereafter, he\n\nsubmitted a claim for short-term disability benefits under the\n\nPlan.   His treating physician, Dr. Hector Stella, provided MetLife\n\na diagnostic report.    On August 1, 2006, MetLife informed Medina\n\nthat it would grant him short-term disability benefits for a\n\nlimited period, but would require additional documentation before\n\nany further benefits would be awarded.       Dr. Stella submitted a\n\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fsecond evaluation on August 21, 2006 containing further diagnoses\n\nbut little in the way of specific test results.\n\n              On several occasions over the next two months, MetLife\n\nattempted to contact Medina and Dr. Stella by letter, phone, and\n\nfax   in    order   to   explain     that   more   specific   information      was\n\nnecessary and to request test results and progress notes.                   While\n\nattempts to reach Dr. Stella directly were apparently unsuccessful,\n\nMedina agreed to follow up with him about MetLife's need for\n\nadditional medical information.             On November 13, 2006, Dr. Stella\n\nsubmitted his progress notes covering the period from June 4, 2006\n\nto August 16, 2006.\n\n              In early December 2006, MetLife notified Medina that it\n\nwas terminating his short-term disability benefits.              In support of\n\nits   decision      to   terminate    benefits,    MetLife    stated    that   the\n\ninformation submitted by Dr. Stella was insufficient to support a\n\nfinding of full disability under the Plan's terms.1                    The notice\n\n\n      1\n          Specifically, the notice stated:\n\n           We reviewed the medical progress notes of your\n      physician, Dr. Hector Stella Estevez, dated from June 4,\n      2006 to August 16, 2006. They indicate that you continue\n      to have high blood pressure.      However, the readings\n      documented in the medical reports are within a normal\n      range. Your physician indicated a weight-loss plan but\n      he has not documented what the recommended plan is, what\n      your weight was at the start of the plan and what\n      progress, if any, has been made to date. Your physician\n      gave a diagnosis of congestive heart failure, but he has\n      not furnished any electrocardiogram, medical examination\n      findings, laboratory tests or X-rays to support that\n      diagnosis.   Your physician reports problems with the\n\n                                        -3-\n\falso described MetLife's attempts to obtain more detailed evidence\n\nfrom Dr. Stella.\n\n            In late December 2006, Medina appealed to MetLife to\n\nreconsider its decision, and MetLife agreed to submit the claim for\n\nindependent medical review.   On January 7, 2007, Medina forwarded\n\nadditional progress notes and reports from Dr. Stella detailing\n\nsymptoms, diagnoses, and treatments.      MetLife referred Medina's\n\nentire claim file to an independent medical consultant, Dr. Stephen\n\nKreitzer.    On January 31, 2007, Dr. Kreitzer issued a report in\n\nwhich he concluded that \"there are insufficient clinical findings\n\nor data to support reduction in ability to work full time or that\n\nhe cannot perform his medium work.\"     On February 2, 2007, MetLife\n\nagain attempted to contact Dr. Stella to ask for his thoughts on\n\nthe report and, in the event of a disagreement, any evidence\n\nsupporting a contrary position.    It faxed this request directly to\n\nDr. Stella's office, but Dr. Stella apparently never received it.\n\nMetLife also repeatedly informed Medina that it was trying to reach\n\nDr. Stella and asked him to relay the message in order to assure a\n\nresponse. Medina told MetLife that he had already submitted all of\n\nhis medical records and that Dr. Stella was upset because there was\n\n\n\n     C-pap machine but he does not make any other\n     recommendation. Although we have treatment notes since\n     July, no information is contained in them with respect to\n     physical and/or functional limitations or restrictions\n     that prevent you from returning to your own job as a\n     maintenance technician at Abbott.\n\n                                  -4-\n\fnothing left to send.             By mid-March, MetLife had still heard\n\nnothing from Dr. Stella in response to Dr. Kreitzer's report.\n\n           On March 21, 2007, after reviewing the existing medical\n\ninformation,   findings,      clinical     remarks,      and   Abbott    policies,\n\nMetLife concluded that the original denial of short-term disability\n\nbenefits was appropriate.           It informed Medina that his benefits\n\nwould not be reinstated and that he had exhausted all available\n\nadministrative remedies on that claim.\n\n           Medina    sued    in    the   federal    district     court    for    the\n\nDistrict of Puerto Rico and later filed a motion in that court for\n\njudgment on the administrative record.             The district court granted\n\nsummary judgment to MetLife, and this appeal ensued.\n\n                            I. Denial of Benefits\n\n           Medina maintains that he is entitled to both short-term\n\nand long-term disability benefits.             As to the former, the district\n\ncourt   reviewed    the   administrative        record   and    determined      that\n\nMetLife did not abuse its discretion in denying the claim.                   As to\n\nthe latter, it found that it lacked jurisdiction because Medina had\n\nnot yet exhausted his administrative remedies.                 We review de novo\n\nthe district court's grant of summary judgment.                 Stamp v. Metro.\n\nLife Ins. Co., 531 F.3d 84, 88 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n                    A. Short-Term Disability Benefits\n\n            Because the Plan grants MetLife discretionary authority\n\nto determine eligibility for benefits, we will not overturn its\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fdecision unless it was arbitrary or capricious.     Metro. Life. Ins.\n\nCo. v. Glenn, 128 S.Ct. 2343, 2347-48 (2009); Firestone Tire &\n\nRubber Co. v. Bruch, 489 U.S. 101, 115 (1989).2           Under this\n\ngenerous standard, we inquire into whether MetLife's decision was\n\nreasoned and supported by substantial evidence. Stamp, 531 F.3d at\n\n88.   Put differently, we will uphold MetLife's decision to deny\n\ndisability benefits \"if there is any reasonable basis for it.\"\n\nWallace v. Johnson & Johnson, ___ F.3d ___, No. 09-1069, 2009 WL\n\n3294841 at *3 (1st Cir. Oct. 14, 2009).3\n\n              Medina presents three arguments as to why MetLife's\n\nprocedures in terminating his short-term benefits should be deemed\n\narbitrary and capricious.      None are availing.\n\n\n\n\n      2\n          The Plan states in relevant part:\n\n      In carrying out their respective responsibilities under\n      the Plan, the Plan administrator and other Plan\n      fiduciaries shall have discretionary authority to\n      interpret the terms of the Plan and to determine\n      eligibility for and entitlement to Plan benefits in\n      accordance   with   the   terms  of   the   Plan.     Any\n      interpretation or determination made pursuant to such\n      discretionary authority shall be given full force and\n      effect, unless it can be shown that the interpretation or\n      determination was arbitrary and capricious.\n      3\n      Medina argues that a less deferential standard of review\nshould apply, notwithstanding the Plan's grant of discretionary\nauthority to MetLife, because a \"serious procedural irregularity\nexisted\" that \"caused a serious breach of the plan administrator's\nfiduciary duty.\" Woo v. Deluxe Corp., 144 F.3d 1157, 1160 (8th\nCir. 1998). Even if we were to subscribe to such a rule, we find\nno such irregularity here.\n\n                                   -6-\n\f            First, he alleges that Dr. Kreitzer based his evaluation\n\non false assumptions concerning the extent of his occupational\n\ndemands.     A MetLife case manager had originally classified the\n\nmaintenance technician work that Medina performed as a \"heavy\" job.\n\nYet when Dr. Kreitzer issued the report on which MetLife relied, he\n\nstated that \"there are insufficient clinical findings or data to\n\nsupport reduction in ability to work full time or that he cannot\n\nperform his medium work.\" (Emphasis added). Medina now argues for\n\nthe first time that the description of his job duties as \"medium\n\nwork\" shows that Dr. Kreitzer premised his recommendation on the\n\nbelief that Medina's occupation was less demanding than it actually\n\nwas.     By failing to raise this argument in either the claims\n\nprocess or the district court, however, Medina has waived it on\n\nappeal. Lugo-Velazquez v. Stiefel Labs., Inc. 522 F.3d 96, 99 (1st\n\nCir. 2008); Campbell v. BankBoston, N.A., 327 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).    We therefore do not address it.\n\n            Second,    Medina      claims    that   MetLife      did   not    accord\n\nsufficient    weight    to   Dr.    Stella's   evaluations       in    considering\n\nwhether his physical impairment met the Plan's definition of \"full\n\ndisability.\" Yet \"courts have no warrant to require administrators\n\nautomatically   to     accord   special      weight   to   the    opinions     of   a\n\nclaimant's physician; nor may courts impose on plan administrators\n\na discrete burden of explanation when they credit reliable evidence\n\nthat conflicts with a treating physician's evaluation.\"                      Black &\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fDecker Disability Plan v. Nord, 538 U.S. 822, 834 (2003).                     \"[A]\n\nplan administrator is not obligated to accept or even to give\n\nparticular    weight      to   the    opinion   of   a   claimant's    treating\n\nphysician.\"    Morales-Alejandro v. Med. Card Sys., Inc., 486 F.3d\n\n693, 700 (1st Cir. 2007).              Consequently, \"in the presence of\n\nconflicting evidence, it is entirely appropriate for a reviewing\n\ncourt to uphold the decision of the entity entitled to exercise its\n\ndiscretion.\"    Gannon v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 360 F.3d 211, 216\n\n(1st Cir. 2004).\n\n            In this case, Dr. Kreitzer had substantive reasons for\n\ndiverging    from   Dr.    Stella's    assessment.       In   his   report,    Dr.\n\nKreitzer noted that most of the medical information that Medina had\n\nprovided through Dr. Stella was not recent; that many significant\n\ndiagnostic tests had not been performed; that it is very rare for\n\nsleep apnea to cause impairment; and that there were insufficient\n\nclinical findings or data to support reduction in work ability. We\n\nconclude that these findings by an independent medical examiner\n\ngave MetLife the requisite \"substantial evidentiary grounds for a\n\nreasonable decision in its favor.\"            Denmark v. Liberty Life Assur.\n\nCo. of Boston, 566 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2009)(citation omitted).\n\n            Third, Medina claims that MetLife was required to wait\n\nfor Dr. Stella to offer his feedback on Dr. Kreitzer's report\n\nbefore reaching a final determination.               MetLife alleges that it\n\nfaxed a copy of the report to Dr. Stella along with a solicitation\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\ffor his review.    The fax itself is contained in the administrative\n\nrecord.   Medina nevertheless avers that the fax must not have ever\n\nsuccessfully    reached    its   intended   destination.      According   to\n\nMedina,   any   decision    that   did    not   incorporate   Dr.   Stella's\n\nadditional feedback can only be viewed as arbitrary because MetLife\n\nmust have considered that feedback to be absolutely necessary;\n\notherwise, Medina argues, MetLife would not have attempted to\n\nsolicit Stella's reaction to begin with.\n\n           The record, however, indicates that Medina was on ample\n\nnotice that MetLife was trying to reach Dr. Stella.                  Through\n\nmultiple letters and phone calls, MetLife made clear to Medina that\n\nit was attempting to obtain more detailed information from his\n\nphysician.      Dr. Stella had multiple opportunities to present\n\nevidence to rebut Dr. Kreitzer's findings.            He instead remained\n\nsilent.   If, as we have already observed, an administrator is not\n\nobliged to place particular weight on the opinion of a claimant's\n\ntreating physician, then we cannot see how an administrator could\n\nhave an obligation to wait indefinitely for an opinion that is not\n\nforthcoming.      When the treating physician fails to respond to\n\nrepeated requests for further data, the administrator is entitled\n\nto review the information available, so long as that information\n\nprovides a sufficient basis to make a reasonable determination.\n\n           Such was the case here.          It was not as though MetLife\n\nlacked the benefit of Dr. Stella's observations entirely.             At the\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\ftime MetLife rendered its decision, it had reviewed Dr. Stella's\n\nprogress notes dated June 4, 2006 to August 16, 2006, as well as\n\nhis January 7, 2007 report.          Indeed, the record indicates that Dr.\n\nStella himself felt that there was nothing left for him to submit.\n\nThough MetLife was evidently willing to consider other information\n\nif   it   became    available,      it   had    the     prerogative   to   reach   a\n\nconclusion based on the existing reports from Dr. Stella and Dr.\n\nKreitzer.\n\n                     B. Long-Term Disability Benefits\n\n             A plaintiff who wishes to raise an ERISA claim in federal\n\ncourt must first exhaust all administrative remedies that the\n\nfiduciary provides.         Madera v. Marsh USA, Inc., 426 F.3d 56, 61\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).      The district court found that Medina had failed\n\nto do so with respect to his request for long-term disability\n\nbenefits because he had never actually submitted a benefits claim\n\nfor evaluation and adjudication.               We review this finding of fact\n\nfor clear error.      Green v. ExxonMobil Corp., 470 F.3d 415, 418 (1st\n\nCir. 2006).\n\n             Medina does not attempt to rebut the district court's\n\nconclusion with any direct evidence that he did in fact submit a\n\nlong-term disability benefits claim.                 Instead, he asks us to infer\n\nas   much    circumstantially        from      two    events   described   in    the\n\nadministrative record:           (1) on June 15, 2006, Medina signed a form\n\nin   which   he    agreed   to    remiburse      Abbott    Laboratories    for   any\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\foverpayment on long-term disability benefits; and (2) in an October\n\n26, 2006 letter to Medina, MetLife used the phrase \"in reference to\n\nyour long-term disability claim.\"        Based on these two documents,\n\nMedina maintains that both his employer and MetLife \"expressly\n\nrecognize\" that he had submitted claims for long-term disability\n\nbenefits, and thus that he would have exhausted his administrative\n\nremedies.\n\n            We do not find this evidence to be persuasive.        Medina\n\nconsistently and conspicuously avoids any affirmative statement\n\nthat he actually filed the phantom claim, trying to carry his\n\nburden purely through the words of others.      Yet those words are not\n\nnearly as significant as Medina argues.         The June 15 agreement\n\nappears to be a boilerplate form which includes sections for both\n\nshort-term and long-term disability benefits.           Nowhere does it\n\nstate that Medina actually lodged a claim for long-term disability\n\nbenefits specifically. As for the October 26 letter, to the extent\n\nthat it suggests that a claim was filed, we think Medina's own\n\nsubsequent communications prove otherwise.            On July 2, 2007,\n\nMedina's attorney wrote a letter to a member of MetLife's Benefits\n\nDepartment   in   which   he   expressed   interest   \"in   applying   and\n\nrequesting benefits under the Long Term Disability (LTD) plan\" and\n\nrequesting \"any instructions and information necessary to proceed\n\nwith an application.\"     This letter weighs heavily against Medina's\n\ncircumstantial proffer. In light of this communication, along with\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fthe complete absence in the record of any persuasive evidence that\n\nMedina ever filed the claim to which he refers, the district court\n\ndid not clearly err in finding that Medina failed to exhaust his\n\nadministrative remedies.\n\n                      II. Disclosure Obligations\n\n             In a separate argument, Medina contends that MetLife's\n\nfailure to provide him with a copy of the fax to Dr. Stella\n\nconstituted a sanctionable violation of its disclosure obligations\n\nunder   29   U.S.C.   § 1132(c)(1)(B).    That   section   provides   in\n\npertinent part:\n\n             Any administrator . . . who fails or refuses\n             to comply with a request for any information\n             which such administrator is required by this\n             subchapter to furnish to a participant or\n             beneficiary . . . by mailing the material\n             requested to the last known address of the\n             requesting participant or beneficiary within\n             30 days after such request may in the court's\n             discretion be personally liable to such\n             participant or beneficiary in the amount of up\n             to $100 a day from the date of such failure or\n             refusal, and the court may in its discretion\n             order such other relief as it deems proper.\n\n             On April 12, 2007, Medina wrote to MetLife requesting all\n\nrelevant documents on which it had relied in reaching its decision\n\nto deny short-term disability benefits.     He specifically asked for\n\na copy of the fax sent to Dr. Stella, along with a confirmation\n\npage showing that the fax had successfully been transmitted.          On\n\nApril 25, 2007, MetLife sent Medina the entire case file. Medina's\n\nclaim on appeal is that because this file did not contain the\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\frequested transmission confirmation sheet (the fax itself was\n\nproduced), MetLife is liable for sanctions under § 1132.\n\n              Medina's conclusion is a non sequitur. First, the remedy\n\nhe    seeks   is   not    available     for     his   alleged   grievance.      The\n\nsubstantive requirement that MetLife furnish requested documents\n\nafter a denial of a claim is located in § 1133, which obligates\n\ninsurance     plans      to   \"afford    a    reasonable   opportunity     to   any\n\nparticipant whose claim for benefits has been denied for a full and\n\nfair review by the appropriate named fiduciary of the decision\n\ndenying the claim.\"            29 U.S.C. § 1133(2); see also 29 C.F.R.\n\n§ 2560.503-1(h)(2)(iii) (delineating requirements for a \"full and\n\nfair review\").        It is well established that a violation of § 1133\n\nand    its    implementing      regulations       does   not    trigger   monetary\n\nsanctions under § 1132(c).              See, e.g., Wilczynski v. Lumbermens\n\nMut. Cas. Co., 93 F.3d 397, 406 (7th Cir. 1996); Sturhlreyer v.\n\nArmco, Inc. 12 F.3d 75, 79(6th Cir. 1993); Groves v. Modified Ret.\n\nPlan, 803 F.2d 109, 117-18 (3d Cir. 1986). Sanctions are therefore\n\nunavailable here.\n\n              Second, even if sanctions were available, we see no foul\n\nthat would merit them.            Section 1133's implementing regulation\n\nprovides:\n\n              [T]he claims procedures of a plan will not be\n              deemed to provide a claimant with a reasonable\n              opportunity for a full and fair review of a\n              claim and adverse benefit determination unless\n              the claims procedures . . . [p]rovide that a\n              claimant shall be provided, upon request and\n\n                                         -13-\n\f            free of charge, reasonable access to, and\n            copies of, all documents, records, and other\n            information relevant to the claimant's claim\n            for benefits.\n\n29 C.F.R. § 2560.503-1(h)(2)(iii).       MetLife, which mailed the\n\nentire claim file a week after receiving Medina's request, more\n\nthan   sufficiently   met   the   regulation's   \"reasonable   access\"\n\nstandard.   Although Medina demands a fax transmission confirmation\n\nin addition to the fax itself, there is no reason to think that\n\nsuch a document was ever part of the file, and its absence is not\n\na violation.\n\n                        III. Attorney's Fees\n\n            Finally, Medina argues that the district court erred in\n\nnot awarding him attorney's fees.    \"[W]e will disturb such rulings\n\nonly if the record persuades us that the trial court indulged in a\n\nserious lapse in judgment.\"        Twomey v. Delta Airlines Pilots\n\nPension Plan, 328 F.3d 27, 33 (1st Cir. 2003).      These awards are,\n\nof course, \"normally for the prevailing party.\"      Doe v. Travelers\n\nIns. Co., 167 F.3d 53, 60 (1st Cir. 1999).       Because we conclude\n\nthat Medina does not prevail on any of his substantive claims, we\n\naffirm the district court's denial of Medina's request for fee-\n\nshifting.\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\f",

Plaintiff Luis Medina appeals\n\nfrom the district court's entry of summary judgment in favor of\n\ndefendant Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (\"MetLife\").    Medina\n\ncontends that MetLife violated the Employment Retirement Security\n\nAct of 1974 (\"ERISA\"), 29 U.S.C. § 1001 et seq., by using an\n\narbitrary and capricious procedure in terminating his short-term\n\ndisability benefits and refusing to grant him long-term disability\n\nbenefits.    He also seeks monetary sanctions against MetLife for an\n\nalleged breach of its disclosure obligations under 29 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1132.     The district court found no violation in either of the\n\nbenefits determinations.    We affirm.\n\n            Medina worked as a maintenance technician for Abbott\n\nLaboratories, Inc. in Puerto Rico.        As an Abbott employee, he\n\nparticipated in a disability insurance plan administered by Metlife\n\nthat provided both short-term and long-term disability benefits\n\n(\"the Plan\").    In June 2006, Medina ceased work due to obstructive\n\nsleep apnea and high blood pressure.         Shortly thereafter, he\n\nsubmitted a claim for short-term disability benefits under the\n\nPlan.   His treating physician, Dr. Hector Stella, provided MetLife\n\na diagnostic report.    On August 1, 2006, MetLife informed Medina\n\nthat it would grant him short-term disability benefits for a\n\nlimited period, but would require additional documentation before\n\nany further benefits would be awarded.       Dr. Stella submitted a\n\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fsecond evaluation on August 21, 2006 containing further diagnoses\n\nbut little in the way of specific test results.\n\n              On several occasions over the next two months, MetLife\n\nattempted to contact Medina and Dr. Stella by letter, phone, and\n\nfax   in    order   to   explain     that   more   specific   information      was\n\nnecessary and to request test results and progress notes.                   While\n\nattempts to reach Dr. Stella directly were apparently unsuccessful,\n\nMedina agreed to follow up with him about MetLife's need for\n\nadditional medical information.             On November 13, 2006, Dr. Stella\n\nsubmitted his progress notes covering the period from June 4, 2006\n\nto August 16, 2006.\n\n              In early December 2006, MetLife notified Medina that it\n\nwas terminating his short-term disability benefits.              In support of\n\nits   decision      to   terminate    benefits,    MetLife    stated    that   the\n\ninformation submitted by Dr. Stella was insufficient to support a\n\nfinding of full disability under the Plan's terms.1                    The notice\n\n\n      1\n          Specifically, the notice stated:\n\n           We reviewed the medical progress notes of your\n      physician, Dr. Hector Stella Estevez, dated from June 4,\n      2006 to August 16, 2006. They indicate that you continue\n      to have high blood pressure.      However, the readings\n      documented in the medical reports are within a normal\n      range. Your physician indicated a weight-loss plan but\n      he has not documented what the recommended plan is, what\n      your weight was at the start of the plan and what\n      progress, if any, has been made to date. Your physician\n      gave a diagnosis of congestive heart failure, but he has\n      not furnished any electrocardiogram, medical examination\n      findings, laboratory tests or X-rays to support that\n      diagnosis.   Your physician reports problems with the\n\n                                        -3-\n\falso described MetLife's attempts to obtain more detailed evidence\n\nfrom Dr. Stella.\n\n            In late December 2006, Medina appealed to MetLife to\n\nreconsider its decision, and MetLife agreed to submit the claim for\n\nindependent medical review.   On January 7, 2007, Medina forwarded\n\nadditional progress notes and reports from Dr. Stella detailing\n\nsymptoms, diagnoses, and treatments.      MetLife referred Medina's\n\nentire claim file to an independent medical consultant, Dr. Stephen\n\nKreitzer.    On January 31, 2007, Dr. Kreitzer issued a report in\n\nwhich he concluded that \"there are insufficient clinical findings\n\nor data to support reduction in ability to work full time or that\n\nhe cannot perform his medium work.\"     On February 2, 2007, MetLife\n\nagain attempted to contact Dr. Stella to ask for his thoughts on\n\nthe report and, in the event of a disagreement, any evidence\n\nsupporting a contrary position.    It faxed this request directly to\n\nDr. Stella's office, but Dr. Stella apparently never received it.\n\nMetLife also repeatedly informed Medina that it was trying to reach\n\nDr. Stella and asked him to relay the message in order to assure a\n\nresponse. Medina told MetLife that he had already submitted all of\n\nhis medical records and that Dr. Stella was upset because there was\n\n\n\n     C-pap machine but he does not make any other\n     recommendation. Although we have treatment notes since\n     July, no information is contained in them with respect to\n     physical and/or functional limitations or restrictions\n     that prevent you from returning to your own job as a\n     maintenance technician at Abbott.\n\n                                  -4-\n\fnothing left to send.             By mid-March, MetLife had still heard\n\nnothing from Dr. Stella in response to Dr. Kreitzer's report.\n\n           On March 21, 2007, after reviewing the existing medical\n\ninformation,   findings,      clinical     remarks,      and   Abbott    policies,\n\nMetLife concluded that the original denial of short-term disability\n\nbenefits was appropriate.           It informed Medina that his benefits\n\nwould not be reinstated and that he had exhausted all available\n\nadministrative remedies on that claim.\n\n           Medina    sued    in    the   federal    district     court    for    the\n\nDistrict of Puerto Rico and later filed a motion in that court for\n\njudgment on the administrative record.             The district court granted\n\nsummary judgment to MetLife, and this appeal ensued.\n\n                            I. Denial of Benefits\n\n           Medina maintains that he is entitled to both short-term\n\nand long-term disability benefits.             As to the former, the district\n\ncourt   reviewed    the   administrative        record   and    determined      that\n\nMetLife did not abuse its discretion in denying the claim.                   As to\n\nthe latter, it found that it lacked jurisdiction because Medina had\n\nnot yet exhausted his administrative remedies.

Oct. 14, 2009).3\n\n              Medina presents three arguments as to why MetLife's\n\nprocedures in terminating his short-term benefits should be deemed\n\narbitrary and capricious.      None are availing.\n\n\n\n\n      2\n          The Plan states in relevant part:\n\n      In carrying out their respective responsibilities under\n      the Plan, the Plan administrator and other Plan\n      fiduciaries shall have discretionary authority to\n      interpret the terms of the Plan and to determine\n      eligibility for and entitlement to Plan benefits in\n      accordance   with   the   terms  of   the   Plan.     Any\n      interpretation or determination made pursuant to such\n      discretionary authority shall be given full force and\n      effect, unless it can be shown that the interpretation or\n      determination was arbitrary and capricious.\n      3\n      Medina argues that a less deferential standard of review\nshould apply, notwithstanding the Plan's grant of discretionary\nauthority to MetLife, because a \"serious procedural irregularity\nexisted\" that \"caused a serious breach of the plan administrator's\nfiduciary duty.\" Woo v. Deluxe Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"754602\"><a href=\"/opinion/754602/beverly-d-woo-v-deluxe-corp-hartford-life-insurance-co-doing-business/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1157</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1160 (8th\nCir. 1998). Even if we were to subscribe to such a rule, we find\nno such irregularity here.\n\n                                   -6-\n\f            First, he alleges that Dr. Kreitzer based his evaluation\n\non false assumptions concerning the extent of his occupational\n\ndemands.     A MetLife case manager had originally classified the\n\nmaintenance technician work that Medina performed as a \"heavy\" job.\n\nYet when Dr. Kreitzer issued the report on which MetLife relied, he\n\nstated that \"there are insufficient clinical findings or data to\n\nsupport reduction in ability to work full time or that he cannot\n\nperform his medium work.\" (Emphasis added). Medina now argues for\n\nthe first time that the description of his job duties as \"medium\n\nwork\" shows that Dr. Kreitzer premised his recommendation on the\n\nbelief that Medina's occupation was less demanding than it actually\n\nwas.     By failing to raise this argument in either the claims\n\nprocess or the district court, however, Medina has waived it on\n\nappeal. Lugo-Velazquez v. Stiefel Labs., Inc. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203228\"><a href=\"/opinion/203228/lugo-velazquez-v-stiefel-laboratories-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 99 (1st\n\nCir. 2008); Campbell v.

We therefore do not address it.\n\n            Second,    Medina      claims    that   MetLife      did   not    accord\n\nsufficient    weight    to   Dr.    Stella's   evaluations       in    considering\n\nwhether his physical impairment met the Plan's definition of \"full\n\ndisability.\" Yet \"courts have no warrant to require administrators\n\nautomatically   to     accord   special      weight   to   the    opinions     of   a\n\nclaimant's physician; nor may courts impose on plan administrators\n\na discrete burden of explanation when they credit reliable evidence\n\nthat conflicts with a treating physician's evaluation.\"                      Black &\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fDecker Disability Plan v.

In   his   report,    Dr.\n\nKreitzer noted that most of the medical information that Medina had\n\nprovided through Dr. Stella was not recent; that many significant\n\ndiagnostic tests had not been performed; that it is very rare for\n\nsleep apnea to cause impairment; and that there were insufficient\n\nclinical findings or data to support reduction in work ability. We\n\nconclude that these findings by an independent medical examiner\n\ngave MetLife the requisite \"substantial evidentiary grounds for a\n\nreasonable decision in its favor.\"            Denmark v. Liberty Life Assur.\n\nCo. of Boston, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">566</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 6 (1st Cir. 2009)(citation omitted).\n\n            Third, Medina claims that MetLife was required to wait\n\nfor Dr. Stella to offer his feedback on Dr. Kreitzer's report\n\nbefore reaching a final determination.               MetLife alleges that it\n\nfaxed a copy of the report to Dr. Stella along with a solicitation\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\ffor his review.    The fax itself is contained in the administrative\n\nrecord.   Medina nevertheless avers that the fax must not have ever\n\nsuccessfully    reached    its   intended   destination.      According   to\n\nMedina,   any   decision    that   did    not   incorporate   Dr.   Stella's\n\nadditional feedback can only be viewed as arbitrary because MetLife\n\nmust have considered that feedback to be absolutely necessary;\n\notherwise, Medina argues, MetLife would not have attempted to\n\nsolicit Stella's reaction to begin with.\n\n           The record, however, indicates that Medina was on ample\n\nnotice that MetLife was trying to reach Dr. Stella.                  Through\n\nmultiple letters and phone calls, MetLife made clear to Medina that\n\nit was attempting to obtain more detailed information from his\n\nphysician.      Dr. Stella had multiple opportunities to present\n\nevidence to rebut Dr. Kreitzer's findings.            He instead remained\n\nsilent.   If, as we have already observed, an administrator is not\n\nobliged to place particular weight on the opinion of a claimant's\n\ntreating physician, then we cannot see how an administrator could\n\nhave an obligation to wait indefinitely for an opinion that is not\n\nforthcoming.      When the treating physician fails to respond to\n\nrepeated requests for further data, the administrator is entitled\n\nto review the information available, so long as that information\n\nprovides a sufficient basis to make a reasonable determination.\n\n           Such was the case here.          It was not as though MetLife\n\nlacked the benefit of Dr. Stella's observations entirely.             At the\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\ftime MetLife rendered its decision, it had reviewed Dr. Stella's\n\nprogress notes dated June 4, 2006 to August 16, 2006, as well as\n\nhis January 7, 2007 report.          Indeed, the record indicates that Dr.\n\nStella himself felt that there was nothing left for him to submit.\n\nThough MetLife was evidently willing to consider other information\n\nif   it   became    available,      it   had    the     prerogative   to   reach   a\n\nconclusion based on the existing reports from Dr. Stella and Dr.\n\nKreitzer.\n\n                     B. Long-Term Disability Benefits\n\n             A plaintiff who wishes to raise an ERISA claim in federal\n\ncourt must first exhaust all administrative remedies that the\n\nfiduciary provides.

The district court found that Medina had failed\n\nto do so with respect to his request for long-term disability\n\nbenefits because he had never actually submitted a benefits claim\n\nfor evaluation and adjudication.               We review this finding of fact\n\nfor clear error.      Green v. ExxonMobil Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202535\"><a href=\"/opinion/202535/green-v-exxon-mobil-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">415</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 418 (1st\n\nCir. 2006).\n\n             Medina does not attempt to rebut the district court's\n\nconclusion with any direct evidence that he did in fact submit a\n\nlong-term disability benefits claim.                 Instead, he asks us to infer\n\nas   much    circumstantially        from      two    events   described   in    the\n\nadministrative record:           (1) on June 15, 2006, Medina signed a form\n\nin   which   he    agreed   to    remiburse      Abbott    Laboratories    for   any\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\foverpayment on long-term disability benefits; and (2) in an October\n\n26, 2006 letter to Medina, MetLife used the phrase \"in reference to\n\nyour long-term disability claim.\"        Based on these two documents,\n\nMedina maintains that both his employer and MetLife \"expressly\n\nrecognize\" that he had submitted claims for long-term disability\n\nbenefits, and thus that he would have exhausted his administrative\n\nremedies.\n\n            We do not find this evidence to be persuasive.        Medina\n\nconsistently and conspicuously avoids any affirmative statement\n\nthat he actually filed the phantom claim, trying to carry his\n\nburden purely through the words of others.      Yet those words are not\n\nnearly as significant as Medina argues.         The June 15 agreement\n\nappears to be a boilerplate form which includes sections for both\n\nshort-term and long-term disability benefits.           Nowhere does it\n\nstate that Medina actually lodged a claim for long-term disability\n\nbenefits specifically. As for the October 26 letter, to the extent\n\nthat it suggests that a claim was filed, we think Medina's own\n\nsubsequent communications prove otherwise.            On July 2, 2007,\n\nMedina's attorney wrote a letter to a member of MetLife's Benefits\n\nDepartment   in   which   he   expressed   interest   \"in   applying   and\n\nrequesting benefits under the Long Term Disability (LTD) plan\" and\n\nrequesting \"any instructions and information necessary to proceed\n\nwith an application.\"     This letter weighs heavily against Medina's\n\ncircumstantial proffer. In light of this communication, along with\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fthe complete absence in the record of any persuasive evidence that\n\nMedina ever filed the claim to which he refers, the district court\n\ndid not clearly err in finding that Medina failed to exhaust his\n\nadministrative remedies.\n\n                      II. Disclosure Obligations\n\n             In a separate argument, Medina contends that MetLife's\n\nfailure to provide him with a copy of the fax to Dr. Stella\n\nconstituted a sanctionable violation of its disclosure obligations\n\nunder   29   U.S.C.   § 1132(c)(1)(B).    That   section   provides   in\n\npertinent part:\n\n             Any administrator . . . who fails or refuses\n             to comply with a request for any information\n             which such administrator is required by this\n             subchapter to furnish to a participant or\n             beneficiary . . . by mailing the material\n             requested to the last known address of the\n             requesting participant or beneficiary within\n             30 days after such request may in the court's\n             discretion be personally liable to such\n             participant or beneficiary in the amount of up\n             to $100 a day from the date of such failure or\n             refusal, and the court may in its discretion\n             order such other relief as it deems proper.\n\n             On April 12, 2007, Medina wrote to MetLife requesting all\n\nrelevant documents on which it had relied in reaching its decision\n\nto deny short-term disability benefits.     He specifically asked for\n\na copy of the fax sent to Dr. Stella, along with a confirmation\n\npage showing that the fax had successfully been transmitted.          On\n\nApril 25, 2007, MetLife sent Medina the entire case file. Medina's\n\nclaim on appeal is that because this file did not contain the\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\frequested transmission confirmation sheet (the fax itself was\n\nproduced), MetLife is liable for sanctions under § 1132.\n\n              Medina's conclusion is a non sequitur. First, the remedy\n\nhe    seeks   is   not    available     for     his   alleged   grievance.      The\n\nsubstantive requirement that MetLife furnish requested documents\n\nafter a denial of a claim is located in § 1133, which obligates\n\ninsurance     plans      to   \"afford    a    reasonable   opportunity     to   any\n\nparticipant whose claim for benefits has been denied for a full and\n\nfair review by the appropriate named fiduciary of the decision\n\ndenying the claim.\"            29 U.S.C. § 1133(2); see also 29 C.F.R.\n\n§ 2560.503-1(h)(2)(iii) (delineating requirements for a \"full and\n\nfair review\").        It is well established that a violation of § 1133\n\nand    its    implementing      regulations       does   not    trigger   monetary\n\nsanctions under § 1132(c).              See, e.g., Wilczynski v. Lumbermens\n\nMut. Cas. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"724918\"><a href=\"/opinion/724918/pens-plan-guide-p-23925i-faith-wilczynski-v-lumbermens-mutual-casualty/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">397</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 406 (7th Cir. 1996); Sturhlreyer v.\n\nArmco, Inc. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 79(6th Cir. 1993); Groves v.

Sanctions are therefore\n\nunavailable here.\n\n              Second, even if sanctions were available, we see no foul\n\nthat would merit them.            Section 1133's implementing regulation\n\nprovides:\n\n              [T]he claims procedures of a plan will not be\n              deemed to provide a claimant with a reasonable\n              opportunity for a full and fair review of a\n              claim and adverse benefit determination unless\n              the claims procedures . . . [p]rovide that a\n              claimant shall be provided, upon request and\n\n                                         -13-\n\f            free of charge, reasonable access to, and\n            copies of, all documents, records, and other\n            information relevant to the claimant's claim\n            for benefits.\n\n29 C.F.R. § 2560.503-1(h)(2)(iii).       MetLife, which mailed the\n\nentire claim file a week after receiving Medina's request, more\n\nthan   sufficiently   met   the   regulation's   \"reasonable   access\"\n\nstandard.   Although Medina demands a fax transmission confirmation\n\nin addition to the fax itself, there is no reason to think that\n\nsuch a document was ever part of the file, and its absence is not\n\na violation.\n\n                        III. Attorney's Fees\n\n            Finally, Medina argues that the district court erred in\n\nnot awarding him attorney's fees.    \"[W]e will disturb such rulings\n\nonly if the record persuades us that the trial court indulged in a\n\nserious lapse in judgment.\"        Twomey v.

Because we conclude\n\nthat Medina does not prevail on any of his substantive claims, we\n\naffirm the district court's denial of Medina's request for fee-\n\nshifting.\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\f</pre>",
