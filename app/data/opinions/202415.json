Levin, Assistant Federal Public Defendant, for\nappellant.\n     Aixa Maldonado-Quiñones, Assistant United States Attorney,\nwith whom Thomas P. Colantuono, United States Attorney, was on\nbrief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          September 15, 2006\n\f           CYR, Senior Circuit Judge.               At 5 p.m. on February 3,\n\n2004, New Hampshire State Trooper Greg Ferry observed appellant\n\nWawa Bell’s vehicle, with its four-way flashers blinking, parked in\n\nthe   breakdown   lane     of   Highway     I-93    in   Salem,     Massachusetts.\n\nTrooper Ferry pulled his cruiser behind Bell’s vehicle to offer\n\nassistance.    Approaching the driver’s side window, Trooper Ferry\n\nobserved that Bell was sleeping, and tapped on the rolled-up\n\nwindow.   Bell awakened, rolled the window all the way down, and\n\ninformed Trooper Ferry that his car had broken down. Bell declined\n\nassistance from Trooper Ferry, however, stating that the car\n\nprobably would restart if he let it sit for a couple of minutes.\n\nTrooper Ferry asked to see Bell's license and registration in order\n\nto fill out a routine “checkup slip,” which the State Police use to\n\nkeep a record of patrolling officers’ contacts with motorists.\n\nBell stated that the car was not registered in his name, but he\n\nwould try to find the registration.           As Bell leaned over toward the\n\nglove   compartment,     Trooper      Ferry    bent      down    and   trained   his\n\nflashlight    into   the    vehicle    in     the   direction       of   the   glove\n\ncompartment.      Glancing downward, Trooper Ferry observed, on the\n\ndriver’s side door armrest, a clear plastic straw with white powder\n\nresidue on its tip, and a folded dollar bill.                   Trooper Ferry then\n\nshone the flashlight on the armrest, at which point Bell became\n\nvisibly nervous, and placed his wallet on top of the straw.                    Based\n\nupon his law enforcement experience, Trooper Ferry concluded that\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fthe white powder was an illegal substance, and placed Bell under\n\narrest. During the ensuing search of Bell’s person incident to the\n\narrest, Trooper Ferry found a bag of cocaine, and a subsequent\n\ninventory search of the vehicle disclosed crack cocaine, marijuana,\n\nand assorted drug paraphernalia.\n\n          Following his one-count indictment for possession of\n\ncocaine base with intent to distribute, 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1), Bell\n\nsubmitted a motion to suppress the evidence seized during and after\n\nhis arrest, contending, inter alia, that Trooper Ferry had violated\n\nhis Fourth Amendment rights when he stuck his head into the window\n\nof the car in order to observe the driver’s side door armrest.   At\n\nthe suppression hearing, Trooper Ferry testified as follows on\n\ncross-examination:\n\n          Q:   At this point when you look down, are you\n               standing outside the vehicle?\n          A:   Yes, I am.\n          Q:   And is your head inside the vehicle?\n          A:   I don’t believe it’s inside the vehicle.\n               I was adjacent to the vehicle, the\n               driver’s door.\n          Q:   Did you put your head in the window?\n          A:   It   may   have  been   in  the   window.\n               Obviously I was looking in the glove box.\n          Q:   So that your head may have been inside\n               the window?\n          A:   I wasn’t sticking my head inside the car\n               if that’s what you’re saying.\n          Q:   Right.   But when you look down and see\n               something in the door handle, are you –\n          A:   My head’s at the window. I bent down.\n          Q:   So is your head partially where the\n               window would have been, let’s say?\n          A:   Yeah, it could have been.\n\n(Emphasis added.).    Denise Babbitt, Bell’s fiancee, testified\n\n                               -3-\n\fregarding several photographs she had taken of the vehicle after\n\nBell's arrest, purporting to demonstrate that a person standing\n\noutside the driver’s side window could not have seen the armrest\n\nunless his head partially intruded past the plane where the rolled-\n\nup window would have been.\n\n          The district court denied the suppression motion, noting:\n\n          Did he see those items in plain view? . . . I\n          find that he did. There was no evidence that\n          [Trooper Ferry] stuck his head inside the car.\n          He testified specifically that he did not. . .\n          . Was he at the window?     He was.    Was the\n          straw and the means of transporting the\n          narcotics visible to him in plain view from\n          outside the car at the window? It was.\n\nThe district court found the Babbitt photographs “unhelpful because\n\nthey’re not taken from the right vantage points.”   The court later\n\nstated:\n\n          If you’re suggesting that your case is going\n          to turn on, did two millimeters of [Trooper\n          Ferry’s] forehead skin pass within one micron\n          of the inside surface of the window had it\n          been up, I can’t help you there. I can’t make\n          that   discrete  a   finding   based  on  the\n          transcript that you have given me or the\n          evidence you have presented.\n\nIn due course, Bell entered a conditional guilty plea reserving the\n\nright to appeal from the denial of his suppression motion, which he\n\nnow exercises.\n\n          On appeal, Bell reiterates his contention that Trooper\n\nFerry admitted that his head partially intruded inside the window\n\nof the vehicle, and since Trooper Ferry did not observe the\n\n\n                               -4-\n\fcontraband on the armrest from a lawful vantage, the search is not\n\nsustainable under the plain view doctrine.\n\n          We review the denial of a suppression motion under a\n\nbifurcated    standard,   assessing    the   district   court's   legal\n\nconclusions de novo, and its subsidiary findings of fact for clear\n\nerror.   See United States v. Mahler, 454 F.3d 13, 17 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).   We accord considerable deference to the district court’s\n\nassessments of witness credibility, see United States v. Ivery, 427\n\nF.3d 69, 72 (1st Cir. 2005), cert. denied, 126 S. Ct. 1448 (2006),\n\nand view all evidence and reasonable inferences therefrom in the\n\nlight most favorable to the government, see United States v. Cook,\n\n277 F.3d 82, 84 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n          The government justifies Trooper Ferry’s seizure of the\n\ncontraband from the Bell vehicle's armrest pursuant to the “plain\n\nview doctrine,” which validates a seizure where “(1) the seizing\n\npolice officer lawfully reached the position from which he could\n\nsee the item in plain view; (2) the seizure satisfied the probable\n\ncause standard; and (3) the seizing officer had a ‘lawful right of\n\naccess to the object itself.’”    United States v. Antrim, 389 F.3d\n\n276, 283 (1st Cir. 2004) (citation omitted), cert. denied, 544 U.S.\n\n936 (2005).   Bell’s argument relates only to the first criterion,\n\nsince he maintains that the record compels a finding that Trooper\n\nFerry’s head intruded into his car past the boundary where the\n\ndriver’s side window would have been had the window been rolled up.\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fFor present purposes, we shall assume, without deciding, that\n\nBell’s demarcation of an imaginary line, where the rolled-up window\n\nwould have been, has legal significance under the \"plain view\"\n\ndoctrine.    However, whether Trooper Ferry leaned into the Bell\n\nvehicle before observing the contraband is a quintessential issue\n\nof fact.1        We discern no clear error in the district court's\n\nnegative response.\n\n            The district court explicitly credited Trooper Ferry’s\n\ntestimony that he “wasn’t sticking [his] head inside the car.” The\n\nensuing testimony, during which Trooper Ferry stated that his head\n\nwas “at” the window, may simply connote that he bent down outside\n\nthe window, so that his face was level with it.               Plainly, it need\n\nnot connote that Trooper Ferry's head was “in” the space which\n\nwould be occupied by the rolled-up window.               Trooper Ferry then\n\nsuggested simply that his head “could have been” “where the window\n\nwould have been.”        It did not state that his head was where the\n\nwindow would have been.\n\n            As    the   district    court    aptly   noted,   the   suppression\n\nhearing produced no evidence upon which the court reliably might\n\nhave determined the precise location of the trooper’s head before\n\nhe viewed the contraband.          Nor was any other eyewitness testimony\n\n\n\n     1\n      Bell concedes that Trooper Ferry’s use of a flashlight to\nilluminate inside the vehicle from the outside did not constitute\na Fourth Amendment “search.” See Texas v. Brown, 460 U.S. 730,\n739-40 (1983).\n\n                                       -6-\n\fpresented.        Bell nevertheless invites us to engage in hyper-\n\ntechnicality, unaccompanied by any statistical evidence from which\n\nthe court independently might have ascertained the question, such\n\nas the trooper’s height, exact location in relation to the driver’s\n\nside door, or the dimensions of the vehicle or the driver’s side\n\nwindow.    Tellingly, Bell has not included his fiancee’s photos of\n\nthe vehicle in the appellate record, thereby effectively conceding\n\nthe district court’s finding that the photos were “unhelpful.”\n\nPlainly then, in these particular circumstances, it was not clear\n\nerror for the district court to credit the testimony that Trooper\n\nFerry “wasn’t sticking [his] head inside the car.”               See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Stanfield, 109 F.3d 976, 979 n.1 (4th Cir. 1997)\n\n(deferring to police officer’s version of his location during\n\n“plain    view”    seizure   inside   vehicle).   As   Trooper   Ferry   was\n\nlawfully positioned outside the Bell vehicle, the ensuing seizure\n\nof the contraband from the driver’s side armrest was valid.              See\n\nAntrim, 389 F.3d at 283.2\n\n\n\n     2\n      None of Bell’s other arguments on appeal deserve extended\ndiscussion. The contention that the trooper’s observation of the\ncontraband did not provide him with “probable cause” to make the\narrest is belied by the record evidence: Trooper Ferry, an officer\nwith ten years’ law enforcement experience, justifiably could\nconclude that the straw with white powder, the folded currency (a\ncommon mode of transporting illegal drugs), see, e.g., United\nStates v. Pittman, 418 F.3d 704, 708 (7th Cir. 2005), and Bell’s\nsudden nervousness and attempt to hide the contraband, provided\nmore than adequate basis to arrest Bell on suspicion of drug\npossession.   Accordingly, the Bell challenge to the post-arrest\ninventory search of the vehicle is likewise without merit.\n\n                                      -7-\n\fAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n            -8-\n\f",

Antrim, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201351\"><a href=\"/opinion/201351/united-states-v-antrim/\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">276</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 283 (1st Cir. 2004) (citation omitted), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">936</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2005).   Bell’s argument relates only to the first criterion,\n\nsince he maintains that the record compels a finding that Trooper\n\nFerry’s head intruded into his car past the boundary where the\n\ndriver’s side window would have been had the window been rolled up.\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fFor present purposes, we shall assume, without deciding, that\n\nBell’s demarcation of an imaginary line, where the rolled-up window\n\nwould have been, has legal significance under the \"plain view\"\n\ndoctrine.    However, whether Trooper Ferry leaned into the Bell\n\nvehicle before observing the contraband is a quintessential issue\n\nof fact.1        We discern no clear error in the district court's\n\nnegative response.\n\n            The district court explicitly credited Trooper Ferry’s\n\ntestimony that he “wasn’t sticking [his] head inside the car.” The\n\nensuing testimony, during which Trooper Ferry stated that his head\n\nwas “at” the window, may simply connote that he bent down outside\n\nthe window, so that his face was level with it.               Plainly, it need\n\nnot connote that Trooper Ferry's head was “in” the space which\n\nwould be occupied by the rolled-up window.               Trooper Ferry then\n\nsuggested simply that his head “could have been” “where the window\n\nwould have been.”        It did not state that his head was where the\n\nwindow would have been.\n\n            As    the   district    court    aptly   noted,   the   suppression\n\nhearing produced no evidence upon which the court reliably might\n\nhave determined the precise location of the trooper’s head before\n\nhe viewed the contraband.          Nor was any other eyewitness testimony\n\n\n\n     1\n      Bell concedes that Trooper Ferry’s use of a flashlight to\nilluminate inside the vehicle from the outside did not constitute\na Fourth Amendment “search.” See Texas v. Brown, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110901\"><a href=\"/opinion/110901/texas-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">730</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n739-40 (1983).\n\n                                       -6-\n\fpresented.        Bell nevertheless invites us to engage in hyper-\n\ntechnicality, unaccompanied by any statistical evidence from which\n\nthe court independently might have ascertained the question, such\n\nas the trooper’s height, exact location in relation to the driver’s\n\nside door, or the dimensions of the vehicle or the driver’s side\n\nwindow.    Tellingly, Bell has not included his fiancee’s photos of\n\nthe vehicle in the appellate record, thereby effectively conceding\n\nthe district court’s finding that the photos were “unhelpful.”\n\nPlainly then, in these particular circumstances, it was not clear\n\nerror for the district court to credit the testimony that Trooper\n\nFerry “wasn’t sticking [his] head inside the car.”               See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Stanfield, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"738518\"><a href=\"/opinion/738518/united-states-v-billy-howard-stanfield/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">976</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 979 n.1 (4th Cir. 1997)\n\n(deferring to police officer’s version of his location during\n\n“plain    view”    seizure   inside   vehicle).   As   Trooper   Ferry   was\n\nlawfully positioned outside the Bell vehicle, the ensuing seizure\n\nof the contraband from the driver’s side armrest was valid.              See\n\nAntrim, 389 F.3d at 283.2\n\n\n\n     2\n      None of Bell’s other arguments on appeal deserve extended\ndiscussion. The contention that the trooper’s observation of the\ncontraband did not provide him with “probable cause” to make the\narrest is belied by the record evidence: Trooper Ferry, an officer\nwith ten years’ law enforcement experience, justifiably could\nconclude that the straw with white powder, the folded currency (a\ncommon mode of transporting illegal drugs), see, e.g., United\nStates v. Pittman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791392\"><a href=\"/opinion/791392/united-states-v-maurice-c-pittman/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">704</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 708 (7th Cir. 2005), and Bell’s\nsudden nervousness and attempt to hide the contraband, provided\nmore than adequate basis to arrest Bell on suspicion of drug\npossession.   Accordingly, the Bell challenge to the post-arrest\ninventory search of the vehicle is likewise without merit.\n\n                                      -7-\n\fAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n            -8-\n\f</pre>",
