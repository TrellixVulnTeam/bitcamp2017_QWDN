Paul J. Barbadoro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n                Lynch and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Jaye L. Rancourt, by appointment of the court, with whom\nBrennan Caron Lenehan & Iacopino was on brief for appellant.\n     Terry L. Ollila, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nThomas P. Colantuono, United States Attorney, was on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                          June 11, 2008\n\f            BOUDIN, Chief Judge.        On June 27, 2006, Timothy Boardman\n\npleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute heroin, 21\n\nU.S.C. § 846 (2000); he was thereafter sentenced to 84 months'\n\nimprisonment by the federal district court for New Hampshire.                     He\n\nnow appeals to contest his sentence.\n\n            Boardman    argues   that      his   two     prior     convictions   for\n\nburglary (of a warehouse and a garage, respectively) should not\n\nhave been considered predicate \"crimes of violence\" for purposes of\n\nthe   career    offender   provision       of    the    sentencing     guidelines,\n\nU.S.S.G. § 4B1.1, application of which substantially increased his\n\nguideline range.       He also argues that in any event, the district\n\njudge had--but mistakenly thought he did not have--the discretion\n\nto deviate from the guideline range based on his view that the\n\nprior felonies should not be so treated.\n\n            This court's decision in United States v. Fiore, 983 F.2d\n\n1 (1st Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 1024 (1993), held that\n\nnon-residential burglary is always a crime of violence under the\n\nguideline      in   question,   id.   at    4-5,       and   the    district   judge\n\nfaithfully applied that precedent in this case.                    However, we have\n\njust agreed, in another pending case, United States v. Giggey, No.\n\n07-2317, to reconsider en banc the holding of Fiore; were we to\n\ndecide to change course, a remand would be necessary here too.\n\nHowever, Giggey, in which further briefing is being sought, cannot\n\nbe argued and decided until the fall.\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f          In the meanwhile, if Boardman's alternative argument is\n\nright, then he is entitled to resentencing regardless of whether\n\nFiore is overturned.    See United States v. Rodriguez, 327 F.3d 52,\n\n54 (1st Cir. 2003).     Because of time already served before and\n\nafter the sentence was imposed, resentencing could result in a new\n\nsentence that would amount to immediate or imminent release.1   And\n\nbecause we think that the district judge has more authority than he\n\nthought even if Fiore stands, we think that a remand now serves the\n\ninterests of justice without awaiting the outcome of Giggey.\n\n          After Boardman was sentenced, the Supreme Court held in\n\nKimbrough v. United States, 128 S. Ct. 558 (2007), that district\n\njudges may deviate from the guidelines even on the basis of\n\ncategorical policy disagreements with its now-advisory provisions.\n\nIn Kimbrough, the disagreement was with the crack to cocaine ratio\n\nset forth in the guidelines, see id. at 570; here, the district\n\njudge's comments at the sentencing hearing suggest disagreement\n\nwith this court's interpretation of the guidelines in Fiore to\n\ninclude non-residential burglary as a predicate for the career\n\noffender enhancement.\n\n          The district court properly recognized that it was bound\n\nby Fiore to treat the guideline as we had interpreted it; but we do\n\n\n     1\n      Although his current sentence is 84 months and was imposed\nonly in December 2006, he had by then already been held for a\nsubstantial period, normally credited against the sentence, and\nsought in district court a sentence of approximately 32 months. He\nhas already served more than 32 months.\n\n                                 -3-\n\fnot see why disagreement with the Commission's policy judgment (as\n\nexpressed in the guideline as we interpreted it in Fiore) would be\n\nany less permissible a reason to deviate than disagreement with the\n\nguideline policy judgment at issue in Kimbrough.                   The district\n\ncourt, of course, had no reason to anticipate Kimbrough's approach\n\nwhich overturned or called into question various rulings of this\n\ncourt and other circuits assuming that such guideline policy\n\njudgments were binding.\n\n          Of     course    the   district    court    is   still   required    to\n\ncalculate and consider the guidelines range.                 United States v.\n\nJimenez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 518-19 (1st Cir. 2006) (en banc),\n\ncert. denied, 127 S. Ct. 928 (2007).              But because it has broader\n\nfreedom that it did before Kimbrough and there is some explicit\n\nindication that it might well alter its sentence in light of that,\n\nwe think a remand is warranted to permit the court to make its own\n\ndecision now informed by Kimbrough.               Rodriguez, 327 F.3d at 54.\n\nThis is so regardless of how Giggey is ultimately decided.\n\n          The government responds that the district court knew it\n\nhad discretion, and in fact exercised it by varying downward by\n\nalmost 50 months (from a guideline range of 140-175 months).                  But\n\nthe question is discretion to deviate on what grounds, and we think\n\nthe   district     court     (without       the    benefit    of    Kimbrough's\n\nclarification) underestimated what it was entitled to do.                     The\n\njudge explicitly said that \"if on appeal the Circuit believes that\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fI should have greater discretion . . . then I would go back and\n\nsentence the defendant to 33 months.\"             The government insists that\n\nin fact the judge, if given the chance would not do so as long as\n\nFiore stands, but we prefer to let him make that decision.\n\n             The district court may, of course, wish to postpone\n\nresentencing until after the en banc court decides Giggey; if so,\n\nit   might    or     might    not   wish     to   release   Boardman   pending\n\nresentencing.      Nothing in our decision is intended to suggest that\n\na lesser sentence should be imposed or that Boardman should be\n\nreleased now, either definitively or provisionally. Our concern is\n\nthat the district judge consider such issues with the additional\n\nlatitude furnished by Kimbrough.\n\n             The sentence is vacated and the matter remanded to the\n\ndistrict     court    for    further   proceedings     consistent   with   this\n\ndecision.\n\n             It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\f",
