Carmen Consuelo Cerezo, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n                          Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                         Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n                  and Keenan,* Senior District Judge.\n\n\n\n     Elfrick Mendez-Morales, by appointment of the court, on brief\nfor appellant.\n     Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, Chief,\nAppellate Division, and Rosa Emilia Rodriguez-Velez, United States\nAttorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                             March 19, 2008\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.\n\f              BOUDIN, Chief Judge.         Justina Ayala-Tapia traveled by\n\novernight     ferry   from    the   Dominican    Republic    to   Puerto   Rico,\n\narriving at the Mayaguez port on February 1, 2006.                       Customs\n\nofficials searched her luggage after an x-ray scan raised their\n\nsuspicions; they discovered four heavily wrapped packages which,\n\naccording to a field test and a drug-sniffing dog, contained\n\nnarcotics.      Later testing confirmed the presence of approximately\n\n3.5 kilograms of heroin.\n\n              Ayala told the officials that the packages were given to\n\nher by a friend in the Dominican Republic, to be delivered to a man\n\nnamed Miguel waiting outside the port.            She agreed to participate\n\nin a controlled delivery but Miguel, perhaps tipped off by the\n\ndelay   (or    perhaps    a   fictitious     character),    did   not   show   up.\n\nThereafter, Ayala was indicted on one count of importing, and one\n\ncount of possessing with intent to distribute, the controlled\n\nsubstance heroin.        21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 952(a) (2000).\n\n              She went to trial in Puerto Rico's federal district court\n\nin April 2006. The government called the customs officials who had\n\nsearched Ayala's bag, discovered the packages and conducted the\n\nfield test; the parties stipulated to the weight and purity of the\n\nheroin.   The government also presented expert evidence from a DEA\n\nagent about the street value of the seized heroin and the methods\n\nused to smuggle drugs onto the island.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\f           Ayala testified as the only witness in her defense.   She\n\ndid not dispute that she had possessed the heroin but denied that\n\nshe knew the packages contained the drug.    She said that a friend\n\nnamed Ivelisse had asked her to bring the packages to Ivelisse's\n\nbrother Miguel in Puerto Rico. Ayala claimed that she believed the\n\npackages to contain coffee and flour, possibly for use in Miguel's\n\nbakery.   She was to meet him outside the port and, in exchange, he\n\nwould give her a ride to the San Juan airport, from where she would\n\nfly back to her residence in New York.\n\n           Ayala explained that she would frequently travel to the\n\nDominican Republic via Puerto Rico because her son lived in the\n\nformer and her mother in the latter.     She also claimed to earn a\n\nliving by buying clothing in New York and selling it in the\n\nDominican Republic.   She supplied some further information about\n\nIvelisse but not about how to contact her and said that she had no\n\nfurther information about Miguel or how to reach him.\n\n           The jury returned convictions on both counts.         The\n\ndistrict judge denied Ayala's motion for judgment of acquittal,\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 29, and on November 2, 2006, sentenced her to the\n\nstatutory minimum (given the drug quantity) of 120 months in\n\nprison.   21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A).      The judge rejected Ayala's\n\nrequest to apply the \"safety valve\" exception to the mandatory\n\nminimum, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f) (2000); U.S.S.G. § 5C1.2; the judge\n\n\n\n\n                                -3-\n\ffound that Ayala had not met the requirement of truthfully telling\n\nthe government all she knew about the drug venture.\n\n           On appeal, Ayala first contests the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence to support her convictions.            Only one element of the\n\ncrimes--whether Ayala possessed the drugs \"knowingly\"--is at issue;\n\nif Ayala knowingly possessed the heroin, the large quantity itself\n\nprovides the basis for an inference of intent to distribute.\n\nUnited States v. Echeverri, 982 F.2d 675, 678 (1st Cir. 1993).           If\n\nshe truly believed that the packages contained flour or coffee,\n\nthen she committed no crime.        We consider de novo whether the\n\ngovernment presented evidence from which a rational jury could\n\nconclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Ayala knew she was carrying\n\ndrugs.   United States v. Mateos-Sanchez, 864 F.2d 232, 238 (1st\n\nCir. 1988).\n\n           As is common in drug courier prosecutions, there was no\n\ndirect   evidence   of   what   Ayala   knew;   whether   the   jury   could\n\nreasonably infer knowledge depends, as common sense would suggest,\n\non the surrounding facts and circumstances.        Compare United States\n\nv. Barbosa, 906 F.2d 1366, 1368 (9th Cir.) (\"[M]ere possession of\n\na substantial quantity of drugs may be sufficient to support an\n\ninference of knowing possession.\"), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 961\n\n(1990), with United States v. Jackson, 55 F.3d 1219, 1226 (6th\n\nCir.) (if drugs are found in \"hidden compartment\" then additional\n\nevidence is necessary), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 926 (1995).\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\f           The government points to a number of factors that make\n\nthe finding of guilty knowledge plausible in this case.                    As the\n\ngovernment    expert    testified    at     trial,   the    drugs   had   a   very\n\nsubstantial     street     value--approximately            $300,000--and      drug\n\nsuppliers might be unwilling to entrust such valuable cargo to an\n\nignorant     courier,    fearing    that    she   might     be   insufficiently\n\nmotivated to ensure that it safely reaches its destination.                    We\n\nhave acknowledged that this is a reasonable inference.                     United\n\nStates v. Thomas, 467 F.3d 49, 54 (1st Cir. 2006) (smugglers opt\n\n\"for trusted and close associates . . . who are aware of the high\n\nstakes\"), cert. denied, 127 S. Ct. 1850 (2007); see also United\n\nStates v. Rodriguez, 192 F.3d 946, 950 (10th Cir. 1999) (collecting\n\ncases).1\n\n           Ayala acknowledged placing the packages in her luggage;\n\nthis is not a case of a hidden compartment or the professed\n\nsurprise discovery of items packed by another.               See United States\n\nv. Diaz-Carreon, 915 F.2d 951, 954 (5th Cir. 1990).                   The heavy\n\nwrapping made it impossible to tell what was inside, but that could\n\neasily cut against Ayala's story in the jury's mind; why would\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      The opposite inference is also possible, see United States v.\nDel Aguila-Reyes, 722 F.2d 155, 158 (5th Cir. 1983) (Rubin, J.,\ndissenting) (noting that \"dupes who are unaware that they carry\nvaluable cargo are less likely to steal it\"); but the jury has\nleeway in considering which inference is more persuasive on given\nfacts.\n\n                                      -5-\n\fflour or coffee be packaged in such a strange fashion?   Here, it is\n\nthe circumstances of this case that work against the defendant.\n\n          Further, Ayala testified at trial; and \"the jury is\n\npermitted to draw an inference of guilt from a deliberate false\n\nalibi.\"   United States v. Llinas, 373 F.3d 26, 37 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(concurring opinion).   The prosecutor's cross examination gave the\n\njury a series of reasons to believe that Ayala was lying:\n\n                 ! she had never met Miguel before but\n          planned to meet him outside the port and\n          accept a ride to San Juan;\n\n                 ! she did not know Miguel's last name\n          or phone number, or Ivelisse's phone number;\n\n                 ! she initially claimed to have told\n          the customs officials that the packages\n          contained coffee, but later admitted that she\n          had told them it was flour for baking cakes;\n          and\n\n                 ! her explanation for her roundabout\n          route between the Dominican Republic and New\n          York was attacked as implausible for a variety\n          of reasons.\n\n          The jury might also have been skeptical that anyone would\n\nbother to transport a few kilograms of coffee or flour to Puerto\n\nRico, especially in light of that island's own famous, historic\n\ncoffee industry.   See Dooley v. United States, 182 U.S. 222, 236\n\n(1901) (\"[Puerto Rico] had no manufactures or markets of its own,\n\nand was dependent upon the markets of other countries for the sale\n\nof her productions of coffee, sugar and tobacco.\").\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f                   The jury is entitled to evaluate the witnesses, including\n\nAyala, and could fairly have concluded that she lacked credibility.\n\nFrom        that    determination,     especially       in     combination      with    the\n\ncircumstantial evidence described above, an inference of guilt and\n\na conviction may follow.              Thomas, 467 F.3d at 55 (\"Ultimately, it\n\nis   [defendant's]           own   trial    testimony    that    seals    her    fate    on\n\nappeal.\"); Llinas, 373 F.3d at 37 (concurring opinion).\n\n                   The same reasoning largely resolves Ayala's sentencing\n\nchallenge as well.             Under the so-called safety valve provision, 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3553(f), defendants convicted of certain drug crimes who\n\nmeet five requirements are to be sentenced \"without regard to any\n\nstatutory          minimum     sentence.\"      Id.      Ayala    might    have    been    a\n\ncandidate for this leniency but the court found that she failed the\n\nfifth        prong,     i.e.    the   requirement       that    \"the     defendant      has\n\ntruthfully provided to the Government all information and evidence\n\nthe defendant has concerning the offense.\"                     Id. § 3553(f)(5).2\n\n                   Ayala did offer to tell the government what she knew, but\n\nindicated that she would simply repeat her trial testimony.                          Given\n\nthat the jury had necessarily disbelieved Ayala's story, there was\n\nsome speculation during the sentencing hearing as to whether the\n\ndistrict judge was required to find that Ayala had failed the fifth\n\n\n        2\n      The other requirements are that the defendant not (i) have\nmore than one criminal history point; (ii) have engaged in violence\nor possessed a gun; (iii) have participated in activity leading to\ndeath or serious injury; or (iv) have been a leader of the criminal\nenterprise. 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f)(1)-(4).\n\n                                             -7-\n\fprong    of   the   safety    valve   statute.          Ultimately,     the   court\n\nexplicitly rested on its own, independent finding that Ayala's\n\nstory was not true, and we review that factual determination only\n\nfor clear error.     United States v. Stark, 499 F.3d 72, 80 (1st Cir.\n\n2007).\n\n              For the same reasons that the jury could reasonably have\n\ndisbelieved     Ayala's      testimony    when       assessing    her   guilt,    the\n\ndistrict court could reasonably reach the same conclusion in its\n\nsafety valve determination. United States v. Marquez, 280 F.3d 19,\n\n24-25 (1st Cir. 2002).         Ayala emphasizes that she cooperated with\n\nthe   government    by    agreeing,      at    the    time   of   the   arrest,   to\n\nparticipate in a controlled delivery to Miguel.                   But the statute\n\ncalls for a particular form of cooperation--truthful disclosure--\n\nand the judge permissibly concluded that Ayala had not complied.\n\n              Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\f",

Customs\n\nofficials searched her luggage after an x-ray scan raised their\n\nsuspicions; they discovered four heavily wrapped packages which,\n\naccording to a field test and a drug-sniffing dog, contained\n\nnarcotics.      Later testing confirmed the presence of approximately\n\n3.5 kilograms of heroin.\n\n              Ayala told the officials that the packages were given to\n\nher by a friend in the Dominican Republic, to be delivered to a man\n\nnamed Miguel waiting outside the port.            She agreed to participate\n\nin a controlled delivery but Miguel, perhaps tipped off by the\n\ndelay   (or    perhaps    a   fictitious     character),    did   not   show   up.\n\nThereafter, Ayala was indicted on one count of importing, and one\n\ncount of possessing with intent to distribute, the controlled\n\nsubstance heroin.        21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 952(a) (2000).\n\n              She went to trial in Puerto Rico's federal district court\n\nin April 2006.

She said that a friend\n\nnamed Ivelisse had asked her to bring the packages to Ivelisse's\n\nbrother Miguel in Puerto Rico. Ayala claimed that she believed the\n\npackages to contain coffee and flour, possibly for use in Miguel's\n\nbakery.   She was to meet him outside the port and, in exchange, he\n\nwould give her a ride to the San Juan airport, from where she would\n\nfly back to her residence in New York.\n\n           Ayala explained that she would frequently travel to the\n\nDominican Republic via Puerto Rico because her son lived in the\n\nformer and her mother in the latter.     She also claimed to earn a\n\nliving by buying clothing in New York and selling it in the\n\nDominican Republic.

The prosecutor's cross examination gave the\n\njury a series of reasons to believe that Ayala was lying:\n\n                 ! she had never met Miguel before but\n          planned to meet him outside the port and\n          accept a ride to San Juan;\n\n                 ! she did not know Miguel's last name\n          or phone number, or Ivelisse's phone number;\n\n                 ! she initially claimed to have told\n          the customs officials that the packages\n          contained coffee, but later admitted that she\n          had told them it was flour for baking cakes;\n          and\n\n                 ! her explanation for her roundabout\n          route between the Dominican Republic and New\n          York was attacked as implausible for a variety\n          of reasons.\n\n          The jury might also have been skeptical that anyone would\n\nbother to transport a few kilograms of coffee or flour to Puerto\n\nRico, especially in light of that island's own famous, historic\n\ncoffee industry.   See Dooley v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"95502\"><a href=\"/opinion/95502/dooley-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">182</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">222</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 236\n\n(1901) (\"[Puerto Rico] had no manufactures or markets of its own,\n\nand was dependent upon the markets of other countries for the sale\n\nof her productions of coffee, sugar and tobacco.\").\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f                   The jury is entitled to evaluate the witnesses, including\n\nAyala, and could fairly have concluded that she lacked credibility.\n\nFrom        that    determination,     especially       in     combination      with    the\n\ncircumstantial evidence described above, an inference of guilt and\n\na conviction may follow.              Thomas, 467 F.3d at 55 (\"Ultimately, it\n\nis   [defendant's]           own   trial    testimony    that    seals    her    fate    on\n\nappeal.\"); Llinas, 373 F.3d at 37 (concurring opinion).\n\n                   The same reasoning largely resolves Ayala's sentencing\n\nchallenge as well.             Under the so-called safety valve provision, 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3553(f), defendants convicted of certain drug crimes who\n\nmeet five requirements are to be sentenced \"without regard to any\n\nstatutory          minimum     sentence.\"      Id.      Ayala    might    have    been    a\n\ncandidate for this leniency but the court found that she failed the\n\nfifth        prong,     i.e.    the   requirement       that    \"the     defendant      has\n\ntruthfully provided to the Government all information and evidence\n\nthe defendant has concerning the offense.\"                     Id. § 3553(f)(5).2\n\n                   Ayala did offer to tell the government what she knew, but\n\nindicated that she would simply repeat her trial testimony.                          Given\n\nthat the jury had necessarily disbelieved Ayala's story, there was\n\nsome speculation during the sentencing hearing as to whether the\n\ndistrict judge was required to find that Ayala had failed the fifth\n\n\n        2\n      The other requirements are that the defendant not (i) have\nmore than one criminal history point; (ii) have engaged in violence\nor possessed a gun; (iii) have participated in activity leading to\ndeath or serious injury; or (iv) have been a leader of the criminal\nenterprise. 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f)(1)-(4).\n\n                                             -7-\n\fprong    of   the   safety    valve   statute.          Ultimately,     the   court\n\nexplicitly rested on its own, independent finding that Ayala's\n\nstory was not true, and we review that factual determination only\n\nfor clear error.
