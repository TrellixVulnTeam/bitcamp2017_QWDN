Rya W. Zobel, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                          Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                and Torruella and Dyk*, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n          Tamara J.

This case, including an appeal and\n\na cross-appeal, involves a dispute between two insurance companies.\n\nThe dispute concerns their respective responsibilities to pay\n\ndefense and settlement costs relating to injuries to Richard Leahy\n\nand Philip Sheehan, two workmen employed by K.C. Electric Company,\n\nInc.   (“K.C.    Electric”).        K.C.     Electric     was   a   subcontractor\n\nperforming work for S.A. Healy/Modern Continental (“S.A. Healy”),\n\na   prime    contractor,    on   the   Deer    Island     Tunnel    Project   (the\n\n“Project”).      Resolution of this dispute requires us to interpret\n\ntwo insurance policies.             The first policy was issued to the\n\nsubcontractor by Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Company (“Lumbermens”),\n\nand the second policy was issued to the prime contractor by\n\nNational Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\n\n(“National Union”).\n\n             As to the first policy, the question is whether the\n\nLumbermens      policy,    though    issued    to   the   subcontractor,      also\n\nprovided coverage to the prime contractor in the circumstances of\n\nthis case and, hence, to the prime contractor’s subrogee, National\n\nUnion.      The second question is whether the National Union policy\n\nprovided only excess coverage.         If both policies covered the prime\n\ncontractor in these circumstances, the companies would divide the\n\nliabilities; if the Lumbermens policy applied, and if the National\n\nUnion policy provided only excess coverage, Lumbermens was solely\n\nresponsible.\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\f           We conclude that the Lumbermens policy covered the prime\n\ncontractor, but that genuine issues of material fact exist as to\n\nwhether the National Union policy provided only excess coverage.\n\nWe thus vacate the district court’s judgment and remand for further\n\nproceedings.\n\n                                     I\n\n           Leahy and Sheehan, who were employees of K.C. Electric,\n\nwere injured on the site of the Project when they slipped and fell\n\nwhile they were in the tunnel. They filed separate actions against\n\nS.A. Healy, claiming that they incurred their injuries as a result\n\nof S.A. Healy’s negligence in failing to maintain a safe work site.\n\nBoth actions were settled before trial; Lumbermens and National\n\nUnion each contributed to the settlement payments.         National Union\n\nthen   instituted   two   actions   in    the   district   court,   seeking\n\ndeclarations that (1) S.A. Healy was an “additional insured” under\n\nthe Lumbermens policy, obligating Lumbermens at least to share in\n\nthe defense and settlement costs, and (2) that the National Union\n\npolicy was in excess of the Lumbermens policy pursuant to the\n\npolicies’ respective “other insurance” provisions, thus making\n\nLumbermens entirely liable for the defense and settlement costs.\n\nNational Union moved for summary judgment in both cases.                The\n\nparties agree that the policies are interpreted in accordance with\n\nMassachusetts law.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f            The   district    court   denied      National   Union’s   summary\n\njudgment motions in two nearly identical opinions issued on the\n\nsame day.   Nat’l Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Lumbermen’s Mut. Cas. Ins.\n\nCo., No. 02-10876-RWZ (D. Mass. Oct. 1, 2003) (“Leahy”); Nat’l\n\nUnion Fire Ins. Co. v. Lumbermen’s Mut. Cas. Ins. Co., No. 02-CV-\n\n12001-RWZ (D. Mass. Oct. 1, 2003) (“Sheehan”). First, the district\n\ncourt held that S.A. Healy qualified as an additional insured under\n\nthe Lumbermens policy.       Leahy, slip op. at 3; Sheehan, slip op. at\n\n3.   Second, the district court held that both National Union and\n\nLumbermens were primary carriers, that is, that the National Union\n\npolicy was not an excess coverage policy.             Leahy, slip op. at 5;\n\nSheehan, slip op. at 5.      In addition, in the case involving Leahy,\n\nthe district court held that, because both Lumbermens’ and National\n\nUnion’s   policies    provided   for    contribution     by    equal   shares,\n\n“National   Union    and   Lumbermen’s      are    equally    liable   for   the\n\nsettlement.”      Leahy, slip op. at 5.\n\n            Thus, the district court held that National Union could\n\nnot recover the portions of the settlement payments that it had\n\npaid, effectively granting summary judgment to Lumbermens on the\n\nexcess coverage issue, and effectively granting summary judgment to\n\nNational Union on the additional insured issue.              See generally 10A\n\nCharles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice & Procedure § 2720, at\n\n347 (3d ed. 1998) (“[S]ummary judgment may be rendered in favor of\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fthe opposing party even though the opponent has made no formal\n\ncross-motion under Rule 56.”).\n\n          On joint motion of the parties, the district court\n\nsubsequently entered final judgments pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n54(b) in accordance with its earlier decisions.   Nat’l Union Fire\n\nIns. Co. v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Ins. Co., No. 02CV10876 RWZ (D.\n\nMass. Jan. 21, 2004); Nat’l Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Lumbermens Mut.\n\nCas. Ins. Co., No. 02-CV-12001-RWZ (D. Mass. Dec. 31, 2003).   The\n\nparties appealed and cross-appealed from those judgments.\n\n                                 II\n\n                                  A\n\n          We first consider whether the Lumbermens policy covered\n\nS.A. Healy as an additional insured.      We review the district\n\ncourt’s effective grant of summary judgment in favor of National\n\nUnion without deference, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor\n\nof the non-moving party.   Beacon Mut. Ins. Co. v. OneBeacon Ins.\n\nGroup, 376 F.3d 8, 14 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n          The subcontract between S.A. Healy and K.C. Electric\n\nrequired K.C. Electric to obtain commercial general liability\n\ninsurance, among other insurance, and to name S.A. Healy as an\n\nadditional insured on its commercial general liability insurance\n\npolicy.   K.C. Electric obtained its commercial general liability\n\npolicy from Lumbermens for the period between August 8, 1997, and\n\nAugust 8, 1998.   The policy was thus in effect when Leahy and\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fSheehan incurred their injuries on August 26, 1997, and November\n\n18, 1997, respectively.\n\n          As was required by the subcontract, the Lumbermens policy\n\nobtained by K.C. Electric included an additional insured provision,\n\nwhich added the following paragraph to the “WHO IS AN INSURED”\n\nsection of the policy:\n\n          Any person or organization to whom or to which\n          you are obligated by virtue of a written\n          contract, agreement or permit to provide such\n          insurance as afforded by this policy is an\n          [additional] insured, but only with respect to\n          liability arising out of:\n          a.     \"Your work\" for that insured by you\n          . . . .\n\n(App. at 71.)    The policy further defined “your work” as “[w]ork or\n\noperations    performed    by    you   or       on   your    behalf;    and   .     .   .\n\n[m]aterials, parts or equipment furnished in connection with such\n\nwork or operations.”      (App. at 75.)          Thus, the policy covered only\n\n“liability     arising    out    of    .    .    .   work”     performed      by     the\n\nsubcontractor for the contractor.\n\n             The district court held that S.A. Healy qualified as an\n\nadditional    insured    under   the       Lumbermens       policy,    even   if     the\n\nemployees were not actually engaged in work at the time they were\n\ninjured because “K.C. employees cannot perform their work unless,\n\nof course, they can reach and leave their workplaces on the job\n\nsite.”   Leahy, slip op. at 3; Sheehan, slip op. at 3.                             Thus,\n\nbecause the injuries were “incurred while on the job site,” the\n\ndistrict court held that the “work” requirement of the additional\n\n                                       -6-\n\finsured provision was satisfied.                 Leahy, slip op. at 3; Sheehan,\n\nslip op. at 3.\n\n                                            B\n\n             This court considered nearly identical policy language in\n\nMerchants Insurance Co. of New Hampshire v. United States Fidelity\n\n& Guaranty Co., 143 F.3d 5 (1st Cir. 1998).                  There, the court held\n\nthat “under Massachusetts law the phrase ‘arising out of’ denotes\n\na   level   of    causation      that    lies    between     proximate     and    actual\n\ncausation.”         Id. at 9.           However, the court did not further\n\ndelineate     this      “intermediate      causation”        standard    because,     in\n\nMerchants     Insurance,        “the     harm    occurred     while     [the     injured\n\nemployee] was cutting and removing a section of the bridge, a task\n\nthat was assigned to [the subcontractor] in the Sherman’s Bridge\n\nproject.”         Id.     Because the harm occurred while the injured\n\nemployee was actually performing work for the subcontractor, the\n\nfact that the subcontractor did not proximately cause the injury\n\n(which was caused by the negligence of an employee of the primary\n\ncontractor) was irrelevant.              The court held: “More than ‘but for’\n\ncausation existed.            It was not simply because the two companies\n\nhappened to be working in the same location that [the injured\n\nemployee] was injured by [the primary contractor’s] employee;\n\nrather,     the    injury     was   a   consequence     of    the   work   that    [the\n\nsubcontractor]          was   performing.”        Id.   at    9-10.      This     causal\n\n\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\fconnection was sufficient to satisfy the intermediate causation\n\nstandard.   Id. at 10.\n\n            The issue here is whether there is a sufficient nexus\n\nbetween the injuries incurred by Leahy and Sheehan and their work\n\nfor K.C. Electric to satisfy the Merchants Insurance intermediate\n\ncausation standard.1     The parties dispute whether the summary\n\n\n     1\n           National Union claims that the “majority rule” is that an\nemployee’s mere presence on a work site is sufficient to invoke\nliability under such an additional insured provision.          (Pl.-\nAppellant’s/Cross-Appellee’s Rep. Br. at 22-27.) However, most of\nthe cases National Union cites for this proposition apply a less\nstringent standard of causation than the intermediate causation\nrequired by Merchants Insurance. See Admiral Ins. Co. v. Trident\nNGL, Inc., 988 S.W.2d 451, 454 (Tex. App. 1999) (“The majority view\n. . . is that for liability to ‘arise out of operations’ of a named\ninsured it is not necessary for the named insured’s acts to have\n‘caused’ the accident; rather, it is sufficient that the named\ninsured’s employee was injured while present at the scene in\nconnection with performing the named insured’s business, even if\nthe cause of the injury was the negligence of the additional\ninsured.”); Acceptance Ins. Co. v. Syufy Enters., 81 Cal. Rptr. 2d\n557, 561 (Cal. Ct. App. 1999) (“California courts have consistently\ngiven a broad interpretation to the terms ‘arising out of’ or\n‘arising from’ in various kinds of insurance provisions. It is\nsettled that this language does not import any particular standard\nof causation or theory of liability into an insurance policy.\nRather, it broadly links a factual situation with the event\ncreating liability, and connotes only a minimal causal connection\nor incidental relationship.”); Shell Oil Co. v. AC & S, Inc., 649\nN.E.2d 946, 952 (Ill. App. Ct. 1995) (“[The injured employee’s]\ninjuries appear to have arisen from the operations of [the\nsubcontractor] and [the contractor] on plaintiff’s premises. The\ninjuries would not have occurred ‘but for’ [the injured employee’s]\nemployment by [the contractor] and [the contractor’s] presence on\nplaintiff’s premises.”); Md. Cas. Co. v. Chicago & N.W. Transp.\nCo., 466 N.E.2d 1091, 1094 (Ill. App. Ct. 1984) (“[T]he instant\ninjuries appear to have arisen from the operation and use of the\nleased premises, since they would not have been sustained ‘but for’\nthe victim’s employment on those premises.”); see also Highland\nPark Shopping Vill. v. Trinity Universal Ins. Co., 36 S.W.3d 916,\n918 (Tex. App. 2001) (adopting the same causation standard as\n\n                                -8-\n\fjudgment record establishes that Leahy and Sheehan themselves were\n\nengaged in “work” in accordance with the policy when they were\n\ninjured.    Leahy testified by deposition that he was injured while\n\nhe was walking through the tunnel toward a man lift that would take\n\nhim to the surface. National Union contends that Leahy was working\n\nat the time of his accident, but Lumbermens asserts that Leahy was\n\ngoing to    lunch.      Leahy   testified   that     the   accident   occurred\n\n“approximately right around lunchtime,” but he also testified that\n\nhe was in the tunnel to check the mine phones and to see if two\n\nK.C. Electric electricians were having any problems wiring pumps in\n\nthe tunnel.     (App. at 214-15.)         Similarly, the parties dispute\n\nwhether Sheehan was working at the time of his accident.               In his\n\nanswers to interrogatories, Sheehan stated that he was “performing”\n\nhis duties “at the time [he was] injured,” but he also stated that\n\nhis “specific purpose” at the time was “going to [his] job to\n\nperform    electrical   maintenance,      repairs,    installations,     etc.”\n\n(App. at 281, 284.)      National Union thus alleges that Sheehan was\n\n\n\nAdmiral Insurance).\n          Other cases have adopted a site rule without addressing\nthe causation standard. See O’Connor v. Serge Elevator Co., 444\nN.E.2d 982, 983 (N.Y. 1982) (holding that an employee’s injuries\n“must be deemed as a matter of law to have arisen out of the work”\nunder an indemnity clause when the employee was injured “while\nleaving his workplace for lunch”); Farren v. General Motors Corp.,\n708 F. Supp. 436, 449 (D. Mass. 1989) (concluding that the phrase\n“in connection with the work attributable to the Contractor” in an\nindemnity clause “was intended by the parties to cover injuries\nsustained by an employee . . . returning to his work site from a\nlunch break”).\n\n                                    -9-\n\fworking when he was injured, while Lumbermens argues that he was\n\nmerely traveling to his actual work location at the time of the\n\ninjury.\n\n          Even if Leahy and Sheehan were not actually performing\n\nsubcontractor work at the time of their accidents, the record is\n\nclear that the subcontractor’s work was performed at various places\n\nthroughout the tunnel, and, thus, at the time of their accidents,\n\nthe   employees     were    within     the     general    area    where      the\n\nsubcontractor’s work was performed.             Leahy testified that his\n\n“regular routine” was to travel throughout the tunnel, ensuring\n\nthat lights were working properly, and that “basically [his] time\n\nwas spent walking from the access points [for the tunnel] to the\n\nelectricians and back,” talking to the electricians, and testing\n\nthe phones.   (App. at 215-16.)        Similarly, Sheehan testified that\n\nhis usual duties were to “perform[] tunnel maintenance, repair[]\n\nlights, carry[] tools and cable, etc.”            (App. at 281.)       We hold\n\nthat the policy’s requirements were satisfied because the employees\n\nwere injured within the general area where the subcontractor’s work\n\nwas being performed, and their presence there was directly related\n\nto their work obligations, even if the employees were merely\n\ntraveling to or from work or to or from a lunch break.\n\n          The     purpose   of   the   “your    work”    clause   is   not    to\n\ndifferentiate between those employees who were actually engaged in\n\nwork on a particular task when they were injured, as opposed to\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fthose who were idle or moving about the job site; rather, the\n\nprovision is at least designed to cover injuries incurred in\n\ntraversing   the   work    area     for     which   the   subcontractor      was\n\nresponsible for performing work, that is, the subcontractor’s\n\ngeneral work area.    Requiring the employee actually to have been\n\nengaged in work would lead to artificial distinctions between\n\nemployees who are performing specific tasks versus those traversing\n\nthe subcontractor’s general work area, waiting for instructions, or\n\neven   pausing   between   tasks.         Accordingly,    we   hold   that   the\n\nintermediate causation standard of Merchants Insurance is satisfied\n\nwhere the employee was injured within the general work area where\n\nthe subcontractor’s work was being performed, so long as his\n\npresence was work-related. The additional insured provision in the\n\nLumbermens policy thus applies to S.A. Healy in this case.             We need\n\nnot, therefore, decide whether coverage exists simply because the\n\ninjury occurred on the prime contractor’s work site.\n\n           The court in McCarthy Brothers Co. v. Continental Lloyds\n\nInsurance Co., 7 S.W.3d 725 (Tex. App. 1999), was faced with a\n\nsimilar situation.    In McCarthy, the injured employee slipped and\n\nfell as he was walking down an incline to get tools to perform his\n\nwork from a trailer belonging to the subcontractor for which he\n\nworked “on the premises of” the construction site.                Id. at 730.\n\nThe court relied on Merchants Insurance and held that “[t]here was\n\nmore than a mere locational relationship between the injury and\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\f[the injured employee’s] presence on the site” because the employee\n\nwas within the subcontractor’s general work area “for the purpose\n\nof     carrying        out    [the    subcontractor’s]     contract    with     [the\n\ncontractor].”          Id.2\n\n                 The   case    on    which    Lumbermens   primarily   relies    is\n\nfactually distinguishable. In Pro Con Construction, Inc. v. Acadia\n\nInsurance Co., 794 A.2d 108 (N.H. 2002), the injured employee, a\n\npainter employed by a subcontractor, was injured when he slipped\n\nand fell on an icy sidewalk as he was walking to a coffee truck\n\nparked in the parking lot outside the building in which he was\n\npainting.        Id. at 109.     He sued the prime contractor, alleging that\n\nit had negligently failed to keep the sidewalk clear of snow and\n\nice.       Id.   As in Merchants Insurance, the court required more than\n\n“but for” causation, but the court held that there was no nexus\n\nbetween the painting operations and the injuries because “[t]he\n\ninjuries did not occur while the employee was engaged in any task\n\nrelated      to    [the]      painting   operations   or   near   [the]   painting\n\noperations.”           Id. at 110 (citation omitted). In Pro Con, the\n\npainter left the area in which Decorative Concepts’ work was being\n\nperformed to get coffee from the coffee truck.

In contrast, the\n\nemployees here, even if they were not actually performing work,\n\nremained in the subcontractor’s general work area.3\n\n                                     III\n\n                                      A\n\n            The second issue in this case involves interpretation of\n\nthe National Union policy.     The National Union policy included an\n\n“Other Insurance” provision, which provided that the National Union\n\npolicy was primary (not excess) except in three situations not\n\npertinent here.   (The Lumbermens policy also included an identical\n\nprovision   providing   that   the    Lumbermens    policy   was   primary.)\n\nHowever, National Union alleges that, in the policy it issued to\n\nS.A. Healy, the “Other Insurance” provision was superseded by an\n\nendorsement bearing the same date as the policy that was found in\n\nthe policy’s underwriting file.           That endorsement provides:\n\n                               ENDORSEMENT\n\n            This Endorsement effective 12/31/95 12:01 A.M.\n            FORMS A PART OF POLICY NO. GL 817-67-02 ISSUED\n\n\n     3\n          Lumbermens also argues that we should construe the policy\nto bar coverage because Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 29C bars a\ngeneral   contractor  from   securing   an   indemnity   from   its\nsubcontractor “for injury to persons or damage to property not\ncaused by the subcontractor or its employees, agents or\nsubcontractors.” Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 29C (2004). However,\nsection 29C does not apply to insurance policies, and the policy\nconsiderations reflected in section 29C are not applicable to such\npolicies. See, e.g., Johnson v. Modern Cont’l Constr. Co., 731\nN.E.2d 96, 99 (Mass. App. Ct. 2000) (“We do not consider coverage\nquestions under an insurance contract analogous to coverage under\nan indemnity provision of a construction contract.”).\n\n                                     -13-\n\f          TO S.A.

However, the policy itself does not refer to the\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fendorsement.   The policy’s declaration page does not expressly\n\nincorporate any endorsements; it provides: “ENDORSEMENTS ATTACHED\n\nTO THIS POLICY: SEE ATTACHED SCHEDULE.”      (App. at 9.)   The attached\n\n“FORMS SCHEDULE” includes a list of forms and endorsements, but the\n\nendorsement at issue here is not among the endorsements on the\n\nlist. The endorsement thus is not incorporated by reference in the\n\npolicy.\n\n           Accordingly, relying on the integration clause in the\n\npolicy4 and the policy’s representation that “[t]he statements in\n\nthe   Declarations   are   accurate   and   complete,”   (App.   at   19),\n\nLumbermens argued that the endorsement was parol evidence that\n\ncould not be considered in defining the scope of the National Union\n\npolicy.   See, e.g., Bank v. Int’l Bus. Machs. Corp., 145 F.3d 420,\n\n424 (1st Cir. 1998) (“In Massachusetts, ‘[t]he parol evidence rule\n\nprecludes evidence of earlier or contemporaneous discussions that\n\nwould modify the provisions of a later integrated agreement which\n\nthe proponent of the agreement seeks to enforce.’” (quoting New\n\nEngland Fin. Res., Inc. v. Coulouras, 566 N.E.2d 1136, 1139 (Mass.\n\nApp. Ct. 1991)) (alteration in original)); ITT Corp. v. LTX Corp.,\n\n926 F.2d 1258, 1261 (1st Cir. 1991) (“Under Massachusetts law,\n\nparol evidence may not be admitted to contradict the clear terms of\n\n\n      4\n          The integration clause provides: “This policy contains\nall the agreements between you and us concerning the insurance\nafforded. . . . This policy’s terms can be amended or waived only\nby endorsement issued by us and made a part of the policy.” (App.\nat 57.)\n\n                                 -15-\n\fan   agreement,   or   to   create     ambiguity   where   none   otherwise\n\nexists.”).\n\n           The district court agreed.        It found that “the relevant\n\nendorsement is not listed on the declaration page or the attached\n\nschedule of included forms, and therefore, is not part of the\n\npolicy.”   Leahy, slip op. at 4; Sheehan, slip op. at 4.          Thus, the\n\ndistrict court held, because of the policy’s integration clause,\n\nthe endorsement could not be considered.           Leahy, slip op. at 4;\n\nSheehan, slip op. at 4.      In accordance with the standard “Other\n\nInsurance” provision, the court thus held that both parties were\n\nprimary carriers.      Leahy, slip op. at 5; Sheehan, slip op. at 5.\n\n                                       B\n\n             We conclude that there are genuine issues of material\n\nfact as to whether the endorsement forms a part of the policy, and\n\nthat summary judgment was improper.\n\n             National Union correctly notes that the policy must be\n\nconstrued as a whole.        See, e.g., Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co. v.\n\nSpecial Olympics Int’l, Inc., 346 F.3d 259, 261 (1st Cir. 2003)\n\n(“An insurance policy is to be read as a whole without according\n\nundue emphasis to any particular part over another.” (quoting\n\nMission Ins. Co. v. U.S. Fire Ins. Co., 517 N.E.2d 463, 466 (Mass.\n\n1988)) (internal quotation marks omitted)).         However, the question\n\nis, what is the whole policy?        We think that the mere fact that the\n\nmain body of the policy contains no reference to the endorsement\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fdoes not, in and of itself, conclusively establish that the main\n\npolicy and the endorsement are not part of a single document.5\n\n          Further evidence is needed (apart from the endorsement\n\nlanguage itself) concerning whether the endorsement formed a part\n\nof the policy.   For example, if the endorsement were physically\n\nattached to the policy when transmitted to the insured, such a\n\nphysical connection could indicate that the endorsement formed a\n\npart of the policy:\n\n          It is the general rule that an endorsement or\n          rider attached to an insurance policy becomes\n          and forms a part of the contract; that the\n          policy and the endorsement or rider shall be\n          construed together; and that where the\n          provisions in the body of the policy and those\n          in   the   endorsement   or   rider   are   in\n          irreconcilable    conflict   the    provisions\n          contained in the endorsement or rider will\n          prevail over those contained in the body of\n          the policy.\n\nFarmers Ins. Exch. v. Ledesma, 214 F.2d 495, 498 (10th Cir. 1954);\n\nsee also, e.g., Blevio v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 39 F.3d 1, 2 (1st\n\nCir. 1994) (considering an endorsement attached to an insurance\n\npolicy along with the policy); Petrowski v. Hawkeye-Security Ins.\n\nCo., 237 F.2d 609, 610 (7th Cir. 1956) (“All three documents,\n\n\n     5\n          There is no contention here that the endorsement can form\na stand-alone contract. Cf. Fairfield 274-278 Clarendon Trust v.\nDwek, 970 F.2d 990, 992 (1st Cir. 1992) (determining which of\nseveral stand-alone contracts was the operative contract between\nthe parties). Nor is there any contention that the endorsement\nconstituted a later amendment to the policy.        Therefore, the\npolicy’s provision that “[t]his policy’s terms can be amended or\nwaived only by endorsement issued by us and made a part of the\npolicy” is irrelevant. (App. at 57.)\n\n                               -17-\n\fpolicy,   declarations,      and   special   endorsement,        were    stapled\n\ntogether and comprised one unit when issued.”); see also Rumsfeld\n\nv.   Freedom   NY,   Inc.,   346   F.3d   1359,   1361   (Fed.    Cir.   2003);\n\nRestatement (Second) of Contracts § 132 (1981) (stating that, for\n\npurposes of the Statute of Frauds, a contract “may consist of\n\nseveral writings if one of the writings is signed and the writings\n\nin the circumstances clearly indicate that they relate to the same\n\ntransaction”); id. cmt. c (“It is sufficient . . . that the party\n\nto be charged physically attaches one document to the other or\n\nencloses them in the same envelope.”).\n\n           The summary judgment filings by the parties here only\n\nconcern the state of National Union’s underwriting files, not the\n\npolicy documents received by the insured.                It is thus unclear\n\nwhether the main policy and the endorsement were stapled together\n\nas sent by National Union and as received by the insured.                     In\n\naddition, there may be other evidence, including evidence of\n\nindustry practice, that might show that the endorsement and the\n\npolicy were parts of the same document.             Without a more fully-\n\ndeveloped record, we must vacate the district court’s effective\n\ngrant of summary judgment for Lumbermens and remand this case to\n\nthe district court for further proceedings.6\n\n\n      6\n          Lumbermens also notes that the endorsement at issue lists\nthe policy number as “GL 817-67-02,” (App. at 46), whereas the\nendorsements listed in the forms schedule consistently use the\npolicy number “GL 817-67-02 RA,” (E.g., App. at 23 (emphasis\nadded).). We attach no significance to this minor inconsistency.\n\n                                     -18-\n\f                                IV\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that S.A. Healy is\n\nan additional insured pursuant to the Lumbermens policy.   However,\n\nwe cannot determine on this record whether the National Union\n\npolicy provided only excess coverage.   Accordingly, we vacate the\n\ndistrict court’s judgment, and we remand to the district court for\n\nfurther proceedings.\n\n          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -19-\n\f",

The dispute concerns their respective responsibilities to pay defense and settlement costs relating to injuries to Richard Leahy and Philip Sheehan, two workmen employed by K.C. Electric Company, Inc. (\"K.C.Electric\"). K.C. Electric was a subcontractor performing work for S.A. Healy/Modern Continental (\"S.A.Healy\"), a prime contractor, on the Deer Island Tunnel Project (the \"Project\"). Resolution of this dispute requires us to interpret two insurance policies. The first policy was issued to the subcontractor by Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Company (\"Lumbermens\"), and the second policy was issued to the prime contractor by National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (\"National Union\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the first policy, the question is whether the Lumbermens policy, though issued to the subcontractor, also provided coverage to the prime contractor in the circumstances of this case and, hence, to the prime contractor's subrogee, National Union. The second question is whether the National Union policy provided only excess coverage. If both policies covered the prime contractor in these circumstances, the companies would divide the liabilities; if the Lumbermens policy applied, and if the National Union policy provided only excess coverage, Lumbermens was solely responsible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the Lumbermens policy covered the prime contractor, but that genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether the National Union policy provided only excess coverage. We thus vacate the district court's judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* Leahy and Sheehan, who were employees of K.C. Electric, were injured on the site of the Project when they slipped and fell while they were in the tunnel. They filed separate actions against S.A. Healy, claiming that they incurred their injuries as a result of S.A. Healy's negligence in failing to maintain a safe work site. Both actions were settled before trial; Lumbermens and National Union each contributed to the settlement payments. National Union then instituted two actions in the district court, seeking declarations that (1) S.A. Healy was an \"additional insured\" under the Lumbermens policy, obligating Lumbermens at least to share in the defense and settlement costs, and (2) that the National Union policy was in excess of the Lumbermens policy pursuant to the policies' respective \"other insurance\" provisions, thus making Lumbermens entirely liable for the defense and settlement costs. National Union moved for summary judgment in both cases. The parties agree that the policies are interpreted in accordance with Massachusetts law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied National Union's summary judgment motions in two nearly identical opinions issued on the same day. <i>Nat'l Union Fire Ins.

Oct. 1, 2003) (\"<i>Sheehan</i>\"). First, the district court held that S.A. Healy qualified as an additional insured under the Lumbermens policy. <i>Leahy,</i> slip op. at 3; <i>Sheehan,</i> slip op. at 3. Second, the district court held that both National Union and Lumbermens were primary carriers, that is, that the National Union policy was not an excess coverage policy. <i>Leahy,</i> slip op. at 5; <i>Sheehan,</i> slip op. at 5. In addition, in the case involving Leahy, the district court held that, because both Lumbermens' and National Union's policies provided for contribution by equal shares, \"National Union and Lumbermen's are equally liable for the settlement.\" <i>Leahy,</i> slip op. at 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the district court held that National Union could not recover the portions of the settlement payments that it had paid, effectively granting summary judgment to Lumbermens on the excess coverage issue, and effectively granting summary judgment to National Union on the additional insured issue. <i>See generally</i> 10A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Mary Kay Kane, <i>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure</i> &#167; 2720, at 347 (3d ed. 1998) (\"[S]ummary judgment may be rendered in favor of the opposing party even though the opponent has made no formal cross-motion under Rule 56.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On joint motion of the parties, the district court subsequently entered final judgments pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b) in accordance with its earlier decisions. <i>Nat'l Union Fire Ins.

Electric required K.C. Electric to obtain commercial general liability insurance, among other insurance, and to name S.A. Healy as an additional insured on its commercial general liability insurance policy. K.C. Electric obtained its commercial general liability policy from Lumbermens for the period between August 8, 1997, and August 8, 1998. The policy was thus in effect when Leahy and Sheehan incurred their injuries on August 26, 1997, and November 18, 1997, respectively.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As was required by the subcontract, the Lumbermens policy obtained by K.C.

The policy further defined \"your work\" as \"[w]ork or operations performed by you or on your behalf; and ...

There, the court held that \"under Massachusetts law the phrase `arising out of' denotes a level of causation that lies between proximate and actual causation.\" <i>Id.</i> at 9. However, the court did not further delineate this \"intermediate causation\" standard because, in <i>Merchants Insurance,</i>\"the harm occurred while [the injured employee] was cutting and removing a section of the bridge, a task that was assigned to [the subcontractor] in the Sherman's Bridge project.\" <i>Id.</i> Because the harm occurred while the injured employee was actually performing work for the subcontractor, the fact that the subcontractor did not proximately cause the injury (which was caused by the negligence of an employee of the primary contractor) was irrelevant. The court held: \"More than `but for' causation existed. It was not simply because the two companies happened to be working in the same location that [the injured employee] was injured by [the primary contractor's] employee; rather, the injury was a consequence of the work that [the subcontractor] was performing.\" <i>Id.</i> at 9-10. This causal connection was sufficient to satisfy the intermediate causation standard. <i>Id.</i> at 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue here is whether there is a sufficient nexus between the injuries incurred by Leahy and Sheehan and their work for K.C. Electric to satisfy the <i>Merchants</i> <i>Insurance</i> intermediate causation standard.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The parties dispute whether the summary judgment record establishes that Leahy and Sheehan themselves were engaged in \"work\" in accordance with the policy when they were injured. Leahy testified by deposition that he was injured while he was walking through the tunnel toward a man lift that would take him to the surface. National Union contends that Leahy was working at the time of his accident, but Lumbermens asserts that Leahy was going to lunch. Leahy testified that the accident occurred \"approximately right around lunchtime,\" but he also testified that he was in the tunnel to check the mine phones and to see if two K.C. Electric electricians were having any problems wiring pumps in the tunnel. (App. at 214-15.) Similarly, the parties dispute whether Sheehan was working at the time of his accident. In his answers to interrogatories, Sheehan stated that he was \"performing\" his duties \"at the time [he was] injured,\" but he also stated that his \"specific purpose\" at the time was \"going to [his] job to perform electrical maintenance, repairs, installations, etc.\" (App. at 281, 284.) National Union thus alleges that Sheehan was working when he was injured, while Lumbermens argues that he was merely traveling to his actual work location at the time of the injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if Leahy and Sheehan were not actually performing subcontractor work at the time of their accidents, the record is clear that the subcontractor's work was performed at various places throughout the tunnel, and, thus, at the time of their accidents, the employees were within the general area where the subcontractor's work was performed. Leahy testified that his \"regular routine\" was to travel throughout the tunnel, ensuring that lights were working properly, and that \"basically [his] time was spent walking from the access points [for the tunnel] to the electricians and back,\" talking to the electricians, and testing the phones. (App. at 215-16.) Similarly, Sheehan testified that his usual duties were to \"perform[ ] tunnel maintenance, repair[ ] lights, carry[ ] tools and cable, etc.\" (App. at 281.) We hold that the policy's requirements were satisfied because the employees were injured within the general area where the subcontractor's work was being performed, and their presence there was directly related to their work obligations, even if the employees were merely traveling to or from work or to or from a lunch break.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The purpose of the \"your work\" clause is not to differentiate between those employees who were actually engaged in work on a particular task when they were injured, as opposed to those who were idle or moving about the job site; rather, the provision is at least designed to cover injuries incurred in traversing the work area for which the subcontractor was responsible for performing work, that is, the subcontractor's general work area. Requiring the employee actually to have been engaged in work would lead to artificial distinctions between employees who are performing specific tasks versus those traversing the subcontractor's general work area, waiting for instructions, or even pausing between tasks. Accordingly, we hold that the intermediate causation standard of <i>Merchants Insurance</i> is satisfied where the employee was injured within the general work area where the subcontractor's work was being performed, so long as his presence was work-related. The additional insured provision in the Lumbermens policy thus applies to S.A. Healy in this case. We need not, therefore, decide whether coverage exists simply because the injury occurred on the prime contractor's work site.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court in <i>McCarthy Brothers Co. v. Continental Lloyds Insurance Co.,</i> 7 S.W.3d 725 (Tex.App.1999), was faced with a similar situation. In <i>McCarthy,</i> the injured employee slipped and fell as he was walking down an incline to get tools to perform his work from a trailer belonging to the subcontractor for which he worked \"on the premises of\" the construction site. <i>Id.</i> at 730. The court relied on <i>Merchants Insurance</i> and held that \"[t]here was more than a mere locational relationship between the injury and [the injured employee's] presence on the site\" because the employee was within the subcontractor's general work area \"for the purpose of carrying out [the subcontractor's] contract with [the contractor].\" <i>Id.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case on which Lumbermens primarily relies is factually distinguishable. In <i>Pro Con Construction, Inc. v. Acadia Insurance Co.,</i> 147 N.H. 470, 794 A.2d 108 (2002), the injured employee, a painter employed by a subcontractor, was injured when he slipped and fell on an icy sidewalk as he was walking to a coffee truck parked in the parking lot outside the building in which he was painting. <i>Id.</i> at 109. He sued the prime contractor, alleging that it had negligently failed to keep the sidewalk clear of snow and ice. <i>Id.</i> As in <i>Merchants</i> <i>Insurance,</i> the court required more than \"but for\" causation, but the court held that there was no nexus between the painting operations and the injuries because \"[t]he injuries did not occur while the employee was engaged in any task related to [the] painting operations or near [the] painting operations.\" <i>Id.</i> at 110 (citation omitted). In <i>Pro Con,</i> the painter left the area in which Decorative Concepts' work was being performed to get coffee from the coffee truck. He was thus injured outside the general work area in which the subcontractor was performing work and was not \"near\" that area. In contrast, the employees here, even if they were not actually performing work, remained in the subcontractor's general work area.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* The second issue in this case involves interpretation of the National Union policy. The National Union policy included an \"Other Insurance\" provision, which provided that the National Union policy was primary (not excess) except in three situations not pertinent here. (The Lumbermens policy also included an identical provision providing that the Lumbermens policy was primary.) However, National Union alleges that, in the policy it issued to S.A. Healy, the \"Other Insurance\" provision was superseded by an endorsement bearing the same date as the policy that was found in the policy's underwriting file. That endorsement provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>ENDORSEMENT</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Endorsement effective 12/31/95 12:01 A.M.

However, the policy itself does not refer to the endorsement. The policy's declaration page does not expressly incorporate any endorsements; it provides: \"ENDORSEMENTS ATTACHED TO THIS POLICY: SEE ATTACHED SCHEDULE.\" (App. at 9.) The attached \"FORMS SCHEDULE\" includes a list of forms and endorsements, but the endorsement at issue here is not among the endorsements on the list. The endorsement thus is not incorporated by reference in the policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, relying on the integration clause in the policy<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and the policy's representation that \"[t]he statements in the Declarations are accurate and complete,\" (App. at 19), Lumbermens argued that the endorsement was parol evidence that could not be considered in defining the scope of the National Union policy. <i>See, e.g., Bank v. Int'l Bus. Machs. Corp.,</i> 145 F.3d 420, 424 (1st Cir.1998) (\"In Massachusetts, `[t]he parol evidence rule precludes evidence of earlier or contemporaneous discussions that would modify the provisions of a later integrated agreement which the proponent of the agreement seeks to enforce.'\" (quoting <i>New England Fin. Res., Inc. v. Coulouras,</i> 30 Mass.App.Ct. 140, 566 N.E.2d 1136, 1139 (1991)) (alteration in original)); <i>ITT Corp. v. LTX Corp.,</i> 926 F.2d 1258, 1261 (1st Cir.1991) (\"Under Massachusetts law, parol evidence may not be admitted to contradict the clear terms of an agreement, or to create ambiguity where none otherwise exists.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court agreed. It found that \"the relevant endorsement is not listed on the declaration page or the attached schedule of included forms, and therefore, is not part of the policy.\" <i>Leahy,</i> slip op. at 4; <i>Sheehan,</i> slip op. at 4. Thus, the district court held, because of the policy's integration clause, the endorsement could not be considered. <i>Leahy,</i> slip op. at 4; <i>Sheehan,</i> slip op. at 4. In accordance with the standard \"Other Insurance\" provision, the court thus held that both parties were primary carriers. <i>Leahy,</i> slip op. at 5; <i>Sheehan,</i> slip op. at 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether the endorsement forms a part of the policy, and that summary judgment was improper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">National Union correctly notes that the policy must be construed as a whole. <i>See, e.g., Fireman's Fund Ins. Co. v. Special Olympics Int'l, Inc.,</i> 346 F.3d 259, 261 (1st Cir.2003) (\"An insurance policy is to be read as a whole without according undue emphasis to any particular part over another.\" (quoting <i>Mission Ins. Co. v. U.S. Fire Ins. Co.,</i> 401 Mass. 492, 517 N.E.2d 463, 466 (1988)) (internal quotation marks omitted)). However, the question is, what is the whole policy? We think that the mere fact that the main body of the policy contains no reference to the endorsement does not, in and of itself, conclusively establish that the main policy and the endorsement are not part of a single document.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further evidence is needed (apart from the endorsement language itself) concerning whether the endorsement formed a part of the policy. For example, if the endorsement were physically attached to the policy when transmitted to the insured, such a physical connection could indicate that the endorsement formed a part of the policy:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is the general rule that an endorsement or rider attached to an insurance policy becomes and forms a part of the contract; that the policy and the endorsement or rider shall be construed together; and that where the provisions in the body of the policy and those in the endorsement or rider are in irreconcilable conflict the provisions contained in the endorsement or rider will prevail over those contained in the body of the policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Farmers Ins.

Co.,</i> 237 F.2d 609, 610 (7th Cir.1956) (\"All three documents, policy, declarations, and special endorsement, were stapled together and comprised one unit when issued.\"); <i>see also Rumsfeld v.

It is thus unclear whether the main policy and the endorsement were stapled together as sent by National Union and as received by the insured. In addition, there may be other evidence, including evidence of industry practice, that might show that the endorsement and the policy were parts of the same document. Without a more fully-developed record, we must vacate the district court's effective grant of summary judgment for Lumbermens and remand this case to the district court for further proceedings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that S.A.

Gen. Laws ch. 149, &#167; 29C (2004). However, section 29C does not apply to insurance policies, and the policy considerations reflected in section 29C are not applicable to such policies<i>See, e.g., Johnson v. Modern Cont'l Constr.

The first policy was issued to the subcontractor by Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Company (\"Lumbermens\"), and the second policy was issued to the prime contractor by National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (\"National Union\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the first policy, the question is whether the Lumbermens policy, though issued to the subcontractor, also provided coverage to the prime contractor in the circumstances of this case and, hence, to the prime contractor's subrogee, National Union. The second question is whether the National Union policy provided only excess coverage. If both policies covered the prime contractor in these circumstances, the companies would divide the liabilities; if the Lumbermens policy applied, and if the National Union policy provided only excess coverage, Lumbermens was solely responsible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the Lumbermens policy covered the prime contractor, but that genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether the National Union policy provided only excess coverage. We thus vacate the district court's judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* Leahy and Sheehan, who were employees of K.C. Electric, were injured on the site of the Project when they slipped and fell while they were in the tunnel. They filed separate actions against S.A. Healy, claiming that they incurred their injuries as a result of S.A. Healy's negligence in failing to maintain a safe work site. Both actions were settled before trial; Lumbermens and National Union each contributed to the settlement payments. National Union then instituted two actions in the district court, seeking declarations that (1) S.A. Healy was an \"additional insured\" under the Lumbermens policy, obligating Lumbermens at least to share in the defense and settlement costs, and (2) that the National Union policy was in excess of the Lumbermens policy pursuant to the policies' respective \"other insurance\" provisions, thus making Lumbermens entirely liable for the defense and settlement costs. National Union moved for summary judgment in both cases. The parties agree that the policies are interpreted in accordance with Massachusetts law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied National Union's summary judgment motions in two nearly identical opinions issued on the same day. <i>Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Lumbermen's Mut. Cas. Ins. Co.,</i> No. 02-10876-RWZ (D.Mass. Oct. 1, 2003) (\"<i>Leahy</i>\"); <i>Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Lumbermen's Mut. Cas. Ins. Co.,</i> No. 02-CV-12001-RWZ (D.Mass. Oct. 1, 2003) (\"<i>Sheehan</i>\"). First, the district court held that S.A. Healy qualified as an additional insured under the Lumbermens policy. <i>Leahy,</i> slip op. at 3; <i>Sheehan,</i> slip op. at 3. Second, the district court held that both National Union and Lumbermens were primary carriers, that is, that the National Union policy was not an excess coverage policy. <i>Leahy,</i> slip op. at 5; <i>Sheehan,</i> slip op. at 5. In addition, in the case involving Leahy, the district court held that, because both Lumbermens' and National Union's policies provided for contribution by equal shares, \"National Union and Lumbermen's are equally liable for the settlement.\" <i>Leahy,</i> slip op. at 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the district court held that National Union could not recover the portions of the settlement payments that it had paid, effectively granting summary judgment to Lumbermens on the excess coverage issue, and effectively granting summary judgment to National Union on the additional insured issue. <i>See generally</i> 10A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R.

Healy as an additional insured. We review the district court's effective grant of summary judgment in favor of National Union without deference, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party. <i>Beacon Mut. Ins. Co. v. Onebeacon Ins. Group,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">376</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></span>, 14 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The subcontract between S.A. Healy and K.C. Electric required K.C. Electric to obtain commercial general liability insurance, among other insurance, and to name S.A. Healy as an additional insured on its commercial general liability insurance policy. K.C. Electric obtained its commercial general liability policy from Lumbermens for the period between August 8, 1997, and August 8, 1998. The policy was thus in effect when Leahy and Sheehan incurred their injuries on August 26, 1997, and November 18, 1997, respectively.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As was required by the subcontract, the Lumbermens policy obtained by K.C. Electric included an additional insured provision, which added the following paragraph to the \"WHO IS AN INSURED\" section of the policy:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any person or organization to whom or to which you are obligated by virtue of a written contract, agreement or permit to provide such insurance as afforded by this policy is an [additional] insured, but only with respect to liability arising out of:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. \"Your work\" for that insured by you</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(App. at 71.) The policy further defined \"your work\" as \"[w]ork or operations performed by you or on your behalf; and ... [m]aterials, parts or equipment furnished in connection with such work or operations.\" (App. at 75.) Thus, the policy covered only \"liability arising out of ... work\" performed by the subcontractor for the contractor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held that S.A. Healy qualified as an additional insured under the Lumbermens policy, even if the employees were not actually engaged in work at the time they were injured because \"K.C. employees cannot perform their work unless, of course, they can reach and leave their workplaces on the job site.\" <i>Leahy,</i> slip op. at 3; <i>Sheehan,</i> slip op. at 3. Thus, because the injuries were \"incurred while on the job site,\" the district court held that the \"work\" requirement of the additional insured provision was satisfied. <i>Leahy,</i> slip op. at 3; <i>Sheehan,</i> slip op. at 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court considered nearly identical policy language in <i>Merchants Insurance Co. of New Hampshire v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197929\"><a href=\"/opinion/197929/merchants-insurance-v-guaranty-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">143</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1998). There, the court held that \"under Massachusetts law the phrase `arising out of' denotes a level of causation that lies between proximate and actual causation.\" <i>Id.</i> at 9. However, the court did not further delineate this \"intermediate causation\" standard because, in <i>Merchants Insurance,</i>\"the harm occurred while [the injured employee] was cutting and removing a section of the bridge, a task that was assigned to [the subcontractor] in the Sherman's Bridge project.\" <i>Id.</i> Because the harm occurred while the injured employee was actually performing work for the subcontractor, the fact that the subcontractor did not proximately cause the injury (which was caused by the negligence of an employee of the primary contractor) was irrelevant. The court held: \"More than `but for' causation existed. It was not simply because the two companies happened to be working in the same location that [the injured employee] was injured by [the primary contractor's] employee; rather, the injury was a consequence of the work that [the subcontractor] was performing.\" <i>Id.</i> at 9-10. This causal connection was sufficient to satisfy the intermediate causation standard. <i>Id.</i> at 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue here is whether there is a sufficient nexus between the injuries incurred by Leahy and Sheehan and their work for K.C. Electric to satisfy the <i>Merchants</i> <i>Insurance</i> intermediate causation standard.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The parties dispute whether the summary judgment record establishes that Leahy and Sheehan themselves were engaged in \"work\" in accordance with the policy when they were injured. Leahy testified by deposition that he was injured while he was walking through the tunnel toward a man lift that would take him to the surface. National Union contends that Leahy was working at the time of his accident, but Lumbermens asserts that Leahy was going to lunch. Leahy testified that the accident occurred \"approximately right around lunchtime,\" but he also testified that he was in the tunnel to check the mine phones and to see if two K.C. Electric electricians were having any problems wiring pumps in the tunnel. (App. at 214-15.) Similarly, the parties dispute whether Sheehan was working at the time of his accident. In his answers to interrogatories, Sheehan stated that he was \"performing\" his duties \"at the time [he was] injured,\" but he also stated that his \"specific purpose\" at the time was \"going to [his] job to perform electrical maintenance, repairs, installations, etc.\" (App. at 281, 284.) National Union thus alleges that Sheehan was working when he was injured, while Lumbermens argues that he was merely traveling to his actual work location at the time of the injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if Leahy and Sheehan were not actually performing subcontractor work at the time of their accidents, the record is clear that the subcontractor's work was performed at various places throughout the tunnel, and, thus, at the time of their accidents, the employees were within the general area where the subcontractor's work was performed. Leahy testified that his \"regular routine\" was to travel throughout the tunnel, ensuring that lights were working properly, and that \"basically [his] time was spent walking from the access points [for the tunnel] to the electricians and back,\" talking to the electricians, and testing the phones. (App. at 215-16.) Similarly, Sheehan testified that his usual duties were to \"perform[ ] tunnel maintenance, repair[ ] lights, carry[ ] tools and cable, etc.\" (App. at 281.) We hold that the policy's requirements were satisfied because the employees were injured within the general area where the subcontractor's work was being performed, and their presence there was directly related to their work obligations, even if the employees were merely traveling to or from work or to or from a lunch break.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The purpose of the \"your work\" clause is not to differentiate between those employees who were actually engaged in work on a particular task when they were injured, as opposed to those who were idle or moving about the job site; rather, the provision is at least designed to cover injuries incurred in traversing the work area for which the subcontractor was responsible for performing work, that is, the subcontractor's general work area. Requiring the employee actually to have been engaged in work would lead to artificial distinctions between employees who are performing specific tasks versus those traversing the subcontractor's general work area, waiting for instructions, or even pausing between tasks. Accordingly, we hold that the intermediate causation standard of <i>Merchants Insurance</i> is satisfied where the employee was injured within the general work area where the subcontractor's work was being performed, so long as his presence was work-related. The additional insured provision in the Lumbermens policy thus applies to S.A. Healy in this case. We need not, therefore, decide whether coverage exists simply because the injury occurred on the prime contractor's work site.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court in <i>McCarthy Brothers Co. v.

In <i>McCarthy,</i> the injured employee slipped and fell as he was walking down an incline to get tools to perform his work from a trailer belonging to the subcontractor for which he worked \"on the premises of\" the construction site. <i>Id.</i> at 730. The court relied on <i>Merchants Insurance</i> and held that \"[t]here was more than a mere locational relationship between the injury and [the injured employee's] presence on the site\" because the employee was within the subcontractor's general work area \"for the purpose of carrying out [the subcontractor's] contract with [the contractor].\" <i>Id.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case on which Lumbermens primarily relies is factually distinguishable.

Acadia Insurance Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">147</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">470</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">794</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">108</span></span> (2002), the injured employee, a painter employed by a subcontractor, was injured when he slipped and fell on an icy sidewalk as he was walking to a coffee truck parked in the parking lot outside the building in which he was painting. <i>Id.</i> at 109. He sued the prime contractor, alleging that it had negligently failed to keep the sidewalk clear of snow and ice. <i>Id.</i> As in <i>Merchants</i> <i>Insurance,</i> the court required more than \"but for\" causation, but the court held that there was no nexus between the painting operations and the injuries because \"[t]he injuries did not occur while the employee was engaged in any task related to [the] painting operations or near [the] painting operations.\" <i>Id.</i> at 110 (citation omitted). In <i>Pro Con,</i> the painter left the area in which Decorative Concepts' work was being performed to get coffee from the coffee truck. He was thus injured outside the general work area in which the subcontractor was performing work and was not \"near\" that area. In contrast, the employees here, even if they were not actually performing work, remained in the subcontractor's general work area.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* The second issue in this case involves interpretation of the National Union policy. The National Union policy included an \"Other Insurance\" provision, which provided that the National Union policy was primary (not excess) except in three situations not pertinent here. (The Lumbermens policy also included an identical provision providing that the Lumbermens policy was primary.) However, National Union alleges that, in the policy it issued to S.A. Healy, the \"Other Insurance\" provision was superseded by an endorsement bearing the same date as the policy that was found in the policy's underwriting file.

It is thus unclear whether the main policy and the endorsement were stapled together as sent by National Union and as received by the insured. In addition, there may be other evidence, including evidence of industry practice, that might show that the endorsement and the policy were parts of the same document. Without a more fully-developed record, we must vacate the district court's effective grant of summary judgment for Lumbermens and remand this case to the district court for further proceedings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that S.A.
