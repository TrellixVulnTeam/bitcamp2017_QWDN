Jose Hugo Pelaez, a native and\n\ncitizen of Colombia, petitions for relief from the denial of his\n\nclaims for asylum under 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a), and for withholding of\n\nremoval.      The   Immigration    Judge       found   that     Pelaez   had   not\n\ndemonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution justifying asylum.\n\nThe Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed the decision without\n\nopinion, in accordance with the Department of Justice's (DOJ)\n\n\"streamlined\" appellate review procedures.             Pelaez challenges both\n\nthe   Immigration   Judge's   denial      of    his    asylum    claim   and   the\n\nconstitutionality     of    the   DOJ's        affirmance     without    opinion\n\nprocedures.    We affirm.\n\n                                  I. ASYLUM\n\n            To be eligible for asylum, Pelaez bears the burden of\n\nproving that he qualifies as a \"refugee.\"                 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)\n\n(2003).    The Immigration and Nationality Act \"defines a refugee as\n\nan alien who cannot or does not want to return to his home country\n\n'because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on\n\naccount of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular\n\nsocial group, or political opinion.'\"              Manzoor v. United States\n\nDep't of Justice, 254 F.3d 342, 346 (1st Cir. 2001) (quoting 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A) (2003)).          A petitioner can prove that he\n\nqualifies as a refugee in one of two ways: \"(1) by demonstrating\n\npast persecution, thus creating a presumption of a well-founded\n\nfear of persecution; or (2) by demonstrating a well-founded fear of\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fpersecution.\"         Yatskin v. INS, 255 F.3d 5, 9 (1st Cir. 2001).                 We\n\nreview a denial of a petition for asylum under a substantial\n\nevidence standard.           Id.   We will reverse a decision of the IJ or\n\nBIA   only     if     \"the   record   evidence      would   compel     a   reasonable\n\nfactfinder to make a contrary determination.\"                     Aguilar-Solis v.\n\nINS, 168 F.3d 565, 569 (1st Cir. 1999).1\n\n               Before assessing the record evidence in this case, we\n\nmust address Pelaez's suggestion in his brief and assertion at oral\n\nargument       that    the    IJ   \"found    that    he     did   in   fact    suffer\n\n'persecution' as a threshold matter.\"                  The government strongly\n\ndisagrees with this contention, asserting that the IJ did not find\n\nthat Pelaez suffered past persecution, and that, \"in fact, Pelaez\n\nmade no allegation of past persecution in his application for\n\nasylum or during his testimony before the Immigration Judge.\"                        The\n\nstakes in this disagreement are considerable.                 If the IJ had found\n\nthat Pelaez demonstrated past persecution on the basis of political\n\nopinion, he would have established a presumption of a well-founded\n\nfear of persecution.           Under INS regulations, this finding would\n\nthen shift the burden of proof to the government, requiring it to\n\nprove     by   a    preponderance     of    the   evidence    that     the    fear    of\n\n\n      1\n       \"Ordinarily, Courts of Appeals review decisions of the\n[BIA], and not those of an IJ. When the BIA does not render its\nown opinion, however, and either defers [to] or adopts the opinion\nof the IJ, a Court of Appeals must then review the decision of the\nIJ.\" Albathani v. INS, 318 F.3d 365, 373 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting\nGao v. Ashcroft, 299 F.3d 266, 271 (3d Cir. 2002)) (alterations in\noriginal; internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n                                           -3-\n\fpersecution is not well-founded, either because \"[t]here has been\n\na fundamental change in circumstances\" in the petitioner's home\n\ncountry, 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1)(i)(A), or because the petitioner\n\n\"could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part\" of\n\nhis home country, 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1)(i)(B).                  Moreover, if the\n\nIJ had found that Pelaez suffered past persecution because of his\n\npolitical opinions, and then failed to allocate the burden of proof\n\nproperly,      that   misallocation    would      have    been    a    legal   error.\n\nManzoor, 254 F.3d at 348 (finding that \"the BIA erred in allocating\n\nthe   burden    of    proof   to   Manzoor   to    show    that       the   threat   of\n\npersecution was country-wide\").\n\n            We find nothing in the IJ's opinion that supports the\n\nclaim that she made a finding of past persecution.                      Moreover, we\n\nagree with the government that Pelaez did not properly raise the\n\nissue of past persecution before the IJ.             Indeed, there is only a\n\nsingle   mention      of   \"past   persecution\"     in    a   closing       statement\n\nPelaez's attorney made to the IJ.            Consequently, we will analyze\n\nPelaez's claim before us only as one citing a well-founded fear of\n\npersecution.         See Yatskin, 255 F.3d at 9 (\"[A] reviewing court\n\nshould judge the action of an administrative agency based only on\n\nreasoning provided by the agency.\").\n\n            Before departing Colombia for the United States, Pelaez\n\nworked as the Chief Secretary of Planning for the city of Cartago.\n\nThe Immigration Judge found this position to be a \"political\n\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fpatronage type of job,\" to which Pelaez was appointed because of\n\nhis involvement with the Conservative Social Party.                As Planning\n\nSecretary,    Pelaez    oversaw   urban      development     projects   and    was\n\nresponsible for the enforcement of property and zoning regulations.\n\nIn June 1996, a colleague in the Planning Office was assassinated\n\nafter he had received death threats.                Shortly thereafter, Pelaez\n\nalso began to receive threats at work and at his home.                   In his\n\nview,   these   threats    came   from      local    property   developers     and\n\nbuilders who were connected with the drug trade.                 In June 1998,\n\nPelaez had a particularly heated meeting with a developer who\n\nimplied that he was carrying a weapon.               Only two months later, in\n\nAugust 1998, Pelaez traveled on business to Brazil, Chile, and\n\nArgentina. He returned to Colombia in September 1998, and remained\n\nthere until May 1999, when he and his wife traveled to the U.S. on\n\ntourist visas.     Pelaez filed his application for asylum in 2000.\n\n             Pelaez    argues   that   he    has     a   well-founded   fear    of\n\npersecution on the basis of political opinion because the threats\n\nhe received resulted from his position as Secretary of Planning in\n\nCartago -- a political job requiring him to further the political\n\naims of the Mayor.      Pelaez contends that his enforcement of zoning\n\nregulations, his role in drafting new property laws, and his\n\nwillingness to root out corruption in the Planning office were\n\npolitical acts, engendering retribution by local property owners\n\nbased on political opinion.            Whether the performance of one's\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fgovernmental      job   can       be   deemed     political    opinion    or   imputed\n\npolitical opinion for the purpose of an asylum determination\n\npursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a) is a difficult question that the IJ\n\nchose not to answer. Instead, she assumed arguendo that Pelaez had\n\ndrawn the necessary nexus between the threats he received as a\n\nresult of his government work and the threat of persecution on the\n\nbasis of political opinion, and concluded that he still had not\n\nproven a \"well-founded fear of persecution.\" We follow her lead on\n\nappeal.\n\n            \"To    prove      a    well-founded      fear     of    persecution,   the\n\n'applicant's      fear     must        be    both     genuine       and   objectively\n\nreasonable.'\"      Morales v. INS, 208 F.3d 323, 330 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n(quoting Aguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d at 572).                   The IJ concluded that\n\nPelaez's conduct before his arrival in the United States \"undercut\"\n\nhis claim that he feared persecution if he were to return to\n\nColombia.    As noted, shortly after receiving a threatening visit\n\nfrom a developer, Pelaez traveled on business to three other\n\ncountries in South America, but chose to return to Colombia after\n\nhis business was concluded.              The IJ found that Pelaez's voluntary\n\nreturn to Colombia and his failure to apply for asylum in any of\n\nthe countries he visited on his business trip undermined his claim\n\nthat he genuinely feared persecution at home.                      We agree.\n\n            The IJ also concluded that Pelaez \"has not shown he could\n\nnot relocate to another part of Colombia.\"                          Such ability to\n\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\frelocate is a relevant consideration in determining whether a fear\n\nof persecution is well founded.     See 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(2)(ii)\n\n(\"An applicant does not have a well-founded fear of persecution if\n\nthe applicant could avoid persecution by relocating to another part\n\nof the applicant's country of nationality . . . if under all the\n\ncircumstances it would be reasonable to expect the applicant to do\n\nso.\").   Pelaez testified that he has family living in other parts\n\nof Colombia.    The IJ also relied on the fact that Pelaez had\n\n\"skills that would be useful to him in an urban center,\" and that\n\n\"Colombia is a large country, and [Pelaez] is not sure that he\n\ncould not relocate elsewhere.\"    These conclusions are supported by\n\nthe evidence in the record.\n\n           As we have stated, a petitioner seeking reversal of a\n\ndenial of asylum must show that \"the evidence presented was so\n\ncompelling that no reasonable fact-finder could fail to find that\n\n[he] was persecuted on the basis of political opinion or had a\n\nwell-founded fear of such persecution.\"    Morales, 208 F.3d at 331.\n\nThe evidence in this case does not meet that standard.2\n\n\n\n\n     2\n       Pelaez also applied for withholding of deportation, but\nbecause the burden of proof under that section is \"more stringent\nthan that for asylum, 'a petitioner unable to satisfy the asylum\nstandard fails, a fortiori, to satisfy the former.'\" Velasquez v.\nAshcroft, 316 F.3d 31, 34 n.2 (quoting Alvarez-Flores v. INS, 909\nF.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1990)). Therefore, we also affirm the IJ's\ndenial of that claim.\n\n                                 -7-\n\f                    II. STREAMLINED APPEALS PROCESS\n\n          Pelaez    also   challenges   the    constitutionality   of   the\n\nrecent amendments to the DOJ's regulations governing appeals to the\n\nBIA.   See 8 C.F.R. § 3.1(a)(7) (2003).         These regulations permit\n\none member of the BIA to summarily affirm, without written opinion,\n\na decision of an Immigration Judge.           This same objection to the\n\nregulations was recently rejected in our circuit in Albathani, 318\n\nF.3d at 375-79.      There is nothing for us to add to that well-\n\nreasoned opinion.\n\n          AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\f",

Moreover, if the\n\nIJ had found that Pelaez suffered past persecution because of his\n\npolitical opinions, and then failed to allocate the burden of proof\n\nproperly,      that   misallocation    would      have    been    a    legal   error.\n\nManzoor, 254 F.3d at 348 (finding that \"the BIA erred in allocating\n\nthe   burden    of    proof   to   Manzoor   to    show    that       the   threat   of\n\npersecution was country-wide\").\n\n            We find nothing in the IJ's opinion that supports the\n\nclaim that she made a finding of past persecution.                      Moreover, we\n\nagree with the government that Pelaez did not properly raise the\n\nissue of past persecution before the IJ.             Indeed, there is only a\n\nsingle   mention      of   \"past   persecution\"     in    a   closing       statement\n\nPelaez's attorney made to the IJ.            Consequently, we will analyze\n\nPelaez's claim before us only as one citing a well-founded fear of\n\npersecution.         See Yatskin, 255 F.3d at 9 (\"[A] reviewing court\n\nshould judge the action of an administrative agency based only on\n\nreasoning provided by the agency.\").\n\n            Before departing Colombia for the United States, Pelaez\n\nworked as the Chief Secretary of Planning for the city of Cartago.\n\nThe Immigration Judge found this position to be a \"political\n\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fpatronage type of job,\" to which Pelaez was appointed because of\n\nhis involvement with the Conservative Social Party.                As Planning\n\nSecretary,    Pelaez    oversaw   urban      development     projects   and    was\n\nresponsible for the enforcement of property and zoning regulations.\n\nIn June 1996, a colleague in the Planning Office was assassinated\n\nafter he had received death threats.                Shortly thereafter, Pelaez\n\nalso began to receive threats at work and at his home.                   In his\n\nview,   these   threats    came   from      local    property   developers     and\n\nbuilders who were connected with the drug trade.                 In June 1998,\n\nPelaez had a particularly heated meeting with a developer who\n\nimplied that he was carrying a weapon.               Only two months later, in\n\nAugust 1998, Pelaez traveled on business to Brazil, Chile, and\n\nArgentina. He returned to Colombia in September 1998, and remained\n\nthere until May 1999, when he and his wife traveled to the U.S. on\n\ntourist visas.     Pelaez filed his application for asylum in 2000.\n\n             Pelaez    argues   that   he    has     a   well-founded   fear    of\n\npersecution on the basis of political opinion because the threats\n\nhe received resulted from his position as Secretary of Planning in\n\nCartago -- a political job requiring him to further the political\n\naims of the Mayor.      Pelaez contends that his enforcement of zoning\n\nregulations, his role in drafting new property laws, and his\n\nwillingness to root out corruption in the Planning office were\n\npolitical acts, engendering retribution by local property owners\n\nbased on political opinion.            Whether the performance of one's\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fgovernmental      job   can       be   deemed     political    opinion    or   imputed\n\npolitical opinion for the purpose of an asylum determination\n\npursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a) is a difficult question that the IJ\n\nchose not to answer. Instead, she assumed arguendo that Pelaez had\n\ndrawn the necessary nexus between the threats he received as a\n\nresult of his government work and the threat of persecution on the\n\nbasis of political opinion, and concluded that he still had not\n\nproven a \"well-founded fear of persecution.\" We follow her lead on\n\nappeal.\n\n            \"To    prove      a    well-founded      fear     of    persecution,   the\n\n'applicant's      fear     must        be    both     genuine       and   objectively\n\nreasonable.'\"      Morales v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768205\"><a href=\"/opinion/768205/juan-antonio-morales-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">208</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">323</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 330 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n(quoting Aguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d at 572).                   The IJ concluded that\n\nPelaez's conduct before his arrival in the United States \"undercut\"\n\nhis claim that he feared persecution if he were to return to\n\nColombia.    As noted, shortly after receiving a threatening visit\n\nfrom a developer, Pelaez traveled on business to three other\n\ncountries in South America, but chose to return to Colombia after\n\nhis business was concluded.              The IJ found that Pelaez's voluntary\n\nreturn to Colombia and his failure to apply for asylum in any of\n\nthe countries he visited on his business trip undermined his claim\n\nthat he genuinely feared persecution at home.                      We agree.\n\n            The IJ also concluded that Pelaez \"has not shown he could\n\nnot relocate to another part of Colombia.\"                          Such ability to\n\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\frelocate is a relevant consideration in determining whether a fear\n\nof persecution is well founded.     See 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(2)(ii)\n\n(\"An applicant does not have a well-founded fear of persecution if\n\nthe applicant could avoid persecution by relocating to another part\n\nof the applicant's country of nationality . . . if under all the\n\ncircumstances it would be reasonable to expect the applicant to do\n\nso.\").   Pelaez testified that he has family living in other parts\n\nof Colombia.    The IJ also relied on the fact that Pelaez had\n\n\"skills that would be useful to him in an urban center,\" and that\n\n\"Colombia is a large country, and [Pelaez] is not sure that he\n\ncould not relocate elsewhere.\"    These conclusions are supported by\n\nthe evidence in the record.\n\n           As we have stated, a petitioner seeking reversal of a\n\ndenial of asylum must show that \"the evidence presented was so\n\ncompelling that no reasonable fact-finder could fail to find that\n\n[he] was persecuted on the basis of political opinion or had a\n\nwell-founded fear of such persecution.\"    Morales, 208 F.3d at 331.\n\nThe evidence in this case does not meet that standard.2\n\n\n\n\n     2\n       Pelaez also applied for withholding of deportation, but\nbecause the burden of proof under that section is \"more stringent\nthan that for asylum, 'a petitioner unable to satisfy the asylum\nstandard fails, a fortiori, to satisfy the former.'\" Velasquez v.\nAshcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">316</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 34 n.2 (quoting Alvarez-Flores v.

Therefore, we also affirm the IJ's\ndenial of that claim.\n\n                                 -7-\n\f                    II. STREAMLINED APPEALS PROCESS\n\n          Pelaez    also   challenges   the    constitutionality   of   the\n\nrecent amendments to the DOJ's regulations governing appeals to the\n\nBIA.   See 8 C.F.R. § 3.1(a)(7) (2003).         These regulations permit\n\none member of the BIA to summarily affirm, without written opinion,\n\na decision of an Immigration Judge.           This same objection to the\n\nregulations was recently rejected in our circuit in Albathani, 318\n\nF.3d at 375-79.      There is nothing for us to add to that well-\n\nreasoned opinion.\n\n          AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\f</pre>",
