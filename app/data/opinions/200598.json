At the conclusion of a three week\n\ntrial, a federal jury found former Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\n(\"FBI\") agent John J. Connolly, Jr., guilty of one count of\n\nracketeering      under        the   Racketeer      Influenced        and      Corrupt\n\nOrganizations Act (\"RICO\"), 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), two counts of\n\nobstruction of justice, 18 U.S.C. § 1503, and one count of making\n\nfalse    statements,      18    U.S.C.     §    1001.        The    district    court\n\nsubsequently imposed a sentence of 121 months of imprisonment,\n\nfollowed by a two-year period of supervised release.                   Connolly now\n\nappeals his RICO conviction, arguing that he is entitled to a\n\njudgment of acquittal on the RICO charge because the government\n\nfailed   to    prove   two     critical    elements     of    its   RICO    charge    —\n\nparticipation in an \"enterprise,\" and a \"pattern of racketeering\n\nactivity.\"      See id. § 1961(4), (5) (defining \"enterprise\" and\n\n\"pattern of racketeering activity\").1\n\n              Connolly also appeals his sentence, arguing that the\n\ndistrict court erred in its calculation of the applicable offense\n\nlevel pursuant to sections 2E1.1, 2J1.2, and 2X3.1 of the United\n\nStates    Sentencing      Guidelines        (\"U.S.S.G.\"       or     \"Guidelines\").\n\nFinally, Connolly argues that the district court erred when it\n\ndenied his request to convene a post-verdict evidentiary hearing to\n\ninquire into the propriety of alleged note-taking by jurors.                         He\n\n\n\n     1\n       Connolly does not appeal his convictions for obstruction of\njustice and making a false statement.\n\n                                          -2-\n\fasks that we remand the case to the district court for an inquiry\n\ninto possible juror misconduct.\n\n            Finding no reason to disturb Connolly's conviction or\n\nsentence or to remand to the district court, we affirm.\n\n                                    I.\n\n            We provide some general background facts here, saving our\n\nmore detailed discussion of the evidence for our assessment in Part\n\nII of Connolly's claims of evidentiary insufficiency.               Connolly\n\njoined the FBI in 1968; from 1973 until 1990 he served as an agent\n\nin   the   Bureau's   Boston   office.     During   his   tenure,    he   was\n\nresponsible    for    handling   several    high-ranking,    confidential\n\ninformants with connections to two criminal syndicates — the Winter\n\nHill Gang, and the New England branch of La Cosa Nostra.        According\n\nto the government, the Winter Hill Gang is a \"clandestine criminal\n\norganization engaged in multiple crimes, including murder, bribery,\n\nextortion, loan sharking, and illegal gambling in the greater\n\nBoston, Massachusetts area.\"        La Casa Nostra — a considerably\n\nlarger, better known, and more established criminal organization —\n\nsimilarly engages in illegal activities in and around Boston.\n\nDespite the fact that the Winter Hill Gang and La Cosa Nostra were\n\noften rivals, members of the two groups frequently cooperated in\n\ncriminal undertakings.\n\n            Two of the informants for whom Connolly was responsible,\n\nJames Bulger and Stephen Flemmi, were members of the Winter Hill\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fGang.     Bulger and Flemmi reported on the activities of both the\n\nGang and La Cosa Nostra for over a decade.       Shortly after Connolly\n\nretired from the FBI in 1990, however, Bulger and Flemmi were\n\n\"closed\" as FBI informants — i.e., the FBI no longer desired their\n\nservices.\n\n            After Bulger and Flemmi ceased to serve as informants,\n\ntheir involvement with the Gang's criminal activities nonetheless\n\ncontinued.    For example, at some point in the early 1990s, Flemmi,\n\nworking with the \"boss\" of La Cosa Nostra's Boston family, Frank\n\nSalemme, ran an illegal \"numbers\" operation in the Boston area. On\n\nJanuary 10, 1995, a federal grand jury indicted Bulger, Flemmi,\n\nSalemme, and several other persons for multiple counts of         illegal\n\ngambling, extortion, assault, bribery, obstruction of justice,\n\nloansharking, and RICO violations.       See United States v. Salemme,\n\nNo.   94-CR-10287-MLW-2   (D.   Mass.   Jan.   10,   1995)   (indictment).\n\nFlemmi was quickly arrested and taken into custody.            Bulger and\n\nSalemme, however, forewarned of the pending indictment, disappeared\n\na few days before its issuance.          The authorities apprehended\n\nSalemme eight months later.     Bulger remains at large.\n\n             The instant criminal proceeding began in December 1999,\n\nwhen another federal grand jury indicted Flemmi and Connolly on\n\ncharges of racketeering, obstruction of justice, and conspiracy.2\n\n\n      2\n       The indictment also named Bulger as a defendant on one\ncount. That count was ultimately dismissed on the government's\nmotion after the issuance of the superceding indictment (which did\n\n                                  -4-\n\fA superceding indictment was filed in October 2000 with additional\n\ncharges of obstruction of justice and making a false statement.\n\nAccording to the superceding indictment, Connolly had led a double-\n\nlife for over two decades. While serving as an FBI agent, Connolly\n\nhad been intimately involved in the criminal activities of the\n\nWinter Hill Gang and its members, receiving and making bribes from\n\nand on behalf of members of the Gang.    Even after his retirement\n\nfrom the Bureau, Connolly allegedly continued to exploit his\n\nconnections within the Bureau to become privy to confidential\n\ninformation that he would then pass along to members of the Winter\n\nHill Gang.\n\n          Specifically, the superceding indictment included nine\n\ncounts, which we summarize as follows:\n\n          Counts 1 & 2 – RICO and Conspiracy to Violate\n          RICO, alleging that Connolly had, through a\n          pattern of racketeering activity, participated\n          in the affairs of an association-in-fact\n          enterprise whose members included Bulger,\n          Flemmi, himself, and unidentified others. The\n          purpose of the enterprise was to protect\n          Bulger,    Flemmi,   and    their   associates\n          (including Salemme and members of the Winter\n          Hill Gang) from arrest and prosecution, and to\n          facilitate their criminal activities. The two\n          counts detail fourteen different \"racketeering\n          acts,\" including allegations of bribery,\n          extortion, and obstruction of justice.\n\n          Count 3 – Conspiracy to Obstruct Justice,\n          alleging that Connolly and Flemmi, together\n          with others, had conspired to obstruct justice\n\n\n\nnot name Bulger as a defendant).\n\n                               -5-\n\f          in the prosecution of Bulger, Flemmi,      and\n          Salemme in United States v. Salemme.\n\n          Count 4 – Obstruction of Justice, alleging\n          that Connolly had informed Salemme of the\n          pending indictment in United States v.\n          Salemme.\n\n          Count 5 – Obstruction of Justice, alleging\n          that Flemmi had also provided Salemme with\n          news of the pending indictment.\n\n          Count 6 – Obstruction of Justice, alleging\n          that Connolly had caused an anonymous letter\n          to be sent to Judge Mark Wolf who was\n          presiding over United States v. Salemme. The\n          letter purported to come from three unnamed\n          Boston Police Officers and credited certain\n          claims made by the defense.\n\n          Counts 7 & 8 — Obstruction of Justice,\n          alleging that Connolly had persuaded Flemmi to\n          give false testimony in United States v.\n          Salemme.    Specifically, Connolly persuaded\n          Flemmi to testify that another FBI agent — and\n          not Connolly — had alerted him and Bulger to\n          the pending indictment.\n\n          Count 9 – False Statement, alleging that\n          Connolly had lied to an FBI agent when he told\n          the agent that he had not been in contact with\n          the defense team in United States v. Salemme.\n\nFlemmi ultimately pleaded guilty to Counts 3 and 5 (the only two\n\ncounts in which he was named) and was sentenced to 41 months of\n\nimprisonment.\n\n          In May 2002, the trial against Connolly began on Counts\n\n1, 4, 6, 7, and 9.3   At the close of the government's case and at\n\nthe close of all of the evidence, Connolly moved for a judgment of\n\n\n     3\n       The remaining counts against Connolly were severed prior to\ntrial and ultimately dismissed on the government's motion.\n\n                                -6-\n\facquittal pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 29.                  The court denied the\n\nmotions.       The jury returned guilty verdicts against Connolly on\n\nfour of the five counts at issue — Counts 1, 6, 7 and 9 — and\n\nacquitted on Count 4.            Connolly renewed his Rule 29 motion after\n\nthe verdict, and the court once again denied it.\n\n               On September 16, 2002, the district court sentenced\n\nConnolly to a term of incarceration of 121 months followed by a\n\ntwo-year period of supervised release.                 The district court denied\n\nConnolly's request for release on bail pending appeal, and we\n\ndenied     a    similar,    subsequent         application.       We    now   address\n\nConnolly's arguments of error by the trial court.\n\n                                             II.\n\n               Connolly claims that he is entitled to a judgment of\n\nacquittal on the RICO count because the government failed to\n\npresent sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt two\n\nessential       elements        of     the   RICO    charge:      (1)     Connolly's\n\nparticipation       in     an        \"enterprise,\"    and   (2)   a     \"pattern   of\n\nracketeering activity,\" as defined by statute and applicable case\n\nlaw.     See 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4), (5).\n\n               In evaluating a claim of insufficiency of the evidence,\n\nwe review the record de novo, and \"[w]e will affirm the conviction\n\nif, 'after assaying all the evidence in the light most amiable to\n\nthe government, and taking all reasonable inferences in its favor,\n\na rational factfinder could find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that\n\n\n                                             -7-\n\fthe prosecution successfully proved the essential elements of the\n\ncrime.'\"     United States v. Boulerice, 325 F.3d 75, 79 (1st Cir.\n\n2003) (quoting United States v. O'Brien, 14 F.3d 703, 706 (1st Cir.\n\n1994)).     We \"need not believe that no verdict other than a guilty\n\nverdict could sensibly be reached.\"              United States v. Gomez, 255\n\nF.3d 31, 35 (1st Cir. 2001) (quoting United States v. Echeverri,\n\n982 F.2d 675, 677 (1st Cir. 1993)).          Rather, the operative inquiry\n\nis \"whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable\n\nto the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the\n\nessential    elements   of     the   crime   beyond   a    reasonable   doubt.\"\n\nJackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979) (original emphasis).\n\n            To   that   end,    a    reviewing    court   must   play   \"a   very\n\ncircumscribed role in gauging the sufficiency of the evidentiary\n\nfoundation upon which a criminal conviction rests.\"              United States\n\nv. Blasini-Lluberas, 169 F.3d 57, 62 (1st Cir. 1999).             We will give\n\nconsiderable deference to a jury's assessment of the evidence, and\n\nwe will disturb the jury's verdict only if it is premised upon\n\n\"evidentiary interpretations and illations that are unreasonable,\n\ninsupportable, or overly speculative.\" United States v. Czubinski,\n\n106 F.3d 1069, 1073 (1st Cir. 1997).               That is to say, we will\n\nreverse only if the verdict is irrational.                See United States v.\n\nBerrios, 132 F.3d 834, 843 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"[W]e must consider the\n\nevidence in the light most favorable to the verdict and reverse\n\nonly if no rational trier of fact could have found him guilty.\").\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\f          The   RICO    count   alleged   a   violation   of   18   U.S.C.\n\n§ 1962(c), which provides in pertinent part:\n\n          It shall be unlawful for any person employed\n          by or associated with any enterprise . . . to\n          conduct    or    participate,    directly    or\n          indirectly,    in    the   conduct    of   such\n          enterprise's affairs through a pattern of\n          racketeering    activity   or   collection   of\n          unlawful debt.\n\nThe meaning of \"enterprise\" and \"pattern of racketeering activity\"\n\nis explicated in § 1961:\n\n          (4) \"enterprise\" includes any individual,\n          partnership, corporation, association, or\n          other legal entity, and any union or group of\n          individuals associated in fact although not a\n          legal entity;\n\n          (5)   \"pattern   of   racketeering   activity\"\n          requires at least two acts of racketeering\n          activity, one of which occurred after the\n          effective date of this chapter and the last of\n          which occurred within ten years (excluding any\n          period of imprisonment) after the commission\n          of a prior act of racketeering activity;\n\nThe Supreme Court has repeatedly indicated that courts should take\n\na \"natural and commonsense approach\" in assessing the elements of\n\na RICO violation.

Inc.,    492   U.S.   at   241).     Against      this\n\nbackdrop, we now turn to Connolly's specific claims.\n\n                              A.     \"Enterprise\"\n\n1.   The Charge\n\n            Count   1   of   the   superceding      indictment    alleged      that\n\nConnolly,    Bulger,     Flemmi,      and     others    were    members   of    an\n\n\"enterprise,\" that is to say, \"a group of individuals associated in\n\nfact,\" 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4), and that this enterprise,\n\n            through its members and associates, acted to\n            protect James Bulger, Stephen Flemmi and their\n            associates, including Francis P. Salemme and\n            those in the Winter Hill Gang, from arrest and\n            prosecution for criminal activities including\n            murder, loan sharking, illegal gambling,\n            extortion,   obstruction   of   justice,   and\n            bribery; and it acted to facilitate those\n            criminal activities of Bulger, Flemmi, and\n            their associates.\n\nThe indictment further alleged that the enterprise protected and\n\nfostered its members' criminal activities by\n\n            (1)   providing   Bulger   and   Flemmi   with\n            confidential   law   enforcement   information\n            regarding Grand Jury investigations, court-\n            authorized electronic surveillance, and other\n            investigative efforts; (2) deflecting and\n            squelching    prosecutions     and    criminal\n            investigations of their crimes; and (3)\n            improperly preserving their status as FBI\n            informants through the filing of misleading\n            official reports and by failing to report\n            information relating to Bulger and Flemmi\n            which was material to the investigation of\n            criminal activity.\n\nThe indictment distinguishes this association-in-fact enterprise\n\nfrom the Winter Hill Gang and La Cosa Nostra, though individual\n\n                                       -10-\n\faffiliations do overlap.       The indictment also alleges that members\n\nof the enterprise committed fourteen different \"racketeering acts,\"\n\nwhich included several acts of bribery, obstruction of justice, and\n\nextortion.\n\n2.   The Evidence\n\n           Kevin Weeks, who identified himself as Bulger's \"right-\n\nhand   man,\"    was   the   government's       star    witness    and    provided\n\nsubstantial testimony regarding the existence of the enterprise.\n\nFor example, Weeks testified that a special fund was created from\n\nsome of the proceeds of Bulger's and Flemmi's criminal activities,\n\nand that Connolly received cash payments from that fund in exchange\n\nfor a regular flow of information about law enforcement activities\n\nthat might affect the group.          Additionally, Weeks testified that\n\nConnolly was the enterprise's contact in the FBI, and that Bulger\n\nhad given Connolly money in return for protecting the enterprise.\n\nAccording to Weeks, Bulger told him that Connolly was \"one of\n\nours.\"    John    Martorano,      a   member   of     the    Winter   Hill   Gang,\n\ncorroborated     Weeks's    testimony     regarding         Connolly's   repeated\n\nreceipt   of   gratuities    in   exchange     for    information.        Salemme\n\nlikewise testified that he and Flemmi had twice set aside $5000\n\nfrom the proceeds of their numbers racket to pay Connolly for the\n\ninformation he provided.\n\n             In return for these payments, Connolly provided a wealth\n\nof sensitive information, often with dire consequences.                        For\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fexample, Martorano testified that Connolly told Bulger that an\n\ninformant    named      Richard   Castucci    had    provided    the   FBI   with\n\ninformation regarding the whereabouts of two fugitive Winter Hill\n\nmembers.    Bulger told Martorano of the leak, and Martorano in turn\n\nmurdered    Castucci     in   order   to   silence       him.   Martorano    also\n\ntestified that Connolly had told Bulger and others that another\n\ninformant, Brian Halloran, had implicated Martorano in the murder\n\nof a recalcitrant associate, Roger Wheeler.                Weeks testified that\n\nBulger,    upon   learning     from   Connolly      of    Halloran's   betrayal,\n\nambushed Halloran as he got into a car outside a Boston restaurant,\n\nand fatally shot both Halloran and the driver, Michael Donahue.\n\n            Martorano also testified that Connolly told Bulger and\n\nFlemmi that the FBI agents who had been working with Halloran were\n\ngoing to put pressure on another associate, John Callahan, to come\n\nclean about the Wheeler murder.            According to Martorano, Connolly\n\ntold Bulger and Flemmi that they were \"all going to go to jail for\n\nthe rest of our life if something doesn't happen to John Callahan.\"\n\nWorried about the possibility of a breach, Bulger and Flemmi\n\nconvinced Martorano that Callahan had to be silenced. In an effort\n\nto   deflect      any    attention    away     from       the   ongoing   Boston\n\ninvestigation, Martorano lured Callahan to Florida where, with\n\nanother associate, he murdered Callahan.\n\n            Weeks also testified that he and Bulger had extorted a\n\nperson named Stephen Rakes into selling them a South Boston liquor\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fstore.    After Weeks had forcibly acquired ownership of the store,\n\nRakes's   wife    went    to   her   uncle,   Joseph   Lundbohm,   who   was   a\n\ndetective in the Boston Police Department. Lundbohm testified that\n\nhe, in turn, went to Connolly with the problem, and Connolly stated\n\nthat nothing could be done unless Rakes agreed to wear a recording\n\ndevice.   Lundbohm, out of fear for the safety of his niece and her\n\nhusband, told Connolly that wearing a wire would be unacceptable.\n\nConnolly did not take any action to stop the extortionate takeover,\n\nnor did he report the incident to his superiors.\n\n              As for Connolly's efforts to derail the United States v.\n\nSalemme prosecution, Weeks testified that on December 23, 1994,\n\nConnolly came to the South Boston liquor store that Weeks and\n\nBulger had extorted from the Rakes, looking for Bulger. Only Weeks\n\nwas on the premises, however, and Connolly led him to the inside of\n\nthe walk-in refrigerator at the back of the store where electronic\n\nsurveillance would be difficult.          There, Connolly told Weeks that\n\nhe had just learned that federal indictments were pending against\n\nBulger and Flemmi and that agents planned to make arrests over the\n\nholidays.      Even though Connolly no longer worked at the FBI, he\n\ntold Weeks that he was certain of this information because it had\n\ncome   from    then-FBI    Assistant    Special   Agent   in   Charge    Dennis\n\nO'Callaghan.     Connolly also indicated that only four people in the\n\nFBI knew about the pending indictment.            Connolly instructed Weeks\n\nto pass along the information to Bulger and Flemmi immediately.\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\fWeeks did so.       Flemmi, in turn, passed along the information to\n\nSalemme. Bulger and Salemme both skipped town and managed to avoid\n\narrest.     Salemme was ultimately arrested eight months later.\n\nBulger's whereabouts remain unknown.\n\n            Weeks also testified that he and Connolly had worked\n\ntogether to compose a letter that they submitted anonymously to\n\nJudge Mark Wolf, the United States District Judge presiding over\n\nthe United States v. Salemme case.          The letter, printed on Boston\n\nPolice Department letterhead, claimed to be from three disgruntled\n\nBoston Police Officers, and stated that the wiretaps the government\n\nwas planning to use in its prosecution had been illegally obtained.\n\nJudge Wolf testified that the letter had caused him to order the\n\nparties to submit briefs, to hold a number of pretrial hearings,\n\nand to hear testimony on the contents of the letter.                       Weeks\n\ntestified that Connolly eventually told him the identities of the\n\nconfidential informants who had worn the wiretaps, and Weeks passed\n\nalong this information to Flemmi and Salemme in jail.\n\n            Finally, Weeks testified that Connolly feared that Flemmi\n\nwould divulge Connolly's involvement in the enterprise and name him\n\nas   the   person   who   had   leaked   the   news   of   the    indictments.\n\nConnolly,    through      Weeks,   convinced    Flemmi     to    testify    that\n\nConnolly's former FBI supervisor, John Morris, had tipped him off\n\nabout the indictments. However, Morris had been transferred out of\n\nBoston in 1991, long before the indictment issued.                According to\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fWeeks, Connolly advised Weeks that Flemmi should testify that\n\nMorris had learned of the impending indictments through what is\n\nknown as a \"pros memo\" (i.e., prosecution memo) that Morris had\n\nseen while in Washington.           Flemmi ultimately testified to that\n\neffect during hearings before Judge Wolf.\n\n3.   The Legal Requirements for an Enterprise\n\n             As    the   Supreme    Court    indicated     in    Turkette,    the\n\ngovernment    is    required   to    prove    both   the    existence    of   an\n\n\"enterprise\" and a \"pattern of racketeering activity.\"\n\n          The enterprise is an entity, for present\n          purposes a group of persons associated\n          together for a common purpose of engaging in a\n          course    of   conduct.     The   pattern   of\n          racketeering activity is, on the other hand, a\n          series of criminal acts as defined by the\n          statute. The former is proved by evidence of\n          an ongoing organization, formal or informal,\n          and by evidence that the various associates\n          function as a continuing unit. The latter is\n          proved by evidence of the requisite number of\n          acts   of    racketeering committed   by   the\n          participants in the enterprise.     While the\n          proof used to establish these separate\n          elements may in particular cases coalesce,\n          proof of one does not necessarily establish\n          the other.      The \"enterprise\" is not the\n          \"pattern of racketeering activity\"; it is an\n          entity separate and apart from the pattern of\n          activity in which it engages. The existence\n          of an enterprise at all times remains a\n          separate element which must be proved by the\n          Government.\n\nTurkette, 452 U.S. at 583 (citation omitted).                   As this passage\n\nmakes clear, an enterprise is not merely a related assortment of\n\ncriminal activities.       Rather, there must be some goal — \"a purpose\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\fof engaging in a course of conduct\" — beyond the isolated benefit\n\nthat can redound from the commission of each criminal act, and\n\nthere     must    be       an    \"ongoing        organization\"       with    \"associates\n\nfunction[ing] as a continuous unit.\"                     Id.   The organization need\n\nnot be formal or have an \"ascertainable structure.\"                         United States\n\nv. Patrick, 248 F.3d 11, 19 (1st Cir. 2001).                        To the contrary, it\n\nneed only be a \"group of persons associated together for a common\n\npurpose of engaging in a criminal course of conduct.\"                               United\n\nStates v. Owens, 167 F.3d 739, 751 n.6 (1st Cir. 1999) (quoting\n\nUnited    States      v.     Doherty,      867    F.2d   47,   68    (1st    Cir.   1989))\n\n(modification omitted).\n\n4.   Connolly's Arguments\n\n            a.     Continuity\n\n            Connolly argues that the evidence failed to demonstrate\n\n\"that the members of the alleged enterprise had functioned as an\n\nongoing organization\" (original emphasis). In pressing this claim,\n\nhe   focuses     on    the      fourteen    racketeering       acts    alleged      in   the\n\nindictment.4      These fourteen acts were submitted to the jury for a\n\n\n      4\n       Racketeering Acts 1 through 10 allegedly took place during\nConnolly's tenure as an FBI agent. Act 1 alleged that Connolly\ntook a bribe from Bulger and Flemmi. Acts 2 through 5 alleged that\nConnolly paid bribes to Morris on behalf of Bulger and Flemmi. Act\n6 pertained to Connolly's involvement in the extortion of Rakes.\nActs 7 through 9 concerned Connolly's sharing of confidential law\nenforcement information that led to the killings of Castucci,\nCallahan, and Halloran. Act 10 alleged that Connolly, working with\nMorris, had informed Bulger and Flemmi of a court-authorized\nwiretap and an ongoing grand jury investigation into illegal\ngambling activity. Racketeering Acts 11 through 14 allegedly took\n\n                                            -16-\n\fdetermination of \"proven beyond a reasonable doubt\" or \"not proven\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\"           Of the fourteen, the jury found nine\n\nof   them    \"not   proven   beyond      a    reasonable          doubt.\"         Of   the\n\nracketeering    acts   found     by   the     jury   to   be      \"proven        beyond   a\n\nreasonable doubt,\" one was an act of bribery in 1982 or 1983, and\n\nthe other were four acts of obstruction of justice in the mid- to\n\nlate-1990s    in    connection    with       the    United     States       v.    Salemme\n\nprosecution.\n\n            Connolly    cites     these      findings        to    argue     that      the\n\ngovernment had failed to prove \"continuity\" in the enterprise,\n\ni.e., that the enterprise had functioned as an ongoing organization\n\nover the period of time alleged, from September 1975 to September\n\n1998.   Since the jury found that all but one of the alleged\n\nracketeering acts dating from the 1970s and 1980s had not been\n\nproven beyond a reasonable doubt, Connolly argues that there was an\n\ninsufficient basis for the jury to conclude that Connolly was part\n\nof an ongoing criminal enterprise.                 See, e.g., United States v.\n\n\n\nplace during the period 1994 to 1998, after Connolly had retired\nfrom the FBI. All four involved obstruction of justice surrounding\nthe United States v. Salemme case and are discussed in more detail\nin Part II.B below.\n     Several of the Acts were broken down into subparts, each one\nhaving the same factual basis. For example, the indictment divided\nthe sixth Racketeering Act into Act 6A and 6B, \"either one of which\nalone constitutes Racketeering Act 6.\" As described on the verdict\nsheet, Act 6A accused Connolly of \"aiding and abetting the\nextortion of Julie and Stephen Rakes,\" while 6B accused him of\n\"aiding and abetting a conspiracy to extort Julie and Stephen\nRakes.\"\n\n                                       -17-\n\fPelullo, 964 F.2d 193, 212 (3d Cir. 1992) (noting that RICO\n\nenterprises should be \"distinguished from individuals who associate\n\nfor the commission of sporadic harm\").\n\n            We reject this argument for two reasons.                   First, the\n\ngovernment introduced significant evidence of the existence of the\n\nenterprise    apart    from    the    specified    racketeering      acts.     For\n\nexample, Weeks, Martorano, and Salemme testified about several\n\npayments made to Connolly over the period in question that do not\n\nappear in the alleged racketeering acts.               They also testified that\n\nthese payments were made to guarantee the flow of confidential law\n\nenforcement information from Connolly to members of the enterprise.\n\nThis   testimony       provided      evidence     of    an   ongoing     criminal\n\nrelationship between Connolly and members of the enterprise, and\n\nsupported     the   jury's     ultimate       finding    regarding     Connolly's\n\nparticipation in an ongoing association-in-fact.\n\n             Second,    as    the    government   correctly    argues,       simply\n\nbecause the jury found a specified racketeering act as \"unproven\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt\" does not mean that the jury found the\n\nevidence relating to that act unpersuasive, in combination with\n\nother evidence in the case, on the existence of an association-in-\n\nfact enterprise.       Rather, it may only mean that the government did\n\nnot prove a requisite element of the underlying crime alleged as a\n\nracketeering act.       For example, the district court instructed the\n\njury that in order to prove Act 1 — that Connolly had accepted a\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\fbribe —     the   government     had   to   demonstrate    that    Connolly   had\n\n\"demanded, sought, or received a thing of value as a quid pro quo,\n\nor in return for a promise, implicit or stated, to do or omit to do\n\na particular act in violation of his lawful duty.\"                In returning a\n\nfinding of \"unproven,\" the jury could have concluded that the\n\nevidence underlying Act 1, while failing to demonstrate this\n\nrequisite    quid   pro   quo,    nevertheless      demonstrated       a   corrupt\n\ngratuity evidencing the existence of an illegal enterprise.\n\n            Likewise, Racketeering Act 7, as described on the verdict\n\nsheet, alleged that Connolly had committed obstruction of justice\n\nby \"alerting Bulger that Richard Castucci was an informant.\"                  The\n\ndistrict    court   instructed     the      jury   that   in   order   to    prove\n\nobstruction of justice, the government had to demonstrate that\n\nConnolly had knowingly endeavored to obstruct or impede a pending\n\njudicial proceeding. The court also instructed the jury that \"[a]\n\njudicial proceeding is pending once a grand jury, for example,\n\nbegins its investigation or when an indictment has been returned.\"\n\nThe jury might have concluded, however, that Connolly leaked\n\ninformation regarding Castucci for the purpose of frustrating an\n\nFBI investigation, and not to obstruct the grand jury proceedings.\n\n            Hence, the fact that nine of the fourteen enumerated\n\nracketeering acts were found \"unproven\" does not compel a finding\n\nof no continuity in the enterprise. The evidence relating to those\n\nacts remained available to the jury in its evaluation of the\n\n\n                                       -19-\n\fenterprise element of the RICO charge.                   Cf. United States v.\n\nVastola, 899 F.2d 211, 222 (3d Cir.) (holding that findings of not\n\nguilty on three of four alleged predicate racketeering acts do not\n\nmandate judgment of acquittal on RICO count), vacated on other\n\ngrounds, 497 U.S. 1001 (1990).                 That being so, the inquiry on\n\nappeal is whether the jury, in light of the totality of the\n\nevidence, was presented with sufficient evidence of \"continuity\" to\n\nsupport a conviction.          See United States v. Powell, 469 U.S. 57, 67\n\n(1984).      Given the testimony of Weeks, Martorano, and others\n\nrecounting a regular course of criminal conduct over two decades,\n\nwe have no difficulty in concluding that the government satisfied\n\nits burden on this point.\n\n             b.    Organization\n\n             Connolly next argues that the government failed to adduce\n\nsufficient evidence demonstrating \"that the members of the alleged\n\nenterprise        had    functioned      as   a   continuing       unit\"   (original\n\nemphasis).         Rather, as Connolly characterizes it, the evidence\n\ndemonstrated,       at    most,   \"the    sporadic    occurrence      of   [criminal\n\nracketeering] activity\" by a group that had \"no name, no regular\n\nbusiness   or      activities,     no    cohesion     over   time,    no   sense   of\n\nmembership or ongoing association, no sharing of resources or\n\nrevenues, [and] no systemic linkage or coordination of activities.\"\n\nHence,    according       to   Connolly,      there   were   \"no    indicia   of   an\n\norganization\" and, therefore, no \"enterprise.\"\n\n\n                                          -20-\n\f            We disagree with Connolly's appraisal of the evidence, as\n\nwell as his reading of the term \"enterprise.\"                    The evidence showed\n\nthat Connolly, Bulger, Flemmi, Salemme, and others worked together\n\nin an association-in-fact enterprise over a period of almost two\n\ndecades, joining forces to protect themselves from prosecution and\n\nto    further    other   criminal       activities     —   some     alleged     in    the\n\nindictment,      and    others    not   specifically       alleged.        There      was\n\ncohesion in the group over time; the membership shared resources\n\nand revenues; there was, in fact, a sense of membership.\n\n            As    for    the     meaning   of   \"enterprise,\"           there    is    no\n\nrequirement under RICO that an enterprise have an \"ascertainable\n\nstructure.\"      Patrick, 248 F.3d at 19.        Indeed, as the Supreme Court\n\nnoted in Turkette, \"[t]here is no restriction upon the associations\n\nembraced by the [statute's] definition,\" Turkette, 452 U.S. at 580,\n\nand \"Congress has instructed us to construe RICO 'liberally . . .\n\nto effectuate its remedial purposes.'\" United States v. London, 66\n\nF.3d 1227, 1243 (1st Cir. 1995) (quoting Pub. L. No. 91-452, §\n\n904(a), 84 Stat. 922, 947 (1970) (reprinted in note following 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1961)).         Hence an \"enterprise\" need only be \"a group of\n\npersons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a\n\ncriminal course of conduct.\"            Owens, 167 F.3d at 751 n.6; see also\n\nBoylan, 898 F.2d at 242 (\"What counts is whether it can be said, on\n\nthe    totality     of    the     evidence,     that       all     of   the     alleged\n\n\n\n\n                                         -21-\n\fcoconspirators directed their efforts towards the accomplishment of\n\na common goal. . . .\") (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n            Construing the term \"enterprise\" broadly, as we must, we\n\nhave no difficulty in concluding that the association-in-fact\n\nalleged in the indictment was sufficiently \"organized\" to support\n\na RICO conviction, and that the government had adequately proved\n\nthe existence of that enterprise to sustain a conviction.                  Indeed,\n\nthere was a discernable structure to the enterprise, with members\n\nplaying designated roles in keeping the enterprise functioning as\n\na viable unit. For example, Martorano could be considered the head\n\nof the enterprise's enforcement division, executing individuals who\n\ncould prove to be a liability.                 Connolly's role was that of\n\ninformation     officer,     i.e.,   an   intelligence        conduit   from   law\n\nenforcement.     Weeks, as Bulger's \"right-hand man,\" managed special\n\nfunds and functioned as an intermediary between Bulger and others.\n\n            Connolly      insists,   however,     that   Bulger,     Flemmi,   and\n\nothers were actually members of the Winter Hill Gang, and that this\n\nsomehow    forecloses      the   possibility     of    membership    in    another\n\nenterprise.     We fail to follow this logic.          As the indictment makes\n\nclear,    the   alleged    enterprise     in    this   case    —   while   perhaps\n\noverlapping in membership and some criminal activities with the\n\nWinter Hill Gang and even La Cosa Nostra — was a separate entity,\n\ndistinguishable from both of these other criminal organizations.\n\nMembership in the Winter Hill Gang does not, ipso facto, preclude\n\n\n                                      -22-\n\fmembership in another criminal enterprise.                While the evidence\n\ndemonstrated that Bulger, Flemmi, and others were associates of the\n\nWinter Hill Gang, it also demonstrated that they were members of a\n\nseparate enterprise dedicated to their own protection and the\n\nadvancement of their own criminal activities.             Moreover, evidence\n\nwas presented suggesting that the enterprise was distinct (if not\n\ntotally separate) from the Winter Hill Gang. For example, the jury\n\nheard testimony that part of the money that the enterprise's\n\nmembers extorted or otherwise illegally procured was used to pay\n\nbribes necessary to ensure the enterprise's survival.               Moreover,\n\nBulger told Weeks that Connolly, who was not a member of the Winter\n\nHill   Gang,    was   nevertheless   \"one   of   ours.\"      The   jury   could\n\ntherefore have readily inferred the existence of a continuing unit\n\nwhich included Connolly and was distinct from the Winter Hill Gang.\n\n                 B.   \"Pattern of Racketeering Activity\"\n\n1.   The Predicate Acts\n\n            Racketeering Acts 11 and 12 occurred in late 1994 or\n\nearly 1995 and concerned Connolly's tip-offs to Bulger, Flemmi, and\n\nSalemme regarding their indictment.         Racketeering Act 13 occurred\n\nin March 1997 and concerned the fraudulent, anonymous letter that\n\nConnolly sent to Judge Wolf purporting to be from three police\n\nofficers.      Racketeering Act 14 occurred in 1998 and concerns the\n\n\n\n\n                                     -23-\n\ffalse testimony that Flemmi gave after being coached and directed\n\nby Connolly.5\n\n2.   The Legal Requirements for a Pattern\n\n           While the RICO statute does not define in absolute terms\n\nwhat constitutes a \"pattern of racketeering activity,\" it does set\n\na minimum requirement: proof of a pattern of racketeering activity\n\n\"requires [proof of] at least two acts of racketeering activity\"\n\nwithin a ten-year period.    18 U.S.C. § 1961(5).   The Supreme Court,\n\ninterpreting RICO, has stated that \"while two acts are necessary,\n\nthey may not be sufficient.\"      Sedima, S.P.R.L. v.

Inc., 492\n\nU.S. at 238 (emphasis added).      The two factors most pertinent to\n\nthis determination, according to the Court, are relatedness and\n\ncontinuity.     See id. at 239 (\"It is this factor of continuity plus\n\n\n\n\n     5\n       In evaluating Connolly's argument regarding the \"pattern of\nracketeering activity\" element, we do not rely on the \"unproven\"\nRacketeering Acts (1 through 3 and 5 through 10) described in note\n4, supra.    The Third Circuit, however, has indicated that a\nreviewing court need not be constrained by the jury's findings\nregarding the individual racketeering acts in determining whether\nthe evidence, taken as a whole, supports an ultimate finding of\nguilt through a \"pattern of racketeering activity.\" See Vastola,\n899 F.2d at 222–23.     Since the \"proven\" racketeering acts (11\nthrough 15) establish the requisite pattern, we need not consider\nwhether other evidence adduced at trial supports such a finding.\n\n                                 -24-\n\frelationship which combines to produce a pattern.\") (original\n\nemphasis) (citation omitted).\n\n          Continuity, according to the Supreme Court, can refer\n\n\"either to a closed period of repeated conduct, or to past conduct\n\nthat by its nature projects into the future with a threat of\n\nrepetition.\"   Id. at 241.   We have previously indicated that it is\n\n\"'difficult to formulate in the abstract any general test' for the\n\ncontinuity required for a pattern.\" Apparel Art Int'l v. Jacobson,\n\n967 F.2d 720, 722 (1st Cir. 1992) (quoting H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at\n\n241); see also Efron v. Embassy Suites (P.R.), Inc., 223 F.3d 12,\n\n15 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"We have more than once remarked upon the\n\ndifficulty of articulating concrete guidelines for this 'continuity\n\nplus relationship' standard for identifying a pattern.\").    In H.J.\n\nInc. the Supreme Court noted that Congress chose not to define\n\n\"pattern of racketeering activity\" with any degree of specificity\n\nin the RICO statute.   Hence, the Court instructed lower courts to\n\nadopt a flexible approach to RICO claims, employing a \"commonsense,\n\neveryday understanding of RICO's language and Congress' gloss on\n\nit.\"   H.J. Inc. 492 U.S. at 241.       Lower courts, in turn, have\n\nrepeatedly looked to one guidepost contained in H.J. Inc.:        \"A\n\nparty alleging a RICO violation may demonstrate continuity over a\n\nclosed period by proving a series of related predicates extending\n\nover a substantial period of time,\"     or by evidence that the acts\n\n\"include a specific threat of repetition extending indefinitely\n\n\n\n                                 -25-\n\finto the future.\"        Id. at 242.         Because RICO was intended by\n\nCongress to apply only to enduring criminal conduct, \"[p]redicate\n\nacts extending over a few weeks or months and threatening no future\n\ncriminal conduct do not satisfy this requirement.\" Id.; Efron, 223\n\nF.3d at 15; Apparel Art, 967 F.2d at 723.\n\n3.   Connolly's Argument\n\n            Connolly concedes that the four racketeering acts at\n\nissue are sufficiently related for RICO purposes.             Each act served\n\nto protect members of the enterprise.            Connolly insists, however,\n\nthat the four racketeering acts simply constituted a \"single\n\ncriminal episode,\" that they did not present the threat of ongoing\n\nconduct, and that they therefore were not a pattern of racketeering\n\nactivity.    We disagree.\n\n            While we have previously indicated that \"[w]e can be\n\nreasonably    certain\"      that   the    pattern   requirement       \"does   not\n\nencompass a single criminal episode, a single 'crime' (in the\n\nordinary, nontechnical sense of that word),\" Apparel Art, 967 F.2d\n\nat 722 (original emphasis), we have also indicated that a \"single\n\ncriminal episode\" is something narrow in scope and purpose, for\n\nexample, a single interstate bank robbery.                 As we explained in\n\nApparel   Art,   a   bank   robbery      could   include    several    different\n\n\"crimes\" (in the technical sense of the word) — such as gun\n\npossession, threatening a teller, stealing a getaway car, and\n\neventually lying about one's participation — but they nevertheless\n\n\n                                      -26-\n\fdo not add up to a \"pattern of racketeering activity.\"                        See id.\n\nThe instant case, however, is altogether different.                     Here, there\n\nwere at least three different \"episodes\" — the disclosing of the\n\nindictment, the fabricated letter, and the perjured testimony —\n\neach planned and executed independently of the others over a period\n\nof years, and each the result of detailed planning and scheming by\n\nmembers of a criminal enterprise seeking to impede the criminal\n\nprosecutions of their cohorts.                 This is precisely the kind of\n\nactivity that RICO was intended to forestall.                     See H.J. Inc., 492\n\nU.S. at 247–48.\n\n          As    for    the     threat    of    future    criminal      conduct,    the\n\nracketeering    acts     at    issue    were    part    of   an    ongoing    criminal\n\nenterprise undertaken to facilitate future criminal acts by other\n\nmembers of that enterprise.            The enterprise sought to insure that\n\nits members would never be brought to justice, and indeed, one of\n\nthem is still at large.             As the government describes it, the\n\nenterprise     engaged    in    a   \"do-whatever-is-necessary\"               long-term\n\npattern of criminal activity that threatened ongoing criminal\n\nconduct of the sort that RICO was designed to prevent.6                      In short,\n\n     6\n       The Second Circuit has noted that courts have been quicker\nto find RICO violations \"in cases where the acts of the defendant\nor the enterprise were inherently unlawful, such as murder or\nobstruction of justice, and were in pursuit of inherently unlawful\ngoals.\" United States v. Aulicino, 44 F.3d 1102, 1111 (2d Cir.\n1995).   We agree with the common-sense conclusion that in such\nsituations, there is a greater threat of future criminal conduct.\nOf course, as explained in the text, there is no hard and fast\nrule, and the fact that there may be \"inherently unlawful\" conduct\nunderlying the RICO charge would not prevent us from concluding\n\n                                        -27-\n\fthere was ample evidence supporting the jury's conclusion that the\n\ngovernment had satisfied the \"pattern of racketeering activity\"\n\nelement of the crime.\n\n                                       III.\n\n          In sentencing Connolly, the district court relied upon\n\nthe Pre-Sentence Report (\"PSR\") prepared by the U.S. Probation\n\nOffice.       The   PSR   calculated      the    appropriate   sentence      after\n\nnavigating through a series of cross-references as follows (with\n\nthe cross-referenced subject matter underlined for the reader's\n\nconvenience):\n\n          C    Under U.S.S.G. § 2E1.1, the base offense level for a\n\n               RICO conviction is the greater of either (i) 19, or\n\n               (ii)   the       offense   applicable     to    the   underlying\n\n               racketeering activity, i.e., obstruction of justice.\n\n          C    As for the underlying racketeering activity, under\n\n               U.S.S.G.     §    2J1.2,    the    base   offense     level    for\n\n               obstruction of justice is 12. Subsection (c), however,\n\n               indicates that if the obstruction of justice interfered\n\n               with the investigation or prosecution of a criminal\n\n               offense, the court should look to § 2X3.1 (accessory\n\n               after the fact) with respect to the criminal offense\n\n\n\n\nthat there was nevertheless no pattern of racketeering activity.\nSee, e.g., Miranda v. Ponce Fed. Bank, 948 F.2d 41, 45–46 (1st Cir.\n1991).\n\n                                       -28-\n\f                obstructed, provided that the corresponding offense\n\n                level is greater than 12.\n\n            C   Section 2X3.1 provides that the base offense level for\n\n                being an accessory after the fact is 6 levels lower\n\n                than the offense level for the underlying offense, but\n\n                in no event less than 4, or more than 30.\n\n            C   The   PSR   identified        first-degree   murder   as    the\n\n                underlying offense because (1) Connolly's racketeering\n\n                activities concerned the obstruction of the prosecution\n\n                of United States v. Salemme, and (2) the most serious\n\n                of the underlying offenses charged in the Salemme\n\n                indictment was first-degree murder.\n\n            C   Under § 2A1.1, the base offense level for first-degree\n\n                murder is 43.\n\nUnder   §   2X3.1,    however,   the    maximum    base   offense   level   for\n\naccessory after the fact is 30.           The Probation Office therefore\n\nrecommended a base offense level of 30.           The PSR determined that no\n\nadjustment was necessary for the multiple counts, or for any other\n\nreason, and that Connolly should be placed in Criminal History\n\nCategory I.      The corresponding sentencing range for Category I,\n\nwhen combined with an offense level of 30, is 97 to 121 months.\n\n            At sentencing, Connolly challenged the calculation of the\n\noffense level, arguing that he was not \"subjectively aware\" of the\n\nmore serious charges alleged in the Salemme indictment, and that\n\n\n\n                                       -29-\n\ffirst-degree      murder   should    therefore      not    be    considered    the\n\n\"underlying offense\" under U.S.S.G. § 2X3.1.                The district court\n\nproperly overruled Connolly's objection.              See United States v.\n\nMcQueen, 86 F. 3d 180, 184 (11th Cir. 1996) (\"Neither § 2J1.2(c)(1)\n\nnor   §   2X3.1   requires    such   knowledge      as     a    prerequisite   to\n\napplication of the offense level for the 'underlying offense.'\").\n\nIt then adopted the factual findings and the Guidelines calculation\n\ncontained in the PSR, and sentenced Connolly to the maximum of the\n\napplicable range, i.e., 121 months.\n\n            On appeal, Connolly abandons his subjective knowledge\n\nargument and presses a new argument that the district court made a\n\n\"basic    mistake\"   in    sentencing   when   it    referenced      the   murder\n\nguideline \"without conducting any fact-finding\" as to what exactly\n\nconstitutes the \"underlying offense.\"            Since Connolly raises this\n\nobjection for the first time on appeal, we review for plain error\n\nonly.     United States v. Henderson, 320 F.3d 92, 102 (1st Cir.\n\n2003); see United States v. Grant, 971 F.2d 799, 803 (1st Cir.\n\n1992) (noting that \"as a general rule, appellant may not 'switch\n\nhorses mid-stream' and raise new legal arguments not made the basis\n\nfor objections in the district court\").               Accordingly, Connolly\n\n\"bears the burden of proving (1) an error, (2) that is plain, and\n\n(3) that affects substantial rights.\"               United States v. Downs-\n\nMoses, 329 F.3d 253, 263 (1st Cir. 2003).                 Assuming he can meet\n\nthis high hurdle, Connolly must then demonstrate that the error\n\n\n\n                                     -30-\n\f\"seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation\n\nof judicial proceedings.\"          United States v. Matos, 328 F.3d 34, 43\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).\n\n            The plain language of the applicable sections of the\n\nGuidelines does not support Connolly's argument.                The obstruction\n\nof justice guideline, § 2J1.2(c), provides that:\n\n            If the offense involved obstructing the\n            investigation or prosecution of a criminal\n            offense, apply § 2X3.1 (Accessory After the\n            Fact) in respect to that criminal offense, if\n            the resulting offense level is greater than\n            that determined above.\n\n(emphasis added).         We fail to see how this language obliges an\n\nevidentiary inquiry into the substance of \"that criminal offense.\"\n\nMoreover,       the   commentary     to   section     1B1.5     (governing    the\n\ninterpretation of cross-references) indicates that,\n\n            A reference may direct that, if the conduct\n            involved   another   offense,   the   offense\n            guideline for such other offense is to be\n            applied. . . . Where there is more than one\n            such offense, the most serious such offense .\n            . . is to be used.\n\nU.S.S.G.    §    1B1.5,   comment.     (n.1).       The   PSR   followed     these\n\ndirectives to the letter.             The jury found that Connolly had\n\nobstructed the prosecution in United States v. Salemme at various\n\ntimes from late 1994 to mid-1998, including after the grand jury\n\nhad returned a superceding indictment charging Flemmi, Bulger,\n\nSalemme, and others with a number of crimes, including first-degree\n\nmurder. The Probation Office reasonably looked to the most serious\n\n\n\n                                      -31-\n\foffense contained in the superseding indictment, and, as explained\n\nabove, calculated the base offense level at 30.\n\n            This is not to say that a factual inquiry into the\n\nunderlying offense would never be appropriate.              For example, if a\n\ndefendant were convicted of obstruction of justice for lying in a\n\ngrand jury proceeding, a sentencing court would be justified in\n\nprobing    deeper    into    the   nature     of    the   underlying    offense.\n\nOtherwise, the perjurer, through his false testimony, could cause\n\nan indictment for a minor (instead of a serious) crime to issue,\n\nand then gain the benefit of his perjury if the court were to rely\n\nsolely on the indictment in determining the underlying offense.\n\nThe converse, of course, is also true — an overzealous prosecutor\n\ncould    seek   to   enhance    the    perjurer's    sentence   by     spuriously\n\nconvincing a grand jury to increase the counts in an indictment.\n\nHence, the Fourth Circuit has held that, in such a situation, a\n\nfactual inquiry into what constitutes the underlying offense would\n\nnot be inappropriate.          See United States v. Dickerson, 114 F.3d\n\n464, 467–68 (4th Cir. 1997).          The Ninth Circuit, citing Dickerson,\n\nindicated in United States v. Arias, 253 F.3d 453 (9th Cir. 2001),\n\nthat a    factual    inquiry    into    the   underlying    offense     would   be\n\nappropriate only if there were a \"genuine dispute\" as to its\n\nsubstance.      Id. at 461 (emphasis added).\n\n            Connolly relies unpersuasively on Dickerson and Arias in\n\npressing his claim.         Unlike Dickerson, Connolly did not perjure\n\n\n\n                                       -32-\n\fhimself before a grand jury, and there was therefore no risk of\n\nover- or under-charging of the indictment. And unlike Arias, there\n\nis no genuine dispute in this case as to the underlying offense.\n\nWhen Connolly wrote the fraudulent letter to Judge Wolf, and when\n\nhe instructed Flemmi on how to lie on the witness stand, the\n\nSalemme   prosecution   included   charges   of   first-degree   murder.\n\nMoreover, Weeks testified during the trial that Connolly's goal was\n\nto get the entire case against Flemmi \"tossed out,\" and substantial\n\nevidence adduced at trial supports that conclusion.      Finally, even\n\nassuming that an inquiry into the underlying offense would be\n\nappropriate in this case, and assuming it was error for the\n\ndistrict court not to undertake that inquiry sua sponte, any such\n\nerror would be far from \"plain,\" i.e., \"clear, in the sense that it\n\nwas obvious.\"   United States v. Geronimo, 330 F.3d 67, 74–75 (1st\n\nCir. 2003) (internal quotation marks omitted).        Indeed, the fact\n\nthat Connolly, who was ably represented by counsel below, only\n\nbelatedly turns to this argument, and cites only two cases from\n\nother jurisdictions, belies any claim that the error was truly\n\n\"obvious.\"\n\n             Since Connolly has failed to demonstrate that the\n\ndistrict court committed any error — plain or otherwise — when it\n\ndetermined that first-degree murder was the \"underlying offense\"\n\nfor purposes of U.S.S.G. § 2J1.2(c) and § 2X3.1, we affirm the\n\nsentence imposed by the district court.\n\n\n\n                                   -33-\n\f                                    IV.\n\n          On the first day of trial, when the jury first entered\n\ninto the courtroom, the district court judge noticed that one of\n\nthe jurors    was   carrying   a   notebook.     Without   prompting   from\n\ncounsel, the judge informed the jury as follows:\n\n          I noticed one of you came in with a notebook.\n          I just want to alert you that I do not permit\n          note taking.    I want you to just sit and\n          listen to the evidence and then use your\n          collective memories as you deliberate at the\n          conclusion of the case. Some very, very fine\n          judges, colleagues, friends of mine, they do\n          permit note taking. I don't. I want you to\n          just sit back and pay attention. So that is\n          the way we will proceed.\n\nConnolly did not object to this instruction, nor did he seek\n\nclarification or modification of it.           The parties do not recall\n\nseeing any jurors taking notes in the courtroom over the course of\n\nthe trial.\n\n          Almost a month after the trial had ended, an article\n\nappeared in the Boston Globe which stated, in pertinent part:\n\n          Although the judge had prohibited jurors from\n          taking notes during the trial, some jurors\n          went home and jotted down testimony they had\n          heard that day, according to [two jurors]. \"A\n          couple of jurors took notes at night, which\n          was very helpful [during deliberations],\" [one\n          juror] said.\n\n(second modification in original).         Arguing that the jury may have\n\nrelied   on     \"extraneous        prejudicial     information\"    during\n\ndeliberations, Connolly filed a motion for an evidentiary inquiry\n\ninto whether jurors had, in fact, taken notes during trial and\n\n                                    -34-\n\fwhether    they     had   considered   any   such     notes   during   their\n\ndeliberations.      In a brief order, the district court denied the\n\nrequest:\n\n             On the first day of trial I told the jurors I\n             did not permit note taking during trial . . .\n             . I did not, however, forbid the jurors from\n             making notes of their impressions of the\n             evidence when not in court. Indeed, writing\n             material was provided to the jurors in their\n             deliberating room.     It was expected that\n             jurors would make notes and use them during\n             their deliberations. There is no occasion for\n             the    inquiry   requested    by   Defendant.\n             Defendant's Motion, therefore, is DENIED.\n\nConnolly now assigns error to this decision,7 asking that we remand\n\nthe   case    for    further   inquiry    into      this   purported   juror\n\n\"misconduct.\"\n\n             We review the district court's response to an allegation\n\nof juror misconduct only for abuse of discretion.               See United\n\nStates v. Ortiz-Arrigoitia, 996 F.2d 436, 442 (1st Cir. 1993)\n\n(indicating that district court has broad discretion to \"determine\n\nthe nature and extent of its inquiry\" into juror improprieties);\n\nMahoney v.

Bassler, 651 F.2d 600, 601–02 (8th Cir. 1981), we\nindicated that \"[e]ven assuming that the jurors consulted these\nnotes during deliberations, it is far from clear that prejudice\nshould be presumed in the absence of a cautionary instruction\n[regarding the proper use of notes during deliberations].\"\n\n                                   -35-\n\fthat district court judges have \"broad discretion in determining\n\nhow to respond to allegations of extraneous influence on jurors\");\n\nBoylan, 898 F.2d at 258 (\"[T]he district court has broad discretion\n\nto determine the type of investigation which must be mounted.\").\n\n            Federal Rule of Evidence 606(b) codifies the \"near-\n\nuniversal and firmly established common-law rule\" that prohibits\n\nthe admission of juror testimony to impeach a jury verdict.

There are significant\n\npolicy considerations underlying such a rule, including finality,\n\nmaintaining the integrity of the jury system, encouraging frank and\n\nhonest deliberations, and the protection of jurors from subsequent\n\nharassment by a losing party.       See McDonald v. Pless, 238 U.S. 264,\n\n267–68 (1915).      Rule 606(b) does, however, create an exception to\n\nthe common-law rule in situations where \"extraneous prejudicial\n\ninformation [is] improperly brought to the jury's attention.\" Fed.\n\nR. Evid. 606(b).         Despite this exception, we have nevertheless\n\nwarned that \"[c]ourts generally 'should be hesitant[ ] to haul\n\njurors in after they have reached a verdict . . . to probe for\n\npotential       instances    of   bias,     misconduct,     or     extraneous\n\ninfluences.'\"      Neron v. Tierney, 841 F.2d 1197, 1205 (1st Cir.\n\n1988) (quoting United States v. Moon, 718 F.2d 1210, 1234 (2d Cir.\n\n1983)).     A    court   should   only    conduct   such   an    inquiry   when\n\n\"reasonable grounds for investigation exist,\" i.e., \"there is\n\nclear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a\n\n\n\n                                    -36-\n\fspecific, nonspeculative impropriety has occurred which could have\n\nprejudiced the trial of a defendant.\"                Moon, 718 F.2d at 1234\n\n(citation omitted).          Connolly cannot meet this high standard.\n\n              The Boston Globe article indicated that two jurors made\n\nnotes    at    home   some    evenings     regarding   that   day's   in-court\n\ntestimony. We agree with the district court that this note-taking,\n\nassuming it actually happened, was not inconsistent with the\n\ncourt's instructions.          The judge told the jurors that he wanted\n\nthem to focus on the testimony, not in-court note-taking:              \"I want\n\nyou to just sit back and pay attention.\"             Such a prescript did not\n\nforeclose the possibility of note-taking outside of court. Indeed,\n\nas the district judge noted, the jurors were provided with writing\n\nmaterials in the jury room from the outset of trial.               Hence, the\n\nnote-taking described in the Globe article did not constitute juror\n\nmisconduct.\n\n              Moreover, assuming that any notes actually made their way\n\ninto the jury room during deliberations,8 the notes cannot be\n\nconsidered an \"extraneous\" or \"extrinsic\" influence.              In Bassler,\n\nthe district court instructed the jury at the beginning of the\n\ntrial that note-taking was not permitted.              Like the two jurors in\n\nConnolly's     trial,   one     of   the   Bassler   jurors   understood   this\n\ninstruction to mean that \"no notes should be taken during the\n\nactual trial time but could be taken during recess or other times\n\n     8\n       We have previously noted the Globe article's ambiguity on\nthis point. See supra note 7.\n\n                                       -37-\n\foutside actual trial time.\"             Id. at 602.        The juror therefore took\n\nnotes at the end of each day, and these notes eventually found\n\ntheir way into the jury room during deliberations.                           The Bassler\n\ncourt held that the juror's daily notes could not be considered an\n\nimproper     \"extrinsic       influence\"       because       they     were,     in    fact,\n\nintrinsic.     We agree, and \"[i]ntrinsic influences on a jury's\n\nverdict are not competent to impeach a verdict.\"                              Id.     Hence\n\nConnolly cannot rely on the notes to demonstrate prejudice.                             Cf.\n\nUnited   States      v.   Balsam,       203    F.3d    72,      86   (1st     Cir.    2000)\n\n(indicating that sharing of notes in open court by jurors does \"not\n\nraise the same specter of prejudice as improper outside influences\n\nupon the jury\") (emphasis added).\n\n             Even    if   the     notes       could,       somehow,     be     considered\n\n\"extrinsic,\"       Connolly     falls    far     short     of   providing       specifics\n\nregarding    any    prejudice.          Instead,      he    only     insists    that    the\n\ndistrict court should have conducted \"an inquiry.\"                       Tellingly, he\n\ndoes not suggest what form this inquiry should take.                           Rather, he\n\nsimply asks that we remand with instructions to the district court\n\nto \"do what has to be done to ferret out the truth.\"                          He does not\n\nidentify any witnesses he would call at an evidentiary hearing, or\n\nwhat the substance of any testimony could possibly be.                               Indeed,\n\nConnolly has made no proffer of any evidence other than the Boston\n\nGlobe article.        Instead, there is only speculation, and mere\n\n\n\n\n                                          -38-\n\fspeculation can hardly be considered \"clear, strong, substantial\n\nand incontrovertible evidence.\"    Moon, 718 F.2d at 1234.\n\n          We have repeatedly said that courts should respond to\n\nallegations of juror impropriety in a manner appropriate to the\n\nfacts and circumstances at hand. See Ortiz-Arrigoitia, 996 F.2d at\n\n443 (\"The trial judge is not . . . shackled to a rigid and\n\nunyielding set [of] rules and procedures that compel any particular\n\nform or scope of inquiry.\"); Boylan, 898 F.2d at 258 (\"We abjure\n\nimposition of a rigid set of rules for the conduct of inquiries\n\ninto the presence or extent of extrinsic influences.\"); see also\n\nMoon, 718 F.2d at 1234 (\"[E]ach situation in this area is sui\n\ngeneris.\").   Since we agree with the district court's conclusion\n\nthat its instructions to the jury did not preclude note-taking\n\noutside the courtroom, and since Connolly has failed to make any\n\nsubstantial evidentiary showing regarding prejudicial impropriety,\n\nthe district court properly exercised its discretion in denying\n\nConnolly's motion for further inquiry.\n\n                                  V.\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of conviction\n\nentered on the jury's verdict and the sentence of the district\n\ncourt are AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n          SO ORDERED.\n\n\n\n\n                               -39-\n\f",

Connolly, Jr., guilty of one count of racketeering under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\"), 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1962(c), two counts of obstruction of justice, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1503, and one count of making false statements, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1001. The district court subsequently imposed a sentence of 121 months of imprisonment, followed by a two-year period of supervised release. Connolly now appeals his RICO conviction, arguing that he is entitled to a judgment of acquittal on the RICO charge because the government failed to prove two critical elements of its RICO charge &#8212; participation in an \"enterprise,\" and a \"pattern of racketeering activity.\" <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1961(4), (5) (defining \"enterprise\" and \"pattern of racketeering activity\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Connolly also appeals his sentence, arguing that the district court erred in its calculation of the applicable offense level pursuant to sections 2E1.1, 2J1.2, and 2X3.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\"U.S.S.G.\" or \"Guidelines\"). Finally, Connolly argues that the district court erred when it denied his request to convene a post-verdict evidentiary hearing to inquire into the propriety of alleged note-taking by jurors. He asks that we remand the case to the district court for an inquiry into possible juror misconduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finding no reason to disturb Connolly's conviction or sentence or to remand to the district court, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We provide some general background facts here, saving our more detailed discussion of the evidence for our assessment in Part II of Connolly's claims of evidentiary insufficiency. Connolly joined the FBI in 1968; from 1973 until 1990 he served as an agent in the Bureau's Boston office. During his tenure, he was responsible for handling several high-ranking, confidential informants with connections to two criminal syndicates &#8212; the Winter Hill Gang, and the New England branch of La Cosa Nostra. According to the government, the Winter Hill Gang is a \"clandestine criminal organization engaged in multiple crimes, including murder, bribery, extortion, loan sharking, and illegal gambling in the greater Boston, Massachusetts area.\" La Casa Nostra &#8212; a considerably larger, better known, and more established criminal organization &#8212; similarly engages in illegal activities in and around Boston. Despite the fact that the Winter Hill Gang and La Cosa Nostra were often rivals, members of the two groups frequently cooperated in criminal undertakings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two of the informants for whom Connolly was responsible, James Bulger and Stephen Flemmi, were members of the Winter Hill Gang. Bulger and Flemmi reported on the activities of both the Gang and La Cosa Nostra for over a decade. Shortly after Connolly retired from the FBI in 1990, however, Bulger and Flemmi were \"closed\" as FBI informants &#8212; i.e., the FBI no longer desired their services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Bulger and Flemmi ceased to serve as informants, their involvement with the Gang's criminal activities nonetheless continued. For example, at some point in the early 1990s, Flemmi, working with the \"boss\" of La Cosa Nostra's Boston family, Frank Salemme, ran an illegal \"numbers\" operation in the Boston area. On January 10, 1995, a federal grand jury indicted Bulger, Flemmi, Salemme, and several other persons for multiple counts of illegal gambling, extortion, assault, bribery, obstruction of justice, loansharking, and RICO violations. <i>See United States v. Salemme,</i> No. 94-CR-10287-MLW-2 (D.Mass. Jan. 10, 1995) (indictment). Flemmi was quickly arrested and taken into custody. Bulger and Salemme, however, forewarned of the pending indictment, disappeared a few days before its issuance. The authorities apprehended Salemme eight months later. Bulger remains at large.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The instant criminal proceeding began in December 1999, when another federal grand jury indicted Flemmi and Connolly on charges of racketeering, obstruction of justice, and conspiracy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> A superceding indictment was filed in October 2000 with additional charges of obstruction of justice and making a false statement. According to the superceding indictment, Connolly had led a double-life for over two decades. While serving as an FBI agent, Connolly had been intimately involved in the criminal activities of the Winter Hill Gang and its members, receiving and making bribes from and on behalf of members of the Gang. Even after his retirement from the Bureau, Connolly allegedly continued to exploit his connections within the Bureau to become privy to confidential information that he would then pass along to members of the Winter Hill Gang.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Specifically, the superceding indictment included nine counts, which we summarize as follows: <i>Counts 1 &amp; 2</i> &#8212; RICO and Conspiracy to Violate RICO, alleging that Connolly had, through a pattern of racketeering activity, participated in the affairs of an association-in-fact enterprise whose members included Bulger, Flemmi, himself, and unidentified others. The purpose of the enterprise was to protect Bulger, Flemmi, and their associates (including Salemme and members of the Winter Hill Gang) from arrest and prosecution, and to facilitate their criminal activities. The two counts detail fourteen different \"racketeering acts,\" including allegations of bribery, extortion, and obstruction of justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Count 3</i> &#8212; Conspiracy to Obstruct Justice, alleging that Connolly and Flemmi, together with others, had conspired to obstruct justice in the prosecution of Bulger, Flemmi, and Salemme in <i>United States v.

The court denied the motions. The jury returned guilty verdicts against Connolly on four of the five counts at issue &#8212; Counts 1, 6, 7 and 9 &#8212; and acquitted on Count 4. Connolly renewed his Rule 29 motion after the verdict, and the court once again denied it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 16, 2002, the district court sentenced Connolly to a term of incarceration of 121 months followed by a two-year period of supervised release. The district court denied Connolly's request for release on bail pending appeal, and we denied a similar, subsequent application.

Salemme and those in the Winter Hill Gang, from arrest and prosecution for criminal activities including murder, loan sharking, illegal gambling, extortion, obstruction of justice, and bribery; and it acted to facilitate those criminal activities of Bulger, Flemmi, and their associates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The indictment further alleged that the enterprise protected and fostered its members' criminal activities by</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) providing Bulger and Flemmi with confidential law enforcement information regarding Grand Jury investigations, court-authorized electronic surveillance, and other investigative efforts; (2) deflecting and squelching prosecutions and criminal investigations of their crimes; and (3) improperly preserving their status as FBI informants through the filing of misleading official reports and by failing to report information relating to Bulger and Flemmi which was material to the investigation of criminal activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The indictment distinguishes this association-in-fact enterprise from the Winter Hill Gang and La Cosa Nostra, though individual affiliations do overlap. The indictment also alleges that members of the enterprise committed fourteen different \"racketeering acts,\" which included several acts of bribery, obstruction of justice, and extortion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. The Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kevin Weeks, who identified himself as Bulger's \"right-hand man,\" was the government's star witness and provided substantial testimony regarding the existence of the enterprise. For example, Weeks testified that a special fund was created from some of the proceeds of Bulger's and Flemmi's criminal activities, and that Connolly received cash payments from that fund in exchange for a regular flow of information about law enforcement activities that might affect the group. Additionally, Weeks testified that Connolly was the enterprise's contact in the FBI, and that Bulger had given Connolly money in return for protecting the enterprise. According to Weeks, Bulger told him that Connolly was \"one of ours.\" John Martorano, a member of the Winter Hill Gang, corroborated Weeks's testimony regarding Connolly's repeated receipt of gratuities in exchange for information. Salemme likewise testified that he and Flemmi had twice set aside $5000 from the proceeds of their numbers racket to pay Connolly for the information he provided.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In return for these payments, Connolly provided a wealth of sensitive information, often with dire consequences. For example, Martorano testified that Connolly told Bulger that an informant named Richard Castucci had provided the FBI with information regarding the whereabouts of two fugitive Winter Hill members. Bulger told Martorano of the leak, and Martorano in turn murdered Castucci in order to silence him. Martorano also testified that Connolly had told Bulger and others that another informant, Brian Halloran, had implicated Martorano in the murder of a recalcitrant associate, Roger Wheeler. Weeks testified that Bulger, upon learning from Connolly of Halloran's betrayal, ambushed Halloran as he got into a car outside a Boston restaurant, and fatally shot both Halloran and the driver, Michael Donahue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Martorano also testified that Connolly told Bulger and Flemmi that the FBI agents who had been working with Halloran were going to put pressure on another associate, John Callahan, to come clean about the Wheeler murder. According to Martorano, Connolly told Bulger and Flemmi that they were \"all going to go to jail for the rest of our life if something doesn't happen to John Callahan.\" Worried about the possibility of a breach, Bulger and Flemmi convinced Martorano that Callahan had to be silenced. In an effort to deflect any attention away from the ongoing Boston investigation, Martorano lured Callahan to Florida where, with another associate, he murdered Callahan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Weeks also testified that he and Bulger had extorted a person named Stephen Rakes into selling them a South Boston liquor store. After Weeks had forcibly acquired ownership of the store, Rakes's wife went to her uncle, Joseph Lundbohm, who was a detective in the Boston Police Department. Lundbohm testified that he, in turn, went to Connolly with the problem, and Connolly stated that nothing could be done unless Rakes agreed to wear a recording device. Lundbohm, out of fear for the safety of his niece and her husband, told Connolly that wearing a wire would be unacceptable. Connolly did not take any action to stop the extortionate takeover, nor did he report the incident to his superiors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for Connolly's efforts to derail the <i>United States v. Salemme</i> prosecution, Weeks testified that on December 23, 1994, Connolly came to the South Boston liquor store that Weeks and Bulger had extorted from the Rakes, looking for Bulger. Only Weeks was on the premises, however, and Connolly led him to the inside of the walk-in refrigerator at the back of the store where electronic surveillance would be difficult. There, Connolly told Weeks that he had just learned that federal indictments were pending against Bulger and Flemmi and that agents planned to make arrests over the holidays. Even though Connolly no longer worked at the FBI, he told Weeks that he was certain of this information because it had come from then-FBI Assistant Special Agent in Charge Dennis O'Callaghan. Connolly also indicated that only four people in the FBI knew about the pending indictment. Connolly instructed Weeks to pass along the information to Bulger and Flemmi immediately. Weeks did so. Flemmi, in turn, passed along the information to Salemme. Bulger and Salemme both skipped town and managed to avoid arrest. Salemme was ultimately arrested eight months later. Bulger's whereabouts remain unknown.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Weeks also testified that he and Connolly had worked together to compose a letter that they submitted anonymously to Judge Mark Wolf, the United States District Judge presiding over the <i>United States v. Salemme</i> case. The letter, printed on Boston Police Department letterhead, claimed to be from three disgruntled Boston Police Officers, and stated that the wiretaps the government was planning to use in its prosecution had been illegally obtained. Judge Wolf testified that the letter had caused him to order the parties to submit briefs, to hold a number of pretrial hearings, and to hear testimony on the contents of the letter. Weeks testified that Connolly eventually told him the identities of the confidential informants who had worn the concealed recorder, and Weeks passed along this information to Flemmi and Salemme in jail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Weeks testified that Connolly feared that Flemmi would divulge Connolly's involvement in the enterprise and name him as the person who had leaked the news of the indictments. Connolly, through Weeks, convinced Flemmi to testify that Connolly's former FBI supervisor, John Morris, had tipped him off about the indictments. However, Morris had been transferred out of Boston in 1991, long before the indictment issued. According to Weeks, Connolly advised Weeks that Flemmi should testify that Morris had learned of the impending indictments through what is known as a \"pros memo\" (i.e., prosecution memo) that Morris had seen while in Washington. Flemmi ultimately testified to that effect during hearings before Judge Wolf.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. The Legal Requirements for an Enterprise</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Supreme Court indicated in <i>Turkette,</i> the government is required to prove both the existence of an \"enterprise\" and a \"pattern of racketeering activity.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The enterprise is an entity, for present purposes a group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct. The pattern of racketeering activity is, on the other hand, a series of criminal acts as defined by the statute. The former is proved by evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and by evidence that the various associates function as a continuing unit. The latter is proved by evidence of the requisite number of acts of racketeering committed by the participants in the enterprise. While the proof used to establish these separate elements may in particular cases coalesce, proof of one does not necessarily establish the other. The \"enterprise\" is not the \"pattern of racketeering activity\"; it is an entity separate and apart from the pattern of activity in which it engages. The existence of an enterprise at all times remains a separate element which must be proved by the Government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Turkette,</i> 452 U.S. at 583, 101 S.Ct. 2524 (citation omitted). As this passage makes clear, an enterprise is not merely a related assortment of criminal activities. Rather, there must be some goal &#8212; \"a purpose of engaging in a course of conduct\" &#8212; beyond the isolated benefit that can redound from the commission of each criminal act, and there must be an \"ongoing organization\" with \"associates function[ing] as a continuous unit.\" <i>Id.</i> The organization need not be formal or have an \"ascertainable structure.\" <i>United States v. Patrick,</i> 248 F.3d 11, 19 (1st Cir.2001). To the contrary, it need only be a \"group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a criminal course of conduct.\" <i>United States v. Owens,</i> 167 F.3d 739, 751 n. 6 (1st Cir.1999) (quoting <i>United States v. Doherty,</i> 867 F.2d 47, 68 (1st Cir.1989)) (modification omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. Connolly's Arguments</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. Continuity</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Connolly argues that the evidence failed to demonstrate \"that the members of the alleged enterprise had functioned as an <i>ongoing</i> organization\" (original emphasis). In pressing this claim, he focuses on the fourteen racketeering acts alleged in the indictment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> These fourteen acts were submitted to the jury for a determination of \"proven beyond a reasonable doubt\" or \"not proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Of the fourteen, the jury found nine of them \"not proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Of the racketeering acts found by the jury to be \"proven beyond a reasonable doubt,\" one was an act of bribery in 1982 or 1983, and the other were four acts of obstruction of justice in the mid- to late-1990s in connection with the <i>United States v. Salemme</i> prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Connolly cites these findings to argue that the government had failed to prove \"continuity\" in the enterprise, i.e., that the enterprise had functioned as an ongoing organization over the period of time alleged, from September 1975 to September 1998. Since the jury found that all but one of the alleged racketeering acts dating from the 1970s and 1980s had not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, Connolly argues that there was an insufficient basis for the jury to conclude that Connolly was part of an <i>ongoing</i> criminal enterprise. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Pelullo,</i> 964 F.2d 193, 212 (3d Cir.1992) (noting that RICO enterprises should be \"distinguished from individuals who associate for the commission of sporadic harm\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject this argument for two reasons. First, the government introduced significant evidence of the existence of the enterprise apart from the specified racketeering acts. For example, Weeks, Martorano, and Salemme testified about several payments made to Connolly over the period in question that do not appear in the alleged racketeering acts. They also testified that these payments were made to guarantee the flow of confidential law enforcement information from Connolly to members of the enterprise. This testimony provided evidence of an ongoing criminal relationship between Connolly and members of the enterprise, and supported the jury's ultimate finding regarding Connolly's participation in an ongoing association-in-fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, as the government correctly argues, simply because the jury found a specified racketeering act as \"unproven beyond a reasonable doubt\" does not mean that the jury found the evidence relating to that act unpersuasive, in combination with other evidence in the case, on the existence of an association-in-fact enterprise. Rather, it may only mean that the government did not prove a requisite element of the underlying crime alleged as a racketeering act. For example, the district court instructed the jury that in order to prove Act 1 &#8212; that Connolly had accepted a bribe &#8212; the government had to demonstrate that Connolly had \"demanded, sought, or received a thing of value as a quid pro quo, or in return for a promise, implicit or stated, to do or omit to do a particular act in violation of his lawful duty.\" In returning a finding of \"unproven,\" the jury could have concluded that the evidence underlying Act 1, while failing to demonstrate this requisite quid pro quo, nevertheless demonstrated a corrupt gratuity evidencing the existence of an illegal enterprise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Likewise, Racketeering Act 7, as described on the verdict sheet, alleged that Connolly had committed obstruction of justice by \"alerting Bulger that Richard Castucci was an informant.\" The district court instructed the jury that in order to prove obstruction of justice, the government had to demonstrate that Connolly had knowingly endeavored to obstruct or impede a pending judicial proceeding. The court also instructed the jury that \"[a] judicial proceeding is pending once a grand jury, for example, begins its investigation or when an indictment has been returned.\" The jury might have concluded, however, that Connolly leaked information regarding Castucci for the purpose of frustrating an FBI investigation, and not to obstruct the grand jury proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hence, the fact that nine of the fourteen enumerated racketeering acts were found \"unproven\" does not compel a finding of no continuity in the enterprise. The evidence relating to those acts remained available to the jury in its evaluation of the enterprise element of the RICO charge. <i>Cf. United States v. Vastola,</i> 899 F.2d 211, 222 (3d Cir.) (holding that findings of not guilty on three of four alleged predicate racketeering acts do not mandate judgment of acquittal on RICO count), <i>vacated on other grounds,</i> 497 U.S. 1001, 110 S.Ct. 3233, 111 L.Ed.2d 744 (1990). That being so, the inquiry on appeal is whether the jury, in light of the totality of the evidence, was presented with sufficient evidence of \"continuity\" to support a conviction. <i>See United States v. Powell,</i> 469 U.S. 57, 67, 105 S.Ct. 471, 83 L.Ed.2d 461 (1984). Given the testimony of Weeks, Martorano, and others recounting a regular course of criminal conduct over two decades, we have no difficulty in concluding that the government satisfied its burden on this point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. Organization</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Connolly next argues that the government failed to adduce sufficient evidence demonstrating \"that the members of the alleged enterprise had functioned as a continuing <i>unit</i>\" (original emphasis). Rather, as Connolly characterizes it, the evidence demonstrated, at most, \"the sporadic occurrence of [criminal racketeering] activity\" by a group that had \"no name, no regular business or activities, no cohesion over time, no sense of membership or ongoing association, no sharing of resources or revenues, [and] no systemic linkage or coordination of activities.\" Hence, according to Connolly, there were \"no indicia of an organization\" and, therefore, no \"enterprise.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree with Connolly's appraisal of the evidence, as well as his reading of the term \"enterprise.\" The evidence showed that Connolly, Bulger, Flemmi, Salemme, and others worked together in an association-in-fact enterprise over a period of almost two decades, joining forces to protect themselves from prosecution and to further other criminal activities &#8212; some alleged in the indictment, and others not specifically alleged. There was cohesion in the group over time; the membership shared resources and revenues; there was, in fact, a sense of membership.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the meaning of \"enterprise,\" there is no requirement under RICO that an enterprise have an \"ascertainable structure.\" <i>Patrick,</i> 248 F.3d at 19. Indeed, as the Supreme Court noted in <i>Turkette,</i> \"[t]here is no restriction upon the associations embraced by the [statute's] definition,\" <i>Turkette,</i> 452 U.S. at 580, 101 S.Ct. 2524, and \"Congress has instructed us to construe RICO `liberally ... to effectuate its remedial purposes.'\" <i>United States v. London,</i> 66 F.3d 1227, 1243 (1st Cir.1995) (quoting Pub.L. No. 91-452, &#167; 904(a), 84 Stat. 922, 947 (1970) (<i>reprinted in note following</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1961)). Hence an \"enterprise\" need only be \"a group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a criminal course of conduct.\" <i>Owens,</i> 167 F.3d at 751 n. 6; <i>see also Boylan,</i> 898 F.2d at 242 (\"What counts is whether it can be said, on the totality of the evidence, that all of the alleged coconspirators directed their efforts towards the accomplishment of a common goal....\") (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Construing the term \"enterprise\" broadly, as we must, we have no difficulty in concluding that the association-in-fact alleged in the indictment was sufficiently \"organized\" to support a RICO conviction, and that the government had adequately proved the existence of that enterprise to sustain a conviction. Indeed, there was a discernable structure to the enterprise, with members playing designated roles in keeping the enterprise functioning as a viable unit. For example, Martorano could be considered the head of the enterprise's enforcement division, executing individuals who could prove to be a liability. Connolly's role was that of information officer, i.e., an intelligence conduit from law enforcement. Weeks, as Bulger's \"right-hand man,\" managed special funds and functioned as an intermediary between Bulger and others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Connolly insists, however, that Bulger, Flemmi, and others were actually members of the Winter Hill Gang, and that this somehow forecloses the possibility of membership in another enterprise. We fail to follow this logic. As the indictment makes clear, the alleged enterprise in this case &#8212; while perhaps overlapping in membership and some criminal activities with the Winter Hill Gang and even La Cosa Nostra &#8212; was a separate entity, distinguishable from both of these other criminal organizations. Membership in the Winter Hill Gang does not, ipso facto, preclude membership in another criminal enterprise. While the evidence demonstrated that Bulger, Flemmi, and others were associates of the Winter Hill Gang, it also demonstrated that they were members of a separate enterprise dedicated to their own protection and the advancement of their own criminal activities. Moreover, evidence was presented suggesting that the enterprise was distinct (if not totally separate) from the Winter Hill Gang. For example, the jury heard testimony that part of the money that the enterprise's members extorted or otherwise illegally procured was used to pay bribes necessary to ensure the enterprise's survival. Moreover, Bulger told Weeks that Connolly, who was not a member of the Winter Hill Gang, was nevertheless \"one of ours.\" The jury could therefore have readily inferred the existence of a continuing unit which included Connolly and was distinct from the Winter Hill Gang.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. \"Pattern of Racketeering Activity\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. The Predicate Acts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Racketeering Acts 11 and 12 occurred in late 1994 or early 1995 and concerned Connolly's tip-offs to Bulger, Flemmi, and Salemme regarding their indictment. Racketeering Act 13 occurred in March 1997 and concerned the fraudulent, anonymous letter that Connolly sent to Judge Wolf purporting to be from three police officers. Racketeering Act 14 occurred in 1998 and concerns the false testimony that Flemmi gave after being coached and directed by Connolly.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. The Legal Requirements for a Pattern</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the RICO statute does not define in absolute terms what constitutes a \"pattern of racketeering activity,\" it does set a minimum requirement: proof of a pattern of racketeering activity \"requires [proof of] at least two acts of racketeering activity\" within a ten-year period. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1961(5). The Supreme Court, interpreting RICO, has stated that \"while two acts are necessary, they may not be sufficient.\" <i>Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co.,</i> 473 U.S. 479, 496 n. 14, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985). \"It is not the <i>number</i> of predicates\" that determines whether they constitute a pattern of racketeering activity; rather, it is \"the <i>relationship</i> that they bear to each other or to some external organizing principle.\" <i>H.J. Inc.,</i> 492 U.S. at 238, 109 S.Ct. 2893 (emphasis added). The two factors most pertinent to this determination, according to the Court, are relatedness and continuity. <i>See id.</i> at 239, 109 S.Ct. 2893 (\"It is this factor of <i>continuity plus relationship</i> which combines to produce a pattern.\") (original emphasis) (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Continuity, according to the Supreme Court, can refer \"either to a closed period of repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition.\" <i>Id.</i> at 241, 109 S.Ct. 2893. We have previously indicated that it is \"`difficult to formulate in the abstract any general test' for the continuity required for a pattern.\" <i>Apparel Art Int'l v. Jacobson,</i> 967 F.2d 720, 722 (1st Cir.1992) (quoting <i>H.J. Inc.,</i> 492 U.S. at 241, 109 S.Ct. 2893); <i>see also Efron v. Embassy Suites (P.R.), Inc.,</i> 223 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir.2000) (\"We have more than once remarked upon the difficulty of articulating concrete guidelines for this `continuity plus relationship' standard for identifying a pattern.\"). In <i>H.J. Inc.</i> the Supreme Court noted that Congress chose not to define \"pattern of racketeering activity\" with any degree of specificity in the RICO statute. Hence, the Court instructed lower courts to adopt a flexible approach to RICO claims, employing a \"commonsense, everyday understanding of RICO's language and Congress' gloss on it.\" <i>H.J. Inc.</i> 492 U.S. at 241, 109 S.Ct. 2893. Lower courts, in turn, have repeatedly looked to one guidepost contained in <i>H.J. Inc.:</i> \"A party alleging a RICO violation may demonstrate continuity over a closed period by proving a series of related predicates extending over a substantial period of time,\" or by evidence that the acts \"include a specific threat of repetition extending indefinitely into the future.\" <i>Id.</i> at 242, 109 S.Ct. 2893. Because RICO was intended by Congress to apply only to enduring criminal conduct, \"[p]redicate acts extending over a few weeks or months and threatening no future criminal conduct do not satisfy this requirement.\" <i>Id.; Efron,</i> 223 F.3d at 15; <i>Apparel Art,</i> 967 F.2d at 723.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Connolly's Argument</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Connolly concedes that the four racketeering acts at issue are sufficiently related for RICO purposes. Each act served to protect members of the enterprise. Connolly insists, however, that the four racketeering acts simply constituted a \"single criminal episode,\" that they did not present the threat of ongoing conduct, and that they therefore were not a pattern of racketeering activity. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we have previously indicated that \"[w]e can be reasonably certain\" that the pattern requirement \"does <i>not</i> encompass a single criminal episode, a single `crime' (in the ordinary, nontechnical sense of that word),\" <i>Apparel Art,</i> 967 F.2d at 722 (original emphasis), we have also indicated that a \"single criminal episode\" is something narrow in scope and purpose, for example, a single interstate bank robbery. As we explained in <i>Apparel Art,</i> a bank robbery could include several different \"crimes\" (in the technical sense of the word) &#8212; such as gun possession, threatening a teller, stealing a getaway car, and eventually lying about one's participation &#8212; but they nevertheless do not add up to a \"pattern of racketeering activity.\" <i>See id.</i> The instant case, however, is altogether different. Here, there were at least three different \"episodes\" &#8212; the disclosing of the indictment, the fabricated letter, and the perjured testimony &#8212; each planned and executed independently of the others over a period of years, and each the result of detailed planning and scheming by members of a criminal enterprise seeking to impede the criminal prosecutions of their cohorts. This is precisely the kind of activity that RICO was intended to forestall. <i>See H.J. Inc.,</i> 492 U.S. at 247-48, 109 S.Ct. 2893.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the threat of future criminal conduct, the racketeering acts at issue were part of an ongoing criminal enterprise undertaken to facilitate future criminal acts by other members of that enterprise. The enterprise sought to insure that its members would never be brought to justice, and indeed, one of them is still at large. As the government describes it, the enterprise engaged in a \"do-whatever-is-necessary\" long-term pattern of criminal activity that threatened ongoing criminal conduct of the sort that RICO was designed to prevent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> In short, there was ample evidence supporting the jury's conclusion that the government had satisfied the \"pattern of racketeering activity\" element of the crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sentencing Connolly, the district court relied upon the Pre-Sentence Report (\"PSR\") prepared by the U.S. Probation Office. The PSR calculated the appropriate sentence after navigating through a series of cross-references as follows (with the cross-referenced subject matter <i>underlined</i> for the reader's convenience):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; Under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2E1.1, the base offense level for a RICO conviction is the greater of either (i) 19, or (ii) the offense applicable to the <i>underlying</i> <i>racketeering activity,</i> i.e., obstruction of justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; As for the <i>underlying racketeering activity,</i> under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2J1.2, the base offense level for obstruction of justice is 12. Subsection (c), however, indicates that if the obstruction of justice interfered with the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense, the court should look to &#167; 2X3.1 (<i>accessory after the fact</i>) with respect to the criminal offense obstructed, provided that the corresponding offense level is greater than 12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; Section 2X3.1 provides that the base offense level for being an <i>accessory after the fact</i> is 6 levels lower than the offense level for the <i>underlying offense,</i> but in no event less than 4, or more than 30.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; The PSR identified first-degree murder as the <i>underlying offense</i> because (1) Connolly's racketeering activities concerned the obstruction of the prosecution of <i>United States v. Salemme,</i> and (2) the most serious of the underlying offenses charged in the <i>Salemme</i> indictment was <i>first-degree murder.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; Under &#167; 2A1.1, the base offense level for <i>first-degree murder</i> is 43.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under &#167; 2X3.1, however, the maximum base offense level for accessory after the fact is 30. The Probation Office therefore recommended a base offense level of 30. The PSR determined that no adjustment was necessary for the multiple counts, or for any other reason, and that Connolly should be placed in Criminal History Category I. The corresponding sentencing range for Category I, when combined with an offense level of 30, is 97 to 121 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, Connolly challenged the calculation of the offense level, arguing that he was not \"subjectively aware\" of the more serious charges alleged in the <i>Salemme</i> indictment, and that first-degree murder should therefore not be considered the \"underlying offense\" under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2X3.1. The district court properly overruled Connolly's objection. <i>See United States v. McQueen,</i> 86 F.3d 180, 184 (11th Cir.1996) (\"Neither &#167; 2J1.2(c)(1) nor &#167; 2X3.1 requires such knowledge as a prerequisite to application of the offense level for the `underlying offense.'\"). It then adopted the factual findings and the Guidelines calculation contained in the PSR, and sentenced Connolly to the maximum of the applicable range, i.e., 121 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Connolly abandons his subjective knowledge argument and presses a new argument that the district court made a \"basic mistake\" in sentencing when it referenced the murder guideline \"without conducting any fact-finding\" as to what exactly constitutes the \"underlying offense.\" Since Connolly raises this objection for the first time on appeal, we review for plain error only. <i>United States v. Henderson,</i> 320 F.3d 92, 102 (1st Cir.2003); <i>see United States v. Grant,</i> 971 F.2d 799, 803 (1st Cir.1992) (noting that \"as a general rule, appellant may not `switch horses mid-stream' and raise new legal arguments not made the basis for objections in the district court\"). Accordingly, Connolly \"bears the burden of proving (1) an error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\" <i>United States v. Downs-Moses,</i> 329 F.3d 253, 263 (1st Cir.2003). Assuming he can meet this high hurdle, Connolly must then demonstrate that the error \"seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Matos,</i> 328 F.3d 34, 43 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plain language of the applicable sections of the Guidelines does not support Connolly's argument. The obstruction of justice guideline, &#167; 2J1.2(c), provides that: If the offense involved obstructing the investigation or <i>prosecution of a criminal offense,</i> apply &#167; 2X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact) in respect <i>to that criminal offense,</i> if the resulting offense level is greater than that determined above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added). We fail to see how this language obliges an evidentiary inquiry into the substance of \"that criminal offense.\" Moreover, the commentary to section 1B1.5 (governing the interpretation of cross-references) indicates that,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A reference may direct that, if the conduct involved another offense, the offense guideline for such other offense is to be applied.... Where there is more than one such offense, the most serious such offense ... is to be used.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.5, comment. (n.1). The PSR followed these directives to the letter. The jury found that Connolly had obstructed the prosecution in <i>United States v. Salemme</i> at various times from late 1994 to mid-1998, including <i>after</i> the grand jury had returned a superceding indictment charging Flemmi, Bulger, Salemme, and others with a number of crimes, including first-degree murder. The Probation Office reasonably looked to the most serious offense contained in the superseding indictment, and, as explained above, calculated the base offense level at 30.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not to say that a factual inquiry into the underlying offense would never be appropriate. For example, if a defendant were convicted of obstruction of justice for lying in a grand jury proceeding, a sentencing court would be justified in probing deeper into the nature of the underlying offense. Otherwise, the perjurer, through his false testimony, could cause an indictment for a minor (instead of a serious) crime to issue, and then gain the benefit of his perjury if the court were to rely solely on the indictment in determining the underlying offense. The converse, of course, is also true &#8212; an overzealous prosecutor could seek to enhance the perjurer's sentence by spuriously convincing a grand jury to increase the counts in an indictment. Hence, the Fourth Circuit has held that, in such a situation, a factual inquiry into what constitutes the underlying offense would not be inappropriate. <i>See United States v. Dickerson,</i> 114 F.3d 464, 467-68 (4th Cir.1997). The Ninth Circuit, citing <i>Dickerson,</i> indicated in <i>United States v. Arias,</i> 253 F.3d 453 (9th Cir.2001), that a factual inquiry into the underlying offense would be appropriate only if there were a \"<i>genuine</i> dispute\" as to its substance. <i>Id.</i> at 461 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Connolly relies unpersuasively on <i>Dickerson</i> and <i>Arias</i> in pressing his claim. Unlike Dickerson, Connolly did not perjure himself before a grand jury, and there was therefore no risk of over- or undercharging of the indictment. And unlike <i>Arias,</i> there is no <i>genuine</i> dispute in this case as to the underlying offense. When Connolly wrote the fraudulent letter to Judge Wolf, and when he instructed Flemmi on how to lie on the witness stand, the <i>Salemme</i> prosecution included charges of first-degree murder. Moreover, Weeks testified during the trial that Connolly's goal was to get the entire case against Flemmi \"tossed out,\" and substantial evidence adduced at trial supports that conclusion. Finally, even assuming that an inquiry into the underlying offense would be appropriate in this case, and assuming it was error for the district court not to undertake that inquiry <i>sua sponte,</i> any such error would be far from \"plain,\" i.e., \"clear, in the sense that it was obvious.\" <i>United States v. Geronimo,</i> 330 F.3d 67, 74-75 (1st Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, the fact that Connolly, who was ably represented by counsel below, only belatedly turns to this argument, and cites only two cases from other jurisdictions, belies any claim that the error was truly \"obvious.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since Connolly has failed to demonstrate that the district court committed any error &#8212; plain or otherwise &#8212; when it determined that first-degree murder was the \"underlying offense\" for purposes of U.S.S.G. &#167; 2J1.2(c) and &#167; 2X3.1, we affirm the sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the first day of trial, when the jury first entered into the courtroom, the district court judge noticed that one of the jurors was carrying a notebook. Without prompting from counsel, the judge informed the jury as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I noticed one of you came in with a notebook. I just want to alert you that I do not permit note taking. I want you to just sit and listen to the evidence and then use your collective memories as you deliberate at the conclusion of the case. Some very, very fine judges, colleagues, friends of mine, they do permit note taking. I don't. I want you to just sit back and pay attention. So that is the way we will proceed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Connolly did not object to this instruction, nor did he seek clarification or modification of it. The parties do not recall seeing any jurors taking notes in the courtroom over the course of the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Almost a month after the trial had ended, an article appeared in the <i>Boston Globe</i> which stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the judge had prohibited jurors from taking notes during the trial, some jurors went home and jotted down testimony they had heard that day, according to [two jurors]. \"A couple of jurors took notes at night, which was very helpful [during deliberations],\" [one juror] said.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(second modification in original). Arguing that the jury may have relied on \"extraneous prejudicial information\" during deliberations, Connolly filed a motion for an evidentiary inquiry into whether jurors had, in fact, taken notes during trial and whether they had considered any such notes during their deliberations. In a brief order, the district court denied the request:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the first day of trial I told the jurors I did not permit note taking during trial.... I did not, however, forbid the jurors from making notes of their impressions of the evidence when not in court. Indeed, writing material was provided to the jurors in their deliberating room. It was expected that jurors would make notes and use them during their deliberations. There is no occasion for the inquiry requested by Defendant. Defendant's Motion, therefore, is DENIED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Connolly now assigns error to this decision,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> asking that we remand the case for further inquiry into this purported juror \"misconduct.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's response to an allegation of juror misconduct only for abuse of discretion. <i>See United</i> <i>States v. Ortiz-Arrigoitia,</i> 996 F.2d 436, 442 (1st Cir.1993) (indicating that district court has broad discretion to \"determine the nature and extent of its inquiry\" into juror improprieties); <i>Mahoney v. Vondergritt,</i> 938 F.2d 1490, 1492 (1st Cir.1991) (noting that district court judges have \"broad discretion in determining how to respond to allegations of extraneous influence on jurors\"); <i>Boylan,</i> 898 F.2d at 258 (\"[T]he district court has broad discretion to determine the type of investigation which must be mounted.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal Rule of Evidence 606(b) codifies the \"near-universal and firmly established common-law rule\" that prohibits the admission of juror testimony to impeach a jury verdict. <i>Tanner v. United States,</i> 483 U.S. 107, 117, 107 S.Ct. 2739, 97 L.Ed.2d 90 (1987). There are significant policy considerations underlying such a rule, including finality, maintaining the integrity of the jury system, encouraging frank and honest deliberations, and the protection of jurors from subsequent harassment by a losing party. <i>See McDonald v. Pless,</i> 238 U.S. 264, 267-68, 35 S.Ct. 783, 59 L.Ed. 1300 (1915). Rule 606(b) does, however, create an exception to the common-law rule in situations where \"extraneous prejudicial information [is] improperly brought to the jury's attention.\" Fed.R.Evid. 606(b). Despite this exception, we have nevertheless warned that \"[c]ourts generally `should be hesitant[ ] to haul jurors in after they have reached a verdict ... to probe for potential instances of bias, misconduct, or extraneous influences.'\" <i>Neron v. Tierney,</i> 841 F.2d 1197, 1205 (1st Cir.1988) (quoting <i>United States v. Moon,</i> 718 F.2d 1210, 1234 (2d Cir.1983)). A court should only conduct such an inquiry when \"reasonable grounds for investigation exist,\" i.e., \"there is clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific, nonspeculative impropriety has occurred which could have prejudiced the trial of a defendant.\" <i>Moon,</i> 718 F.2d at 1234 (citation omitted). Connolly cannot meet this high standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Boston Globe</i> article indicated that two jurors made notes at home some evenings regarding that day's in-court testimony. We agree with the district court that this note-taking, assuming it actually happened, was not inconsistent with the court's instructions. The judge told the jurors that he wanted them to focus on the testimony, not in-court note-taking: \"I want you to just sit back and pay attention.\" Such a prescript did not foreclose the possibility of note-taking outside of court. Indeed, as the district judge noted, the jurors were provided with writing materials in the jury room from the outset of trial. Hence, the note-taking described in the <i>Globe</i> article did not constitute juror misconduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, assuming that any notes actually made their way into the jury room during deliberations,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> the notes cannot be considered an \"extraneous\" or \"extrinsic\" influence. In <i>Bassler,</i> the district court instructed the jury at the beginning of the trial that note-taking was not permitted. Like the two jurors in Connolly's trial, one of the <i>Bassler</i> jurors understood this instruction to mean that \"no notes should be taken during the actual trial time but could be taken during recess or other times outside actual trial time.\" <i>Id.</i> at 602. The juror therefore took notes at the end of each day, and these notes eventually found their way into the jury room during deliberations. The <i>Bassler</i> court held that the juror's daily notes could not be considered an improper \"extrinsic influence\" because they were, in fact, <i>intrinsic.</i> We agree, and \"[i]ntrinsic influences on a jury's verdict are not competent to impeach a verdict.\" <i>Id.</i> Hence Connolly cannot rely on the notes to demonstrate prejudice. <i>Cf. United States v. Balsam,</i> 203 F.3d 72, 86 (1st Cir.2000) (indicating that sharing of notes in open court by jurors does \"not raise the same specter of prejudice as improper <i>outside</i> influences upon the jury\") (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the notes could, somehow, be considered \"extrinsic,\" Connolly falls far short of providing specifics regarding any prejudice. Instead, he only insists that the district court should have conducted \"an inquiry.\" Tellingly, he does not suggest what form this inquiry should take. Rather, he simply asks that we remand with instructions to the district court to \"do what has to be done to ferret out the truth.\" He does not identify any witnesses he would call at an evidentiary hearing, or what the substance of any testimony could possibly be. Indeed, Connolly has made no proffer of <i>any</i> evidence other than the <i>Boston Globe</i> article. Instead, there is only speculation, and mere speculation can hardly be considered \"clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence.\" <i>Moon,</i> 718 F.2d at 1234.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have repeatedly said that courts should respond to allegations of juror impropriety in a manner appropriate to the facts and circumstances at hand. <i>See Ortiz-Arrigoitia,</i> 996 F.2d at 443 (\"The trial judge is not ... shackled to a rigid and unyielding set [of] rules and procedures that compel any particular form or scope of inquiry.\"); <i>Boylan,</i> 898 F.2d at 258 (\"We abjure imposition of a rigid set of rules for the conduct of inquiries into the presence or extent of extrinsic influences.\"); <i>see also Moon,</i> 718 F.2d at 1234 (\"[E]ach situation in this area is <i>sui generis.</i>\"). Since we agree with the district court's conclusion that its instructions to the jury did not preclude note-taking outside the courtroom, and since Connolly has failed to make any substantial evidentiary showing regarding prejudicial impropriety, the district court properly exercised its discretion in denying Connolly's motion for further inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of conviction entered on the jury's verdict and the sentence of the district court are <i>AFFIRMED.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>SO ORDERED.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Connolly does not appeal his convictions for obstruction of justice and making a false statement</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The indictment also named Bulger as a defendant on one count.

Act 6 pertained to Connolly's involvement in the extortion of Rakes. Acts 7 through 9 concerned Connolly's sharing of confidential law enforcement information that led to the killings of Castucci, Callahan, and Halloran. Act 10 alleged that Connolly, working with Morris, had informed Bulger and Flemmi of a court-authorized wiretap and an ongoing grand jury investigation into illegal gambling activity. Racketeering Acts 11 through 14 allegedly took place during the period 1994 to 1998, after Connolly had retired from the FBI. All four involved obstruction of justice surrounding the<i>United States v. Salemme</i> case and are discussed in more detail in Part II.B below.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Several of the Acts were broken down into subparts, each one having the same factual basis. For example, the indictment divided the sixth Racketeering Act into Act 6A and 6B, \"either one of which alone constitutes Racketeering Act 6.\" As described on the verdict sheet, Act 6A accused Connolly of \"aiding and abetting the extortion of Julie and Stephen Rakes,\" while 6B accused him of \"aiding and abetting a conspiracy to extort Julie and Stephen Rakes.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> In evaluating Connolly's argument regarding the \"pattern of racketeering activity\" element, we do not rely on the \"unproven\" Racketeering Acts (1 through 3 and 5 through 10) described in note 4, supra. The Third Circuit, however, has indicated that a reviewing court need not be constrained by the jury's findings regarding the individual racketeering acts in determining whether the evidence, taken as a whole, supports an ultimate finding of guilt through a \"pattern of racketeering activity.\"<i>See Vastola,</i> 899 F.2d at 222-23. Since the \"proven\" racketeering acts (11 through 15) establish the requisite pattern, we need not consider whether other evidence adduced at trial supports such a finding.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The Second Circuit has noted that courts have been quicker to find RICO violations \"in cases where the acts of the defendant or the enterprise were inherently unlawful, such as murder or obstruction of justice, and were in pursuit of inherently unlawful goals.\"<i>United States v. Aulicino,</i> 44 F.3d 1102, 1111 (2d Cir.1995). We agree with the common-sense conclusion that in such situations, there is a greater threat of future criminal conduct. Of course, as explained in the text, there is no hard and fast rule, and the fact that there may be \"inherently unlawful\" conduct underlying the RICO charge would not prevent us from concluding that there was nevertheless no pattern of racketeering activity. <i>See, e.g., Miranda v.

Connolly, Jr., guilty of one count of racketeering under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\"), 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1962(c), two counts of obstruction of justice, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1503, and one count of making false statements, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1001. The district court subsequently imposed a sentence of 121 months of imprisonment, followed by a two-year period of supervised release. Connolly now appeals his RICO conviction, arguing that he is entitled to a judgment of acquittal on the RICO charge because the government failed to prove two critical elements of its RICO charge &#8212; participation in an \"enterprise,\" and a \"pattern of racketeering activity.\" <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1961(4), (5) (defining \"enterprise\" and \"pattern of racketeering activity\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Connolly also appeals his sentence, arguing that the district court erred in its calculation of the applicable offense level pursuant to sections 2E1.1, 2J1.2, and 2X3.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\"U.S.S.G.\" or \"Guidelines\"). Finally, Connolly argues that the district court erred when it denied his request to convene a post-verdict evidentiary hearing to inquire into the propriety of alleged note-taking by jurors. He asks that we remand the case to the district court for an inquiry into possible juror misconduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finding no reason to disturb Connolly's conviction or sentence or to remand to the district court, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We provide some general background facts here, saving our more detailed discussion of the evidence for our assessment in Part II of Connolly's claims of evidentiary insufficiency. Connolly joined the FBI in 1968; from 1973 until 1990 he served as an agent in the Bureau's Boston office. During his tenure, he was responsible for handling several high-ranking, confidential informants with connections to two criminal syndicates &#8212; the Winter Hill Gang, and the New England branch of La Cosa Nostra. According to the government, the Winter Hill Gang is a \"clandestine criminal organization engaged in multiple crimes, including murder, bribery, extortion, loan sharking, and illegal gambling in the greater Boston, Massachusetts area.\" La Casa Nostra &#8212; a considerably larger, better known, and more established criminal organization &#8212; similarly engages in illegal activities in and around Boston. Despite the fact that the Winter Hill Gang and La Cosa Nostra were often rivals, members of the two groups frequently cooperated in criminal undertakings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two of the informants for whom Connolly was responsible, James Bulger and Stephen Flemmi, were members of the Winter Hill Gang. Bulger and Flemmi reported on the activities of both the Gang and La Cosa Nostra for over a decade. Shortly after Connolly retired from the FBI in 1990, however, Bulger and Flemmi were \"closed\" as FBI informants &#8212; i.e., the FBI no longer desired their services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Bulger and Flemmi ceased to serve as informants, their involvement with the Gang's criminal activities nonetheless continued. For example, at some point in the early 1990s, Flemmi, working with the \"boss\" of La Cosa Nostra's Boston family, Frank Salemme, ran an illegal \"numbers\" operation in the Boston area. On January 10, 1995, a federal grand jury indicted Bulger, Flemmi, Salemme, and several other persons for multiple counts of illegal gambling, extortion, assault, bribery, obstruction of justice, loansharking, and RICO violations. <i>See United States v. Salemme,</i> No. 94-CR-10287-MLW-2 (D.Mass. Jan. 10, 1995) (indictment). Flemmi was quickly arrested and taken into custody. Bulger and Salemme, however, forewarned of the pending indictment, disappeared a few days before its issuance. The authorities apprehended Salemme eight months later. Bulger remains at large.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The instant criminal proceeding began in December 1999, when another federal grand jury indicted Flemmi and Connolly on charges of racketeering, obstruction of justice, and conspiracy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> A superceding indictment was filed in October 2000 with additional charges of obstruction of justice and making a false statement. According to the superceding indictment, Connolly had led a double-life for over two decades. While serving as an FBI agent, Connolly had been intimately involved in the criminal activities of the Winter Hill Gang and its members, receiving and making bribes from and on behalf of members of the Gang. Even after his retirement from the Bureau, Connolly allegedly continued to exploit his connections within the Bureau to become privy to confidential information that he would then pass along to members of the Winter Hill Gang.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Specifically, the superceding indictment included nine counts, which we summarize as follows: <i>Counts 1 &amp; 2</i> &#8212; RICO and Conspiracy to Violate RICO, alleging that Connolly had, through a pattern of racketeering activity, participated in the affairs of an association-in-fact enterprise whose members included Bulger, Flemmi, himself, and unidentified others. The purpose of the enterprise was to protect Bulger, Flemmi, and their associates (including Salemme and members of the Winter Hill Gang) from arrest and prosecution, and to facilitate their criminal activities. The two counts detail fourteen different \"racketeering acts,\" including allegations of bribery, extortion, and obstruction of justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Count 3</i> &#8212; Conspiracy to Obstruct Justice, alleging that Connolly and Flemmi, together with others, had conspired to obstruct justice in the prosecution of Bulger, Flemmi, and Salemme in <i>United States v.

Salemme.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flemmi ultimately pleaded guilty to Counts 3 and 5 (the only two counts in which he was named) and was sentenced to 41 months of imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 2002, the trial against Connolly began on Counts 1, 4, 6, 7, and 9.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> At the close of the government's case and at the close of all of the evidence, Connolly moved for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 29. The court denied the motions. The jury returned guilty verdicts against Connolly on four of the five counts at issue &#8212; Counts 1, 6, 7 and 9 &#8212; and acquitted on Count 4. Connolly renewed his Rule 29 motion after the verdict, and the court once again denied it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 16, 2002, the district court sentenced Connolly to a term of incarceration of 121 months followed by a two-year period of supervised release. The district court denied Connolly's request for release on bail pending appeal, and we denied a similar, subsequent application. We now address Connolly's arguments of error by the trial court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Connolly claims that he is entitled to a judgment of acquittal on the RICO count because the government failed to present sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt two essential elements of the RICO charge: (1) Connolly's participation in an \"enterprise,\" and (2) a \"pattern of racketeering activity,\" as defined by statute and applicable case law. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1961(4), (5).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In evaluating a claim of insufficiency of the evidence, we review the record de novo, and \"[w]e will affirm the conviction if, `after assaying all the evidence in the light most amiable to the government, and taking all reasonable inferences in its favor, a rational factfinder could find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the prosecution successfully proved the essential elements of the crime.'\" <i>United States v.

Against this backdrop, we now turn to Connolly's specific claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>A. \"Enterprise\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. The Charge</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Count 1 of the superceding indictment alleged that Connolly, Bulger, Flemmi, and others were members of an \"enterprise,\" that is to say, \"a group of individuals associated in fact,\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1961(4), and that this enterprise,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">through its members and associates, acted to protect James Bulger, Stephen Flemmi and their associates, including Francis P. Salemme and those in the Winter Hill Gang, from arrest and prosecution for criminal activities including murder, loan sharking, illegal gambling, extortion, obstruction of justice, and bribery; and it acted to facilitate those criminal activities of Bulger, Flemmi, and their associates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The indictment further alleged that the enterprise protected and fostered its members' criminal activities by</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) providing Bulger and Flemmi with confidential law enforcement information regarding Grand Jury investigations, court-authorized electronic surveillance, and other investigative efforts; (2) deflecting and squelching prosecutions and criminal investigations of their crimes; and (3) improperly preserving their status as FBI informants through the filing of misleading official reports and by failing to report information relating to Bulger and Flemmi which was material to the investigation of criminal activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The indictment distinguishes this association-in-fact enterprise from the Winter Hill Gang and La Cosa Nostra, though individual affiliations do overlap. The indictment also alleges that members of the enterprise committed fourteen different \"racketeering acts,\" which included several acts of bribery, obstruction of justice, and extortion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. The Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kevin Weeks, who identified himself as Bulger's \"right-hand man,\" was the government's star witness and provided substantial testimony regarding the existence of the enterprise. For example, Weeks testified that a special fund was created from some of the proceeds of Bulger's and Flemmi's criminal activities, and that Connolly received cash payments from that fund in exchange for a regular flow of information about law enforcement activities that might affect the group. Additionally, Weeks testified that Connolly was the enterprise's contact in the FBI, and that Bulger had given Connolly money in return for protecting the enterprise. According to Weeks, Bulger told him that Connolly was \"one of ours.\" John Martorano, a member of the Winter Hill Gang, corroborated Weeks's testimony regarding Connolly's repeated receipt of gratuities in exchange for information. Salemme likewise testified that he and Flemmi had twice set aside $5000 from the proceeds of their numbers racket to pay Connolly for the information he provided.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In return for these payments, Connolly provided a wealth of sensitive information, often with dire consequences. For example, Martorano testified that Connolly told Bulger that an informant named Richard Castucci had provided the FBI with information regarding the whereabouts of two fugitive Winter Hill members. Bulger told Martorano of the leak, and Martorano in turn murdered Castucci in order to silence him. Martorano also testified that Connolly had told Bulger and others that another informant, Brian Halloran, had implicated Martorano in the murder of a recalcitrant associate, Roger Wheeler. Weeks testified that Bulger, upon learning from Connolly of Halloran's betrayal, ambushed Halloran as he got into a car outside a Boston restaurant, and fatally shot both Halloran and the driver, Michael Donahue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Martorano also testified that Connolly told Bulger and Flemmi that the FBI agents who had been working with Halloran were going to put pressure on another associate, John Callahan, to come clean about the Wheeler murder. According to Martorano, Connolly told Bulger and Flemmi that they were \"all going to go to jail for the rest of our life if something doesn't happen to John Callahan.\" Worried about the possibility of a breach, Bulger and Flemmi convinced Martorano that Callahan had to be silenced. In an effort to deflect any attention away from the ongoing Boston investigation, Martorano lured Callahan to Florida where, with another associate, he murdered Callahan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Weeks also testified that he and Bulger had extorted a person named Stephen Rakes into selling them a South Boston liquor store. After Weeks had forcibly acquired ownership of the store, Rakes's wife went to her uncle, Joseph Lundbohm, who was a detective in the Boston Police Department. Lundbohm testified that he, in turn, went to Connolly with the problem, and Connolly stated that nothing could be done unless Rakes agreed to wear a recording device. Lundbohm, out of fear for the safety of his niece and her husband, told Connolly that wearing a wire would be unacceptable. Connolly did not take any action to stop the extortionate takeover, nor did he report the incident to his superiors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for Connolly's efforts to derail the <i>United States v. Salemme</i> prosecution, Weeks testified that on December 23, 1994, Connolly came to the South Boston liquor store that Weeks and Bulger had extorted from the Rakes, looking for Bulger. Only Weeks was on the premises, however, and Connolly led him to the inside of the walk-in refrigerator at the back of the store where electronic surveillance would be difficult. There, Connolly told Weeks that he had just learned that federal indictments were pending against Bulger and Flemmi and that agents planned to make arrests over the holidays. Even though Connolly no longer worked at the FBI, he told Weeks that he was certain of this information because it had come from then-FBI Assistant Special Agent in Charge Dennis O'Callaghan. Connolly also indicated that only four people in the FBI knew about the pending indictment. Connolly instructed Weeks to pass along the information to Bulger and Flemmi immediately. Weeks did so. Flemmi, in turn, passed along the information to Salemme. Bulger and Salemme both skipped town and managed to avoid arrest. Salemme was ultimately arrested eight months later. Bulger's whereabouts remain unknown.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Weeks also testified that he and Connolly had worked together to compose a letter that they submitted anonymously to Judge Mark Wolf, the United States District Judge presiding over the <i>United States v. Salemme</i> case. The letter, printed on Boston Police Department letterhead, claimed to be from three disgruntled Boston Police Officers, and stated that the wiretaps the government was planning to use in its prosecution had been illegally obtained. Judge Wolf testified that the letter had caused him to order the parties to submit briefs, to hold a number of pretrial hearings, and to hear testimony on the contents of the letter. Weeks testified that Connolly eventually told him the identities of the confidential informants who had worn the concealed recorder, and Weeks passed along this information to Flemmi and Salemme in jail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Weeks testified that Connolly feared that Flemmi would divulge Connolly's involvement in the enterprise and name him as the person who had leaked the news of the indictments. Connolly, through Weeks, convinced Flemmi to testify that Connolly's former FBI supervisor, John Morris, had tipped him off about the indictments. However, Morris had been transferred out of Boston in 1991, long before the indictment issued. According to Weeks, Connolly advised Weeks that Flemmi should testify that Morris had learned of the impending indictments through what is known as a \"pros memo\" (i.e., prosecution memo) that Morris had seen while in Washington. Flemmi ultimately testified to that effect during hearings before Judge Wolf.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. The Legal Requirements for an Enterprise</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Supreme Court indicated in <i>Turkette,</i> the government is required to prove both the existence of an \"enterprise\" and a \"pattern of racketeering activity.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The enterprise is an entity, for present purposes a group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct. The pattern of racketeering activity is, on the other hand, a series of criminal acts as defined by the statute. The former is proved by evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and by evidence that the various associates function as a continuing unit. The latter is proved by evidence of the requisite number of acts of racketeering committed by the participants in the enterprise. While the proof used to establish these separate elements may in particular cases coalesce, proof of one does not necessarily establish the other. The \"enterprise\" is not the \"pattern of racketeering activity\"; it is an entity separate and apart from the pattern of activity in which it engages. The existence of an enterprise at all times remains a separate element which must be proved by the Government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Turkette,</i> 452 U.S. at 583, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110529\"><a href=\"/opinion/110529/united-states-v-turkette/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Connolly's Arguments</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. Continuity</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Connolly argues that the evidence failed to demonstrate \"that the members of the alleged enterprise had functioned as an <i>ongoing</i> organization\" (original emphasis). In pressing this claim, he focuses on the fourteen racketeering acts alleged in the indictment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> These fourteen acts were submitted to the jury for a determination of \"proven beyond a reasonable doubt\" or \"not proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Of the fourteen, the jury found nine of them \"not proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Of the racketeering acts found by the jury to be \"proven beyond a reasonable doubt,\" one was an act of bribery in 1982 or 1983, and the other were four acts of obstruction of justice in the mid- to late-1990s in connection with the <i>United States v. Salemme</i> prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Connolly cites these findings to argue that the government had failed to prove \"continuity\" in the enterprise, i.e., that the enterprise had functioned as an ongoing organization over the period of time alleged, from September 1975 to September 1998. Since the jury found that all but one of the alleged racketeering acts dating from the 1970s and 1980s had not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, Connolly argues that there was an insufficient basis for the jury to conclude that Connolly was part of an <i>ongoing</i> criminal enterprise. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Pelullo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583598\"><a href=\"/opinion/583598/united-states-v-leonard-a-pelullo/\"><span class=\"volume\">964</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></a></span>, 212 (3d Cir.1992) (noting that RICO enterprises should be \"distinguished from individuals who associate for the commission of sporadic harm\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject this argument for two reasons. First, the government introduced significant evidence of the existence of the enterprise apart from the specified racketeering acts. For example, Weeks, Martorano, and Salemme testified about several payments made to Connolly over the period in question that do not appear in the alleged racketeering acts. They also testified that these payments were made to guarantee the flow of confidential law enforcement information from Connolly to members of the enterprise. This testimony provided evidence of an ongoing criminal relationship between Connolly and members of the enterprise, and supported the jury's ultimate finding regarding Connolly's participation in an ongoing association-in-fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, as the government correctly argues, simply because the jury found a specified racketeering act as \"unproven beyond a reasonable doubt\" does not mean that the jury found the evidence relating to that act unpersuasive, in combination with other evidence in the case, on the existence of an association-in-fact enterprise. Rather, it may only mean that the government did not prove a requisite element of the underlying crime alleged as a racketeering act. For example, the district court instructed the jury that in order to prove Act 1 &#8212; that Connolly had accepted a bribe &#8212; the government had to demonstrate that Connolly had \"demanded, sought, or received a thing of value as a quid pro quo, or in return for a promise, implicit or stated, to do or omit to do a particular act in violation of his lawful duty.\" In returning a finding of \"unproven,\" the jury could have concluded that the evidence underlying Act 1, while failing to demonstrate this requisite quid pro quo, nevertheless demonstrated a corrupt gratuity evidencing the existence of an illegal enterprise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Likewise, Racketeering Act 7, as described on the verdict sheet, alleged that Connolly had committed obstruction of justice by \"alerting Bulger that Richard Castucci was an informant.\" The district court instructed the jury that in order to prove obstruction of justice, the government had to demonstrate that Connolly had knowingly endeavored to obstruct or impede a pending judicial proceeding. The court also instructed the jury that \"[a] judicial proceeding is pending once a grand jury, for example, begins its investigation or when an indictment has been returned.\" The jury might have concluded, however, that Connolly leaked information regarding Castucci for the purpose of frustrating an FBI investigation, and not to obstruct the grand jury proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hence, the fact that nine of the fourteen enumerated racketeering acts were found \"unproven\" does not compel a finding of no continuity in the enterprise. The evidence relating to those acts remained available to the jury in its evaluation of the enterprise element of the RICO charge. <i>Cf. United States v. Vastola,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538812\"><a href=\"/opinion/538812/united-states-of-america-at-nos-89-53725383-at-no-89-5510-v-gaetano/\"><span class=\"volume\">899</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">211</span></a></span>, 222 (3d Cir.)

That being so, the inquiry on appeal is whether the jury, in light of the totality of the evidence, was presented with sufficient evidence of \"continuity\" to support a conviction. <i>See United States v. Powell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111286\"><a href=\"/opinion/111286/united-states-v-powell/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span>, 67, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111286\"><a href=\"/opinion/111286/united-states-v-powell/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">461</span></a></span> (1984). Given the testimony of Weeks, Martorano, and others recounting a regular course of criminal conduct over two decades, we have no difficulty in concluding that the government satisfied its burden on this point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b.

Rather, as Connolly characterizes it, the evidence demonstrated, at most, \"the sporadic occurrence of [criminal racketeering] activity\" by a group that had \"no name, no regular business or activities, no cohesion over time, no sense of membership or ongoing association, no sharing of resources or revenues, [and] no systemic linkage or coordination of activities.\" Hence, according to Connolly, there were \"no indicia of an organization\" and, therefore, no \"enterprise.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree with Connolly's appraisal of the evidence, as well as his reading of the term \"enterprise.\" The evidence showed that Connolly, Bulger, Flemmi, Salemme, and others worked together in an association-in-fact enterprise over a period of almost two decades, joining forces to protect themselves from prosecution and to further other criminal activities &#8212; some alleged in the indictment, and others not specifically alleged. There was cohesion in the group over time; the membership shared resources and revenues; there was, in fact, a sense of membership.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the meaning of \"enterprise,\" there is no requirement under RICO that an enterprise have an \"ascertainable structure.\" <i>Patrick,</i> 248 F.3d at 19. Indeed, as the Supreme Court noted in <i>Turkette,</i> \"[t]here is no restriction upon the associations embraced by the [statute's] definition,\" <i>Turkette,</i> 452 U.S. at 580, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110529\"><a href=\"/opinion/110529/united-states-v-turkette/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

No. 91-452, &#167; 904(a), 84 Stat. 922, 947 (1970) (<i>reprinted in note following</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1961)). Hence an \"enterprise\" need only be \"a group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a criminal course of conduct.\" <i>Owens,</i> 167 F.3d at 751 n. 6; <i>see also Boylan,</i> 898 F.2d at 242 (\"What counts is whether it can be said, on the totality of the evidence, that all of the alleged coconspirators directed their efforts towards the accomplishment of a common goal....\") (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Construing the term \"enterprise\" broadly, as we must, we have no difficulty in concluding that the association-in-fact alleged in the indictment was sufficiently \"organized\" to support a RICO conviction, and that the government had adequately proved the existence of that enterprise to sustain a conviction. Indeed, there was a discernable structure to the enterprise, with members playing designated roles in keeping the enterprise functioning as a viable unit. For example, Martorano could be considered the head of the enterprise's enforcement division, executing individuals who could prove to be a liability. Connolly's role was that of information officer, i.e., an intelligence conduit from law enforcement. Weeks, as Bulger's \"right-hand man,\" managed special funds and functioned as an intermediary between Bulger and others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Connolly insists, however, that Bulger, Flemmi, and others were actually members of the Winter Hill Gang, and that this somehow forecloses the possibility of membership in another enterprise. We fail to follow this logic. As the indictment makes clear, the alleged enterprise in this case &#8212; while perhaps overlapping in membership and some criminal activities with the Winter Hill Gang and even La Cosa Nostra &#8212; was a separate entity, distinguishable from both of these other criminal organizations. Membership in the Winter Hill Gang does not, ipso facto, preclude membership in another criminal enterprise. While the evidence demonstrated that Bulger, Flemmi, and others were associates of the Winter Hill Gang, it also demonstrated that they were members of a separate enterprise dedicated to their own protection and the advancement of their own criminal activities. Moreover, evidence was presented suggesting that the enterprise was distinct (if not totally separate) from the Winter Hill Gang. For example, the jury heard testimony that part of the money that the enterprise's members extorted or otherwise illegally procured was used to pay bribes necessary to ensure the enterprise's survival. Moreover, Bulger told Weeks that Connolly, who was not a member of the Winter Hill Gang, was nevertheless \"one of ours.\" The jury could therefore have readily inferred the existence of a continuing unit which included Connolly and was distinct from the Winter Hill Gang.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. \"Pattern of Racketeering Activity\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1.

We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we have previously indicated that \"[w]e can be reasonably certain\" that the pattern requirement \"does <i>not</i> encompass a single criminal episode, a single `crime' (in the ordinary, nontechnical sense of that word),\" <i>Apparel Art,</i> 967 F.2d at 722 (original emphasis), we have also indicated that a \"single criminal episode\" is something narrow in scope and purpose, for example, a single interstate bank robbery. As we explained in <i>Apparel Art,</i> a bank robbery could include several different \"crimes\" (in the technical sense of the word) &#8212; such as gun possession, threatening a teller, stealing a getaway car, and eventually lying about one's participation &#8212; but they nevertheless do not add up to a \"pattern of racketeering activity.\" <i>See id.</i> The instant case, however, is altogether different. Here, there were at least three different \"episodes\" &#8212; the disclosing of the indictment, the fabricated letter, and the perjured testimony &#8212; each planned and executed independently of the others over a period of years, and each the result of detailed planning and scheming by members of a criminal enterprise seeking to impede the criminal prosecutions of their cohorts. This is precisely the kind of activity that RICO was intended to forestall. <i>See H.J.

The enterprise sought to insure that its members would never be brought to justice, and indeed, one of them is still at large. As the government describes it, the enterprise engaged in a \"do-whatever-is-necessary\" long-term pattern of criminal activity that threatened ongoing criminal conduct of the sort that RICO was designed to prevent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> In short, there was ample evidence supporting the jury's conclusion that the government had satisfied the \"pattern of racketeering activity\" element of the crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sentencing Connolly, the district court relied upon the Pre-Sentence Report (\"PSR\") prepared by the U.S. Probation Office. The PSR calculated the appropriate sentence after navigating through a series of cross-references as follows (with the cross-referenced subject matter <i>underlined</i> for the reader's convenience):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; Under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2E1.1, the base offense level for a RICO conviction is the greater of either (i) 19, or (ii) the offense applicable to the <i>underlying</i> <i>racketeering activity,</i> i.e., obstruction of justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; As for the <i>underlying racketeering activity,</i> under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2J1.2, the base offense level for obstruction of justice is 12. Subsection (c), however, indicates that if the obstruction of justice interfered with the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense, the court should look to &#167; 2X3.1 (<i>accessory after the fact</i>) with respect to the criminal offense obstructed, provided that the corresponding offense level is greater than 12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; Section 2X3.1 provides that the base offense level for being an <i>accessory after the fact</i> is 6 levels lower than the offense level for the <i>underlying offense,</i> but in no event less than 4, or more than 30.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; The PSR identified first-degree murder as the <i>underlying offense</i> because (1) Connolly's racketeering activities concerned the obstruction of the prosecution of <i>United States v. Salemme,</i> and (2) the most serious of the underlying offenses charged in the <i>Salemme</i> indictment was <i>first-degree murder.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; Under &#167; 2A1.1, the base offense level for <i>first-degree murder</i> is 43.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under &#167; 2X3.1, however, the maximum base offense level for accessory after the fact is 30. The Probation Office therefore recommended a base offense level of 30. The PSR determined that no adjustment was necessary for the multiple counts, or for any other reason, and that Connolly should be placed in Criminal History Category I. The corresponding sentencing range for Category I, when combined with an offense level of 30, is 97 to 121 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, Connolly challenged the calculation of the offense level, arguing that he was not \"subjectively aware\" of the more serious charges alleged in the <i>Salemme</i> indictment, and that first-degree murder should therefore not be considered the \"underlying offense\" under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2X3.1. The district court properly overruled Connolly's objection. <i>See United States v. McQueen,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"719714\"><a href=\"/opinion/719714/united-states-v-darrell-mcqueen/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">180</span></a></span>, 184 (11th Cir.1996) (\"Neither &#167; 2J1.2(c)(1) nor &#167; 2X3.1 requires such knowledge as a prerequisite to application of the offense level for the `underlying offense.'\"). It then adopted the factual findings and the Guidelines calculation contained in the PSR, and sentenced Connolly to the maximum of the applicable range, i.e., 121 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Connolly abandons his subjective knowledge argument and presses a new argument that the district court made a \"basic mistake\" in sentencing when it referenced the murder guideline \"without conducting any fact-finding\" as to what exactly constitutes the \"underlying offense.\" Since Connolly raises this objection for the first time on appeal, we review for plain error only. <i>United States v. Henderson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200345\"><a href=\"/opinion/200345/united-states-v-henderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">320</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">92</span></a></span>, 102 (1st Cir.2003); <i>see United States v.

Accordingly, Connolly \"bears the burden of proving (1) an error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\" <i>United States v.

Assuming he can meet this high hurdle, Connolly must then demonstrate that the error \"seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Matos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200455\"><a href=\"/opinion/200455/united-states-v-mariel-figueroa/\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 43 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plain language of the applicable sections of the Guidelines does not support Connolly's argument. The obstruction of justice guideline, &#167; 2J1.2(c), provides that: If the offense involved obstructing the investigation or <i>prosecution of a criminal offense,</i> apply &#167; 2X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact) in respect <i>to that criminal offense,</i> if the resulting offense level is greater than that determined above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added). We fail to see how this language obliges an evidentiary inquiry into the substance of \"that criminal offense.\" Moreover, the commentary to section 1B1.5 (governing the interpretation of cross-references) indicates that,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A reference may direct that, if the conduct involved another offense, the offense guideline for such other offense is to be applied.... Where there is more than one such offense, the most serious such offense ... is to be used.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.5, comment. (n.1). The PSR followed these directives to the letter. The jury found that Connolly had obstructed the prosecution in <i>United States v. Salemme</i> at various times from late 1994 to mid-1998, including <i>after</i> the grand jury had returned a superceding indictment charging Flemmi, Bulger, Salemme, and others with a number of crimes, including first-degree murder. The Probation Office reasonably looked to the most serious offense contained in the superseding indictment, and, as explained above, calculated the base offense level at 30.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not to say that a factual inquiry into the underlying offense would never be appropriate. For example, if a defendant were convicted of obstruction of justice for lying in a grand jury proceeding, a sentencing court would be justified in probing deeper into the nature of the underlying offense. Otherwise, the perjurer, through his false testimony, could cause an indictment for a minor (instead of a serious) crime to issue, and then gain the benefit of his perjury if the court were to rely solely on the indictment in determining the underlying offense. The converse, of course, is also true &#8212; an overzealous prosecutor could seek to enhance the perjurer's sentence by spuriously convincing a grand jury to increase the counts in an indictment. Hence, the Fourth Circuit has held that, in such a situation, a factual inquiry into what constitutes the underlying offense would not be inappropriate. <i>See United States v. Dickerson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"741077\"><a href=\"/opinion/741077/united-states-v-christopher-dickerson-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">464</span></a></span>, 467-68 (4th Cir.1997). The Ninth Circuit, citing <i>Dickerson,</i> indicated in <i>United States v. Arias,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773637\"><a href=\"/opinion/773637/united-states-v-carlos-ernesto-arias-aka-carlos-queida-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">253</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">453</span></a></span> (9th Cir.2001), that a factual inquiry into the underlying offense would be appropriate only if there were a \"<i>genuine</i> dispute\" as to its substance. <i>Id.</i> at 461 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Connolly relies unpersuasively on <i>Dickerson</i> and <i>Arias</i> in pressing his claim. Unlike Dickerson, Connolly did not perjure himself before a grand jury, and there was therefore no risk of over- or undercharging of the indictment. And unlike <i>Arias,</i> there is no <i>genuine</i> dispute in this case as to the underlying offense. When Connolly wrote the fraudulent letter to Judge Wolf, and when he instructed Flemmi on how to lie on the witness stand, the <i>Salemme</i> prosecution included charges of first-degree murder. Moreover, Weeks testified during the trial that Connolly's goal was to get the entire case against Flemmi \"tossed out,\" and substantial evidence adduced at trial supports that conclusion. Finally, even assuming that an inquiry into the underlying offense would be appropriate in this case, and assuming it was error for the district court not to undertake that inquiry <i>sua sponte,</i> any such error would be far from \"plain,\" i.e., \"clear, in the sense that it was obvious.\" <i>United States v. Geronimo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"782081\"><a href=\"/opinion/782081/united-states-v-manuel-geronimo/\"><span class=\"volume\">330</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></a></span>, 74-75 (1st Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, the fact that Connolly, who was ably represented by counsel below, only belatedly turns to this argument, and cites only two cases from other jurisdictions, belies any claim that the error was truly \"obvious.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since Connolly has failed to demonstrate that the district court committed any error &#8212; plain or otherwise &#8212; when it determined that first-degree murder was the \"underlying offense\" for purposes of U.S.S.G. &#167; 2J1.2(c) and &#167; 2X3.1, we affirm the sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the first day of trial, when the jury first entered into the courtroom, the district court judge noticed that one of the jurors was carrying a notebook.

Arguing that the jury may have relied on \"extraneous prejudicial information\" during deliberations, Connolly filed a motion for an evidentiary inquiry into whether jurors had, in fact, taken notes during trial and whether they had considered any such notes during their deliberations.

We agree with the district court that this note-taking, assuming it actually happened, was not inconsistent with the court's instructions. The judge told the jurors that he wanted them to focus on the testimony, not in-court note-taking: \"I want you to just sit back and pay attention.\" Such a prescript did not foreclose the possibility of note-taking outside of court. Indeed, as the district judge noted, the jurors were provided with writing materials in the jury room from the outset of trial. Hence, the note-taking described in the <i>Globe</i> article did not constitute juror misconduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, assuming that any notes actually made their way into the jury room during deliberations,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> the notes cannot be considered an \"extraneous\" or \"extrinsic\" influence. In <i>Bassler,</i> the district court instructed the jury at the beginning of the trial that note-taking was not permitted. Like the two jurors in Connolly's trial, one of the <i>Bassler</i> jurors understood this instruction to mean that \"no notes should be taken during the actual trial time but could be taken during recess or other times outside actual trial time.\" <i>Id.</i> at 602. The juror therefore took notes at the end of each day, and these notes eventually found their way into the jury room during deliberations. The <i>Bassler</i> court held that the juror's daily notes could not be considered an improper \"extrinsic influence\" because they were, in fact, <i>intrinsic.</i> We agree, and \"[i]ntrinsic influences on a jury's verdict are not competent to impeach a verdict.\" <i>Id.</i> Hence Connolly cannot rely on the notes to demonstrate prejudice. <i>Cf.

Rather, he simply asks that we remand with instructions to the district court to \"do what has to be done to ferret out the truth.\" He does not identify any witnesses he would call at an evidentiary hearing, or what the substance of any testimony could possibly be. Indeed, Connolly has made no proffer of <i>any</i> evidence other than the <i>Boston Globe</i> article.

Since we agree with the district court's conclusion that its instructions to the jury did not preclude note-taking outside the courtroom, and since Connolly has failed to make any substantial evidentiary showing regarding prejudicial impropriety, the district court properly exercised its discretion in denying Connolly's motion for further inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of conviction entered on the jury's verdict and the sentence of the district court are <i>AFFIRMED.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>SO ORDERED.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Connolly does not appeal his convictions for obstruction of justice and making a false statement</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The indictment also named Bulger as a defendant on one count.

Act 1 alleged that Connolly took a bribe from Bulger and Flemmi. Acts 2 through 5 alleged that Connolly paid bribes to Morris on behalf of Bulger and Flemmi. Act 6 pertained to Connolly's involvement in the extortion of Rakes. Acts 7 through 9 concerned Connolly's sharing of confidential law enforcement information that led to the killings of Castucci, Callahan, and Halloran. Act 10 alleged that Connolly, working with Morris, had informed Bulger and Flemmi of a court-authorized wiretap and an ongoing grand jury investigation into illegal gambling activity. Racketeering Acts 11 through 14 allegedly took place during the period 1994 to 1998, after Connolly had retired from the FBI. All four involved obstruction of justice surrounding the<i>United States v. Salemme</i> case and are discussed in more detail in Part II.B below.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Several of the Acts were broken down into subparts, each one having the same factual basis. For example, the indictment divided the sixth Racketeering Act into Act 6A and 6B, \"either one of which alone constitutes Racketeering Act 6.\" As described on the verdict sheet, Act 6A accused Connolly of \"aiding and abetting the extortion of Julie and Stephen Rakes,\" while 6B accused him of \"aiding and abetting a conspiracy to extort Julie and Stephen Rakes.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> In evaluating Connolly's argument regarding the \"pattern of racketeering activity\" element, we do not rely on the \"unproven\" Racketeering Acts (1 through 3 and 5 through 10) described in note 4, supra. The Third Circuit, however, has indicated that a reviewing court need not be constrained by the jury's findings regarding the individual racketeering acts in determining whether the evidence, taken as a whole, supports an ultimate finding of guilt through a \"pattern of racketeering activity.\"<i>See Vastola,</i> 899 F.2d at 222-23. Since the \"proven\" racketeering acts (11 through 15) establish the requisite pattern, we need not consider whether other evidence adduced at trial supports such a finding.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The Second Circuit has noted that courts have been quicker to find RICO violations \"in cases where the acts of the defendant or the enterprise were inherently unlawful, such as murder or obstruction of justice, and were in pursuit of inherently unlawful goals.\"<i>United States v. Aulicino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"686726\"><a href=\"/opinion/686726/united-states-v-robert-aulicino-jr-david-cleary-and-louis-ruggiero/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1102</span></a></span>, 1111 (2d Cir.1995). We agree with the common-sense conclusion that in such situations, there is a greater threat of future criminal conduct. Of course, as explained in the text, there is no hard and fast rule, and the fact that there may be \"inherently unlawful\" conduct underlying the RICO charge would not prevent us from concluding that there was nevertheless no pattern of racketeering activity. <i>See, e.g., Miranda v. Ponce Fed. Bank,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"571255\"><a href=\"/opinion/571255/clarissa-miranda-aka-clarissa-miranda-rodriguez-v-ponce-federal-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">948</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 45-46 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Connolly unsuccessfully renewed this claim in his successive applications for release pending appeal. The district court, denying the request for release, concluded that \"no prejudice to the Defendant resulted from the jurors' considering notes they may have taken at night.\" In our order denying the same, we noted the article's ambiguity with respect to whether the alleged notes actually made their way into the jury room, and, citing<i>United States v. Bassler,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"391270\"><a href=\"/opinion/391270/united-states-v-albert-rolland-bassler-united-states-of-america-v-george/\"><span class=\"volume\">651</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">600</span></a></span>, 601-02 (8th Cir.1981), we indicated that \"[e]ven assuming that the jurors consulted these notes during deliberations, it is far from clear that prejudice should be presumed in the absence of a cautionary instruction [regarding the proper use of notes during deliberations].\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> We have previously noted the<i>Globe</i> article's ambiguity on this point. <i>See supra</i> note 7.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
