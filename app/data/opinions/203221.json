John A. Woodcock, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                      Lynch, Lipez and Howard,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     David Shaughnessy on brief for appellant.\n     Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, and Paula D. Silsby,\nUnited States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                             April 2, 2008\n\f          Per Curiam.      This sentencing appeal raises a single\n\nissue--whether the district court plainly erred in concluding that,\n\nin   committing   bank    fraud,       defendant   \"used    a[]     means    of\n\nidentification unlawfully to produce or obtain any other means of\n\nidentification\" within the meaning of USSG § 2B1.1(b)(10)(C)(i),\n\nand therefore increasing his offense level and resulting guidelines\n\nsentencing range.1    As defendant acknowledges, because he did not\n\nraise this issue below, our review is for plain error only.2\n\nFinding none, we affirm.\n\n          Defendant      makes     a    three-pronged      attack    on     the\n\nenhancement.   Only the first prong is developed in any depth in\n\ndefendant's opening brief.       Assuming that the second two prongs\n\nnevertheless warrant appellate review, but see United States v.\n\nZannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (holding that undeveloped\n\narguments are waived), they do not rise to the level of plain\n\nerror.\n\n          Defendant's first argument is that he used the name of a\n\nfictitious person to cash one of the counterfeit checks that was\n\n\n     1\n      With the challenged enhancement, defendant's guidelines\nsentencing range was 24 to 30 months, and the court sentenced\ndefendant to the bottom of that range. Without the enhancement,\nthe range would be 9 to 15 months.\n     2\n      The government argues that defendant not merely forfeited\nthis argument but affirmatively waived it by not objecting to the\nenhancement at sentencing and assuming that it applied in arguing\nfor a below-guidelines sentence. Such conduct, however, amounts to\na forfeiture, not a waiver. See United States v. Rivera, 448 F.3d\n82, 86 n.1 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n                                       -2-\n\fthe subject of the indictment.3     It is true that the phrase \"means\n\nof identification\" as used in section 2B1.1(b)(10)(C)(i) includes\n\nonly means of identification of \"an actual (i.e., not fictitious)\n\nindividual.\" USSG § 2B1.1., comment. (n.9(A)). However, the means\n\nused here included not only the fictitious name of one of the\n\npayees, but also the account number4 of Toys R Us and the payor\n\nname of Atlantic Coast Contractors, both actual entities.5       The\n\nfact that the name of a fictitious person was also used on one of\n\nthe checks is immaterial since the applicable definition of \"means\n\nof identification\" includes \"any name or number that may be used,\n\nalone or in conjunction with any other information.\"     18 U.S.C. §\n\n1028(d)(7) (emphasis added).      Similarly, the fact that defendant\n\n\n\n     3\n      The indictment, to which defendant pled guilty, charged him\nwith obtaining money in the custody of a federally insured bank,\nthe Bank of New York, by means of false and fraudulent pretenses,\nand aiding and abetting his wife to do so, all in violation of 18\nU.S.C. § 1344.    Those pretenses, which defendant admitted to,\ninvolved creating and using counterfeit checks bearing the account\nnumber of Toys R Us and the payor name of Atlantic Coast\nConstruction.\n     4\n      Bank account numbers are clearly \"means of identification.\"\nSee USSG § 2B1.1, comment. (n.9(A)) (incorporating the definition\ncontained in § 1028(d)(7)); 18 U.S.C. § 1028(d)(7)(C) (defining\nmeans of identification to include \"any . . . unique electronic\nidentification number . . . or routing code\"); see also United\nStates v. Scott, 448 F.3d 1040, 1045 (8th Cir. 2006).\n     5\n      In his reply brief, defendant argues, for the first time,\nthat those entities were not \"individuals\" within the meaning of\napplication note 9(A) or 18 U.S.C. § 1028(d)(7). We therefore do\nnot consider that question here. See United States v. Eirby, 515\nF.3d 31,37 n.4 (1st Cir. 2008) (deeming arguments raised for the\nfirst time in appellant's reply brief to be waived).\n\n                                  -3-\n\falso used a fake driver's license purporting to identify him as\n\nSteven Chapman, is equally immaterial.   In fact, at the change of\n\nplea hearing, the prosecution expressly disavowed any reliance on\n\ndefendant's production or use of that license.\n\n          Defendant's second argument focuses on the requirement\n\nthat the means of identification used must be of persons \"other\n\nthan the defendant\" himself.   USSG § 2B1.1, comment. (n.9(A)).   As\n\nalready indicated, the means of identification used here were of\n\ntwo entities--Toys R Us and Atlantic Coast Contractors--other than\n\nthe defendant himself.   So that argument clearly fails.\n\n          Defendant's third argument--if preserved and further\n\ndeveloped--might have presented a closer question. That argument--\n\nin enhanced form--appears to be that section 2B1.1(b)(10)(C)(i)\n\nrequires that two means of identification be used, one to create\n\nthe other, and that, here, the second means is absent.     In other\n\nwords, even if defendant used \"means of identification\" to produce\n\nthe counterfeit checks, those checks were not \"another means of\n\nidentification,\" like a credit card, a driver's license, or a bank\n\nloan, the examples used in the background note to section 2B1.1.\n\n          What constitutes \"another means of identification\" for\n\nthis purpose is far from clear under the guidelines themselves or\n\nexisting caselaw.   This court has never considered the question.\n\nIn a case factually similar to this one, one circuit concluded that\n\nthe enhancement applied to using other names and account numbers to\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fproduce counterfeit checks.           Scott, 448 F.2d at 1045.           Other\n\njurists have reached differing conclusions while agreeing that the\n\n\"convoluted language\" of the guideline and commentary is difficult\n\nto parse.        See United States v. Melendrez, 389 F.3d 829, 831-37\n\n(9th Cir. 2004); id. (dissenting opinion) at 837-40; see also\n\nUnited States v. Newsome, 439 F.3d 181, 187 n.7 (3d Cir. 2006)\n\n(declining to follow Melendrez).           Given that state of the law, we\n\ncannot say that any error in applying that enhancement here was\n\nsufficiently \"plain\" to warrant correction in the absence of\n\npreservation.       United States v. Goodhue, 486 F.3d 52, 58 (1st Cir.\n\n2007).      As    we   have   previously   explained,   \"[t]he   plain   error\n\ndoctrine is premised on the assumption that parties must take\n\nresponsibility for protecting their legal rights and, accordingly,\n\nthat only the clearest and most serious of forfeited errors should\n\nbe corrected on appellate review.\"          United States v. Padilla, 415\n\nF.3d 211, 223-24 (1st Cir. 2005) (en banc).              The errors alleged\n\nhere are not of that clarity or caliber.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f",
