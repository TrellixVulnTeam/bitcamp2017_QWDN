  <summary>7/31/2014--Introduced.
Air and Health Quality Empowerment Zone Designation Act of 2013 - Allows the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to designate an area as an air and health quality empowerment zone if the air pollution control district or other local governmental entity (area entity) authorized to regulate air quality for the area nominates the area for the designation and the area meets the following criteria:

 it has been designated as being in extreme nonattainment of the national ambient air quality standard for ozone and in nonattainment of the national ambient air quality standard for PM2.5 (particulate matter diameter); it had nitrogen oxide emissions from farm equipment, emissions of volatile organic compounds from farming, or nitrogen oxide emissions from sources governed primarily through international law in excess of specified amounts; it meets or exceeds the national average per capita incidence of asthma; it experiences unemployment rates higher than the national average; and the area entity will provide matching contributions of federal funds toward the activities to be carried out under the area's strategic plan to address air quality challenges, achieve attainment of air quality standards, and improve the health of the population in the area. Makes the effective period of area designation the shorter of 10 years or the period ending with revocation by the EPA.

Authorizes grants for carrying out an area's strategic plan.</summary>
