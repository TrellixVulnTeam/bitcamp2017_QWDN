  <summary>1/2/2015--Reported to House amended, Part I.
Kelsey Smith Act - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require a provider of a commercial mobile service or an IP-enabled voice service to furnish call location information concerning the telecommunications device of a user of such service at the request of an investigative or law enforcement officer.

Requires such a request to be accompanied by a sworn written statement from such officer stating facts that support that officer's probable cause to believe that disclosure without delay is required: (1) by an emergency involving risk of death or serious physical injury, or (2) in order to respond to the user's call for emergency services. Requires the law enforcement agency of such officer, within 48 hours after the officer makes such a request, to request a court order stating whether such officer had probable cause to believe that such conditions existed at the time of the request.

Shields a telecommunications carrier from any cause of action in any court or any civil or administrative proceeding commenced by a governmental entity for providing call location information in good faith in accordance with this Act.</summary>
