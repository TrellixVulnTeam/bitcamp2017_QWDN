Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to reauthorize the public safety and community policing (COPS ON THE BEAT) grant program for FY2015-FY2019.

Replaces various requirements for the allocation of grant funds with a requirement that a specified amount of funds available in any fiscal year be allocated to establish school-based partnerships between local law enforcement agencies and local school systems by using school resource officers who operate in and around elementary and secondary schools to combat school-related crime and disorder problems, gangs, and drug activities.</summary>
