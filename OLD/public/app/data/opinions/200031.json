Carmen Consuelo Cerezo, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                Selya and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Francisco Batista Dominicci on brief pro se.\n     Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Jorge E. Vega-Pacheco,\nAssistant United States Attorney, and Nelson Perez-Sosa, Assistant\nUnited States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          July 12, 2002\n\f            Per Curiam.          Francisco Batista-Dominicci appeals\n\nfrom the district court's sua sponte dismissal, pursuant to 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1915A, of his civil rights action, brought under the\n\nauthority of Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal\n\nBureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 395-97 (1971), against his\n\nformer    defense     counsel,    Julio   Gil-de-la-Madrid,         and   the\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney (\"AUSA\") who prosecuted him, Jacabed\n\nRodriguez-Coss.       He claimed that his attorney and the AUSA\n\nconspired against him and coerced him into signing a plea\n\nbargain agreement that the district court later allowed to be\nwithdrawn. Additionally, Batista asserted many claims of legal\n\nmalpractice against his attorney, alleging counsel failed to\nkeep confidential information secret and engaged in conflicting\nrepresentation of a codefendant.\n\n            The district court concluded that AUSA Rodriguez was\nabsolutely immune for actions taken in her role as a prosecutor\nand that Gil-de-la-Madrid was a private actor.               Consequently,\n\nthe court dismissed the complaint.           We affirm the dismissal,\n\nfor essentially the reasons stated in the district court's\nopinion.    We add that Batista's allegations that a conspiracy\n\nexisted    between    AUSA   Rodriguez    and     Gil-de-la-Madrid        were\nconclusory,     and   thus   insufficient    to    convert    the    private\nactions    of   Gil-de-la-Madrid      into   federal    action      for    the\n\npurposes of this suit, or to overcome AUSA Rodriguez's claim to\nabsolute immunity.       (We have observed, in dicta, that proper\n\nallegations of conspiracy could overcome an absolute immunity\n\n                                     2\n\fclaim of a prosecutor.    See Malachowski v. City of Keene, 787\n\nF.2d 704, 711 (1st Cir. 1986)).\n\n            Batista argues, for the first time in his reply brief\nand without legal support, that a prosecutor is not entitled to\n\nabsolute immunity when a criminal defendant's Fifth and Sixth\n\nAmendment rights are violated.      We generally do not consider\narguments raised for the first time in a reply brief, see\n\nUnited States v. Lemmerer, 277 F.3d 579, 592 (1st Cir. 2002),\nand in any event, find no support in our case law for such a\n\nproposition.\n\n            The district court’s dismissal of the complaint is\n\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                3\n\f",
