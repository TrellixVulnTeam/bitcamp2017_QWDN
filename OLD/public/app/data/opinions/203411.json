The petitioner, Celony Michel, is a Haitian\n\nnational and a self-proclaimed member of a Haitian political group\n\nknown as the Democratic Convergence.          He seeks judicial review of\n\na final order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) denying his\n\npetition for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under\n\nthe United Nations Convention Against Torture (CAT).               Ceding\n\nappropriate deference to the BIA's decision, we deny the petition.\n\n          The facts are relatively straightforward.          On August 25,\n\n2001, the petitioner entered the United States using an altered\n\npassport and an assumed name.             Shortly after his arrival, the\n\nImmigration and Naturalization Service (INS) apprehended him.          The\n\nINS then charged him with being an alien subject to removal from\n\nthe   United     States.      See     8    U.S.C.   §§   1182(a)(6)(C)(i),\n\n1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I).       The petitioner conceded removability but\n\ncross-applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection\n\nunder the CAT.\n\n          At an ensuing hearing before an immigration judge (IJ),\n\nthe petitioner described three instances of mistreatment allegedly\n\noccurring in 1996, 1999, and 2001.         He argued that these incidents\n\nestablished past persecution on account of his political opinion\n\nand, therefore, triggered a presumption of future persecution\n\nshould he be repatriated.           See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1).       In\n\nelaboration, he explained that his association with the Convergence\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fparty had made him a target for supporters of Haiti's then-\n\nPresident Jean-Bertrand Aristide.\n\n           Of the three incidents, two involved unjustified arrests,\n\nincarceration    without   charges,   and    imprisonment   in   terrible\n\nconditions.     Following the first arrest in 1996, the petitioner\n\nleft his wife and children in Maissade to seek shelter with other\n\nfamily members in L'Hermit.     The second arrest occurred in 1999\n\nwhen he returned to Maissade for a visit.         The petitioner claims\n\nthat he was beaten but he did not seek medical attention.\n\n           The petitioner later moved from L'Hermit to Port-au-\n\nPrince.   In 2001, after he voted for a Convergence party candidate\n\nin an election, members of the opposition Lavalas party (a group\n\nbeholden to President Aristide) beat him. Following this incident,\n\nhe left Haiti for the United States.        According to the petitioner,\n\nLavalas adherents from time to time asked his wife, who remained in\n\nthe country, about his whereabouts — but nothing in the record\n\nindicates either that these inquiries were threatening or that\n\nviolence was imminent if he returned to Haiti.\n\n           The IJ found that the petitioner was credible and had\n\nestablished past persecution on account of his political viewpoint.\n\nThe IJ also found, however, that the petitioner could not sustain\n\nthe presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution — the\n\nshowing required for a grant of asylum — because Aristide was no\n\nlonger in power in Haiti and the circumstances had fundamentally\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fchanged.    See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1)(i)(A). Thus, no relief was\n\navailable to him.\n\n            After      considering      the    petitioner's    appeal,    the     BIA\n\naffirmed    these      findings   and    conclusions.         Consequently,       the\n\npetitioner could not satisfy the requisite burden of proof for\n\nasylum.     That meant that his claim for withholding of removal\n\nnecessarily failed.        See Attia v. Gonzales, 477 F.3d 21, 24 (1st\n\nCir. 2007); see also INS v. Stevic, 467 U.S. 407, 430 (1984)\n\n(explaining that the alien's burden for withholding of removal is\n\na \"clear probability of persecution\").              The BIA also affirmed the\n\nIJ's determination that the petitioner had not demonstrated that,\n\nmore likely than not, he would be tortured with the connivance or\n\nacquiescence of the Haitian government if he were repatriated.\n\nThat     ended   the    petitioner's      CAT     claim.      See   8    C.F.R.     §\n\n1208.16(c)(4).\n\n            In the alternative, the petitioner asked the BIA to\n\nremand the case for the consideration of new evidence.                    The BIA\n\ndenied the motion, finding that the proffered evidence did not\n\nmaterially augment any of the petitioner's arguments.                    A remand\n\nwas, therefore, pointless. See Raza v. Gonzales, 484 F.3d 125, 128\n\n(1st Cir. 2008); Matter of Coelho, 20 I. & N. Dec. 464, 471-73 (BIA\n\n1992).\n\n\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\f              Following the issuance of a removal order, the petitioner\n\nfiled    this    timely    petition     for    judicial    review.          We    have\n\njurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(1).\n\n              Our review is centered on the BIA's decision.                        See\n\nOrelien v. Gonzales, 467 F.3d 67, 70 (1st Cir. 2006).                    But where,\n\nas    here,   the   BIA   has   endorsed      and   elaborated    upon      the   IJ's\n\nfindings, we review in tandem the decisions of both the BIA and the\n\nIJ.    See Ouk v. Gonzales, 464 F.3d 108, 110 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n              Our standard of review is familiar.                 When assessing\n\nfindings of fact in immigration proceedings, we must respect those\n\nfindings as long as they are \"supported by reasonable, substantial,\n\nand probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\"                      INS\n\nv. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992); see Pan v. Gonzales,\n\n489 F.3d 80, 85 (1st Cir. 2007).                    This deferential approach\n\nrequires that a factual determination be upheld unless the record\n\ncompels a contrary determination. 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B); Elias-\n\nZacarias, 502 U.S. at 483-84; López de Hincapie v. Gonzales, 494\n\nF.3d 213, 218 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n              The IJ's decision must be clear but not necessarily\n\ncomprehensive.       He \"need not address each and every piece of\n\nevidence\" adduced by the petitioner; he must, however, \"at least\n\nmake    findings,    implicitly    if    not    explicitly,      on   all    grounds\n\nnecessary for decision.\"         Un v. Gonzales, 415 F.3d 205, 209 (1st\n\nCir. 2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\f           A special standard of review applies to abstract legal\n\nquestions.   We review answers to such questions de novo, but give\n\nsome   deference   to   the    agency's     reasonable    interpretation     of\n\nstatutes and regulations that fall within its purview.                 Pan, 489\n\nF.3d at 85; see also Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def.\n\nCouncil, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 843-44 (1984).\n\n           Against this backdrop, we turn to the petition for\n\njudicial review.    We begin by evaluating the petitioner's asylum\n\nclaims and the denial of the motion to remand.                 We then briefly\n\naddress his claim for withholding of removal.                 The CAT claim has\n\nnot been briefed in this court and, accordingly, we deem that claim\n\nabandoned.   See Rotinsulu v. Mukasey, 515 F.3d 68, 71 (1st Cir.\n\n2008).\n\n           In order to qualify for asylum, an alien must demonstrate\n\nthat he is a \"refugee\" as that term is used in federal law.                See 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(a); see also Makhoul\n\nv. Ashcroft, 387 F.3d 75, 79 (1st Cir. 2004).                    To carry this\n\nburden, the alien must prove that he is unable or unwilling to\n\nrepatriate   because    of    persecution    related     to    race,   religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\nopinion.   8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A); see Orelien, 467 F.3d at 70.\n\nAs part of this showing, the alien must forge a causal link between\n\nthe persecution (whether past or feared) and one of those five\n\nstatutorily protected grounds.            Id. § 1101(a)(42)(A); López de\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fHincapie, 494 F.3d at 217; Raza, 484 F.3d at 128-29.                     The requisite\n\nshowing may be made by traveling along one of two avenues: either\n\nby establishing past persecution and thus triggering a presumption\n\nof future persecution, or by independently demonstrating a well-\n\nfounded fear of future persecution. López de Hincapie, 494 F.3d at\n\n217.\n\n            In     the    case     at    hand,         the       petitioner's   primary\n\nremonstrance is that the BIA undervalued his evidence anent the\n\ncurrent conditions of political unrest and violence in his native\n\nland.    To support this argument, he emphasizes the three incidents\n\nof mistreatment that he endured while living in Haiti.                             These\n\nincidents, however, reflect only past persecution; the latest of\n\nthem occurred in 2001. While they suffice to trigger a presumption\n\nof    future   persecution,      see         8   C.F.R.      §    1208.13(b)(1),    that\n\npresumption is rebuttable — and the incidents themselves have very\n\nlittle bearing on current conditions in Haiti.\n\n            To be sure, when a finding of persecution on account of\n\none of the five statutorily protected grounds (here, political\n\nopinion) triggers a rebuttable presumption of future persecution,\n\nthe burden shifts to the government to prove that the petitioner\n\ncould now return safely to his homeland either because threatening\n\ncircumstances had abated or because he could safely relocate there.\n\nSee     Orelien,    467     F.3d        at       71;    see       also   8   C.F.R.    §\n\n\n\n\n                                             -7-\n\f1208.13(b)(1)(i)(A)-(B). The government must prove its rebuttal by\n\na preponderance of the evidence.         8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(ii).\n\n           The BIA determined that the government had successfully\n\nrebutted the presumption of future persecution because the evidence\n\nindicated a regime change: Aristide had been deposed in February of\n\n2004.   See U.S. Dep't of State, 2006 Country Reports on Human\n\nRights Practices - Haiti § 3.       That shift in power constituted a\n\nfundamental change in circumstances sufficient to vitiate any well-\n\nfounded fear of persecution in Haiti on account of the petitioner's\n\npro-Convergence leanings.      If supported by preponderant evidence,\n\nthat explanation was enough to satisfy the government's burden.\n\nSee, e.g., Jorgji v. Mukasey, 514 F.3d 53, 59 (1st Cir. 2008)\n\n(explaining that persecution could not reasonably be anticipated\n\nwhen \"the regime that fostered [the past persecution] has long\n\nsince been supplanted\"); Ang v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 50, 57 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (noting that a regime change \"effectively eliminates any\n\nargument that [petitioner] would be persecuted\"); see also Laurent\n\nv. Ashcroft, 359 F.3d 59, 64 (1st Cir. 2004) (holding that the\n\nBIA's   findings   must   be   honored    unless   the   evidence   \"points\n\nunerringly in the opposite direction\").\n\n           This is the crux of the matter.          The BIA accepted the\n\ngovernment's explanation and, to set aside that determination, the\n\npetitioner must show that the record evidence compels rejection of\n\nthat explanation. See Aguilar-Solis v. INS, 168 F.3d 565, 569 (1st\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fCir. 1999) (explaining that \"the administrative record, viewed in\n\nits entirety, must compel the conclusion that the alien is asylum-\n\neligible\").     We turn, then, to that question.\n\n            A   review    of   the   record   leaves   no   doubt    that   this\n\ndetermination     is     supported    by    substantial     and    preponderant\n\nevidence.       The historical predicate for the BIA's decision —\n\nPresident Aristide's ouster — cannot be gainsaid.                 When Aristide\n\nleft, his Lavalas supporters lost their influence in national\n\naffairs.    With the levers of power having been wrested from the\n\nhands of his antagonists, there is no realistic possibility that\n\nthe petitioner's pro-Convergence sympathies will place him in the\n\nHaitian government's cross-hairs. See Sok v. Mukasey, 526 F.3d 48,\n\n53 (1st Cir. 2008) (\"[P]ersecution always implies some connection\n\nto government action or inaction.\") (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).   So viewed, the record cannot be said to compel a finding\n\nthat the petitioner harbored an objectively reasonable fear that\n\nhis allegiance to the Democratic Convergence will be a source of\n\nfuture persecution.\n\n            The second avenue for conferring asylum requires an\n\nindependent showing, unaided by any presumption, of a well-founded\n\nfear of future persecution based on a statutorily protected ground.\n\nMakhoul, 387 F.3d at 79.         To show a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution, an alien must establish that his fear was both genuine\n\nand objectively reasonable.           Orelien, 467 F.3d at 71; Aguilar-\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fSolis, 168 F.3d at 572.       The objective component must be \"nestled\n\non a plausible factual predicate.\"          Orelien, 467 F.3d at 71.      This\n\nnecessitates a showing that \"a reasonable person in the asylum\n\napplicant's circumstances would fear persecution on account of a\n\nstatutorily protected ground.\"           Aguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d at 572.\n\n             Based on essentially the same reasoning elucidated above,\n\nthe BIA determined that the petitioner had not made the requisite\n\nshowing. In its view, the regime change eliminated any objectively\n\nreasonable    basis   for   the    petitioner's   avowed   fear    of    future\n\npersecution    on   account   of   his    political   views.      This   is   an\n\neminently supportable assessment of the record: there is simply no\n\nevidence of a pattern or practice of persecution of Convergence\n\nparty members following President Aristide's fall from power.                 See\n\n8   C.F.R.     §    1208.13(b)(2)(iii).         Without    evidence      of    a\n\nparticularized threat to the petitioner or other members of the\n\nDemocratic Convergence, we are not at liberty to reverse the BIA's\n\ndecision.1    See Segran v. Mukasey, 511 F.3d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir. 2007)\n\n(explaining that deference is due not only to findings of fact but\n\n\n     1\n      The petitioner makes no explicit appeal that we review the\nBIA's denial of his motion to remand, nor need we linger long over\nthe new evidence he proffered in connection with that motion. It\nis settled beyond peradventure that general conditions of violence\nin a country cannot alone support a claimed fear of persecution.\nSee López de Hincapie, 494 F.3d at 219-20; Mendoza Perez v. INS,\n902 F.2d 760, 761-62 (9th Cir. 1990); Matter of S-V-, 22 I. & N.\nDec. 1306, 1310 (BIA 2000). The new evidence that the petitioner\nproffered here was evidence of general conditions of violence.\nThus, the BIA's denial of the motion to remand was well within its\ndiscretion.\n\n                                     -10-\n\falso to determinations about whether particular facts support a\n\nclaim of persecution).\n\n          In an effort to blunt the force of the BIA's reasoning,\n\nthe petitioner argues that the BIA failed to apply the standard\n\nannounced in Matter of Mogharrabi, 19 I. & N. Dec. 439 (BIA 1987),\n\nin determining that he had not established a well-founded fear of\n\npersecution.    In Mogharrabi, the BIA recognized that \"an applicant\n\nfor asylum has established a well-founded fear if he shows that a\n\nreasonable person in his circumstances would fear persecution.\"\n\nId. at 445.    The petitioner's argument fails because the BIA, like\n\nthe IJ, presented President Aristide's ouster as the reason why no\n\nobjectively reasonable person would thereafter fear persecution on\n\naccount of pro-Convergence sentiments.      No more was exigible.2     See\n\nOrelien, 467 F.3d at 72.      On this basis, we find the argument that\n\nthe BIA did not abide by its Mogharrabi standard unconvincing.\n\n          Relatedly,    the   petitioner   calumnizes   the   BIA   for   a\n\nfailure adequately to assess his evidence of persecution.           Citing\n\nSotto v. INS 748 F.2d 832, 837 (3d Cir. 1984), he insists that the\n\nBIA's decision must be remanded due to a failure to refer to\n\nrelevant evidence.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      In this regard, we think it is instructive that, in\nMogharrabi, the petitioner's fear of persecution stemmed from his\n\"clearly expressed . . . political views\" and the fact that \"his\nopinions were extremely derogatory to the regime in power.\" 19 I.\n& N. Dec. at 448 (emphasis supplied).\n\n                                  -11-\n\f              This is a bogus argument.       The BIA's decision here must\n\nbe understood as adopting the IJ's findings. See Laurent, 359 F.3d\n\nat 64 n.3.     That the BIA did not itself rehearse each and every IJ\n\nfinding does not allow an inference of superficial review.3                 See,\n\ne.g., Raza, 484 F.3d at 128 (\"An agency is not required to dissect\n\nin   minute    detail    every   contention    that     a   complaining    party\n\nadvances.\").\n\n              Finally,   the     petitioner    argues       that   the   Haitian\n\ngovernment is unable or unwilling to control the Lavalas party and\n\nthat this inability justifies a grant of asylum.              This argument is\n\nlittle more than a rehash of the arguments previously rejected.\n\nThere is no hard evidence that the government is unable to control\n\nwhatever may remain of the Lavalas party.             In the last analysis,\n\nthen, the salient principle is that generalized conditions of\n\npolitical unrest cannot constitute a basis for a claim of political\n\nasylum.   See Romilus v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(holding evidence of generalized problems insufficient); Matter of\n\nS-V-, 22 I. & N. Dec. 1306, 1310 (BIA 2000) (same).\n\n              To sum up, we are not without some sympathy for the\n\npetitioner's position. Haiti remains a nation in which violence is\n\npart of the political climate.          But a general state of disarray\n\nwithin a country is not in itself enough of a foundation to support\n\n\n      3\n       In all events, this case is at a commendable remove from\nSotto, in which both the IJ and the BIA entirely ignored an\naffidavit without explaining why. See Sotto, 748 F.2d at 837.\n\n                                     -12-\n\fa claim for asylum.      We therefore uphold the BIA's denial of asylum\n\nhere.\n\n              That effectively ends the matter. Because the petitioner\n\ncannot    establish     eligibility   for    asylum,   he   cannot   establish\n\neligibility for withholding of removal.             After all, the showing\n\nthat is required for withholding of removal is parallel to, but\n\nmore demanding than, that required for a counterpart claim for\n\nasylum.       See Ang, 430 F.3d at 58 (explaining that withholding of\n\nremoval requires an alien to establish a clear probability of\n\npersecution, rather than a well-founded fear of persecution).              In\n\nview     of    our   holding   that   the    BIA   supportably   denied   the\n\npetitioner's asylum claim, his claim for withholding of removal\n\nbecomes a dead letter.         Orelien, 467 F.3d at 73.\n\n              We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nthe petition for judicial review must be denied.\n\n\n\nSo Ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\f",

The petitioner, Celony Michel, is a Haitian\n\nnational and a self-proclaimed member of a Haitian political group\n\nknown as the Democratic Convergence.          He seeks judicial review of\n\na final order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) denying his\n\npetition for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under\n\nthe United Nations Convention Against Torture (CAT).               Ceding\n\nappropriate deference to the BIA's decision, we deny the petition.\n\n          The facts are relatively straightforward.          On August 25,\n\n2001, the petitioner entered the United States using an altered\n\npassport and an assumed name.             Shortly after his arrival, the\n\nImmigration and Naturalization Service (INS) apprehended him.          The\n\nINS then charged him with being an alien subject to removal from\n\nthe   United     States.      See     8    U.S.C.   §§   1182(a)(6)(C)(i),\n\n1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I).       The petitioner conceded removability but\n\ncross-applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection\n\nunder the CAT.\n\n          At an ensuing hearing before an immigration judge (IJ),\n\nthe petitioner described three instances of mistreatment allegedly\n\noccurring in 1996, 1999, and 2001.         He argued that these incidents\n\nestablished past persecution on account of his political opinion\n\nand, therefore, triggered a presumption of future persecution\n\nshould he be repatriated.           See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1).       In\n\nelaboration, he explained that his association with the Convergence\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fparty had made him a target for supporters of Haiti's then-\n\nPresident Jean-Bertrand Aristide.\n\n           Of the three incidents, two involved unjustified arrests,\n\nincarceration    without   charges,   and    imprisonment   in   terrible\n\nconditions.     Following the first arrest in 1996, the petitioner\n\nleft his wife and children in Maissade to seek shelter with other\n\nfamily members in L'Hermit.     The second arrest occurred in 1999\n\nwhen he returned to Maissade for a visit.         The petitioner claims\n\nthat he was beaten but he did not seek medical attention.\n\n           The petitioner later moved from L'Hermit to Port-au-\n\nPrince.   In 2001, after he voted for a Convergence party candidate\n\nin an election, members of the opposition Lavalas party (a group\n\nbeholden to President Aristide) beat him. Following this incident,\n\nhe left Haiti for the United States.        According to the petitioner,\n\nLavalas adherents from time to time asked his wife, who remained in\n\nthe country, about his whereabouts — but nothing in the record\n\nindicates either that these inquiries were threatening or that\n\nviolence was imminent if he returned to Haiti.\n\n           The IJ found that the petitioner was credible and had\n\nestablished past persecution on account of his political viewpoint.\n\nThe IJ also found, however, that the petitioner could not sustain\n\nthe presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution — the\n\nshowing required for a grant of asylum — because Aristide was no\n\nlonger in power in Haiti and the circumstances had fundamentally\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fchanged.    See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1)(i)(A). Thus, no relief was\n\navailable to him.\n\n            After      considering      the    petitioner's    appeal,    the     BIA\n\naffirmed    these      findings   and    conclusions.         Consequently,       the\n\npetitioner could not satisfy the requisite burden of proof for\n\nasylum.     That meant that his claim for withholding of removal\n\nnecessarily failed.

The BIA also affirmed the\n\nIJ's determination that the petitioner had not demonstrated that,\n\nmore likely than not, he would be tortured with the connivance or\n\nacquiescence of the Haitian government if he were repatriated.\n\nThat     ended   the    petitioner's      CAT     claim.      See   8    C.F.R.     §\n\n1208.16(c)(4).\n\n            In the alternative, the petitioner asked the BIA to\n\nremand the case for the consideration of new evidence.                    The BIA\n\ndenied the motion, finding that the proffered evidence did not\n\nmaterially augment any of the petitioner's arguments.                    A remand\n\nwas, therefore, pointless.

The CAT claim has\n\nnot been briefed in this court and, accordingly, we deem that claim\n\nabandoned.   See Rotinsulu v.

See 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(a); see also Makhoul\n\nv.

To carry this\n\nburden, the alien must prove that he is unable or unwilling to\n\nrepatriate   because    of    persecution    related     to    race,   religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\nopinion.   8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A); see Orelien, 467 F.3d at 70.\n\nAs part of this showing, the alien must forge a causal link between\n\nthe persecution (whether past or feared) and one of those five\n\nstatutorily protected grounds.            Id. § 1101(a)(42)(A); López de\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fHincapie, 494 F.3d at 217; Raza, 484 F.3d at 128-29.                     The requisite\n\nshowing may be made by traveling along one of two avenues: either\n\nby establishing past persecution and thus triggering a presumption\n\nof future persecution, or by independently demonstrating a well-\n\nfounded fear of future persecution. López de Hincapie, 494 F.3d at\n\n217.\n\n            In     the    case     at    hand,         the       petitioner's   primary\n\nremonstrance is that the BIA undervalued his evidence anent the\n\ncurrent conditions of political unrest and violence in his native\n\nland.    To support this argument, he emphasizes the three incidents\n\nof mistreatment that he endured while living in Haiti.                             These\n\nincidents, however, reflect only past persecution; the latest of\n\nthem occurred in 2001. While they suffice to trigger a presumption\n\nof    future   persecution,      see         8   C.F.R.      §    1208.13(b)(1),    that\n\npresumption is rebuttable — and the incidents themselves have very\n\nlittle bearing on current conditions in Haiti.\n\n            To be sure, when a finding of persecution on account of\n\none of the five statutorily protected grounds (here, political\n\nopinion) triggers a rebuttable presumption of future persecution,\n\nthe burden shifts to the government to prove that the petitioner\n\ncould now return safely to his homeland either because threatening\n\ncircumstances had abated or because he could safely relocate there.\n\nSee     Orelien,    467     F.3d        at       71;    see       also   8   C.F.R.    §\n\n\n\n\n                                             -7-\n\f1208.13(b)(1)(i)(A)-(B). The government must prove its rebuttal by\n\na preponderance of the evidence.         8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(ii).\n\n           The BIA determined that the government had successfully\n\nrebutted the presumption of future persecution because the evidence\n\nindicated a regime change: Aristide had been deposed in February of\n\n2004.   See U.S. Dep't of State, 2006 Country Reports on Human\n\nRights Practices - Haiti § 3.       That shift in power constituted a\n\nfundamental change in circumstances sufficient to vitiate any well-\n\nfounded fear of persecution in Haiti on account of the petitioner's\n\npro-Convergence leanings.      If supported by preponderant evidence,\n\nthat explanation was enough to satisfy the government's burden.\n\nSee, e.g., Jorgji v.

The BIA accepted the\n\ngovernment's explanation and, to set aside that determination, the\n\npetitioner must show that the record evidence compels rejection of\n\nthat explanation.

The historical predicate for the BIA's decision —\n\nPresident Aristide's ouster — cannot be gainsaid.                 When Aristide\n\nleft, his Lavalas supporters lost their influence in national\n\naffairs.    With the levers of power having been wrested from the\n\nhands of his antagonists, there is no realistic possibility that\n\nthe petitioner's pro-Convergence sympathies will place him in the\n\nHaitian government's cross-hairs.

So viewed, the record cannot be said to compel a finding\n\nthat the petitioner harbored an objectively reasonable fear that\n\nhis allegiance to the Democratic Convergence will be a source of\n\nfuture persecution.\n\n            The second avenue for conferring asylum requires an\n\nindependent showing, unaided by any presumption, of a well-founded\n\nfear of future persecution based on a statutorily protected ground.\n\nMakhoul, 387 F.3d at 79.         To show a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution, an alien must establish that his fear was both genuine\n\nand objectively reasonable.

The objective component must be \"nestled\n\non a plausible factual predicate.\"          Orelien, 467 F.3d at 71.      This\n\nnecessitates a showing that \"a reasonable person in the asylum\n\napplicant's circumstances would fear persecution on account of a\n\nstatutorily protected ground.\"           Aguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d at 572.\n\n             Based on essentially the same reasoning elucidated above,\n\nthe BIA determined that the petitioner had not made the requisite\n\nshowing. In its view, the regime change eliminated any objectively\n\nreasonable    basis   for   the    petitioner's   avowed   fear    of    future\n\npersecution    on   account   of   his    political   views.      This   is   an\n\neminently supportable assessment of the record: there is simply no\n\nevidence of a pattern or practice of persecution of Convergence\n\nparty members following President Aristide's fall from power.                 See\n\n8   C.F.R.     §    1208.13(b)(2)(iii).         Without    evidence      of    a\n\nparticularized threat to the petitioner or other members of the\n\nDemocratic Convergence, we are not at liberty to reverse the BIA's\n\ndecision.1    See Segran v. Mukasey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1194474\"><a href=\"/opinion/1194474/segran-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 5-6 (1st Cir. 2007)\n\n(explaining that deference is due not only to findings of fact but\n\n\n     1\n      The petitioner makes no explicit appeal that we review the\nBIA's denial of his motion to remand, nor need we linger long over\nthe new evidence he proffered in connection with that motion. It\nis settled beyond peradventure that general conditions of violence\nin a country cannot alone support a claimed fear of persecution.\nSee López de Hincapie, 494 F.3d at 219-20; Mendoza Perez v.

The new evidence that the petitioner\nproffered here was evidence of general conditions of violence.\nThus, the BIA's denial of the motion to remand was well within its\ndiscretion.\n\n                                     -10-\n\falso to determinations about whether particular facts support a\n\nclaim of persecution).\n\n          In an effort to blunt the force of the BIA's reasoning,\n\nthe petitioner argues that the BIA failed to apply the standard\n\nannounced in Matter of Mogharrabi, 19 I. & N. Dec. 439 (BIA 1987),\n\nin determining that he had not established a well-founded fear of\n\npersecution.    In Mogharrabi, the BIA recognized that \"an applicant\n\nfor asylum has established a well-founded fear if he shows that a\n\nreasonable person in his circumstances would fear persecution.\"\n\nId. at 445.    The petitioner's argument fails because the BIA, like\n\nthe IJ, presented President Aristide's ouster as the reason why no\n\nobjectively reasonable person would thereafter fear persecution on\n\naccount of pro-Convergence sentiments.      No more was exigible.2     See\n\nOrelien, 467 F.3d at 72.      On this basis, we find the argument that\n\nthe BIA did not abide by its Mogharrabi standard unconvincing.\n\n          Relatedly,    the   petitioner   calumnizes   the   BIA   for   a\n\nfailure adequately to assess his evidence of persecution.           Citing\n\nSotto v. INS </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"444563\"><a href=\"/opinion/444563/rodolfo-n-sotto-v-united-states-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">748</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">832</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 837 (3d Cir. 1984), he insists that the\n\nBIA's decision must be remanded due to a failure to refer to\n\nrelevant evidence.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      In this regard, we think it is instructive that, in\nMogharrabi, the petitioner's fear of persecution stemmed from his\n\"clearly expressed . . . political views\" and the fact that \"his\nopinions were extremely derogatory to the regime in power.\" 19 I.\n& N. Dec. at 448 (emphasis supplied).\n\n                                  -11-\n\f              This is a bogus argument.       The BIA's decision here must\n\nbe understood as adopting the IJ's findings. See Laurent, 359 F.3d\n\nat 64 n.3.     That the BIA did not itself rehearse each and every IJ\n\nfinding does not allow an inference of superficial review.3                 See,\n\ne.g., Raza, 484 F.3d at 128 (\"An agency is not required to dissect\n\nin   minute    detail    every   contention    that     a   complaining    party\n\nadvances.\").\n\n              Finally,   the     petitioner    argues       that   the   Haitian\n\ngovernment is unable or unwilling to control the Lavalas party and\n\nthat this inability justifies a grant of asylum.              This argument is\n\nlittle more than a rehash of the arguments previously rejected.\n\nThere is no hard evidence that the government is unable to control\n\nwhatever may remain of the Lavalas party.             In the last analysis,\n\nthen, the salient principle is that generalized conditions of\n\npolitical unrest cannot constitute a basis for a claim of political\n\nasylum.   See Romilus v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201241\"><a href=\"/opinion/201241/romilus-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">385</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 8 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(holding evidence of generalized problems insufficient); Matter of\n\nS-V-, 22 I. & N. Dec. 1306, 1310 (BIA 2000) (same).\n\n              To sum up, we are not without some sympathy for the\n\npetitioner's position. Haiti remains a nation in which violence is\n\npart of the political climate.          But a general state of disarray\n\nwithin a country is not in itself enough of a foundation to support\n\n\n      3\n       In all events, this case is at a commendable remove from\nSotto, in which both the IJ and the BIA entirely ignored an\naffidavit without explaining why. See Sotto, 748 F.2d at 837.\n\n                                     -12-\n\fa claim for asylum.      We therefore uphold the BIA's denial of asylum\n\nhere.\n\n              That effectively ends the matter. Because the petitioner\n\ncannot    establish     eligibility   for    asylum,   he   cannot   establish\n\neligibility for withholding of removal.             After all, the showing\n\nthat is required for withholding of removal is parallel to, but\n\nmore demanding than, that required for a counterpart claim for\n\nasylum.       See Ang, 430 F.3d at 58 (explaining that withholding of\n\nremoval requires an alien to establish a clear probability of\n\npersecution, rather than a well-founded fear of persecution).              In\n\nview     of    our   holding   that   the    BIA   supportably   denied   the\n\npetitioner's asylum claim, his claim for withholding of removal\n\nbecomes a dead letter.         Orelien, 467 F.3d at 73.\n\n              We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nthe petition for judicial review must be denied.\n\n\n\nSo Ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\f</pre>",
