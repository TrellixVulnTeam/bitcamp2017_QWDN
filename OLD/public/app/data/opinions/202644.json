Daniel R. Domínguez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                     Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                   Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                     and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Antonio Cuevas-Delgado and Cuevas Kuinlam & Bermúdez, on brief\nfor appellants.\n     José Luis Novas-Debién, on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n                        February 23, 2007\n\f           TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge. Plaintiffs-appellants James J.\n\nMalot (\"Malot\"), his wife, Caroline J. Chantry (\"Chantry\"), and\n\ntheir conjugal partnership (collectively \"Plaintiffs\") brought this\n\nbreach of contract action against Dorado Beach Cottages Associates\n\nand others (collectively \"Defendants\") following a failed real\n\nestate deal.     The district court dismissed Plaintiffs' case for\n\ndisregard of the court's discovery and management orders and for\n\nfailure to prosecute.        Plaintiffs appeal the dismissal on the\n\ngrounds that dismissal with prejudice was too harsh a penalty under\n\nthe circumstances and that the district court abused its discretion\n\nin dismissing the complaint as to all plaintiffs when only one of\n\nthe plaintiffs failed to comply with a discovery order.                  After\n\ncareful consideration, we reverse the district court's dismissal of\n\nPlaintiffs' claims and remand for further proceedings.\n\n                   I. Background and Prior Proceedings\n\n           In 1994, Plaintiffs entered into an agreement with Dorado\n\nBeach   Cottages    Associates   to    participate    in    a    real   estate\n\ndevelopment project in the Municipality of Dorado in Puerto Rico.\n\nPlaintiffs later moved to California.         A dispute arose between the\n\nparties   and   Plaintiffs   filed    suit   for   breach   of    contract   on\n\nFebruary 26, 2003 in the District of Puerto Rico.1              On January 27,\n\n\n\n\n1\n    Defendants filed a counterclaim, which the district court\neventually dismissed without prejudice pursuant to Defendants'\nrequest.\n\n                                      -2-\n\f2004, the district court held an initial scheduling conference,2\n\nsetting a cut-off date of November 1, 2004 for all discovery\n\nproceedings and requiring that Plaintiffs be available to be\n\ndeposed in Puerto Rico, since they chose Puerto Rico as the forum.\n\nThe scheduling order also indicated that the court would \"not\n\nhesitate to impose sanctions should obstinacy be present.\"\n\n          On March 12, 2004, Plaintiffs requested an extension of\n\ntime until April 4 to answer interrogatories, which were originally\n\ndue on March 25.   They failed to meet the self-imposed deadline,\n\nfiling their answers on May 24.   During the following months and on\n\nits own initiative, the district court extended the cut-off date\n\nfor discovery twice, first to December 15, 2004, and then to\n\nJanuary 14, 2005, in an attempt to encourage settlement.\n\n          On September 21, 2004, after two failed attempts to\n\ndepose Plaintiffs, Defendants filed a motion to compel Plaintiffs\n\nto appear for their depositions, and also requested the imposition\n\nof sanctions of reasonable attorney fees.   In response, Plaintiffs\n\nexplained that they had not been available to attend the suggested\n\ndates of deposition due to the \"very tight schedule in their\n\npersonal lives,\" given that Chantry was a pediatrician, a resident\n\nteacher at the Medical Center of the University of California, and\n\nin charge of research at the university, and Malot was involved in\n\n\n2\n   This scheduling conference was held after the court imposed\nsanctions on the defendants for failing to appear at the originally\nscheduled conference.\n\n                                  -3-\n\fanother lawsuit in California.             Plaintiffs suggested deposition\n\ndates of the morning of October 20 for Chantry and all day\n\nOctober 21 for Malot.         On October 3, the district court set the\n\ndates for Plaintiffs' depositions for October 20, 21, 22, and if\n\nnecessary,    23.     The     district    court     denied      without    prejudice\n\nDefendants'     request      for   attorneys      fees    \"in    connection      with\n\nplaintiffs [sic] obstinate refusal to appear to the taking of their\n\ndepositions,\" but warned Plaintiffs that \"the Court will not\n\nhesitate to impose sanctions, as a consequence of failure to comply\n\nwith this order.\"\n\n            Chantry appeared for only two hours on October 20, but\n\noffered to continue the deposition on October 21 from Orlando,\n\nFlorida via videoconferencing at her own expense.                         Defendants\n\nrefused the offer, citing the district court's clear requirement,\n\nstated in both the initial scheduling conference and the October 3\n\norder, that Plaintiffs should be available for depositions in the\n\nforum that they themselves selected.              Instead, the parties agreed\n\nthat Chantry would return to Puerto Rico to conclude her deposition\n\non   November   23.       Malot    completed   his       deposition     during    the\n\nspecified dates.\n\n            During Malot's deposition on October 22 and by letter to\n\ndefense counsel dated November 9, Plaintiffs informed Defendants\n\nthat despite their previous agreement, Chantry was not available to\n\ncome   to   Puerto    Rico    on   November    23    because      the     university\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fhospital's policy required at least six weeks' notice to cancel\n\nscheduled appointments, and she had appointments scheduled for that\n\nday.    Plaintiffs again offered to continue the deposition by video\n\ninstead.     Defense counsel indicated at Malot's deposition that\n\n\"[a]s things stand\" the parties had an agreement to complete\n\nChantry's deposition in Puerto Rico on November 23, but that he\n\nwould consult with his client regarding Plaintiffs' offer and get\n\nback to Plaintiffs' counsel. Defendants never responded further to\n\nPlaintiffs' request, and Chantry did not appear in Puerto Rico on\n\nNovember 23.\n\n            On January 12, 2005, two days before the discovery\n\ndeadline, the district court granted Plaintiffs' request to extend\n\ndiscovery once again, this time to February 14.          The court warned\n\nthe parties that no further extensions would be granted and advised\n\nPlaintiffs' counsel that Chantry had to complete her deposition in\n\nPuerto Rico before this date.         Notwithstanding the warning, two\n\ndays before the deadline, Plaintiffs again requested an extension,\n\nwhich   would   have   been   the   fifth   extension   of   the    discovery\n\ndeadline.    The district court denied the request.          Chantry failed\n\nto appear to complete her deposition.\n\n            On March 1, 2005, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss\n\npursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(b)(2).3             On July 28,\n\n\n3\n   Plaintiffs' response was due on March 14, but on March 4,\nPlaintiffs requested an extension until April 4, which the district\ncourt \"reluctantly\" granted.\n\n                                     -5-\n\f2005, the district court dismissed Plaintiffs' case with prejudice\n\nfor failure to obey a discovery order4 and failure to prosecute.5\n\nThe court acknowledged that\n\n            \"[d]ismissal with prejudice is a harsh\n            sanction, . . . which should only be employed\n            when a Plaintiffs' [sic] misconduct has been\n            extreme, . . . and only after the district\n            court has determined that none of the lesser\n            sanctions available to it would truly be\n            appropriate.\" However, the Court explicitly\n            makes such a finding. Plaintiffs have failed\n            to prosecute their case and have persistently\n            failed to heed to Court's orders even after\n            receiving a forewarning as to sanctions.\n\n(alterations and emphasis in original) (quoting Estate of Solís-\n\nRivera v. United States, 993 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1993)).\n\n            On August 8, 2005, Plaintiffs moved for reconsideration,\n\nbut   the   district   court   denied   the   motion   and   reaffirmed   its\n\nprevious order dismissing Plaintiffs' case.            The district court\n\nentered judgment on November 15, 2005.          This appeal followed.\n\n                               II. Discussion\n\n            We review dismissals under both Rule 37(b)(2) and Rule\n\n41(b) for abuse of discretion.          Angulo-Alvarez v. Aponte de la\n\n\n4\n   Rule 37(b)(2) states in relevant part, \"If a party . . . fails\nto obey an order to provide or permit discovery, . . . the court in\nwhich the action is pending may make such orders in regard to the\nfailure as are just, and among others the following: . . . (C) An\norder . . . dismissing the action . . . .\"        Fed. R. Civ. P.\n37(b)(2).\n5\n   Rule 41(b)   provides, \"For failure of the plaintiff to prosecute\nor to comply    with these rules or any order of court, a defendant\nmay move for     dismissal of an action or of any claim against the\ndefendant.\"     Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b).\n\n                                    -6-\n\fTorre, 170 F.3d 246, 251 (1st Cir. 1999).     Claims that a court has\n\nabused its discretion in dismissing a case for failure to adhere to\n\ndiscovery orders or for failure to prosecute have \"not received a\n\nsympathetic ear from us.\"   Damiani v. R.I. Hosp., 704 F.2d 12, 17\n\n(1st Cir. 1983) (collecting cases).     Nevertheless, we must fairly\n\nbalance the court's venerable authority over case management with\n\nthe larger concerns of justice, including the strong presumption in\n\nfavor of deciding cases on the merits.     Torres-Vargas v. Pereira,\n\n431 F.3d 389, 392 (1st Cir. 2005); Batiz Chamorro v. Puerto Rican\n\nCars, Inc., 304 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n          The appropriateness of a particular sanction thus depends\n\non the circumstances of the case.     Torres-Vargas, 431 F.3d at 392.\n\nIn particular, as the district court noted, \"[d]ismissal with\n\nprejudice is a harsh sanction, which should be employed only when\n\na plaintiff's misconduct has been extreme and only after the\n\ndistrict court has determined that none of the lesser sanctions\n\navailable to it would truly be appropriate.\"        Estate of Solís-\n\nRivera, 993 F.2d at 2 (emphasis, citations, and internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).\n\n          In Benítez-García v. González-Vega, a recent case very\n\nsimilar to the one before us, we reiterated a non-exclusive list of\n\nsubstantive factors to consider when reviewing sanctions orders:\n\n\"the severity of the violation, the legitimacy of the party's\n\nexcuse, repetition of violations, the deliberateness vel non of the\n\n\n                                -7-\n\fmisconduct, mitigating excuses, prejudice to the other side and to\n\nthe operations of the court, and the adequacy of lesser sanctions.\"\n\n468 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2006) (quoting Robson v. Hallenbeck, 81\n\nF.3d 1, 2-3 (1st Cir. 1996)).        We also noted a procedural dimension\n\nto our review as well, which addresses concerns such as notice,\n\nopportunity to be heard, and the court's explanation for its choice\n\nof sanction.     Id. at 5-7; Robson, 81 F.3d at 3.\n\n           The     first   few   factors    lend    themselves      to    a    single\n\ndiscussion.      Without    a    doubt,    the   disregard   of     court      orders\n\nqualifies as extreme behavior, and we do not take such insolence\n\nlightly.   E.g., Torres-Vargas, 431 F.3d at 393.             At the same time,\n\nwe have explained that \"not . . . every breach of a scheduling\n\norder   warrants    dismissal.\"       Tower      Ventures,   Inc.    v.       City    of\n\nWestfield, 296 F.3d 43, 46 (1st Cir. 2002).             In fact, we recently\n\nnoted that we were unable to find a case in this circuit in which\n\nwe had upheld a dismissal with prejudice based on a single instance\n\nof noncompliance with a discovery order.            Benítez-García, 468 F.3d\n\nat 5.\n\n           At first glance, the circumstances of this case present\n\na closer call than we faced in Benítez-García, where we found \"no\n\npattern of the plaintiffs repeatedly flouting court orders.\"                         Id.\n\nHere, the plaintiffs have evinced a pattern of delay, which clearly\n\n-- and understandably -- antagonized the district court.                         They\n\nrepeatedly requested, and were granted, extensions and missed\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fcourt-   and    self-imposed   deadlines.          The    district    court   also\n\nobserved that Plaintiffs had \"obstinately\" failed to complete their\n\ndepositions.\n\n            In context, however, the delay was not as severe as the\n\ndistrict court implied.        Although the original cut-off date for\n\ndiscovery was November 1, the district court itself extended the\n\ndiscovery      deadline   to   January       14    to    encourage     settlement\n\nnegotiations.       In    order   to    complete         Chantry's    deposition,\n\nPlaintiffs first requested and were granted an extension of one\n\nmonth; their second request for an extension, which was denied,\n\ncontemplated a March 15 deadline.                 If the extension had been\n\ngranted, the total delay caused by Plaintiffs in relation to\n\ncompleting discovery would only have been two months.                  We tend to\n\nreserve dismissal with prejudice for delays measured in years, see\n\nCosme Nieves v. Deshler, 826 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1987) (collecting\n\ncases), while reversing dismissals for conduct resulting in delays\n\nof merely a few months. Pomales v. Celulares Telefónica, Inc., 342\n\nF.3d 44, 48 (1st Cir. 2003); see also Benítez-García, 468 F.3d at\n\n5.\n\n            More importantly, perhaps, Plaintiffs offered legitimate\n\nreasons for their failure to complete their depositions on the\n\ndates initially arranged by Defendants.             Chantry also advised both\n\nthe court and Defendants that she would have only one morning\n\nduring the scheduled deposition dates in October.                    Although she\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fagreed to a date in November to complete the deposition, she\n\npromptly informed Defendants of her inability to do so to.\n\n            Furthermore, Chantry attempted on multiple occasions to\n\ncomply with the discovery order in question by completing her\n\ndeposition via teleconference.          The district court's insistence\n\nthat Plaintiffs complete their depositions in person in Puerto Rico\n\nseems somewhat inconsistent with the same court's haste to complete\n\ndiscovery.    While we express no opinion on the reasonableness of\n\nthe district court's requirement, we note that Plaintiffs made\n\nconcrete efforts to comply with the court's discovery orders and\n\nfind no evidence of deliberate misconduct.\n\n            The prejudice factor also weighs in Plaintiffs' favor.\n\nBoth sides contributed to the contentiousness and lethargic pace of\n\nthe discovery process.      As noted above, the defense was sanctioned\n\nfor failing to attend the first scheduling conference.          Defendants\n\nwere also uncooperative and unresponsive with regard to Plaintiffs'\n\nattempts to comply with the court's schedule.          The only prejudice\n\nto Defendants -- or to the court, for that matter -- is their loss\n\nof time, which we explained above was not proportionate to the\n\nsanction imposed.         No one has pointed to any reason why the\n\nrelatively short delay would affect Defendants' ability to litigate\n\nthe case.    See Benítez-García, 468 F.3d at 6.\n\n            The   final   substantive     factor   relevant   here   is   the\n\nadequacy of lesser sanctions, which in this case is inextricably\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\frelated to the procedural dimension of our review.                   Rule 37(b)\n\nprovides the district court with a veritable arsenal of sanctions,\n\nincluding   designating       certain   facts    as   established,     awarding\n\nattorney's fees, and holding the disobedient party in contempt.\n\nThe district court gave no explanation for its conclusion that any\n\nlesser sanction would be inappropriate, see Robson, 81 F.3d at 3\n\n(\"The presence or absence of an explanation by the district court\n\nmay also be a factor [in our review of sanctions].\"), and we find\n\nno support for this conclusion in the procedural record. The court\n\ndid not attempt to exhaust its milder options, nor did it first\n\nwarn Plaintiffs that they might face dismissal with prejudice. HMG\n\nProperty Investors, Inc. v. Parque Indus. Río Cañas, Inc., 847 F.2d\n\n908, 918 (1st Cir. 1988) (\"[T]he law is well established in this\n\ncircuit   that    where   a   noncompliant      litigant   has    manifested   a\n\ndisregard for orders of the court and been suitably forewarned of\n\nthe consequences of continued intransigence, a trial judge need not\n\nfirst exhaust milder sanctions before resorting to dismissal.\").\n\n            Although prior notice is not a prerequisite to dismissal\n\nwith prejudice, it is an important consideration.                See Robson, 81\n\nF.3d at 3 (\"[C]ounsel's disregard of a prior warning from the court\n\nexacerbates      the   offense,   and   the   lack    of   warning    sometimes\n\nmitigates it.\").       Here, the parties were forewarned in the initial\n\nscheduling order that their obstinacy could result in sanctions.\n\nThe district court again specifically warned Plaintiffs that it\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fwould not hesitate to impose sanctions for noncompliance with its\n\norder scheduling deposition dates.                  This latter warning, however,\n\noccurred in the context of denying attorney's fees to Defendants in\n\nrelation   to    their    motion       to    compel     Plaintiffs'    depositions.\n\nDespite these warnings, Plaintiffs could not have had realistic\n\nnotice   that    they    faced   the    harsh        sanction   of   dismissal    with\n\nprejudice.       As discussed above, they attempted to comply with\n\ncourt-ordered     deadlines      and    their        intransigence    had    otherwise\n\nminimal consequences to Defendants and the court.\n\n                                 III. Conclusion\n\n           While we do not condone the disregard of a court order in\n\nthis or any case, we must also act to protect the fairness of the\n\njudicial process.        In this case, we are compelled to conclude that\n\nthe   district    court    abused       its    discretion       in   dismissing    the\n\nPlaintiffs' case with prejudice.                   Accordingly, we need not reach\n\nPlaintiffs' second argument regarding the dismissal against all\n\nplaintiffs for one plaintiff's misconduct.\n\n           For the reasons stated above, we reverse the district\n\ncourt's dismissal and remand for further proceedings.                       We express\n\nno    opinion    regarding       otherwise           appropriate     sanctions     for\n\nPlaintiffs' violation of the court's prior discovery orders.                       We\n\nfurther note that Plaintiffs have now been suitably warned of the\n\nrange of sanctions available to the district court should they\n\n\n\n\n                                            -12-\n\fdisregard the court's authority to manage its schedule in the\n\nfuture.\n\n          Reversed.\n\n\n\n\n                            -13-\n\f",

Malot (\"Malot\"), his wife, Caroline J. Chantry (\"Chantry\"), and their conjugal partnership (collectively \"Plaintiffs\") brought this breach of contract action against Dorado Beach Cottages Associates and others (collectively \"Defendants\") following a failed real estate deal. The district court dismissed Plaintiffs' case for disregard of the court's discovery and management orders and for failure to prosecute. Plaintiffs appeal the dismissal on the grounds that dismissal with prejudice was too harsh a penalty under the circumstances and that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing the complaint as to all plaintiffs when only one of the plaintiffs failed to comply with a discovery order. After careful consideration, we reverse the district court's dismissal of Plaintiffs' claims and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background and Prior Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1994, Plaintiffs entered into an agreement with Dorado Beach Cottages Associates to participate in a real estate development project in the Municipality of Dorado in Puerto Rico. Plaintiffs later moved to California. A dispute arose between the parties and Plaintiffs filed suit for breach of contract on February 26, 2003 in the District of Puerto Rico.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> On January 27, 2004, the district court held an initial scheduling conference,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> setting a cut-off date of November 1, 2004 for all discovery proceedings and requiring that Plaintiffs be available to be deposed in Puerto Rico, since they chose Puerto Rico as the forum. The scheduling order also indicated that the court would \"not hesitate to impose sanctions should obstinacy be present.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 12, 2004, Plaintiffs requested an extension of time until April 4 to answer interrogatories, which were originally due on March 25. They failed to meet the self-imposed deadline, filing their answers on May 24. During the following months and on its own initiative, the district court extended the cut-off date for discovery twice, first to December 15, 2004, and then to January 14, 2005, in an attempt to encourage settlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 21, 2004, after two failed attempts to depose Plaintiffs, Defendants filed a motion to compel Plaintiffs to appear for their depositions, and also requested the imposition of sanctions of reasonable attorney fees. In response, Plaintiffs explained that they had not been available to attend the suggested dates of deposition due to the \"very tight schedule in their personal lives,\" given that Chantry was a pediatrician, a resident teacher at the Medical Center of the University of California, and in charge of research at the university, and Malot was involved in another lawsuit in California. Plaintiffs suggested deposition dates of the morning of October 20 for Chantry and all day October 21 for Malot. On October 3, the district court set the dates for Plaintiffs' depositions for October 20, 21, 22, and if necessary, 23. The district court denied without prejudice Defendants' request for attorneys fees \"in connection with plaintiffs [sic] obstinate refusal to appear to the taking of their depositions,\" but warned Plaintiffs that \"the Court will not hesitate to impose sanctions, as a consequence of failure to comply with this order.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chantry appeared for only two hours on October 20, but offered to continue the deposition on October 21 from Orlando, Florida via videoconferencing at her own expense. Defendants refused the offer, citing the district court's clear requirement, stated in both the initial scheduling conference and the October 3 order, that Plaintiffs should be available for depositions in the forum that they themselves selected. Instead, the parties agreed that Chantry would return to Puerto Rico to conclude her deposition on November 23. Malot completed his deposition during the specified dates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During Malot's deposition on October 22 and by letter to defense counsel dated November 9, Plaintiffs informed Defendants that despite their previous agreement, Chantry was not available to come to Puerto Rico on November 23 because the university hospital's policy required at least six weeks' notice to cancel scheduled appointments, and she had appointments scheduled for that day. Plaintiffs again offered to continue the deposition by video instead. Defense counsel indicated at Malot's deposition that \"[a]s things stand\" the parties had an agreement to complete Chantry's deposition in Puerto Rico on November 23, but that he would consult with his client regarding Plaintiffs' offer and get back to Plaintiffs' counsel. Defendants never responded further to Plaintiffs' request, and Chantry did not appear in Puerto Rico on November 23.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 12, 2005, two days before the discovery deadline, the district court granted Plaintiffs' request to extend discovery once again, this time to February 14. The court warned the parties that no further extensions would be granted and advised Plaintiffs' counsel that Chantry had to complete her deposition in Puerto Rico before this date. Notwithstanding the warning, two days before the deadline, Plaintiffs again requested an extension, which would have been the fifth extension of the discovery deadline. The district court denied the request. Chantry failed to appear to complete her deposition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 1, 2005, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(b)(2).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> On July 28, 2005, the district court dismissed Plaintiffs' case with prejudice for failure to obey a discovery order<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and failure to prosecute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The court acknowledged that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[d]ismissal with prejudice is a harsh sanction, . . . which should only be employed when a Plaintiffs' [sic] misconduct has been extreme, . . . and only after the district court has determined that none of the lesser sanctions available to it would truly be appropriate.\" However, the Court explicitly makes such a finding. Plaintiffs have failed to prosecute their case and have <i>persistently</i> failed to heed to Court's orders <i>even after receiving a forewarning as to sanctions.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(alterations and emphasis in original) (quoting <i>Estate of Sol&#237;s-Rivera v.

The district court entered judgment on November 15, 2005. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review dismissals under both Rule 37(b)(2) and Rule 41(b) for abuse of discretion. <i>Angulo-Alvarez v. Aponte de la Torre,</i> 170 F.3d 246, 251 (1st Cir.1999). Claims that a court has abused its discretion in dismissing a case for failure to adhere to discovery orders or for failure to prosecute have \"not received a sympathetic ear from us.\" <i>Damiani v. R.I. Hosp.,</i> 704 F.2d 12, 17 (1st Cir.1983) (collecting cases). Nevertheless, we must fairly balance the court's venerable authority over case management with the larger concerns of justice, including the strong presumption in favor of deciding cases on the merits. <i>Torres-Vargas v. Pereira,</i> 431 F.3d 389, 392 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Batiz Chamorro v. Puerto Rican Cars, Inc.,</i> 304 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appropriateness of a particular sanction thus depends on the circumstances of the case. <i>Torres-Vargas,</i> 431 F.3d at 392. In particular, as the district court noted, \"[d]ismissal with prejudice is a harsh sanction, which should be employed only when a plaintiff's misconduct has been extreme and only after the district court has determined that none of the lesser sanctions available to it would truly be appropriate.\" <i>Estate of Sol&#237;s-Rivera,</i> 993 F.2d at 2 (emphasis, citations, and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Ben&#237;tez-Garc&#237;a v. Gonz&#225;lez-Vega,</i> a recent case very similar to the one before us, we reiterated a non-exclusive list of substantive factors to consider when reviewing sanctions orders: \"the severity of the violation, the legitimacy of the party's excuse, repetition of violations, the deliberateness vel non of the misconduct, mitigating excuses, prejudice to the other side and to the operations of the court, and the adequacy of lesser sanctions.\" 468 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2006) (quoting <i>Robson v. Hallenbeck,</i> 81 F.3d 1, 2-3 (1st Cir.1996)). We also noted a procedural dimension to our review as well, which addresses concerns such as notice, opportunity to be heard, and the court's explanation for its choice of sanction. <i>Id.</i> at 5-7; <i>Robson,</i> 81 F.3d at 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first few factors lend themselves to a single discussion. Without a doubt, the disregard of court orders qualifies as extreme behavior, and we do not take such insolence lightly. <i>E.g., Torres-Vargas,</i> 431 F.3d at 393. At the same time, we have explained that \"not . . . every breach of a scheduling order warrants dismissal.\" <i>Tower Ventures, Inc. v. City of Westfield,</i> 296 F.3d 43, 46 (1st Cir.2002). In fact, we recently noted that we were unable to find a case in this circuit in which we had upheld a dismissal with prejudice based on a single instance of noncompliance with a discovery order. <i>Ben&#237;tez-Garc&#237;a,</i> 468 F.3d at 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At first glance, the circumstances of this case present a closer call than we faced in <i>Ben&#237;tez-Garc&#237;a,</i> where we found \"no pattern of the plaintiffs repeatedly flouting court orders.\" <i>Id.</i> Here, the plaintiffs have evinced a pattern of delay, which clearly &#8212; and understandably &#8212; antagonized the district court. They repeatedly requested, and were granted, extensions and missed court &#8212; and self-imposed deadlines. The district court also observed that Plaintiffs had \"obstinately\" failed to complete their depositions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In context, however, the delay was not as severe as the district court implied. Although the original cut-off date for discovery was November 1, the district court itself extended the discovery deadline to January 14 to encourage settlement negotiations. In order to complete Chantry's deposition, Plaintiffs first requested and were granted an extension of one month; their second request for an extension, which was denied, contemplated a March 15 deadline. If the extension had been granted, the total delay caused by Plaintiffs in relation to completing discovery would only have been two months. We tend to reserve dismissal with prejudice for delays measured in years, <i>see Cosme Nieves v. Deshler,</i> 826 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1987) (collecting cases), while reversing dismissals for conduct resulting in delays of merely a few months. <i>Pomales v. Celulares Telef&#243;nica, Inc.,</i> 342 F.3d 44, 48 (1st Cir.2003); <i>see also Ben&#237;tez-Garc&#237;a,</i> 468 F.3d at 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More importantly, perhaps, Plaintiffs offered legitimate reasons for their failure to complete their depositions on the dates initially arranged by Defendants. Chantry also advised both the court and Defendants that she would have only one morning during the scheduled deposition dates in October. Although she agreed to a date in November to complete the deposition, she promptly informed Defendants of her inability to do so to.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, Chantry attempted on multiple occasions to comply with the discovery order in question by completing her deposition via teleconference. The district court's insistence that Plaintiffs complete their depositions in person in Puerto Rico seems somewhat inconsistent with the same court's haste to complete discovery. While we express no opinion on the reasonableness of the district court's requirement, we note that Plaintiffs made concrete efforts to comply with the court's discovery orders and find no evidence of deliberate misconduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prejudice factor also weighs in Plaintiffs' favor. Both sides contributed to the contentiousness and lethargic pace of the discovery process. As noted above, the defense was sanctioned for failing to attend the first scheduling conference. Defendants were also uncooperative and unresponsive with regard to Plaintiffs' attempts to comply with the court's schedule. The only prejudice to Defendants &#8212; or to the court, for that matter &#8212; is their loss of time, which we explained above was not proportionate to the sanction imposed. No one has pointed to any reason why the relatively short delay would affect Defendants' ability to litigate the case. <i>See Ben&#237;tez-Garc&#237;a,</i> 468 F.3d at 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final substantive factor relevant here is the adequacy of lesser sanctions, which in this case is inextricably related to the procedural dimension of our review. Rule 37(b) provides the district court with a veritable arsenal of sanctions, including designating certain facts as established, awarding attorney's fees, and holding the disobedient party in contempt. The district court gave no explanation for its conclusion that any lesser sanction would be inappropriate, <i>see Robson,</i> 81 F.3d at 3 (\"The presence or absence of an explanation by the district court may also be a factor [in our review of sanctions].\"), and we find no support for this conclusion in the procedural record. The court did not attempt to exhaust its milder options, nor did it first warn Plaintiffs that they might face dismissal with prejudice. <i>HMG Property Investors, Inc. v. Parque Indus. R&#237;o Ca&#241;as, Inc.,</i> 847 F.2d 908, 918 (1st Cir.1988) (\"[T]he law is well established in this circuit that where a noncompliant litigant has manifested a disregard for orders of the court and been suitably forewarned of the consequences of continued intransigence, a trial judge need not first exhaust milder sanctions before resorting to dismissal.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although prior notice is not a prerequisite to dismissal with prejudice, it is an important consideration. <i>See Robson,</i> 81 F.3d at 3 (\"[C]ounsel's disregard of a prior warning from the court exacerbates the offense, and the lack of warning sometimes mitigates it.\"). Here, the parties were forewarned in the initial scheduling order that their obstinacy could result in sanctions. The district court again specifically warned Plaintiffs that it would not hesitate to impose sanctions for noncompliance with its order scheduling deposition dates. This latter warning, however, occurred in the context of denying attorney's fees to Defendants in relation to their motion to compel Plaintiffs' depositions. Despite these warnings, Plaintiffs could not have had realistic notice that they faced the harsh sanction of dismissal with prejudice. As discussed above, they attempted to comply with court-ordered deadlines and their intransigence had otherwise minimal consequences to Defendants and the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we do not condone the disregard of a court order in this or any case, we must also act to protect the fairness of the judicial process. In this case, we are compelled to conclude that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing the Plaintiffs' case with prejudice. Accordingly, we need not reach Plaintiffs' second argument regarding the dismissal against all plaintiffs for one plaintiff's misconduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, we reverse the district court's dismissal and remand for further proceedings. We express no opinion regarding otherwise appropriate sanctions for Plaintiffs' violation of the court's prior discovery orders. We further note that Plaintiffs have now been suitably warned of the range of sanctions available to the district court should they disregard the court's authority to manage its schedule in the future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Reversed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Defendants filed a counterclaim, which the district court eventually dismissed without prejudice pursuant to Defendants' request</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> This scheduling conference was held after the court imposed sanctions on the defendants for failing to appear at the originally scheduled conference</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Plaintiffs' response was due on March 14, but on March 4, Plaintiffs requested an extension until April 4, which the district court \"reluctantly\" granted</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Rule 37(b)(2) states in relevant part, \"If a party . . . fails to obey an order to provide or permit discovery, . . . the court in which the action is pending may make such orders in regard to the failure as are just, and among others the following: . . .

Claims that a court has abused its discretion in dismissing a case for failure to adhere to discovery orders or for failure to prosecute have \"not received a sympathetic ear from us.\" <i>Damiani v.

Nevertheless, we must fairly balance the court's venerable authority over case management with the larger concerns of justice, including the strong presumption in favor of deciding cases on the merits. <i>Torres-Vargas v. Pereira,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201971\"><a href=\"/opinion/201971/torres-vargas-v-pereira/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">389</span></a></span>, 392 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Batiz Chamorro v.

In particular, as the district court noted, \"[d]ismissal with prejudice is a harsh sanction, which should be employed only when a plaintiff's misconduct has been extreme and only after the district court has determined that none of the lesser sanctions available to it would truly be appropriate.\" <i>Estate of Sol&#237;s-Rivera,</i> 993 F.2d at 2 (emphasis, citations, and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Ben&#237;tez-Garc&#237;a v. Gonz&#225;lez-Vega,</i> a recent case very similar to the one before us, we reiterated a non-exclusive list of substantive factors to consider when reviewing sanctions orders: \"the severity of the violation, the legitimacy of the party's excuse, repetition of violations, the deliberateness vel non of the misconduct, mitigating excuses, prejudice to the other side and to the operations of the court, and the adequacy of lesser sanctions.\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 5 (1st Cir.2006) (quoting <i>Robson v. Hallenbeck,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196677\"><a href=\"/opinion/196677/robson-v-hallenbeck/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 2-3 (1st Cir.1996)). We also noted a procedural dimension to our review as well, which addresses concerns such as notice, opportunity to be heard, and the court's explanation for its choice of sanction. <i>Id.</i> at 5-7; <i>Robson,</i> 81 F.3d at 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first few factors lend themselves to a single discussion. Without a doubt, the disregard of court orders qualifies as extreme behavior, and we do not take such insolence lightly. <i>E.g., Torres-Vargas,</i> 431 F.3d at 393. At the same time, we have explained that \"not . . . every breach of a scheduling order warrants dismissal.\" <i>Tower Ventures, Inc. v. City of Westfield,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200043\"><a href=\"/opinion/200043/tower-ventures-inc-v-city-of-westfield/\"><span class=\"volume\">296</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, 46 (1st Cir.2002). In fact, we recently noted that we were unable to find a case in this circuit in which we had upheld a dismissal with prejudice based on a single instance of noncompliance with a discovery order. <i>Ben&#237;tez-Garc&#237;a,</i> 468 F.3d at 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At first glance, the circumstances of this case present a closer call than we faced in <i>Ben&#237;tez-Garc&#237;a,</i> where we found \"no pattern of the plaintiffs repeatedly flouting court orders.\" <i>Id.</i> Here, the plaintiffs have evinced a pattern of delay, which clearly &#8212; and understandably &#8212; antagonized the district court. They repeatedly requested, and were granted, extensions and missed court &#8212; and self-imposed deadlines. The district court also observed that Plaintiffs had \"obstinately\" failed to complete their depositions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In context, however, the delay was not as severe as the district court implied. Although the original cut-off date for discovery was November 1, the district court itself extended the discovery deadline to January 14 to encourage settlement negotiations. In order to complete Chantry's deposition, Plaintiffs first requested and were granted an extension of one month; their second request for an extension, which was denied, contemplated a March 15 deadline. If the extension had been granted, the total delay caused by Plaintiffs in relation to completing discovery would only have been two months. We tend to reserve dismissal with prejudice for delays measured in years, <i>see Cosme Nieves v. Deshler,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"492514\"><a href=\"/opinion/492514/angel-m-cosme-nieves-v-col-robert-c-deshler-co-fort-buchanan/\"><span class=\"volume\">826</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 2 (1st Cir. 1987) (collecting cases), while reversing dismissals for conduct resulting in delays of merely a few months. <i>Pomales v. Celulares Telef&#243;nica, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200617\"><a href=\"/opinion/200617/pomales-v-celulares/\"><span class=\"volume\">342</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></a></span>, 48 (1st Cir.2003); <i>see also Ben&#237;tez-Garc&#237;a,</i> 468 F.3d at 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More importantly, perhaps, Plaintiffs offered legitimate reasons for their failure to complete their depositions on the dates initially arranged by Defendants. Chantry also advised both the court and Defendants that she would have only one morning during the scheduled deposition dates in October. Although she agreed to a date in November to complete the deposition, she promptly informed Defendants of her inability to do so to.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, Chantry attempted on multiple occasions to comply with the discovery order in question by completing her deposition via teleconference. The district court's insistence that Plaintiffs complete their depositions in person in Puerto Rico seems somewhat inconsistent with the same court's haste to complete discovery. While we express no opinion on the reasonableness of the district court's requirement, we note that Plaintiffs made concrete efforts to comply with the court's discovery orders and find no evidence of deliberate misconduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prejudice factor also weighs in Plaintiffs' favor. Both sides contributed to the contentiousness and lethargic pace of the discovery process. As noted above, the defense was sanctioned for failing to attend the first scheduling conference. Defendants were also uncooperative and unresponsive with regard to Plaintiffs' attempts to comply with the court's schedule. The only prejudice to Defendants &#8212; or to the court, for that matter &#8212; is their loss of time, which we explained above was not proportionate to the sanction imposed. No one has pointed to any reason why the relatively short delay would affect Defendants' ability to litigate the case. <i>See Ben&#237;tez-Garc&#237;a,</i> 468 F.3d at 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final substantive factor relevant here is the adequacy of lesser sanctions, which in this case is inextricably related to the procedural dimension of our review. Rule 37(b) provides the district court with a veritable arsenal of sanctions, including designating certain facts as established, awarding attorney's fees, and holding the disobedient party in contempt. The district court gave no explanation for its conclusion that any lesser sanction would be inappropriate, <i>see Robson,</i> 81 F.3d at 3 (\"The presence or absence of an explanation by the district court may also be a factor [in our review of sanctions].\"), and we find no support for this conclusion in the procedural record. The court did not attempt to exhaust its milder options, nor did it first warn Plaintiffs that they might face dismissal with prejudice. <i>HMG Property Investors, Inc. v. Parque Indus. R&#237;o Ca&#241;as, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"506586\"><a href=\"/opinion/506586/hmg-property-investors-inc-v-parque-industrial-rio-canas-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">847</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">908</span></a></span>, 918 (1st Cir.1988) (\"[T]he law is well established in this circuit that where a noncompliant litigant has manifested a disregard for orders of the court and been suitably forewarned of the consequences of continued intransigence, a trial judge need not first exhaust milder sanctions before resorting to dismissal.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although prior notice is not a prerequisite to dismissal with prejudice, it is an important consideration. <i>See Robson,</i> 81 F.3d at 3 (\"[C]ounsel's disregard of a prior warning from the court exacerbates the offense, and the lack of warning sometimes mitigates it.\"). Here, the parties were forewarned in the initial scheduling order that their obstinacy could result in sanctions. The district court again specifically warned Plaintiffs that it would not hesitate to impose sanctions for noncompliance with its order scheduling deposition dates. This latter warning, however, occurred in the context of denying attorney's fees to Defendants in relation to their motion to compel Plaintiffs' depositions. Despite these warnings, Plaintiffs could not have had realistic notice that they faced the harsh sanction of dismissal with prejudice. As discussed above, they attempted to comply with court-ordered deadlines and their intransigence had otherwise minimal consequences to Defendants and the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we do not condone the disregard of a court order in this or any case, we must also act to protect the fairness of the judicial process. In this case, we are compelled to conclude that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing the Plaintiffs' case with prejudice. Accordingly, we need not reach Plaintiffs' second argument regarding the dismissal against all plaintiffs for one plaintiff's misconduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, we reverse the district court's dismissal and remand for further proceedings. We express no opinion regarding otherwise appropriate sanctions for Plaintiffs' violation of the court's prior discovery orders. We further note that Plaintiffs have now been suitably warned of the range of sanctions available to the district court should they disregard the court's authority to manage its schedule in the future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Reversed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Defendants filed a counterclaim, which the district court eventually dismissed without prejudice pursuant to Defendants' request</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> This scheduling conference was held after the court imposed sanctions on the defendants for failing to appear at the originally scheduled conference</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Plaintiffs' response was due on March 14, but on March 4, Plaintiffs requested an extension until April 4, which the district court \"reluctantly\" granted</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Rule 37(b)(2) states in relevant part, \"If a party . . . fails to obey an order to provide or permit discovery, . . . the court in which the action is pending may make such orders in regard to the failure as are just, and among others the following: . . .
