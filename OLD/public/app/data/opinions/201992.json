Plaintiffs/Appellants,\n\nAurelio Rosado, Lydia Rosado, and the conjugal partnership formed\n\nbetween     them,        filed      the         present      complaint        against\n\nDefendants/Appellees, Wackenhut Puerto Rico (“WPR”) and Wackenhut\n\nInternational,      Inc.     (“WII”)        (collectively          “the      Wackenhut\n\ndefendants”).        Plaintiffs        allege          violations     of     the    Age\n\nDiscrimination in Employment Act (“ADEA”), 29 U.S.C. §§ 621 et\n\nseq. (1994 & Supp. 2003); the Americans with Disabilities Act\n\n(“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131 et seq. (1994 & Supp. 2003); and\n\nvarious    Puerto   Rico    statutes.            The    district     court    granted\n\nDefendants’     Motion     for    Summary       Judgment     on     all    counts   of\n\nPlaintiffs’ Verified Complaint.            Plaintiffs appeal.1\n\n                                          I.\n\n                     Facts and Procedural History\n\n            The district court accurately summarized the facts as\n\nfollows.    WII is the parent company of WPR, a subsidiary company\n\ndedicated to providing security and surveillance services in the\n\nPuerto Rico private and public sectors.                 Mr. Rosado worked at WPR\n\nas general manager from January 31, 1989 until July 12, 2002,\n\nwhen he was terminated.          As general manager, Mr. Rosado possessed\n\nbroad responsibility and discretion for WPR’s operations, but his\n\n\n\n     1\n      In the interest of clarity, we discuss the case with exclusive\nreference to appellant Aurelio Rosado. However, this opinion is\nalso binding on appellant Lydia Rosado and the conjugal partnership\nformed between appellants Aurelio and Lydia Rosado.\n\n                                          -2-\n\factions were ultimately subject to WII corporate headquarters’\n\napproval.        Mr.    Rosado’s      responsibilities        included      submitting\n\nmonthly operations reports, balance sheets, and profit and loss\n\nsheets to the Vice-President of WPR Operations, Fernando Hegel,\n\nand the President of WII, William Morrow.                  Mr. Rosado was subject\n\nto periodic performance evaluations, and received yearly bonuses\n\nbased upon his performance and operational results.\n\n             During     the    first       several    years     of    Mr.     Rosado’s\n\nmanagerial guidance, WPR performed well.                   At its peak, WPR drew\n\n$33    million     in    revenues.           Mr.     Rosado    received       positive\n\nevaluations and was rewarded with favorable bonuses.                           Between\n\n1999   and   2001,      WPR   lost    a    significant     number    of     government\n\ncontracts, and revenue dropped by half.                While both parties admit\n\nthat there was recognition that WPR needed to lessen its reliance\n\non government contracts, which were ephemeral, and to instead\n\nredirect     sales      toward       the    private    sector,       the     Wackenhut\n\ndefendants and Mr. Rosado each claim that the other party was\n\nunresponsive in joining to remedy the problem.\n\n             After the conclusion of a fruitless dialogue between\n\nMr. Rosado and the Wackenhut defendants on righting WPR’s ship,\n\nin June 2001, Mr. Morrow and Mr. Hegel directed John Griffey, a\n\nWII Field Support Operations Special Project Manager, to visit\n\nWPR.    Mr. Griffey was directed to draft a sensitivity report\n\nassessing     WPR’s      operations        and   issuing      recommendations      for\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\fimprovement,      based   upon   his    visit   to   Puerto   Rico.   The\n\nsensitivity report highlighted the need for improved collections,\n\noperational efficiency, and increased sales.           In late January or\n\nearly February 2002, Mr. Morrow and Mr. Hegel met with Mr. Rosado\n\nin Puerto Rico to discuss how to improve WPR’s grim state of\n\naffairs.      Mr. Morrow strongly expressed his dissatisfaction with\n\nWPR’s performance and the need for drastic change, and directed\n\nMr. Rosado to submit a comprehensive action plan by the end of\n\nFebruary 2002.\n\n              Several days after the meeting took place, Mr. Rosado\n\nsuffered a cardiac arrest.2        Mr. Rosado was hospitalized and in\n\nrecovery for approximately fifty-five days before returning to\n\nwork.       Mr. Rosado was unable to work on the action plan during\n\nhis recovery.      Mr. Morrow and Mr. Hegel directed Mr. Griffey, who\n\nhad become familiar with WPR’s operations during his earlier\n\nvisit, to return to Puerto Rico, assist in the preparation of the\n\nWPR action plan, and provide leadership in Mr. Rosado’s absence.\n\n              Mr. Rosado returned to work in April 2002, but Mr.\n\nGriffey remained at WPR.         Mr. Rosado claims that WPR employees\n\nwere now answering exclusively to Mr. Griffey’s command and that\n\nalthough when questioned as to his formal role Mr. Griffey was\n\npurposefully ambiguous, Mr. Griffey had become WPR’s de-facto\n\n\n\n        2\n     This was Mr. Rosado’s second heart attack.           His first heart\nattack took place in April 1998.\n\n                                       -4-\n\fgeneral manager.         Mr. Rosado claims that while he retained his\n\nformal title as general manager, he had lost all authority at\n\nWPR.\n\n             Shortly after Mr. Rosado returned, Mr. Hegel requested\n\nthat he review Mr. Griffey’s action plan and either approve Mr.\n\nGriffey’s plan or, in the alternative, submit his own action\n\nplan.      Mr. Rosado reviewed and, with some reservations, adopted\n\nMr. Griffey’s action plan.\n\n             In   or    around   May    2002,    Miguel    Angel   Escobar,     the\n\nPresident of Wackenhut El Salvador (“WES”), placed a telephone\n\ncall to Mr. Rosado.3        During the conversation, Mr. Escobar asked\n\nMr. Rosado, “Why don’t you retire?”               Mr. Escobar suggested that\n\n“things would probably be easier for everyone” if Mr. Rosado\n\nretired.\n\n             Approximately       one   month    later,    Mr.   Morrow   made   the\n\ndecision to terminate Mr. Rosado.               On July 12, 2002, Mr. Hegel\n\ninformed Mr. Rosado that he was terminated.                     Upon Mr. Hegel’s\n\nrecommendations, Mr. Morrow appointed Mr. Griffey as the new\n\ngeneral manager for WPR.\n\n             Mr. Rosado filed the instant action alleging violations\n\nof the ADEA, the ADA and various Puerto Rico statutes.                          The\n\ndistrict     court     granted   the    Wackenhut    defendants’     Motion     for\n\n\n\n       3\n     Like WPR, WES is a subsidiary of WII.                 WES’s leadership has\nno authority over WPR.\n\n                                        -5-\n\fSummary     Judgment   on    all    counts     of   Mr.   Rosado’s      Verified\n\nComplaint.\n\n                                      II.\n\n                       Summary Judgment Standard\n\n            The standard for summary judgment is straightforward\n\nand   well-established.        A    district    court     may   enter   summary\n\njudgment upon a showing “that there is no genuine issue as to any\n\nmaterial fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment\n\nas a matter of law.”        Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). We review summary\n\njudgment rulings de novo, construing the record evidence in the\n\nlight most favorable to, and drawing all reasonable inferences in\n\nfavor of, the nonmoving party.               Straughn v. Delta Air Lines,\n\nInc., 250 F.3d 23, 33 (1st Cir. 2001); Feliciano de la Cruz v. El\n\nConquistador Resort & Country Club, 218 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.\n\n2000). Summary judgment is appropriate when “there is no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact.”         Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). “Even in\n\nemployment discrimination cases where elusive concepts such as\n\nmotive or intent are at issue,” summary judgment is appropriate\n\nif    the    non-moving     party    rests      “merely     upon     conclusory\n\nallegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation.”\n\nFeliciano, 218 F.3d at 5 (quoting Medina-Munoz v. R.J. Reynolds\n\nTobacco Co., 896 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir.1990))(internal quotations\n\nomitted).    It is within this procedural framework that we assess\n\nMr. Rosado's claims.        Our review is not constrained by the lower\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fcourt's stated rationale; we may affirm the entry of summary\n\njudgment   on     any   ground   supported        by   the     record.      See   Houlton\n\nCitizens' Coal. v. Town of Houlton, 175 F.3d at 178, 184 (1st\n\nCir. 1999).\n\n                                 The ADEA Claim\n\n            The ADEA makes it unlawful for an employer to discharge\n\nany individual or otherwise discriminate against him on the basis\n\nof his age.       See 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1).            Since there is no direct\n\nevidence   which     demonstrates      the       Wackenhut         defendants’    alleged\n\ndiscriminatory animus against Mr. Rosado, we must consider the\n\nmulti-part McDonnell Douglas test.                  McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.\n\nGreen, 411 U.S. 792, 802-805 (1973).                     Applying the McDonnell\n\nDouglas framework, Mr. Rosado must first                       “demonstrate that he\n\n(1) was at least forty years of age, (2) met the employer’s\n\nlegitimate job performance expectations, (3) experienced adverse\n\nemployment action; and (4) was replaced by a person with roughly\n\nequivalent job qualifications.”              Goldman v. First Nat’l Bank of\n\nBoston, 985 F.2d 1113, 1117 (1st Cir. 1993).                       The record supports\n\nthe conclusion that Mr. Rosado satisfies the prima facie case\n\nfactors.      The    burden   of     production        then    shifts      back   to   the\n\nemployer    who     must   rebut     the    inference         of    discrimination      by\n\narticulating some legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the\n\nadverse    employment      action.         Dominquez-Cruz           v.   Suttle   Caribe,\n\nInc., 202 F.3d 424, 430 (1st Cir. 2000).                  Mr. Rosado admits, and\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\fthis Court finds, that the Wackenhut defendants have satisfied\n\ntheir   burden      of   production    by    asserting     that   Mr.   Rosado   was\n\ndischarged     because     his    managerial    performance       since   1998    was\n\nunsatisfactory and because WPR was suffering a lack of effective\n\nleadership.\n\n              In the final stage of the analysis the burden shifts\n\nback    to    Mr.    Rosado      to   show    that   the    employer’s      alleged\n\njustification was not its true reason for the adverse employment\n\naction, but was a mere pretext for age discrimination.                           Id.;\n\nMesnick v. Gen. Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 823 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\nThe ADEA “does not stop a company from discharging an employee\n\nfor any reason (fair or unfair) or for no reason, so long as the\n\ndecision to fire does not stem from the person’s age.”                     Freeman\n\nv. Package Mach. Co., 865 F.2d 1331, 1341 (1st Cir. 1988).                       Mr.\n\nRosado must produce evidence beyond the mere assertion that the\n\nalleged justification is implausible and show that the employer’s\n\ndiscriminatory animus actually motivated the adverse employment\n\naction.      See Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 825.\n\n              The record is devoid of any sign that anyone in a\n\ndecision-making role, including Mr. Morrow and Mr. Hegel, bore\n\nany discriminatory animus toward Mr. Rosado.                 Appellant fails to\n\npresent evidence necessary to show that the Wackenhut defendants’\n\ngiven reasons for the termination were pretextual.                        Appellant\n\nmakes sweeping statements but fails to cite to any material fact\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fin controversy in the record.                 Although appellant states that\n\n“the district court has completely ignored most, if not all, of\n\nPlaintiff’s pretext evidence,” he never discloses what evidence\n\nthe    district      court    disregarded.          Appellant’s       Brief      at     21.\n\nGenerally, appellant criticizes the district court for missing\n\nimportant considerations such as “the significance of assessing\n\nthe whole picture, proximity in time, and the employer’s control\n\nof information.”        Appellant’s Brief at 22.               But, here again, he\n\nnever states what is that pertinent evidence.\n\n             Even if we were to consider appellant’s unsupported\n\narguments,     the     evidence      fails    to    create     a   trial-worthy         age\n\ndiscrimination        claim.         Appellant      states     that       according      to\n\nWackenhut     corporate        officers      Mr.    Rosado     was    aware      that     a\n\nsensitivity report was being prepared but Mr. Rosado denies that\n\nhe    knew   the    reasons    for    Mr.    Griffey’s    visit      to    the   island.\n\nAssuming that there is contradictory testimony on this point,\n\nsuch conflict does not support the inference that the reason\n\ngiven by the Wackenhut defendants for Mr. Rosado’s termination\n\nwas a pretext for age discrimination.                Appellant also attempts to\n\ndraw some inference of pretext from the February 2002 meeting\n\nbetween Mr. Morrow and Mr. Rosado wherein Morrow discussed the\n\nsensitivity        report’s    conclusions        with   Mr.   Rosado,      which     were\n\napparently unknown to Rosado until that time.                      However, the fact\n\nthat Mr. Rosado was kept out of the loop on the sensitivity\n\n\n                                            -9-\n\freport does not in any way suggest that the Wackenhut defendants’\n\nperformance-based reasons for terminating Mr. Rosado were false.\n\n            Finally, appellant suggests that when Mr. Morrow asked\n\nhim to create an action plan for WPR, Mr. Morrow was giving Mr.\n\nRosado     an    opportunity       to   improve       the      company’s          economic\n\nsituation.        Because he was terminated less than three months\n\nafter returning to work from the heart attack, appellant suggests\n\nthat there is sufficient evidence in the record for a trier of\n\nfact to conclude that the chance Mr. Morrow gave him was just a\n\nfalse gesture in a discriminatory cover-up scheme.                           However, the\n\ntiming of his termination, standing alone or even in conjunction\n\nwith being kept out of the loop on the sensitivity report, does\n\nnot   in    any     way    suggest      that    the       Wackenhut           defendants’\n\nperformance-based reasons for terminating Mr. Rosado were false.\n\nAppellant has not presented any evidence besides his age and Mr.\n\nGriffey’s       presence    pointing     to    age        as    a   factor        in    his\n\ntermination.           Moreover,    appellant       has     made       no     attempt   to\n\ndemonstrate       that    WPR’s    economic     losses         under        Mr.   Rosado’s\n\nleadership      were     fabricated     by    the    company        to       conceal    his\n\nsuperiors’ discriminatory motives.\n\n                                   The ADA Claim\n\n            To establish a claim of disability discrimination under\n\nthe ADA, a plaintiff must prove, by a preponderance of evidence,\n\nthat he (1) was disabled within the meaning of the ADA, (2) was\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fable   to    perform   the   essential   functions    of   the   job    with   or\n\nwithout reasonable accommodation, and (3) was discharged by the\n\nemployer in whole or in part because of his disability.                  Jacques\n\nv. Clean-Up Group, 96 F.3d 506, 511 (1st Cir. 1996).                   Appellant\n\ndoes not allege any direct evidence of disability discrimination.\n\nHere again, in the absence of direct evidence, Mr. Rosado may\n\n“indirectly” prove his case by “using the prima facie case and\n\nburden      shifting   methods    originated     in   McDonnell        Douglas.”\n\nJacques, 96 F.3d at 511 (quoting Katz v. City Metal Co., 87 F.3d\n\n26, 30 n.2 (1st Cir. 1996)).\n\n             Under McDonnell Douglas Mr. Rosado must demonstrate by\n\na preponderance of evidence that he (1) has a disability within\n\nthe meaning of the ADA, (2) is qualified to perform the essential\n\nfunctions of the job, with or without reasonable accommodations,\n\n(3) was subject to an adverse employment action by a company\n\nsubject to the ADA, (4) was replaced by a non-disabled person or\n\ntreated     less   favorably   than   non-disabled     employees,       and    (5)\n\nsuffered damages as a result.            Id.   The district court granted\n\ndefendants’ motion for summary judgment after finding that Mr.\n\nRosado failed to establish a prima facie case under the ADA.\n\n             Appellant correctly asserts that it is not necessary\n\nthat he actually be disabled, but that it is sufficient that his\n\nemployer regarded him as disabled.             Considering this theory of\n\nliability, the district court found that Mr. Rosado’s assertion\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fthat he “must have been generally perceived as impaired because\n\nof his shortness of breath” was not supported by the record.                On\n\nappeal Mr. Rosado again contends that the Wackenhut defendants\n\nterminated him because he was perceived as being “an old man who\n\nhad   suffered   a   second   heart    attack   which   prevented   him    from\n\nperforming the task required from a manager in the industry.”\n\nAppellant’s Brief at 34.            To support this statement, appellant\n\nstates that anyone observing him after he returned would have\n\nnoticed physical changes that would have led them to conclude\n\nthat he was disabled or could not do the job.            However, appellant\n\ndoes not cite to any evidence in the summary judgment record that\n\neven upon noticing his shortness of breath, anyone entertained\n\nthe belief that he was disabled.          Without providing evidence of a\n\nsingle instance of misperception by any particular person or\n\ngroup of persons, Mr. Rosado can not satisfy his prima facie\n\nburden under the ADA.\n\n             Although appellant suggests that after he returned to\n\nwork he was universally treated as if he was completely incapable\n\nof performing the duties of general manager, his only support for\n\nthis conclusion is that he was required to have Mr. Griffey\n\nauthorize his decisions before they became final.                 Mr. Rosado\n\nmakes   no   citation   to    the    evidentiary   record   to   support    the\n\nassertion that his decisions had to receive prior authorization\n\nfrom Mr. Griffey.       However, even if Mr. Griffey was exercising\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\foversight over Mr. Rosado’s decisionmaking at WPR, there is no\n\nevidence that this is related to a perception by the Wackenhut\n\ndefendants    that    Mr.    Rosado   is    disabled   rather     than    to   the\n\ntroubled financial condition of WPR and the corporate effort to\n\nimplement the action plan, which Mr. Griffey was instrumental in\n\ndeveloping.    Without record support for the inference that the\n\nalleged   oversight    was    in   some    way   connected   to   Mr.    Rosado’s\n\nshortness of breath, Mr. Rosado can not establish a prima facie\n\ncase under the ADA.\n\n           The district court’s judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\f",

(“WII”)        (collectively          “the      Wackenhut\n\ndefendants”).        Plaintiffs        allege          violations     of     the    Age\n\nDiscrimination in Employment Act (“ADEA”), 29 U.S.C. §§ 621 et\n\nseq.

The    district     court    granted\n\nDefendants’     Motion     for    Summary       Judgment     on     all    counts   of\n\nPlaintiffs’ Verified Complaint.

WII is the parent company of WPR, a subsidiary company\n\ndedicated to providing security and surveillance services in the\n\nPuerto Rico private and public sectors.                 Mr. Rosado worked at WPR\n\nas general manager from January 31, 1989 until July 12, 2002,\n\nwhen he was terminated.          As general manager, Mr. Rosado possessed\n\nbroad responsibility and discretion for WPR’s operations, but his\n\n\n\n     1\n      In the interest of clarity, we discuss the case with exclusive\nreference to appellant Aurelio Rosado. However, this opinion is\nalso binding on appellant Lydia Rosado and the conjugal partnership\nformed between appellants Aurelio and Lydia Rosado.\n\n                                          -2-\n\factions were ultimately subject to WII corporate headquarters’\n\napproval.        Mr.    Rosado’s      responsibilities        included      submitting\n\nmonthly operations reports, balance sheets, and profit and loss\n\nsheets to the Vice-President of WPR Operations, Fernando Hegel,\n\nand the President of WII, William Morrow.                  Mr. Rosado was subject\n\nto periodic performance evaluations, and received yearly bonuses\n\nbased upon his performance and operational results.\n\n             During     the    first       several    years     of    Mr.     Rosado’s\n\nmanagerial guidance, WPR performed well.                   At its peak, WPR drew\n\n$33    million     in    revenues.           Mr.     Rosado    received       positive\n\nevaluations and was rewarded with favorable bonuses.                           Between\n\n1999   and   2001,      WPR   lost    a    significant     number    of     government\n\ncontracts, and revenue dropped by half.                While both parties admit\n\nthat there was recognition that WPR needed to lessen its reliance\n\non government contracts, which were ephemeral, and to instead\n\nredirect     sales      toward       the    private    sector,       the     Wackenhut\n\ndefendants and Mr. Rosado each claim that the other party was\n\nunresponsive in joining to remedy the problem.\n\n             After the conclusion of a fruitless dialogue between\n\nMr. Rosado and the Wackenhut defendants on righting WPR’s ship,\n\nin June 2001, Mr. Morrow and Mr. Hegel directed John Griffey, a\n\nWII Field Support Operations Special Project Manager, to visit\n\nWPR.    Mr. Griffey was directed to draft a sensitivity report\n\nassessing     WPR’s      operations        and   issuing      recommendations      for\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\fimprovement,      based   upon   his    visit   to   Puerto   Rico.   The\n\nsensitivity report highlighted the need for improved collections,\n\noperational efficiency, and increased sales.           In late January or\n\nearly February 2002, Mr. Morrow and Mr. Hegel met with Mr. Rosado\n\nin Puerto Rico to discuss how to improve WPR’s grim state of\n\naffairs.      Mr. Morrow strongly expressed his dissatisfaction with\n\nWPR’s performance and the need for drastic change, and directed\n\nMr. Rosado to submit a comprehensive action plan by the end of\n\nFebruary 2002.\n\n              Several days after the meeting took place, Mr. Rosado\n\nsuffered a cardiac arrest.2        Mr. Rosado was hospitalized and in\n\nrecovery for approximately fifty-five days before returning to\n\nwork.       Mr. Rosado was unable to work on the action plan during\n\nhis recovery.      Mr. Morrow and Mr. Hegel directed Mr. Griffey, who\n\nhad become familiar with WPR’s operations during his earlier\n\nvisit, to return to Puerto Rico, assist in the preparation of the\n\nWPR action plan, and provide leadership in Mr. Rosado’s absence.\n\n              Mr. Rosado returned to work in April 2002, but Mr.\n\nGriffey remained at WPR.         Mr. Rosado claims that WPR employees\n\nwere now answering exclusively to Mr. Griffey’s command and that\n\nalthough when questioned as to his formal role Mr. Griffey was\n\npurposefully ambiguous, Mr. Griffey had become WPR’s de-facto\n\n\n\n        2\n     This was Mr. Rosado’s second heart attack.           His first heart\nattack took place in April 1998.\n\n                                       -4-\n\fgeneral manager.         Mr. Rosado claims that while he retained his\n\nformal title as general manager, he had lost all authority at\n\nWPR.\n\n             Shortly after Mr. Rosado returned, Mr. Hegel requested\n\nthat he review Mr. Griffey’s action plan and either approve Mr.\n\nGriffey’s plan or, in the alternative, submit his own action\n\nplan.      Mr. Rosado reviewed and, with some reservations, adopted\n\nMr. Griffey’s action plan.\n\n             In   or    around   May    2002,    Miguel    Angel   Escobar,     the\n\nPresident of Wackenhut El Salvador (“WES”), placed a telephone\n\ncall to Mr. Rosado.3        During the conversation, Mr. Escobar asked\n\nMr. Rosado, “Why don’t you retire?”               Mr. Escobar suggested that\n\n“things would probably be easier for everyone” if Mr. Rosado\n\nretired.\n\n             Approximately       one   month    later,    Mr.   Morrow   made   the\n\ndecision to terminate Mr. Rosado.               On July 12, 2002, Mr. Hegel\n\ninformed Mr. Rosado that he was terminated.                     Upon Mr. Hegel’s\n\nrecommendations, Mr. Morrow appointed Mr. Griffey as the new\n\ngeneral manager for WPR.\n\n             Mr. Rosado filed the instant action alleging violations\n\nof the ADEA, the ADA and various Puerto Rico statutes.                          The\n\ndistrict     court     granted   the    Wackenhut    defendants’     Motion     for\n\n\n\n       3\n     Like WPR, WES is a subsidiary of WII.                 WES’s leadership has\nno authority over WPR.\n\n                                        -5-\n\fSummary     Judgment   on    all    counts     of   Mr.   Rosado’s      Verified\n\nComplaint.\n\n                                      II.\n\n                       Summary Judgment Standard\n\n            The standard for summary judgment is straightforward\n\nand   well-established.        A    district    court     may   enter   summary\n\njudgment upon a showing “that there is no genuine issue as to any\n\nmaterial fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment\n\nas a matter of law.”        Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). We review summary\n\njudgment rulings de novo, construing the record evidence in the\n\nlight most favorable to, and drawing all reasonable inferences in\n\nfavor of, the nonmoving party.

It is within this procedural framework that we assess\n\nMr. Rosado's claims.        Our review is not constrained by the lower\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fcourt's stated rationale; we may affirm the entry of summary\n\njudgment   on     any   ground   supported        by   the     record.      See   Houlton\n\nCitizens' Coal. v.

See 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1).            Since there is no direct\n\nevidence   which     demonstrates      the       Wackenhut         defendants’    alleged\n\ndiscriminatory animus against Mr. Rosado, we must consider the\n\nmulti-part McDonnell Douglas test.

Applying the McDonnell\n\nDouglas framework, Mr. Rosado must first                       “demonstrate that he\n\n(1) was at least forty years of age, (2) met the employer’s\n\nlegitimate job performance expectations, (3) experienced adverse\n\nemployment action; and (4) was replaced by a person with roughly\n\nequivalent job qualifications.”              Goldman v.

The    burden   of     production        then    shifts      back   to   the\n\nemployer    who     must   rebut     the    inference         of    discrimination      by\n\narticulating some legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the\n\nadverse    employment      action.

Mr.\n\nRosado must produce evidence beyond the mere assertion that the\n\nalleged justification is implausible and show that the employer’s\n\ndiscriminatory animus actually motivated the adverse employment\n\naction.      See Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 825.\n\n              The record is devoid of any sign that anyone in a\n\ndecision-making role, including Mr. Morrow and Mr. Hegel, bore\n\nany discriminatory animus toward Mr. Rosado.                 Appellant fails to\n\npresent evidence necessary to show that the Wackenhut defendants’\n\ngiven reasons for the termination were pretextual.                        Appellant\n\nmakes sweeping statements but fails to cite to any material fact\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fin controversy in the record.                 Although appellant states that\n\n“the district court has completely ignored most, if not all, of\n\nPlaintiff’s pretext evidence,” he never discloses what evidence\n\nthe    district      court    disregarded.          Appellant’s       Brief      at     21.\n\nGenerally, appellant criticizes the district court for missing\n\nimportant considerations such as “the significance of assessing\n\nthe whole picture, proximity in time, and the employer’s control\n\nof information.”        Appellant’s Brief at 22.               But, here again, he\n\nnever states what is that pertinent evidence.\n\n             Even if we were to consider appellant’s unsupported\n\narguments,     the     evidence      fails    to    create     a   trial-worthy         age\n\ndiscrimination        claim.         Appellant      states     that       according      to\n\nWackenhut     corporate        officers      Mr.    Rosado     was    aware      that     a\n\nsensitivity report was being prepared but Mr. Rosado denies that\n\nhe    knew   the    reasons    for    Mr.    Griffey’s    visit      to    the   island.\n\nAssuming that there is contradictory testimony on this point,\n\nsuch conflict does not support the inference that the reason\n\ngiven by the Wackenhut defendants for Mr. Rosado’s termination\n\nwas a pretext for age discrimination.                Appellant also attempts to\n\ndraw some inference of pretext from the February 2002 meeting\n\nbetween Mr. Morrow and Mr. Rosado wherein Morrow discussed the\n\nsensitivity        report’s    conclusions        with   Mr.   Rosado,      which     were\n\napparently unknown to Rosado until that time.                      However, the fact\n\nthat Mr. Rosado was kept out of the loop on the sensitivity\n\n\n                                            -9-\n\freport does not in any way suggest that the Wackenhut defendants’\n\nperformance-based reasons for terminating Mr. Rosado were false.\n\n            Finally, appellant suggests that when Mr. Morrow asked\n\nhim to create an action plan for WPR, Mr. Morrow was giving Mr.\n\nRosado     an    opportunity       to   improve       the      company’s          economic\n\nsituation.        Because he was terminated less than three months\n\nafter returning to work from the heart attack, appellant suggests\n\nthat there is sufficient evidence in the record for a trier of\n\nfact to conclude that the chance Mr. Morrow gave him was just a\n\nfalse gesture in a discriminatory cover-up scheme.                           However, the\n\ntiming of his termination, standing alone or even in conjunction\n\nwith being kept out of the loop on the sensitivity report, does\n\nnot   in    any     way    suggest      that    the       Wackenhut           defendants’\n\nperformance-based reasons for terminating Mr. Rosado were false.\n\nAppellant has not presented any evidence besides his age and Mr.\n\nGriffey’s       presence    pointing     to    age        as    a   factor        in    his\n\ntermination.           Moreover,    appellant       has     made       no     attempt   to\n\ndemonstrate       that    WPR’s    economic     losses         under        Mr.   Rosado’s\n\nleadership      were     fabricated     by    the    company        to       conceal    his\n\nsuperiors’ discriminatory motives.\n\n                                   The ADA Claim\n\n            To establish a claim of disability discrimination under\n\nthe ADA, a plaintiff must prove, by a preponderance of evidence,\n\nthat he (1) was disabled within the meaning of the ADA, (2) was\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fable   to    perform   the   essential   functions    of   the   job    with   or\n\nwithout reasonable accommodation, and (3) was discharged by the\n\nemployer in whole or in part because of his disability.

Appellant\n\ndoes not allege any direct evidence of disability discrimination.\n\nHere again, in the absence of direct evidence, Mr. Rosado may\n\n“indirectly” prove his case by “using the prima facie case and\n\nburden      shifting   methods    originated     in   McDonnell        Douglas.”\n\nJacques, 96 F.3d at 511 (quoting Katz v. City Metal Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196845\"><a href=\"/opinion/196845/katz-v-city-metal-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 30 n.2 (1st Cir. 1996)).\n\n             Under McDonnell Douglas Mr. Rosado must demonstrate by\n\na preponderance of evidence that he (1) has a disability within\n\nthe meaning of the ADA, (2) is qualified to perform the essential\n\nfunctions of the job, with or without reasonable accommodations,\n\n(3) was subject to an adverse employment action by a company\n\nsubject to the ADA, (4) was replaced by a non-disabled person or\n\ntreated     less   favorably   than   non-disabled     employees,       and    (5)\n\nsuffered damages as a result.            Id.   The district court granted\n\ndefendants’ motion for summary judgment after finding that Mr.\n\nRosado failed to establish a prima facie case under the ADA.\n\n             Appellant correctly asserts that it is not necessary\n\nthat he actually be disabled, but that it is sufficient that his\n\nemployer regarded him as disabled.             Considering this theory of\n\nliability, the district court found that Mr. Rosado’s assertion\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fthat he “must have been generally perceived as impaired because\n\nof his shortness of breath” was not supported by the record.                On\n\nappeal Mr. Rosado again contends that the Wackenhut defendants\n\nterminated him because he was perceived as being “an old man who\n\nhad   suffered   a   second   heart    attack   which   prevented   him    from\n\nperforming the task required from a manager in the industry.”\n\nAppellant’s Brief at 34.            To support this statement, appellant\n\nstates that anyone observing him after he returned would have\n\nnoticed physical changes that would have led them to conclude\n\nthat he was disabled or could not do the job.            However, appellant\n\ndoes not cite to any evidence in the summary judgment record that\n\neven upon noticing his shortness of breath, anyone entertained\n\nthe belief that he was disabled.          Without providing evidence of a\n\nsingle instance of misperception by any particular person or\n\ngroup of persons, Mr. Rosado can not satisfy his prima facie\n\nburden under the ADA.\n\n             Although appellant suggests that after he returned to\n\nwork he was universally treated as if he was completely incapable\n\nof performing the duties of general manager, his only support for\n\nthis conclusion is that he was required to have Mr. Griffey\n\nauthorize his decisions before they became final.                 Mr. Rosado\n\nmakes   no   citation   to    the    evidentiary   record   to   support    the\n\nassertion that his decisions had to receive prior authorization\n\nfrom Mr. Griffey.       However, even if Mr. Griffey was exercising\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\foversight over Mr. Rosado’s decisionmaking at WPR, there is no\n\nevidence that this is related to a perception by the Wackenhut\n\ndefendants    that    Mr.    Rosado   is    disabled   rather     than    to   the\n\ntroubled financial condition of WPR and the corporate effort to\n\nimplement the action plan, which Mr. Griffey was instrumental in\n\ndeveloping.    Without record support for the inference that the\n\nalleged   oversight    was    in   some    way   connected   to   Mr.    Rosado’s\n\nshortness of breath, Mr. Rosado can not establish a prima facie\n\ncase under the ADA.\n\n           The district court’s judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\f</pre>",
