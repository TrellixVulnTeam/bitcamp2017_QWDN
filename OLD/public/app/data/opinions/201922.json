D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n                    Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                    and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n\n     Chauncey B. Wood, with whom Shea, Larocque & Wood was on brief\nfor appellant.\n     Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, with whom Paula D.\nSilsby, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                        November 16, 2005\n\f           CYR, Senior Circuit Judge.            Gerald Morrisette appeals\n\nfrom the judgment of conviction and sentence entered against him by\n\nthe district court, for distributing cocaine base, see 21 U.S.C. §\n\n841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B)(iii).    He contends that (i) the guilty plea\n\nwas not knowing and voluntary, (ii) the government failed to prove\n\nthat he possessed in excess of 50 grams of cocaine base as charged\n\nin the indictment; (iii) the court erred in determining that he did\n\nnot qualify for the “safety-valve” sentence reduction permitted\n\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f), and (iv) he is entitled to a Booker\n\nremand so as to allow the district court to consider his family and\n\nmental-health history pursuant to the advisory Guidelines regime.\n\nAs we discern no error, we affirm the district court judgment.\n\n                                     I\n\n                              BACKGROUND\n\n           On March 16, 2004, police officers discovered a zip-lock\n\nbaggy   containing   approximately       70    grams   of   crack   cocaine    at\n\nMorrisette’s   residence.     After           Morrisette    admitted   to     its\n\npossession, he was charged with a single count of possessing five\n\nor more grams of cocaine base, with intent to distribute, in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B).\n\n           On June 25, 2004, Morrisette entered a plea of guilty.\n\nIn the course of the plea colloquy, the district court inquired\n\nwhether Morrisette was under psychiatric care, and whether he was\n\ntaking medication.    He responded that he was taking Thorazine for\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fanxiety, as prescribed by a doctor at the Cumberland County Jail.\n\nThe court inquired whether the medication prevented him from\n\nunderstanding what was happening during the plea hearing, and\n\nMorrisette responded in the negative.          Prior to accepting the\n\nguilty   plea,   the   district   court   informed   Morrisette:      “I’ve\n\nobserved you and your demeanor and attitude throughout these\n\nproceedings, and I find that you’re not under the influence of any\n\nsubstance that would impair your judgment.”\n\n           Thereafter, on July 6, defense counsel obtained the\n\napproval of the district court to have Morrisette hospitalized for\n\npsychiatric evaluation, citing a troubled family history, and a\n\nmedical diagnosis that Morrisette had experienced chronic abnormal\n\nsymptoms, including, inter alia, undifferentiated schizophrenia and\n\nauditory hallucinations, as well as severe polysubstance abuse and\n\na marginal IQ. Following treatment with Zyprexa, Morrisette's\n\ncondition improved, and on August 12 he was discharged.\n\n           The presentence report (PSR) noted that Morrisette had\n\ntold the police that, in addition to the 70 grams of crack cocaine\n\ncharged in the indictment, he had possessed another 3/4 kilogram\n\nwhich he and his drug partner, Donald Couture, had acquired for\n\ndistribution.     In Morrisette's objection to the PSR, he denied\n\nmaking any such incriminating statement.\n\n           At    sentencing,   Morrisette    unsuccessfully   urged    the\n\ndistrict court to depart downward, based on (i) diminished mental\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fcapacity, citing his mental health and substance abuse problems,\n\nand (ii) family history.     The government represented to the court\n\nthat because there was no available lab analysis of the weight of\n\nthe packaging of the 70-gram baggy of cocaine, no request would be\n\nmade for imposition of the ten-year mandatory minimum sentence for\n\ndrug amounts exceeding 50 grams,         21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A)(iii),\n\nbut only for the five-year mandatory minimum sentence, id. §\n\n841(b)(1)(B)(iii).     Nevertheless, the government insisted that the\n\nSentencing Guidelines base offense level (BOL) should be determined\n\nby reference to the 70-gram amount charged in the indictment, thus\n\nyielding a BOL of 32.      Defense counsel expressly agreed with the\n\nposition stated by government counsel.\n\n            The court declined to apply the “safety valve” provisions\n\nof 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f), which would permit the imposition of a\n\nsentence below the five-year mandatory minimum in certain specified\n\ncircumstances, and cited evidence that the police had seized eleven\n\nfirearms from the Morrisette apartment during their execution of\n\nthe   search    warrant.     The   court    nevertheless    accepted   the\n\ngovernment’s recommendation that Morrisette receive a downward\n\ndeparture      for   substantial   assistance    to   the     government.\n\nUltimately, Morrisette was sentenced to 78 months’ imprisonment.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\f                                    II\n\n                               DISCUSSION\n\nA.   The Guilty Plea\n\n           Morrisette first contends that the guilty plea entered on\n\nJune 25, 2004, was neither knowing nor voluntary, see Fed. R. Crim.\n\nP. 11, since the district court was aware of his history of serious\n\nmental-health and substance-abuse problems, yet failed to ascertain\n\nwhether the medication prescribed to treat these conditions may\n\nhave prevented him from understanding what transpired at the\n\n\"change of plea\" hearing.     Morrisette cites our decision in United\n\nStates   v.   Parra-Ibanez,   936   F.2d    588   (1st   Cir.   1991),   as\n\ncontrolling authority.\n\n           We normally review the acceptance of a guilty plea only\n\nfor abuse of discretion, but since Morrisette failed either to move\n\nto withdraw his guilty plea below, see Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(d)(2),\n\nor otherwise to raise the present objections before the district\n\ncourt, we review only for plain error.            See United States v.\n\nDelgado-Hernandez, 420 F.3d 16, 19-20 (1st Cir. 2005).               Thus,\n\nMorrisette must demonstrate that (i) an error occurred, (ii) which\n\nwas obvious, (iii) affected his substantial rights, and (iv)\n\nseriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of\n\nthe judicial proceedings.      See id.     Morrisette cannot meet this\n\nheavy burden.\n\n           Competence to enter a guilty plea is determined by the\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fsame   criteria     as    those    governing        competence     to    stand    trial:\n\nwhether the defendant is able to understand the proceedings and\n\nassist his counsel with a reasonable degree of rationality.                            See\n\nUnited States v. Rodriguez-Leon, 402 F.3d 17, 22 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            The Parra-Ibanez case is readily distinguishable. Before\n\nParra-Ibanez entered his guilty plea, the district court had\n\nordered a mental evaluation and conducted a competency hearing\n\nduring which it received evidence that Parra-Ibanez was suicidal\n\nand suffered from serious mental-health problems.                             See Parra-\n\nIbanez, 936 F.2d at 591.           In contrast, since Morrisette raised no\n\nissue concerning his competency until after the change of plea\n\nhearing, the district court never learned of Morrisette’s medical\n\ndiagnosis    until       after    it    had   accepted     the    guilty      plea,    and\n\ntherefore it cannot have ignored any red flags.\n\n            In Parra-Ibanez, after the court learned that Parra-\n\nIbanez was taking three medications, it failed to question whether\n\nthe    medications       were    such    as    would    have   had      the   effect    of\n\npreventing       Parra-Ibanez      from       comprehending       the    plea    hearing\n\nproceedings.       See id. at 595-96; see also Cody v. United States,\n\n249 F.3d 47, 53 (1st Cir. 2001) (noting that the court in Parra-\n\nIbanez “failed to follow up with any question whatsoever about\n\nwhether    the    defendant’s          medication      affected    his    competence”)\n\n(emphasis added); Miranda-Gonzalez v. United States, 181 F.3d 164,\n\n166 (1st Cir. 1999) (“The absolute failure to investigate further\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fonce apprised of the recent ingestion of drugs doomed the plea\n\nentered by the defendant[] in Parra-Ibanez . . . .”) (emphasis\n\nadded).    At Morrisette’s hearing, however, the court specifically\n\ninquired     whether    the   medication     (viz.,   Thorazine)    prevented\n\nMorrisette    from     understanding    what   was    happening    during   the\n\nhearing, and Morrisette responded \"no.\"          Given the facts available\n\nto the district court at the time, its inquiry was not plainly\n\ninadequate:\n\n           Judges are not pharmacists or doctors.\n           Occasionally the aid of an expert may be\n           necessary to explain the likely or actual\n           effects of a particular drug. However,\n           practical judgments can usually be made.\n           Courts have commonly relied on the defendant's\n           own assurance (and assurances from counsel)\n           that the defendant's mind is clear. Further,\n           the defendant's own performance in the course\n           of a colloquy may confirm, or occasionally\n           undermine, his assurances. Conversely, a\n           defendant's prior medical history or behavior\n           may call for heightened vigilance.\n\nUnited States v. Savinon-Acosta, 232 F.3d 265, 268-69 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).\n\n           Neither Morrisette nor defense counsel advised the court\n\neither that the Thorazine had the potential seriously to affect\n\nMorrisette’s cognitive abilities,1 or that the Thorazine was not\n\n\n     1\n      Morrisette now contends that he was not taking Thorazine, but\nZyprexa. The difference is not material in this instance, however,\nas we must assess the plea in reference to the facts known to the\ncourt at the plea hearing. Even assuming Morrisette incorrectly\nidentified his medication regimen, defense counsel corroborated\nthat Morrisette was taking Thorazine. We may take notice, however,\nthat the Physician’s Desk Reference categorizes both these drugs as\n\n                                       -7-\n\feffectively ameliorating the symptoms associated with schizophrenia\n\nand substance abuse.     The district court asked Morrisette a series\n\nof questions regarding his understanding of the terms of the plea\n\nagreement, to which Morrisette provided cognizant and coherent\n\nresponses.2    At one point, Morrisette volunteered a statement\n\nregarding his fears of retaliation, which had prompted his request\n\nto be placed in the witness protection program.       See id. at 269\n\n(noting that defendant volunteered “more elaborate responses” to\n\nquestions susceptible of \"yes\" and \"no\" responses). Finally, after\n\nobserving Morrisette’s demeanor first hand, the district court made\n\nan explicit finding that Morrisette was competent to enter the\n\nguilty plea.   See Rodriguez-Leon, 402 F.3d at 25 n.8 (noting that\n\nappellate review is somewhat circumscribed, in that district court\n\nhad better vantage to assess defendant's demeanor).\n\n          Given    these    particular   circumstances,   therefore,\n\nMorrisette cannot demonstrate plain error, and the guilty plea\n\nstands.\n\nB.   The Drug Quantity\n\n          Morrisette next contends that the district court erred in\n\n\n\nanti-psychotics.\n     2\n      Morrisette objects that most of the answers he gave were\n\"yes\" or \"no,\" which provided a poor indication of his level of\ncomprehension. We have rejected this argument. See Rodriguez-\nLeon, 402 F.3d at 25 n.8 (noting difference between “automatic”\n\"yes\" and \"no\" answers, as distinguished from those “based on an\nunderstanding of the substance of the questions”).\n\n                                  -8-\n\fdetermining the drug quantity at 70 grams, since the prosecutor\n\nconceded at the sentencing hearing that he had not yet obtained the\n\nlaboratory   analysis    to    determine    the   relative   weight     of   the\n\npackaging and the cocaine base.        This contention likewise fails.\n\n          As Morrisette failed to assert this objection before the\n\ndistrict court, we review only for plain error.            See United States\n\nv. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 77 (1st Cir. 2005).               The Sixth\n\nAmendment right to jury trial is not offended where the defendant\n\nwas sentenced on the basis of admitted facts.         See United States v.\n\nBooker, 125 S. Ct. 738, 756 (2005). Before Morrisette entered into\n\nplea   negotiations     with    the   government,    the     district    court\n\nexplicitly warned him that “70 grams is the crack quantity on which\n\nyou will be sentenced unless you make a different arrangement [with\n\nthe government].”     During the Rule 11 colloquy, the district court\n\ninformed Morrisette that, given the recent decision in Blakely v.\n\nWashington, 542 U.S. 296 (2004) (invalidating state sentencing\n\nguidelines similar to the federal Guidelines), it was possible that\n\nthe Supreme Court might determine that the Guidelines violated a\n\ndefendant’s Sixth Amendment rights where the court predicated its\n\nsentence upon a drug quantity not determined by a jury. Morrisette\n\nand defense counsel both conceded the accuracy of the prosecution’s\n\nrecitation of the facts relevant to the offense, including the fact\n\nthat the police recovered a zip-lock baggy containing approximately\n\n70 grams of crack cocaine.       Subsequently, Morrisette again failed\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fto object when the PSR stated that he had possessed approximately\n\n70 grams of crack cocaine and thus should be ascribed a BOL of 32.\n\nAs Morrisette consistently admitted to possessing 70 grams of crack\n\ncocaine, the district court did not commit plain error in utilizing\n\nthat amount in establishing the BOL.        See, e.g., United States v.\n\nRiggs, 347 F.3d 17, 20 (1st Cir. 2003), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1126\n\n(2004).\n\n             Government counsel's concession, at sentencing, that the\n\ngovernment was not then prepared to establish that the weight of\n\nthe cocaine (as contrasted with the weight of its packaging)\n\nexceeded 70 grams, in no sense mitigated Morrisette’s waiver.\n\nGovernment counsel addressed the matter only as it applied to the\n\ngovernment's decision not to seek the higher statutory mandatory\n\nten-year minimum sentence, imposed for drug quantities exceeding 50\n\ngrams, rather than the 5-year minimum for amounts less than 50\n\ngrams.    Moreover, defense counsel explicitly agreed with this\n\ntreatment, by representing to the court that Morrisette wanted to\n\n“mak[e] a compromise:      the mandatory minimum five years, not to\n\nfight, agreeing to more than 50 [grams] for an offense level of\n\n32.”   Furthermore, defense counsel characterized the government’s\n\nconcession as “reasonable under the circumstances,” and requested\n\nthat   the    district   court   “accept”   the   government’s   proposed\n\napproach.     Given these stark circumstances, Morrisette can hardly\n\nassert plain error.\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\f          Further,     we   would   note   that   the   motivations   for\n\nMorrisette’s agreement to the “compromise” are readily apparent.\n\nFirst, although not the subject of evidentiary demonstration, on\n\nthe present record, it is highly implausible that the weight of the\n\npackaging – a zip-lock baggy – would constitute 29% of the total\n\nweight of the package and its contents, viz., 70 grams.          Second,\n\nthe government could have included in the indictment the 3/4\n\nkilogram of crack cocaine which Morrisette allegedly admitted\n\npossessing with his drug partner Donald Couture. Finally, the fact\n\nthat the government had yet to receive a lab analysis as to the\n\nweight of the drug package at the time of sentencing cannot be\n\npresumed to mean that the government could not have presented the\n\nanalysis at trial had Morrisette rejected the plea agreement.         The\n\nMorrisette admission that he possessed 70 grams of crack cocaine\n\nwas obviously strategic, as it benefitted him considerably at\n\nsentencing. Accordingly, we discern no plain error in the district\n\ncourt’s determination of the drug quantity as 70 grams, with a\n\nresulting BOL of 32.\n\nC.   The “Safety Valve” Provision\n\n          The “safety valve” provision in the Sentencing Guidelines\n\nordains that the district court ought not impose the statutory\n\nmandatory minimum sentence where the defendant has satisfied five\n\ncriteria, including the criterion that the defendant did not\n\npossess a firearm in connection with the offense of conviction. 18\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fU.S.C. § 3553(f)(2); U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(7).               Morrisette maintains\n\nthat the district court violated the Sixth Amendment by crediting\n\nevidence that the police found eleven firearms in Morrisette's\n\napartment     during   their    execution       of   the   search   warrant,    a\n\nsentencing fact that (according to Morrisette) Blakely determined\n\nmust be either decided by a jury or admitted by the defendant.                  We\n\ndisagree.\n\n            The “safety valve” provision serves to reduce a sentence\n\nbelow the statutory mandatory minimum sentence, and thus the burden\n\nof proof rests with the defendant to establish the five criteria\n\nset out in subsection 3553(f).             See United States v. McLean, 409\n\nF.3d 492, 502 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, No. 05-6286, 2005 WL\n\n2494179 (U.S. Oct. 11, 2005).             Blakely, and by extension Booker,\n\nexpressly     relate   only    to   the     constitutionality       of   judicial\n\nfactfinding    which   results      in    sentencing   enhancements,      not   to\n\nsentencing reductions.         See United States v. De Los Santos, 420\n\nF.3d 10, 13 n.3 (1st Cir. 2005); United States v. Bermudez, 407\n\nF.3d 536, 545 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 126 S. Ct. 304 (2005); see\n\nalso United States v. Payton, 405 F.3d 1168, 1173 (10th Cir. 2005).\n\nAccordingly, the district court finding that Morrisette failed to\n\nestablish that he did not possess a firearm in connection with the\n\noffense of conviction is not subject to this type of Blakely-Booker\n\nchallenge.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -12-\n\fD.    Post-Booker Remand\n\n           Finally, Morrisette contends that we must vacate and\n\nremand for resentencing in light of Booker, because there is a\n\n“reasonable probability” that the district court would impose a\n\nmore favorable sentence under the post-Booker sentencing regime,\n\nwhich treats the Sentencing Guidelines as advisory rather than\n\nmandatory.   See Antonakopolous, 399 F.3d at 75.       Morrisette cites\n\nseveral factors which the district court might now consider grounds\n\nfor   imposing   a   sentence   below    the   corresponding   Guidelines\n\nsentence, including his troubled family history,3 and his history\n\nof serious untreated mental illness.\n\n           The fatal flaw in these contentions is that the district\n\ncourt was presented with all of this evidence, yet decided that\n\nMorrisette's contentions bore no relevance in determining whether\n\nto grant a downward departure.      Under the Sentencing Guidelines,\n\nfamily history and mental illness are merely discouraged grounds\n\nfor departure, not forbidden grounds.           See U.S.S.G. §§ 5H1.2,\n\n5H1.3, 5H1.4.     We ordinarily have refused to order post-Booker\n\nremands where – as here – the district court had before it all the\n\nevidence material to these factors, yet demonstrated no inclination\n\n\n\n      3\n      Morrisette adduced evidence that his parents were poor, had\nserious mental illnesses, were alcoholics, and were physically\nabusive. He himself was illiterate and had only limited education\n(through sixth grade). His mother put him out of the house when he\nwas twelve-years-old, whereupon he began using illegal drugs and\nabusing alcohol.\n\n                                  -13-\n\fto consider them grounds for departure.

As we discern no error, we affirm the district court judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">* <i>BACKGROUND</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 16, 2004, police officers discovered a zip-lock baggy containing approximately 70 grams of crack cocaine at Morrisette's residence. After Morrisette admitted to its possession, he was charged with a single count of possessing five or more grams of cocaine base, with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 25, 2004, Morrisette entered a plea of guilty. In the course of the plea colloquy, the district court inquired whether Morrisette was under psychiatric care, and whether he was taking medication. He responded that he was taking Thorazine for anxiety, as prescribed by a doctor at the Cumberland County Jail. The court inquired whether the medication prevented him from understanding what was happening during the plea hearing, and Morrisette responded in the negative. Prior to accepting the guilty plea, the district court informed Morrisette: \"I've observed you and your demeanor and attitude throughout these proceedings, and I find that you're not under the influence of any substance that would impair your judgment.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, on July 6, defense counsel obtained the approval of the district court to have Morrisette hospitalized for psychiatric evaluation, citing a troubled family history, and a medical diagnosis that Morrisette had experienced chronic abnormal symptoms, including, <i>inter alia,</i> undifferentiated schizophrenia and auditory hallucinations, as well as severe polysubstance abuse and a marginal IQ. Following treatment with Zyprexa, Morrisette's condition improved, and on August 12 he was discharged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The presentence report (PSR) noted that Morrisette had told the police that, in addition to the 70 grams of crack cocaine charged in the indictment, he had possessed another 3/4 kilogram which he and his drug partner, Donald Couture, had acquired for distribution. In Morrisette's objection to the PSR, he denied making any such incriminating statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, Morrisette unsuccessfully urged the district court to depart downward, based on (i) diminished mental capacity, citing his mental health and substance abuse problems, and (ii) family history. The government represented to the court that because there was no available lab analysis of the weight of the packaging of the 70-gram baggy of cocaine, no request would be made for imposition of the ten-year mandatory minimum sentence for drug amounts exceeding 50 grams, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A)(iii), but only for the five-year mandatory minimum sentence, <i>id.</i> &#167; 841(b)(1)(B)(iii). Nevertheless, the government insisted that the Sentencing Guidelines base offense level (BOL) should be determined by reference to the 70-gram amount charged in the indictment, thus yielding a BOL of 32. Defense counsel expressly agreed with the position stated by government counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court declined to apply the \"safety valve\" provisions of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f), which would permit the imposition of a sentence below the five-year mandatory minimum in certain specified circumstances, and cited evidence that the police had seized eleven firearms from the Morrisette apartment during their execution of the search warrant. The court nevertheless accepted the government's recommendation that Morrisette receive a downward departure for substantial assistance to the government. Ultimately, Morrisette was sentenced to 78 months' imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>DISCUSSION</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Guilty Plea</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morrisette first contends that the guilty plea entered on June 25, 2004, was neither knowing nor voluntary, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 11, since the district court was aware of his history of serious mental-health and substance-abuse problems, yet failed to ascertain whether the medication prescribed to treat these conditions may have prevented him from understanding what transpired at the \"change of plea\" hearing. Morrisette cites our decision in <i>United States v. Parra-Ibanez,</i> 936 F.2d 588 (1st Cir.1991), as controlling authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We normally review the acceptance of a guilty plea only for abuse of discretion, but since Morrisette failed either to move to withdraw his guilty plea below, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(d)(2), or otherwise to raise the present objections before the district court, we review only for plain error. <i>See United States v. Delgado-Hernandez,</i> 420 F.3d 16, 19-20 (1st Cir.2005). Thus, Morrisette must demonstrate that (i) an error occurred, (ii) which was obvious, (iii) affected his substantial rights, and (iv) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <i>See id.</i> Morrisette cannot meet this heavy burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Competence to enter a guilty plea is determined by the same criteria as those governing competence to stand trial: whether the defendant is able to understand the proceedings and assist his counsel with a reasonable degree of rationality. <i>See United States v. Rodriguez-Leon,</i> 402 F.3d 17, 22 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Parra-Ibanez</i> case is readily distinguishable. Before Parra-Ibanez entered his guilty plea, the district court had ordered a mental evaluation and conducted a competency hearing during which it received evidence that Parra-Ibanez was suicidal and suffered from serious mental-health problems. <i>See Parra-Ibanez,</i> 936 F.2d at 591. In contrast, since Morrisette raised no issue concerning his competency until <i>after</i> the change of plea hearing, the district court never learned of Morrisette's medical diagnosis until <i>after</i> it had accepted the guilty plea, and therefore it cannot have ignored any red flags.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Parra-Ibanez,</i> after the court learned that Parra-Ibanez was taking three medications, it failed to question whether the medications were such as would have had the effect of preventing Parra-Ibanez from comprehending the plea hearing proceedings. <i>See id.</i> at 595-96; <i>see also Cody v. United States,</i> 249 F.3d 47, 53 (1st Cir.2001) (noting that the court in <i>Parra-Ibanez</i> \"failed to follow up with <i>any</i> question whatsoever about whether the defendant's medication affected his competence\") (emphasis added); <i>Miranda-Gonzalez v. United States,</i> 181 F.3d 164, 166 (1st Cir.1999) (\"The <i>absolute</i> failure to investigate further once apprised of the recent ingestion of drugs doomed the plea entered by the defendant[ ] in <i>Parra-Ibanez</i>....\") (emphasis added). At Morrisette's hearing, however, the court specifically inquired whether the medication (<i>viz.,</i> Thorazine) prevented Morrisette from understanding what was happening during the hearing, and Morrisette responded \"no.\" Given the facts available to the district court at the time, its inquiry was not plainly inadequate:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judges are not pharmacists or doctors. Occasionally the aid of an expert may be necessary to explain the likely or actual effects of a particular drug. However, practical judgments can usually be made. Courts have commonly relied on the defendant's own assurance (and assurances from counsel) that the defendant's mind is clear. Further, the defendant's own performance in the course of a colloquy may confirm, or occasionally undermine, his assurances. Conversely, a defendant's prior medical history or behavior may call for heightened vigilance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v. Savinon-Acosta,</i> 232 F.3d 265, 268-69 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither Morrisette nor defense counsel advised the court <i>either</i> that the Thorazine had the potential seriously to affect Morrisette's cognitive abilities,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> <i>or</i> that the Thorazine was not effectively ameliorating the symptoms associated with schizophrenia and substance abuse. The district court asked Morrisette a series of questions regarding his understanding of the terms of the plea agreement, to which Morrisette provided cognizant and coherent responses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> At one point, Morrisette volunteered a statement regarding his fears of retaliation, which had prompted his request to be placed in the witness protection program. <i>See id.</i> at 269 (noting that defendant volunteered \"more elaborate responses\" to questions susceptible of \"yes\" and \"no\" responses). Finally, after observing Morrisette's demeanor first hand, the district court made an explicit finding that Morrisette was competent to enter the guilty plea. <i>See Rodriguez-Leon,</i> 402 F.3d at 25 n. 8 (noting that appellate review is somewhat circumscribed, in that district court had better vantage to assess defendant's demeanor).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given these particular circumstances, therefore, Morrisette cannot demonstrate plain error, and the guilty plea stands.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The Drug Quantity</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morrisette next contends that the district court erred in determining the drug quantity at 70 grams, since the prosecutor conceded at the sentencing hearing that he had not yet obtained the laboratory analysis to determine the relative weight of the packaging and the cocaine base. This contention likewise fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Morrisette failed to assert this objection before the district court, we review only for plain error. <i>See United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d 68, 77 (1st Cir.2005). The Sixth Amendment right to jury trial is not offended where the defendant was sentenced on the basis of admitted facts. <i>See United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 756, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Before Morrisette entered into plea negotiations with the government, the district court explicitly warned him that \"70 grams is the crack quantity on which you will be sentenced unless you make a different arrangement [with the government].\" During the Rule 11 colloquy, the district court informed Morrisette that, given the recent decision in <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) (invalidating state sentencing guidelines similar to the federal Guidelines), it was possible that the Supreme Court might determine that the Guidelines violated a defendant's Sixth Amendment rights where the court predicated its sentence upon a drug quantity not determined by a jury. Morrisette and defense counsel both conceded the accuracy of the prosecution's recitation of the facts relevant to the offense, including the fact that the police recovered a zip-lock baggy containing approximately 70 grams of crack cocaine. Subsequently, Morrisette again failed to object when the PSR stated that he had possessed approximately 70 grams of crack cocaine and thus should be ascribed a BOL of 32. As Morrisette consistently admitted to possessing 70 grams of crack cocaine, the district court did not commit plain error in utilizing that amount in establishing the BOL. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Riggs,</i> 347 F.3d 17, 20 (1st Cir.2003), <i>cert. denied,</i> 540 U.S. 1126, 124 S.Ct. 1095, 157 L.Ed.2d 927 (2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Government counsel's concession, at sentencing, that the government was not then prepared to establish that the weight of the cocaine (as contrasted with the weight of its packaging) exceeded 70 grams, in no sense mitigated Morrisette's waiver. Government counsel addressed the matter only as it applied to the government's decision not to seek the higher statutory mandatory ten-year minimum sentence, imposed for drug quantities exceeding 50 grams, rather than the 5-year minimum for amounts less than 50 grams. Moreover, defense counsel explicitly agreed with this treatment, by representing to the court that Morrisette wanted to \"mak[e] a compromise: the mandatory minimum five years, not to fight, agreeing to more than 50 [grams] for an offense level of 32.\" Furthermore, defense counsel characterized the government's concession as \"reasonable under the circumstances,\" and requested that the district court \"accept\" the government's proposed approach. Given these stark circumstances, Morrisette can hardly assert plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, we would note that the motivations for Morrisette's agreement to the \"compromise\" are readily apparent. First, although not the subject of evidentiary demonstration, on the present record, it is highly implausible that the weight of the packaging &#8212; a zip-lock baggy &#8212; would constitute 29% of the total weight of the package and its contents, <i>viz.,</i> 70 grams. Second, the government could have included in the indictment the 3/4 kilogram of crack cocaine which Morrisette allegedly admitted possessing with his drug partner Donald Couture. Finally, the fact that the government had yet to receive a lab analysis as to the weight of the drug package at the time of sentencing cannot be presumed to mean that the government could not have presented the analysis at trial had Morrisette rejected the plea agreement. The Morrisette admission that he possessed 70 grams of crack cocaine was obviously strategic, as it benefitted him considerably at sentencing. Accordingly, we discern no plain error in the district court's determination of the drug quantity as 70 grams, with a resulting BOL of 32.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>The \"Safety Valve\" Provision</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"safety valve\" provision in the Sentencing Guidelines ordains that the district court ought not impose the statutory mandatory minimum sentence where the defendant has satisfied five criteria, including the criterion that the defendant did not possess a firearm in connection with the offense of conviction. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f)(2); U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(b)(7). Morrisette maintains that the district court violated the Sixth Amendment by crediting evidence that the police found eleven firearms in Morrisette's apartment during their execution of the search warrant, a sentencing fact that (according to Morrisette) <i>Blakely</i> determined must be either decided by a jury or admitted by the defendant. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"safety valve\" provision serves to reduce a sentence below the statutory mandatory minimum sentence, and thus the burden of proof rests with the defendant to establish the five criteria set out in subsection 3553(f). <i>See United States v. McLean,</i> 409 F.3d 492, 502 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 466, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2005). <i>Blakely,</i> and by extension <i>Booker,</i> expressly relate only to the constitutionality of judicial factfinding which results in sentencing enhancements, <i>not to sentencing reductions. See United States v. De Los Santos,</i> 420 F.3d 10, 13 n. 3 (1st Cir.2005); <i>United States v. Bermudez,</i> 407 F.3d 536, 545 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 304, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2005); <i>see also United States v. Payton,</i> 405 F.3d 1168, 1173 (10th Cir.2005). Accordingly, the district court finding that Morrisette failed to establish that he did not possess a firearm in connection with the offense of conviction is not subject to this type of <i>Blakely-Booker</i> challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. <i>Post-Booker Remand</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Morrisette contends that we must vacate and remand for resentencing in light of <i>Booker,</i> because there is a \"reasonable probability\" that the district court would impose a more favorable sentence under the post-<i>Booker</i> sentencing regime, which treats the Sentencing Guidelines as advisory rather than mandatory. <i>See Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 75. Morrisette cites several factors which the district court might now consider grounds for imposing a sentence below the corresponding Guidelines sentence, including his troubled family history,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and his history of serious untreated mental illness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fatal flaw in these contentions is that the district court was presented with all of this evidence, yet decided that Morrisette's contentions bore no relevance in determining whether to grant a downward departure. Under the Sentencing Guidelines, family history and mental illness are merely discouraged grounds for departure, not forbidden grounds. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 5H1.2, 5H1.3, 5H1.4. We ordinarily have refused to order post-<i>Booker</i> remands where &#8212; as here &#8212; the district court had before it all the evidence material to these factors, yet demonstrated no inclination to consider them grounds for departure. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Martins,</i> 413 F.3d 139, 154 (1st Cir.2005) (\"Nearly all the factors to which [defendant] alludes were limned in the PSI Report, yet the district court chose not to speak to them at sentencing. The inference is that the court was unimpressed.\"). For example, in denying the \"diminished capacity\" departure, the court stated: \"[T]he psychiatric report ... does not establish that [his] significantly reduced mental capacity contributed substantially to the commission of this offense.\" We therefore see no reasonable probability that the district court would reconsider the relevance of such evidence under the now-advisory Guidelines regime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Morrisette now contends that he was not taking Thorazine, but Zyprexa. The difference is not material in this instance, however, as we must assess the plea in reference to the facts known to the court at the plea hearing. Even assuming Morrisette incorrectly identified his medication regimen, defense counsel corroborated that Morrisette was taking Thorazine.

Following treatment with Zyprexa, Morrisette's condition improved, and on August 12 he was discharged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The presentence report (PSR) noted that Morrisette had told the police that, in addition to the 70 grams of crack cocaine charged in the indictment, he had possessed another 3/4 kilogram which he and his drug partner, Donald Couture, had acquired for distribution. In Morrisette's objection to the PSR, he denied making any such incriminating statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, Morrisette unsuccessfully urged the district court to depart downward, based on (i) diminished mental capacity, citing his mental health and substance abuse problems, and (ii) family history. The government represented to the court that because there was no available lab analysis of the weight of the packaging of the 70-gram baggy of cocaine, no request would be made for imposition of the ten-year mandatory minimum sentence for drug amounts exceeding 50 grams, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A)(iii), but only for the five-year mandatory minimum sentence, <i>id.</i> &#167; 841(b)(1)(B)(iii). Nevertheless, the government insisted that the Sentencing Guidelines base offense level (BOL) should be determined by reference to the 70-gram amount charged in the indictment, thus yielding a BOL of 32. Defense counsel expressly agreed with the position stated by government counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court declined to apply the \"safety valve\" provisions of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f), which would permit the imposition of a sentence below the five-year mandatory minimum in certain specified circumstances, and cited evidence that the police had seized eleven firearms from the Morrisette apartment during their execution of the search warrant. The court nevertheless accepted the government's recommendation that Morrisette receive a downward departure for substantial assistance to the government. Ultimately, Morrisette was sentenced to 78 months' imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>DISCUSSION</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Guilty Plea</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morrisette first contends that the guilty plea entered on June 25, 2004, was neither knowing nor voluntary, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 11, since the district court was aware of his history of serious mental-health and substance-abuse problems, yet failed to ascertain whether the medication prescribed to treat these conditions may have prevented him from understanding what transpired at the \"change of plea\" hearing.

Thus, Morrisette must demonstrate that (i) an error occurred, (ii) which was obvious, (iii) affected his substantial rights, and (iv) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <i>See id.</i> Morrisette cannot meet this heavy burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Competence to enter a guilty plea is determined by the same criteria as those governing competence to stand trial: whether the defendant is able to understand the proceedings and assist his counsel with a reasonable degree of rationality. <i>See United States v.

Before Parra-Ibanez entered his guilty plea, the district court had ordered a mental evaluation and conducted a competency hearing during which it received evidence that Parra-Ibanez was suicidal and suffered from serious mental-health problems. <i>See Parra-Ibanez,</i> 936 F.2d at 591. In contrast, since Morrisette raised no issue concerning his competency until <i>after</i> the change of plea hearing, the district court never learned of Morrisette's medical diagnosis until <i>after</i> it had accepted the guilty plea, and therefore it cannot have ignored any red flags.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Parra-Ibanez,</i> after the court learned that Parra-Ibanez was taking three medications, it failed to question whether the medications were such as would have had the effect of preventing Parra-Ibanez from comprehending the plea hearing proceedings. <i>See id.</i> at 595-96; <i>see also Cody v.

At Morrisette's hearing, however, the court specifically inquired whether the medication (<i>viz.,</i> Thorazine) prevented Morrisette from understanding what was happening during the hearing, and Morrisette responded \"no.\" Given the facts available to the district court at the time, its inquiry was not plainly inadequate:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judges are not pharmacists or doctors.

Courts have commonly relied on the defendant's own assurance (and assurances from counsel) that the defendant's mind is clear. Further, the defendant's own performance in the course of a colloquy may confirm, or occasionally undermine, his assurances.

Finally, after observing Morrisette's demeanor first hand, the district court made an explicit finding that Morrisette was competent to enter the guilty plea. <i>See Rodriguez-Leon,</i> 402 F.3d at 25 n. 8 (noting that appellate review is somewhat circumscribed, in that district court had better vantage to assess defendant's demeanor).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given these particular circumstances, therefore, Morrisette cannot demonstrate plain error, and the guilty plea stands.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The Drug Quantity</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morrisette next contends that the district court erred in determining the drug quantity at 70 grams, since the prosecutor conceded at the sentencing hearing that he had not yet obtained the laboratory analysis to determine the relative weight of the packaging and the cocaine base. This contention likewise fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Morrisette failed to assert this objection before the district court, we review only for plain error. <i>See United States v.

The Sixth Amendment right to jury trial is not offended where the defendant was sentenced on the basis of admitted facts. <i>See United States v. Booker,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></span> (2005). Before Morrisette entered into plea negotiations with the government, the district court explicitly warned him that \"70 grams is the crack quantity on which you will be sentenced unless you make a different arrangement [with the government].\" During the Rule 11 colloquy, the district court informed Morrisette that, given the recent decision in <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136995\"><a href=\"/opinion/136995/blakely-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136995\"><a href=\"/opinion/136995/blakely-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">403</span></a></span> (2004) (invalidating state sentencing guidelines similar to the federal Guidelines), it was possible that the Supreme Court might determine that the Guidelines violated a defendant's Sixth Amendment rights where the court predicated its sentence upon a drug quantity not determined by a jury. Morrisette and defense counsel both conceded the accuracy of the prosecution's recitation of the facts relevant to the offense, including the fact that the police recovered a zip-lock baggy containing approximately 70 grams of crack cocaine. Subsequently, Morrisette again failed to object when the PSR stated that he had possessed approximately 70 grams of crack cocaine and thus should be ascribed a BOL of 32. As Morrisette consistently admitted to possessing 70 grams of crack cocaine, the district court did not commit plain error in utilizing that amount in establishing the BOL. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Riggs,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200692\"><a href=\"/opinion/200692/united-states-v-riggs/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 20 (1st Cir.2003), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1126</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Government counsel addressed the matter only as it applied to the government's decision not to seek the higher statutory mandatory ten-year minimum sentence, imposed for drug quantities exceeding 50 grams, rather than the 5-year minimum for amounts less than 50 grams. Moreover, defense counsel explicitly agreed with this treatment, by representing to the court that Morrisette wanted to \"mak[e] a compromise: the mandatory minimum five years, not to fight, agreeing to more than 50 [grams] for an offense level of 32.\" Furthermore, defense counsel characterized the government's concession as \"reasonable under the circumstances,\" and requested that the district court \"accept\" the government's proposed approach. Given these stark circumstances, Morrisette can hardly assert plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, we would note that the motivations for Morrisette's agreement to the \"compromise\" are readily apparent. First, although not the subject of evidentiary demonstration, on the present record, it is highly implausible that the weight of the packaging &#8212; a zip-lock baggy &#8212; would constitute 29% of the total weight of the package and its contents, <i>viz.,</i> 70 grams. Second, the government could have included in the indictment the 3/4 kilogram of crack cocaine which Morrisette allegedly admitted possessing with his drug partner Donald Couture. Finally, the fact that the government had yet to receive a lab analysis as to the weight of the drug package at the time of sentencing cannot be presumed to mean that the government could not have presented the analysis at trial had Morrisette rejected the plea agreement. The Morrisette admission that he possessed 70 grams of crack cocaine was obviously strategic, as it benefitted him considerably at sentencing. Accordingly, we discern no plain error in the district court's determination of the drug quantity as 70 grams, with a resulting BOL of 32.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>The \"Safety Valve\" Provision</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"safety valve\" provision in the Sentencing Guidelines ordains that the district court ought not impose the statutory mandatory minimum sentence where the defendant has satisfied five criteria, including the criterion that the defendant did not possess a firearm in connection with the offense of conviction. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f)(2); U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(b)(7). Morrisette maintains that the district court violated the Sixth Amendment by crediting evidence that the police found eleven firearms in Morrisette's apartment during their execution of the search warrant, a sentencing fact that (according to Morrisette) <i>Blakely</i> determined must be either decided by a jury or admitted by the defendant. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"safety valve\" provision serves to reduce a sentence below the statutory mandatory minimum sentence, and thus the burden of proof rests with the defendant to establish the five criteria set out in subsection 3553(f). <i>See United States v. McLean,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790402\"><a href=\"/opinion/790402/united-states-v-dale-mclean-united-states-of-america-v-manolin-feliz/\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></a></span>, 502 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></span>, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2005). <i>Blakely,</i> and by extension <i>Booker,</i> expressly relate only to the constitutionality of judicial factfinding which results in sentencing enhancements, <i>not to sentencing reductions.

Accordingly, the district court finding that Morrisette failed to establish that he did not possess a firearm in connection with the offense of conviction is not subject to this type of <i>Blakely-Booker</i> challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. <i>Post-Booker Remand</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Morrisette contends that we must vacate and remand for resentencing in light of <i>Booker,</i> because there is a \"reasonable probability\" that the district court would impose a more favorable sentence under the post-<i>Booker</i> sentencing regime, which treats the Sentencing Guidelines as advisory rather than mandatory. <i>See Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 75. Morrisette cites several factors which the district court might now consider grounds for imposing a sentence below the corresponding Guidelines sentence, including his troubled family history,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and his history of serious untreated mental illness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fatal flaw in these contentions is that the district court was presented with all of this evidence, yet decided that Morrisette's contentions bore no relevance in determining whether to grant a downward departure. Under the Sentencing Guidelines, family history and mental illness are merely discouraged grounds for departure, not forbidden grounds. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 5H1.2, 5H1.3, 5H1.4. We ordinarily have refused to order post-<i>Booker</i> remands where &#8212; as here &#8212; the district court had before it all the evidence material to these factors, yet demonstrated no inclination to consider them grounds for departure. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Martins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201656\"><a href=\"/opinion/201656/united-states-v-martins/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></a></span>, 154 (1st Cir.2005) (\"Nearly all the factors to which [defendant] alludes were limned in the PSI Report, yet the district court chose not to speak to them at sentencing. The inference is that the court was unimpressed.\"). For example, in denying the \"diminished capacity\" departure, the court stated: \"[T]he psychiatric report ... does not establish that [his] significantly reduced mental capacity contributed substantially to the commission of this offense.\" We therefore see no reasonable probability that the district court would reconsider the relevance of such evidence under the now-advisory Guidelines regime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Morrisette now contends that he was not taking Thorazine, but Zyprexa.
