Co-defendants-appellants Tomás\n\nGarcía-Carrasquillo, José R. Claudio-García, and Reynaldo González-\n\nRivera were convicted of multiple counts involving the possession\n\nof drugs and firearms. On appeal, García-Carrasquillo and Claudio-\n\nGarcía challenge the sufficiency of the evidence against them, and\n\nGonzález-Rivera challenges various aspects of his sentence.             After\n\ncareful    consideration,   we    affirm        García-Carrasquillo's    and\n\nClaudio-García's   convictions,    but     we    vacate   González-Rivera's\n\nsentence and remand for re-sentencing due to the inadequacy of the\n\ndistrict court's explanation for selecting the sentence imposed.\n\n                            I. Background\n\nA. The Scene of the Crime\n\n           On May 9, 2003, at approximately 5:45 p.m., Agents Héctor\n\nValentín and Nelson González-Rodríguez of the Puerto Rico Police\n\nDepartment's Special Arrests and Extraditions Division established\n\nsurveillance of a residence in the Río Grande area of northeastern\n\nPuerto Rico, in relation to two local felony arrest warrants for\n\nGarcía-Carrasquillo and a fugitive arrest warrant for Claudio-\n\nGarcía.1   The split-level house consisted of the main residence on\n\nthe upper level, and a small ground-level apartment accessed by a\n\ndoor under a carport at the front of the house.           The carport stood\n\nover a driveway that led to a gate and then out to the road in\n\n\n1\n   Claudio-García had been serving a sentence at Camp Santana, a\nPuerto Rico institution for minors, when he left on a three-day\npass and never returned.\n\n                                  -2-\n\ffront of the house.   The agents parked their unmarked car on the\n\nroad approximately 100 meters up a hill from the house, where they\n\ncould observe activity around the house with binoculars.       From\n\ntheir vantage point, they could see a Ford Bronco parked under the\n\ncarport at the front of the house.    They could not see the door to\n\nthe ground-level apartment located behind the Bronco, nor could\n\nthey see a short staircase on the left side of the carport.2   They\n\ncould, however, see the staircase leading to the main entrance on\n\nthe upper level of the house.\n\n           Around two hours later, a stolen Mazda Protegé3 pulled up\n\nand parked on the road in front of the house, outside a gate across\n\nthe driveway.   García-Carrasquillo and Claudio-García exited the\n\nvehicle and entered the carport, presumably to enter the ground-\n\nlevel apartment at the rear of the carport, though it is unclear\n\nwhether the agents actually saw the men enter, or later exit,\n\nthrough the door to the apartment.4   Fifteen minutes later, García-\n\nCarrasquillo walked out from under the carport carrying an assault\n\n\n\n\n2\n    It is not clear where this staircase led.\n3\n    The agents had previously followed García-Carrasquillo's\ngirlfriend to the same residence, where she had left with an\nunknown individual in the same Mazda Protegé, which the agents then\ndetermined had been stolen from an auto dealer.\n4\n   Agent González-Rodríguez testified that he could not see the\napartment door at any time, while Agent Valentín testified that at\nsome point during the surveillance he observed both men entering\nand exiting through the apartment door.\n\n                                -3-\n\frifle, which he placed in the trunk of the Mazda Protegé.   He then\n\nreturned to the carport.\n\n          At this point, the agents notified their supervisor,\n\nLieutenant Herminio Díaz, of the situation.        Lieutenant Díaz\n\nmobilized the SWAT team and posted two agents, José Nevárez Ortiz\n\nand Richard Carrera, at the back of the house.     As the SWAT team\n\napproached the house, José David Cruz-González, the owner of the\n\nhouse, who was somewhere outside the gate across the driveway in\n\nfront of the house,5 ran through the gate toward the house shouting\n\nthat the police were there.   The three co-defendants in the case,\n\nGarcía-Carrasquillo, Claudio-García, and González-Rivera, then ran\n\nout of the ground-level apartment and joined Cruz-González in\n\nfleeing towards the back of the house.\n\n          At the back of the house, the four men jumped over a\n\nfence and continued to run.   Agent Nevárez shouted for the men to\n\nstop and told them they were under arrest.   The fleeing men and the\n\nofficers then exchanged gunfire; González-Rivera was shot in the\n\nleg.   The men continued to run and exchange gunfire with the\n\npursuing police until the four men fell into a large hole in the\n\nground,6 where they were apprehended and arrested.    The three co-\n\n\n\n5\n    Agent González-Rodríguez testified at one point that Cruz-\nGonzález was \"just lying\" in the road in front of the house.\n6\n    According to Agent González-Rodríguez, the \"big hole\" was\napproximately ten feet long by ten feet wide and eight feet deep,\nand was possibly part of a septic tank under construction.\n\n                                -4-\n\fdefendants were each found with loaded firearms on their persons;\n\nhowever, no drugs or paraphernalia were found on any of the\n\ndefendants at the time of their arrest.\n\n            Meanwhile, back at the house, the SWAT team, Lieutenant\n\nDíaz, and Agent Valentín searched the ground-level apartment, where\n\nthey found a large amount of cocaine and cocaine base (crack\n\ncocaine),    a   small   amount   of   marijuana,   and    assorted   drug\n\nparaphernalia, including a stove for cooking crack cocaine and\n\nitems used to break up cocaine rocks.           The cocaine base was\n\npackaged in approximately 972 vials, which were placed in plastic\n\nbags labeled by drug distribution point.        The Mazda Protegé was\n\ntaken to the police station after the arrest; when the police\n\nopened the trunk, they found an AR-15 rifle along with the AK-47\n\nthat the agents had seen García-Carrasquillo put there during their\n\nsurveillance.    The police did not take any fingerprints from the\n\ndrugs, paraphernalia, or firearms recovered from the apartment or\n\nthe vehicle, nor from the firearms found on the defendants at the\n\ntime of their arrest.\n\nB. Legal Proceedings\n\n            On May 10, 2003, the defendants were taken before a local\n\nmagistrate judge for a probable cause hearing.            After the judge\n\nadvised the defendants of their right to remain silent, García-\n\nCarrasquillo voluntarily disclosed that all of the drugs and\n\nfirearms seized the previous day belonged to him.\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f           On December 17, 2003, a grand jury returned a seven-count\n\nSuperseding Indictment against the defendants.7 Counts One and Two\n\ncharged that all three defendants, aiding and abetting each other,\n\nknowingly possessed with the intent to distribute 96.87 grams of\n\ncocaine   base   and    299.96     grams    of   cocaine,      respectively,    in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1).              Count Three charged García-\n\nCarrasquillo     with    knowingly     possessing       certain    firearms    in\n\nfurtherance of a drug trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§   924(c)(1).     Count    Four    charged      all   three    defendants    with\n\nknowingly using, carrying, and discharging certain firearms in\n\nrelation to a drug trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 924(c)(1)(A)(iii), (C)(i).         Counts Five and Six charged García-\n\nCarrasquillo and González-Rivera, respectively, with being a felon\n\nin possession of certain firearms in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922\n\n(g)(1).   Count Seven charged Claudio-García with being a fugitive\n\nin possession of certain firearms, also in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 922(g)(2).\n\n           The defendants were tried over nine days in March and\n\nApril of 2004.          At the close of the government's case, the\n\ndefendants moved for judgments of acquittal on the ground of\n\ninsufficient evidence; the district court denied the motions.                  The\n\ncourt also denied the defendants' renewed motions for judgment of\n\n\n\n7\n   Cruz-González was also charged in the same indictment, but the\ndistrict court granted his motion to sever prior to trial.\n\n                                      -6-\n\facquittal the following day.    On April 22, 2004, a jury acquitted\n\nall three defendants of Count Four, and also acquitted González-\n\nRivera of Count Six, but found the three defendants guilty on all\n\nother counts as charged.\n\n           On April 5 and 7, 2005, the district court sentenced the\n\nthree defendants.    Only González-Rivera challenges his sentence,\n\nand therefore his is the only sentence we will discuss in detail.8\n\nGonzález-Rivera's presentence report (\"PSR\") calculated an initial\n\nbase offense level of 32 pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1, after\n\nconverting the quantities of cocaine base and cocaine powder into\n\nan equivalent quantity of marijuana using the Drug Equivalency\n\nTable.     The PSR also recommended a two-level enhancement for\n\npossession of a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking offense,\n\nU.S.S.G.   §   2D1.1(b)(1),   and   another   two-level   increase   for\n\n\"recklessly creat[ing] a substantial risk of death or serious\n\nbodily injury to another person in the course of fleeing from a law\n\nenforcement officer,\" id. § 3C1.2.        Utilizing González-Rivera's\n\ncriminal history category of IV, the PSR calculated an advisory\n\nguideline range of 262 to 327 months imprisonment.\n\n\n\n\n8\n   García-Carrasquillo and Claudio-García were each sentenced to\n262 months imprisonment on Count One, 240 months on Count Two, and\n120 months on Counts Five and Seven respectively, to be served\nconcurrently. In addition, García-Carrasquillo was sentenced to\nanother 120 months on Count Three, to be served consecutively to\nthe other terms.\n\n                                    -7-\n\f           González-Rivera objected to the PSR on two grounds: (1)\n\nthat the two recommended enhancements were inapplicable because the\n\njury   acquitted   him   of   all    firearms   charges,   and   therefore\n\napplication of the enhancements would violate his Sixth Amendment\n\nright under Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296 (2004) (requiring\n\nthat facts used to increase a defendant's sentence beyond the\n\nstatutory maximum set by state sentencing guidelines be found by a\n\njury);9 and (2) that if the court applied the two-level increase\n\nfor possession of a firearm, the sentencing guidelines prohibited\n\nimposition of the second two-level enhancement for obstruction of\n\njustice because the same conduct was the basis of both adjustments,\n\nsee U.S.S.G. § 3C1.2 cmt. n.1.\n\n           The government responded by arguing that Blakely did not\n\napply to the federal sentencing guidelines.        The probation officer\n\nalso responded to the defendant's objections, arguing that even\n\nthough González-Rivera had been acquitted of the firearms charges,\n\nthe corresponding enhancement could still be applied pursuant to\n\nU.S.S.G. § 1B1.3 because he aided and abetted others who were\n\nconvicted of possessing firearms during the commission of the same\n\noffense. The probation officer also argued that the obstruction of\n\njustice   enhancement    applied    because   González-Rivera    created   a\n\nsubstantial risk of injury to others in the course of fleeing from\n\n\n9\n    United States v. Booker, extending Blakely to the federal\nsentencing guidelines, had not yet been decided. See 543 U.S. 220,\n243-44 (2005).\n\n                                     -8-\n\fthe police, by acting with the other defendants who were in\n\npossession of firearms.\n\n            At González-Rivera's sentencing hearing, defense counsel\n\nfirst   presented      mitigating       factors,    including   the     terrible\n\ndevastation suffered by González-Rivera when his brother, working\n\nin the United States, shot and killed his work supervisor; and\n\nGonzález-Rivera's dramatic spiritual awakening, evidenced by the\n\nfact that he is now serving as a pastor at his correctional\n\nfacility. González-Rivera's counsel then reiterated his objections\n\nto the PSR, and requested a sentence of 168 months, which was the\n\nlow   end   of   the   168   to   210    months    guidelines   range   without\n\napplication of the two recommended enhancements.\n\n            The government argued that the court should apply the two\n\nenhancements and impose a sentence at the top of the guidelines\n\nrange due to the large amounts of drugs and guns seized and the\n\ndefendant's attempt to flee the scene.             The government also noted\n\nGonzález-Rivera's criminal history, which indicated that he \"lived\n\na life of crime\" from 1996 to 2003, and his lack of a repentant\n\nstatement with respect to the instant crime.\n\n            After hearing the two sides' arguments, the district\n\ncourt imposed a sentence of 210 months imprisonment for each count,\n\nto run concurrently, followed by supervised release for five years\n\n\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fas   to   Count   One   and   three   years   as   to   Count   Two,   to   run\n\nconcurrently.10    The district court explained:\n\n            The Court has considered all the applicable\n            adjustments under the now Advisory Federal\n            Sentencing Guidelines, as well as the other\n            sentencing factors set forth in 18 [U.S.C. §]\n            3553(a), namely the nature and circumstances\n            of the offenses and defendant's history and\n            characteristics, the need to promote respect\n            for the law and provide just punishment in\n            light of the seriousness of the offense,\n            deterrence, the protection of the public from\n            further     crimes     of    the    defendant,\n            rehabilitation,    and   the  need   to  avoid\n            unwarranted    sentence    disparities   among\n            defendants with similar records who have been\n            found guilty of similar conduct.\n\n\n                    II. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n            García-Carrasquillo and Claudio-García both appeal their\n\nconvictions on the ground that there was insufficient evidence\n\nlinking them to the drugs and paraphernalia found in the house from\n\nwhich they fled before being arrested.             See Fed. R. Crim. P. 29\n\n(\"[T]he court on the defendant's motion must enter a judgment of\n\nacquittal of any offense for which the evidence is insufficient to\n\nsustain a conviction.\").        We review sufficiency of the evidence\n\nchallenges de novo, affirming the conviction if, after viewing all\n\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the government and\n\nindulging all reasonable inferences in the government's favor, a\n\n\n\n10\n   The district court also imposed various conditions, not relevant\nhere, as well as a special monetary assessment of $200 as required\nby law.\n\n                                      -10-\n\frational factfinder could conclude that the prosecution proved all\n\nelements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.                 United States v.\n\nBoulerice, 325 F.3d 75, 79 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n            In order to prove possession with intent to distribute,\n\nthe    government    must    show   that    the   defendants      knowingly     and\n\nintentionally     possessed,     either     actually     or   constructively,     a\n\ncontrolled      substance    with   the    specific     intent    to   distribute.\n\nUnited States v. López-López, 282 F.3d 1, 19 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n\"Constructive possession exists when a person knowingly has the\n\npower and intention at a given time to exercise dominion and\n\ncontrol over an object either directly or through others.\"                  United\n\nStates v. McLean, 409 F.3d 492, 501 (1st Cir. 2005) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).           While mere presence on the property,\n\nproximity to the drugs, or association with the possessor is not\n\nsufficient, United States v. Barnes, 890 F.2d 545, 549 (1st Cir.\n\n1989), the government may rely entirely on circumstantial evidence\n\nto show constructive possession.            United States v. Echeverri, 982\n\nF.2d 675, 678 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"The attendant circumstances tell\n\nthe tale[,] and the culpability of a defendant's presence hinges\n\nupon    whether     the     circumstances     fairly      imply    participatory\n\ninvolvement.\").\n\n            In order to prove aiding and abetting, the government\n\nmust    first    establish    the   commission     of    the     offense   by   the\n\nprincipal, and then prove that \"the defendant consciously shared\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fthe principal's knowledge of the underlying criminal act, and\n\nintended to help the principal.\"         United States v. Henderson, 320\n\nF.3d 92, 109 (1st Cir. 2003); see also United States v. Rodríguez-\n\nAlvarado, 985 F.2d 15, 17-18 (1st Cir. 1993) (requiring that the\n\ngovernment show \"that the defendant associated himself with the\n\ncommission of the offense, participated in it as something that he\n\nwished to bring about, and sought by his actions to make it\n\nsucceed\").    Again, mere association with the principal or presence\n\nat the scene of the crime is insufficient, even with knowledge that\n\nthe crime is to be committed.           United States v. Hyson, 721 F.2d\n\n856, 862 (1st Cir. 1983).\n\n           We can quickly dispose of García-Carrasquillo's claim\n\nthat there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for\n\npossession.    The day after the defendants were arrested, they were\n\ntaken before a state magistrate judge for a probable cause hearing.\n\nAlthough   there   was   no   written    record   of   that   hearing,   Agent\n\nValentín testified at trial that after the magistrate advised the\n\ndefendants of their right to remain silent, García-Carrasquillo\n\nvoluntarily admitted that all the weapons and drugs seized from the\n\n\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fhouse were his.11   His admission is unquestionably sufficient to\n\nsupport his conviction.12\n\n          The sufficiency of the evidence against Claudio-García is\n\na much closer question.     He argues that there was insufficient\n\nevidence of his constructive possession because there was no\n\nevidence that he had dominion or control over the drugs.          He also\n\nchallenges the sufficiency of the evidence of aiding and abetting,\n\narguing that there was no evidence that he willfully intended to\n\nhelp García-Carrasquillo in the crime of possession with intent to\n\ndistribute.   Claudio-García asserts that the evidence proves, at\n\nmost, that he was merely present at the scene.\n\n          Having affirmed the sufficiency of the evidence that\n\nGarcía-Carrasquillo   was   the   principal,   we   need   only   satisfy\n\nourselves that there was evidence presented from which a rational\n\njuror could infer that Claudio-García intended to aid García-\n\n\n\n11\n     At trial, García-Carrasquillo's attorney objected to the\nadmission of Agent Valentín's testimony regarding García-\nCarrasquillo's alleged admission, on the ground that the testimony\nrequired \"independent corroboration,\" but the district court judge\noverruled the objection. García-Carrasquillo does not appeal the\nadmission of the evidence.\n12\n   García-Carrasquillo does not challenge the sufficiency of the\nevidence as to other elements of the crime, particularly the\nspecific intent to distribute the drugs. Nonetheless, we find that\nthe large amount and individual packaging of the drugs otherwise\nsupports a conviction under 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1).      See United\nStates v. Latham, 874 F.2d 852, 862-63 (1st Cir. 1989) (collecting\ncases supporting the proposition that \"possession of large\nquantities of drugs justifies the inference that the drugs are for\ndistribution\").\n\n                                  -13-\n\fCarrasquillo in his crime of possession with intent to distribute.\n\nIf the government successfully proves aiding and abetting, it does\n\nnot   need    to   prove   that   Claudio-García       himself   actually   or\n\nconstructively possessed the drugs, since either theory of guilt\n\nalone would sustain his conviction. See 18 U.S.C. § 2(a) (\"Whoever\n\ncommits an offense against the United States or aids, abets,\n\ncounsels,     commands,    induces   or     procures    its   commission,   is\n\npunishable as a principal.\"); see also United States v. Fuller, 768\n\nF.2d 343, 346 (1st Cir. 1985) (\"[W]e find the evidence presented\n\nwas more than sufficient to support the jury's verdict based on\n\neither theory, aiding and abetting or constructive possession.\").\n\n             The evidence fairly demonstrates that Claudio-García was\n\nin hiding with his uncle, García-Carrasquillo, and traveled with\n\nhim in a stolen car to the house where García-Carrasquillo kept a\n\nlarge quantity of individually packaged drugs; that he remained in\n\nthe apartment with his uncle and the drugs for a couple of hours\n\nbefore the SWAT team arrived;13 and that he then attempted to flee\n\nfrom the police, exchanging gunfire with them when they pursued.\n\nFrom this evidence, a rational juror could reasonably infer that\n\nClaudio-García accompanied his uncle to the house filled with drugs\n\n\n\n13\n   Claudio-García asserts that there was no evidence that he was\nin the apartment because the agents could not see the door to the\napartment from their vantage point. Even if that were so, the jury\ncould infer that the defendants were in the apartment based on the\nundisputed testimony that the defendants were seen entering and\nleaving the carport where the door to the apartment was located.\n\n                                     -14-\n\fbecause García-Carrasquillo trusted his nephew enough to enlist his\n\nhelp in committing the crime charged. Cf. United States v. Rincón,\n\n180 F. App'x 376, 379 (3d Cir. 2006) (allowing inference that drug\n\ndealer trusted defendant based on evidence that dealer left drugs\n\nwith defendant, in part to support conviction for aiding and\n\nabetting in drug sale). The jury could further infer that Claudio-\n\nGarcía was in fact so aiding his uncle, especially given that he\n\nknowingly ran from and shot at the police when they attempted to\n\napprehend them.   See López-López, 282 F.3d at 21 (\"[The defendant]\n\nran when he saw the police and hid in a field, which suggests\n\nawareness of guilt.\").\n\n            Claudio-García   correctly     points   out   that   there   is\n\nanother, more plausible explanation for his presence at the scene\n\nand his attempt to flee: He was an armed fugitive in hiding with a\n\nwanted family member, and he ran in order to avoid capture by the\n\npolice.    While this could be true, the government need not exclude\n\nevery possible explanation.      See United States v. Ortiz, 447 F.3d\n\n28,   33   (1st   Cir.   2006)   (\"[T]he    possibility    of    innocuous\n\nexplanations for [a defendant's] behavior does not foreclose the\n\njury's contrary inferences.\").       Hence, there was sufficient --\n\nalbeit circumstantial and not particularly strong -- evidence that\n\nClaudio-García's presence at the scene and association with his\n\nuncle were not just \"mere\" presence and association, see Echeverri,\n\n982 F.2d at 678 (\"[A] defendant's 'mere presence' argument will\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\ffail in situations where the 'mere' is lacking.\"), but rather that\n\nhe was a culpable participant in García-Carrasquillo's crime of\n\npossession with intent to distribute, see United States v. Lema,\n\n909 F.2d 561, 570 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"[P]resence on a single occasion\n\nmay support a conviction for aiding and abetting if the surrounding\n\ncircumstances lead to a reasonable inference that the defendant\n\nmust have been a knowing participant.\"). Therefore, we must affirm\n\nClaudio-García's conviction as well.\n\n                 III. González-Rivera's Sentence\n\n          González-Rivera makes three claims of error with respect\n\nto his sentence: (1) that the district court failed to adequately\n\nexplain the reasons for choosing the sentence imposed; (2) that the\n\ndistrict court violated his Fourteenth Amendment right to equal\n\nprotection when it applied the disparate equivalency ratio between\n\ncrack and powder cocaine;14 and (3) that the sentence violates his\n\nFifth Amendment right to due process and the Eighth Amendment\n\nprohibition on cruel and unusual punishment because it is based on\n\nthe crack to powder cocaine disparity.        We review these legal\n\nchallenges de novo.     United States v. Rivera, 448 F.3d 82, 84 (1st\n\nCir. 2006).   If an issue is not raised below, however, we review\n\nonly for plain error.    United States v. Carvell, 74 F.3d 8, 14 (1st\n\nCir. 1996).\n\n\n14\n   We assume that he meant this as a Fifth Amendment challenge,\nsince the Fourteenth Amendment applies only to the states. See\nBolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 498-99 (1954).\n\n                                 -16-\n\fA. Explanation for Sentence Imposed\n\n           In United States v. Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 518-19\n\n(1st Cir. 2006) (en banc), we outlined the appropriate post-Booker\n\napproach to sentencing under the federal guidelines to aid us in\n\nreviewing the reasonableness of a sentence.          We directed trial\n\ncourts to engage in a \"sequential determination of the guideline\n\nrange, including any proposed departures, followed by the further\n\ndetermination whether other factors identified by either side\n\nwarrant an ultimate sentence above or below the guideline range.\"\n\nId.   An important prerequisite to our reasonableness analysis is\n\nthe district court's reasoned explanation for the sentence imposed,\n\nas required by 18 U.S.C. § 3553(c).    Id. at 519.    This is true even\n\nif the sentence is within the guidelines range.      See United States\n\nv. Turbides-Leonardo, 468 F.3d 34, 40-41 (1st Cir. 2006).      We are,\n\nhowever, prepared to read a district court's less-than-explicit\n\nexplanation in light of the record.       United States v. Navedo-\n\nConcepción, 450 F.3d 54, 57 (1st Cir. 2006).   \"The more obvious the\n\nreasons for a [sentencing] choice, the less that needs to be\n\nexplained.\"   Id.\n\n           Although at times we have been willing to go to great\n\nlengths to infer the district court's reasoning from the record,\n\n\"there are limits.\"   United States v. Gilman, No. 06-1376, 2007 WL\n\n686648, at *4 (1st Cir. Mar. 8, 2007).      This case exceeds those\n\nlimits.   The district judge gave a one-sentence explanation of her\n\n\n                                -17-\n\fchoice   of    sentence,     which    conclusorily       stated   that   she   had\n\nconsidered the appropriate adjustments and the § 3553(a) factors.\n\nShe did not explain her guidelines calculation, nor did she include\n\nany reasoned analysis or reference any evidence that influenced her\n\ndecision.     She merely stated the sentence and paraphrased three of\n\nthe seven enumerated factors, which she apparently considered\n\nimportant.\n\n              Furthermore,    we     are   unable   to   discern   the   court's\n\nreasoning by looking to the record of the parties' arguments.                  The\n\ngovernment argued for a sentence at the top of the guidelines range\n\nconsidering two enhancements, whereas the defendant requested a\n\nsentence at the bottom of the range without the enhancements,\n\nciting mitigating factors.            The district judge did not explain\n\nwhether she applied one or both recommended enhancements, what the\n\napplicable guidelines range was, whether she thought the defendant\n\ndeserved a sentence at any point within a particular range, or\n\nwhether she was influenced by either sides' arguments enough to\n\ndepart from one of the two ranges under consideration.\n\n              Consequently, this case differs from other cases in which\n\nwe were able to understand with a modicum of certitude the reasons\n\nbehind the district court's choice of sentence by reviewing the\n\nsentencing record. See, e.g., United States v. Vázquez-Rivera, 470\n\nF.3d 443, 448 (1st Cir. 2006) (affirming a sentence where the judge\n\nmade clear findings on the record, referenced the sentencing\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\ffactors, and made an explicit statement of the factual basis of the\n\nsentence); Navedo-Concepción, 450 F.3d at 57-58 (\"In this case, the\n\ndistrict court's explicit concerns were the scope of the crime and\n\nthe potential for dangerousness.           Beyond that, the district court\n\nreferred generally to 'the evidence presented during the trial' as\n\njustifying    'a    sentence    at   the    upper       end    of   the    advisory\n\nguidelines.'\"); United States v. Scherrer, 444 F.3d 91, 94 (1st\n\nCir. 2006) (\"Taken at face value, these [mitigating] factors do at\n\nfirst seem to have weight; but the government gave some effective\n\nanswers in the district court and it is fair to infer that the\n\ndistrict court found them persuasive.             That the district court did\n\nnot elaborate on them--it said only that it took them into account-\n\n-does not preclude the inference where the record explains it.\");\n\nUnited States v. Alli, 444 F.3d 34, 41 (1st Cir. 2006) (\"[Where the\n\ndistrict court] simply stated, '[T]his is one of those cases . . .\n\nwhere I think the guidelines produce a sentence that is reasonable\n\nand   perfectly    consistent   with     the   factors        enumerated    in   the\n\nstatute, 3553(a),' . . . we do not fault the judge for not speaking\n\nfurther about the § 3553(a) factors, given that none were raised\n\nfor his consideration and, in his independent judgment, none were\n\nworthy of further discussion.\" (second and third alterations in\n\noriginal)).\n\n           The     government   argues     that    it    is    obvious    that   the\n\ndistrict court chose not to apply the two recommended enhancements\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\fand that it then adopted the government's arguments for a sentence\n\nat the top of the resultant guidelines range.              While this is\n\ncertainly a plausible reading of the record, even if it were true,\n\nthe district court's explanation would be insufficient as a matter\n\nof law.     Section 3553(c)(1) requires that the trial judge identify\n\nits reason for selecting a sentence at a particular point within a\n\nrange exceeding twenty-four months. See Gilman, 2007 WL 686648, at\n\n*5 (\"[T]he statement here does not identify the reason that the\n\ndistrict court imposed a sentence in the middle of the guideline\n\nrange rather than elsewhere within that range (which spans more\n\nthan 24 months), in direct violation of Section 3553(c)(1).\").            If\n\nthe court below rejected the enhancements, which is by no means\n\nclear, the guidelines range of 168 to 210 months would exceed\n\ntwenty-four months, and the court would have to explain why it\n\nchose the top of the range.\n\n             Because the court did not even approximate our Jiménez-\n\nBeltre approach nor provide any reasoned explanation for its\n\ndetermination, we will not infer several degrees of reasoning,\n\nincluding a specific explanation explicitly required by law, and\n\nguess what the district court was thinking.          Therefore, on this\n\nground,15    we   vacate   González-Rivera's   sentence   and   remand   for\n\n\n15\n    To be clear, we reject any defense argument that we cannot\nuphold a reasonable sentence if the district court does not make an\nexplicit statement of its reasons on the record. Our precedent is\nexceedingly clear that we can look to the record to clarify the\njudge's reasoning. That said, district court judges would do well\n\n                                    -20-\n\fresentencing consistent with this opinion and prior precedent. Id.\n\nat *4 (\"[I]f we are in fact unable to discern from the record the\n\nreasoning behind the district court's sentence, appellate review is\n\nfrustrated and 'it is incumbent upon us to vacate . . .' the\n\ndecision below to provide the district court an opportunity to\n\nexplain its reasoning at resentencing.\").\n\nB. Crack and Powder Cocaine Equivalency Ratios\n\n            The remainder of González-Rivera's arguments, none of\n\nwhich he raised below, involve the 100:1 equivalency ratio of crack\n\nto powder cocaine used to calculate his sentence.                 See United\n\nStates v. Pho, 433 F.3d 53, 54-57 (1st Cir. 2006) (describing \"the\n\nhistory of the disparate treatment of crack and powdered cocaine\n\nembedded in the federal sentencing guidelines (commonly referred to\n\nas   the   100:1   ratio)\").   In    1994,   we    upheld   the   sentencing\n\ndistinction between crack and powder cocaine against both due\n\nprocess and equal protection challenges under the Fifth Amendment.\n\nUnited States v. Singleterry, 29 F.3d 733, 740-41 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\nWe said that Congress had sufficient reasons for treating crack\n\nmore harshly than powder cocaine, and that \"there are racially\n\nneutral grounds for the classification that more plausibly explain\n\nits [disparate] impact on [minorities].\"          Id.   (internal quotation\n\nmarks and alteration omitted). González-Rivera offers no arguments\n\n\nto make the sentencing process as transparent as possible, to avoid\nthe possibility of remand on appeal. See Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d\nat 521 (Torruella, J., concurring).\n\n                                    -21-\n\fthat we have not consistently rejected before, see Pho, 433 F.3d at\n\n61-65   (rejecting     a   variety     of   arguments     against   the   ratio,\n\nincluding those based on the Sentencing Commission's effort to ease\n\nthe discrepancy), and even so, based on our clear precedent, there\n\nwas obviously no plain error on the part of the district court in\n\napplying the equivalency ratios.\n\n              González-Rivera also challenges the equivalency ratio as\n\nso disproportional as to be unconstitutional under the Eighth\n\nAmendment.     The First Circuit has not squarely decided this issue,\n\nbut   every    other   circuit   has    rejected    the    argument   that   the\n\nsentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine constitutes\n\ncruel and unusual punishment.           See United States v. Brooks, 161\n\nF.3d 1240, 1247 (10th Cir. 1998); United States v. Brazel, 102 F.3d\n\n1120, 1158 (11th Cir. 1997); United States v. Fraiser, No. 94-\n\n30287, 1995 WL 528004, at *1 (9th Cir. 1995) (unpublished opinion)\n\n(citing United States v. Harding, 971 F.2d 410, 414 (9th Cir.\n\n1992));   United States v. Jackson, 59 F.3d 1421, 1424 (2d Cir.\n\n1995); United States v. Smith, 34 F.3d 514, 525 (7th Cir. 1994);\n\nUnited States v. Fisher, 22 F.3d 574, 580 (5th Cir. 1994);                United\n\nStates v. Frazier, 981 F.2d 92, 96 (3d Cir. 1992); United States v.\n\nLevy, 904 F.2d 1026, 1034 (6th Cir. 1990);                  United States v.\n\nThomas, 900 F.2d 37, 39 (4th Cir. 1990); United States v. Buckner,\n\n894 F.2d 975, 980-81 (8th Cir. 1990); United States v. Cyrus, 890\n\nF.2d 1245, 1248 (D.C. Cir. 1989).             Moreover, we have stated many\n\n\n                                       -22-\n\ftimes before that \"[t]he decision to employ a 100:1 crack-to-powder\n\nratio . . . is a policy judgment, pure and simple,\" and therefore\n\nit is up to Congress -- not the courts -- to adopt rational drug\n\nequivalency ratios.       Pho, 433 F.3d at 62-63.\n\n           Although     this    is    enough    to    defeat    González-Rivera's\n\nargument under a plain error standard, we also point out that a\n\ndefendant seeking proportionality review under the Eighth Amendment\n\nmust \"demonstrate, at the threshold, an 'initial inference of gross\n\ndisproportionality' between the 'gravity of [the] criminal conduct\n\nand the severity of the . . . penalty' imposed.\"                 United States v.\n\nCardoza,   129   F.3d   6,     18    (1st.   Cir.     1997)    (internal   citation\n\nomitted) (alterations in original).              We have previously upheld a\n\n280-month sentence for the distribution of 85.3 grams of crack\n\ncocaine against an Eighth Amendment challenge.                   United States v.\n\nGraciani, 61 F.3d 70, 76-77 (1st Cir. 1995).                      Here, González-\n\nRivera's   sentence     was    seventy       months    less    for   a   conviction\n\ninvolving over ten grams more crack.                 We therefore cannot infer\n\ngross disproportionality in this case.\n\n                                IV. Conclusion\n\n           For    the     foregoing          reasons,     we     affirm    García-\n\nCarrasquillo's and Claudio-García's convictions, and we vacate\n\nGonzález-Rivera's sentence and remand for resentencing.\n\n           Affirmed in part, vacated and remanded in part.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -23-\n\f",

Background</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Scene of the Crime</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 9, 2003, at approximately 5:45 p.m., Agents H&#233;ctor Valent&#237;n and Nelson Gonz&#225;lez-Rodr&#237;guez of the Puerto Rico Police Department's Special Arrests and Extraditions Division established surveillance of a residence in the R&#237;o Grande area of northeastern Puerto Rico, in relation to two local felony arrest warrants for Garc&#237;a-Carrasquillo and a fugitive arrest warrant for Claudio-Garc&#237;a.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The split-level house consisted of the main residence on the upper level, and a small ground-level apartment accessed by a door under a carport at the front of the house. The carport stood over a driveway that led to a gate and then out to the road in front of the house. The agents parked their unmarked car on the road approximately 100 meters up a hill from the house, where they could observe activity around the house with binoculars. From their vantage point, they could see a Ford Bronco parked under the carport at the front of the house. They could not see the door to the ground-level apartment located behind the Bronco, nor could they see a short staircase on the left side of the carport.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> They could, however, see the staircase leading to the main entrance on the upper level of the house.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Around two hours later, a stolen Mazda Proteg&#233;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> pulled up and parked on the road in front of the house, outside a gate across the driveway. Garc&#237;a-Carrasquillo and Claudio-Garc&#237;a exited the vehicle and entered the carport, presumably to enter the ground-level apartment at the rear of the carport, though it is unclear whether the agents actually saw the men enter, or later exit, through the door to the apartment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Fifteen minutes later, Garc&#237;a-Carrasquillo walked out from under the carport carrying an assault rifle, which he placed in the trunk of the Mazda Proteg&#233;. He then returned to the carport.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this point, the agents notified their supervisor, Lieutenant Herminio D&#237;az, of the situation. Lieutenant D&#237;az mobilized the SWAT team and posted two agents, Jos&#233; Nev&#225;rez Ortiz and Richard Carrera, at the back of the house. As the SWAT team approached the house, Jos&#233; David Cruz-Gonz&#225;lez, the owner of the house, who was somewhere outside the gate across the driveway in front of the house,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> ran through the gate toward the house shouting that the police were there. The three co-defendants in the case, Garc&#237;a-Carrasquillo, Claudio-Garc&#237;a, and Gonz&#225;lez-Rivera, then ran out of the ground-level apartment and joined Cruz-Gonz&#225;lez in fleeing towards the back of the house.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the back of the house, the four men jumped over a fence and continued to run. Agent Nev&#225;rez shouted for the men to stop and told them they were under arrest. The fleeing men and the officers then exchanged gunfire; Gonz&#225;lez-Rivera was shot in the leg. The men continued to run and exchange gunfire with the pursuing police until the four men fell into a large hole in the ground,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> where they were apprehended and arrested. The three co-defendants were each found with loaded firearms on their persons; however, no drugs or paraphernalia were found on any of the defendants at the time of their arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, back at the house, the SWAT team, Lieutenant D&#237;az, and Agent Valent&#237;n searched the ground-level apartment, where they found a large amount of cocaine and cocaine base (crack cocaine), a small amount of marijuana, and assorted drug paraphernalia, including a stove for cooking crack cocaine and items used to break up cocaine rocks. The cocaine base was packaged in approximately 972 vials, which were placed in plastic bags labeled by drug distribution point. The Mazda Proteg&#233; was taken to the police station after the arrest; when the police opened the trunk, they found an AR-15 rifle along with the AK-47 that the agents had seen Garc&#237;a-Carrasquillo put there during their surveillance. The police did not take any fingerprints from the drugs, paraphernalia, or firearms recovered from the apartment or the vehicle, nor from the firearms found on the defendants at the time of their arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Legal Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 10, 2003, the defendants were taken before a local magistrate judge for a probable cause hearing. After the judge advised the defendants of their right to remain silent, Garc&#237;a-Carrasquillo voluntarily disclosed that all of the drugs and firearms seized the previous day belonged to him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 17, 2003, a grand jury returned a seven-count Superseding Indictment against the defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Counts One and Two charged that all three defendants, aiding and abetting each other, knowingly possessed with the intent to distribute 96.87 grams of cocaine base and 299.96 grams of cocaine, respectively, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1). Count Three charged Garc&#237;a-Carrasquillo with knowingly possessing certain firearms in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1). Count Four charged all three defendants with knowingly using, carrying, and discharging certain firearms in relation to a drug trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(A)(iii), (C)(i). Counts Five and Six charged Garc&#237;a-Carrasquillo and Gonz&#225;lez-Rivera, respectively, with being a felon in possession of certain firearms in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1). Count Seven charged Claudio-Garc&#237;a with being a fugitive in possession of certain firearms, also in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants were tried over nine days in March and April of 2004. At the close of the government's case, the defendants moved for judgments of acquittal on the ground of insufficient evidence; the district court denied the motions. The court also denied the defendants' renewed motions for judgment of acquittal the following day. On April 22, 2004, a jury acquitted all three defendants of Count Four, and also acquitted Gonz&#225;lez-Rivera of Count Six, but found the three defendants guilty on all other counts as charged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 5 and 7, 2005, the district court sentenced the three defendants. Only Gonz&#225;lez-Rivera challenges his sentence, and therefore his is the only sentence we will discuss in detail.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Gonz&#225;lez-Rivera's presentence report (\"PSR\") calculated an initial base offense level of 32 pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1, after converting the quantities of cocaine base and cocaine powder into an equivalent quantity of marijuana using the Drug Equivalency Table. The PSR also recommended a two-level enhancement for possession of a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking offense, U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1), and another two-level increase for \"recklessly creat[ing] a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person in the course of fleeing from a law enforcement officer,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 3C1.2. Utilizing Gonz&#225;lez-Rivera's criminal history category of IV, the PSR calculated an advisory guideline range of 262 to 327 months imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonz&#225;lez-Rivera objected to the PSR on two grounds: (1) that the two recommended enhancements were inapplicable because the jury acquitted him of all firearms charges, and therefore application of the enhancements would violate his Sixth Amendment right under <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) (requiring that facts used to increase a defendant's sentence beyond the statutory maximum set by state sentencing guidelines be found by a jury);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> and (2) that if the court applied the two-level increase for possession of a firearm, the sentencing guidelines prohibited imposition of the second two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice because the same conduct was the basis of both adjustments, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.2 cmt. n. 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government responded by arguing that <i>Blakely</i> did not apply to the federal sentencing guidelines. The probation officer also responded to the defendant's objections, arguing that even though Gonz&#225;lez-Rivera had been acquitted of the firearms charges, the corresponding enhancement could still be applied pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3 because he aided and abetted others who were convicted of possessing firearms during the commission of the same offense. The probation officer also argued that the obstruction of justice enhancement applied because Gonz&#225;lez-Rivera created a substantial risk of injury to others in the course of fleeing from the police, by acting with the other defendants who were in possession of firearms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At Gonz&#225;lez-Rivera's sentencing hearing, defense counsel first presented mitigating factors, including the terrible devastation suffered by Gonz&#225;lez-Rivera when his brother, working in the United States, shot and killed his work supervisor; and Gonz&#225;lez-Rivera's dramatic spiritual awakening, evidenced by the fact that he is now serving as a pastor at his correctional facility. Gonz&#225;lez-Rivera's counsel then reiterated his objections to the PSR, and requested a sentence of 168 months, which was the low end of the 168 to 210 months guidelines range without application of the two recommended enhancements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argued that the court should apply the two enhancements and impose a sentence at the top of the guidelines range due to the large amounts of drugs and guns seized and the defendant's attempt to flee the scene. The government also noted Gonz&#225;lez-Rivera's criminal history, which indicated that he \"lived a life of crime\" from 1996 to 2003, and his lack of a repentant statement with respect to the instant crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After hearing the two sides' arguments, the district court imposed a sentence of 210 months imprisonment for each count, to run concurrently, followed by supervised release for five years as to Count One and three years as to Count Two, to run concurrently.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> The district court explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court has considered all the applicable adjustments under the now Advisory Federal Sentencing Guidelines, as well as the other sentencing factors set forth in 18 [U.S.C. &#167; ] 3553(a), namely the nature and circumstances of the offenses and defendant's history and characteristics, the need to promote respect for the law and provide just punishment in light of the seriousness of the offense, deterrence, the protection of the public from further crimes of the defendant, rehabilitation, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Garc&#237;a-Carrasquillo and Claudio-Garc&#237;a both appeal their convictions on the ground that there was insufficient evidence linking them to the drugs and paraphernalia found in the house from which they fled before being arrested. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 29 (\"[T]he court on the defendant's motion must enter a judgment of acquittal of any offense for which the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction.\"). We review sufficiency of the evidence challenges <i>de novo,</i> affirming the conviction if, after viewing all the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and indulging all reasonable inferences in the government's favor, a rational factfinder could conclude that the prosecution proved all elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>United States v. Boulerice,</i> 325 F.3d 75, 79 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to prove possession with intent to distribute, the government must show that the defendants knowingly and intentionally possessed, either actually or constructively, a controlled substance with the specific intent to distribute. <i>United States v. L&#243;pez-L&#243;pez,</i> 282 F.3d 1, 19 (1st Cir.2002). \"Constructive possession exists when a person knowingly has the power and intention at a given time to exercise dominion and control over an object either directly or through others.\" <i>United States v. McLean,</i> 409 F.3d 492, 501 (1st Cir. 2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). While mere presence on the property, proximity to the drugs, or association with the possessor is not sufficient, <i>United States v. Barnes,</i> 890 F.2d 545, 549 (1st Cir.1989), the government may rely entirely on circumstantial evidence to show constructive possession. <i>United States v. Echeverri,</i> 982 F.2d 675, 678 (1st Cir.1993) (\"The attendant circumstances tell the tale[,] and the culpability of a defendant's presence hinges upon whether the circumstances fairly imply participatory involvement.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to prove aiding and abetting, the government must first establish the commission of the offense by the principal, and then prove that \"the defendant consciously shared the principal's knowledge of the underlying criminal act, and intended to help the principal.\" <i>United States v. Henderson,</i> 320 F.3d 92, 109 (1st Cir.2003); <i>see also United States v. Rodr&#237;guez Alvarado,</i> 985 F.2d 15, 17-18 (1st Cir.1993) (requiring that the government show \"that the defendant associated himself with the commission of the offense, participated in it as something that he wished to bring about, and sought by his actions to make it succeed\"). Again, mere association with the principal or presence at the scene of the crime is insufficient, even with knowledge that the crime is to be committed. <i>United States v. Hyson,</i> 721 F.2d 856, 862 (1st Cir.1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We can quickly dispose of Garc&#237;a-Carrasquillo's claim that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for possession. The day after the defendants were arrested, they were taken before a state magistrate judge for a probable cause hearing. Although there was no written record of that hearing, Agent Valent&#237;n testified at trial that after the magistrate advised the defendants of their right to remain silent, Garc&#237;a-Carrasquillo voluntarily admitted that all the weapons and drugs seized from the house were his.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> His admission is unquestionably sufficient to support his conviction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sufficiency of the evidence against Claudio-Garc&#237;a is a much closer question. He argues that there was insufficient evidence of his constructive possession because there was no evidence that he had dominion or control over the drugs. He also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence of aiding and abetting, arguing that there was no evidence that he willfully intended to help Garc&#237;a-Carrasquillo in the crime of possession with intent to distribute. Claudio-Garc&#237;a asserts that the evidence proves, at most, that he was merely present at the scene.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having affirmed the sufficiency of the evidence that Garc&#237;a-Carrasquillo was the principal, we need only satisfy ourselves that there was evidence presented from which a rational juror could infer that Claudio-Garc&#237;a intended to aid Garc&#237;a-Carrasquillo in his crime of possession with intent to distribute. If the government successfully proves aiding and abetting, it does not need to prove that Claudio-Garc&#237;a himself actually or constructively possessed the drugs, since either theory of guilt alone would sustain his conviction. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2(a) (\"Whoever commits an offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission, is punishable as a principal.\"); <i>see also United States v. Fuller,</i> 768 F.2d 343, 346 (1st Cir.1985) (\"[W]e find the evidence presented was more than sufficient to support the jury's verdict based on either theory, aiding and abetting or constructive possession.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence fairly demonstrates that Claudio-Garc&#237;a was in hiding with his uncle, Garc&#237;a-Carrasquillo, and traveled with him in a stolen car to the house where Garc&#237;a-Carrasquillo kept a large quantity of individually packaged drugs; that he remained in the apartment with his uncle and the drugs for a couple of hours before the SWAT team arrived;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> and that he then attempted to flee from the police, exchanging gunfire with them when they pursued. From this evidence, a rational juror could reasonably infer that Claudio-Garc&#237;a accompanied his uncle to the house filled with drugs because Garc&#237;a-Carrasquillo trusted his nephew enough to enlist his help in committing the crime charged. <i>Cf. United States v. Rinc&#243;n,</i> 180 Fed.Appx. 376, 379 (3d Cir.2006) (allowing inference that drug dealer trusted defendant based on evidence that dealer left drugs with defendant, in part to support conviction for aiding and abetting in drug sale). The jury could further infer that Claudio-Garc&#237;a was in fact so aiding his uncle, especially given that he knowingly ran from and shot at the police when they attempted to apprehend them. <i>See L&#243;pez-L&#243;pez,</i> 282 F.3d at 21 (\"[The defendant] ran when he saw the police and hid in a field, which suggests awareness of guilt.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claudio-Garc&#237;a correctly points out that there is another, more plausible explanation for his presence at the scene and his attempt to flee: He was an armed fugitive in hiding with a wanted family member, and he ran in order to avoid capture by the police. While this could be true, the government need not exclude every possible explanation. <i>See United States v. Ortiz,</i> 447 F.3d 28, 33 (1st Cir.2006) (\"[T]he possibility of innocuous explanations for [a defendant's] behavior does not foreclose the jury's contrary inferences.\"). Hence, there was sufficient&#8212;albeit circumstantial and not particularly strong&#8212;evidence that Claudio-Garc&#237;a's presence at the scene and association with his uncle were not just \"mere\" presence and association, <i>see Echeverri,</i> 982 F.2d at 678 (\"[A] defendant's `mere presence' argument will fail in situations where the `mere' is lacking.\"), but rather that he was a culpable participant in Garc&#237;a-Carrasquillo's crime of possession with intent to distribute, <i>see United States v. Lema,</i> 909 F.2d 561, 570 (1st Cir.1990) (\"[P]resence on a single occasion may support a conviction for aiding and abetting if the surrounding circumstances lead to a reasonable inference that the defendant must have been a knowing participant.\"). Therefore, we must affirm Claudio-Garc&#237;a's conviction as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Gonz&#225;lez-Rivera's Sentence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonz&#225;lez-Rivera makes three claims of error with respect to his sentence: (1) that the district court failed to adequately explain the reasons for choosing the sentence imposed; (2) that the district court violated his Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection when it applied the disparate equivalency ratio between crack and powder cocaine;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> and (3) that the sentence violates his Fifth Amendment right to due process and the Eighth Amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment because it is based on the crack to powder cocaine disparity. We review these legal challenges <i>de novo. United States v. Rivera,</i> 448 F.3d 82, 84 (1st Cir.2006). If an issue is not raised below, however, we review only for plain error. <i>United States v. Carvell,</i> 74 F.3d 8, 14 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Explanation for Sentence Imposed</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>United States v. Jim&#233;nez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d 514, 518-19 (1st Cir.2006) (en banc), we outlined the appropriate post-<i>Booker</i> approach to sentencing under the federal guidelines to aid us in reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence. We directed trial courts to engage in a \"sequential determination of the guideline range, including any proposed departures, followed by the further determination whether other factors identified by either side warrant an ultimate sentence above or below the guideline range.\" <i>Id.</i> An important prerequisite to our reasonableness analysis is the district court's reasoned explanation for the sentence imposed, as required by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(c). <i>Id.</i> at 519. This is true even if the sentence is within the guidelines range. <i>See United States v. Turbides-Leonardo,</i> 468 F.3d 34, 40-41 (1st Cir.2006). We are, however, prepared to read a district court's less-than-explicit explanation in light of the record. <i>United States v. Navedo-Concepci&#243;n,</i> 450 F.3d 54, 57 (1st Cir.2006). \"The more obvious the reasons for a [sentencing] choice, the less that needs to be explained.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although at times we have been willing to go to great lengths to infer the district court's reasoning from the record, \"there are limits.\" <i>United States v. Gilman,</i> 478 F.3d 440, 446-47 (1st Cir.2007). This case exceeds those limits. The district judge gave a one-sentence explanation of her choice of sentence, which conclusorily stated that she had considered the appropriate adjustments and the &#167; 3553(a) factors. She did not explain her guidelines calculation, nor did she include any reasoned analysis or reference any evidence that influenced her decision. She merely stated the sentence and paraphrased three of the seven enumerated factors, which she apparently considered important.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, we are unable to discern the court's reasoning by looking to the record of the parties' arguments. The government argued for a sentence at the top of the guidelines range considering two enhancements, whereas the defendant requested a sentence at the bottom of the range without the enhancements, citing mitigating factors. The district judge did not explain whether she applied one or both recommended enhancements, what the applicable guidelines range was, whether she thought the defendant deserved a sentence at any point within a particular range, or whether she was influenced by either sides' arguments enough to depart from one of the two ranges under consideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consequently, this case differs from other cases in which we were able to understand with a modicum of certitude the reasons behind the district court's choice of sentence by reviewing the sentencing record. <i>See, e.g., United States v. V&#225;zquez-Rivera,</i> 470 F.3d 443, 448 (1st Cir.2006) (affirming a sentence where the judge made clear findings on the record, referenced the sentencing factors, and made an explicit statement of the factual basis of the sentence); <i>Navedo-Concepci&#243;n,</i> 450 F.3d at 57-58 (\"In this case, the district court's explicit concerns were the scope of the crime and the potential for dangerousness. Beyond that, the district court referred generally to the evidence presented during the trial' as justifying `a sentence at the upper end of the advisory guidelines.'\"); <i>United States v. Scherrer,</i> 444 F.3d 91, 94 (1st Cir.2006) (\"Taken at face value, these [mitigating] factors do at first seem to have weight; but the government gave some effective answers in the district court and it is fair to infer that the district court found them persuasive. That the district court did not elaborate on them&#8212;it said only that it took them into account&#8212;does not preclude the inference where the record explains it.\"); <i>United States v. Alli,</i> 444 F.3d 34, 41 (1st Cir.2006) (\"[Where the district court] simply stated, `[T]his is one of those cases . . . where I think the guidelines produce a sentence that is reasonable and perfectly consistent with the factors enumerated in the statute, 3553(a),' . . . we do not fault the judge for not speaking further about the &#167; 3553(a) factors, given that none were raised for his consideration and, in his independent judgment, none were worthy of further discussion.\" (second and third alterations in original)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that it is obvious that the district court chose not to apply the two recommended enhancements and that it then adopted the government's arguments for a sentence at the top of the resultant guidelines range. While this is certainly a plausible reading of the record, even if it were true, the district court's explanation would be insufficient as a matter of law. Section 3553(c)(1) requires that the trial judge identify its reason for selecting a sentence at a particular point within a range exceeding twenty-four months. <i>See Gilman,</i> 478 F.3d at 447 (\"[T]he statement here does not identify the reason that the district court imposed a sentence in the middle of the guideline range rather than elsewhere within that range (which spans more than 24 months), in direct violation of Section 3553(c)(1).\"). If the court below rejected the enhancements, which is by no means clear, the guidelines range of 168 to 210 months would exceed twenty-four months, and the court would have to explain why it chose the top of the range.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the court did not even approximate our <i>Jim&#233;nez-Beltre</i> approach nor provide any reasoned explanation for its determination, we will not infer several degrees of reasoning, including a specific explanation explicitly required by law, and guess what the district court was thinking. Therefore, on this ground,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> we vacate Gonz&#225;lez-Rivera's sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with this opinion and prior precedent. <i>Id.</i> at 446-47 (\"[I]f we are in fact unable to discern from the record the reasoning behind the district court's sentence, appellate review is frustrated and `it is incumbent upon us to vacate . . .' the decision below to provide the district court an opportunity to explain its reasoning at resentencing.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B.

Pho,</i> 433 F.3d 53, 54-57 (1st Cir.2006) (describing \"the history of the disparate treatment of crack and powdered cocaine embedded in the federal sentencing guidelines (commonly referred to as the 100:1 ratio)\").

Singleterry,</i> 29 F.3d 733, 740-41 (1st Cir.1994).

Gonz&#225;lez-Rivera offers no arguments that we have not consistently rejected before, <i>see Pho,</i> 433 F.3d at 61-65 (rejecting a variety of arguments against the ratio, including those based on the Sentencing Commission's effort to ease the discrepancy), and even so, based on our clear precedent, there was obviously no plain error on the part of the district court in applying the equivalency ratios.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonz&#225;lez-Rivera also challenges the equivalency ratio as so disproportional as to be unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment. The First Circuit has not squarely decided this issue, but every other circuit has rejected the argument that the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. <i>See United States v. Brooks,</i> 161 F.3d 1240, 1247 (10th Cir.1998); <i>United States v. Brazel,</i> 102 F.3d 1120, 1158 (11th Cir.1997); <i>United States v.

Moreover, we have stated many times before that \"[t]he decision to employ a 100:1 crack-to-powder ratio . . . is a policy judgment, pure and simple,\" and therefore it is up to Congress&#8212;not the courts&#8212;to adopt rational drug equivalency ratios. <i>Pho,</i> 433 F.3d at 62-63.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although this is enough to defeat Gonz&#225;lez-Rivera's argument under a plain error standard, we also point out that a defendant seeking proportionality review under the Eighth Amendment must \"demonstrate, at the threshold, an `initial inference of gross disproportionality' between the `gravity of [the] criminal conduct and the severity of the . . . penalty' imposed.\" <i>United States v. Cardoza,</i> 129 F.3d 6, 18 (1st Cir.1997) (internal citation omitted) (alterations in original). We have previously upheld a 280-month sentence for the distribution of 85.3 grams of crack cocaine against an Eighth Amendment challenge. <i>United States v. Graciani,</i> 61 F.3d 70, 76-77 (1st Cir.1995). Here, Gonz&#225;lez-Rivera's sentence was seventy months less for a conviction involving over ten grams more crack. We therefore cannot infer gross disproportionality in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.

Background</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Scene of the Crime</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 9, 2003, at approximately 5:45 p.m., Agents H&#233;ctor Valent&#237;n and Nelson Gonz&#225;lez-Rodr&#237;guez of the Puerto Rico Police Department's Special Arrests and Extraditions Division established surveillance of a residence in the R&#237;o Grande area of northeastern Puerto Rico, in relation to two local felony arrest warrants for Garc&#237;a-Carrasquillo and a fugitive arrest warrant for Claudio-Garc&#237;a.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The split-level house consisted of the main residence on the upper level, and a small ground-level apartment accessed by a door under a carport at the front of the house. The carport stood over a driveway that led to a gate and then out to the road in front of the house. The agents parked their unmarked car on the road approximately 100 meters up a hill from the house, where they could observe activity around the house with binoculars. From their vantage point, they could see a Ford Bronco parked under the carport at the front of the house. They could not see the door to the ground-level apartment located behind the Bronco, nor could they see a short staircase on the left side of the carport.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> They could, however, see the staircase leading to the main entrance on the upper level of the house.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Around two hours later, a stolen Mazda Proteg&#233;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> pulled up and parked on the road in front of the house, outside a gate across the driveway. Garc&#237;a-Carrasquillo and Claudio-Garc&#237;a exited the vehicle and entered the carport, presumably to enter the ground-level apartment at the rear of the carport, though it is unclear whether the agents actually saw the men enter, or later exit, through the door to the apartment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Fifteen minutes later, Garc&#237;a-Carrasquillo walked out from under the carport carrying an assault rifle, which he placed in the trunk of the Mazda Proteg&#233;. He then returned to the carport.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this point, the agents notified their supervisor, Lieutenant Herminio D&#237;az, of the situation. Lieutenant D&#237;az mobilized the SWAT team and posted two agents, Jos&#233; Nev&#225;rez Ortiz and Richard Carrera, at the back of the house. As the SWAT team approached the house, Jos&#233; David Cruz-Gonz&#225;lez, the owner of the house, who was somewhere outside the gate across the driveway in front of the house,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> ran through the gate toward the house shouting that the police were there. The three co-defendants in the case, Garc&#237;a-Carrasquillo, Claudio-Garc&#237;a, and Gonz&#225;lez-Rivera, then ran out of the ground-level apartment and joined Cruz-Gonz&#225;lez in fleeing towards the back of the house.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the back of the house, the four men jumped over a fence and continued to run. Agent Nev&#225;rez shouted for the men to stop and told them they were under arrest. The fleeing men and the officers then exchanged gunfire; Gonz&#225;lez-Rivera was shot in the leg. The men continued to run and exchange gunfire with the pursuing police until the four men fell into a large hole in the ground,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> where they were apprehended and arrested. The three co-defendants were each found with loaded firearms on their persons; however, no drugs or paraphernalia were found on any of the defendants at the time of their arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, back at the house, the SWAT team, Lieutenant D&#237;az, and Agent Valent&#237;n searched the ground-level apartment, where they found a large amount of cocaine and cocaine base (crack cocaine), a small amount of marijuana, and assorted drug paraphernalia, including a stove for cooking crack cocaine and items used to break up cocaine rocks. The cocaine base was packaged in approximately 972 vials, which were placed in plastic bags labeled by drug distribution point. The Mazda Proteg&#233; was taken to the police station after the arrest; when the police opened the trunk, they found an AR-15 rifle along with the AK-47 that the agents had seen Garc&#237;a-Carrasquillo put there during their surveillance. The police did not take any fingerprints from the drugs, paraphernalia, or firearms recovered from the apartment or the vehicle, nor from the firearms found on the defendants at the time of their arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Legal Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 10, 2003, the defendants were taken before a local magistrate judge for a probable cause hearing. After the judge advised the defendants of their right to remain silent, Garc&#237;a-Carrasquillo voluntarily disclosed that all of the drugs and firearms seized the previous day belonged to him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 17, 2003, a grand jury returned a seven-count Superseding Indictment against the defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Counts One and Two charged that all three defendants, aiding and abetting each other, knowingly possessed with the intent to distribute 96.87 grams of cocaine base and 299.96 grams of cocaine, respectively, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1). Count Three charged Garc&#237;a-Carrasquillo with knowingly possessing certain firearms in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1). Count Four charged all three defendants with knowingly using, carrying, and discharging certain firearms in relation to a drug trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(A)(iii), (C)(i). Counts Five and Six charged Garc&#237;a-Carrasquillo and Gonz&#225;lez-Rivera, respectively, with being a felon in possession of certain firearms in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1). Count Seven charged Claudio-Garc&#237;a with being a fugitive in possession of certain firearms, also in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants were tried over nine days in March and April of 2004. At the close of the government's case, the defendants moved for judgments of acquittal on the ground of insufficient evidence; the district court denied the motions. The court also denied the defendants' renewed motions for judgment of acquittal the following day. On April 22, 2004, a jury acquitted all three defendants of Count Four, and also acquitted Gonz&#225;lez-Rivera of Count Six, but found the three defendants guilty on all other counts as charged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 5 and 7, 2005, the district court sentenced the three defendants. Only Gonz&#225;lez-Rivera challenges his sentence, and therefore his is the only sentence we will discuss in detail.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Gonz&#225;lez-Rivera's presentence report (\"PSR\") calculated an initial base offense level of 32 pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1, after converting the quantities of cocaine base and cocaine powder into an equivalent quantity of marijuana using the Drug Equivalency Table. The PSR also recommended a two-level enhancement for possession of a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking offense, U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1), and another two-level increase for \"recklessly creat[ing] a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person in the course of fleeing from a law enforcement officer,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 3C1.2. Utilizing Gonz&#225;lez-Rivera's criminal history category of IV, the PSR calculated an advisory guideline range of 262 to 327 months imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonz&#225;lez-Rivera objected to the PSR on two grounds: (1) that the two recommended enhancements were inapplicable because the jury acquitted him of all firearms charges, and therefore application of the enhancements would violate his Sixth Amendment right under <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136995\"><a href=\"/opinion/136995/blakely-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136995\"><a href=\"/opinion/136995/blakely-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">403</span></a></span> (2004) (requiring that facts used to increase a defendant's sentence beyond the statutory maximum set by state sentencing guidelines be found by a jury);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> and (2) that if the court applied the two-level increase for possession of a firearm, the sentencing guidelines prohibited imposition of the second two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice because the same conduct was the basis of both adjustments, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.2 cmt. n. 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government responded by arguing that <i>Blakely</i> did not apply to the federal sentencing guidelines. The probation officer also responded to the defendant's objections, arguing that even though Gonz&#225;lez-Rivera had been acquitted of the firearms charges, the corresponding enhancement could still be applied pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3 because he aided and abetted others who were convicted of possessing firearms during the commission of the same offense.

The day after the defendants were arrested, they were taken before a state magistrate judge for a probable cause hearing. Although there was no written record of that hearing, Agent Valent&#237;n testified at trial that after the magistrate advised the defendants of their right to remain silent, Garc&#237;a-Carrasquillo voluntarily admitted that all the weapons and drugs seized from the house were his.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> His admission is unquestionably sufficient to support his conviction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sufficiency of the evidence against Claudio-Garc&#237;a is a much closer question. He argues that there was insufficient evidence of his constructive possession because there was no evidence that he had dominion or control over the drugs. He also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence of aiding and abetting, arguing that there was no evidence that he willfully intended to help Garc&#237;a-Carrasquillo in the crime of possession with intent to distribute. Claudio-Garc&#237;a asserts that the evidence proves, at most, that he was merely present at the scene.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having affirmed the sufficiency of the evidence that Garc&#237;a-Carrasquillo was the principal, we need only satisfy ourselves that there was evidence presented from which a rational juror could infer that Claudio-Garc&#237;a intended to aid Garc&#237;a-Carrasquillo in his crime of possession with intent to distribute. If the government successfully proves aiding and abetting, it does not need to prove that Claudio-Garc&#237;a himself actually or constructively possessed the drugs, since either theory of guilt alone would sustain his conviction. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2(a) (\"Whoever commits an offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission, is punishable as a principal.\"); <i>see also United States v.

From this evidence, a rational juror could reasonably infer that Claudio-Garc&#237;a accompanied his uncle to the house filled with drugs because Garc&#237;a-Carrasquillo trusted his nephew enough to enlist his help in committing the crime charged. <i>Cf. United States v. Rinc&#243;n,</i> 180 Fed.Appx. 376, 379 (3d Cir.2006) (allowing inference that drug dealer trusted defendant based on evidence that dealer left drugs with defendant, in part to support conviction for aiding and abetting in drug sale). The jury could further infer that Claudio-Garc&#237;a was in fact so aiding his uncle, especially given that he knowingly ran from and shot at the police when they attempted to apprehend them. <i>See L&#243;pez-L&#243;pez,</i> 282 F.3d at 21 (\"[The defendant] ran when he saw the police and hid in a field, which suggests awareness of guilt.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claudio-Garc&#237;a correctly points out that there is another, more plausible explanation for his presence at the scene and his attempt to flee: He was an armed fugitive in hiding with a wanted family member, and he ran in order to avoid capture by the police. While this could be true, the government need not exclude every possible explanation. <i>See United States v.

Hence, there was sufficient&#8212;albeit circumstantial and not particularly strong&#8212;evidence that Claudio-Garc&#237;a's presence at the scene and association with his uncle were not just \"mere\" presence and association, <i>see Echeverri,</i> 982 F.2d at 678 (\"[A] defendant's `mere presence' argument will fail in situations where the `mere' is lacking.\"), but rather that he was a culpable participant in Garc&#237;a-Carrasquillo's crime of possession with intent to distribute, <i>see United States v.

We directed trial courts to engage in a \"sequential determination of the guideline range, including any proposed departures, followed by the further determination whether other factors identified by either side warrant an ultimate sentence above or below the guideline range.\" <i>Id.</i> An important prerequisite to our reasonableness analysis is the district court's reasoned explanation for the sentence imposed, as required by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(c). <i>Id.</i> at 519. This is true even if the sentence is within the guidelines range. <i>See United States v.

This case exceeds those limits. The district judge gave a one-sentence explanation of her choice of sentence, which conclusorily stated that she had considered the appropriate adjustments and the &#167; 3553(a) factors. She did not explain her guidelines calculation, nor did she include any reasoned analysis or reference any evidence that influenced her decision. She merely stated the sentence and paraphrased three of the seven enumerated factors, which she apparently considered important.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, we are unable to discern the court's reasoning by looking to the record of the parties' arguments. The government argued for a sentence at the top of the guidelines range considering two enhancements, whereas the defendant requested a sentence at the bottom of the range without the enhancements, citing mitigating factors. The district judge did not explain whether she applied one or both recommended enhancements, what the applicable guidelines range was, whether she thought the defendant deserved a sentence at any point within a particular range, or whether she was influenced by either sides' arguments enough to depart from one of the two ranges under consideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consequently, this case differs from other cases in which we were able to understand with a modicum of certitude the reasons behind the district court's choice of sentence by reviewing the sentencing record. <i>See, e.g., United States v.

While this is certainly a plausible reading of the record, even if it were true, the district court's explanation would be insufficient as a matter of law.

Therefore, on this ground,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> we vacate Gonz&#225;lez-Rivera's sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with this opinion and prior precedent. <i>Id.</i> at 446-47 (\"[I]f we are in fact unable to discern from the record the reasoning behind the district court's sentence, appellate review is frustrated and `it is incumbent upon us to vacate . . .' the decision below to provide the district court an opportunity to explain its reasoning at resentencing.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B.
