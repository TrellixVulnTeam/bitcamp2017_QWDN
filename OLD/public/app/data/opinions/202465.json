Castro Lang on brief for appellant.\n     Nelson Peréz-Sosa, Assistant U.S. Attorney, Germán A.\nRieckehoff, Assistant U.S. Attorney, and H.S.

Paulino Serrano (\"Paulino\"), who\n\npled       guilty   to   conspiring         to   possess      heroin    with   intent    to\n\ndistribute it and aiding and abetting others in possessing a gun\n\nduring       and    in   relation      to    that    offense,        appeals   from     his\n\nconviction.         On appeal, he argues that his guilty plea should be\n\nvacated because (1) the magistrate judge, who recommended that his\n\nguilty plea be accepted, did not adequately explain the nature of\n\nthe charges against him and (2) there was an insufficient factual\n\nbasis for his plea.            Specifically, Paulino claims that he did not\n\nknow that the alleged conspiracy involved drugs.1                        The government\n\nargues that these challenges were not raised in the district court\n\nand that, therefore, the validity of Paulino's plea is reviewable\n\nonly under the appellant-unfriendly plain-error standard, rather\n\nthan the abuse-of-discretion standard that otherwise applies to\n\nsuch claims.        See United States v. Matos-Quiñones, 456 F.3d 14, 21\n\nn.8 (1st Cir. 2006). We need not determine the applicable standard\n\nof appellate review, however, because, as discussed below, under\n\neither       standard,    we    find    no       error   in    the     district   court's\n\nacceptance of Paulino's plea.\n\n\n\n       1\n      At his change of plea hearing in the district court, Paulino\nalso initially disputed his possession of a gun, but, after he\nadmitted knowing that other participants were carrying firearms,\nand the government and the magistrate judge explained that he need\nnot have been physically carrying a firearm to be subject to being\ncharged with aiding and abetting others in doing so, see United\nStates v. Negrón-Narváez, 403 F.3d 33, 37-38 (1st Cir. 2005), he\ndropped that argument and does not press it on appeal.\n\n                                             -2-\n\f              We start our analysis by reiterating that, for acceptance\n\nof a guilty plea to be valid under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of\n\nCriminal Procedure, the plea colloquy need not be perfect.              United\n\nStates v. Padilla-Galarza, 351 F.3d 594, 598 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\nIndeed, the rule itself requires us to overlook minor errors in the\n\nplea proceedings that do not affect substantial rights.                Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 11(h); see also United States v. Raineri, 42 F.3d 36, 45\n\n(1st Cir. 1994).\n\n              As to the district court's obligation to explain the\n\nnature   of    the   charges,    \"Rule    11   expressly   requires   that   the\n\ndistrict court 'inform the defendant of, and determine that the\n\ndefendant understands . . . the nature of each charge to which the\n\ndefendant is pleading,'\"           Matos-Quiñones, 456 F.3d at 21 n.8\n\n(quoting Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(b)(1)(G)), and we have construed that\n\nobligation to \"'includ[e] ensuring that the defendant understands\n\nthe elements of the charges that the prosecution would have to\n\nprove at trial,'\" id. (quoting United States v. Gandia-Maysonet,\n\n227 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2000)).            However, \"[t]he manner in which\n\nthe   charge    is   explained    and    the   method   for   determining    the\n\ndefendant's understanding of the charge will vary from case to case\n\ndepending upon the complexity of the charges, the capacity of the\n\ndefendant, and the attendant circumstances.\"                  United States v.\n\nCotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1995).             Furthermore, \"[i]t is\n\nnot necessary that the explanation of the charges come directly\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\ffrom the court . . . if it can be discerned from a review of the\n\nproceeding that the defendant nevertheless understood the charges.\"\n\nId. at 5.\n\n             Under those standards, the district court's explanation\n\nof the conspiracy charge in this case was sufficient. \"'[While the\n\nsubtleties of conspiracy law may be the bane of criminal law\n\nstudents, the basic principle is easily understood:              a group of\n\npeople agreeing to do something illegal.'\"             Cotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d\n\nat 6 (quoting United States v. Carter, 815 F.2d 827, 829 (1st Cir.\n\n1987)).      In more legalistic terms, \"the criminal agreement itself\n\nis the actus reus,\" United States v. Shabani, 513 U.S. 10, 16\n\n(1994); to establish a violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846, the Government\n\nneed not prove the commission of any overt acts in furtherance of\n\nthe conspiracy,\" id. at 15.\n\n             Here, Paulino pled guilty to conspiring to possess heroin\n\nwith intent to distribute it.         After he stated that he did not know\n\nthat   the    money   he   received   from    his   co-conspirators   was   the\n\nproceeds of the sale of drugs and that he did not see any drugs,\n\nthe court explained that \"[t]he fact that you didn't see drugs\n\ndoesn't mean anything.         As long as you thought you were dealing\n\nwith drugs . . . that's part of the elements of conspiracy, an\n\nagreement to commit a crime.\"                After furthering questioning,\n\nPaulino agreed that he \"did know that the case had to do with\n\ndrugs\" and that he met with his co-conspirators on a particular\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fdate to discuss stealing a kilogram of heroin.                    On the basis of\n\nthat colloquy, the magistrate judge reported that Paulino was\n\n\"aware of the nature of the offenses charged\" and recommended that\n\nthe court accept his guilty plea.              Similarly, in accepting that\n\nreport   and   recommendation,       the   district       court   concluded       that\n\nPaulino's plea \"contain[ed] all elements of the offense charged in\n\nthe    indictment.\"       We   see   no    abuse     of    discretion       in   those\n\ndeterminations.\n\n             For much the same reasons, we conclude that the district\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in adopting the magistrate\n\njudge's determination that Paulino \"underst[ood] that the charges\n\nare supported by the government's evidence.\"                  Although \"Rule 11\n\nrequires a court to 'determine that there is a factual basis for\n\nthe plea' before entering judgment,\" United States v. Delgado-\n\nHernández, 420 F.3d 16, 19 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting Fed. R. Crim.\n\nP.    11(b)(3)),    the   question    before    the       court   in   making     that\n\ndetermination \"'is not whether a jury would, or even would be\n\nlikely, to convict:       it is whether there is enough evidence so that\n\nthe plea has a rational basis in facts that the defendant concedes\n\nor    that   the    government   proffers       as    supported        by   credible\n\nevidence.'\"        Id. (quoting Gandia-Maysonet, 227 F.3d at 6).                   In\n\nother words, all that is required is \"'some . . . basis for\n\nthinking that the defendant is at least arguably guilty.'\"                        Id.\n\n(quoting Gandia-Maysonet, 227 F.3d at 6).\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f            Here, the relevant facts--Paulino's agreement with his\n\nco-conspirators to steal \"kilogram weights\" of heroin--came both\n\nfrom Paulino's own admission that he so agreed and from the\n\ngovernment's proffer of audio and video tape-recordings of Paulino\n\nat the meeting where the agreement was made.      The mere fact that\n\nPaulino initially disputed the peripheral fact that the money he\n\nlater received was the product of the sale of the heroin does not\n\ndispel the factual basis for his plea.       \"That sort of temporary\n\ncontradiction is inherent in virtually every change of plea.\"\n\nNegrón-Narváez, 403 F.3d at 39; see also United States v. Cheal,\n\n389 F.3d 35, 41 (1st Cir. 2004).        What matters is whether \"his\n\nfinal answer . . . comprised a factual basis sufficient to allow\n\nthe district court to accept the proffered plea.\"    Negrón-Narváez,\n\n403 F.3d at 39.    Based on \"[t]he government['s] . . . . extensive\n\nproffer of its evidence[,] with which [Paulino] concurred in\n\npertinent part,\" the magistrate judge \"determined that there is a\n\nbasis in fact and evidence to establish all elements of the\n\noffenses charged\" and accordingly recommended that the plea be\n\naccepted.    We see no abuse of discretion in the district court's\n\nadoption of that report and recommendation.\n\n            Affirmed.   See 1st Cir. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\f",

Crim.\n\nP.    11(b)(3)),    the   question    before    the       court   in   making     that\n\ndetermination \"'is not whether a jury would, or even would be\n\nlikely, to convict:       it is whether there is enough evidence so that\n\nthe plea has a rational basis in facts that the defendant concedes\n\nor    that   the    government   proffers       as    supported        by   credible\n\nevidence.'\"        Id. (quoting Gandia-Maysonet, 227 F.3d at 6).                   In\n\nother words, all that is required is \"'some . . . basis for\n\nthinking that the defendant is at least arguably guilty.'\"                        Id.\n\n(quoting Gandia-Maysonet, 227 F.3d at 6).\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f            Here, the relevant facts--Paulino's agreement with his\n\nco-conspirators to steal \"kilogram weights\" of heroin--came both\n\nfrom Paulino's own admission that he so agreed and from the\n\ngovernment's proffer of audio and video tape-recordings of Paulino\n\nat the meeting where the agreement was made.      The mere fact that\n\nPaulino initially disputed the peripheral fact that the money he\n\nlater received was the product of the sale of the heroin does not\n\ndispel the factual basis for his plea.       \"That sort of temporary\n\ncontradiction is inherent in virtually every change of plea.\"\n\nNegrón-Narváez, 403 F.3d at 39; see also United States v. Cheal,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201336\"><a href=\"/opinion/201336/united-states-v-cheal/\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 41 (1st Cir. 2004).        What matters is whether \"his\n\nfinal answer . . . comprised a factual basis sufficient to allow\n\nthe district court to accept the proffered plea.\"    Negrón-Narváez,\n\n403 F.3d at 39.    Based on \"[t]he government['s] . . . . extensive\n\nproffer of its evidence[,] with which [Paulino] concurred in\n\npertinent part,\" the magistrate judge \"determined that there is a\n\nbasis in fact and evidence to establish all elements of the\n\noffenses charged\" and accordingly recommended that the plea be\n\naccepted.    We see no abuse of discretion in the district court's\n\nadoption of that report and recommendation.\n\n            Affirmed.   See 1st Cir. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\f</pre>",
