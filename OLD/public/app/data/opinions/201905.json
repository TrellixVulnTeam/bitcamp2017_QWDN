This case raises several issues of\n\nimportance, including whether a district court may punish the\n\nprosecution by granting the defendant a lower than warranted\n\nsentence after trial because the government had engaged in \"fact\n\nbargaining.\"\n\n            Three       men,   Rafael   Yeje-Cabrera,        Wilfredo   Pérez,    and\n\nWilliam Olivero, were convicted, after a twenty-day jury trial, of\n\nconspiracy    to    possess      with   intent    to    distribute      cocaine   in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. § 846.           The conspiracy distributed over 260\n\nkilograms of cocaine. Yeje-Cabrera was also convicted of attempted\n\npossession with intent to distribute cocaine in violation of 21\n\nU.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and of bribery of a federal agent in violation\n\nof   18   U.S.C.    §    201(b).    These      men,    and   others,    distributed\n\ntruckloads full of cocaine obtained from two Mexican suppliers; the\n\ndrugs were driven from the Southwest to Massachusetts, Rhode\n\nIsland, and New York.           Yeje-Cabrera, of Westport, Massachusetts,\n\nwas a principal in the operation and received a life sentence and\n\na fine of $16 million.           Yeje-Cabrera was also ordered to forfeit\n\n$5.2 million and two parcels of real property.                    Pérez helped to\n\ndistribute the cocaine and was an agent for Yeje-Cabrera.                   He was\n\nsentenced to thirty years' imprisonment and fined $4 million.\n\nOlivero, who lived in New York, collected the money, distributed\n\ncocaine, and assisted with the shipments.                    By contrast with the\n\n\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fthirty-year sentence for Pérez, Olivero was sentenced to 48 months'\n\nimprisonment, followed by five years of supervised release.\n\n             Yeje-Cabrera attacks his conviction and the forfeiture\n\norder.       Pérez    attacks   his   conviction     through     a    premature\n\nineffective assistance of counsel claim.              Olivero attacks his\n\nconviction.     All three defendants attack their sentences.\n\n             The government was also unhappy with the sentence imposed\n\non Olivero and has cross-appealed.          It is the government's appeal\n\nwhich raises the most significant issues in the case.                In order to\n\nsanction the government for what it considered to be impermissible\n\n\"fact bargaining,\" the district court declined to follow the\n\nSentencing Guidelines.       This was error.       The fact bargaining was\n\nthe    government's   willingness     during   earlier   unsuccessful        plea\n\nnegotiations to recommend a lower sentence when the facts known to\n\nit at the time, or so the court found, justified a higher sentence.\n\nThe court declined to give a warranted firearms enhancement and did\n\ngive    an   unwarranted   minimal-role     reduction.     The       court   also\n\nconcluded, mistakenly, that its role as a fact finder with respect\n\nto drug quantity for sentencing purposes had been written out of\n\nthe Sentencing Guidelines by the decision in Apprendi v. New\n\nJersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000).\n\n             We affirm all three convictions and the sentences of\n\nYeje-Cabrera and Pérez. We vacate Olivero's sentence and remand it\n\nto the district court for re-sentencing.\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f                  I. Statement of Facts and Proceedings\n\n            Yeje-Cabrera was a leader of a conspiracy to ship cocaine\n\nfrom the Southwest to various states in the Northeast, where it was\n\nsold.    Pérez assisted with the distribution of cocaine.          Olivero\n\nassisted with the collection of money and the distribution and\n\nshipping of cocaine.\n\n            Two seizures of tractor-trailers full of cocaine provide\n\nthe bookends for this case.     In April of 2001, after using a camera\n\nto conduct surveillance of a parking lot in New York City, agents\n\nof the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) seized a tractor-\n\ntrailer containing over 300 kilograms of cocaine and over $400,000\n\nin cash.        The agents found a cellular telephone inside that\n\ncontained telephone numbers for Yeje-Cabrera and Olivero.                 DEA\n\nagents   then    conducted   surveillance   of    Yeje-Cabrera's   home   in\n\nWestport, Massachusetts via a hidden camera in a birdhouse, but\n\nYeje-Cabrera discovered the camera and realized that he was under\n\nsurveillance.      Some time later, the DEA agents applied for and\n\nreceived permission to conduct electronic surveillance of Yeje-\n\nCabrera's   phone    line.    This   initial     wiretap   application    was\n\nfollowed by others seeking permission to conduct surveillance on\n\nmultiple phone lines belonging to Yeje-Cabrera and another suspect.\n\nAll were allowed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f          In August 2001, the INS1 initiated removal proceedings in\n\nBoston against Yeje-Cabrera and detained him.       He reacted by\n\nbribing an INS agent to terminate the proceedings and, in a series\n\nof recorded conversations, offering to pay another bribe for\n\ninformation regarding the drug investigation.     Yeje-Cabrera was\n\nreleased on his own recognizance and resumed his drug business.\n\nPérez and Olivero, with Yeje-Cabrera, continued to arrange for and\n\nconduct the shipment of, payment for, and distribution of cocaine.\n\nMeanwhile, DEA agents were monitoring Yeje-Cabrera's phone lines\n\nand attempting to engage in other forms of surveillance.       The\n\nagents prepared to move in on the operation on December 8, 2001,\n\nwhen Yeje-Cabrera and his associates were slated to receive a large\n\nshipment of cocaine near New Bedford, Massachusetts.    DEA agents\n\nand state police were out in force that morning, searching for the\n\nparticipants in the anticipated delivery.     As it happened, the\n\ndrugs came to them: the ill-fated driver of the tractor-trailer,\n\ninstead of making his delivery, accidentally backed into a state\n\ntrooper's cruiser.   Law enforcement agents seized the tractor-\n\ntrailer and discovered that it contained 260 kilograms of cocaine.\n\nThat seizure has the dubious distinction of being the largest drug\n\nseizure in Massachusetts history.\n\n\n     1\n       On March 1, 2003, the relevant functions of the INS were\ntransferred to the Department of Homeland Security, and the INS\nsubsequently ceased to exist. See Homeland Security Act of 2002,\nPub. L. No. 107-296, § 471, 116 Stat. 2135, 2205 (codified as\namended at 6 U.S.C. § 291(a)).\n\n                               -6-\n\f              The   conspiracy    continued       to    receive    and    distribute\n\ncocaine for a short while longer.              Finally, on December 21, 2001,\n\nofficers      arrested       Yeje-Cabrera,       Pérez,     and    several        other\n\ncoconspirators.        Olivero ultimately turned himself in.\n\n              All three defendants were charged in the December 20,\n\n2001 indictment with conspiracy to distribute more than five\n\nkilograms of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1),\n\n841(b)(1)(A)(ii), and 846.         Yeje-Cabrera was also charged with two\n\nadditional crimes: attempted possession with intent to distribute\n\nmore than five kilograms of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A)(ii), and 846, and bribery of a federal\n\nagent, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 201(b). The indictment charged\n\nthat all defendants held certain real property, vehicles, and\n\ncurrency which were subject to criminal forfeiture under 21 U.S.C.\n\n§ 853.\n\n              Before    trial,    Yeje-Cabrera         unsuccessfully      moved    to\n\nsuppress the evidence obtained as a result of the various wiretaps.\n\nHe   argued    that    the    affidavits       submitted    in    support    of     the\n\nelectronic      surveillance      applications         failed     to    satisfy    the\n\n\"necessity\" requirement of 18 U.S.C. § 2518(1)(c).\n\n              The   jury     convicted   Yeje-Cabrera       of    all    counts;     it\n\nreturned a special verdict, finding that he was responsible for\n\nmore than 260 kilograms of cocaine on the conspiracy charge and\n\nexactly 260 kilograms on the attempt charge, and a forfeiture\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fverdict. The jury convicted Pérez of conspiracy to distribute more\n\nthan five kilograms of cocaine.              It also convicted Olivero of\n\nconspiracy to distribute cocaine, though it did not attribute to\n\nhim a specific drug quantity.          That failure by the jury to make a\n\nspecific finding led to some of the conviction and sentencing\n\nissues we discuss later.\n\n            The   district   court      sentenced   Yeje-Cabrera   to   life\n\nimprisonment.     It also fined him and, during sentencing, stated\n\nthat   it   was   \"allow[ing]    the    government's   recommendation    for\n\nforfeiture.\" The court sentenced Pérez to 360 months' imprisonment\n\nand fined him $4 million.       The court sentenced Olivero to 48 months\n\nof incarceration.2\n\n                             II. Discussion\n\nA. Challenges to Conviction\n\n            1. Denial of Motion to Suppress Wiretap Evidence\n\n\n\n\n     2\n       After both Olivero and the government filed notices of\nappeal, the district court issued an order purporting to vacate\nOlivero's sentence in order to impose an even shorter sentence.\nThe court cited concerns about the appropriate drug quantity to\nattribute to Olivero in light of Apprendi and other authorities,\nand it stated that it was going to schedule a new sentencing\nhearing.    Upon being told by the government that it lacked\njurisdiction, the court vacated its attempt to vacate Olivero's\nsentence. The court did proceed, however, to issue what was in\nessence a sentencing memorandum pertaining not only to Olivero's\ncase but also to several other unrelated criminal cases, explaining\nin more detail its reasons for the sentence it had imposed on\nOlivero and its belief that the maximum constitutionally\npermissible sentence for Olivero was 16 months. United States v.\nGreen, 346 F. Supp. 2d 259, 327, 332 (D. Mass. 2004).\n\n                                       -8-\n\f            Yeje-Cabrera argues that the district court should have\n\nexcluded evidence derived from electronic surveillance of telephone\n\nconversations because the wiretap applications failed to meet the\n\nstatutory requirements.      If the intercepted conversations and all\n\nevidence derived therefrom had been properly excluded, he argues,\n\nhis convictions would not stand.\n\n            Yeje-Cabrera     bases    his     challenge   on    18   U.S.C.\n\n§ 2518(1)(c), which states that each wiretap application \"shall\n\ninclude . . . a full and complete statement as to whether or not\n\nother investigative procedures have been tried and failed or why\n\nthey reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be\n\ntoo dangerous.\"\n\n            The parties disagree on the proper standard of review.\n\nWe have long applied a unitary standard of review in § 2518(1)(c)\n\ncases: \"When reviewing the government's showing of necessity, our\n\nrole 'is not to make a de novo determination of sufficiency as if\n\n[we] were [the issuing judge], but to decide if the facts set forth\n\nin   the   application     were   minimally    adequate   to   support   the\n\ndetermination that was made.\"        United States v. Santana, 342 F.3d\n\n60, 65 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting United States v. López, 300 F.3d\n\n46, 53 (1st Cir. 2002) (alterations in original)).\n\n            Yeje-Cabrera urges us to adopt a bifurcated standard of\n\nreview: first, we should review de novo whether the applicant\n\nprovided to the issuing judge a \"full and complete statement\" as\n\n                                     -9-\n\frequired by § 2518(1)(c); second, if and only if the first prong is\n\nsatisfied, we should review for abuse of discretion the issuing\n\njudge's determination that, under the circumstances described,\n\nelectronic   surveillance   was   necessary.   One   reason   for   this\n\napproach, Yeje-Cabrera suggests, is that § 2518 imposes separate\n\nduties on separate actors: the applicant has an \"absolute\" duty\n\nunder § 2518(1)(c), while the issuing judge has a \"discretionary\"\n\nduty under § 2518(3)(c).3   Another reason for de novo review of the\n\n\"full and complete statement\" requirement, he argues, is that it\n\nwould give effect to the necessity requirement: it would ensure\n\nthat necessity is actually present, that the issuing judge is able\n\nto engage in an independent determination on that point, rather\n\nthan one subject to the affiant's manipulation of the facts, and\n\nthat meaningful appellate review is possible.\n\n          Though we recognize that other circuits have adopted\n\nbifurcated standards similar to that proposed by Yeje-Cabrera, see,\n\ne.g., United States v. Ramirez-Encarnacion, 291 F.3d 1219, 1222 n.1\n\n(10th Cir. 2002); United States v. Blackmon, 273 F.3d 1204, 1207\n\n(9th Cir. 2001), this panel is bound by circuit precedent.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n        Section 2518(3)(c) provides that upon receiving an\napplication as described in § 2518(1), \"the judge may enter an ex\nparte order\" authorizing the wiretap \"if the judge determines on\nthe basis of the facts submitted by the applicant that . . . normal\ninvestigative procedures have been tried and have failed or\nreasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too\ndangerous.\"\n\n                                  -10-\n\f            Moreover, we see no reason to depart from the unitary\n\nstandard.    First, Yeje-Cabrera's approach artificially separates\n\ntwo concepts that are a unified whole in the statute: \"full and\n\ncomplete statement,\" and \"necessity.\"     One might ask: of what must\n\nthe applicant provide a \"full and complete statement\"?    The answer\n\nis: of \"whether or not other investigative procedures have been\n\ntried and failed or why they reasonably appear to be unlikely to\n\nsucceed if tried or to be too dangerous.\"     § 2518(1)(c).   This is\n\none requirement, not two: a full and complete statement regarding\n\nnecessity, that is, circumstances in which a wiretap, though\n\ndisfavored as an investigative technique, is justified. See United\n\nStates v. Kahn, 415 U.S. 143, 153 n.12 (1974) (the necessity\n\nrequirement is \"designed to assure that wiretapping is not resorted\n\nto in situations where traditional investigative techniques would\n\nsuffice to expose the crime\").    We see no basis for splitting in\n\ntwo what is properly a single inquiry.\n\n            The determination of necessity is properly committed to\n\nthe issuing judge in the first instance, and we will uphold the\n\nsufficiency of the affidavit wherever \"the issuing court could have\n\nreasonably    concluded   that   normal   investigatory   procedures\n\nreasonably appeared to be unlikely to succeed.\" López, 300 F.3d at\n\n53 (quoting United States v. Ashley, 876 F.2d 1069, 1074 (1st Cir.\n\n1989)).   It is simply \"not our province to engage in de novo review\n\nof an application.\"   United States v. Bynum, 763 F.2d 474, 476 (1st\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fCir. 1985) (quoting United States v. Smith, 726 F.2d 852, 864 (1st\n\nCir. 1984)); see also United States v. Rivera-Rosario, 300 F.3d 1,\n\n19 n.23 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n            We also note that the issuing judge has the power to\n\n\"require      the   applicant        to   furnish       additional    testimony     or\n\ndocumentary evidence in support of the application,\" § 2518(2), if\n\nsuch   information      is   necessary.          Of    course,    officers   may   not\n\ndeliberately omit material information that, if known to the\n\nissuing judge, would prevent a finding of necessity.                     Should the\n\ndefendant come to believe that the government omitted material\n\ninformation that would have prevented a finding of necessity, he is\n\nfree to seek a hearing under Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154\n\n(1978).     See, e.g., United States v. Stewart, 337 F.3d 103, 105\n\n(1st   Cir.     2003)    (district        court       held   Franks   hearing      with\n\ngovernment's consent where search warrant affidavits misleadingly\n\nomitted multiple pieces of information casting doubt on credibility\n\nof informants); id. at 105-06 (not error to deny suppression of\n\nresulting     evidence       where    improperly        omitted    information     was\n\nimmaterial to overall determination of probable cause); id. at 107\n\nn.2 (\"An evidentiary hearing is required only if the defendant is\n\nable to show that alleged misstatements or omissions are material\n\nto the probable cause determination.\").                  A Franks hearing, not de\n\nnovo review in this court, is the proper route for addressing that\n\nconcern.    Cf. Rivera-Rosario, 300 F.3d at 20 (\"Material omissions\n\n\n                                          -12-\n\fin a government's application are . . . sufficient to constitute\n\nthe basis for a Franks evidentiary hearing.\" (citation omitted)).\n\nYeje-Cabrera, however, did not pursue this option.\n\n            Applying our unitary standard of review, we inquire\n\nwhether the affidavits satisfied the statutory requirement.                After\n\nreviewing the sealed affidavits, we hold that they provided a\n\nsufficient basis for the issuing judge to authorize the wiretap.\n\nWithout    revealing    any    of   the    information   for   which   it     was\n\nappropriate to seal the affidavits, we note that the initial\n\naffidavit supplies a detailed overview of the investigation to\n\ndate, concrete reasons why a wiretap was necessary, and thorough\n\nexplanations     of   how    traditional    investigative     techniques    were\n\nproving,   or    were   expected    to    prove,   unlikely    to   succeed    or\n\ndangerous.      These representations were supported.\n\n            The initial affidavit could reasonably be thought to be\n\nmore than adequate.         After receiving authorization to conduct the\n\nfirst wiretap, the officers applied for and received authorization\n\nto conduct others and to extend some beyond the initial time\n\nperiod.    As Yeje-Cabrera points out, the subsequent affidavits do\n\noverlap considerably with the initial affidavit and with each\n\nother, sometimes containing identical wording of some points.                 The\n\nlast affidavit, seeking authorization to wiretap a telephone line\n\nover which officers expected to hear \"vital information\" on a large\n\ncocaine delivery expected to occur the next day, incorporates by\n\n                                     -13-\n\freference the statement of necessity set out in a prior (attached)\n\naffidavit, instead of setting out a fresh one.       Despite Yeje-\n\nCabrera's characterization of the affidavits as consisting largely\n\nof \"boilerplate,\" all the affidavits did contain much that was\n\nconcrete and pertained to this specific investigation.     See López,\n\n300 F.3d at 53-54 (rejecting defendant's argument that application\n\nwas \"mere boilerplate\" where affidavit contained specific details\n\nabout the investigation and about attempts to use less invasive\n\nsurveillance techniques).   We have reviewed these affidavits and\n\nfind no flaws in the issuing court's determination that they were\n\nsufficient.\n\n          Yeje-Cabrera raises several objections to the conclusion\n\nthat there was no abuse of discretion by the issuing judge in\n\ndetermining that the affidavits were sufficient.         His primary\n\nargument is that a statement which appears in all of the affidavits\n\nconstitutes an admission that the affiant \"expressly ignored the\n\n'full and complete statement' requirement.\"   The officer applying\n\nfor the wiretap authorization stated near the beginning of each\n\naffidavit:\n\n          Since this Affidavit is being submitted for\n          the limited purpose of securing an order\n          authorizing   the    interception    of   wire\n          communications, I have not included details of\n          every aspect of this investigation to date.\n          Facts not set forth herein are not being\n          relied on in reaching my conclusion that an\n          order should be issued.\n\n\n                               -14-\n\fYeje-Cabrera argues that 18 U.S.C. § 2518(1)(c) requires the\n\napplication to describe \"all prior investigative steps undertaken.\"\n\n              The    argument   fundamentally      misreads    18    U.S.C.\n\n§ 2518(1)(c).        The requirement of a full and complete statement\n\ncannot possibly mean that every single detail, even if relevant to\n\nthe wiretap, must be included.       The plain language of § 2518(1)(c)\n\nonly requires a full and complete statement \"as to\" the crucial\n\nissue: \"whether or not other investigative procedures have been\n\ntried and failed or why they reasonably appear to be unlikely to\n\nsucceed if tried.\"       18 U.S.C. § 2518(1)(c).      Many aspects of an\n\ninvestigation, especially in a large, complex case like this one,\n\nwill not be relevant to the question of whether a particular\n\nwiretap is necessary.       And even if there is some relevance, the\n\nofficer need not detail every single fact, so long as sufficient\n\nfacts are described as to the crucial issue and material contrary\n\nfacts   are    not   omitted.   If   there   are   relevant   and   material\n\nomissions, the issuing judge may deny the application or seek\n\nadditional information, or the defendant may seek a Franks hearing.\n\n              Second, Yeje-Cabrera argues that the government did not\n\ndo enough to exhaust traditional investigative methods before\n\nresorting to the wiretap.       We have previously made clear, though,\n\nthat \"the government need not demonstrate that it exhausted all\n\ninvestigative procedures.\"      Santana, 342 F.3d at 65 (citing López,\n\n300 F.3d at 52). The wiretap application simply \"must 'demonstrate\n\n                                     -15-\n\fthat the government has made a reasonable, good faith effort to run\n\nthe gamut of normal investigative procedures before resorting to\n\nmeans so intrusive as electronic interception of telephone calls.'\"\n\nId. (quoting United States v. London, 66 F.3d 1227, 1237 (1st Cir.\n\n1995)); see also Ashley, 876 F.2d at 1072 (\"[T]he government is not\n\nrequired to show that other methods have been wholly unsuccessful.\n\nNor is the government forced to run outlandish risks or to exhaust\n\nevery conceivable alternative before requesting authorization for\n\nelectronic surveillance.\" (citations omitted)).    We conclude that\n\nthe district court did not err in refusing to suppress the evidence\n\nobtained from the wiretaps.\n\n            2. Claim of Error in District Court Inquiry of Jurors\n\n            Yeje-Cabrera raises a claim of jury taint arising from a\n\nnote that a juror sent to the judge.        We review for abuse of\n\ndiscretion the claim that the trial court failed to conduct an\n\nappropriate inquiry into allegations of jury taint.   United States\n\nv. Paniagua-Ramos, 251 F.3d 242, 249 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n            At the commencement of the trial, the district court\n\ninstructed the jurors that they must not discuss the case with each\n\nother or with anyone else during the trial, that it was the\n\ngovernment's burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and\n\nthat the defendants were not obliged to testify or present any\n\nevidence.   For the first ten days of trial, there was no inkling of\n\n\n\n\n                                -16-\n\fanything awry with any juror.     Then, during the eleventh day of\n\ntrial, a juror sent a note to the judge.    The note said:\n\n          WHY [ARE] THE DEFENDANTS\n          NOT GOING TO BE\n          CROSS-EXAMINED?\n\n          4 DEFENDANTS SHOULD\n          BE CROSS-EXAMINED!\n\n          THIS SHOULD BE\n          DONE IN THIS CASE!\n\n          The court shared this note with counsel. Defense counsel\n\nurged the court to identify the juror, interview her and the other\n\njurors individually to ascertain whether she had spoken with them,\n\nthen excuse her.    The court declined, opting instead to issue a\n\nstrongly worded curative instruction on the burden of proof and on\n\njurors' duty to refrain from discussion.   The court instructed the\n\nmembers of the jury that if any of them could not follow these\n\ninstructions, he or she was to speak with the clerk.   It polled the\n\njury as a group, asking for a show of hands on whether jurors had\n\ndiscussed the case among themselves.    No juror admitted doing so.\n\n          That night and the next morning, the juror who had sent\n\nthe note to the judge communicated with the court and its clerk\n\nmultiple times.    She expressed that she was upset over the judge's\n\nhandling of the note and that she still had opinions about the case\n\nthat were consistent with her note.      By the time trial was to\n\nresume on the twelfth day, the court had dismissed this juror and\n\nso informed counsel.     Defense counsel again requested that the\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\fcourt interview the remaining jurors individually, but the court\n\ndeclined,   stating   that   the    jurors   had   already    satisfactorily\n\nresponded to the prior day's group inquiry, and that since that\n\ntime they could have had no contact with the note-sending juror.\n\n            Yeje-Cabrera's essential claim is that the juror who sent\n\nthe note, although removed from the jury the next day, likely had\n\nexpressed her strongly felt views to the other jurors and thus\n\ntainted the jury's deliberations.            The court's response to the\n\nnote, Yeje-Cabrera argues, was inadequate.              In particular, he\n\npoints to \"peer pressure,\" and to the fact that the court had just\n\ndelivered a \"stinging rebuke\" to the jury, as factors rendering the\n\nshow of hands unreliable.          Even though the jurors unanimously\n\nindicated that they had followed the court's instructions not to\n\ndiscuss the case among themselves, he argues, the court did not do\n\nenough: under these circumstances, a juror who had not followed\n\ninstructions could not be expected to raise a hand.           He argues that\n\nthe court should have individually interviewed the juror who sent\n\nthe note and all the other members of the jury to ascertain whether\n\nthey had followed instructions.        Yeje-Cabrera further argues that\n\nthe   district   court's   method    of    handling   the    problem   was   so\n\ndeficient as to require that the conviction be vacated: he claims\n\nthat the district court could not \"do effective damage control,\"\n\nand that this court cannot engage in meaningful appellate review,\n\nbecause the district court's failure to conduct individualized\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\finquiries deprived it and us of essential information.                    Such\n\nhyperbole does not win the day.\n\n           This was a difficult situation and the trial judge acted\n\nwell within the range of permissible options.           Trial judges have a\n\nwide   latitude    in   how   to   handle   a   claim   of   potential   juror\n\nmisconduct.    See Paniagua-Ramos, 251 F.3d at 250 (\"[W]hile a trial\n\ncourt has an unflagging duty adequately to probe a nonfrivolous\n\nclaim of jury taint, the court has wide discretion to determine the\n\nscope of the resulting inquiry and the mode and manner in which it\n\nwill be conducted.\" (citations omitted)).\n\n           Here the claim of taint is not about the juror who sent\n\nthe note; she was dismissed after she said she could not continue\n\nin the case.       The question is whether she tainted the others.\n\nYeje-Cabrera draws the inference -- from the emphatic nature of the\n\njuror's note to the judge -- that the juror had disseminated her\n\nviews to the other jurors, in violation of instructions. Moreover,\n\nhe argues, her expressed views might have overridden in the other\n\njurors' minds the court's strong curative instruction about the\n\ngovernment's burden of proof.\n\n           While the posited scenario is possible, we think that\n\nsuch inferences are not reasonable.         During the show of hands, the\n\njuror who sent the note and the other jurors denied there had been\n\ndiscussions.      We acknowledge that asking jurors en masse, before\n\ntheir peers, whether they have failed to comply with the court's\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\finstructions may tend to discourage an honest affirmative response.\n\nBut   the   court    also    invited   individual    jurors    to   contact   it\n\nafterwards, and none, other than the juror who sent the note, did\n\nso.\n\n            Even if the one juror had communicated her views to the\n\nother jurors, there is also no reason to think those jurors were\n\ndissuaded from following the instructions of the judge, much less\n\nthat this somehow led jurors to penalize the defendants for their\n\ndecision not to take the stand.\n\n            There was no abuse of discretion.             Cf. United States v.\n\nRichman,    600     F.2d    286,   295-96   (1st   Cir.   1979)   (where   court\n\nsatisfied itself that other jurors had not overheard one juror's\n\npotentially improper remark and had not been discussing case among\n\nthemselves, refusal to conduct individualized inquiry of remaining\n\njurors was within court's discretion).\n\n            3. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n            At the request of his client, counsel for Pérez has\n\npresented on this direct appeal a claim for ineffective assistance\n\nof counsel.       His counsel has correctly advised Pérez that this\n\ncourt will not entertain an ineffective assistance claim on direct\n\nappeal, absent a sufficiently developed evidentiary record. United\n\nStates v. Woods, 210 F.3d 70, 74 (1st Cir. 2000).                   The record\n\nevidence here is not sufficiently developed to enable either\n\n\n\n\n                                       -20-\n\fcounsel or the court to appraise the merits of Pérez's ineffective\n\nassistance claim.\n\n             4. Drug Quantity\n\n             Olivero argues that since the jury did not attribute a\n\nspecific drug quantity to him, his conviction must be vacated. His\n\nclaim results from the jury verdict form employed here:\n\n             On the charge of conspiracy to possess cocaine\n             with intent to distribute, we find\n                  a. Rafael Yeje-Cabrera\n                        ______not guilty\n                        ___T__guilty of conspiracy involving\n                        greater than 260 K's of cocaine\n                  b. Wilfredo Perez\n                        ______not guilty\n                        ___T__guilty of conspiracy involving\n                        greater than 5 K's of cocaine\n                  . . .\n                  d. William Olivero\n                        ______not guilty\n                        ___T__guilty of conspiracy involving\n                        ______ of cocaine\n\nThe net result was that the jury did not find a specific drug\n\nquantity as to Olivero but did find he was guilty of conspiracy to\n\ndistribute cocaine.        The jury was not asked to determine the\n\nquantity of drugs involved in the conspiracy as a whole.          The court\n\ndid, however, instruct the jury that the government had to prove\n\nbeyond   a   reasonable    doubt   that   each   defendant    joined    \"this\n\nconspiracy\" -- the one charged in the indictment, a \"wholesale\"\n\nrather   than   \"retail\"   conspiracy     to   distribute    cocaine.    The\n\n\n\n\n                                   -21-\n\findictment    had    alleged   conspiracy   to   possess   with   intent   to\n\ndistribute \"more than 5 kilograms of cocaine.\"4\n\n          From this, Olivero's counsel argues that unless the jury\n\nhas found a specific quantity of drugs, a defendant cannot be\n\nguilty of conspiracy.      He bases this argument on United States v.\n\nGonzalez, 420 F.3d 111 (2d Cir. 2005).           He attributes to the case\n\na holding that drug quantity must always be pled and proved beyond\n\na reasonable doubt to a jury before there can be a conspiracy\n\nconviction.    In the absence of a jury question asking the jurors to\n\nfind the quantity of drugs involved in the conspiracy itself, he\n\nargues, that standard has not been met.\n\n          Olivero confuses issues of criminal liability with issues\n\nof sentence.        He overreads Gonzalez, which simply holds that a\n\ndefendant charged with an aggravated drug conspiracy under 21\n\nU.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A), who does not admit but rather disputes the\n\n\n     4\n       The government objected to the district court's plan to ask\nthe jury to determine the quantity of cocaine as to which each\nindividual defendant had conspired, instead of the quantity of\ncocaine involved in the conspiracy as a whole. The prosecution\nasked that the jury be required to find only the facts charged in\nthe indictment, that is, that each defendant had participated in\nthe conspiracy, and that the conspiracy as a whole sought to\npossess with intent to distribute more than five kilograms of\ncocaine. The prosecution renewed its objection after the court\ninstructed the jury. The defense attorneys did not object on the\ndrug-quantity point, and Yeje-Cabrera's attorney said he preferred\nthe court's proposition.    Olivero's attorney made some requests\nabout jury instructions, but none pertaining to the drug-quantity\nissue. After the jury was instructed, Olivero's attorney objected\nto the court's telling the jury that drug quantity was a sentencing\nissue, saying he would have preferred for the court to say that the\namount went to \"other reasons or other legal reasons.\"\n\n                                    -22-\n\frequisite drug quantity, could not be held to a guilty plea to that\n\noffense.   Id. at 115.    Rather, such a defendant's plea \"at best\n\nsupports a conviction on a lesser, unquantified drug charge, whose\n\nsentencing range is prescribed by § 841(b)(1)(C).\"           Id.\n\n           Treating 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C) as establishing a\n\ndefault statutory maximum sentence, the maximum is still 20 years.5\n\nThis is so no matter how small the amount of the cocaine which was\n\nthe subject of the conspiracy.      This court has previously affirmed\n\nthe conviction but remanded for resentencing no higher than the\n\ndefault statutory maximum of 20 years on similar facts. See United\n\nStates v. Pérez-Ruiz, 353 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2003), cert denied, 541\n\nU.S. 1005 (2004) (\"Pérez-Ruiz I\") (defendant was charged with\n\nconspiracy to distribute specific drug quantities, but jury was not\n\ninstructed that it had to find specific amounts in order to convict\n\nand there were no special verdict findings).             \"No specific drug\n\nquantity needs to be proven for a jury to convict a defendant of\n\nconspiracy to possess with intent to distribute.           It is therefore\n\nnot erroneous per se to allow a jury to find that a defendant is\n\nguilty of the crime charged but responsible for a lesser quantity\n\nof drugs than specified in the indictment.\"              United States v.\n\nGómez-Rosario,   418   F.3d   90,   104    (1st   Cir.   2005)   (citations\n\nomitted); see also id. at 103-05 (special verdict form had one\n\n\n\n     5\n       The maximum is higher if additional facts are present.           See\n21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C).\n\n                                    -23-\n\fblank for filling in guilty/not guilty and other blanks for filling\n\nin defendant's responsibility for particular drug quantity, and\n\njury    was    instructed      to    convict      only    upon    finding      that    the\n\n\"agreement      specified      in    the    indictment,      and    not    some     other\n\nagreement . . . existed\").             There is no basis here for reversing\n\nOlivero's conviction.\n\nB. Forfeiture Order: Violation of Rule 32.2(b)(3)\n\n              Yeje-Cabrera      asks       on    appeal   that     the    final     order\n\nforfeiting $5.2 million and two parcels of land be reversed because\n\nit    was   entered    after    judgment        was    entered     instead     of   being\n\nincorporated into the judgment as required by Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n32.2(b)(3).      The Rule provides: \"At sentencing -- or at any time\n\nbefore      sentencing   if    the    defendant        consents    --    the   order    of\n\nforfeiture becomes final as to the defendant and must be made a\n\npart of the sentence and be included in the judgment.\"                          Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 32.2(b)(3) (emphases added).\n\n              We reject the government's position that Rule 32.2(b)(3)\n\nwas not violated because the court told the defendant at sentencing\n\nthat it was \"allow[ing]\" the preliminary order of forfeiture to\n\nbecome final.        Cf. United States v. Melendez-Santana, 353 F.3d 93,\n\n100    (1st   Cir.    2003)    (stating         that   \"where     the    conditions     of\n\nsupervised release announced at the sentencing hearing conflict in\n\na material way with the conditions of supervised release in the\n\nwritten sentencing order, the oral conditions control\"), overruled\n\n\n                                           -24-\n\fin part on other grounds by United States v. Padilla, 415 F.3d 211,\n\n215 (1st Cir. 2005) (en banc).          The oral sentencing does not trump\n\nRule 32.2(b)(3).       See United States v. Pease, 331 F.3d 809, 814-15\n\n(11th Cir. 2003) (forfeiture, to be valid, must be included in the\n\njudgment); cf. United States v. Petrie, 302 F.3d 1280, 1284-85\n\n(11th Cir. 2002) (where forfeiture was not mentioned at sentencing\n\nand only vaguely mentioned in judgment, district court lacked\n\njurisdiction to enter preliminary forfeiture order six months after\n\nsentencing); but see United States v. Loe, 248 F.3d 449, 464 (5th\n\nCir. 2001) (where forfeiture was mentioned at oral sentencing but\n\nnot   in   written      judgment,      \"the    oral    ruling      prevails\"     over\n\nconflicting      written      order,     so    that     \"[t]he      court's      oral\n\npronouncement on forfeiture, which it issued at the sentencing\n\nhearing, consequently remains effective in the face of a contrary\n\nwritten judgment\").        There was a clear violation of the \"must be\n\nincluded in the judgment\" portion of the Rule.\n\n            The appropriate remedy for violation of the Rule depends\n\non context.      One very serious situation would be if the violation\n\nbespoke a lack of notice and opportunity for the defendant and\n\nthird parties to object to a proposed forfeiture.                   Cf. Pease, 331\n\nF.3d at 816 n.18 (oral sentencing did not include forfeiture);\n\nPetrie,    302   F.3d    at   1284     (forfeiture     was   not     mentioned    at\n\nsentencing hearing, written judgment merely stated that defendant\n\nwas   \"subject    to    forfeiture      as    cited\"   in    one    count   of   the\n\n\n                                        -25-\n\findictment, and preliminary forfeiture order was not entered until\n\nsix months after sentencing).\n\n            That is not the situation here. The forfeiture claim was\n\ncontained in the indictment, and the jury returned a special\n\nverdict    finding   that    Yeje-Cabrera        had    derived     the    property\n\n\"directly or indirectly, as a result of the conspiracy to possess\n\ncocaine    with   intent    to    distribute.\"         The    presentence    report\n\nmentions the forfeiture allegation in the indictment and states\n\nthat the jury \"returned a verdict of guilty on all counts.\"                       The\n\n\"Sentencing Options\" section of the presentence report does not,\n\nhowever, mention forfeiture.           Two months after the verdict, the\n\ngovernment moved for a preliminary order of forfeiture; the motion\n\nwas granted on February 24, 2003.             Two days later, at sentencing,\n\nthe district court stated that it was \"allow[ing] the government's\n\nrecommendation for forfeiture.\"          When the court said this, it must\n\nhave been referring to a recommendation of a final order of\n\nforfeiture, since the preliminary order had already issued.\n\n            For reasons which are unclear, no order of forfeiture was\n\nset forth in the judgment entered on March 3, or in the amended\n\njudgment   entered   on     May   9,   2003.      On    August    14,     2003,   the\n\ngovernment moved for a final order of forfeiture.                 The government\n\napparently did not realize that the \"must be included in the\n\njudgment\" requirement of Rule 32.2 had not been met, as it did not\n\nmove to correct the judgment under Rule 36.                  See Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n\n                                       -26-\n\f36 (\"After giving any notice it considers appropriate, the court\n\nmay at any time correct a clerical error in a judgment, order, or\n\nother part of the record, or correct an error in the record arising\n\nfrom oversight or omission.\").          On September 19, 2003, the court\n\nentered a final order of forfeiture.\n\n             Importantly, it appears that Yeje-Cabrera never once\n\nopposed the merits of the proposed forfeiture.                The government so\n\nrepresents, and Yeje-Cabrera does not represent to the contrary.\n\nEssentially, Yeje-Cabrera argues now that because there was a\n\nviolation    of    Rule   32.2,   he   is     entitled   to   reversal   of   the\n\nforfeiture order, which he had never opposed on the merits.                    We\n\ndisagree.6\n\n             There may be occasions when violations of Rules warrant\n\na remedy of reversal.         But the portion of Rule 32.2 which was\n\nviolated here is largely a housekeeping rule and does not itself go\n\nto any fundamental rights of defendants.\n\n             One of the primary purposes of Rule 32.2, as its history\n\nshows, is to allow for the entry of a preliminary order of\n\nforfeiture.        Before the 1996 Amendments, the predecessor Rule\n\n32(d)(2)     did   not    explicitly    provide    for   such    a   preliminary\n\n\n     6\n       We bypass the government's argument that by failing to\noppose entry of the post-judgment final order of forfeiture, at\nbest Yeje-Cabrera is entitled to plain error review. The outcome\nwould be the same here regardless of the standard of review. We do\nnote, however, that if either party had called this matter to the\nattention of the court, we are sure the court would have remedied\nthe problem under Fed. R. Crim. P. 36.\n\n                                       -27-\n\fforfeiture procedure.          In 1996, Rule 32(d)(2) was amended to\n\nprovide for the entry of a preliminary order of forfeiture after\n\nthe forfeiture verdict and after \"providing notice to the defendant\n\nand a reasonable opportunity to be heard.\"           The amendment added\n\nthat \"[a]t sentencing, a final order of forfeiture shall be made\n\npart of the sentence and included in the judgment.\"           This marks the\n\nfirst appearance of language similar to that relied upon by Yeje-\n\nCabrera.\n\n             The Advisory Committee Notes to the 1996 Amendments\n\nillustrate that the drafters were primarily concerned with enabling\n\nthe government to obtain a preliminary order of forfeiture.             The\n\nNotes cite three problems the new procedure avoids: delay in the\n\ngovernment's locating and preserving forfeited assets, delay in\n\nthird parties' ability to assert interests in the property, and the\n\nneed to resort to restraining orders to maintain the status quo.\n\nSee   Fed.   R.   Crim.   P.    32   advisory   committee's    notes   (1996\n\namendments).      The drafters do evince concern with protecting the\n\ndefendant's interests, but do so by highlighting the defendant's\n\nright to notice and an opportunity to be heard, rather than by\n\nemphasizing the written judgment requirement.         See id.\n\n             Rule 32.2 serves other efficiency interests as well, in\n\nparticular, preserving the resources of the judicial system and of\n\npotentially interested third parties. The Advisory Committee Notes\n\non Subdivision (b) of Rule 32.2 are concerned almost entirely with\n\n\n                                     -28-\n\fimproving the procedure by which the relative ownership interests\n\nof the defendant and of third parties are determined.                    See Fed. R.\n\nCrim.    P.    32.2   advisory     committee's        notes    (2000   amendments).\n\nTellingly, the Advisory Committee Notes do not focus on the written\n\njudgment requirement at all. Instead, they focus on explaining how\n\nthe Rule avoids wasteful litigation.                  The Notes discuss how the\n\ncoexistence of former Rule 31(e) with 21 U.S.C. § 853(n) and 18\n\nU.S.C.   §     1963(l)    caused      duplicative     proceedings      to    determine\n\nrelative ownership interests in property subject to forfeiture, and\n\nthey explain how the new procedure avoids that problem.\n\n               To be sure, Rule 32.2 also does serve interests of the\n\ndefendant.      In particular, the Rule ensures that all the penalties\n\nimposed on the defendant occur as part of a \"package,\" so that\n\nforfeiture is not imposed above and beyond a sentence that the\n\ncourt    had    already      determined    to    be   adequate.        The    Eleventh\n\nCircuit's observation in Pease puts the point well:\n\n               [F]orfeiture is part of the defendant's\n               sentencing package for an obvious reason. The\n               magnitude of the forfeiture may influence how\n               the court treats the other parts of the\n               package.    For example, if forfeiture is\n               sizeable, the court may impose a fine at the\n               bottom of the Sentencing Guidelines' range or,\n               if the forfeiture would render the defendant\n               impecunious, perhaps no fine at all.\n\n\nPease, 331 F.3d at 816 (discussing Rule 32, the predecessor to Rule\n\n32.2, which in this respect was similar to the current Rule).                       On\n\nthe   facts     of    this    case,    mere     failure   to    comply      with   Rule\n\n                                          -29-\n\f32.2(b)(3)'s    written   judgment    requirement      does   not   harm   this\n\ninterest   of   the   defendant.     The    district   court   included    the\n\nforfeiture at the time it orally sentenced; the purpose of avoiding\n\nunduly large sentence/forfeiture \"packages\" was served here.\n\n           This court addressed the mirror image of our problem in\n\nUnited States v. Ferrario-Pozzi, 368 F.3d 5 (1st Cir. 2004), where\n\nthe final order of judgment did include the written order of\n\nforfeiture, but defendant argued it had not been included in the\n\noral pronouncement of the sentence.           In fact, the defendant had\n\nagreed at sentencing \"that he was not contesting forfeiture itself,\n\nbut simply the amount over two million dollars,\" and he requested\n\nthat this issue be resolved at a later hearing.                     Id. at 7.\n\nFerrario-Pozzi pointed out that cases where the defendant did not\n\nreceive adequate notice that a final order of forfeiture would be\n\nentered pose different concerns than cases where the defendant knew\n\nof this fact all along.     See id. at 9.     The efficiency of the court\n\nsystem's operations may have been hurt in this case, but Yeje-\n\nCabrera was not.\n\n           As the Fifth Circuit held in Loe, 248 F.3d at 464, we\n\nfind nothing objectionable about employing a later nunc pro tunc\n\namendment to cure a mere failure of the judgment to describe a\n\nfinal order of forfeiture as required by Rule 32.2(b)(3).             This is\n\nprovided, of course, that the judge has properly addressed the\n\nforfeiture issue previously.         See id. (trial judge had included\n\n\n                                     -30-\n\fforfeiture at oral pronouncement of sentencing and had issued a\n\npreliminary written order of forfeiture); United States v. Hatcher,\n\n323 F.3d 666, 673-74 (8th Cir. 2003) (deeming omission of the\n\nforfeiture from both the sentencing and the judgment to be mere\n\nclerical error, where the district court had earlier entered a\n\npreliminary forfeiture order).          Accordingly we order amendment of\n\nthe   judgment   nunc    pro    tunc    to     include   the    final   order      of\n\nforfeiture.\n\nC. Sentencing Issues\n\n           1. Defendants' Claims\n\n           a. Apprendi/Booker -- All Defendants\n\n           All three defendants challenge their sentences on the\n\nbasis of a misunderstanding of Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466\n\n(2000), and Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296 (2004).                       Each\n\nargues that it was error for the district court to impose a\n\nsentence   on    the    basis   of     facts    found    by    the   court    by   a\n\npreponderance of the evidence, but not found by the jury beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.       In Yeje-Cabrera's case, the alleged flaw was a\n\nsentence   enhancement     under     U.S.      Sentencing     Guidelines     Manual\n\n(U.S.S.G.) § 3B1.1 based on the court's finding that he was \"the\n\norganizer, manager and leader of a large-scale drug organization\n\nincluding more than five individuals.\"             In Pérez's case, the jury\n\nstated in its special verdict form that Pérez was responsible for\n\nfive kilograms of cocaine, but the district court found that Pérez\n\n\n                                       -31-\n\fwas responsible for a drug quantity between 15 and 50 kilograms.\n\nIt also imposed a sentence enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1,\n\nbased on its finding that Pérez was a career offender.7                             In\n\nOlivero's case, the claimed error arises from the district court's\n\nfinding that Olivero was responsible for \"at least 499 grams\" of\n\ncocaine, when the jury verdict had attributed no particular drug\n\nquantity to Olivero.\n\n               These objections -- that the judge, not the jury, found\n\ncertain      facts    --   misapprehend     the   law   as   it   was   eventually\n\narticulated in United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005).                      As\n\nwe explained in United States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68 (1st\n\nCir.       2005),    the   Booker   error   \"is   not   that      a   judge   (by    a\n\n\n       7\n       It is not clear whether counsel for Pérez is also asserting\nthat the base offense level of 37 was somehow inaccurate. If so,\nthe record refutes the argument easily. The court found that Pérez\nwas a \"career offender, having had two prior convictions of either\na crime of violence or [a] controlled substance violation.\" See\nU.S.S.G. § 4B1.1(a). Under U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1(b), the offense level\nprovided by the career offender subsection or the otherwise\napplicable offense level, whichever is greater, must be applied.\nThe table in that subsection provides that if the statutory maximum\nfor the offense is life imprisonment, then the offense level is 37.\nHere, the statutory maximum was life, as provided by 21 U.S.C.\n§ 846 (conspiracy to commit an offense is punished the same as the\noffense itself) and § 841(b)(1)(A)(ii) (distribution of five\nkilograms or more of cocaine subjects the offender to a maximum\npenalty of life in prison). Therefore, the offense level was 37\nunder the career offender table, and this was greater than the\notherwise applicable offense level of 34, so it was the correct\nlevel to apply under the career offender Guideline. Under U.S.S.G.\n§ 4B1.1(b), \"[a] career offender's criminal history category in\nevery case under this subsection shall be Category VI.\" With a\ntotal offense level of 37 and a criminal history of Category VI,\nthe Guidelines range was thirty years to life in prison.\n\n\n                                       -32-\n\fpreponderance     of     the   evidence)    determined    facts   under    the\n\nGuidelines which increased a sentence beyond that authorized by the\n\njury verdict or an admission by the defendant; the error is only\n\nthat the judge did so in a mandatory Guidelines system.\"              Id. at\n\n75.\n\n            For   this    reason,   we   reject    Olivero's   argument   that\n\nbecause the jury did not attribute a specific drug quantity to him,\n\nhis sentence must be vacated.\n\n            Olivero argues in particular that, because there was no\n\nspecific drug quantity found by the jury, the \"statutory maximum\"\n\nfor him was that based on a Guidelines offense level of 12,\n\npursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c)(14) (providing for a base offense\n\nlevel of 12 where the drug quantity is less than 25 grams of\n\ncocaine).    With a base offense level of 12 and a criminal history\n\ncategory of I, the high end of the Guidelines range would have been\n\n16 months.    See United States v. Green, 346 F. Supp. 2d 259, 327\n\n(D. Mass. 2004).         But the actual statutory maximum here was 20\n\nyears.   The district court's attribution to Olivero of a specific\n\nquantity of cocaine (\"at least 499 grams\") no more invalidates his\n\nsentence than it does his conviction.             There was a period between\n\nBlakely and Booker when the district courts were forced to predict\n\nand improvise.         Some courts, as the court did here, predicted\n\nwrongly that Sixth Amendment concerns required as a remedy that\n\ncertain issues (for instance, drug quantity) be decided by a jury,\n\n\n                                     -33-\n\fnot a judge.     It is now well settled that this was wrong; the\n\nremedy was to make the Guidelines non-mandatory.         See Booker, 125\n\nS. Ct. at 756-57; Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 75.\n\n            Since Booker we have made it clear that the district\n\ncourts   may   make   drug   quantity   determinations   for   sentencing\n\npurposes:\n\n            Under the 5-4 constitutional ruling in Booker,\n            judge-made enhancements under the guidelines\n            that result in a sentence greater than the\n            sentence that could be imposed based solely on\n            the facts found by the jury do amount to Sixth\n            Amendment violations if the guidelines are\n            treated as mandatory; but under the companion\n            5-4 remedial ruling in Booker, this problem is\n            washed out by treating the guidelines as\n            advisory.    A defendant sentenced under the\n            mandatory    regime   may   be   entitled   to\n            resentencing under the advisory one . . . but\n            Booker    both    created   and    cured   the\n            constitutional error at the same time.\n\nUnited States v. Pérez-Ruiz, 421 F.3d 11, 14-15 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(\"Pérez-Ruiz II\").      We rejected the defendant's claim that \"the\n\ndistrict judge violated the Sixth Amendment by himself making the\n\ndeterminations as to drug quantity and other enhancements.\" Id. at\n\n14; see also United States v. Sanchez-Berrios, 424 F.3d 65, 80 (1st\n\nCir. 2005) (\"[A]n unadorned claim that the judge -- and not the\n\njury -- found sentencing facts, even if true, does not warrant\n\nresentencing.\" (citing United States v. Martins, 413 F.3d 139, 152\n\n(1st Cir. 2005))).     There was no reversible error in the district\n\n\n\n\n                                   -34-\n\fcourt's attribution to Olivero of at least 25 grams of cocaine.8\n\nThat is a separate matter than the government's appeal from the\n\nsentence, which we address below.\n\n            No defendant makes a plausible claim for a remand under\n\nBooker and Antonakopoulos.    Yeje-Cabrera and Olivero never filed\n\nbriefs raising a Booker/Antonakopoulos argument, so they have\n\nwaived any claim they might have had under those decisions.     See\n\nUnited States v. Vega Molina, 407 F.3d 511, 534 n.7 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).\n\n            Pérez did file a supplemental brief seeking resentencing\n\nunder Booker, but he has not shown why resentencing is justified in\n\nhis case.    He concedes that plain error review applies.   We thus\n\napply the standard that we articulated in Antonakopoulos.       See\n\nAntonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 77.\n\n\n\n\n     8\n       Olivero also challenges his sentence by claiming that the\ndistrict court abused its discretion when it imposed an upward\ndeparture of seven months. Under U.S.S.G. § 5K2.0, the sentencing\ncourt may depart where there are aggravating or mitigating\ncircumstances \"of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into\nconsideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the\nguidelines.\" U.S.S.G. § 5K2.0(a)(1) (Policy Statement). Olivero\nargues that it was error to depart on the basis of his role in the\noffense, because it was already adequately addressed under the\nGuidelines. It is clear, though, that the district court not only\ncould have, but would have, departed on the sole basis of the other\nground it cited: the extraordinary extent and danger of the\nconspiracy. Contrary to Olivero's assertion that it was just a\n\"run of the mill\" conspiracy, the evidence at trial showed that\nthis conspiracy involved a multistate network of players,\nsophisticated tactics, and record-setting quantities of cocaine.\n\n                                -35-\n\f          Pérez has not met his burden of showing a \"reasonable\n\nprobability that the district court would impose a different\n\nsentence more favorable to the defendant under the new 'advisory\n\nGuidelines' Booker regime.\"   Id. at 75.   Pérez points to nothing in\n\nthe record that would suggest that the district court would have\n\nsentenced him more leniently had it been free to do so.     Instead,\n\nhe asks this court to look outside the record -- for instance, he\n\nclaims that the trial judge made public statements condemning the\n\nGuidelines in general as too harsh -- and he ultimately disclaims\n\nany attempt to make the requisite showing under Antonakopoulos,\n\nadmitting that he \"is not claiming, per se, that the sentencing\n\ncourt might have given him a more favorable sentence had [it] not\n\nbeen for the guidelines.\"\n\n          In fact, the court stated:\n\n          There's no reason to depart downward in your\n          case. You are a career offender. You've had\n          all the chances the law allows. I have given\n          you the bottom of the guidelines.     Not that\n          that amounts to much when it comes out to\n          being a 30 year sentence.\n               This is the sentence for dealing drugs in\n          our society.   It is the sentence decreed by\n          the   people's  representatives   sitting   in\n          congress. It is a fair and just sentence.\n\nOn these facts, a remand for resentencing is not warranted.      See\n\nSanchez-Berrios, 424 F.3d at 80 (\"It is not enough for a defendant\n\nmerely to argue that his sentence might have been different had the\n\nguidelines been advisory at the time of sentencing.\"); id. (stating\n\n                                -36-\n\fthat the fact that defendant was sentenced at the bottom of the\n\nGuidelines range, \"standing alone, is manifestly insufficient to\n\nsatisfy the third element of the plain error test\").\n\n          b. The fine -- Pérez\n\n          Pérez challenges his $4 million fine on the ground that\n\nhe is indigent and has no \"potential ability\" to pay the fine in\n\nthe future, and so it was error for the court to impose it.        Pérez\n\ndid not challenge the fine in the district court, so we review for\n\nplain error.   See United States v. Peppe, 80 F.3d 19, 22 (1st Cir.\n\n1996).\n\n          Pérez   never   submitted     financial   information   before\n\nsentencing.9   At sentencing, the district court stated:\n\n               The Court imposes upon you no fine due to\n          your inability to pay a fine.     I take that\n          back. I take that back. The Court imposes\n          upon you the maximum fine under the sentencing\n          guidelines, $4 million.    I don't think you\n          have the capability of paying it, and you\n          cannot be required or any sanction levied\n          against you due to a genuine inability to pay.\n          There's a great deal of money here and if the\n          government can find any of it we'll have it\n          applied to that fine. (emphasis added)\n\n\n\n\n     9\n        The presentence report for Pérez states that \"[t]he\ndefendant did not bring the requested financial information to the\npresentence interview. As of the date of the disclosure of this\nreport, the defendant had not submitted a financial statement.\" It\nfurther states that the statutory maximum fine that could be\nimposed on Pérez, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A), was $4\nmillion, and that the Guidelines range, pursuant to U.S.S.G.\n§ 5E1.2(c)(1) and (c)(4), was $20,000 to $4 million.\n\n                                 -37-\n\f          Pérez argues that since the court found an inability to\n\npay, no fine should be imposed.\n\n          Guideline § 5E1.2(a) places the burden on the defendant\n\nto establish inability to pay a fine: \"The court shall impose a\n\nfine in all cases, except where the defendant establishes that he\n\nis unable to pay and is not likely to become able to pay any fine.\"\n\nSee also United States v.

Government's Appeal from Olivero's Sentence\n\n            The government asks that Olivero's sentence be vacated\n\nand the matter be remanded for resentencing. First, the government\n\nargues that the district court erred in holding that Apprendi\n\nprecluded   it   from   finding   a   drug   quantity   above    499   grams\n\n(particularly in the face of evidence that Olivero was responsible\n\nfor a considerably greater quantity of cocaine).                Second, the\n\ngovernment argues, the court erred in declining to follow the\n\nGuidelines in order to punish the prosecution for what the court\n\nconsidered to be impermissible fact bargaining.         Specifically, the\n\ngovernment takes issue with the court's decision to a) deny a\n\nfirearms enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(1), even though it\n\nfound that the facts warranting the enhancement had been shown by\n\na preponderance of the evidence, and b) grant a reduction in\n\nOlivero's offense level under § 3B1.2(a) for being a minimal\n\nparticipant, when it was clear that Olivero was not a minimal\n\nparticipant.\n\n            Olivero, a prime actor in the conspiracy, received only\n\na 48-month sentence in the face of a statutory maximum of 20\n\n\n\n\n                                  -40-\n\fyears.11   The overall conspiracy involved possession with intent to\n\ndistribute 260 kilograms of cocaine.\n\n            a. How the Court Arrived at Olivero's Sentence\n\n            Olivero   and   20   other   defendants    in   this   case      were\n\nindicted on December 20, 2001.       Before trial, there was a flurry of\n\nplea bargaining activity: in all, 15 of the 21 defendants pled\n\nguilty, seven \"on the very eve of trial.\"            Green, 346 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 325.\n\n            On July 10, 2002, the probation office was asked to\n\nprepare a \"pre-plea\" presentence report for Olivero.                Evidently\n\nthis judge of the district court orders such \"pre-plea\" presentence\n\nreports as a matter of course.           See id. at 279 (\"This court has\n\nburdened an already strained probation office by ordering pre-plea\n\npresentence reports in virtually every case as the best defense to\n\nillegal fact bargaining.\").        The \"pre-plea\" presentence report was\n\nprepared on October 29, 2002.         It discussed the possibility of a\n\nminimal-role    reduction    for    Olivero,   but    rejected     it   as    not\n\nwarranted on the evidence.         It did not mention that Olivero had\n\npossessed a firearm.\n\n\n\n     11\n        Because the jury convicted Olivero of conspiracy to possess\ncocaine with intent to distribute, and because the conspiracy as a\nwhole had been charged with responsibility for more than five\nkilograms of cocaine, the government originally argued in the\ndistrict court that the statutory maximum applicable to Olivero was\nlife imprisonment. See 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A). It has dropped\nthat argument on appeal, conceding that the \"default 20-year\nstatutory maximum\" applies.\n\n                                     -41-\n\f           On October 14, 2002, the U.S. Attorney sent to Olivero's\n\nattorney the plea agreement that they had negotiated, and Olivero\n\nand his attorney signed the document on October 30, 2002.             In the\n\nproposed agreement, there was no mention of a weapon or a weapons\n\nenhancement, and the government agreed not to oppose a minimal\n\nparticipant downward adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3B1.2(a).\n\nAt the time, the government was also negotiating agreements with a\n\nnumber of co-defendants.\n\n           The proposed deal fell through on November 1, 2002, just\n\nbefore trial was to begin on November 4.       Olivero withdrew from the\n\ndeal when, at the hearing on acceptance of the plea, the court\n\ninformed him that a plea would likely result in his immediate\n\nremand to custody.   Green, 346 F. Supp. 2d at 325.          Olivero went to\n\ntrial.   Switching from its position during the plea agreement, the\n\ngovernment   presented   evidence    at    trial   tending    to   show   that\n\nOlivero's role in the offense was more than minimal and connecting\n\nOlivero to a handgun whose ownership was in dispute.                The jury\n\nreturned its verdict, finding Olivero guilty, on December 12, 2002.\n\n           The post-conviction presentence report, dated April 10,\n\n2003, states that a handgun was found in Olivero's bedroom, along\n\nwith ammunition, 14.4 grams of cocaine, a scale, and a money-\n\ncounting machine.    Under U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(1), this meant a two-\n\n\n\n\n                                    -42-\n\flevel enhancement applied.12 The Probation Office took the position\n\nthat   an   adjustment   for   minimal    role   in   the   offense   was   not\n\nwarranted.\n\n            The court first found Olivero responsible for \"at least\n\n499 grams\" of cocaine, which led to a base offense level of 24.\n\nThe court explained that because the jury left Olivero's drug\n\nquantity space blank on its verdict form, the jury must have found\n\nthat the prosecution failed to prove as to him a quantity of 500\n\ngrams or more beyond a reasonable doubt.            The court further stated\n\nthat under Apprendi, a judge could not find a higher drug quantity\n\non his own, by a mere preponderance of evidence.\n\n            Second, the court found that Olivero in fact possessed a\n\ngun in furtherance of the crime, but it declined to impose a\n\nsentence enhancement, citing what it viewed as the government's\n\nimproper    fact-bargaining,    that     is,   an   improper   inconsistency\n\nbetween the government's willingness to ignore the gun enhancement\n\nas part of a plea agreement and its request for the gun enhancement\n\nafter trial.     The district court emphasized that the \"pre-plea\"\n\npresentence report did not mention a firearm.               The court stated\n\n\n\n     12\n        Under the Guidelines, if the defendant's offense involved\npossession of a dangerous weapon, his offense level is to be\nincreased by two levels. See U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(1). Application\nNote 3 to this Guideline elaborates: \"The enhancement for weapon\npossession reflects the increased danger of violence when drug\ntraffickers possess weapons. The adjustment should be applied if\nthe weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the\nweapon was connected with the offense.\"\n\n                                   -43-\n\fthat the prosecution knew that a weapon had been found in Olivero's\n\nroom \"before the preplea was entered into,\" and rejected the\n\nprosecution's argument that the facts necessary to prove gun\n\npossession became clearer as the prosecution prepared for and\n\nultimately conducted the trial.13      As a result, the court punished\n\nthe prosecution by refusing to enhance the sentence, even though\n\nthe   April    10,    2003   post-conviction   presentence    report   had\n\nrecommended     the    two-level   U.S.S.G.    §   2D1.1(b)(1)    firearm\n\nenhancement.\n\n          Third, the court addressed Olivero's role in the offense.\n\nIf a defendant is a \"minimal\" participant in criminal activity, his\n\noffense level is to be decreased by four levels.             See U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 3B1.2(a).    If he is a \"minor\" participant, the reduction is two\n\nlevels, and if his role is somewhere in between, the reduction is\n\nthree levels.    Id. § 3B1.2.      The court awarded Olivero a 4-point\n\nminimal-role reduction.       It found that the government had offered\n\nto recommend this reduction as part of the proposed plea agreement\n\nand, in the court's view, had engaged in improper fact-bargaining\n\n\n\n\n     13\n        The government explained that once the intense period of\nplea bargaining was over and Olivero had rejected the plea, it had\nfocused much more intently on the evidence it would present at\ntrial. The government interviewed more witnesses and it became\nclearer to it that the weapon had been there, under Olivero's bed,\nnot for other reasons, but in connection with the cocaine and drug\nproceeds in his closet.\n\n                                   -44-\n\fby taking different positions.14   In essence, the court stated, the\n\nprosecution's change of position had burdened Olivero's right to\n\ninsist on a jury trial.\n\n          Based   on   these   calculations,    Olivero's   Guidelines\n\nsentencing range was 33 to 41 months.       The court departed upwards\n\nby seven months because Olivero was \"in with these people\" and not\n\n\"some bit player\" and because the conspiracy was extraordinarily\n\nextensive and dangerous -- facts it considered not sufficiently\n\nreflected in the Guidelines range.\n\n          The defendant had not advanced the arguments used by the\n\ndistrict court to deny the gun enhancement or to grant the minimal\n\nparticipant downward departure.         From what we can tell of the\n\nrecord, Olivero did not allege that the prosecution was retaliating\n\nagainst him for insisting on trial, much less offer any evidence in\n\nsupport of such a claim.       Instead, the court raised the fact-\n\nbargaining issue sua sponte.    It also placed the initial burden on\n\nthe prosecution to explain itself.15\n\n\n     14\n        The court's comments at sentencing did not make entirely\nclear whether it considered the minimal-role reduction issue to be\none of fact bargaining. The court's post-sentencing memorandum,\nhowever, suggests that that is indeed how the court viewed the\nmatter.    See Green, 346 F. Supp. 2d at 330 (stating that\ngovernment's denial that there was fact bargaining with respect to\nOlivero's role was \"disingenuous\").\n\n     15\n        Olivero did object to the presentence report, claiming that\nthe evidence supported a minimal role adjustment and that the\ngovernment had earlier acknowledged as much. He did not hint at\nany prosecutorial vindictiveness, emphasizing instead the evidence\nitself. As for the gun, Olivero only objected on the basis that\n\n                                 -45-\n\f              On June 18, 2004, after the defendants had appealed their\n\nconvictions and jurisdiction over their cases was in this court,\n\nthe district court, sua sponte, published an 80-page advisory\n\nopinion (which it styled as a sentencing memorandum) in which it\n\nexpanded upon its reasons for sanctioning the government.                      See\n\nGreen, 346 F. Supp. 2d 259.\n\n              b. Analysis of District Court's Rationale\n\n              i. Apprendi\n\n              The   district   court    post-Booker      may   determine      drug\n\nquantity      for   purposes   of      sentence    enhancements      under     the\n\nGuidelines.      The district court's Apprendi rationale for limiting\n\nits consideration of drug quantity was simply a wrong guess as to\n\nthe direction the law would take.               The district court was not\n\n\"constrained\" by the jury's verdict, as it thought it was, to\n\nfinding less than 500 grams of cocaine.              Instead, it could (and\n\nshould) have found Olivero responsible for the amount of cocaine\n\nestablished by a preponderance of the evidence against him --\n\nthough   of    course,   the   ultimate       sentence   may   not   exceed    the\n\n\n\n\nthe weapon did not belong to him and that the evidence did not\nsupport   the   firearm   enhancement,   without   mentioning   the\ngovernment's earlier position -- much less attributing any improper\nmotive to the government. At sentencing, Olivero's attorney simply\nfollowed the court's lead, expressing agreement with the court's\nview that the government knew all along about the gun.          The\nattorney then raised the prosecution's earlier support for the\nminimal role reduction, again failing to allege any sort of\nimproper motive or vindictiveness.\n\n                                       -46-\n\fstatutory maximum of 20 years.        That alone is reason to vacate the\n\nsentence and to remand.\n\n           We go on to address the government's claims of Guidelines\n\nand statutory error.       See Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 76.\n\n           ii. Fact Bargaining\n\n           The district court offered three rationales for its\n\nreduction of Olivero's sentence as a punishment of the prosecution\n\nfor \"unconstitutional\" or \"illegal\" fact bargaining.               The first\n\nrationale was that the defendant's right to trial by jury was\n\nimpermissibly burdened by the government's change in position on\n\nthe firearm enhancement and minimal role adjustment between plea\n\nbargaining and trial.        The second was that the punishment was\n\njustified because the government somehow deceived the court.               The\n\nthird was that the Guidelines prohibited the government from doing\n\nwhat it did and the appropriate sanction was to give the defendant\n\na lower sentence.\n\n           The court was attempting to address some aspects of the\n\npre-Booker     mandatory    guidelines       system   which   it   considered\n\nparticularly    unfair     and   to   address   the   power   given   to   the\n\nprosecution by the Guidelines.        The court is also passionate about\n\nprotecting the right to trial by jury.                That the court felt\n\nstrongly is evidenced by the fact that it acted sua sponte:\n\nOlivero did not seek a reduction in his sentence on any of these\n\ngrounds.\n\n\n                                      -47-\n\f          Booker's rendering of the Guidelines advisory (subject to\n\nrestraints for reasonableness) may alleviate some of the concerns\n\nwhich motivated the court.    In this case, however, none of the\n\ndistrict court's rationales justify the sentence it imposed.\n\n          (a) Fact Bargaining and the Right to a Jury Trial\n\n          The term \"fact bargaining\" has been used loosely to cover\n\na variety of situations, from affirmative misrepresentations to a\n\ncourt to more benign agreements by counsel to base sentencing on\n\nother factors.   Fact bargaining may arise when there are different\n\nviews of the facts, counsels' ability to prove them, and their\n\nconsequences.    See, e.g., Sarner, \"Fact Bargaining\" Under the\n\nSentencing Guidelines: The Role of the Probation Department, 8 Fed.\n\nSent. R. 328, 1996 WL 671569, at *2 (\"Counsel for both sides must\n\nassess their prospects for success before a jury, based on a wide\n\nvariety of conflicting factors that develop during the government's\n\ninvestigation and as available defenses.    That the truth appears\n\nsomewhere in between, after the dust has settled, is a world view\n\nshared by most criminal practitioners. . . . The basic assumption\n\nbehind plea and fact bargaining is that criminal conduct, like\n\nhuman behavior in other contexts, is never black and white.\").\n\n          Many of the district court's objections are to the\n\ninevitable artifacts and consequences of plea bargains.       Those\n\nconsequences have been accepted as beneficial to society and raise\n\nno constitutional concerns.   Plea bargaining is an essential part\n\n\n                                -48-\n\fof our criminal justice system and is \"a highly desirable part for\n\nmany reasons.\"      Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 261 (1971);\n\naccord Blackledge v. Allison, 431 U.S. 63, 71 (1977).            Plea\n\nbargaining takes place between the prosecution and the defense, and\n\ndoes not involve the court.\n\n          There are very few rules imposed on the prosecution as to\n\nplea bargaining with the defense, save that it may not coerce a\n\nplea.   For example, Rule 11(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal\n\nProcedure, which governs \"Plea Agreement Procedure,\" \"says next to\n\nnothing on how plea negotiations are to be carried out\" and \"does\n\nnot reach the question of what the attorney for the government and\n\nthe attorney for the defendant can say to each other.\"          1A C.\n\nWright, Federal Practice and Procedure § 175.1 (3d ed. 1999)\n\n(discussing former Rule 11(e), predecessor to Rule 11(c)).\n\n          While the government may not coerce a defendant into an\n\ninvoluntary plea, the government has a wide latitude in how it\n\nreaches a plea.16    See id.   For example, the prosecutor may insist,\n\nas a condition of a plea, that the defendant waive all appellate\n\n\n\n     16\n        The government also has wide latitude in investigating and\nprosecuting crimes.    Cf. United States v. Bezanson-Perkins, 390\nF.3d 34, 36 (1st Cir. 2004) (in context of defendant's challenge to\nhis conditional guilty plea, rejecting theory that \"a defendant who\nhas given a valid Miranda waiver may seek to suppress his later\nvoluntary and uncoerced statements to the police on the grounds\nthat (arguably) misleading statements by the police invalidated his\nMiranda waiver\"); United States v. Byram, 145 F.3d 405, 408 (1st\nCir. 1998) (with respect to obtaining confessions, \"trickery is not\nautomatically coercion\").\n\n                                   -49-\n\frights.   See United States v. Teeter, 257 F.3d 14, 21-23 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).    The prosecution may insist on a waiver of rights under\n\nBrady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963).   Under some circumstances,\n\nthe prosecution may refuse to disclose certain kinds of exculpatory\n\nmaterial to the defendant in the course of plea bargaining.    See\n\nUnited States v. Ruiz, 536 U.S. 622, 633 (2002).        And if the\n\nnegotiations are not successful, due process is not violated if the\n\nprosecutor carries out threats made during the negotiations that\n\nthe defendant will be reindicted on a more serious charge which\n\nwill bring higher penalties. Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357,\n\n365 (1978).\n\n           Defendants who plead guilty will receive a benefit in\n\nsentencing over those who do not, in both charge bargaining and\n\nfact bargaining situations.    Because they benefit, they neither\n\nhave any constitutional claim nor have any interest in asserting a\n\nclaim that their agreement is unconstitutional, unless the plea is\n\ninvoluntary.17   See id. at 363 (\"Plea bargaining flows from 'the\n\n\n     17\n        Commentators have raised as a possible infirmity of fact\nbargaining that a defendant would receive an unduly lenient\nsentence because the government did not fully disclose the facts.\nSuch circumstances, of course, benefit defendants, so there is no\nconcern about intrusion on a defendant's constitutional rights.\nSee generally Bowman, To Tell the Truth: The Problem of\nProsecutorial \"Manipulation\" of Sentencing Facts, 8 Fed.

The   law   long   ago\n\ndetermined there was nothing unconstitutional or illegal about any\n\n\"burden on trial rights\" caused by such a differential.                  \"While\n\nconfronting a defendant with the risk of more severe punishment\n\nclearly    may    have    a     'discouraging    effect   on   the   defendant's\n\nassertion of his trial rights, the imposition of these difficult\n\nchoices [is] an inevitable' -- and permissible -- 'attribute of any\n\nlegitimate system which tolerates and encourages the negotiation of\n\npleas.'\"   Id. at 364 (quoting Chaffin v.

See North Carolina\n\nv. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 725 (1969).                But the Pearce line of\n\ndecisions deals with circumstances different from Olivero's case\n\nand arises in the context of 1) resentencing in a second trial\n\nafter   the    defendant     has   obtained   a    new   trial    by   appeal   or\n\ncollateral attack or 2) resentencing after the defendant has\n\nsuccessfully withdrawn a guilty plea.             See Pearce, 395 U.S. at 725\n\n(\"Due process of law, then, requires that vindictiveness against a\n\ndefendant for having successfully attacked his first conviction\n\n\n                                      -52-\n\fmust play no part in the sentence he receives after a new trial.\");\n\nSmith, 490 U.S. at 795.\n\n            The Supreme Court has said that how the government acts\n\nduring plea bargaining raises no vindictiveness concerns, but only\n\nconcerns    of   whether   the   plea   was     voluntary.18      Indeed,    in\n\nBordenkircher,    the   Court    held   that    the    due   process   concerns\n\nexpressed   in   the    Pearce   line   of     cases   about   punishment   or\n\nretaliation are simply not present in a plea bargaining situation.\n\n\"[I]n the 'give-and-take' of plea bargaining, there is no such\n\nelement of punishment or retaliation so long as the accused is free\n\nto accept or reject the prosecution's offer.\"                434 U.S. at 363.\n\nHere, the defendant withdrew from the plea agreement, so the\n\nknowing and voluntary test under Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238,\n\n242 (1969), does not come into play.19\n\n\n     18\n        While Bordenkircher involved imposition of a greater charge\nand not a greater sentence recommendation on the defendant's\nrejection of the plea agreement, the Supreme Court said that the\nhigher charge was functionally equivalent to a sentencing\nrecommendation scenario.     See Bordenkircher, 434 U.S. at 363\n(\"Indeed, acceptance of the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining\nnecessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty plea is\ninvoluntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end\nresult of the bargaining process. By hypothesis, the plea may have\nbeen induced by promises of a recommendation of a lenient sentence\nor a reduction of charges, and thus by fear of the possibility of\na greater penalty upon conviction after a trial.\").\n\n     19\n       Even when a guilty plea is at issue, this court has rejected\narguments that pressure to enter a plea is sufficient to render the\nplea involuntary. See, e.g., United States v. Mescual-Cruz, 387\nF.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2004) (stating with respect to package plea\narrangements, where \"the prosecutor offers a benefit or detriment\nto all (the defendant and third parties) in order to persuade the\n\n                                    -53-\n\f          Even assuming there is, post-Bordenkircher, some role for\n\na vindictiveness analysis in this situation, see United States v.\n\nGoodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 380 n.12, 384 (1982); Smith, 490 U.S. at\n\n802-03, the concern is with prosecutorial vindictiveness, not with\n\nthe possibility that defendants face some burden on the right to\n\ntrial in the form of a risk of a higher sentence.   See Blackledge\n\nv. Perry, 417 U.S. 21, 27-28 (1974); cf. Johnson v. Vose, 927 F.2d\n\n10 (1st Cir. 1991).   The district court focused on burden on a\n\ndefendant's trial rights and did not find vindictiveness.   Indeed,\n\nthere was no basis for a conclusion either that Olivero's rights to\n\ntrial were burdened or that he was the subject of vindictiveness.20\n\n\nentire group of defendants to plead guilty,\" that there is a risk\nthat \"there may be a family relationship between two defendants\nwhich leads one defendant to involuntarily sacrifice his own best\ninterests for those of a family member (or perhaps both family\nmembers to involuntarily sacrifice themselves) in a belief that the\npackage deal will benefit the other\"); id. at 7-8 (\"As to this . .\n. risk, there is a distinction to be drawn. The concern of the law\nis for voluntariness. 'If a defendant elects to sacrifice himself\n[to protect someone close to him] that is his choice, and he cannot\nreverse it after he is dissatisfied with his sentence, or with\nother subsequent developments.'\" (quoting United States v. Buckley,\n847 F.2d 991, 1000 n.6 (1st Cir. 1988))); see also Buckley, 847\nF.2d at 1000 n.6 (rejecting argument that where the government\n\"promises lenient treatment of a pleading defendant's family\nmember,\" the plea bargain is per se substantively unfair).\n\n     20\n        In Goodwin, additional charges were brought after the\ndefendant rejected a guilty plea and demanded a jury trial.\nGoodwin, 457 U.S. at 370-71. The Supreme Court's rationale for\nrejecting a presumption of vindictiveness in that case is equally\napplicable in this context:\n          There is good reason to be cautious before\n          adopting    an  inflexible   presumption   of\n          prosecutorial vindictiveness in a pretrial\n          setting.   In the course of preparing a case\n\n                               -54-\n\fA defendant simply has no right to a sentence, after trial, that is\n\nas lenient as a sentence he could have had earlier in a plea\n\nbargain.   See United States v. McMillian, 583 F.2d 1061, 1063 (8th\n\nCir. 1978) (\"Appellant's claim, is, in essence, that a trial court\n\nis bound by the most favorable offer as to sentence made by the\n\nprosecutor during the course of plea negotiations, regardless of\n\nwhether that offer is accepted or rejected by the defendant.   This\n\nclaim is fatuous.\").\n\n           (b) Deception of the Court\n\n           The district court had a separate set of concerns -- that\n\nthe prosecution provide it with accurate information for sentencing\n\npurposes, both during the hearing on the plea and at sentencing\n\nafter the trial.   The court was disturbed because during the plea\n\n\n\n          for   trial,   the  prosecutor   may   uncover\n          additional information that suggests a basis\n          for further prosecution or he simply may come\n          to realize that information possessed by the\n          State has a broader significance.      At this\n          stage of the proceedings, the prosecutor's\n          assessment of the proper extent of prosecution\n          may not have crystallized. In contrast, once\n          a trial begins -- and certainly by the time a\n          conviction has been obtained -- it is much\n          more likely that the State has discovered and\n          assessed all of the information against an\n          accused and has made a determination, on the\n          basis of that information, of the extent to\n          which he should be prosecuted. Thus, a change\n          in the charging decision made after an initial\n          trial is completed is much more likely to be\n          improperly motivated than is a pretrial\n          decision.\nId. at 381.\n\n                                -55-\n\fbargaining process no mention was made to it or to the probation\n\noffice of the firearm in Olivero's bedroom.21            Of course, it was\n\nboth the prosecution and the defense which kept silent.\n\n            The district court felt its position was justified by the\n\nGuidelines Policy Statement on Stipulations set forth at § 6B1.4,\n\nwhich provides:\n\n            (a) A plea agreement may be accompanied by a\n            written stipulation of facts relevant to\n            sentencing. Except to the extent that a party\n            may be privileged not to disclose certain\n            information, stipulations shall:\n                 (1) set forth the relevant facts and\n                 circumstances of the actual offense\n                 conduct and offender characteristics;\n                 (2) not contain misleading facts; and\n                 (3) set forth with meaningful specificity\n                 the reasons why the sentencing range\n                 resulting from the proposed agreement is\n                 appropriate.\n\nU.S.S.G. § 6B1.4; see also Green, 346 F. Supp. 2d at 278 n.69\n\n(citing U.S.S.G. § 6B1.4(a)(2) & cmt.); id. at 328 n. 363 (same).\n\n            It is likely that the policy statements in Chapter Six of\n\nthe Guidelines Manual, like those in Chapter Seven, are advisory,\n\nnot mandatory.     See Ellis v. U.S. Dist. Court (In re Ellis), 356\n\nF.3d    1198,   1214-15   (9th   Cir.   2004)   (en   banc)   (Kozinski,   J.,\n\nconcurring) (arguing that the policy statements in Chapter Six of\n\n\n\n       21\n        The minimal-role reduction issue was qualitatively\ndifferent.   There was no lack of notice to the court or the\nprobation office.    The probation office itself had sufficient\ninformation to conclude in its pre-plea PSR that a minimal role\nadjustment was unwarranted. The court had this information before\nit at both the plea and the sentencing stages.\n\n                                    -56-\n\fthe Guidelines Manual are only \"hortatory,\" in part because Chapter\n\nSix, like Chapter Seven, \"is made up entirely of policy statements\n\nand their commentary\" and \"contains no guidelines\"); United States\n\nv.

Treating the policy statement\n\nas advisory recognizes the difficulty of enforcement of any such\n\nrule. In any event, the policy statement provides no justification\n\nfor a court to sentence a defendant on any basis other than the\n\nfacts before it, much less does it provide a justification for a\n\ncourt to disregard the facts before it as a \"remedy\" for the\n\ngovernment's earlier failure to provide all the facts.\n\n          The proposition, implicit in the court's view, that\n\nsentencing would be better if there were utter candor and complete\n\ndisclosure   as   to    all   points   by     the    prosecution      is   itself\n\nproblematic.      Counsel     should   not    affirmatively     misstate     the\n\nmaterial facts at sentencing. See United States v. Casas, 425 F.3d\n\n23, 2005 U.S. App. LEXIS 21960, at *35-41 (1st Cir. 2005).                 Still,\n\nthere is a line, admittedly ambiguous, between an affirmative\n\nmisrepresentation      of   facts   presented       at   sentencing    and   how\n\nprosecutors (and defendants) handle unclear or less provable facts.\n\nSee Gardner & Rifkind, A Basic Guide to Plea Bargaining Under the\n\nFederal Sentencing Guidelines, 7 Crim. Just. 14, 16 (Summer 1992)\n\n(\"The stipulation cannot contain misleading facts. . . . Where\n\n\n                                    -57-\n\ffacts are unclear or unascertainable, the parties may agree on some\n\nform of them without further justification or explanation to the\n\ncourt.\" (citation omitted) (citing U.S.S.G. § 6B1.4(a)(2))).\n\n            Even    if    the   prosecutor   knew   and   could   prove   a   gun\n\nenhancement at the time of the plea bargain, that fact would not\n\nmake a difference to our analysis.           No misrepresentation was made;\n\nrather, there was an omission, helpful to the defendant, which was\n\nan implicit part of the bargain.               Rule 11(c)(1)(B) expressly\n\ncontemplates that the attorney for the government can agree with\n\nthe defendant's request that a sentencing factor does or does not\n\napply, though this is not binding on the court.             See Fed. R. Crim.\n\nP. 11(c)(1)(B).      It was under that rule that Olivero's plea was\n\ntendered.       If the defendant and the government have agreed on a\n\nsentence free of a possible enhancement, there is a significant\n\nquestion as to why they should be burdened with an obligation to\n\ndisclose the evidence supporting the enhancement at a plea hearing.\n\nThe obligation imposed by the Rule is to \"disclose the plea\n\nagreement.\"      Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(2).\n\n            A    system    of    mandatory   disclosure     of    all   possible\n\ninformation at a plea hearing would not usually help defendants.\n\nMoreover, the costs of monitoring compliance with such a mandatory\n\ndisclosure system are high, and many of the efficiencies created by\n\nplea bargaining would be lost.         It would also lead to the blurring\n\nof roles.    After all, the federal rules prohibit involvement by a\n\n\n                                      -58-\n\ftrial judge in plea bargaining.   This is true whether through the\n\nfront door or the back.       See Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1) (\"An\n\nattorney for the government and the defendant's attorney . . . may\n\ndiscuss and reach a plea agreement. The court must not participate\n\nin these discussions.\"); cf. 1A C. Wright, Federal Practice and\n\nProcedure § 175.1 (3d ed. 1999) (\"That the defendant has accepted\n\na bargain proposed by the prosecutor creates no constitutional\n\nright to have the bargain specifically enforced.   'A plea bargain\n\nstanding alone is without constitutional significance . . . .'\"\n\n(quoting Mabry v. Johnson, 467 U.S. 504, 507-08 (1984))).       In\n\nshort, what happened here involved the artifacts of a system which\n\nis well accepted.   While Congress and the Supreme Court could have\n\nchosen to structure matters differently, they have not.\n\n            The district court was correct to condemn any deception\n\nof the court.22   But here, no claim of deception of the court is\n\npossible.   The court, at the time of sentencing, did have all the\n\nfacts before it on which to impose a sentence, and Olivero had fair\n\n\n\n     22\n        In rare instances, the doctrine of fraud on the court will\nwarrant remedial action. See Herring v. United States, 424 F.3d\n384, 386-87 (3d Cir. 2005) (\"[A] determination of fraud on the\ncourt may be justified only by 'the most egregious misconduct\ndirected to the court itself,' and . . . it 'must be supported by\nclear, unequivocal and convincing evidence.'\" (quoting In re\nCoordinated Pretrial Proceedings in Antibiotic Antitrust Actions,\n538 F.2d 180, 195 (8th Cir. 1976))); Geo. P. Reintjes Co. v. Riley\nStoker Corp., 71 F.3d 44, 48 (1st Cir. 1995) (stating that the\n\"fraud cognizable to maintain an untimely independent attack upon\na valid and final judgment has long been regarded as requiring more\nthan common law fraud\").\n\n                                -59-\n\fnotice of the issues.   The prosecution had put on evidence at trial\n\nshowing Olivero's ownership of the gun; Olivero in turn had pointed\n\nthe finger at another defendant.     The evidence was reviewed in the\n\npost-conviction presentence report, with Olivero objecting to the\n\nsuggestion that he owned the gun and the probation office defending\n\nits stance.   At sentencing, ownership of the gun was discussed yet\n\nagain. The same abundance of evidence and debate characterized the\n\nissue of Olivero's role in the offense, culminating in the court's\n\nconclusion that Olivero was assuredly not \"some bit player\" or\n\n\"casual hanger-on,\" but rather was \"in with these people.\"           There\n\ncan be no suggestion that at the time of sentencing, the government\n\nwas deceiving the court by hiding evidence of any sort, whether\n\ninculpatory or exculpatory.23   The prosecution does not argue that\n\nit has a right to lie to a court and it did not do so here.\n\n          (c)   Fact    Bargaining   and   Other   Provisions   of     the\n\n          Guidelines\n\n          The court also referred to other provisions of the\n\nGuidelines themselves as imposing an obligation on the government\n\nto disclose all information at the stage a court is considering a\n\nplea and not to change its position thereafter.      This misreads the\n\n\n     23\n        There is an obligation imposed on the district courts to\nsentence based on all information in the record which is not false\nor materially incorrect. See United States v. Tavano, 12 F.3d 301,\n305 (1st Cir. 1993).     As Tavano noted, the Federal Rules of\nCriminal Procedure are designed to procure such information. Id.\nThere is no possible argument here that there was a violation of\nthose rules.\n\n                                 -60-\n\fGuidelines.      One argument from the Sentencing Guidelines is that\n\n§ 1B1.3 (\"Relevant Conduct\") specifies that the base offense level\n\nand adjustments be based on \"all acts and omissions committed,\n\naided,    abetted,         counseled,    commanded,       induced,      procured,     or\n\nwillfully caused by the defendant\" and \"all harm that resulted\n\nfrom\" those acts.           U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3(a)(1)(A), (3).                There is no\n\nclaim that the government did not provide such information at\n\nsentencing.        Ironically,        the      district       court   sanctioned      the\n\ngovernment because it did advance exactly such evidence of relevant\n\nconduct at sentencing.           By its terms, U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3 concerns\n\nwhat    the   court    should    do     with    the    information     before    it    at\n\nsentencing and does not create a set of sanctions against the\n\ngovernment.\n\n              The other Guidelines concern arises from Application Note\n\n1 to U.S.S.G. § 1B1.8 (\"Use of Certain Information\"), which simply\n\nmakes it clear that that particular Guideline does not authorize\n\nthe government to withhold information from the court.                           In any\n\ncase,    there   is    no    evidence    here     that    Olivero     provided     self-\n\nincriminating information that the prosecution withheld from the\n\ncourt, so § 1B1.8 is inapplicable.\n\n              (d) Summary\n\n              The prosecution's conduct here transgressed no norm,\n\nconstitutional        or    legal.      There    was     no   cause   to   punish     the\n\nprosecution at all.          We defer until some other case the question of\n\n\n                                          -61-\n\fwhether a district court may ever reduce a defendant's sentence as\n\na sanction against the government for its conduct in earlier\n\nnegotiating a plea which is not accepted.                But we do note that the\n\nsentencing objectives set by the statute, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2),\n\nrefer    to   punishment     of    the    offender,      deterrence   of    crime,\n\nprotection of the public, and rehabilitation.\n\n              The sentencing of Olivero is vacated and the matter is\n\nremanded to the district court.            Olivero thus will be resentenced\n\nin a post-Booker regime in which the Guidelines are no longer\n\nmandatory.      We have reversed each of the rationales relied on by\n\nthe district court, in the government's sentencing appeal, as a\n\nmatter   of    law.   This    means       that   any   reliance   upon     them   at\n\nresentencing would be inherently unreasonable.                See Booker, 125 S.\n\nCt. at 765-66.\n\n                                  III.

The conspiracy distributed over 260 kilograms of cocaine. Yeje-Cabrera was also convicted of attempted possession with intent to distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1) and of bribery of a federal agent in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 201(b). These men, and others, distributed truckloads full of cocaine obtained from two Mexican suppliers; the drugs were driven from the Southwest to Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and New York. Yeje-Cabrera, of Westport, Massachusetts, was a principal in the operation and received a life sentence and a fine of $16 million. Yeje-Cabrera was also ordered to forfeit $5.2 million and two parcels of real property. P&#233;rez helped to distribute the cocaine and was an agent for Yeje-Cabrera. He was sentenced to thirty years' imprisonment and fined $4 million. Olivero, who lived in New York, collected the money, distributed cocaine, and assisted with the shipments. By contrast with the thirty-year sentence for P&#233;rez, Olivero was sentenced to 48 months' imprisonment, followed by five years of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yeje-Cabrera attacks his conviction and the forfeiture order. P&#233;rez attacks his conviction through a premature ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Olivero attacks his conviction. All three defendants attack their sentences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government was also unhappy with the sentence imposed on Olivero and has cross-appealed. It is the government's appeal which raises the most significant issues in the case. In order to sanction the government for what it considered to be impermissible \"fact bargaining,\" the district court declined to follow the Sentencing Guidelines. This was error. The fact bargaining was the government's willingness during earlier unsuccessful plea negotiations to recommend a lower sentence when the facts known to it at the time, or so the court found, justified a higher sentence. The court declined to give a warranted firearms enhancement and did give an unwarranted minimal-role reduction. The court also concluded, mistakenly, that its role as a fact finder with respect to drug quantity for sentencing purposes had been written out of the Sentencing Guidelines by the decision in <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm all three convictions and the sentences of Yeje-Cabrera and P&#233;rez. We vacate Olivero's sentence and remand it to the district court for re-sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Statement of Facts and Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yeje-Cabrera was a leader of a conspiracy to ship cocaine from the Southwest to various states in the Northeast, where it was sold. P&#233;rez assisted with the distribution of cocaine. Olivero assisted with the collection of money and the distribution and shipping of cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two seizures of tractor-trailers full of cocaine provide the bookends for this case. In April of 2001, after using a camera to conduct surveillance of a parking lot in New York City, agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) seized a tractor-trailer containing over 300 kilograms of cocaine and over $400,000 in cash. The agents found a cellular telephone inside that contained telephone numbers for Yeje-Cabrera and Olivero. DEA agents then conducted surveillance of Yeje-Cabrera's home in Westport, Massachusetts via a hidden camera in a birdhouse, but Yeje-Cabrera discovered the camera and realized that he was under surveillance. Some time later, the DEA agents applied for and received permission to conduct electronic surveillance of Yeje-Cabrera's phone line. This initial wiretap application was followed by others seeking permission to conduct surveillance on multiple phone lines belonging to Yeje-Cabrera and another suspect. All were allowed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 2001, the INS<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> initiated removal proceedings in Boston against Yeje-Cabrera and detained him. He reacted by bribing an INS agent to terminate the proceedings and, in a series of recorded conversations, offering to pay another bribe for information regarding the drug investigation. Yeje-Cabrera was released on his own recognizance and resumed his drug business. P&#233;rez and Olivero, with Yeje-Cabrera, continued to arrange for and conduct the shipment of, payment for, and distribution of cocaine. Meanwhile, DEA agents were monitoring Yeje-Cabrera's phone lines and attempting to engage in other forms of surveillance. The agents prepared to move in on the operation on December 8, 2001, when Yeje-Cabrera and his associates were slated to receive a large shipment of cocaine near New Bedford, Massachusetts. DEA agents and state police were out in force that morning, searching for the participants in the anticipated delivery. As it happened, the drugs came to them: the ill-fated driver of the tractor-trailer, instead of making his delivery, accidentally backed into a state trooper's cruiser. Law enforcement agents seized the tractor-trailer and discovered that it contained 260 kilograms of cocaine. That seizure has the dubious distinction of being the largest drug seizure in Massachusetts history.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The conspiracy continued to receive and distribute cocaine for a short while longer. Finally, on December 21, 2001, officers arrested Yeje-Cabrera, P&#233;rez, and several other conspirators. Olivero ultimately turned himself in.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All three defendants were charged in the December 20, 2001 indictment with conspiracy to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A)(ii), and 846. Yeje-Cabrera was also charged with two additional crimes: attempted possession with intent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A)(ii), and 846, and bribery of a federal agent, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 201(b). The indictment charged that all defendants held certain real property, vehicles, and currency which were subject to criminal forfeiture under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before trial, Yeje-Cabrera unsuccessfully moved to suppress the evidence obtained as a result of the various wiretaps. He argued that the affidavits submitted in support of the electronic surveillance applications failed to satisfy the \"necessity\" requirement of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2518(1)(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury convicted Yeje-Cabrera of all counts; it returned a special verdict, finding that he was responsible for more than 260 kilograms of cocaine on the conspiracy charge and exactly 260 kilograms on the attempt charge, and a forfeiture verdict. The jury convicted P&#233;rez of conspiracy to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine. It also convicted Olivero of conspiracy to distribute cocaine, though it did not attribute to him a specific drug quantity. That failure by the jury to make a specific finding led to some of the conviction and sentencing issues we discuss later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court sentenced Yeje-Cabrera to life imprisonment. It also fined him and, during sentencing, stated that it was \"allow[ing] the government's recommendation for forfeiture.\" The court sentenced P&#233;rez to 360 months' imprisonment and fined him $4 million. The court sentenced Olivero to 48 months of incarceration.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Discussion</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Challenges to Conviction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Denial of Motion to Suppress Wiretap Evidence</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yeje-Cabrera argues that the district court should have excluded evidence derived from electronic surveillance of telephone conversations because the wiretap applications failed to meet the statutory requirements. If the intercepted conversations and all evidence derived therefrom had been properly excluded, he argues, his convictions would not stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yeje-Cabrera bases his challenge on 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2518(1)(c), which states that each wiretap application \"shall include... a full and complete statement as to whether or not other investigative procedures have been tried and failed or why they reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too dangerous.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties disagree on the proper standard of review. We have long applied a unitary standard of review in &#167; 2518(1)(c) cases: \"When reviewing the government's showing of necessity, our role `is not to make a de novo determination of sufficiency as if [we] were [the issuing judge], but to decide if the facts set forth in the application were minimally adequate to support the determination that was made.'\" <i>United States v. Santana,</i> 342 F.3d 60, 65 (1st Cir.2003) (quoting <i>United States v. L&#243;pez,</i> 300 F.3d 46, 53 (1st Cir.2002) (alterations in original)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yeje-Cabrera urges us to adopt a bifurcated standard of review: first, we should review de novo whether the applicant provided to the issuing judge a \"full and complete statement\" as required by &#167; 2518(1)(c); second, if and only if the first prong is satisfied, we should review for abuse of discretion the issuing judge's determination that, under the circumstances described, electronic surveillance was necessary. One reason for this approach, Yeje-Cabrera suggests, is that &#167; 2518 imposes separate duties on separate actors: the applicant has an \"absolute\" duty under &#167; 2518(1)(c), while the issuing judge has a \"discretionary\" duty under &#167; 2518(3)(c).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Another reason for de novo review of the \"full and complete statement\" requirement, he argues, is that it would give effect to the necessity requirement: it would ensure that necessity is actually present, that the issuing judge is able to engage in an independent determination on that point, rather than one subject to the affiant's manipulation of the facts, and that meaningful appellate review is possible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though we recognize that other circuits have adopted bifurcated standards similar to that proposed by Yeje-Cabrera, <i>see, e.g., United States v. Ramirez-Encarnacion,</i> 291 F.3d 1219, 1222 n. 1 (10th Cir.2002); <i>United States v. Blackmon,</i> 273 F.3d 1204, 1207 (9th Cir.2001), this panel is bound by circuit precedent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, we see no reason to depart from the unitary standard. First, Yeje-Cabrera's approach artificially separates two concepts that are a unified whole in the statute: \"full and complete statement,\" and \"necessity.\" One might ask: of what must the applicant provide a \"full and complete statement\"? The answer is: of \"whether or not other investigative procedures have been tried and failed or why they reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too dangerous.\" &#167; 2518(1)(c). This is one requirement, not two: a full and complete statement regarding necessity, that is, circumstances in which a wiretap, though disfavored as an investigative technique, is justified. <i>See United States v. Kahn,</i> 415 U.S. 143, 153 n. 12, 94 S.Ct. 977, 39 L.Ed.2d 225 (1974) (the necessity requirement is \"designed to assure that wiretapping is not resorted to in situations where traditional investigative techniques would suffice to expose the crime\"). We see no basis for splitting in two what is properly a single inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The determination of necessity is properly committed to the issuing judge in the first instance, and we will uphold the sufficiency of the affidavit wherever \"the issuing court could have reasonably concluded that normal investigatory procedures reasonably appeared to be unlikely to succeed.\" <i>L&#243;pez,</i> 300 F.3d at 53 (quoting <i>United States v. Ashley,</i> 876 F.2d 1069, 1074 (1st Cir.1989)). It is simply \"not our province to engage in <i>de novo</i> review of an application.\" <i>United States v. Bynum,</i> 763 F.2d 474, 476 (1st Cir.1985) (quoting <i>United States v. Smith,</i> 726 F.2d 852, 864 (1st Cir.1984)); <i>see also United States v. Rivera-Rosario,</i> 300 F.3d 1, 19 n. 23 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also note that the issuing judge has the power to \"require the applicant to furnish additional testimony or documentary evidence in support of the application,\" &#167; 2518(2), if such information is necessary. Of course, officers may not deliberately omit material information that, if known to the issuing judge, would prevent a finding of necessity. Should the defendant come to believe that the government omitted material information that would have prevented a finding of necessity, he is free to seek a hearing under <i>Franks v. Delaware,</i> 438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978). <i>See, e.g., United States v. Stewart,</i> 337 F.3d 103, 105 (1st Cir.2003) (district court held <i>Franks</i> hearing with government's consent where search warrant affidavits misleadingly omitted multiple pieces of information casting doubt on credibility of informants); <i>id.</i> at 105-06 (not error to deny suppression of resulting evidence where improperly omitted information was immaterial to overall determination of probable cause); <i>id.</i> at 107 n. 2 (\"An evidentiary hearing is required only if the defendant is able to show that alleged misstatements or omissions are material to the probable cause determination.\"). A <i>Franks</i> hearing, not de novo review in this court, is the proper route for addressing that concern. <i>Cf. Rivera-Rosario,</i> 300 F.3d at 20 (\"Material omissions in a government's application are ... sufficient to constitute the basis for a <i>Franks</i> evidentiary hearing.\" (citation omitted)). Yeje-Cabrera, however, did not pursue this option.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying our unitary standard of review, we inquire whether the affidavits satisfied the statutory requirement. After reviewing the sealed affidavits, we hold that they provided a sufficient basis for the issuing judge to authorize the wiretap. Without revealing any of the information for which it was appropriate to seal the affidavits, we note that the initial affidavit supplies a detailed overview of the investigation to date, concrete reasons why a wiretap was necessary, and thorough explanations of how traditional investigative techniques were proving, or were expected to prove, unlikely to succeed or dangerous. These representations were supported.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The initial affidavit could reasonably be thought to be more than adequate. After receiving authorization to conduct the first wiretap, the officers applied for and received authorization to conduct others and to extend some beyond the initial time period. As Yeje-Cabrera points out, the subsequent affidavits do overlap considerably with the initial affidavit and with each other, sometimes containing identical wording of some points. The last affidavit, seeking authorization to wiretap a telephone line over which officers expected to hear \"vital information\" on a large cocaine delivery expected to occur the next day, incorporates by reference the statement of necessity set out in a prior (attached) affidavit, instead of setting out a fresh one. Despite Yeje-Cabrera's characterization of the affidavits as consisting largely of \"boilerplate,\" all the affidavits did contain much that was concrete and pertained to this specific investigation. <i>See L&#243;pez,</i> 300 F.3d at 53-54 (rejecting defendant's argument that application was \"mere boilerplate\" where affidavit contained specific details about the investigation and about attempts to use less invasive surveillance techniques). We have reviewed these affidavits and find no flaws in the issuing court's determination that they were sufficient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yeje-Cabrera raises several objections to the conclusion that there was no abuse of discretion by the issuing judge in determining that the affidavits were sufficient. His primary argument is that a statement which appears in all of the affidavits constitutes an admission that the affiant \"expressly ignored the `full and complete statement' requirement.\" The officer applying for the wiretap authorization stated near the beginning of each affidavit:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since this Affidavit is being submitted for the limited purpose of securing an order authorizing the interception of wire communications, I have not included details of every aspect of this investigation to date. Facts not set forth herein are not being relied on in reaching my conclusion that an order should be issued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yeje-Cabrera argues that 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2518(1)(c) requires the application to describe \"all prior investigative steps undertaken.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The argument fundamentally misreads 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2518(1)(c). The requirement of a full and complete statement cannot possibly mean that every single detail, even if relevant to the wiretap, must be included. The plain language of &#167; 2518(1)(c) only requires a full and complete statement \"as to\" the crucial issue: \"whether or not other investigative procedures have been tried and failed or why they reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2518(1)(c). Many aspects of an investigation, especially in a large, complex case like this one, will not be relevant to the question of whether a particular wiretap is necessary. And even if there is some relevance, the officer need not detail every single fact, so long as sufficient facts are described as to the crucial issue and material contrary facts are not omitted. If there are relevant and material omissions, the issuing judge may deny the application or seek additional information, or the defendant may seek a <i>Franks</i> hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Yeje-Cabrera argues that the government did not do enough to exhaust traditional investigative methods before resorting to the wiretap. We have previously made clear, though, that \"the government need not demonstrate that it exhausted all investigative procedures.\" <i>Santana,</i> 342 F.3d at 65 (citing <i>L&#243;pez,</i> 300 F.3d at 52). The wiretap application simply \"must `demonstrate that the government has made a reasonable, good faith effort to run the gamut of normal investigative procedures before resorting to means so intrusive as electronic interception of telephone calls.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>United States v. London,</i> 66 F.3d 1227, 1237 (1st Cir.1995)); <i>see also Ashley,</i> 876 F.2d at 1072 (\"[T]he government is not required to show that other methods have been wholly unsuccessful. Nor is the government forced to run outlandish risks or to exhaust every conceivable alternative before requesting authorization for electronic surveillance.\" (citations omitted)). We conclude that the district court did not err in refusing to suppress the evidence obtained from the wiretaps.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Claim of Error in District Court Inquiry of Jurors</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yeje-Cabrera raises a claim of jury taint arising from a note that a juror sent to the judge. We review for abuse of discretion the claim that the trial court failed to conduct an appropriate inquiry into allegations of jury taint. <i>United States v. Paniagua-Ramos,</i> 251 F.3d 242, 249 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the commencement of the trial, the district court instructed the jurors that they must not discuss the case with each other or with anyone else during the trial, that it was the government's burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the defendants were not obliged to testify or present any evidence. For the first ten days of trial, there was no inkling of anything awry with any juror. Then, during the eleventh day of trial, a juror sent a note to the judge. The note said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">WHY [ARE] THE DEFENDANTS NOT GOING TO BE CROSS-EXAMINED?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>4 DEFENDANTS SHOULD BE CROSS-EXAMINED!</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>THIS SHOULD BE DONE IN THIS CASE!</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court shared this note with counsel. Defense counsel urged the court to identify the juror, interview her and the other jurors individually to ascertain whether she had spoken with them, then excuse her. The court declined, opting instead to issue a strongly worded curative instruction on the burden of proof and on jurors' duty to refrain from discussion. The court instructed the members of the jury that if any of them could not follow these instructions, he or she was to speak with the clerk. It polled the jury as a group, asking for a show of hands on whether jurors had discussed the case among themselves. No juror admitted doing so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That night and the next morning, the juror who had sent the note to the judge communicated with the court and its clerk multiple times. She expressed that she was upset over the judge's handling of the note and that she still had opinions about the case that were consistent with her note. By the time trial was to resume on the twelfth day, the court had dismissed this juror and so informed counsel. Defense counsel again requested that the court interview the remaining jurors individually, but the court declined, stating that the jurors had already satisfactorily responded to the prior day's group inquiry, and that since that time they could have had no contact with the note-sending juror.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yeje-Cabrera's essential claim is that the juror who sent the note, although removed from the jury the next day, likely had expressed her strongly felt views to the other jurors and thus tainted the jury's deliberations. The court's response to the note, Yeje-Cabrera argues, was inadequate. In particular, he points to \"peer pressure,\" and to the fact that the court had just delivered a \"stinging rebuke\" to the jury, as factors rendering the show of hands unreliable. Even though the jurors unanimously indicated that they had followed the court's instructions not to discuss the case among themselves, he argues, the court did not do enough: under these circumstances, a juror who had not followed instructions could not be expected to raise a hand. He argues that the court should have individually interviewed the juror who sent the note and all the other members of the jury to ascertain whether they had followed instructions. Yeje-Cabrera further argues that the district court's method of handling the problem was so deficient as to require that the conviction be vacated: he claims that the district court could not \"do effective damage control,\" and that this court cannot engage in meaningful appellate review, because the district court's failure to conduct individualized inquiries deprived it and us of essential information. Such hyperbole does not win the day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This was a difficult situation and the trial judge acted well within the range of permissible options. Trial judges have a wide latitude in how to handle a claim of potential juror misconduct. <i>See Paniagua-Ramos,</i> 251 F.3d at 250 (\"[W]hile a trial court has an unflagging duty adequately to probe a nonfrivolous claim of jury taint, the court has wide discretion to determine the scope of the resulting inquiry and the mode and manner in which it will be conducted.\" (citations omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here the claim of taint is not about the juror who sent the note; she was dismissed after she said she could not continue in the case. The question is whether she tainted the others. Yeje-Cabrera draws the inference &#8212; from the emphatic nature of the juror's note to the judge &#8212; that the juror had disseminated her views to the other jurors, in violation of instructions. Moreover, he argues, her expressed views might have overridden in the other jurors' minds the court's strong curative instruction about the government's burden of proof.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the posited scenario is possible, we think that such inferences are not reasonable. During the show of hands, the juror who sent the note and the other jurors denied there had been discussions. We acknowledge that asking jurors en masse, before their peers, whether they have failed to comply with the court's instructions may tend to discourage an honest affirmative response. But the court also invited individual jurors to contact it afterwards, and none, other than the juror who sent the note, did so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the one juror had communicated her views to the other jurors, there is also no reason to think those jurors were dissuaded from following the instructions of the judge, much less that this somehow led jurors to penalize the defendants for their decision not to take the stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was no abuse of discretion. <i>Cf.

Woods,</i> 210 F.3d 70, 74 (1st Cir.2000).

The jury was not asked to determine the quantity of drugs involved in the conspiracy as a whole. The court did, however, instruct the jury that the government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that each defendant joined \"this conspiracy\" &#8212; the one charged in the indictment, a \"wholesale\" rather than \"retail\" conspiracy to distribute cocaine. The indictment had alleged conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute \"more than 5 kilograms of cocaine.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From this, Olivero's counsel argues that unless the jury has found a specific quantity of drugs, a defendant cannot be guilty of conspiracy. He bases this argument on <i>United States v. Gonzalez,</i> 420 F.3d 111 (2d Cir.2005). He attributes to the case a holding that drug quantity must always be pled and proved beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury before there can be a conspiracy conviction. In the absence of a jury question asking the jurors to find the quantity of drugs involved in the conspiracy itself, he argues, that standard has not been met.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Olivero confuses issues of criminal liability with issues of sentence. He overreads <i>Gonzalez,</i> which simply holds that a defendant charged with an aggravated drug conspiracy under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A), who does not admit but rather disputes the requisite drug quantity, could not be held to a guilty plea to that offense. <i>Id.</i> at 115. Rather, such a defendant's plea \"at best supports a conviction on a lesser, unquantified drug charge, whose sentencing range is prescribed by &#167; 841(b)(1)(C).\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Treating 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(C) as establishing a default statutory maximum sentence, the maximum is still 20 years.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> This is so no matter how small the amount of the cocaine which was the subject of the conspiracy. This court has previously affirmed the conviction but remanded for resentencing no higher than the default statutory maximum of 20 years on similar facts. <i>See United States v. P&#233;rez-Ruiz,</i> 353 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.2003), <i>cert denied,</i> 541 U.S. 1005, 124 S.Ct. 2058, 158 L.Ed.2d 522 (2004) (\"<i>P&#233;rez-Ruiz I</i>\") (defendant was charged with conspiracy to distribute specific drug quantities, but jury was not instructed that it had to find specific amounts in order to convict and there were no special verdict findings). \"No specific drug quantity needs to be proven for a jury to convict a defendant of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute. It is therefore not erroneous <i>per se</i> to allow a jury to find that a defendant is guilty of the crime charged but responsible for a lesser quantity of drugs than specified in the indictment.\" <i>United States v. G&#243;mez-Rosario,</i> 418 F.3d 90, 104 (1st Cir.2005) (citations omitted); <i>see also id.</i> at 103-05 (special verdict form had one blank for filling in guilty/not guilty and other blanks for filling in defendant's responsibility for particular drug quantity, and jury was instructed to convict only upon finding that the \"agreement specified in the indictment, and not some other agreement ... existed\"). There is no basis here for reversing Olivero's conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Forfeiture Order: Violation of Rule 32.2(b)(3)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yeje-Cabrera asks on appeal that the final order forfeiting $5.2 million and two parcels of land be reversed because it was entered after judgment was entered instead of being incorporated into the judgment as required by Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.2(b)(3). The Rule provides: \"At sentencing &#8212; or at any time before sentencing if the defendant consents &#8212; the order of forfeiture becomes final as to the defendant and <i>must</i> be made a part of the sentence and <i>be included in the judgment.</i>\" Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.2(b)(3) (emphases added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject the government's position that Rule 32.2(b)(3) was not violated because the court told the defendant at sentencing that it was \"allow[ing]\" the preliminary order of forfeiture to become final. <i>Cf. United States v. Melendez-Santana,</i> 353 F.3d 93, 100 (1st Cir.2003) (stating that \"where the conditions of supervised release announced at the sentencing hearing conflict in a material way with the conditions of supervised release in the written sentencing order, the oral conditions control\"), <i>overruled in part on other grounds by United States v. Padilla,</i> 415 F.3d 211, 215 (1st Cir.2005) (en banc). The oral sentencing does not trump Rule 32.2(b)(3). <i>See United States v. Pease,</i> 331 F.3d 809, 814-15 (11th Cir.2003) (forfeiture, to be valid, must be included in the judgment); <i>cf. United States v. Petrie,</i> 302 F.3d 1280, 1284-85 (11th Cir.2002) (where forfeiture was not mentioned at sentencing and only vaguely mentioned in judgment, district court lacked jurisdiction to enter preliminary forfeiture order six months after sentencing); <i>but see United States v. Loe,</i> 248 F.3d 449, 464 (5th Cir.2001) (where forfeiture was mentioned at oral sentencing but not in written judgment, \"the oral ruling prevails\" over conflicting written order, so that \"[t]he court's oral pronouncement on forfeiture, which it issued at the sentencing hearing, consequently remains effective in the face of a contrary written judgment\"). There was a clear violation of the \"must be included in the judgment\" portion of the Rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appropriate remedy for violation of the Rule depends on context. One very serious situation would be if the violation bespoke a lack of notice and opportunity for the defendant and third parties to object to a proposed forfeiture. <i>Cf. Pease,</i> 331 F.3d at 816 n. 18 (oral sentencing did not include forfeiture); <i>Petrie,</i> 302 F.3d at 1284 (forfeiture was not mentioned at sentencing hearing, written judgment merely stated that defendant was \"subject to forfeiture as cited\" in one count of the indictment, and preliminary forfeiture order was not entered until six months after sentencing).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That is not the situation here. The forfeiture claim was contained in the indictment, and the jury returned a special verdict finding that Yeje-Cabrera had derived the property \"directly or indirectly, as a result of the conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute.\" The presentence report mentions the forfeiture allegation in the indictment and states that the jury \"returned a verdict of guilty on all counts.\" The \"Sentencing Options\" section of the presentence report does not, however, mention forfeiture. Two months after the verdict, the government moved for a preliminary order of forfeiture; the motion was granted on February 24, 2003. Two days later, at sentencing, the district court stated that it was \"allow[ing] the government's recommendation for forfeiture.\" When the court said this, it must have been referring to a recommendation of a final order of forfeiture, since the preliminary order had already issued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For reasons which are unclear, no order of forfeiture was set forth in the judgment entered on March 3, or in the amended judgment entered on May 9, 2003. On August 14, 2003, the government moved for a final order of forfeiture. The government apparently did not realize that the \"must be included in the judgment\" requirement of Rule 32.2 had not been met, as it did not move to correct the judgment under Rule 36. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 36 (\"After giving any notice it considers appropriate, the court may at any time correct a clerical error in a judgment, order, or other part of the record, or correct an error in the record arising from oversight or omission.\"). On September 19, 2003, the court entered a final order of forfeiture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Importantly, it appears that Yeje-Cabrera never once opposed the merits of the proposed forfeiture. The government so represents, and Yeje-Cabrera does not represent to the contrary. Essentially, Yeje-Cabrera argues now that because there was a violation of Rule 32.2, he is entitled to reversal of the forfeiture order, which he had never opposed on the merits. We disagree.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There may be occasions when violations of Rules warrant a remedy of reversal. But the portion of Rule 32.2 which was violated here is largely a housekeeping rule and does not itself go to any fundamental rights of defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of the primary purposes of Rule 32.2, as its history shows, is to allow for the entry of a preliminary order of forfeiture. Before the 1996 Amendments, the predecessor Rule 32(d)(2) did not explicitly provide for such a preliminary forfeiture procedure. In 1996, Rule 32(d)(2) was amended to provide for the entry of a preliminary order of forfeiture after the forfeiture verdict and after \"providing notice to the defendant and a reasonable opportunity to be heard.\" The amendment added that \"[a]t sentencing, a final order of forfeiture shall be made part of the sentence and included in the judgment.\" This marks the first appearance of language similar to that relied upon by Yeje-Cabrera.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Advisory Committee Notes to the 1996 Amendments illustrate that the drafters were primarily concerned with enabling the government to obtain a preliminary order of forfeiture. The Notes cite three problems the new procedure avoids: delay in the government's locating and preserving forfeited assets, delay in third parties' ability to assert interests in the property, and the need to resort to restraining orders to maintain the status quo. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 32 advisory committee's notes (1996 amendments). The drafters do evince concern with protecting the defendant's interests, but do so by highlighting the defendant's right to notice and an opportunity to be heard, rather than by emphasizing the written judgment requirement. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 32.2 serves other efficiency interests as well, in particular, preserving the resources of the judicial system and of potentially interested third parties. The Advisory Committee Notes on Subdivision (b) of Rule 32.2 are concerned almost entirely with improving the procedure by which the relative ownership interests of the defendant and of third parties are determined. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.2 advisory committee's notes (2000 amendments). Tellingly, the Advisory Committee Notes do not focus on the written judgment requirement at all. Instead, they focus on explaining how the Rule avoids wasteful litigation. The Notes discuss how the coexistence of former Rule 31(e) with 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853(n) and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1963(<i>l</i>) caused duplicative proceedings to determine relative ownership interests in property subject to forfeiture, and they explain how the new procedure avoids that problem.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, Rule 32.2 also does serve interests of the defendant. In particular, the Rule ensures that all the penalties imposed on the defendant occur as part of a \"package,\" so that forfeiture is not imposed above and beyond a sentence that the court had already determined to be adequate. The Eleventh Circuit's observation in <i>Pease</i> puts the point well:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[F]orfeiture is part of the defendant's sentencing package for an obvious reason. The magnitude of the forfeiture may influence how the court treats the other parts of the package. For example, if forfeiture is sizeable, the court may impose a fine at the bottom of the Sentencing Guidelines' range or, if the forfeiture would render the defendant impecunious, perhaps no fine at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Pease,</i> 331 F.3d at 816 (discussing Rule 32, the predecessor to Rule 32.2, which in this respect was similar to the current Rule). On the facts of this case, mere failure to comply with Rule 32.2(b)(3)'s written judgment requirement does not harm this interest of the defendant. The district court included the forfeiture at the time it orally sentenced; the purpose of avoiding unduly large sentence/forfeiture \"packages\" was served here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court addressed the mirror image of our problem in <i>United States v. Ferrario-Pozzi,</i> 368 F.3d 5 (1st Cir.2004), where the final order of judgment did include the written order of forfeiture, but defendant argued it had not been included in the oral pronouncement of the sentence. In fact, the defendant had agreed at sentencing \"that he was not contesting forfeiture itself, but simply the amount over two million dollars,\" and he requested that this issue be resolved at a later hearing. <i>Id.</i> at 7. <i>Ferrario-Pozzi</i> pointed out that cases where the defendant did not receive adequate notice that a final order of forfeiture would be entered pose different concerns than cases where the defendant knew of this fact all along. <i>See id.</i> at 9. The efficiency of the court system's operations may have been hurt in this case, but Yeje-Cabrera was not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Fifth Circuit held in <i>Loe,</i> 248 F.3d at 464, we find nothing objectionable about employing a later <i>nunc pro tunc</i> amendment to cure a mere failure of the judgment to describe a final order of forfeiture as required by Rule 32.2(b)(3). This is provided, of course, that the judge has properly addressed the forfeiture issue previously. <i>See id.</i> (trial judge had included forfeiture at oral pronouncement of sentencing and had issued a preliminary written order of forfeiture); <i>United States v. Hatcher,</i> 323 F.3d 666, 673-74 (8th Cir.2003) (deeming omission of the forfeiture from both the sentencing and the judgment to be mere clerical error, where the district court had earlier entered a preliminary forfeiture order). Accordingly we order amendment of the judgment <i>nunc pro tunc</i> to include the final order of forfeiture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Sentencing Issues</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Defendants' Claims</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. <i>Apprendi/Booker &#8212; All Defendants</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All three defendants challenge their sentences on the basis of a misunderstanding of <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Each argues that it was error for the district court to impose a sentence on the basis of facts found by the court by a preponderance of the evidence, but not found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. In Yeje-Cabrera's case, the alleged flaw was a sentence enhancement under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (U.S.S.G.) &#167; 3B1.1 based on the court's finding that he was \"the organizer, manager and leader of a large-scale drug organization including more than five individuals.\" In P&#233;rez's case, the jury stated in its special verdict form that P&#233;rez was responsible for five kilograms of cocaine, but the district court found that P&#233;rez was responsible for a drug quantity between 15 and 50 kilograms. It also imposed a sentence enhancement under U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1, based on its finding that P&#233;rez was a career offender.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> In Olivero's case, the claimed error arises from the district court's finding that Olivero was responsible for \"at least 499 grams\" of cocaine, when the jury verdict had attributed no particular drug quantity to Olivero.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These objections &#8212; that the judge, not the jury, found certain facts &#8212; misapprehend the law as it was eventually articulated in <i>United States v. Booker,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). As we explained in <i>United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d 68 (1st Cir.2005), the <i>Booker</i> error \"is not that a judge (by a preponderance of the evidence) determined facts under the Guidelines which increased a sentence beyond that authorized by the jury verdict or an admission by the defendant; the error is only that the judge did so in a mandatory Guidelines system.\" <i>Id.</i> at 75.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For this reason, we reject Olivero's argument that because the jury did not attribute a specific drug quantity to him, his sentence must be vacated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Olivero argues in particular that, because there was no specific drug quantity found by the jury, the \"statutory maximum\" for him was that based on a Guidelines offense level of 12, pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(c)(14) (providing for a base offense level of 12 where the drug quantity is less than 25 grams of cocaine). With a base offense level of 12 and a criminal history category of I, the high end of the Guidelines range would have been 16 months. <i>See United States v. Green,</i> 346 F.Supp.2d 259, 327 (D.Mass.2004). But the actual statutory maximum here was 20 years. The district court's attribution to Olivero of a specific quantity of cocaine (\"at least 499 grams\") no more invalidates his sentence than it does his conviction. There was a period between <i>Blakely</i> and <i>Booker</i> when the district courts were forced to predict and improvise. Some courts, as the court did here, predicted wrongly that Sixth Amendment concerns required as a remedy that certain issues (for instance, drug quantity) be decided by a jury, not a judge. It is now well settled that this was wrong; the remedy was to make the Guidelines non-mandatory. <i>See Booker,</i> 125 S.Ct. at 756-57; <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 75.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since <i>Booker</i> we have made it clear that the district courts may make drug quantity determinations for sentencing purposes:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the 5-4 constitutional ruling in <i>Booker,</i> judge-made enhancements under the guidelines that result in a sentence greater than the sentence that could be imposed based solely on the facts found by the jury do amount to Sixth Amendment violations if the guidelines are treated as mandatory; but under the companion 5-4 remedial ruling in <i>Booker,</i> this problem is washed out by treating the guidelines as advisory.

First, the government argues that the district court erred in holding that <i>Apprendi</i> precluded it from finding a drug quantity above 499 grams (particularly in the face of evidence that Olivero was responsible for a considerably greater quantity of cocaine). Second, the government argues, the court erred in declining to follow the Guidelines in order to punish the prosecution for what the court considered to be impermissible fact bargaining. Specifically, the government takes issue with the court's decision to a) deny a firearms enhancement under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1), even though it found that the facts warranting the enhancement had been shown by a preponderance of the evidence, and b) grant a reduction in Olivero's offense level under &#167; 3B1.2(a) for being a minimal participant, when it was clear that Olivero was not a minimal participant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Olivero, a prime actor in the conspiracy, received only a 48-month sentence in the face of a statutory maximum of 20 years.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> The overall conspiracy involved possession with intent to distribute 260 kilograms of cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. <i>How the Court Arrived at Olivero's Sentence</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Olivero and 20 other defendants in this case were indicted on December 20, 2001. Before trial, there was a flurry of plea bargaining activity: in all, 15 of the 21 defendants pled guilty, seven \"on the very eve of trial.\" <i>Green,</i> 346 F.Supp.2d at 325.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 10, 2002, the probation office was asked to prepare a \"pre-plea\" presentence report for Olivero. Evidently this judge of the district court orders such \"pre-plea\" presentence reports as a matter of course. <i>See id.</i> at 279 (\"This court has burdened an already strained probation office by ordering pre-plea presentence reports in virtually every case as the best defense to illegal fact bargaining.\"). The \"pre-plea\" presentence report was prepared on October 29, 2002. It discussed the possibility of a minimal-role reduction for Olivero, but rejected it as not warranted on the evidence. It did not mention that Olivero had possessed a firearm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 14, 2002, the U.S. Attorney sent to Olivero's attorney the plea agreement that they had negotiated, and Olivero and his attorney signed the document on October 30, 2002. In the proposed agreement, there was no mention of a weapon or a weapons enhancement, and the government agreed not to oppose a minimal participant downward adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.2(a). At the time, the government was also negotiating agreements with a number of co-defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The proposed deal fell through on November 1, 2002, just before trial was to begin on November 4. Olivero withdrew from the deal when, at the hearing on acceptance of the plea, the court informed him that a plea would likely result in his immediate remand to custody. <i>Green,</i> 346 F.Supp.2d at 325. Olivero went to trial. Switching from its position during the plea agreement, the government presented evidence at trial tending to show that Olivero's role in the offense was more than minimal and connecting Olivero to a handgun whose ownership was in dispute. The jury returned its verdict, finding Olivero guilty, on December 12, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The post-conviction presentence report, dated April 10, 2003, states that a handgun was found in Olivero's bedroom, along with ammunition, 14.4 grams of cocaine, a scale, and a money-counting machine. Under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1), this meant a two-level enhancement applied.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> The Probation Office took the position that an adjustment for minimal role in the offense was not warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court first found Olivero responsible for \"at least 499 grams\" of cocaine, which led to a base offense level of 24. The court explained that because the jury left Olivero's drug quantity space blank on its verdict form, the jury must have found that the prosecution failed to prove as to him a quantity of 500 grams or more beyond a reasonable doubt. The court further stated that under <i>Apprendi,</i> a judge could not find a higher drug quantity on his own, by a mere preponderance of evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the court found that Olivero in fact possessed a gun in furtherance of the crime, but it declined to impose a sentence enhancement, citing what it viewed as the government's improper fact-bargaining, that is, an improper inconsistency between the government's willingness to ignore the gun enhancement as part of a plea agreement and its request for the gun enhancement after trial. The district court emphasized that the \"pre-plea\" presentence report did not mention a firearm. The court stated that the prosecution knew that a weapon had been found in Olivero's room \"before the preplea was entered into,\" and rejected the prosecution's argument that the facts necessary to prove gun possession became clearer as the prosecution prepared for and ultimately conducted the trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> As a result, the court punished the prosecution by refusing to enhance the sentence, even though the April 10, 2003 post-conviction presentence report had recommended the two-level U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1) firearm enhancement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the court addressed Olivero's role in the offense. If a defendant is a \"minimal\" participant in criminal activity, his offense level is to be decreased by four levels. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.2(a). If he is a \"minor\" participant, the reduction is two levels, and if his role is somewhere in between, the reduction is three levels. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 3B1.2. The court awarded Olivero a 4-point minimal-role reduction. It found that the government had offered to recommend this reduction as part of the proposed plea agreement and, in the court's view, had engaged in improper fact-bargaining by taking different positions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> In essence, the court stated, the prosecution's change of position had burdened Olivero's right to insist on a jury trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on these calculations, Olivero's Guidelines sentencing range was 33 to 41 months. The court departed upwards by seven months because Olivero was \"in with these people\" and not \"some bit player\" and because the conspiracy was extraordinarily extensive and dangerous &#8212; facts it considered not sufficiently reflected in the Guidelines range.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant had not advanced the arguments used by the district court to deny the gun enhancement or to grant the minimal participant downward departure. From what we can tell of the record, Olivero did <i>not</i> allege that the prosecution was retaliating against him for insisting on trial, much less offer any evidence in support of such a claim. Instead, the court raised the fact-bargaining issue <i>sua sponte.</i> It also placed the initial burden on the prosecution to explain itself.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 18, 2004, after the defendants had appealed their convictions and jurisdiction over their cases was in this court, the district court, <i>sua sponte,</i> published an 80-page advisory opinion (which it styled as a sentencing memorandum) in which it expanded upon its reasons for sanctioning the government. <i>See Green,</i> 346 F.Supp.2d 259.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. <i>Analysis of District Court's Rationale</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">i. <i>Apprendi</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court post-<i>Booker</i> may determine drug quantity for purposes of sentence enhancements under the Guidelines. The district court's <i>Apprendi</i> rationale for limiting its consideration of drug quantity was simply a wrong guess as to the direction the law would take. The district court was not \"constrained\" by the jury's verdict, as it thought it was, to finding less than 500 grams of cocaine. Instead, it could (and should) have found Olivero responsible for the amount of cocaine established by a preponderance of the evidence against him &#8212; though of course, the ultimate sentence may not exceed the statutory maximum of 20 years. That alone is reason to vacate the sentence and to remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We go on to address the government's claims of Guidelines and statutory error. <i>See Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 76.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ii. <i>Fact Bargaining</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court offered three rationales for its reduction of Olivero's sentence as a punishment of the prosecution for \"unconstitutional\" or \"illegal\" fact bargaining. The first rationale was that the defendant's right to trial by jury was impermissibly burdened by the government's change in position on the firearm enhancement and minimal role adjustment between plea bargaining and trial. The second was that the punishment was justified because the government somehow deceived the court. The third was that the Guidelines prohibited the government from doing what it did and the appropriate sanction was to give the defendant a lower sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court was attempting to address some aspects of the pre-<i>Booker</i> mandatory guidelines system which it considered particularly unfair and to address the power given to the prosecution by the Guidelines. The court is also passionate about protecting the right to trial by jury. That the court felt strongly is evidenced by the fact that it acted <i>sua sponte:</i> Olivero did not seek a reduction in his sentence on any of these grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Booker's</i> rendering of the Guidelines advisory (subject to restraints for reasonableness) may alleviate some of the concerns which motivated the court. In this case, however, none of the district court's rationales justify the sentence it imposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) <i>Fact Bargaining and the Right to a Jury Trial</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The term \"fact bargaining\" has been used loosely to cover a variety of situations, from affirmative misrepresentations to a court to more benign agreements by counsel to base sentencing on other factors. Fact bargaining may arise when there are different views of the facts, counsels' ability to prove them, and their consequences. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Sarner, \"<i>Fact Bargaining\" Under the Sentencing Guidelines: The Role of the Probation Department,</i> 8 Fed. Sent. R. 328, 1996 WL 671569, at *2 (\"Counsel for both sides must assess their prospects for success before a jury, based on a wide variety of conflicting factors that develop during the government's investigation and as available defenses. That the truth appears somewhere in between, after the dust has settled, is a world view shared by most criminal practitioners....

Under some circumstances, the prosecution may refuse to disclose certain kinds of exculpatory material to the defendant in the course of plea bargaining. <i>See United States v.

It is clear that \"[t]he fact that those who plead generally receive more lenient treatment, or at least a government recommendation of more lenient treatment than co-defendants who go to trial, does not in and of itself constitute an unconstitutional burden on one's right to go to trial and prove [one's] case.\" <i>United States v.

But the <i>Pearce</i> line of decisions deals with circumstances different from Olivero's case and arises in the context of 1) resentencing in a second trial after the defendant has obtained a new trial by appeal or collateral attack or 2) resentencing after the defendant has successfully withdrawn a guilty plea. <i>See Pearce,</i> 395 U.S. at 725, 89 S.Ct. 2072 (\"Due process of law, then, requires that vindictiveness against a defendant for having successfully attacked his first conviction must play no part in the sentence he receives after a new trial.\"); <i>Smith,</i> 490 U.S. at 795, 109 S.Ct. 2201.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has said that how the government acts during plea bargaining raises no vindictiveness concerns, but only concerns of whether the plea was voluntary.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> Indeed, in <i>Bordenkircher,</i> the Court held that the due process concerns expressed in the <i>Pearce</i> line of cases about punishment or retaliation are simply not present in a plea bargaining situation. \"[I]n the `give-and-take' of plea bargaining, there is no such element of punishment or retaliation so long as the accused is free to accept or reject the prosecution's offer.\" 434 U.S. at 363, 98 S.Ct. 663. Here, the defendant withdrew from the plea agreement, so the knowing and voluntary test under <i>Boykin v.

Perry,</i> 417 U.S. 21, 27-28, 94 S.Ct. 2098, 40 L.Ed.2d 628 (1974); <i>cf. Johnson v. Vose,</i> 927 F.2d 10 (1st Cir.1991). The district court focused on burden on a defendant's trial rights and did not find vindictiveness.

O'Neil,</i> 11 F.3d 292, 301 n. 11 (1st Cir.1993) (\"[W]e today join six other circuits in recognizing Chapter 7 policy statements as advisory rather than mandatory.\"). Treating the policy statement as advisory recognizes the difficulty of enforcement of any such rule. In any event, the policy statement provides no justification for a court to sentence a defendant on any basis other than the facts before it, much less does it provide a justification for a court to disregard the facts before it as a \"remedy\" for the government's earlier failure to provide all the facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p140\">\n      <span class=\"num\">140</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The proposition, implicit in the court's view, that sentencing would be better if there were utter candor and complete disclosure as to all points by the prosecution is itself problematic. Counsel should not affirmatively misstate the material facts at sentencing. <i>See United States v. Casas,</i> 425 F.3d 23, 39-41 (1st Cir.2005). Still, there is a line, admittedly ambiguous, between an affirmative misrepresentation of facts presented at sentencing and how prosecutors (and defendants) handle unclear or less provable facts. <i>See</i> Gardner &amp; Rifkind, <i>A Basic Guide to Plea Bargaining Under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines,</i> 7 Crim. Just. 14, 16 (Summer 1992) (\"The stipulation cannot contain misleading facts.... Where facts are unclear or unascertainable, the parties may agree on some form of them without further justification or explanation to the court.\" (citation omitted) (citing U.S.S.G. &#167; 6B1.4(a)(2))).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p141\">\n      <span class=\"num\">141</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the prosecutor knew and could prove a gun enhancement at the time of the plea bargain, that fact would not make a difference to our analysis. No misrepresentation was made; rather, there was an omission, helpful to the defendant, which was an implicit part of the bargain. Rule 11(c)(1)(B) expressly contemplates that the attorney for the government can agree with the defendant's request that a sentencing factor does or does not apply, though this is not binding on the court. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1)(B). It was under that rule that Olivero's plea was tendered. If the defendant and the government have agreed on a sentence free of a possible enhancement, there is a significant question as to why they should be burdened with an obligation to disclose the evidence supporting the enhancement at a plea hearing. The obligation imposed by the Rule is to \"disclose the plea agreement.\" Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p142\">\n      <span class=\"num\">142</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A system of mandatory disclosure of all possible information at a plea hearing would not usually help defendants. Moreover, the costs of monitoring compliance with such a mandatory disclosure system are high, and many of the efficiencies created by plea bargaining would be lost. It would also lead to the blurring of roles. After all, the federal rules prohibit involvement by a trial judge in plea bargaining. This is true whether through the front door or the back. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1) (\"An attorney for the government and the defendant's attorney ... may discuss and reach a plea agreement. The court must not participate in these discussions.\"); <i>cf.</i> 1A C. Wright, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> &#167; 175.1 (3d ed. 1999) (\"That the defendant has accepted a bargain proposed by the prosecutor creates no constitutional right to have the bargain specifically enforced. `A plea bargain standing alone is without constitutional significance ....'\" (quoting <i>Mabry v. Johnson,</i> 467 U.S. 504, 507-08, 104 S.Ct. 2543, 81 L.Ed.2d 437 (1984))). In short, what happened here involved the artifacts of a system which is well accepted. While Congress and the Supreme Court could have chosen to structure matters differently, they have not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p143\">\n      <span class=\"num\">143</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court was correct to condemn any deception of the court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a> But here, no claim of deception of the court is possible. The court, at the time of sentencing, did have all the facts before it on which to impose a sentence, and Olivero had fair notice of the issues. The prosecution had put on evidence at trial showing Olivero's ownership of the gun; Olivero in turn had pointed the finger at another defendant. The evidence was reviewed in the post-conviction presentence report, with Olivero objecting to the suggestion that he owned the gun and the probation office defending its stance. At sentencing, ownership of the gun was discussed yet again. The same abundance of evidence and debate characterized the issue of Olivero's role in the offense, culminating in the court's conclusion that Olivero was assuredly not \"some bit player\" or \"casual hanger-on,\" but rather was \"in with these people.\" There can be no suggestion that at the time of sentencing, the government was deceiving the court by hiding evidence of any sort, whether inculpatory or exculpatory.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a> The prosecution does not argue that it has a right to lie to a court and it did not do so here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p144\">\n      <span class=\"num\">144</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(c) <i>Fact Bargaining and Other Provisions of the Guidelines</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p145\">\n      <span class=\"num\">145</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also referred to other provisions of the Guidelines themselves as imposing an obligation on the government to disclose all information at the stage a court is considering a plea and not to change its position thereafter. This misreads the Guidelines. One argument from the Sentencing Guidelines is that &#167; 1B1.3 (\"Relevant Conduct\") specifies that the base offense level and adjustments be based on \"all acts and omissions committed, aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused by the defendant\" and \"all harm that resulted from\" those acts. U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3(a)(1)(A), (3). There is no claim that the government did not provide such information at sentencing. Ironically, the district court sanctioned the government because it <i>did</i> advance exactly such evidence of relevant conduct at sentencing. By its terms, U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3 concerns what the court should do with the information before it at sentencing and does not create a set of sanctions against the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p146\">\n      <span class=\"num\">146</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other Guidelines concern arises from Application Note 1 to U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.8 (\"Use of Certain Information\"), which simply makes it clear that that particular Guideline does not authorize the government to withhold information from the court. In any case, there is no evidence here that Olivero provided self-incriminating information that the prosecution withheld from the court, so &#167; 1B1.8 is inapplicable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p147\">\n      <span class=\"num\">147</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(d) <i>Summary</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p148\">\n      <span class=\"num\">148</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecution's conduct here transgressed no norm, constitutional or legal. There was no cause to punish the prosecution at all. We defer until some other case the question of whether a district court may ever reduce a defendant's sentence as a sanction against the government for its conduct in earlier negotiating a plea which is not accepted. But we do note that the sentencing objectives set by the statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a)(2), refer to punishment of the offender, deterrence of <i>crime,</i> protection of the public, and rehabilitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p149\">\n      <span class=\"num\">149</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentencing of Olivero is vacated and the matter is remanded to the district court. Olivero thus will be resentenced in a post-<i>Booker</i> regime in which the Guidelines are no longer mandatory. We have reversed each of the rationales relied on by the district court, in the government's sentencing appeal, as a matter of law. This means that any reliance upon them at resentencing would be inherently unreasonable. <i>See Booker,</i> 125 S.Ct. at 765-66.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.

Upon being told by the government that it lacked jurisdiction, the court vacated its attempt to vacate Olivero's sentence. The court did proceed, however, to issue what was in essence a sentencing memorandum pertaining not only to Olivero's case but also to several other unrelated criminal cases, explaining in more detail its reasons for the sentence it had imposed on Olivero and its belief that the maximum constitutionally permissible sentence for Olivero was 16 months. <i>United States v.

The prosecution renewed its objection after the court instructed the jury. The defense attorneys did not object on the drug-quantity point, and Yeje-Cabrera's attorney said he preferred the court's proposition. Olivero's attorney made some requests about jury instructions, but none pertaining to the drug-quantity issue.

If so, the record refutes the argument easily. The court found that P&#233;rez was a \"career offender, having had two prior convictions of either a crime of violence or [a] controlled substance violation.\"<i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1(a). Under U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1(b), the offense level provided by the career offender subsection or the otherwise applicable offense level, whichever is greater, must be applied. The table in that subsection provides that if the statutory maximum for the offense is life imprisonment, then the offense level is 37. Here, the statutory maximum was life, as provided by 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846 (conspiracy to commit an offense is punished the same as the offense itself) and &#167; 841(b)(1)(A)(ii) (distribution of five kilograms or more of cocaine subjects the offender to a maximum penalty of life in prison). Therefore, the offense level was 37 under the career offender table, and this was greater than the otherwise applicable offense level of 34, so it was the correct level to apply under the career offender Guideline. Under U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1(b), \"[a] career offender's criminal history category in every case under this subsection shall be Category VI.\" With a total offense level of 37 and a criminal history of Category VI, the Guidelines range was thirty years to life in prison.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Olivero also challenges his sentence by claiming that the district court abused its discretion when it imposed an upward departure of seven months.

Olivero argues that it was error to depart on the basis of his role in the offense, because it was already adequately addressed under the Guidelines. It is clear, though, that the district court not only could have, but would have, departed on the sole basis of the other ground it cited: the extraordinary extent and danger of the conspiracy.

As for the gun, Olivero only objected on the basis that the weapon did not belong to him and that the evidence did not support the firearm enhancement, without mentioning the government's earlier position &#8212; much less attributing any improper motive to the government. At sentencing, Olivero's attorney simply followed the court's lead, expressing agreement with the court's view that the government knew all along about the gun.

At this stage of the proceedings, the prosecutor's assessment of the proper extent of prosecution may not have crystallized. In contrast, once a trial begins &#8212; and certainly by the time a conviction has been obtained &#8212; it is much more likely that the State has discovered and assessed all of the information against an accused and has made a determination, on the basis of that information, of the extent to which he should be prosecuted.

The conspiracy distributed over 260 kilograms of cocaine. Yeje-Cabrera was also convicted of attempted possession with intent to distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1) and of bribery of a federal agent in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 201(b). These men, and others, distributed truckloads full of cocaine obtained from two Mexican suppliers; the drugs were driven from the Southwest to Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and New York. Yeje-Cabrera, of Westport, Massachusetts, was a principal in the operation and received a life sentence and a fine of $16 million. Yeje-Cabrera was also ordered to forfeit $5.2 million and two parcels of real property. P&#233;rez helped to distribute the cocaine and was an agent for Yeje-Cabrera. He was sentenced to thirty years' imprisonment and fined $4 million. Olivero, who lived in New York, collected the money, distributed cocaine, and assisted with the shipments. By contrast with the thirty-year sentence for P&#233;rez, Olivero was sentenced to 48 months' imprisonment, followed by five years of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yeje-Cabrera attacks his conviction and the forfeiture order. P&#233;rez attacks his conviction through a premature ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Olivero attacks his conviction.

It is the government's appeal which raises the most significant issues in the case. In order to sanction the government for what it considered to be impermissible \"fact bargaining,\" the district court declined to follow the Sentencing Guidelines. This was error. The fact bargaining was the government's willingness during earlier unsuccessful plea negotiations to recommend a lower sentence when the facts known to it at the time, or so the court found, justified a higher sentence. The court declined to give a warranted firearms enhancement and did give an unwarranted minimal-role reduction. The court also concluded, mistakenly, that its role as a fact finder with respect to drug quantity for sentencing purposes had been written out of the Sentencing Guidelines by the decision in <i>Apprendi v.

Statement of Facts and Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yeje-Cabrera was a leader of a conspiracy to ship cocaine from the Southwest to various states in the Northeast, where it was sold. P&#233;rez assisted with the distribution of cocaine. Olivero assisted with the collection of money and the distribution and shipping of cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two seizures of tractor-trailers full of cocaine provide the bookends for this case. In April of 2001, after using a camera to conduct surveillance of a parking lot in New York City, agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) seized a tractor-trailer containing over 300 kilograms of cocaine and over $400,000 in cash. The agents found a cellular telephone inside that contained telephone numbers for Yeje-Cabrera and Olivero. DEA agents then conducted surveillance of Yeje-Cabrera's home in Westport, Massachusetts via a hidden camera in a birdhouse, but Yeje-Cabrera discovered the camera and realized that he was under surveillance. Some time later, the DEA agents applied for and received permission to conduct electronic surveillance of Yeje-Cabrera's phone line. This initial wiretap application was followed by others seeking permission to conduct surveillance on multiple phone lines belonging to Yeje-Cabrera and another suspect. All were allowed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 2001, the INS<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> initiated removal proceedings in Boston against Yeje-Cabrera and detained him. He reacted by bribing an INS agent to terminate the proceedings and, in a series of recorded conversations, offering to pay another bribe for information regarding the drug investigation. Yeje-Cabrera was released on his own recognizance and resumed his drug business. P&#233;rez and Olivero, with Yeje-Cabrera, continued to arrange for and conduct the shipment of, payment for, and distribution of cocaine. Meanwhile, DEA agents were monitoring Yeje-Cabrera's phone lines and attempting to engage in other forms of surveillance. The agents prepared to move in on the operation on December 8, 2001, when Yeje-Cabrera and his associates were slated to receive a large shipment of cocaine near New Bedford, Massachusetts. DEA agents and state police were out in force that morning, searching for the participants in the anticipated delivery. As it happened, the drugs came to them: the ill-fated driver of the tractor-trailer, instead of making his delivery, accidentally backed into a state trooper's cruiser. Law enforcement agents seized the tractor-trailer and discovered that it contained 260 kilograms of cocaine. That seizure has the dubious distinction of being the largest drug seizure in Massachusetts history.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The conspiracy continued to receive and distribute cocaine for a short while longer. Finally, on December 21, 2001, officers arrested Yeje-Cabrera, P&#233;rez, and several other conspirators. Olivero ultimately turned himself in.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All three defendants were charged in the December 20, 2001 indictment with conspiracy to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A)(ii), and 846. Yeje-Cabrera was also charged with two additional crimes: attempted possession with intent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A)(ii), and 846, and bribery of a federal agent, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 201(b).

He argued that the affidavits submitted in support of the electronic surveillance applications failed to satisfy the \"necessity\" requirement of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2518(1)(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury convicted Yeje-Cabrera of all counts; it returned a special verdict, finding that he was responsible for more than 260 kilograms of cocaine on the conspiracy charge and exactly 260 kilograms on the attempt charge, and a forfeiture verdict. The jury convicted P&#233;rez of conspiracy to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine. It also convicted Olivero of conspiracy to distribute cocaine, though it did not attribute to him a specific drug quantity. That failure by the jury to make a specific finding led to some of the conviction and sentencing issues we discuss later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court sentenced Yeje-Cabrera to life imprisonment. It also fined him and, during sentencing, stated that it was \"allow[ing] the government's recommendation for forfeiture.\" The court sentenced P&#233;rez to 360 months' imprisonment and fined him $4 million. The court sentenced Olivero to 48 months of incarceration.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Discussion</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

One reason for this approach, Yeje-Cabrera suggests, is that &#167; 2518 imposes separate duties on separate actors: the applicant has an \"absolute\" duty under &#167; 2518(1)(c), while the issuing judge has a \"discretionary\" duty under &#167; 2518(3)(c).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Another reason for de novo review of the \"full and complete statement\" requirement, he argues, is that it would give effect to the necessity requirement: it would ensure that necessity is actually present, that the issuing judge is able to engage in an independent determination on that point, rather than one subject to the affiant's manipulation of the facts, and that meaningful appellate review is possible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though we recognize that other circuits have adopted bifurcated standards similar to that proposed by Yeje-Cabrera, <i>see, e.g., United States v.

First, Yeje-Cabrera's approach artificially separates two concepts that are a unified whole in the statute: \"full and complete statement,\" and \"necessity.\" One might ask: of what must the applicant provide a \"full and complete statement\"? The answer is: of \"whether or not other investigative procedures have been tried and failed or why they reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too dangerous.\" &#167; 2518(1)(c). This is one requirement, not two: a full and complete statement regarding necessity, that is, circumstances in which a wiretap, though disfavored as an investigative technique, is justified. <i>See United States v.

A <i>Franks</i> hearing, not de novo review in this court, is the proper route for addressing that concern. <i>Cf. Rivera-Rosario,</i> 300 F.3d at 20 (\"Material omissions in a government's application are ... sufficient to constitute the basis for a <i>Franks</i> evidentiary hearing.\" (citation omitted)). Yeje-Cabrera, however, did not pursue this option.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying our unitary standard of review, we inquire whether the affidavits satisfied the statutory requirement. After reviewing the sealed affidavits, we hold that they provided a sufficient basis for the issuing judge to authorize the wiretap. Without revealing any of the information for which it was appropriate to seal the affidavits, we note that the initial affidavit supplies a detailed overview of the investigation to date, concrete reasons why a wiretap was necessary, and thorough explanations of how traditional investigative techniques were proving, or were expected to prove, unlikely to succeed or dangerous. These representations were supported.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The initial affidavit could reasonably be thought to be more than adequate. After receiving authorization to conduct the first wiretap, the officers applied for and received authorization to conduct others and to extend some beyond the initial time period. As Yeje-Cabrera points out, the subsequent affidavits do overlap considerably with the initial affidavit and with each other, sometimes containing identical wording of some points. The last affidavit, seeking authorization to wiretap a telephone line over which officers expected to hear \"vital information\" on a large cocaine delivery expected to occur the next day, incorporates by reference the statement of necessity set out in a prior (attached) affidavit, instead of setting out a fresh one. Despite Yeje-Cabrera's characterization of the affidavits as consisting largely of \"boilerplate,\" all the affidavits did contain much that was concrete and pertained to this specific investigation. <i>See L&#243;pez,</i> 300 F.3d at 53-54 (rejecting defendant's argument that application was \"mere boilerplate\" where affidavit contained specific details about the investigation and about attempts to use less invasive surveillance techniques). We have reviewed these affidavits and find no flaws in the issuing court's determination that they were sufficient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yeje-Cabrera raises several objections to the conclusion that there was no abuse of discretion by the issuing judge in determining that the affidavits were sufficient. His primary argument is that a statement which appears in all of the affidavits constitutes an admission that the affiant \"expressly ignored the `full and complete statement' requirement.\" The officer applying for the wiretap authorization stated near the beginning of each affidavit:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since this Affidavit is being submitted for the limited purpose of securing an order authorizing the interception of wire communications, I have not included details of every aspect of this investigation to date. Facts not set forth herein are not being relied on in reaching my conclusion that an order should be issued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yeje-Cabrera argues that 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2518(1)(c) requires the application to describe \"all prior investigative steps undertaken.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The argument fundamentally misreads 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2518(1)(c). The requirement of a full and complete statement cannot possibly mean that every single detail, even if relevant to the wiretap, must be included. The plain language of &#167; 2518(1)(c) only requires a full and complete statement \"as to\" the crucial issue: \"whether or not other investigative procedures have been tried and failed or why they reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2518(1)(c). Many aspects of an investigation, especially in a large, complex case like this one, will not be relevant to the question of whether a particular wiretap is necessary. And even if there is some relevance, the officer need not detail every single fact, so long as sufficient facts are described as to the crucial issue and material contrary facts are not omitted. If there are relevant and material omissions, the issuing judge may deny the application or seek additional information, or the defendant may seek a <i>Franks</i> hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Yeje-Cabrera argues that the government did not do enough to exhaust traditional investigative methods before resorting to the wiretap. We have previously made clear, though, that \"the government need not demonstrate that it exhausted all investigative procedures.\" <i>Santana,</i> 342 F.3d at 65 (citing <i>L&#243;pez,</i> 300 F.3d at 52). The wiretap application simply \"must `demonstrate that the government has made a reasonable, good faith effort to run the gamut of normal investigative procedures before resorting to means so intrusive as electronic interception of telephone calls.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>United States v. London,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196355\"><a href=\"/opinion/196355/united-states-v-london/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1227</span></a></span>, 1237 (1st Cir.1995)); <i>see also Ashley,</i> 876 F.2d at 1072 (\"[T]he government is not required to show that other methods have been wholly unsuccessful. Nor is the government forced to run outlandish risks or to exhaust every conceivable alternative before requesting authorization for electronic surveillance.\" (citations omitted)). We conclude that the district court did not err in refusing to suppress the evidence obtained from the wiretaps.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Claim of Error in District Court Inquiry of Jurors</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yeje-Cabrera raises a claim of jury taint arising from a note that a juror sent to the judge. We review for abuse of discretion the claim that the trial court failed to conduct an appropriate inquiry into allegations of jury taint. <i>United States v. Paniagua-Ramos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773399\"><a href=\"/opinion/773399/united-states-v-daniel-paniagua-ramos/\"><span class=\"volume\">251</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">242</span></a></span>, 249 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the commencement of the trial, the district court instructed the jurors that they must not discuss the case with each other or with anyone else during the trial, that it was the government's burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the defendants were not obliged to testify or present any evidence. For the first ten days of trial, there was no inkling of anything awry with any juror. Then, during the eleventh day of trial, a juror sent a note to the judge. The note said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">WHY [ARE] THE DEFENDANTS NOT GOING TO BE CROSS-EXAMINED?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>4 DEFENDANTS SHOULD BE CROSS-EXAMINED!</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>THIS SHOULD BE DONE IN THIS CASE!</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court shared this note with counsel. Defense counsel urged the court to identify the juror, interview her and the other jurors individually to ascertain whether she had spoken with them, then excuse her. The court declined, opting instead to issue a strongly worded curative instruction on the burden of proof and on jurors' duty to refrain from discussion. The court instructed the members of the jury that if any of them could not follow these instructions, he or she was to speak with the clerk. It polled the jury as a group, asking for a show of hands on whether jurors had discussed the case among themselves. No juror admitted doing so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That night and the next morning, the juror who had sent the note to the judge communicated with the court and its clerk multiple times. She expressed that she was upset over the judge's handling of the note and that she still had opinions about the case that were consistent with her note. By the time trial was to resume on the twelfth day, the court had dismissed this juror and so informed counsel. Defense counsel again requested that the court interview the remaining jurors individually, but the court declined, stating that the jurors had already satisfactorily responded to the prior day's group inquiry, and that since that time they could have had no contact with the note-sending juror.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yeje-Cabrera's essential claim is that the juror who sent the note, although removed from the jury the next day, likely had expressed her strongly felt views to the other jurors and thus tainted the jury's deliberations. The court's response to the note, Yeje-Cabrera argues, was inadequate. In particular, he points to \"peer pressure,\" and to the fact that the court had just delivered a \"stinging rebuke\" to the jury, as factors rendering the show of hands unreliable. Even though the jurors unanimously indicated that they had followed the court's instructions not to discuss the case among themselves, he argues, the court did not do enough: under these circumstances, a juror who had not followed instructions could not be expected to raise a hand. He argues that the court should have individually interviewed the juror who sent the note and all the other members of the jury to ascertain whether they had followed instructions. Yeje-Cabrera further argues that the district court's method of handling the problem was so deficient as to require that the conviction be vacated: he claims that the district court could not \"do effective damage control,\" and that this court cannot engage in meaningful appellate review, because the district court's failure to conduct individualized inquiries deprived it and us of essential information. Such hyperbole does not win the day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This was a difficult situation and the trial judge acted well within the range of permissible options. Trial judges have a wide latitude in how to handle a claim of potential juror misconduct. <i>See Paniagua-Ramos,</i> 251 F.3d at 250 (\"[W]hile a trial court has an unflagging duty adequately to probe a nonfrivolous claim of jury taint, the court has wide discretion to determine the scope of the resulting inquiry and the mode and manner in which it will be conducted.\" (citations omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here the claim of taint is not about the juror who sent the note; she was dismissed after she said she could not continue in the case. The question is whether she tainted the others. Yeje-Cabrera draws the inference &#8212; from the emphatic nature of the juror's note to the judge &#8212; that the juror had disseminated her views to the other jurors, in violation of instructions. Moreover, he argues, her expressed views might have overridden in the other jurors' minds the court's strong curative instruction about the government's burden of proof.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the posited scenario is possible, we think that such inferences are not reasonable. During the show of hands, the juror who sent the note and the other jurors denied there had been discussions. We acknowledge that asking jurors en masse, before their peers, whether they have failed to comply with the court's instructions may tend to discourage an honest affirmative response. But the court also invited individual jurors to contact it afterwards, and none, other than the juror who sent the note, did so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the one juror had communicated her views to the other jurors, there is also no reason to think those jurors were dissuaded from following the instructions of the judge, much less that this somehow led jurors to penalize the defendants for their decision not to take the stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was no abuse of discretion. <i>Cf.

The jury was not asked to determine the quantity of drugs involved in the conspiracy as a whole. The court did, however, instruct the jury that the government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that each defendant joined \"this conspiracy\" &#8212; the one charged in the indictment, a \"wholesale\" rather than \"retail\" conspiracy to distribute cocaine. The indictment had alleged conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute \"more than 5 kilograms of cocaine.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From this, Olivero's counsel argues that unless the jury has found a specific quantity of drugs, a defendant cannot be guilty of conspiracy. He bases this argument on <i>United States v.

One very serious situation would be if the violation bespoke a lack of notice and opportunity for the defendant and third parties to object to a proposed forfeiture. <i>Cf. Pease,</i> 331 F.3d at 816 n. 18 (oral sentencing did not include forfeiture); <i>Petrie,</i> 302 F.3d at 1284 (forfeiture was not mentioned at sentencing hearing, written judgment merely stated that defendant was \"subject to forfeiture as cited\" in one count of the indictment, and preliminary forfeiture order was not entered until six months after sentencing).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That is not the situation here. The forfeiture claim was contained in the indictment, and the jury returned a special verdict finding that Yeje-Cabrera had derived the property \"directly or indirectly, as a result of the conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute.\" The presentence report mentions the forfeiture allegation in the indictment and states that the jury \"returned a verdict of guilty on all counts.\" The \"Sentencing Options\" section of the presentence report does not, however, mention forfeiture. Two months after the verdict, the government moved for a preliminary order of forfeiture; the motion was granted on February 24, 2003. Two days later, at sentencing, the district court stated that it was \"allow[ing] the government's recommendation for forfeiture.\" When the court said this, it must have been referring to a recommendation of a final order of forfeiture, since the preliminary order had already issued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For reasons which are unclear, no order of forfeiture was set forth in the judgment entered on March 3, or in the amended judgment entered on May 9, 2003. On August 14, 2003, the government moved for a final order of forfeiture. The government apparently did not realize that the \"must be included in the judgment\" requirement of Rule 32.2 had not been met, as it did not move to correct the judgment under Rule 36. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 36 (\"After giving any notice it considers appropriate, the court may at any time correct a clerical error in a judgment, order, or other part of the record, or correct an error in the record arising from oversight or omission.\"). On September 19, 2003, the court entered a final order of forfeiture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Importantly, it appears that Yeje-Cabrera never once opposed the merits of the proposed forfeiture. The government so represents, and Yeje-Cabrera does not represent to the contrary. Essentially, Yeje-Cabrera argues now that because there was a violation of Rule 32.2, he is entitled to reversal of the forfeiture order, which he had never opposed on the merits. We disagree.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There may be occasions when violations of Rules warrant a remedy of reversal. But the portion of Rule 32.2 which was violated here is largely a housekeeping rule and does not itself go to any fundamental rights of defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of the primary purposes of Rule 32.2, as its history shows, is to allow for the entry of a preliminary order of forfeiture. Before the 1996 Amendments, the predecessor Rule 32(d)(2) did not explicitly provide for such a preliminary forfeiture procedure. In 1996, Rule 32(d)(2) was amended to provide for the entry of a preliminary order of forfeiture after the forfeiture verdict and after \"providing notice to the defendant and a reasonable opportunity to be heard.\" The amendment added that \"[a]t sentencing, a final order of forfeiture shall be made part of the sentence and included in the judgment.\" This marks the first appearance of language similar to that relied upon by Yeje-Cabrera.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Advisory Committee Notes to the 1996 Amendments illustrate that the drafters were primarily concerned with enabling the government to obtain a preliminary order of forfeiture. The Notes cite three problems the new procedure avoids: delay in the government's locating and preserving forfeited assets, delay in third parties' ability to assert interests in the property, and the need to resort to restraining orders to maintain the status quo. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 32 advisory committee's notes (1996 amendments). The drafters do evince concern with protecting the defendant's interests, but do so by highlighting the defendant's right to notice and an opportunity to be heard, rather than by emphasizing the written judgment requirement. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 32.2 serves other efficiency interests as well, in particular, preserving the resources of the judicial system and of potentially interested third parties. The Advisory Committee Notes on Subdivision (b) of Rule 32.2 are concerned almost entirely with improving the procedure by which the relative ownership interests of the defendant and of third parties are determined. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.2 advisory committee's notes (2000 amendments). Tellingly, the Advisory Committee Notes do not focus on the written judgment requirement at all. Instead, they focus on explaining how the Rule avoids wasteful litigation. The Notes discuss how the coexistence of former Rule 31(e) with 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853(n) and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1963(<i>l</i>) caused duplicative proceedings to determine relative ownership interests in property subject to forfeiture, and they explain how the new procedure avoids that problem.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, Rule 32.2 also does serve interests of the defendant. In particular, the Rule ensures that all the penalties imposed on the defendant occur as part of a \"package,\" so that forfeiture is not imposed above and beyond a sentence that the court had already determined to be adequate. The Eleventh Circuit's observation in <i>Pease</i> puts the point well:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[F]orfeiture is part of the defendant's sentencing package for an obvious reason. The magnitude of the forfeiture may influence how the court treats the other parts of the package. For example, if forfeiture is sizeable, the court may impose a fine at the bottom of the Sentencing Guidelines' range or, if the forfeiture would render the defendant impecunious, perhaps no fine at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Pease,</i> 331 F.3d at 816 (discussing Rule 32, the predecessor to Rule 32.2, which in this respect was similar to the current Rule). On the facts of this case, mere failure to comply with Rule 32.2(b)(3)'s written judgment requirement does not harm this interest of the defendant. The district court included the forfeiture at the time it orally sentenced; the purpose of avoiding unduly large sentence/forfeiture \"packages\" was served here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court addressed the mirror image of our problem in <i>United States v.

In fact, the defendant had agreed at sentencing \"that he was not contesting forfeiture itself, but simply the amount over two million dollars,\" and he requested that this issue be resolved at a later hearing. <i>Id.</i> at 7. <i>Ferrario-Pozzi</i> pointed out that cases where the defendant did not receive adequate notice that a final order of forfeiture would be entered pose different concerns than cases where the defendant knew of this fact all along. <i>See id.</i> at 9.

Each argues that it was error for the district court to impose a sentence on the basis of facts found by the court by a preponderance of the evidence, but not found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. In Yeje-Cabrera's case, the alleged flaw was a sentence enhancement under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (U.S.S.G.) &#167; 3B1.1 based on the court's finding that he was \"the organizer, manager and leader of a large-scale drug organization including more than five individuals.\" In P&#233;rez's case, the jury stated in its special verdict form that P&#233;rez was responsible for five kilograms of cocaine, but the district court found that P&#233;rez was responsible for a drug quantity between 15 and 50 kilograms. It also imposed a sentence enhancement under U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1, based on its finding that P&#233;rez was a career offender.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> In Olivero's case, the claimed error arises from the district court's finding that Olivero was responsible for \"at least 499 grams\" of cocaine, when the jury verdict had attributed no particular drug quantity to Olivero.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These objections &#8212; that the judge, not the jury, found certain facts &#8212; misapprehend the law as it was eventually articulated in <i>United States v.

With a base offense level of 12 and a criminal history category of I, the high end of the Guidelines range would have been 16 months. <i>See United States v.

The district court's attribution to Olivero of a specific quantity of cocaine (\"at least 499 grams\") no more invalidates his sentence than it does his conviction. There was a period between <i>Blakely</i> and <i>Booker</i> when the district courts were forced to predict and improvise. Some courts, as the court did here, predicted wrongly that Sixth Amendment concerns required as a remedy that certain issues (for instance, drug quantity) be decided by a jury, not a judge. It is now well settled that this was wrong; the remedy was to make the Guidelines non-mandatory. <i>See Booker,</i> 125 S.Ct. at 756-57; <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 75.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since <i>Booker</i> we have made it clear that the district courts may make drug quantity determinations for sentencing purposes:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the 5-4 constitutional ruling in <i>Booker,</i> judge-made enhancements under the guidelines that result in a sentence greater than the sentence that could be imposed based solely on the facts found by the jury do amount to Sixth Amendment violations if the guidelines are treated as mandatory; but under the companion 5-4 remedial ruling in <i>Booker,</i> this problem is washed out by treating the guidelines as advisory.

First, the government argues that the district court erred in holding that <i>Apprendi</i> precluded it from finding a drug quantity above 499 grams (particularly in the face of evidence that Olivero was responsible for a considerably greater quantity of cocaine). Second, the government argues, the court erred in declining to follow the Guidelines in order to punish the prosecution for what the court considered to be impermissible fact bargaining. Specifically, the government takes issue with the court's decision to a) deny a firearms enhancement under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1), even though it found that the facts warranting the enhancement had been shown by a preponderance of the evidence, and b) grant a reduction in Olivero's offense level under &#167; 3B1.2(a) for being a minimal participant, when it was clear that Olivero was not a minimal participant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Olivero, a prime actor in the conspiracy, received only a 48-month sentence in the face of a statutory maximum of 20 years.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> The overall conspiracy involved possession with intent to distribute 260 kilograms of cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. <i>How the Court Arrived at Olivero's Sentence</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Olivero and 20 other defendants in this case were indicted on December 20, 2001. Before trial, there was a flurry of plea bargaining activity: in all, 15 of the 21 defendants pled guilty, seven \"on the very eve of trial.\" <i>Green,</i> 346 F.Supp.2d at 325.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 10, 2002, the probation office was asked to prepare a \"pre-plea\" presentence report for Olivero. Evidently this judge of the district court orders such \"pre-plea\" presentence reports as a matter of course. <i>See id.</i> at 279 (\"This court has burdened an already strained probation office by ordering pre-plea presentence reports in virtually every case as the best defense to illegal fact bargaining.\"). The \"pre-plea\" presentence report was prepared on October 29, 2002. It discussed the possibility of a minimal-role reduction for Olivero, but rejected it as not warranted on the evidence. It did not mention that Olivero had possessed a firearm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 14, 2002, the U.S. Attorney sent to Olivero's attorney the plea agreement that they had negotiated, and Olivero and his attorney signed the document on October 30, 2002. In the proposed agreement, there was no mention of a weapon or a weapons enhancement, and the government agreed not to oppose a minimal participant downward adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.2(a). At the time, the government was also negotiating agreements with a number of co-defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The proposed deal fell through on November 1, 2002, just before trial was to begin on November 4. Olivero withdrew from the deal when, at the hearing on acceptance of the plea, the court informed him that a plea would likely result in his immediate remand to custody. <i>Green,</i> 346 F.Supp.2d at 325. Olivero went to trial. Switching from its position during the plea agreement, the government presented evidence at trial tending to show that Olivero's role in the offense was more than minimal and connecting Olivero to a handgun whose ownership was in dispute. The jury returned its verdict, finding Olivero guilty, on December 12, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The post-conviction presentence report, dated April 10, 2003, states that a handgun was found in Olivero's bedroom, along with ammunition, 14.4 grams of cocaine, a scale, and a money-counting machine. Under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1), this meant a two-level enhancement applied.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> The Probation Office took the position that an adjustment for minimal role in the offense was not warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court first found Olivero responsible for \"at least 499 grams\" of cocaine, which led to a base offense level of 24. The court explained that because the jury left Olivero's drug quantity space blank on its verdict form, the jury must have found that the prosecution failed to prove as to him a quantity of 500 grams or more beyond a reasonable doubt. The court further stated that under <i>Apprendi,</i> a judge could not find a higher drug quantity on his own, by a mere preponderance of evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the court found that Olivero in fact possessed a gun in furtherance of the crime, but it declined to impose a sentence enhancement, citing what it viewed as the government's improper fact-bargaining, that is, an improper inconsistency between the government's willingness to ignore the gun enhancement as part of a plea agreement and its request for the gun enhancement after trial. The district court emphasized that the \"pre-plea\" presentence report did not mention a firearm. The court stated that the prosecution knew that a weapon had been found in Olivero's room \"before the preplea was entered into,\" and rejected the prosecution's argument that the facts necessary to prove gun possession became clearer as the prosecution prepared for and ultimately conducted the trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> As a result, the court punished the prosecution by refusing to enhance the sentence, even though the April 10, 2003 post-conviction presentence report had recommended the two-level U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1) firearm enhancement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the court addressed Olivero's role in the offense. If a defendant is a \"minimal\" participant in criminal activity, his offense level is to be decreased by four levels. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.2(a). If he is a \"minor\" participant, the reduction is two levels, and if his role is somewhere in between, the reduction is three levels. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 3B1.2. The court awarded Olivero a 4-point minimal-role reduction. It found that the government had offered to recommend this reduction as part of the proposed plea agreement and, in the court's view, had engaged in improper fact-bargaining by taking different positions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> In essence, the court stated, the prosecution's change of position had burdened Olivero's right to insist on a jury trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on these calculations, Olivero's Guidelines sentencing range was 33 to 41 months. The court departed upwards by seven months because Olivero was \"in with these people\" and not \"some bit player\" and because the conspiracy was extraordinarily extensive and dangerous &#8212; facts it considered not sufficiently reflected in the Guidelines range.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant had not advanced the arguments used by the district court to deny the gun enhancement or to grant the minimal participant downward departure. From what we can tell of the record, Olivero did <i>not</i> allege that the prosecution was retaliating against him for insisting on trial, much less offer any evidence in support of such a claim. Instead, the court raised the fact-bargaining issue <i>sua sponte.</i> It also placed the initial burden on the prosecution to explain itself.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 18, 2004, after the defendants had appealed their convictions and jurisdiction over their cases was in this court, the district court, <i>sua sponte,</i> published an 80-page advisory opinion (which it styled as a sentencing memorandum) in which it expanded upon its reasons for sanctioning the government. <i>See Green,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2568795\"><a href=\"/opinion/2568795/united-states-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">346</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The district court's <i>Apprendi</i> rationale for limiting its consideration of drug quantity was simply a wrong guess as to the direction the law would take. The district court was not \"constrained\" by the jury's verdict, as it thought it was, to finding less than 500 grams of cocaine. Instead, it could (and should) have found Olivero responsible for the amount of cocaine established by a preponderance of the evidence against him &#8212; though of course, the ultimate sentence may not exceed the statutory maximum of 20 years. That alone is reason to vacate the sentence and to remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We go on to address the government's claims of Guidelines and statutory error. <i>See Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 76.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ii. <i>Fact Bargaining</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court offered three rationales for its reduction of Olivero's sentence as a punishment of the prosecution for \"unconstitutional\" or \"illegal\" fact bargaining. The first rationale was that the defendant's right to trial by jury was impermissibly burdened by the government's change in position on the firearm enhancement and minimal role adjustment between plea bargaining and trial. The second was that the punishment was justified because the government somehow deceived the court. The third was that the Guidelines prohibited the government from doing what it did and the appropriate sanction was to give the defendant a lower sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court was attempting to address some aspects of the pre-<i>Booker</i> mandatory guidelines system which it considered particularly unfair and to address the power given to the prosecution by the Guidelines. The court is also passionate about protecting the right to trial by jury. That the court felt strongly is evidenced by the fact that it acted <i>sua sponte:</i> Olivero did not seek a reduction in his sentence on any of these grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Booker's</i> rendering of the Guidelines advisory (subject to restraints for reasonableness) may alleviate some of the concerns which motivated the court. In this case, however, none of the district court's rationales justify the sentence it imposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) <i>Fact Bargaining and the Right to a Jury Trial</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The term \"fact bargaining\" has been used loosely to cover a variety of situations, from affirmative misrepresentations to a court to more benign agreements by counsel to base sentencing on other factors. Fact bargaining may arise when there are different views of the facts, counsels' ability to prove them, and their consequences. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Sarner, \"<i>Fact Bargaining\" Under the Sentencing Guidelines: The Role of the Probation Department,</i> 8 Fed.

Still, there is a line, admittedly ambiguous, between an affirmative misrepresentation of facts presented at sentencing and how prosecutors (and defendants) handle unclear or less provable facts. <i>See</i> Gardner &amp; Rifkind, <i>A Basic Guide to Plea Bargaining Under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines,</i> 7 Crim. Just. 14, 16 (Summer 1992) (\"The stipulation cannot contain misleading facts.... Where facts are unclear or unascertainable, the parties may agree on some form of them without further justification or explanation to the court.\" (citation omitted) (citing U.S.S.G. &#167; 6B1.4(a)(2))).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p141\">\n      <span class=\"num\">141</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the prosecutor knew and could prove a gun enhancement at the time of the plea bargain, that fact would not make a difference to our analysis. No misrepresentation was made; rather, there was an omission, helpful to the defendant, which was an implicit part of the bargain. Rule 11(c)(1)(B) expressly contemplates that the attorney for the government can agree with the defendant's request that a sentencing factor does or does not apply, though this is not binding on the court. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1)(B). It was under that rule that Olivero's plea was tendered. If the defendant and the government have agreed on a sentence free of a possible enhancement, there is a significant question as to why they should be burdened with an obligation to disclose the evidence supporting the enhancement at a plea hearing. The obligation imposed by the Rule is to \"disclose the plea agreement.\" Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p142\">\n      <span class=\"num\">142</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A system of mandatory disclosure of all possible information at a plea hearing would not usually help defendants. Moreover, the costs of monitoring compliance with such a mandatory disclosure system are high, and many of the efficiencies created by plea bargaining would be lost. It would also lead to the blurring of roles. After all, the federal rules prohibit involvement by a trial judge in plea bargaining. This is true whether through the front door or the back. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1) (\"An attorney for the government and the defendant's attorney ... may discuss and reach a plea agreement. The court must not participate in these discussions.\"); <i>cf.</i> 1A C. Wright, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> &#167; 175.1 (3d ed. 1999) (\"That the defendant has accepted a bargain proposed by the prosecutor creates no constitutional right to have the bargain specifically enforced. `A plea bargain standing alone is without constitutional significance ....'\" (quoting <i>Mabry v.

The court, at the time of sentencing, did have all the facts before it on which to impose a sentence, and Olivero had fair notice of the issues. The prosecution had put on evidence at trial showing Olivero's ownership of the gun; Olivero in turn had pointed the finger at another defendant. The evidence was reviewed in the post-conviction presentence report, with Olivero objecting to the suggestion that he owned the gun and the probation office defending its stance. At sentencing, ownership of the gun was discussed yet again. The same abundance of evidence and debate characterized the issue of Olivero's role in the offense, culminating in the court's conclusion that Olivero was assuredly not \"some bit player\" or \"casual hanger-on,\" but rather was \"in with these people.\" There can be no suggestion that at the time of sentencing, the government was deceiving the court by hiding evidence of any sort, whether inculpatory or exculpatory.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a> The prosecution does not argue that it has a right to lie to a court and it did not do so here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p144\">\n      <span class=\"num\">144</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(c) <i>Fact Bargaining and Other Provisions of the Guidelines</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p145\">\n      <span class=\"num\">145</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also referred to other provisions of the Guidelines themselves as imposing an obligation on the government to disclose all information at the stage a court is considering a plea and not to change its position thereafter. This misreads the Guidelines. One argument from the Sentencing Guidelines is that &#167; 1B1.3 (\"Relevant Conduct\") specifies that the base offense level and adjustments be based on \"all acts and omissions committed, aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused by the defendant\" and \"all harm that resulted from\" those acts. U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3(a)(1)(A), (3). There is no claim that the government did not provide such information at sentencing. Ironically, the district court sanctioned the government because it <i>did</i> advance exactly such evidence of relevant conduct at sentencing. By its terms, U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3 concerns what the court should do with the information before it at sentencing and does not create a set of sanctions against the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p146\">\n      <span class=\"num\">146</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other Guidelines concern arises from Application Note 1 to U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.8 (\"Use of Certain Information\"), which simply makes it clear that that particular Guideline does not authorize the government to withhold information from the court. In any case, there is no evidence here that Olivero provided self-incriminating information that the prosecution withheld from the court, so &#167; 1B1.8 is inapplicable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p147\">\n      <span class=\"num\">147</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(d) <i>Summary</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p148\">\n      <span class=\"num\">148</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecution's conduct here transgressed no norm, constitutional or legal. There was no cause to punish the prosecution at all. We defer until some other case the question of whether a district court may ever reduce a defendant's sentence as a sanction against the government for its conduct in earlier negotiating a plea which is not accepted. But we do note that the sentencing objectives set by the statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a)(2), refer to punishment of the offender, deterrence of <i>crime,</i> protection of the public, and rehabilitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p149\">\n      <span class=\"num\">149</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentencing of Olivero is vacated and the matter is remanded to the district court. Olivero thus will be resentenced in a post-<i>Booker</i> regime in which the Guidelines are no longer mandatory. We have reversed each of the rationales relied on by the district court, in the government's sentencing appeal, as a matter of law. This means that any reliance upon them at resentencing would be inherently unreasonable. <i>See Booker,</i> 125 S.Ct. at 765-66.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.

The court cited concerns about the appropriate drug quantity to attribute to Olivero in light of<i>Apprendi</i> and other authorities, and it stated that it was going to schedule a new sentencing hearing. Upon being told by the government that it lacked jurisdiction, the court vacated its attempt to vacate Olivero's sentence. The court did proceed, however, to issue what was in essence a sentencing memorandum pertaining not only to Olivero's case but also to several other unrelated criminal cases, explaining in more detail its reasons for the sentence it had imposed on Olivero and its belief that the maximum constitutionally permissible sentence for Olivero was 16 months. <i>United States v.

The prosecution renewed its objection after the court instructed the jury. The defense attorneys did not object on the drug-quantity point, and Yeje-Cabrera's attorney said he preferred the court's proposition. Olivero's attorney made some requests about jury instructions, but none pertaining to the drug-quantity issue. After the jury was instructed, Olivero's attorney objected to the court's telling the jury that drug quantity was a sentencing issue, saying he would have preferred for the court to say that the amount went to \"other reasons or other legal reasons.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The maximum is higher if additional facts are present<i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(C).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> We bypass the government's argument that by failing to oppose entry of the post-judgment final order of forfeiture, at best Yeje-Cabrera is entitled to plain error review.

If so, the record refutes the argument easily. The court found that P&#233;rez was a \"career offender, having had two prior convictions of either a crime of violence or [a] controlled substance violation.\"<i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1(a). Under U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1(b), the offense level provided by the career offender subsection or the otherwise applicable offense level, whichever is greater, must be applied. The table in that subsection provides that if the statutory maximum for the offense is life imprisonment, then the offense level is 37. Here, the statutory maximum was life, as provided by 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846 (conspiracy to commit an offense is punished the same as the offense itself) and &#167; 841(b)(1)(A)(ii) (distribution of five kilograms or more of cocaine subjects the offender to a maximum penalty of life in prison). Therefore, the offense level was 37 under the career offender table, and this was greater than the otherwise applicable offense level of 34, so it was the correct level to apply under the career offender Guideline. Under U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1(b), \"[a] career offender's criminal history category in every case under this subsection shall be Category VI.\" With a total offense level of 37 and a criminal history of Category VI, the Guidelines range was thirty years to life in prison.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Olivero also challenges his sentence by claiming that the district court abused its discretion when it imposed an upward departure of seven months. Under U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.0, the sentencing court may depart where there are aggravating or mitigating circumstances \"of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.0(a)(1) (Policy Statement). Olivero argues that it was error to depart on the basis of his role in the offense, because it was already adequately addressed under the Guidelines. It is clear, though, that the district court not only could have, but would have, departed on the sole basis of the other ground it cited: the extraordinary extent and danger of the conspiracy. Contrary to Olivero's assertion that it was just a \"run of the mill\" conspiracy, the evidence at trial showed that this conspiracy involved a multistate network of players, sophisticated tactics, and record-setting quantities of cocaine</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> The presentence report for P&#233;rez states that \"[t]he defendant did not bring the requested financial information to the presentence interview.

At sentencing, Olivero's attorney simply followed the court's lead, expressing agreement with the court's view that the government knew all along about the gun.

At this stage of the proceedings, the prosecutor's assessment of the proper extent of prosecution may not have crystallized. In contrast, once a trial begins &#8212; and certainly by the time a conviction has been obtained &#8212; it is much more likely that the State has discovered and assessed all of the information against an accused and has made a determination, on the basis of that information, of the extent to which he should be prosecuted.
