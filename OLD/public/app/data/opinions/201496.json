Patti B. Saris, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                         Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                  Selya and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Stephen Hrones, with whom Hrones, Garrity & Hedges was on\nbrief, for appellants.\n     Anita Johnson, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nMichael J.

This case arises out of a series\n\nof    apparent    blunders    on    the   part    of   the   Federal   Bureau   of\n\nInvestigation (FBI), leading to the wrongful conviction of two men\n\non bank robbery charges.           After the truth came to light, the trial\n\ncourt set aside the convictions.                The men then sued the United\n\nStates under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. §§\n\n1346(b), 2671-2680.       Following a bench trial, the district court\n\ndenied relief.       See Bolduc v. United States, 265 F. Supp. 2d 153\n\n(D.    Mass.     2003).      The    court    acknowledged     the   government's\n\njurisdictional challenges but opted to decide the case on the\n\nmerits.    See id. at 154.\n\n               On appeal, we think it more orderly to treat the question\n\nof jurisdiction as a threshold matter.             Concluding, as we do, that\n\nthe FTCA does not support the assertion of federal subject matter\n\njurisdiction, we affirm the judgment on that alternative ground.\n\nI.    BACKGROUND\n\n               The chronicle of relevant events takes us back more than\n\nsixteen years.       We recount the facts as supportably found by the\n\ndistrict court.       See id. at 155-69.\n\n               On June 28, 1988, two middle-aged white men attempted to\n\nrob a branch of the First Wisconsin Bank situated at the Southgate\n\nMall in Greenfield, Wisconsin.              The FBI mounted an investigation\n\ninto the Southgate incident.              Agent Daniel Craft led the probe.\n\nBecause the thieves came away from Southgate empty-handed, Craft\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\fconsidered the crime a \"nothing robbery\" and delegated substantial\n\ninvestigative responsibility to a rookie, Agent Derrel Craig.\n\n           On November 15, 1988, Craft and Craig rounded up four\n\nSouthgate eyewitnesses and showed them a photographic array.                       The\n\narray did not include pictures of either the appellants or the men\n\nwho   ultimately    were     determined      to     be    the    actual    culprits.\n\nNevertheless, two of the four eyewitnesses selected the photographs\n\nof Allan Daniel Wilwerding and Douglas Wayne Thompson as depictions\n\nof the robbers, and another eyewitness fingered Wilwerding.                        The\n\nagents recorded     the     results    in    separate      memos,    known   in    FBI\n\nparlance as 302 reports.             The two sets of reports attributed\n\ndifferent levels of certitude to the eyewitness identifications:\n\nCraft's   reports      indicated     that    two     of   the     eyewitnesses     had\n\ndescribed Wilwerding and Thompson as \"similar\" to the robbers\n\nwhereas   Craig's      reports     noted     that     those      eyewitnesses      had\n\nidentified the men as \"identical\" to the robbers.                        The reports\n\nregarding the eyewitness who had identified only Wilwerding were\n\nalso inconsistent; again, Craft's report attributed a \"similar\"\n\nidentification to that eyewitness whereas Craig's report recorded\n\nan \"identical\" match.\n\n           As   lead      investigator,      Craft    bore      responsibility     for\n\nfinalizing   the    302    reports    by    reviewing      them    for    errors   and\n\ninitialing them. According to FBI policy, once Craft finalized the\n\n302 reports, he was required to place them in the case file.                       The\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fcourt below found that, in this instance, Craft ignored this policy\n\nand excluded Craig's 302 reports from the case file because he\n\nunilaterally decided that they inaccurately reported the strength\n\nof the identifications.          Id. at 157.      The court also found it\n\ndoubtful that Craft's 302 reports were in the case file when the\n\nFBI turned it over to the United States Attorney.                  Id.    It is\n\nundisputed    that    FBI   agents    have   no   discretion      to    withhold\n\nparticular 302 reports from a case file.           See id.\n\n          On October 18, 1989, two middle-aged white men stuck up\n\nthe Oklahoma Avenue branch of the First Wisconsin Bank in Milwaukee\n\nand absconded with $400,000.          Agent Craft again took the lead in\n\nthe ensuing investigation.         This time, however, his aide-de-camp\n\nwas Agent Margaret Cronin. The general description of the Oklahoma\n\nAvenue perpetrators reminded Cronin, a Boston native, of an article\n\nshe had read in a Boston newspaper describing arrests in Lowell,\n\nMassachusetts,       following   an   armored     car   robbery    in     nearby\n\nChelmsford. Those arrested included two middle-aged white men, and\n\nCronin thought that she perceived some similarities.\n\n             In early 1990, on Cronin's initiative, the Milwaukee\n\noffice of the FBI included photographs of plaintiffs-appellants\n\nFrank Bolduc and Francis Larkin (each of whom had been detained in\n\nconnection with the Chelmsford armored car robbery) in an array\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fdisplayed to the Southgate and Oklahoma Avenue eyewitnesses.1          Some\n\nwitnesses identified Bolduc and/or Larkin as the culprits; others\n\nwere unable to make any positive identifications at that time.\n\nEncouraged to some extent by these results, the FBI arranged to\n\nhave the appellants transported to Wisconsin and placed them in a\n\nlineup. Several (but not all) of the eyewitnesses to the Southgate\n\nand Oklahoma Avenue incidents identified them as the robbers.             A\n\nfederal grand jury, sitting in Milwaukee, subsequently indicted the\n\nappellants for the attempted armed robbery of Southgate and the\n\narmed robbery of Oklahoma Avenue, see 18 U.S.C. § 2113, and for\n\nrelated firearms offenses, see id. § 924(c)(1).\n\n          The   trial   went   forward    in   February   of   1991.   The\n\nprosecution   relied    entirely   upon    eyewitness     identifications,\n\nincluding the testimony of the same three witnesses who previously\n\nhad identified others (Wilwerding and Thompson) as \"similar\" or\n\n\"identical\" to the Southgate bandits; this time, the trio made\n\npositive identifications of Bolduc and/or Larkin.              Neither the\n\nprosecutor nor the witnesses themselves mentioned their earlier\n\n(inconsistent) match-ups.      The defense relied mainly upon alibi\n\ntestimony indicating that the appellants were in the Boston area\n\nwhen the crimes were committed.          The jury found the appellants\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Larkin died while this suit was pending and the administrator\nof his estate has been substituted as a party plaintiff in his\nplace and stead. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(a).\n\n                                   -5-\n\fguilty of all charges and, on May 24, 1991, the district court\n\nsentenced both men to serve lengthy prison terms.2\n\n               Following the imposition of sentence, federal officials\n\nreturned Bolduc to a Massachusetts state penitentiary to resume\n\nserving    a    life   sentence   for   an    earlier   second-degree   murder\n\nconviction, which the parole board had reinstated upon Bolduc's\n\narrest for his putative involvement in the Chelmsford armored car\n\nrobbery.        Upon learning of the federal convictions, however,\n\nMassachusetts authorities decided to dismiss the charges pending\n\nagainst Bolduc and Larkin with respect to the armored car caper.\n\nIn their view, the appellants' ages and the length of their federal\n\nsentences contradicted the need to seek additional prison time.\n\nDespite this decision, the Massachusetts parole board determined\n\nthat Bolduc's federal conviction furnished sufficient grounds to\n\nsupport the revocation of his parole and, therefore, he remained in\n\nstate prison.\n\n               Notwithstanding      the       appellants'     arrests      and\n\nincarceration, similar robberies continued to plague Midwestern\n\nbanks.     More than six years after the appellants were sentenced,\n\n\n     2\n      The court sentenced Bolduc to 280 months for the attempted\nrobbery at Southgate (count 1), 60 months for a related firearms\ncharge (count 2), 280 months for the Oklahoma Avenue robbery (count\n3), and 240 months for a related firearms charge (count 4). The\nsentences on counts 1 and 3 were to run concurrently, followed by\nthe sentence for count 2 and, finally, the sentence for count 4.\nThe court sentenced Larkin to concurrent terms for counts 1 and 3\n(each 90 months), followed by a consecutive 60-month term for count\n2 and a further consecutive 240-month term for count 4.\n\n                                        -6-\n\fthe FBI arrested William Kirkpatrick on suspicion of involvement in\n\nseveral of the more recent robberies.           Though incarcerated, Bolduc\n\ncaught wind of this turn of events and asked Kirkpatrick's attorney\n\nfor any available information about the Southgate and Oklahoma\n\nAvenue robberies.       The lawyer sent Bolduc a packet containing,\n\ninter alia, Agent Craig's 302 reports anent the November 1988 photo\n\narray.    It was in that roundabout way that Bolduc first learned of\n\nthis exculpatory evidence.        Larkin learned of the evidence at an\n\neven later date.\n\n            In time, Kirkpatrick confessed that he and a partner had\n\nundertaken both the Southgate and Oklahoma Avenue heists.                  The\n\nappellants filed federal habeas petitions, see 28 U.S.C. § 2255,\n\nwhich the government did not oppose.            On June 11, 1999, a federal\n\ndistrict judge granted the petitions, vacated the appellants'\n\nsentences, and issued certificates of innocence.                   Larkin was\n\nreleased    from   federal     custody    and    Bolduc,   relying    on   the\n\ncertificate of innocence, successfully petitioned the Massachusetts\n\nparole board for reinstatement of his parole.\n\nII.   TRAVEL OF THE CASE\n\n            Following their release, the appellants commenced a civil\n\naction in the United States District Court for the District of\n\nMassachusetts in an effort to recover money damages for the eight\n\nyears    that   they   had   languished   in    prison.    Their     complaint\n\npresented claims under the FTCA against the United States for\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fmalicious prosecution, false imprisonment, abuse of process, and\n\nnegligent supervision, as well as a Bivens claim against Agent\n\nCraft, see Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of FBN, 403 U.S. 388,\n\n389     (1971).         The   district      court    dismissed      the   malicious\n\nprosecution, abuse of process, and false imprisonment counts for\n\nfailure to state claims upon which relief could be granted, see\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), and dismissed the Bivens claim for want\n\nof in personam jurisdiction, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2).                  None of\n\nthese rulings have been contested on appeal and we abjure any\n\nfurther discussion of them.3          Withal, the district court permitted\n\nthe negligent supervision claim to go forward and subsequently\n\nallowed the appellants to add a straight negligence claim under the\n\nFTCA.     Both claims were premised on the allegation that the FBI's\n\nwithholding       of    the   above-described       302   reports    deprived   the\n\nappellants of the benefit of exculpatory evidence before and during\n\nthe criminal trial, and thus led to their wrongful convictions.\n\n             The       parties   engaged    in   extensive    discovery.        The\n\ngovernment challenged the existence of subject matter jurisdiction\n\nfor the first time in a motion served almost two months after the\n\ndeadline for filing dispositive motions had passed. Subject matter\n\njurisdiction is not waivable, and a party cannot confer subject\n\n\n      3\n      On October 21, 2002, the lower court granted the appellants'\nmotion to transfer the claim against Craft to the United States\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. The docket\nof that court does not indicate that the appellants ever perfected\nthe transfer.\n\n                                           -8-\n\fmatter jurisdiction upon a federal court by failing to assert that\n\ndefense in a timely manner.         See Quinn v. City of Boston, 325 F.3d\n\n18, 26 (1st Cir. 2003); Irving v. United States, 162 F.3d 154, 160\n\n(1st Cir. 1998) (en banc).         Still, the belated filing of a motion\n\nto   dismiss   for   want    of   subject    matter    jurisdiction   can    have\n\nconsequences in terms of a court's case-management decisions.                 So\n\nit was here:    the district court elected to withhold consideration\n\nof the jurisdictional issue until after the trial.\n\n            The appellants' two remaining claims — negligence and\n\nnegligent supervision under the FTCA — were tried to the district\n\ncourt for four days. The court then requested post-trial briefing.\n\nThe government's memorandum raised a litany of defenses, including\n\na renewed plea that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.\n\n            On July 2, 2003, the district court filed a lengthy\n\nrescript in which it ordered judgment in favor of the United States\n\non the ground that the appellants had not proved that the FBI's\n\nfailure to provide the exculpatory 302 reports had harmed them.\n\nSee Bolduc, 265 F. Supp. 2d at 154, 171.              The court's rationale is\n\ncomplicated, see id. at 154, 169-71, and the appellants bitterly\n\ndispute it.     We need not set foot on that battlefield:              federal\n\ncourts are courts of limited jurisdiction and, in the circumstances\n\nof   this   case,    we     consider   ourselves      bound   to   address    the\n\njurisdictional issue first, regardless of the government's failure\n\n\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fto raise it in a more timely fashion.4             See Irving, 162 F.3d at 160\n\n(admonishing          that   the    federal     courts    \"have     an    affirmative\n\nobligation       to    examine      jurisdictional       concerns    on    their   own\n\ninitiative\" even if the parties have neglected them); Berner v.\n\nDelahanty, 129 F.3d 20, 23 (1st Cir. 1997) (noting \"that a court\n\nshould       first     confirm     the   existence       of   rudiments     such   as\n\njurisdiction . . . before tackling the merits of a controverted\n\ncase\").       As matters turn out, resolution of that issue terminates\n\nthis appeal.\n\nIII.       SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION\n\n               Consistent with the foregoing, we turn directly to the\n\njurisdictional issue.              We begin with first principles:             it is\n\napodictic that \"[a]s a sovereign nation, the United States is\n\nimmune from liability except to the extent that it consents to\n\nsuit.\"       Dynamic Image Techs., Inc. v. United States, 221 F.3d 34,\n\n39 (1st Cir. 2000).                The FTCA evinces a waiver of sovereign\n\nimmunity with respect to certain categories of torts committed by\n\n\n\n       4\n      We recognize that, in some circumstances, a court may avoid\na jurisdictional quandary if a tidier resolution on the merits will\ndispose of the case in favor of the party challenging jurisdiction.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Stoller, 78 F.3d 710, 715 (1st Cir.\n1996). That is a narrow exception, however, especially in view of\na federal court's \"special obligation to 'satisfy itself not only\nof its own jurisdiction, but also that of the lower courts in a\ncause under review.'\" Bender v. Williamsport Area Sch. Dist., 475\nU.S. 534, 541 (1986) (quoting Mitchell v. Maurer, 293 U.S. 237, 244\n(1934)); accord Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't, 523 U.S.\n83, 94 (1998). In this case, we deem it prudent to hew to the\ngeneral rule rather than the long-odds exception to it.\n\n                                         -10-\n\ffederal employees in the scope of their employment.   See 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1346(b)(1). It simultaneously grants the federal district courts\n\njurisdiction over such claims.    See id.; see also FDIC v. Meyer,\n\n510 U.S. 471, 475-77 (1994).   Thus, we must determine whether this\n\nwaiver of sovereign immunity extends to the appellants' claims of\n\nnegligence and negligent supervision, so that those claims fall\n\nwithin the jurisdictional grant of section 1346(b)(1).     See Meyer,\n\n510 U.S. at 477.\n\n          That grant extends to claims\n\n          against the United States, for money damages,\n          accruing on and after January 1, 1945, for\n          injury or loss of property, or personal injury\n          or death caused by the negligent or wrongful\n          act or omission of any employee of the\n          Government while acting within the scope of\n          his office or employment, under circumstances\n          where the United States, if a private person,\n          would be liable to the claimant in accordance\n          with the law of the place where the act or\n          omission occurred.\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1346(b)(1).   A further explication of the last clause\n\nis to be found in 28 U.S.C. § 2674, which provides that the United\n\nStates only \"shall be liable . . . in the same manner and to the\n\nsame extent as a private individual under like circumstances.\"      A\n\nbundle of exceptions, mostly in the nature of exclusions and carve-\n\nouts, circumscribes the FTCA's waiver of sovereign immunity.     See\n\n\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\f28 U.S.C. § 2680(a)-(n); see also Dynamic Image Techs., 221 F.3d at\n\n39.5\n\n            We add a caveat.     As with all waivers of sovereign\n\nimmunity, the FTCA must be \"construed strictly in favor of the\n\nfederal government, and must not be enlarged beyond such boundaries\n\nas its language plainly requires.\"      United States v. Horn, 29 F.3d\n\n754, 762 (1st Cir. 1994).    With this principle firmly in mind, we\n\nundertake our jurisdictional analysis.\n\n            As said, the appellants prosecuted two FTCA claims:    one\n\nfor negligence (based on Agent Craft's alleged failure to include\n\nthe above-described 302s in the case file turned over to federal\n\nprosecutors and ultimately to the defense) and one for negligent\n\nsupervision (based on the alleged failure of Craft’s superiors to\n\n\n\n\n       5\n      Only two of these exceptions are relevant to this case. They\nstate in pertinent part that the provisions of the FTCA shall not\napply to:\n\n       (a) Any claim based upon an act or omission of an\n       employee of the Government . . . based upon the exercise\n       or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a\n       discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal\n       agency . . . .\n\n                         *        *          *\n\n       (h) Any claim arising out of assault, battery, false\n       imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, abuse\n       of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit, or\n       interference with contract rights [subject to certain\n       provisos] . . . .\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2680(a), (h).\n\n                                 -12-\n\foversee him more closely).    We consider the jurisdictional bona\n\nfides of each claim separately.\n\n                    A.   The Negligence Claim.\n\n          The \"law of the place\" provides the substantive rules to\n\nbe used in deciding FTCA actions.     28 U.S.C. § 1346(b)(1).   The\n\nphrase \"law of the place\" refers to the law of the state in which\n\nthe allegedly tortious acts or omissions occurred.   See Meyer, 510\n\nU.S. at 478; Castro v. United States, 775 F.2d 399, 405 (1st Cir.\n\n1985) (per curiam). Federal constitutional or statutory law cannot\n\nfunction as the source of FTCA liability.   See Meyer, 510 U.S. at\n\n478 (holding that \"the United States simply has not rendered itself\n\nliable under § 1346(b) for constitutional tort claims\"); Sea Air\n\nShuttle Corp. v. United States, 112 F.3d 532, 536-37 (1st Cir.\n\n1997) (explaining that there can be no FTCA jurisdiction where the\n\nchallenged government conduct has no parallel in the private sector\n\nand the asserted liability arises from a federal statutory or\n\nregulatory obligation with no comparable common law principle under\n\nwhich private persons would be held liable); Zabala Clemente v.\n\nUnited States, 567 F.2d 1140, 1149 (1st Cir. 1978) (establishing\n\nthat \"even where specific behavior of federal employees is required\n\nby federal statute, liability to the beneficiaries of that statute\n\nmay not be founded on the Federal Tort Claims Act if state law\n\nrecognizes no comparable private liability\").    It follows that the\n\nappellants cannot premise jurisdiction on the rule of Brady v.\n\n\n                               -13-\n\fMaryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963),6 but, rather, must look to Wisconsin\n\nlaw and must identify in that body of jurisprudence a basis for\n\nholding a private person liable in tort for acts and omissions\n\ncomparable to those committed (or, at least, allegedly committed)\n\nby Agent Craft.          See Davric Me. Corp. v. U.S. Postal Serv., 238\n\nF.3d 58, 64 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n             To      maintain    a      cause    of    action    for    negligence         in\n\nWisconsin, a plaintiff must show \"(1) [a] duty of care on the part\n\nof    the   defendant;     (2)      a   breach    of    that    duty;       (3)    a   causal\n\nconnection between the conduct and the injury; and (4) an actual\n\nloss or damage as a result of the injury.\"                      Rockweit v. Senecal,\n\n541    N.W.2d     742,   747     (Wis.     1995).       Building       on    this      fairly\n\nconventional formulation, the appellants argue that Agent Craft's\n\nfailure to ensure the turnover of exculpatory evidence constituted\n\na breach of a duty cognizable under Wisconsin tort law.\n\n             To satisfy the duty prong, the appellants rely in part on\n\nthe duty of state government (and, particularly, state prosecutors)\n\nto disclose exculpatory evidence. See, e.g., Appellants' Reply Br.\n\nat    5-6   (citing      Wis.    Stat.     §     971.23(1)).        This          effort   is\n\nunconvincing.         By the FTCA's plain terms, a waiver of sovereign\n\nimmunity attaches only where \"a private person[] would be held\n\nliable.\"        28    U.S.C.    §    1346(b)(1)        (emphasis   supplied).              The\n\n\n       6\n      Broadly stated, Brady imposes a constitutional duty on\nprosecutors to turn over exculpatory evidence to a defendant in a\ncriminal case. See Brady, 373 U.S. at 87.\n\n                                           -14-\n\fappellants have not pointed to any instance in which Wisconsin has\n\nimposed private liability on a prosecutor or other state agent for\n\na failure to disclose exculpatory evidence.      That is a fatal flaw,\n\nfor the federal government does not yield its immunity with respect\n\nto obligations that are peculiar to governments or official-\n\ncapacity state actors and which have no private counterpart in\n\nstate law.     See Franco de Jerez v. Burgos, 947 F.2d 527, 528 (1st\n\nCir. 1991) (speaking in terms of the negligence of government\n\nemployees as such is insufficient to satisfy the FTCA's \"private\n\nperson\" requirement); DiMella v. Gray Lines of Boston, Inc., 836\n\nF.2d 718, 720 (1st Cir. 1988) (stating that \"[w]hatever liability\n\n[a state] may have chosen to assume for itself as a matter of\n\ngovernmental policy has no bearing on the liability of . . .\n\nprivate   persons,    the   standard    the   federal   government   has\n\naccepted\"). Because Wisconsin's recognition of a governmental duty\n\nto disclose exculpatory evidence does not ground private liability\n\nunder that state's law, it cannot serve as a hook on which to hang\n\nfederal jurisdiction here.\n\n             This conclusion does not end our inquiry. We nonetheless\n\nmust inquire whether there is any way in which Wisconsin might\n\nimpose tort liability upon a private party under circumstances\n\nsufficiently similar to those present in this case, that is, a\n\nperson who comes into possession of exculpatory evidence as part of\n\nan official investigation and carelessly fails to disclose that\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fevidence to prosecutors (and, ultimately, to the accused).                 This\n\nmeans, in effect, that we must look for \"some relationship between\n\nthe governmental employee[s] and plaintiff to which state law would\n\nattach a duty of care in purely private circumstances.\"               Sea Air\n\nShuttle, 112 F.3d at 537 (citation and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n            In formulating its test for negligence, Wisconsin has\n\nadopted a broad definition of the element of duty.           See A. E. Inv.\n\nCorp. v. Link Builders, Inc., 214 N.W.2d 764, 766 (Wis. 1974)\n\n(explaining that Wisconsin has embraced a rationale that recognizes\n\na duty wherever harm is foreseeable).       As a result of this choice,\n\nWisconsin courts, rather than examining the relationship between\n\nthe parties to determine the existence vel non of a duty, focus on\n\nthe foreseeability of harm in order to ascertain whether a duty\n\narises.     This   means   that   \"[t]he   duty   of   any   person   is    the\n\nobligation of due care to refrain from any act which will cause\n\nforeseeable harm to others even though the nature of that harm and\n\nthe identity of the harmed person or harmed interest is unknown at\n\nthe time of the act.\"      Id.\n\n            This formulation casts a wide net. Indeed, the Wisconsin\n\nSupreme Court — the most authoritative arbiter of Wisconsin law —\n\nhas ruminated that \"[i]n Wisconsin, everyone has a duty of care to\n\nthe whole world.\" Miller v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 580 N.W.2d 233,\n\n238 (Wis. 1998).     In these general terms, then, a private person\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\fmight be said to owe a duty to a person suspected of crime — the\n\nduty being to exercise due care in the handling of exculpatory\n\nevidence     so   as    to    prevent       the     foreseeable     harm    of    wrongful\n\nconviction. Cf. Bowen v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co., 517 N.W.2d 432,\n\n439 (Wis. 1994) (\"Wisconsin law considers conduct to be negligent\n\nif it involves a foreseeable risk of harm to anyone.\").\n\n             Even if we assume the existence of such a duty, that\n\nassumption does not take the appellants as far as they need to go.\n\nUnder the FTCA, the relevant inquiry is not whether state law might\n\nassign   a   duty       to    a    private    person     in   the    same    or    similar\n\ncircumstances,         but,       rather,    whether     state      law    would    impose\n\nliability on a private person in the same or similar circumstances.\n\nSee 28 U.S.C. §§ 1346(b)(1), 2674.                     The stating of a claim for\n\nnegligence (the failure to exercise due care by one having a\n\ngeneral duty to do so in the face of foreseeable harm) does not\n\nautomatically mean that liability would attach under Wisconsin law.\n\nThe contrary is true:               \"[i]n Wisconsin, the doctrine of public\n\npolicy, not the doctrine of duty, limits the scope of a defendant's\n\nliability.\"       Bowen, 517 N.W.2d at 439; see also Rockweit, 541\n\nN.W.2d at 750 (stating that \"the determination to deny liability is\n\nessentially       one    of       public     policy    rather       than    of    duty   or\n\ncausation\"); Schuster v. Altenberg, 424 N.W.2d 159, 164 (Wis. 1988)\n\n(\"[O]nce it is determined that a negligent act has been committed\n\nand that the act is a substantial factor in causing the harm, the\n\n\n                                             -17-\n\fquestion of duty is irrelevant and a finding of nonliability can be\n\nmade only in terms of public policy.\").                 Because the measure for\n\ndetermining the federal government's consent to suit under the FTCA\n\nis a private person's potential liability under state law, we turn\n\nto Wisconsin's doctrine of public policy.\n\n            The question of whether public policy precludes tort\n\nliability is \"a question of law solely for judicial decision.\"\n\nMorgan v. Pa. Gen. Ins. Co., 275 N.W.2d 660, 667 (Wis. 1979).                  The\n\nWisconsin Supreme Court has enumerated six factors relevant to this\n\ndetermination.       See Miller, 580 N.W.2d at 240.            We need not call\n\nthe roll, however, as that court has decided a case directly on\n\npoint     dealing    with     a   private      person    in   markedly    similar\n\ncircumstances.       We look to that decision for guidance.\n\n            In Bromund v. Holt, 129 N.W.2d 149 (Wis. 1964), the\n\nplaintiff brought an action in negligence against a doctor, in his\n\nprivate     capacity,       for   careless      performance    of    an   autopsy\n\ncommissioned by law enforcement officers in the course of their\n\ninvestigation into the death of the plaintiff's wife.                Id. at 150-\n\n51. The plaintiff asserted that the doctor's negligent performance\n\nof the autopsy and subsequent proffer of a flawed cause-of-death\n\nopinion led directly to the plaintiff's arrest, prosecution, and\n\nresulting damages.        See id. at 150.       The court framed the question\n\npresented    by     the   plaintiff's    suit    as     whether,   assuming   that\n\nnegligence and causation were present, the plaintiff's interest in\n\n\n                                        -18-\n\f\"freedom from unjustifiable criminal litigation\" is the \"type of\n\ninterest [that] is protected against unintentional invasion.\"                     Id.\n\nat 151.\n\n              The court then undertook a public policy analysis to\n\ndetermine      whether   imposing     liability      on   the   doctor   would     be\n\nappropriate.       It began by noting that \"[t]he law, for reasons of\n\npolicy, closely circumscribes the types of causes of action which\n\nmay arise against those who participate in law enforcement activity\n\nor in the functioning of the judicial system.\"                    Id. at 152.     It\n\nwent on to observe that, in civil litigation, such defendants often\n\nhave a relationship to the judicial process that affords them\n\nimmunity from private liability.              See id. (citing the protections\n\nafforded to, inter alios, prosecutors and witnesses).                        It next\n\ndetermined that, even when a defendant's relationship to the\n\njudicial process does not afford a specific immunity, \"he is still\n\nnot    held    liable    to   the    person    who    has    been    subjected    to\n\nunjustifiable prosecution in the absence of malice.\"                   Id. at 153.\n\n              The court's reasoning is instructive.               In its view, law\n\nenforcement and the safeguarding of society from crime would suffer\n\nif    government    agents    (and    outsiders      hired   to     assist   in   law\n\nenforcement activities) were subject to private liability for\n\ndamages arising from simple negligence in the performance of their\n\nduties.       See id. at 153-54.      The Bromund court held that:\n\n              even if a person employed by the public to\n              assist in law enforcement . . . does not enjoy\n\n                                       -19-\n\f            immunity, . . . the same considerations of\n            public policy which require proof of malice as\n            an element of an action for malicious\n            prosecution   or   defamation    under   these\n            circumstances must exclude liability founded\n            upon mere negligence.    In our opinion, the\n            interest   in   freedom   from   unjustifiable\n            criminal litigation is, as a matter of policy,\n            not protected from unintentional tort.\n\nId. at 154.\n\n            This   holding   has   particular    pertinence   for   present\n\npurposes.   Assuming arguendo that the appellants could demonstrate\n\nnegligence, causation, and actual harm — a matter on which we take\n\nno view — Wisconsin law nonetheless would preclude the imposition\n\nof private liability on a private person in circumstances similar\n\nto those of Agent Craft.7     Under Bromund, malice is a prerequisite\n\nfor imposing private tort liability upon a private individual\n\nworking with law enforcement when the performance of his duties has\n\nresulted    in     an   unjustifiable      criminal   prosecution    and/or\n\nconviction. See id. at 153-54. Because the appellants have failed\n\nto offer a scintilla of proof of malice, they have failed to\n\nestablish a basis under the law of the place for imposing liability\n\nupon a private person in like circumstances. Consequently, we hold\n\n\n     7\n      A party can, of course, maintain actions for malicious\nprosecution or abuse of process under Wisconsin law.            The\nappellants asserted such claims here. The district court dismissed\nthe malicious prosecution claim for failure to plead the necessary\nelement of malice and the abuse of process claim for failure to\nassert that the withholding of the 302s was willful or done with an\nulterior purpose. Bolduc v. United States, No. 01-CV-11376, 2002\nWL 1760882, at *3-*4 (D. Mass. July 30, 2002). The appellants have\nnot challenged either of those rulings on appeal.\n\n                                    -20-\n\fthat the FTCA does not waive the federal government's sovereign\n\nimmunity vis-à-vis the appellants' negligence claim.                 It follows\n\ninexorably that there is no federal subject matter jurisdiction\n\nover that component of the case.\n\n                  B.     The Negligent Supervision Claim.\n\n              This leaves the negligent supervision claim.              Wisconsin\n\nrecognizes the tort of negligent supervision.             Miller, 580 N.W.2d\n\nat 241.       Under Wisconsin law, a breach of the general duty to\n\nsupervise is actionable if two causation components exist:                first,\n\nthe wrongful act of an employee must have been a cause-in-fact of\n\nthe plaintiff's injury; second, the employer's negligence must have\n\nbeen a cause-in-fact of the employee's wrongful act.                 Id. at 239.\n\nFor these      purposes,    it   is   not   necessary   that   the    employee's\n\nwrongful act, in and of itself, constitute an actionable tort. Id.\n\nHence, our      conclusion    that    the   United   States    cannot    be   held\n\nvicariously liable for Agent Craft's negligence in the handling of\n\nexculpatory evidence, see supra Part III(A), does not negate the\n\npossibility that the United States might be held directly liable\n\nfor negligent supervision.\n\n              We need not hazard a public policy analysis to determine\n\nwhether   a    private    employer    in    like   circumstances     would    face\n\nliability for negligent supervision under Wisconsin law.                 Even if\n\nthe appellants could successfully urge the affirmative of that\n\nproposition — a matter on which we do not opine — the discretionary\n\n\n                                       -21-\n\ffunction exception to the FTCA, 28 U.S.C. § 2680(a), would divest\n\nthe federal courts of jurisdiction over this claim.     We explain\n\nbriefly.\n\n           The FTCA insulates the United States from \"[a]ny claim .\n\n. . based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to\n\nexercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of\n\na federal agency or an employee of the Government, whether or not\n\nthe discretion involved be abused.\"    Id.   This proviso balances\n\n\"Congress' willingness to impose tort liability upon the United\n\nStates and its desire to protect certain governmental activities\n\nfrom exposure to suit by private individuals.\"    United States v.\n\nVarig Airlines, 467 U.S. 797, 808 (1984).      When a claim falls\n\nwithin the contours of section 2680(a), it must be dismissed for\n\nlack of subject matter jurisdiction.   See Kelly v. United States,\n\n924 F.2d 355, 360 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n           To determine whether the discretionary function proviso\n\napplies, an inquiring court must first identify the government\n\nconduct giving rise to the claim in question.      Muniz-Rivera v.\n\nUnited States, 326 F.3d 8, 15 (1st Cir. 2003).    In assaying that\n\nconduct, the court must examine its nature (as opposed to the\n\nstatus of the government actor), Berkovitz v. United States, 486\n\nU.S. 531, 536 (1988), engaging in a binary analysis to ascertain\n\nwhether Congress sought to shelter that kind of conduct from tort\n\nliability, Muniz-Rivera, 326 F.3d at 15.\n\n\n                               -22-\n\f            The first part of that analysis asks whether the conduct\n\nitself is discretionary, that is, \"a matter of choice for the\n\nacting employee.\"     Berkovitz, 486 U.S. at 536.           This definition\n\nexcludes actions prescribed by federal statute, regulation, or\n\npolicy.     Id.   If the court concludes that the conduct is not a\n\nproduct of discretion, the analysis ends and the discretionary\n\nfunction proviso drops out of the case.        See Kelly, 924 F.2d at 360\n\n(noting that a court will proceed to the second furcula of the\n\ndiscretionary function test only if it concludes that the relevant\n\nconduct is discretionary).      If, however, the court concludes that\n\nthe conduct is a product of discretion, it then must determine\n\nwhether the exercise of that discretion is susceptible to policy-\n\nrelated judgments.       See Berkovitz, 486 U.S. at 537.\n\n            Decisions are thought to be susceptible to policy-related\n\njudgments    if   they     involve    an    \"unrestrained    balancing   of\n\nincommensurable values,\" including a differential allocation of\n\nresources among various political objectives.               See Shansky v.\n\nUnited States, 164 F.3d 688, 695 (1st Cir. 1999).            On this issue,\n\nit is the plaintiff who must carry the devoir of persuasion.             See\n\nid. at 692 (explaining that the law presumes that the exercise of\n\ndiscretion implicates policy and that it is the plaintiff's burden\n\nto demonstrate that the decision is not susceptible to policy-\n\nrelated judgments).      Only if the conduct is both discretionary and\n\npolicy-driven will section 2680(a) strip the court of subject\n\n\n                                     -23-\n\fmatter jurisdiction. See Muniz-Rivera, 326 F.3d at 15; Attallah v.\n\nUnited States, 955 F.2d 776, 783 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n             Against this backdrop, the appellants argue that the FBI\n\nhad   an    obligation     under   federal    law    to    disclose   exculpatory\n\nevidence to them and, therefore, that the conduct relevant to their\n\nclaim      was    not   discretionary.        This    argument     confuses    the\n\nministerial duty of FBI agents to place all 302 reports in the case\n\nfile with the responsibility of FBI supervisors to oversee the work\n\nof the agents under their command.            It is the latter activity that\n\ngives rise to the negligent supervision claim.                 On this issue, it\n\nis irrelevant whether Agent Craft had discretion to determine\n\nwhether particular 302 reports should be left out of the case file.\n\nSee Attallah, 955 F.2d at 783 (explaining that the judicial inquiry\n\nmust focus \"on the permissible range of action available to the\n\ngovernment employee allegedly at fault\").\n\n             Having identified the relevant activity — the FBI's\n\noversight of Agent Craft's handling of the 302s — we next must\n\nconsider whether that activity is discretionary and susceptible to\n\npolicy-related judgments. The appellants assign fault at a general\n\nlevel to the quality of the supervision.                  At trial, they adduced\n\nevidence that Agent Craft sometimes initialed 302 reports and other\n\ndocuments        without   reviewing   them   thoroughly      (even   though   his\n\nsupervisors had advised him to be more fastidious in performing\n\nthat task) and that one supervisor had written a performance\n\n\n                                       -24-\n\fappraisal suggesting that Craft had room for improvement in this\n\narea.      The    appellants      have     not    shown,    however,      that    Craft's\n\nsupervisors were constrained by any law, regulation, or policy to\n\nrespond in a particular way upon learning that an agent was not\n\nproficient at a particular task.                 By the same token, they have not\n\nadverted    to    any    federal     statute,       regulation,      or    policy      that\n\ndictates a specific regime of oversight that FBI hierarchs must\n\npractice    to       ensure   that    agents       handle    exculpatory         evidence\n\nproperly.       Where no specific action is required within a category\n\nof conduct and the government actors in question have latitude to\n\nmake decisions and choose among alternative courses of action, the\n\nconduct is discretionary.            See Irving, 162 F.3d at 163-64.              In this\n\ninstance,       there    is   ample       room    for   choice    in      the    agency's\n\nsupervision of its work force.\n\n            If more were needed — and we doubt that it is — this\n\ncourt has recognized, in the context of supervision, that in the\n\nabsence    of    a    statutory      or    regulatory       regime     that     sets    out\n\nparticulars as to how an agency must fulfill its mandate, the\n\ndevelopment and management of a supervisory model is a matter of\n\nagency discretion. Attallah illustrates the point. There, we held\n\nthat supervisory decisions of the Customs Service concerning the\n\noversight of customs agents were discretionary in nature.                               See\n\nAttallah, 955 F.2d at 784-85.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -25-\n\f           The    appellants     argue    that,     notwithstanding       this\n\nprecedent, the supervisory decision here is beyond the domain of\n\ndiscretion.      They assert that even if a claim for negligent\n\nsupervision would generally be barred, the bar should not apply\n\nhere because it is unlawful for a member of the prosecution team to\n\nwithhold exculpatory evidence and it cannot be within an official's\n\ndiscretion to permit unlawful behavior. To bolster this construct,\n\nthey cite Tonelli v. United States, 60 F.3d 492 (8th Cir. 1995),\n\nfor the proposition that \"[f]ailure to act after notice of illegal\n\naction does not represent a choice based on plausible policy\n\nconsiderations.\"    Id. at 496.\n\n           Tonelli is easily distinguishable.             The court there\n\nrecognized that \"[i]ssues of employee supervision . . . generally\n\ninvolve the permissible exercise of policy judgment and fall within\n\nthe discretionary function exception,\" id., but left open the\n\npossibility that an employer who had notice of ongoing illegal\n\nactivity would not be entitled to claim that a failure to act was\n\nwithin the scope of discretion, see id.           It therefore determined\n\nthat summary judgment would be inappropriate because a factual\n\ndispute persisted over whether the employer had notice of the\n\nillegal actions of its employees.          Id.    In this case, unlike in\n\nTonelli, we have the benefit of a full trial record, and we find\n\nnothing   to   support   the   premise    that   FBI   supervisors   in    the\n\nMilwaukee office had notice of any illegal employee activity.               As\n\n\n                                   -26-\n\fa result, we need not decide whether that situation would be\n\nsubject to the conclusions that we otherwise reach.\n\n              That ends this aspect of the matter.                In Attallah, we\n\ncommented that supervision over customs agents \"certainly involves\n\na degree of discretion . . . of the kind that Congress sought to\n\nprotect through the discretionary function exception.\" 955 F.2d at\n\n784. We think that comment is fully applicable here. Accordingly,\n\nwe hold that the FBI's supervision of Craft's job performance was\n\ndiscretionary in nature.\n\n              We    come,    then,    to    the    question      of       whether   this\n\ndiscretionary conduct was grounded in policy.                 On that issue, the\n\ngovernment       benefits    from    the    presumption    that       a    supervisor's\n\ndiscretionary acts are grounded in policy.                 See United States v.\n\nGaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 324 (1991); Muniz-Rivera, 326 F.3d at 17.\n\nIt   is    the     plaintiff's   burden      to   rebut   this    presumption       and\n\ndemonstrate         that    particular       discretionary       conduct       is   not\n\nsusceptible to policy-related judgments.              See Shansky, 164 F.3d at\n\n692.      In this instance, the appellants have wholly failed to carry\n\nthat burden.         We conclude, therefore, that the FBI's supervisory\n\ndecisions were a matter of agency discretion and involved policy\n\njudgments of a kind that the discretionary function proviso was\n\nintended to shield.          See Attallah, 955 F.2d at 784.\n\n              To say more on this point would be to paint the lily.\n\nBased on the foregoing, we hold that the discretionary function\n\n\n                                           -27-\n\fproviso, 28    U.S.C.   §   2680(a),   divests   the   federal   courts   of\n\njurisdiction over the appellants' claim of negligent supervision.8\n\nIV.   CONCLUSION\n\n            This is a sad case.        It shows that even the nation's\n\npremier law enforcement agency sometimes bungles. But Congress has\n\nnever enacted a wholesale waiver of the federal government's\n\nsovereign immunity from suit, so it is unsurprising that the FTCA\n\ndoes not cover every error by a federal agent.         Neither of the two\n\nclaims at issue here — one for negligence and the other for\n\nnegligent supervision — comes within the carapace of the carefully\n\nlimited waiver of federal sovereign immunity that the FTCA denotes.\n\n            We need go no further.      We hold that the district court\n\nlacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear the appellants' claims.\n\nOn this ground, we affirm the entry of judgment in favor of the\n\nUnited States.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n      8\n      For consistency's sake, we affirm the entry of judgment in\nfavor of the United States with respect to this claim on an\navailable jurisdictional ground. We note, however, that we have\nscoured the record and have found no support for the contention\nthat any negligence on the part of FBI supervisors was a cause-in-\nfact of Agent Craft's failure to place the 302s in the case file.\n\n                                  -28-\n\f",

After the truth came to light, the trial court set aside the convictions. The men then sued the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1346(b), 2671-2680. Following a bench trial, the district court denied relief. <i>See Bolduc v. United States,</i> 265 F.Supp.2d 153 (D.Mass.2003). The court acknowledged the government's jurisdictional challenges but opted to decide the case on the merits. <i>See id.</i> at 154.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, we think it more orderly to treat the question of jurisdiction as a threshold matter. Concluding, as we do, that the FTCA does not support the assertion of federal subject matter jurisdiction, we affirm the judgment on that alternative ground.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The chronicle of relevant events takes us back more than sixteen years. We recount the facts as supportably found by the district court. <i>See id.</i> at 155-69.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 28, 1988, two middle-aged white men attempted to rob a branch of the First Wisconsin Bank situated at the Southgate Mall in Greenfield, Wisconsin. The FBI mounted an investigation into the Southgate incident. Agent Daniel Craft led the probe. Because the thieves came away from Southgate empty-handed, Craft considered the crime a \"nothing robbery\" and delegated substantial investigative responsibility to a rookie, Agent Derrel Craig.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 15, 1988, Craft and Craig rounded up four Southgate eyewitnesses and showed them a photographic array. The array did not include pictures of either the appellants or the men who ultimately were determined to be the actual culprits. Nevertheless, two of the four eyewitnesses selected the photographs of Allan Daniel Wilwerding and Douglas Wayne Thompson as depictions of the robbers, and another eyewitness fingered Wilwerding. The agents recorded the results in separate memos, known in FBI parlance as 302 reports. The two sets of reports attributed different levels of certitude to the eyewitness identifications: Craft's reports indicated that two of the eyewitnesses had described Wilwerding and Thompson as \"similar\" to the robbers whereas Craig's reports noted that those eyewitnesses had identified the men as \"identical\" to the robbers. The reports regarding the eyewitness who had identified only Wilwerding were also inconsistent; again, Craft's report attributed a \"similar\" identification to that eyewitness whereas Craig's report recorded an \"identical\" match.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As lead investigator, Craft bore responsibility for finalizing the 302 reports by reviewing them for errors and initialing them. According to FBI policy, once Craft finalized the 302 reports, he was required to place them in the case file. The court below found that, in this instance, Craft ignored this policy and excluded Craig's 302 reports from the case file because he unilaterally decided that they inaccurately reported the strength of the identifications. <i>Id.</i> at 157. The court also found it doubtful that Craft's 302 reports were in the case file when the FBI turned it over to the United States Attorney. <i>Id.</i> It is undisputed that FBI agents have no discretion to withhold particular 302 reports from a case file. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 18, 1989, two middle-aged white men stuck up the Oklahoma Avenue branch of the First Wisconsin Bank in Milwaukee and absconded with $400,000. Agent Craft again took the lead in the ensuing investigation. This time, however, his aide-de-camp was Agent Margaret Cronin. The general description of the Oklahoma Avenue perpetrators reminded Cronin, a Boston native, of an article she had read in a Boston newspaper describing arrests in Lowell, Massachusetts, following an armored car robbery in nearby Chelmsford. Those arrested included two middle-aged white men, and Cronin thought that she perceived some similarities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 1990, on Cronin's initiative, the Milwaukee office of the FBI included photographs of plaintiffs-appellants Frank Bolduc and Francis Larkin (each of whom had been detained in connection with the Chelmsford armored car robbery) in an array displayed to the Southgate and Oklahoma Avenue eyewitnesses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Some witnesses identified Bolduc and/or Larkin as the culprits; others were unable to make any positive identifications at that time. Encouraged to some extent by these results, the FBI arranged to have the appellants transported to Wisconsin and placed them in a lineup. Several (but not all) of the eyewitnesses to the Southgate and Oklahoma Avenue incidents identified them as the robbers. A federal grand jury, sitting in Milwaukee, subsequently indicted the appellants for the attempted armed robbery of Southgate and the armed robbery of Oklahoma Avenue, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2113, and for related firearms offenses, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 924(c)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial went forward in February of 1991. The prosecution relied entirely upon eyewitness identifications, including the testimony of the same three witnesses who previously had identified others (Wilwerding and Thompson) as \"similar\" or \"identical\" to the Southgate bandits; this time, the trio made positive identifications of Bolduc and/or Larkin. Neither the prosecutor nor the witnesses themselves mentioned their earlier (inconsistent) match-ups. The defense relied mainly upon alibi testimony indicating that the appellants were in the Boston area when the crimes were committed. The jury found the appellants guilty of all charges and, on May 24, 1991, the district court sentenced both men to serve lengthy prison terms.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the imposition of sentence, federal officials returned Bolduc to a Massachusetts state penitentiary to resume serving a life sentence for an earlier second-degree murder conviction, which the parole board had reinstated upon Bolduc's arrest for his putative involvement in the Chelmsford armored car robbery. Upon learning of the federal convictions, however, Massachusetts authorities decided to dismiss the charges pending against Bolduc and Larkin with respect to the armored car caper. In their view, the appellants' ages and the length of their federal sentences contradicted the need to seek additional prison time. Despite this decision, the Massachusetts parole board determined that Bolduc's federal conviction furnished sufficient grounds to support the revocation of his parole and, therefore, he remained in state prison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding the appellants' arrests and incarceration, similar robberies continued to plague Midwestern banks. More than six years after the appellants were sentenced, the FBI arrested William Kirkpatrick on suspicion of involvement in several of the more recent robberies. Though incarcerated, Bolduc caught wind of this turn of events and asked Kirkpatrick's attorney for any available information about the Southgate and Oklahoma Avenue robberies. The lawyer sent Bolduc a packet containing, inter alia, Agent Craig's 302 reports anent the November 1988 photo array. It was in that roundabout way that Bolduc first learned of this exculpatory evidence. Larkin learned of the evidence at an even later date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In time, Kirkpatrick confessed that he and a partner had undertaken both the Southgate and Oklahoma Avenue heists. The appellants filed federal habeas petitions, <i>see</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255, which the government did not oppose. On June 11, 1999, a federal district judge granted the petitions, vacated the appellants' sentences, and issued certificates of innocence. Larkin was released from federal custody and Bolduc, relying on the certificate of innocence, successfully petitioned the Massachusetts parole board for reinstatement of his parole.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. TRAVEL OF THE CASE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following their release, the appellants commenced a civil action in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts in an effort to recover money damages for the eight years that they had languished in prison. Their complaint presented claims under the FTCA against the United States for malicious prosecution, false imprisonment, abuse of process, and negligent supervision, as well as a <i>Bivens</i> claim against Agent Craft, <i>see Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of FBN,</i> 403 U.S. 388, 389, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). The district court dismissed the malicious prosecution, abuse of process, and false imprisonment counts for failure to state claims upon which relief could be granted, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), and dismissed the <i>Bivens</i> claim for want of in personam jurisdiction, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(2). None of these rulings have been contested on appeal and we abjure any further discussion of them.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Withal, the district court permitted the negligent supervision claim to go forward and subsequently allowed the appellants to add a straight negligence claim under the FTCA. Both claims were premised on the allegation that the FBI's withholding of the above-described 302 reports deprived the appellants of the benefit of exculpatory evidence before and during the criminal trial, and thus led to their wrongful convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties engaged in extensive discovery. The government challenged the existence of subject matter jurisdiction for the first time in a motion served almost two months after the deadline for filing dispositive motions had passed. Subject matter jurisdiction is not waivable, and a party cannot confer subject matter jurisdiction upon a federal court by failing to assert that defense in a timely manner. <i>See Quinn v. City of Boston,</i> 325 F.3d 18, 26 (1st Cir.2003); <i>Irving v. United States,</i> 162 F.3d 154, 160 (1st Cir.1998) (en banc). Still, the belated filing of a motion to dismiss for want of subject matter jurisdiction can have consequences in terms of a court's case-management decisions. So it was here: the district court elected to withhold consideration of the jurisdictional issue until after the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants' two remaining claims &#8212; negligence and negligent supervision under the FTCA &#8212; were tried to the district court for four days. The court then requested post-trial briefing. The government's memorandum raised a litany of defenses, including a renewed plea that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 2, 2003, the district court filed a lengthy rescript in which it ordered judgment in favor of the United States on the ground that the appellants had not proved that the FBI's failure to provide the exculpatory 302 reports had harmed them. <i>See Bolduc,</i> 265 F.Supp.2d at 154, 171. The court's rationale is complicated, <i>see id.</i> at 154, 169-71, and the appellants bitterly dispute it. We need not set foot on that battlefield: federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction and, in the circumstances of this case, we consider ourselves bound to address the jurisdictional issue first, regardless of the government's failure to raise it in a more timely fashion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See Irving,</i> 162 F.3d at 160 (admonishing that the federal courts \"have an affirmative obligation to examine jurisdictional concerns on their own initiative\" even if the parties have neglected them); <i>Berner v. Delahanty,</i> 129 F.3d 20, 23 (1st Cir.1997) (noting \"that a court should first confirm the existence of rudiments such as jurisdiction ... before tackling the merits of a controverted case\"). As matters turn out, resolution of that issue terminates this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consistent with the foregoing, we turn directly to the jurisdictional issue. We begin with first principles: it is apodictic that \"[a]s a sovereign nation, the United States is immune from liability except to the extent that it consents to suit.\" <i>Dynamic Image Techs., Inc. v. United States,</i> 221 F.3d 34, 39 (1st Cir.2000). The FTCA evinces a waiver of sovereign immunity with respect to certain categories of torts committed by federal employees in the scope of their employment. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1346(b)(1). It simultaneously grants the federal district courts jurisdiction over such claims. <i>See id.; see also FDIC v. Meyer,</i> 510 U.S. 471, 475-77, 114 S.Ct. 996, 127 L.Ed.2d 308 (1994). Thus, we must determine whether this waiver of sovereign immunity extends to the appellants' claims of negligence and negligent supervision, so that those claims fall within the jurisdictional grant of section 1346(b)(1). <i>See Meyer,</i> 510 U.S. at 477, 114 S.Ct. 996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">That grant extends to claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">against the United States, for money damages, accruing on and after January 1, 1945, for injury or loss of property, or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment, under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">28 U.S.C. &#167; 1346(b)(1). A further explication of the last clause is to be found in 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2674, which provides that the United States only \"shall be liable ... in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.\" A bundle of exceptions, mostly in the nature of exclusions and carve-outs, circumscribes the FTCA's waiver of sovereign immunity. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2680(a)-(n); <i>see also Dynamic Image Techs.,</i> 221 F.3d at 39.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add a caveat. As with all waivers of sovereign immunity, the FTCA must be \"construed strictly in favor of the federal government, and must not be enlarged beyond such boundaries as its language plainly requires.\" <i>United States v. Horn,</i> 29 F.3d 754, 762 (1st Cir.1994). With this principle firmly in mind, we undertake our jurisdictional analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As said, the appellants prosecuted two FTCA claims: one for negligence (based on Agent Craft's alleged failure to include the above-described 302s in the case file turned over to federal prosecutors and ultimately to the defense) and one for negligent supervision (based on the alleged failure of Craft's superiors to oversee him more closely). We consider the jurisdictional bona fides of each claim separately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>The Negligence Claim.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"law of the place\" provides the substantive rules to be used in deciding FTCA actions. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1346(b)(1). The phrase \"law of the place\" refers to the law of the state in which the allegedly tortious acts or omissions occurred. <i>See Meyer,</i> 510 U.S. at 478, 114 S.Ct. 996; <i>Castro v. United States,</i> 775 F.2d 399, 405 (1st Cir.1985) (per curiam). Federal constitutional or statutory law cannot function as the source of FTCA liability. <i>See Meyer,</i> 510 U.S. at 478, 114 S.Ct. 996 (holding that \"the United States simply has not rendered itself liable under &#167; 1346(b) for constitutional tort claims\"); <i>Sea Air Shuttle Corp. v. United States,</i> 112 F.3d 532, 536-37 (1st Cir.1997) (explaining that there can be no FTCA jurisdiction where the challenged government conduct has no parallel in the private sector and the asserted liability arises from a federal statutory or regulatory obligation with no comparable common law principle under which private persons would be held liable); <i>Zabala Clemente v. United States,</i> 567 F.2d 1140, 1149 (1st Cir.1978) (establishing that \"even where specific behavior of federal employees is required by federal statute, liability to the beneficiaries of that statute may not be founded on the Federal Tort Claims Act if state law recognizes no comparable private liability\"). It follows that the appellants cannot premise jurisdiction on the rule of <i>Brady v. Maryland,</i> 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> but, rather, must look to Wisconsin law and must identify in that body of jurisprudence a basis for holding a private person liable in tort for acts and omissions comparable to those committed (or, at least, allegedly committed) by Agent Craft. <i>See Davric Me. Corp. v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</i> 238 F.3d 58, 64 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To maintain a cause of action for negligence in Wisconsin, a plaintiff must show \"(1) [a] duty of care on the part of the defendant; (2) a breach of that duty; (3) a causal connection between the conduct and the injury; and (4) an actual loss or damage as a result of the injury.\" <i>Rockweit v. Senecal,</i> 197 Wis.2d 409, 541 N.W.2d 742, 747 (1995). Building on this fairly conventional formulation, the appellants argue that Agent Craft's failure to ensure the turnover of exculpatory evidence constituted a breach of a duty cognizable under Wisconsin tort law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To satisfy the duty prong, the appellants rely in part on the duty of state government (and, particularly, state prosecutors) to disclose exculpatory evidence. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Appellants' Reply Br. at 5-6 (citing Wis. Stat. &#167; 971.23(1)). This effort is unconvincing. By the FTCA's plain terms, a waiver of sovereign immunity attaches only where \"a <i>private person</i> [] would be held liable.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1346(b)(1) (emphasis supplied). The appellants have not pointed to any instance in which Wisconsin has imposed <i>private</i> liability on a prosecutor or other state agent for a failure to disclose exculpatory evidence. That is a fatal flaw, for the federal government does not yield its immunity with respect to obligations that are peculiar to governments or official-capacity state actors and which have no private counterpart in state law. <i>See Franco de Jerez v. Burgos,</i> 947 F.2d 527, 528 (1st Cir.1991) (speaking in terms of the negligence of government employees <i>as such</i> is insufficient to satisfy the FTCA's \"private person\" requirement); <i>DiMella v. Gray Lines of Boston, Inc.,</i> 836 F.2d 718, 720 (1st Cir.1988) (stating that \"[w]hatever liability [a state] may have chosen to assume for itself as a matter of governmental policy has no bearing on the liability of ... private persons, the standard the federal government has accepted\"). Because Wisconsin's recognition of a governmental duty to disclose exculpatory evidence does not ground private liability under that state's law, it cannot serve as a hook on which to hang federal jurisdiction here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion does not end our inquiry. We nonetheless must inquire whether there is any way in which Wisconsin might impose tort liability upon a private party under circumstances sufficiently similar to those present in this case, that is, a person who comes into possession of exculpatory evidence as part of an official investigation and carelessly fails to disclose that evidence to prosecutors (and, ultimately, to the accused). This means, in effect, that we must look for \"some relationship between the governmental employee[s] and plaintiff to which state law would attach a duty of care in purely private circumstances.\" <i>Sea Air Shuttle,</i> 112 F.3d at 537 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In formulating its test for negligence, Wisconsin has adopted a broad definition of the element of duty. <i>See A.E. Inv. Corp. v. Link Builders, Inc.,</i> 62 Wis.2d 479, 214 N.W.2d 764, 766 (1974) (explaining that Wisconsin has embraced a rationale that recognizes a duty wherever harm is foreseeable). As a result of this choice, Wisconsin courts, rather than examining the relationship between the parties to determine the existence vel non of a duty, focus on the foreseeability of harm in order to ascertain whether a duty arises. This means that \"[t]he duty of any person is the obligation of due care to refrain from any act which will cause foreseeable harm to others even though the nature of that harm and the identity of the harmed person or harmed interest is unknown at the time of the act.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This formulation casts a wide net. Indeed, the Wisconsin Supreme Court &#8212; the most authoritative arbiter of Wisconsin law &#8212; has ruminated that \"[i]n Wisconsin, everyone has a duty of care to the whole world.\" <i>Miller v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,</i> 219 Wis.2d 250, 580 N.W.2d 233, 238 (1998). In these general terms, then, a private person might be said to owe a duty to a person suspected of crime-the duty being to exercise due care in the handling of exculpatory evidence so as to prevent the foreseeable harm of wrongful conviction. <i>Cf. Bowen v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co.,</i> 183 Wis.2d 627, 517 N.W.2d 432, 439 (1994) (\"Wisconsin law considers conduct to be negligent if it involves a foreseeable risk of harm to anyone.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we assume the existence of such a duty, that assumption does not take the appellants as far as they need to go. Under the FTCA, the relevant inquiry is not whether state law might assign a duty to a private person in the same or similar circumstances, but, rather, whether state law would impose liability on a private person in the same or similar circumstances. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1346(b)(1), 2674. The stating of a claim for negligence (the failure to exercise due care by one having a general duty to do so in the face of foreseeable harm) does not automatically mean that liability would attach under Wisconsin law. The contrary is true: \"[i]n Wisconsin, the doctrine of public policy, not the doctrine of duty, limits the scope of a defendant's liability.\" <i>Bowen,</i> 517 N.W.2d at 439; <i>see also Rockweit,</i> 541 N.W.2d at 750 (stating that \"the determination to deny liability is essentially one of public policy rather than of duty or causation\"); <i>Schuster v. Altenberg,</i> 144 Wis.2d 223, 424 N.W.2d 159, 164 (1988) (\"[O]nce it is determined that a negligent act has been committed and that the act is a substantial factor in causing the harm, the question of duty is irrelevant and a finding of nonliability can be made only in terms of public policy.\"). Because the measure for determining the federal government's consent to suit under the FTCA is a private person's potential <i>liability</i> under state law, we turn to Wisconsin's doctrine of public policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question of whether public policy precludes tort liability is \"a question of law solely for judicial decision.\" <i>Morgan v. Pa. Gen. Ins. Co.,</i> 87 Wis.2d 723, 275 N.W.2d 660, 667 (1979). The Wisconsin Supreme Court has enumerated six factors relevant to this determination. <i>See Miller,</i> 580 N.W.2d at 240. We need not call the roll, however, as that court has decided a case directly on point dealing with a private person in markedly similar circumstances. We look to that decision for guidance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Bromund v. Holt,</i> 24 Wis.2d 336, 129 N.W.2d 149 (1964), the plaintiff brought an action in negligence against a doctor, in his private capacity, for careless performance of an autopsy commissioned by law enforcement officers in the course of their investigation into the death of the plaintiff's wife. <i>Id.</i> at 150-51. The plaintiff asserted that the doctor's negligent performance of the autopsy and subsequent proffer of a flawed cause-of-death opinion led directly to the plaintiff's arrest, prosecution, and resulting damages. <i>See id.</i> at 150. The court framed the question presented by the plaintiff's suit as whether, assuming that negligence and causation were present, the plaintiff's interest in \"freedom from unjustifiable criminal litigation\" is the \"type of interest [that] is protected against unintentional invasion.\" <i>Id.</i> at 151.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then undertook a public policy analysis to determine whether imposing liability on the doctor would be appropriate. It began by noting that \"[t]he law, for reasons of policy, closely circumscribes the types of causes of action which may arise against those who participate in law enforcement activity or in the functioning of the judicial system.\" <i>Id.</i> at 152. It went on to observe that, in civil litigation, such defendants often have a relationship to the judicial process that affords them immunity from private liability. <i>See id.</i> (citing the protections afforded to, inter alios, prosecutors and witnesses). It next determined that, even when a defendant's relationship to the judicial process does not afford a specific immunity, \"he is still not held liable to the person who has been subjected to unjustifiable prosecution in the absence of malice.\" <i>Id.</i> at 153.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's reasoning is instructive. In its view, law enforcement and the safeguarding of society from crime would suffer if government agents (and outsiders hired to assist in law enforcement activities) were subject to private liability for damages arising from simple negligence in the performance of their duties. <i>See id.</i> at 153-54. The <i>Bromund</i> court held that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">even if a person employed by the public to assist in law enforcement... does not enjoy immunity, ... the same considerations of public policy which require proof of malice as an element of an action for malicious prosecution or defamation under these circumstances must exclude liability founded upon mere negligence. In our opinion, the interest in freedom from unjustifiable criminal litigation is, as a matter of policy, not protected from unintentional tort.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 154.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This holding has particular pertinence for present purposes. Assuming arguendo that the appellants could demonstrate negligence, causation, and actual harm &#8212; a matter on which we take no view &#8212; Wisconsin law nonetheless would preclude the imposition of private liability on a private person in circumstances similar to those of Agent Craft.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Under <i>Bromund,</i> malice is a prerequisite for imposing private tort liability upon a private individual working with law enforcement when the performance of his duties has resulted in an unjustifiable criminal prosecution and/or conviction. <i>See id.</i> at 153-54. Because the appellants have failed to offer a scintilla of proof of malice, they have failed to establish a basis under the law of the place for imposing liability upon a private person in like circumstances. Consequently, we hold that the FTCA does not waive the federal government's sovereign immunity vis-a-vis the appellants' negligence claim. It follows inexorably that there is no federal subject matter jurisdiction over that component of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The Negligent Supervision Claim.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves the negligent supervision claim. Wisconsin recognizes the tort of negligent supervision. <i>Miller,</i> 580 N.W.2d at 241. Under Wisconsin law, a breach of the general duty to supervise is actionable if two causation components exist: first, the wrongful act of an employee must have been a cause-in-fact of the plaintiff's injury; second, the employer's negligence must have been a cause-in-fact of the employee's wrongful act. <i>Id.</i> at 239. For these purposes, it is not necessary that the employee's wrongful act, in and of itself, constitute an actionable tort. <i>Id.</i> Hence, our conclusion that the United States cannot be held vicariously liable for Agent Craft's negligence in the handling of exculpatory evidence, <i>see supra</i> Part III(A), does not negate the possibility that the United States might be held directly liable for negligent supervision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not hazard a public policy analysis to determine whether a private employer in like circumstances would face liability for negligent supervision under Wisconsin law. Even if the appellants could successfully urge the affirmative of that proposition &#8212; a matter on which we do not opine &#8212; the discretionary function exception to the FTCA, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2680(a), would divest the federal courts of jurisdiction over this claim. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FTCA insulates the United States from \"[a]ny claim ... based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the Government, whether or not the discretion involved be abused.\" <i>Id.</i> This proviso balances \"Congress' willingness to impose tort liability upon the United States and its desire to protect certain governmental activities from exposure to suit by private individuals.\" <i>United States v. Varig Airlines,</i> 467 U.S. 797, 808, 104 S.Ct. 2755, 81 L.Ed.2d 660 (1984). When a claim falls within the contours of section 2680(a), it must be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <i>See Kelly v. United States,</i> 924 F.2d 355, 360 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To determine whether the discretionary function proviso applies, an inquiring court must first identify the government conduct giving rise to the claim in question. <i>Muniz-Rivera v. United States,</i> 326 F.3d 8, 15 (1st Cir.2003). In assaying that conduct, the court must examine its nature (as opposed to the status of the government actor), <i>Berkovitz v. United States,</i> 486 U.S. 531, 536, 108 S.Ct. 1954, 100 L.Ed.2d 531 (1988), engaging in a binary analysis to ascertain whether Congress sought to shelter that kind of conduct from tort liability, <i>Muniz-Rivera,</i> 326 F.3d at 15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first part of that analysis asks whether the conduct itself is discretionary, that is, \"a matter of choice for the acting employee.\" <i>Berkovitz,</i> 486 U.S. at 536, 108 S.Ct. 1954. This definition excludes actions prescribed by federal statute, regulation, or policy. <i>Id.</i> If the court concludes that the conduct is not a product of discretion, the analysis ends and the discretionary function proviso drops out of the case. <i>See Kelly,</i> 924 F.2d at 360 (noting that a court will proceed to the second furcula of the discretionary function test only if it concludes that the relevant conduct is discretionary). If, however, the court concludes that the conduct is a product of discretion, it then must determine whether the exercise of that discretion is susceptible to policy-related judgments. <i>See Berkovitz,</i> 486 U.S. at 537, 108 S.Ct. 1954.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Decisions are thought to be susceptible to policy-related judgments if they involve an \"unrestrained balancing of incommensurable values,\" including a differential allocation of resources among various political objectives. <i>See Shansky v. United States,</i> 164 F.3d 688, 695 (1st Cir.1999). On this issue, it is the plaintiff who must carry the devoir of persuasion. <i>See id.</i> at 692 (explaining that the law presumes that the exercise of discretion implicates policy and that it is the plaintiff's burden to demonstrate that the decision is not susceptible to policy-related judgments). Only if the conduct is both discretionary and policy-driven will section 2680(a) strip the court of subject matter jurisdiction. <i>See Muniz-Rivera,</i> 326 F.3d at 15; <i>Attallah v. United States,</i> 955 F.2d 776, 783 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, the appellants argue that the FBI had an obligation under federal law to disclose exculpatory evidence to them and, therefore, that the conduct relevant to their claim was not discretionary. This argument confuses the ministerial duty of FBI agents to place all 302 reports in the case file with the responsibility of FBI supervisors to oversee the work of the agents under their command. It is the latter activity that gives rise to the negligent supervision claim. On this issue, it is irrelevant whether Agent Craft had discretion to determine whether particular 302 reports should be left out of the case file. <i>See Attallah,</i> 955 F.2d at 783 (explaining that the judicial inquiry must focus \"on the permissible range of action available to the government employee allegedly at fault\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having identified the relevant activity &#8212; the FBI's oversight of Agent Craft's handling of the 302s &#8212; we next must consider whether that activity is discretionary and susceptible to policy-related judgments. The appellants assign fault at a general level to the quality of the supervision. At trial, they adduced evidence that Agent Craft sometimes initialed 302 reports and other documents without reviewing them thoroughly (even though his supervisors had advised him to be more fastidious in performing that task) and that one supervisor had written a performance appraisal suggesting that Craft had room for improvement in this area. The appellants have not shown, however, that Craft's supervisors were constrained by any law, regulation, or policy to respond in a particular way upon learning that an agent was not proficient at a particular task. By the same token, they have not adverted to any federal statute, regulation, or policy that dictates a specific regime of oversight that FBI hierarchs must practice to ensure that agents handle exculpatory evidence properly. Where no specific action is required within a category of conduct and the government actors in question have latitude to make decisions and choose among alternative courses of action, the conduct is discretionary. <i>See Irving,</i> 162 F.3d at 163-64. In this instance, there is ample room for choice in the agency's supervision of its work force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If more were needed &#8212; and we doubt that it is &#8212; this court has recognized, in the context of supervision, that in the absence of a statutory or regulatory regime that sets out particulars as to how an agency must fulfill its mandate, the development and management of a supervisory model is a matter of agency discretion. <i>Attallah</i> illustrates the point. There, we held that supervisory decisions of the Customs Service concerning the oversight of customs agents were discretionary in nature. <i>See Attallah,</i> 955 F.2d at 784-85.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants argue that, notwithstanding this precedent, the supervisory decision here is beyond the domain of discretion. They assert that even if a claim for negligent supervision would generally be barred, the bar should not apply here because it is unlawful for a member of the prosecution team to withhold exculpatory evidence and it cannot be within an official's discretion to permit unlawful behavior. To bolster this construct, they cite <i>Tonelli v. United States,</i> 60 F.3d 492 (8th Cir.1995), for the proposition that \"[f]ailure to act after notice of illegal action does not represent a choice based on plausible policy considerations.\" <i>Id.</i> at 496.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Tonelli</i> is easily distinguishable. The court there recognized that \"[i]ssues of employee supervision ... generally involve the permissible exercise of policy judgment and fall within the discretionary function exception,\" <i>id.,</i> but left open the possibility that an employer who had notice of ongoing illegal activity would not be entitled to claim that a failure to act was within the scope of discretion, <i>see id.</i> It therefore determined that summary judgment would be inappropriate because a factual dispute persisted over whether the employer had notice of the illegal actions of its employees. <i>Id.</i> In this case, unlike in <i>Tonelli,</i> we have the benefit of a full trial record, and we find nothing to support the premise that FBI supervisors in the Milwaukee office had notice of any illegal employee activity. As a result, we need not decide whether that situation would be subject to the conclusions that we otherwise reach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this aspect of the matter. In <i>Attallah,</i> we commented that supervision over customs agents \"certainly involves a degree of discretion ... of the kind that Congress sought to protect through the discretionary function exception.\" 955 F.2d at 784. We think that comment is fully applicable here. Accordingly, we hold that the FBI's supervision of Craft's job performance was discretionary in nature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We come, then, to the question of whether this discretionary conduct was grounded in policy. On that issue, the government benefits from the presumption that a supervisor's discretionary acts are grounded in policy. <i>See United States v. Gaubert,</i> 499 U.S. 315, 324, 111 S.Ct. 1267, 113 L.Ed.2d 335 (1991); <i>Muniz-Rivera,</i> 326 F.3d at 17. It is the plaintiff's burden to rebut this presumption and demonstrate that particular discretionary conduct is not susceptible to policy-related judgments. <i>See Shansky,</i> 164 F.3d at 692. In this instance, the appellants have wholly failed to carry that burden. We conclude, therefore, that the FBI's supervisory decisions were a matter of agency discretion and involved policy judgments of a kind that the discretionary function proviso was intended to shield. <i>See Attallah,</i> 955 F.2d at 784.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more on this point would be to paint the lily. Based on the foregoing, we hold that the discretionary function proviso, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2680(a), divests the federal courts of jurisdiction over the appellants' claim of negligent supervision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is a sad case. It shows that even the nation's premier law enforcement agency sometimes bungles. But Congress has never enacted a wholesale waiver of the federal government's sovereign immunity from suit, so it is unsurprising that the FTCA does not cover every error by a federal agent. Neither of the two claims at issue here &#8212; one for negligence and the other for negligent supervision &#8212; comes within the carapace of the carefully limited waiver of federal sovereign immunity that the FTCA denotes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.

That is a narrow exception, however, especially in view of a federal court's \"special obligation to `satisfy itself not only of its own jurisdiction, but also that of the lower courts in a cause under review.'\" <i>Bender v.

After the truth came to light, the trial court set aside the convictions. The men then sued the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1346(b), 2671-2680. Following a bench trial, the district court denied relief. <i>See Bolduc v.

Concluding, as we do, that the FTCA does not support the assertion of federal subject matter jurisdiction, we affirm the judgment on that alternative ground.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The chronicle of relevant events takes us back more than sixteen years. We recount the facts as supportably found by the district court. <i>See id.</i> at 155-69.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 28, 1988, two middle-aged white men attempted to rob a branch of the First Wisconsin Bank situated at the Southgate Mall in Greenfield, Wisconsin. The FBI mounted an investigation into the Southgate incident. Agent Daniel Craft led the probe. Because the thieves came away from Southgate empty-handed, Craft considered the crime a \"nothing robbery\" and delegated substantial investigative responsibility to a rookie, Agent Derrel Craig.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 15, 1988, Craft and Craig rounded up four Southgate eyewitnesses and showed them a photographic array. The array did not include pictures of either the appellants or the men who ultimately were determined to be the actual culprits. Nevertheless, two of the four eyewitnesses selected the photographs of Allan Daniel Wilwerding and Douglas Wayne Thompson as depictions of the robbers, and another eyewitness fingered Wilwerding. The agents recorded the results in separate memos, known in FBI parlance as 302 reports. The two sets of reports attributed different levels of certitude to the eyewitness identifications: Craft's reports indicated that two of the eyewitnesses had described Wilwerding and Thompson as \"similar\" to the robbers whereas Craig's reports noted that those eyewitnesses had identified the men as \"identical\" to the robbers. The reports regarding the eyewitness who had identified only Wilwerding were also inconsistent; again, Craft's report attributed a \"similar\" identification to that eyewitness whereas Craig's report recorded an \"identical\" match.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As lead investigator, Craft bore responsibility for finalizing the 302 reports by reviewing them for errors and initialing them. According to FBI policy, once Craft finalized the 302 reports, he was required to place them in the case file. The court below found that, in this instance, Craft ignored this policy and excluded Craig's 302 reports from the case file because he unilaterally decided that they inaccurately reported the strength of the identifications. <i>Id.</i> at 157. The court also found it doubtful that Craft's 302 reports were in the case file when the FBI turned it over to the United States Attorney. <i>Id.</i> It is undisputed that FBI agents have no discretion to withhold particular 302 reports from a case file. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 18, 1989, two middle-aged white men stuck up the Oklahoma Avenue branch of the First Wisconsin Bank in Milwaukee and absconded with $400,000. Agent Craft again took the lead in the ensuing investigation. This time, however, his aide-de-camp was Agent Margaret Cronin. The general description of the Oklahoma Avenue perpetrators reminded Cronin, a Boston native, of an article she had read in a Boston newspaper describing arrests in Lowell, Massachusetts, following an armored car robbery in nearby Chelmsford. Those arrested included two middle-aged white men, and Cronin thought that she perceived some similarities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 1990, on Cronin's initiative, the Milwaukee office of the FBI included photographs of plaintiffs-appellants Frank Bolduc and Francis Larkin (each of whom had been detained in connection with the Chelmsford armored car robbery) in an array displayed to the Southgate and Oklahoma Avenue eyewitnesses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Some witnesses identified Bolduc and/or Larkin as the culprits; others were unable to make any positive identifications at that time. Encouraged to some extent by these results, the FBI arranged to have the appellants transported to Wisconsin and placed them in a lineup. Several (but not all) of the eyewitnesses to the Southgate and Oklahoma Avenue incidents identified them as the robbers. A federal grand jury, sitting in Milwaukee, subsequently indicted the appellants for the attempted armed robbery of Southgate and the armed robbery of Oklahoma Avenue, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2113, and for related firearms offenses, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 924(c)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial went forward in February of 1991. The prosecution relied entirely upon eyewitness identifications, including the testimony of the same three witnesses who previously had identified others (Wilwerding and Thompson) as \"similar\" or \"identical\" to the Southgate bandits; this time, the trio made positive identifications of Bolduc and/or Larkin. Neither the prosecutor nor the witnesses themselves mentioned their earlier (inconsistent) match-ups. The defense relied mainly upon alibi testimony indicating that the appellants were in the Boston area when the crimes were committed. The jury found the appellants guilty of all charges and, on May 24, 1991, the district court sentenced both men to serve lengthy prison terms.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the imposition of sentence, federal officials returned Bolduc to a Massachusetts state penitentiary to resume serving a life sentence for an earlier second-degree murder conviction, which the parole board had reinstated upon Bolduc's arrest for his putative involvement in the Chelmsford armored car robbery. Upon learning of the federal convictions, however, Massachusetts authorities decided to dismiss the charges pending against Bolduc and Larkin with respect to the armored car caper. In their view, the appellants' ages and the length of their federal sentences contradicted the need to seek additional prison time. Despite this decision, the Massachusetts parole board determined that Bolduc's federal conviction furnished sufficient grounds to support the revocation of his parole and, therefore, he remained in state prison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding the appellants' arrests and incarceration, similar robberies continued to plague Midwestern banks. More than six years after the appellants were sentenced, the FBI arrested William Kirkpatrick on suspicion of involvement in several of the more recent robberies. Though incarcerated, Bolduc caught wind of this turn of events and asked Kirkpatrick's attorney for any available information about the Southgate and Oklahoma Avenue robberies. The lawyer sent Bolduc a packet containing, inter alia, Agent Craig's 302 reports anent the November 1988 photo array. It was in that roundabout way that Bolduc first learned of this exculpatory evidence. Larkin learned of the evidence at an even later date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In time, Kirkpatrick confessed that he and a partner had undertaken both the Southgate and Oklahoma Avenue heists. The appellants filed federal habeas petitions, <i>see</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255, which the government did not oppose. On June 11, 1999, a federal district judge granted the petitions, vacated the appellants' sentences, and issued certificates of innocence. Larkin was released from federal custody and Bolduc, relying on the certificate of innocence, successfully petitioned the Massachusetts parole board for reinstatement of his parole.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. TRAVEL OF THE CASE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following their release, the appellants commenced a civil action in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts in an effort to recover money damages for the eight years that they had languished in prison. Their complaint presented claims under the FTCA against the United States for malicious prosecution, false imprisonment, abuse of process, and negligent supervision, as well as a <i>Bivens</i> claim against Agent Craft, <i>see Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of FBN,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108375\"><a href=\"/opinion/108375/bivens-v-six-unknown-fed-narcotics-agents/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">388</span></a></span>, 389, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108375\"><a href=\"/opinion/108375/bivens-v-six-unknown-fed-narcotics-agents/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></a></span> (1971). The district court dismissed the malicious prosecution, abuse of process, and false imprisonment counts for failure to state claims upon which relief could be granted, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), and dismissed the <i>Bivens</i> claim for want of in personam jurisdiction, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(2). None of these rulings have been contested on appeal and we abjure any further discussion of them.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Withal, the district court permitted the negligent supervision claim to go forward and subsequently allowed the appellants to add a straight negligence claim under the FTCA. Both claims were premised on the allegation that the FBI's withholding of the above-described 302 reports deprived the appellants of the benefit of exculpatory evidence before and during the criminal trial, and thus led to their wrongful convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties engaged in extensive discovery. The government challenged the existence of subject matter jurisdiction for the first time in a motion served almost two months after the deadline for filing dispositive motions had passed. Subject matter jurisdiction is not waivable, and a party cannot confer subject matter jurisdiction upon a federal court by failing to assert that defense in a timely manner. <i>See Quinn v. City of Boston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200396\"><a href=\"/opinion/200396/quinn-v-menino/\"><span class=\"volume\">325</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir.2003); <i>Irving v.

Still, the belated filing of a motion to dismiss for want of subject matter jurisdiction can have consequences in terms of a court's case-management decisions. So it was here: the district court elected to withhold consideration of the jurisdictional issue until after the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants' two remaining claims &#8212; negligence and negligent supervision under the FTCA &#8212; were tried to the district court for four days. The court then requested post-trial briefing. The government's memorandum raised a litany of defenses, including a renewed plea that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 2, 2003, the district court filed a lengthy rescript in which it ordered judgment in favor of the United States on the ground that the appellants had not proved that the FBI's failure to provide the exculpatory 302 reports had harmed them. <i>See Bolduc,</i> 265 F.Supp.2d at 154, 171. The court's rationale is complicated, <i>see id.</i> at 154, 169-71, and the appellants bitterly dispute it. We need not set foot on that battlefield: federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction and, in the circumstances of this case, we consider ourselves bound to address the jurisdictional issue first, regardless of the government's failure to raise it in a more timely fashion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See Irving,</i> 162 F.3d at 160 (admonishing that the federal courts \"have an affirmative obligation to examine jurisdictional concerns on their own initiative\" even if the parties have neglected them); <i>Berner v. Delahanty,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197623\"><a href=\"/opinion/197623/berner-v-delahanty/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 23 (1st Cir.1997) (noting \"that a court should first confirm the existence of rudiments such as jurisdiction ... before tackling the merits of a controverted case\"). As matters turn out, resolution of that issue terminates this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consistent with the foregoing, we turn directly to the jurisdictional issue. We begin with first principles: it is apodictic that \"[a]s a sovereign nation, the United States is immune from liability except to the extent that it consents to suit.\" <i>Dynamic Image Techs., Inc. v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199029\"><a href=\"/opinion/199029/dynamic-image-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 39 (1st Cir.2000). The FTCA evinces a waiver of sovereign immunity with respect to certain categories of torts committed by federal employees in the scope of their employment. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1346(b)(1). It simultaneously grants the federal district courts jurisdiction over such claims. <i>See id.; see also FDIC v. Meyer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112931\"><a href=\"/opinion/112931/fdic-v-meyer/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">471</span></a></span>, 475-77, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112931\"><a href=\"/opinion/112931/fdic-v-meyer/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">308</span></a></span> (1994). Thus, we must determine whether this waiver of sovereign immunity extends to the appellants' claims of negligence and negligent supervision, so that those claims fall within the jurisdictional grant of section 1346(b)(1). <i>See Meyer,</i> 510 U.S. at 477, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112931\"><a href=\"/opinion/112931/fdic-v-meyer/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

A further explication of the last clause is to be found in 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2674, which provides that the United States only \"shall be liable ... in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.\" A bundle of exceptions, mostly in the nature of exclusions and carve-outs, circumscribes the FTCA's waiver of sovereign immunity. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2680(a)-(n); <i>see also Dynamic Image Techs.,</i> 221 F.3d at 39.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add a caveat. As with all waivers of sovereign immunity, the FTCA must be \"construed strictly in favor of the federal government, and must not be enlarged beyond such boundaries as its language plainly requires.\" <i>United States v.

Stat. &#167; 971.23(1)). This effort is unconvincing. By the FTCA's plain terms, a waiver of sovereign immunity attaches only where \"a <i>private person</i> [] would be held liable.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1346(b)(1) (emphasis supplied). The appellants have not pointed to any instance in which Wisconsin has imposed <i>private</i> liability on a prosecutor or other state agent for a failure to disclose exculpatory evidence. That is a fatal flaw, for the federal government does not yield its immunity with respect to obligations that are peculiar to governments or official-capacity state actors and which have no private counterpart in state law. <i>See Franco de Jerez v.

We nonetheless must inquire whether there is any way in which Wisconsin might impose tort liability upon a private party under circumstances sufficiently similar to those present in this case, that is, a person who comes into possession of exculpatory evidence as part of an official investigation and carelessly fails to disclose that evidence to prosecutors (and, ultimately, to the accused). This means, in effect, that we must look for \"some relationship between the governmental employee[s] and plaintiff to which state law would attach a duty of care in purely private circumstances.\" <i>Sea Air Shuttle,</i> 112 F.3d at 537 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In formulating its test for negligence, Wisconsin has adopted a broad definition of the element of duty. <i>See A.E.

As a result of this choice, Wisconsin courts, rather than examining the relationship between the parties to determine the existence vel non of a duty, focus on the foreseeability of harm in order to ascertain whether a duty arises.

In these general terms, then, a private person might be said to owe a duty to a person suspected of crime-the duty being to exercise due care in the handling of exculpatory evidence so as to prevent the foreseeable harm of wrongful conviction. <i>Cf. Bowen v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas.

Under the FTCA, the relevant inquiry is not whether state law might assign a duty to a private person in the same or similar circumstances, but, rather, whether state law would impose liability on a private person in the same or similar circumstances. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1346(b)(1), 2674. The stating of a claim for negligence (the failure to exercise due care by one having a general duty to do so in the face of foreseeable harm) does not automatically mean that liability would attach under Wisconsin law. The contrary is true: \"[i]n Wisconsin, the doctrine of public policy, not the doctrine of duty, limits the scope of a defendant's liability.\" <i>Bowen,</i> 517 N.W.2d at 439; <i>see also Rockweit,</i> 541 N.W.2d at 750 (stating that \"the determination to deny liability is essentially one of public policy rather than of duty or causation\"); <i>Schuster v.

The Wisconsin Supreme Court has enumerated six factors relevant to this determination. <i>See Miller,</i> 580 N.W.2d at 240.

The plaintiff asserted that the doctor's negligent performance of the autopsy and subsequent proffer of a flawed cause-of-death opinion led directly to the plaintiff's arrest, prosecution, and resulting damages. <i>See id.</i> at 150. The court framed the question presented by the plaintiff's suit as whether, assuming that negligence and causation were present, the plaintiff's interest in \"freedom from unjustifiable criminal litigation\" is the \"type of interest [that] is protected against unintentional invasion.\" <i>Id.</i> at 151.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then undertook a public policy analysis to determine whether imposing liability on the doctor would be appropriate. It began by noting that \"[t]he law, for reasons of policy, closely circumscribes the types of causes of action which may arise against those who participate in law enforcement activity or in the functioning of the judicial system.\" <i>Id.</i> at 152. It went on to observe that, in civil litigation, such defendants often have a relationship to the judicial process that affords them immunity from private liability. <i>See id.</i> (citing the protections afforded to, inter alios, prosecutors and witnesses). It next determined that, even when a defendant's relationship to the judicial process does not afford a specific immunity, \"he is still not held liable to the person who has been subjected to unjustifiable prosecution in the absence of malice.\" <i>Id.</i> at 153.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's reasoning is instructive. In its view, law enforcement and the safeguarding of society from crime would suffer if government agents (and outsiders hired to assist in law enforcement activities) were subject to private liability for damages arising from simple negligence in the performance of their duties. <i>See id.</i> at 153-54. The <i>Bromund</i> court held that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">even if a person employed by the public to assist in law enforcement... does not enjoy immunity, ... the same considerations of public policy which require proof of malice as an element of an action for malicious prosecution or defamation under these circumstances must exclude liability founded upon mere negligence. In our opinion, the interest in freedom from unjustifiable criminal litigation is, as a matter of policy, not protected from unintentional tort.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 154.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This holding has particular pertinence for present purposes. Assuming arguendo that the appellants could demonstrate negligence, causation, and actual harm &#8212; a matter on which we take no view &#8212; Wisconsin law nonetheless would preclude the imposition of private liability on a private person in circumstances similar to those of Agent Craft.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Under <i>Bromund,</i> malice is a prerequisite for imposing private tort liability upon a private individual working with law enforcement when the performance of his duties has resulted in an unjustifiable criminal prosecution and/or conviction. <i>See id.</i> at 153-54. Because the appellants have failed to offer a scintilla of proof of malice, they have failed to establish a basis under the law of the place for imposing liability upon a private person in like circumstances. Consequently, we hold that the FTCA does not waive the federal government's sovereign immunity vis-a-vis the appellants' negligence claim. It follows inexorably that there is no federal subject matter jurisdiction over that component of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The Negligent Supervision Claim.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves the negligent supervision claim. Wisconsin recognizes the tort of negligent supervision. <i>Miller,</i> 580 N.W.2d at 241. Under Wisconsin law, a breach of the general duty to supervise is actionable if two causation components exist: first, the wrongful act of an employee must have been a cause-in-fact of the plaintiff's injury; second, the employer's negligence must have been a cause-in-fact of the employee's wrongful act. <i>Id.</i> at 239. For these purposes, it is not necessary that the employee's wrongful act, in and of itself, constitute an actionable tort. <i>Id.</i> Hence, our conclusion that the United States cannot be held vicariously liable for Agent Craft's negligence in the handling of exculpatory evidence, <i>see supra</i> Part III(A), does not negate the possibility that the United States might be held directly liable for negligent supervision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not hazard a public policy analysis to determine whether a private employer in like circumstances would face liability for negligent supervision under Wisconsin law. Even if the appellants could successfully urge the affirmative of that proposition &#8212; a matter on which we do not opine &#8212; the discretionary function exception to the FTCA, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2680(a), would divest the federal courts of jurisdiction over this claim.

If, however, the court concludes that the conduct is a product of discretion, it then must determine whether the exercise of that discretion is susceptible to policy-related judgments. <i>See Berkovitz,</i> 486 U.S. at 537, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112093\"><a href=\"/opinion/112093/berkovitz-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

This argument confuses the ministerial duty of FBI agents to place all 302 reports in the case file with the responsibility of FBI supervisors to oversee the work of the agents under their command. It is the latter activity that gives rise to the negligent supervision claim. On this issue, it is irrelevant whether Agent Craft had discretion to determine whether particular 302 reports should be left out of the case file. <i>See Attallah,</i> 955 F.2d at 783 (explaining that the judicial inquiry must focus \"on the permissible range of action available to the government employee allegedly at fault\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having identified the relevant activity &#8212; the FBI's oversight of Agent Craft's handling of the 302s &#8212; we next must consider whether that activity is discretionary and susceptible to policy-related judgments. The appellants assign fault at a general level to the quality of the supervision. At trial, they adduced evidence that Agent Craft sometimes initialed 302 reports and other documents without reviewing them thoroughly (even though his supervisors had advised him to be more fastidious in performing that task) and that one supervisor had written a performance appraisal suggesting that Craft had room for improvement in this area. The appellants have not shown, however, that Craft's supervisors were constrained by any law, regulation, or policy to respond in a particular way upon learning that an agent was not proficient at a particular task. By the same token, they have not adverted to any federal statute, regulation, or policy that dictates a specific regime of oversight that FBI hierarchs must practice to ensure that agents handle exculpatory evidence properly. Where no specific action is required within a category of conduct and the government actors in question have latitude to make decisions and choose among alternative courses of action, the conduct is discretionary. <i>See Irving,</i> 162 F.3d at 163-64.

There, we held that supervisory decisions of the Customs Service concerning the oversight of customs agents were discretionary in nature. <i>See Attallah,</i> 955 F.2d at 784-85.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants argue that, notwithstanding this precedent, the supervisory decision here is beyond the domain of discretion. They assert that even if a claim for negligent supervision would generally be barred, the bar should not apply here because it is unlawful for a member of the prosecution team to withhold exculpatory evidence and it cannot be within an official's discretion to permit unlawful behavior. To bolster this construct, they cite <i>Tonelli v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"699613\"><a href=\"/opinion/699613/mike-tonelli-cindy-tonelli-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></a></span> (8th Cir.1995), for the proposition that \"[f]ailure to act after notice of illegal action does not represent a choice based on plausible policy considerations.\" <i>Id.</i> at 496.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Tonelli</i> is easily distinguishable. The court there recognized that \"[i]ssues of employee supervision ... generally involve the permissible exercise of policy judgment and fall within the discretionary function exception,\" <i>id.,</i> but left open the possibility that an employer who had notice of ongoing illegal activity would not be entitled to claim that a failure to act was within the scope of discretion, <i>see id.</i> It therefore determined that summary judgment would be inappropriate because a factual dispute persisted over whether the employer had notice of the illegal actions of its employees. <i>Id.</i> In this case, unlike in <i>Tonelli,</i> we have the benefit of a full trial record, and we find nothing to support the premise that FBI supervisors in the Milwaukee office had notice of any illegal employee activity. As a result, we need not decide whether that situation would be subject to the conclusions that we otherwise reach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this aspect of the matter. In <i>Attallah,</i> we commented that supervision over customs agents \"certainly involves a degree of discretion ... of the kind that Congress sought to protect through the discretionary function exception.\" 955 F.2d at 784. We think that comment is fully applicable here. Accordingly, we hold that the FBI's supervision of Craft's job performance was discretionary in nature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We come, then, to the question of whether this discretionary conduct was grounded in policy. On that issue, the government benefits from the presumption that a supervisor's discretionary acts are grounded in policy. <i>See United States v. Gaubert,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112567\"><a href=\"/opinion/112567/united-states-v-gaubert/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">315</span></a></span>, 324, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112567\"><a href=\"/opinion/112567/united-states-v-gaubert/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1267</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112567\"><a href=\"/opinion/112567/united-states-v-gaubert/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span> (1991); <i>Muniz-Rivera,</i> 326 F.3d at 17. It is the plaintiff's burden to rebut this presumption and demonstrate that particular discretionary conduct is not susceptible to policy-related judgments. <i>See Shansky,</i> 164 F.3d at 692. In this instance, the appellants have wholly failed to carry that burden. We conclude, therefore, that the FBI's supervisory decisions were a matter of agency discretion and involved policy judgments of a kind that the discretionary function proviso was intended to shield. <i>See Attallah,</i> 955 F.2d at 784.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more on this point would be to paint the lily. Based on the foregoing, we hold that the discretionary function proviso, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2680(a), divests the federal courts of jurisdiction over the appellants' claim of negligent supervision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is a sad case. It shows that even the nation's premier law enforcement agency sometimes bungles. But Congress has never enacted a wholesale waiver of the federal government's sovereign immunity from suit, so it is unsurprising that the FTCA does not cover every error by a federal agent. Neither of the two claims at issue here &#8212; one for negligence and the other for negligent supervision &#8212; comes within the carapace of the carefully limited waiver of federal sovereign immunity that the FTCA denotes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. We hold that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear the appellants' claims. On this ground, we affirm the entry of judgment in favor of the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Larkin died while this suit was pending and the administrator of his estate has been substituted as a party plaintiff in his place and stead<i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 25(a).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The court sentenced Bolduc to 280 months for the attempted robbery at Southgate (count 1), 60 months for a related firearms charge (count 2), 280 months for the Oklahoma Avenue robbery (count 3), and 240 months for a related firearms charge (count 4). The sentences on counts 1 and 3 were to run concurrently, followed by the sentence for count 2 and, finally, the sentence for count 4. The court sentenced Larkin to concurrent terms for counts 1 and 3 (each 90 months), followed by a consecutive 60-month term for count 2 and a further consecutive 240-month term for count 4</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> On October 21, 2002, the lower court granted the appellants' motion to transfer the claim against Craft to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin.
