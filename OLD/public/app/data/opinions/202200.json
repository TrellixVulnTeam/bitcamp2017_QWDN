Hernández-\nVenegas, of Schuster Usera & Aguiló LLP, on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n\n                             May 8, 2006\n\n\n\n     *\n      Of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit,\nsitting by designation.\n\f     HANSEN, Senior Circuit Judge. Carlos Fontánez-Núñez, his wife\n\nNora Rivera-Cardenales, and the Conjugal Partnership Fontánez-\n\nRivera (collectively \"Fontánez\") brought suit under Title VII of\n\nthe Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e-2000h-6, and the Age\n\nDiscrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. §§ 621-634,\n\nclaiming gender and age discrimination in employment as well as a\n\nhostile environment.    The district court dismissed the claims\n\nagainst the individual defendants and granted summary judgment to\n\nthe corporate defendants, Janssen Ortho LLC and Johnson & Johnson,\n\nInc. (collectively \"Janssen\").        Fontánez appeals the grant of\n\nsummary judgment, arguing that the existence of material issues of\n\nfact make summary judgment inappropriate.     We affirm.\n\n                                 I.\n\n     We ordinarily state the facts in a summary judgment context in\n\nthe light most favorable to the nonmoving party.    See Cordero-Soto\n\nv. Island Finance, Inc., 418 F.3d 114, 119 (1st Cir. 2005).        In\n\nthis case, however, the district court accepted as true all of\n\nJanssen's uncontested facts because Fontánez had failed to oppose\n\nJanssen's statement of uncontested facts as required by Local Civil\n\nRule (L.Cv.R.) 56(c) (requiring a party opposing a summary judgment\n\nmotion to \"admit, deny, or qualify the facts by reference to each\n\nnumbered paragraph of the moving party's statement\" and to \"support\n\neach denial or qualification by a record citation\").       See L.Cv.R.\n\n56(e) (stating that facts supported by record citations \"shall be\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fdeemed admitted unless properly controverted\").       We recite an\n\nabbreviated version of the facts accepted as true by the district\n\ncourt, and we view other facts gleaned from the record in the light\n\nmost favorable to Fontánez, unless they are inconsistent with the\n\nuncontested facts stated by Janssen.\n\n     Carlos Fontánez-Núñez worked for Janssen Ortho LLC from July\n\n1996 until his termination in 2001. Throughout those years, he was\n\npromoted and received several salary increases.    Two of his early\n\npositions with the company were in the Quicksolv Department.     He\n\nreported to Angel Natal who he alleges created a discriminatory and\n\nhostile work environment.   Specifically, Fontánez said that Natal\n\nused foul language and often made sexual and gender-based harassing\n\ncomments to him or in his presence.    He said Natal would call him\n\n\"gray haired\" or would tell him he looked like a certain co-worker\n\nwho was considered to be slow and incompetent.     Fontánez states\n\nthat co-workers would call him \"la cacatua\" (the cockatoo) behind\n\nhis back because of his gray hair.     According to Fontánez, Natal\n\nalso made offensive comments referencing homosexual activity, once\n\nnoting that Fontánez was a pharmacist and expressing an opinion, in\n\nvulgar terms, that all pharmacists are homosexuals.        Fontánez\n\nstated that co-workers would then call him (Fontánez) gay or would\n\nask him whether he was gay. Fontánez admitted that these incidents\n\noccurred in 1997.\n\n\n\n\n                                -3-\n\f       In October 1998, Fontánez performed well and was promoted to\n\nthe    position     of     Quicksolv          Project      Leader,       which    gave     him\n\nsupervisory responsibility and a new supervisor, Quicksolv and\n\nEngineering Director Luis Guillermo Pérez.                            Meanwhile, Natal had\n\nbeen transferred to the Packaging Department as Packaging Manager.\n\nIn 1999, when the company closed its Quicksolv Department, Natal\n\nrecommended       Fontánez     for       a    newly       created       Packaging    Manager\n\nposition, and the company offered Fontánez the position.\n\n       Fontánez's performance as Packaging Manager, however, only\n\nmarginally met the company's expectations.                            Fontánez lacked the\n\nability    to     make     prompt    decisions            and    lacked     certain      basic\n\nadministrative skills required for the position. During his tenure\n\nas    Packaging    Manager,       deficiencies            in    his    performance    caused\n\nuntimely   product        packaging,          in   turn    resulting       in    unfulfilled\n\nproduct orders.           Additionally, he failed to implement certain\n\nmeasures required for FDA compliance.                           Natal provided him some\n\ninformal counseling in areas in which he needed to improve his job\n\nperformance.\n\n       Fontánez asserts that Natal's harassment continued through\n\nFebruary    2001,        though     he       was   not     always       Fontánez's    direct\n\nsupervisor.     Specifically, sometime in early 2001, Natal allegedly\n\nremarked in quite vulgar terms to Fontánez that he (Natal) was\n\nlooking for a homosexual to engage in sexual relations with him.\n\nFontánez complained that Natal would straighten the front of\n\n\n                                               -4-\n\fNatal's pants or touch his own buttocks in Fontánez's presence and\n\nthat Natal continued to use foul and vulgar language in the\n\nworkplace.    Fontánez stated that these actions made him feel\n\nnervous, made him put forth a greater effort than others to gain\n\nacknowledgment, and made him feel he must speak succinctly at\n\nmeetings or be told to shut up.\n\n     In   March   2000,   Fontánez's   then-supervisor,   Aixa   Berríos,\n\nPackaging and Materials Manager, met with Fontánez to discuss\n\nseveral performance-related issues. She documented his performance\n\ndeficiencies in writing and advised him that improved performance\n\non his part was necessary to avoid further disciplinary action.\n\n     In February 2001, the company eliminated Fontánez's Packaging\n\nManager position as part of its implementation of a plan known as\n\nthe Lean Manufacturing Process.        Rather than terminate Fontánez,\n\nthe company assigned him to the position of Senior Packaging\n\nProcess Facilitator, with supervisory authority over approximately\n\nthirty-two employees.      Berríos remained his supervisor.       Due to\n\nseveral   deficiencies    in   Fontánez's   job   performance,   Berríos\n\nconcluded that Fontánez was not performing the job at an acceptable\n\nlevel of competence.       She recommended his termination in March\n\n2001.     Carlos Otero, Human Resources Director, reviewed that\n\nrecommendation, and Jorge Ros, Plant Manager, made the ultimate\n\ndecision to terminate Fontánez on April 23, 2001.         Natal was not\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\finvolved in the termination decision and was no longer Fontánez's\n\nsupervisor at the time of his termination.\n\n     At all relevant times, Janssen had well-established policies\n\ndesigned to prevent discriminatory conduct and sexual harassment in\n\nthe workplace.     These policies included a complaint mechanism for\n\nemployees.      Fontánez received a copy of this policy.            Although\n\naware of the company's antidiscrimination policies and procedures,\n\nFontánez complained of harassing conduct to a supervisor only once.\n\nFontánez states that he told Pérez of the harassing conduct in\n\n1997.    Pérez did not play a role in the decision to terminate\n\nFontánez, and Fontánez did not thereafter use Janssen's sexual\n\nharassment policies or its established complaint mechanism.\n\n     On May 2, 2001, Fontánez filed a charge of discrimination with\n\nthe Anti-Discrimination Unit of the Puerto Rico Department of\n\nLabor. Fontánez then filed suit in federal court, alleging that he\n\nsuffered a hostile work environment due to sexual harassment by his\n\nsupervisor, Angel Natal, and that he was terminated on the basis of\n\nhis gender and age in violation of Title VII, the ADEA, and Puerto\n\nRico law.      The district court granted the plaintiffs' request for\n\nvoluntary dismissal of the Puerto Rico law claims and issued a\n\npartial summary judgment dismissing with prejudice the Title VII\n\nand ADEA claims against the individual defendants – Natal, Ros,\n\nOtero,   and    Berríos.   Janssen    sought   summary   judgment    on   the\n\nremaining claims.      The district court granted Janssen's summary\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fjudgment motion, concluding that many of the acts complained of\n\nwere time-barred, that Fontánez had not established a prima facie\n\ncase of age discrimination, and that there was no evidence of\n\nactionable sexual harassment or a hostile environment.      Fontánez\n\nappeals.\n\n                               II.\n\n     \"We review the grant of summary judgment de novo, based on the\n\nrecord as it stood before the district court.\"   Cordero-Soto, 418\n\nF.3d at 118.    Summary judgment is proper \"if the pleadings,\n\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\n\ntogether with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled\n\nto a judgment as a matter of law.\"   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).   \"Once\n\nthe moving party avers the absence of genuine issues of material\n\nfact, the nonmovant must show that a factual dispute does exist,\n\nbut summary judgment cannot be defeated by relying on improbable\n\ninferences, conclusory allegations, or rank speculation.\"     Ingram\n\nv. Brink's, Inc., 414 F.3d 222, 228-29 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n     Fontánez attempts to argue on appeal that factual disputes\n\nexist to preclude summary judgment, but his argument wholly ignores\n\nthe district court's decision to deem Janssen's statement of\n\nuncontroverted facts as true pursuant to Local Rule 56(e).    \"This\n\ncourt has held repeatedly that the district court in Puerto Rico is\n\njustified in holding one party's submitted uncontested facts to be\n\n\n\n                               -7-\n\fadmitted   when   the   other   party   fails   to   file    oppositions   in\n\ncompliance with local rules.\"      Torres-Rosado v. Rotger-Sabat, 335\n\nF.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2003).       \"This, of course, does not mean the\n\nunopposed party wins on summary judgment; that party's uncontested\n\nfacts and other evidentiary facts of record must still show that\n\nthe party is entitled to summary judgment.\"          Id.    Because Fontánez\n\ndoes not argue that the district court erred in deeming Janssen's\n\nuncontested facts as true, he has waived the issue.            See id. at 5.\n\nWe thus consider the record as it existed before the district\n\ncourt, deeming Janssen's uncontested facts admitted.            Id.\n\n     Fontánez first asserts that the district court erred in\n\nconcluding that most of the discrete acts of discrimination alleged\n\nare time-barred.    We find no error.      The district court correctly\n\nnoted that the administrative charge was filed on May 2, 2001, and\n\nconsequently held that all discrete actions of harassment or\n\ndiscriminatory conduct occurring before July 25, 2000 (300 days\n\nbefore the claim was filed), are time-barred.                See Nat'l R.R.\n\nPassenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 113 (2002) (\"[D]iscrete\n\ndiscriminatory acts are not actionable if time barred,\" and \"[e]ach\n\ndiscrete discriminatory act starts a new clock for filing charges\n\n. . . within the 180- or 300-day time period after the discrete\n\ndiscriminatory act occurred.\"); see also 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(1)\n\nand 29 U.S.C. § 626(d).\n\n\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\f      Our review of the record convinces us that the district court\n\nproperly granted summary judgment to Janssen on Fontánez's claims\n\nof gender and age discrimination in his termination.              Fontánez has\n\npresented no direct evidence of age or gender discrimination and\n\nmust therefore raise an inference of discrimination through the\n\nfamiliar McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework.               McDonnell\n\nDouglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-05 (1973).              See Rivera-\n\nAponte v. Restaurant Metropol # 3, Inc., 338 F.3d 9, 11 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).     Under this framework, to raise an inference of either age\n\nor gender discrimination sufficient to withstand summary judgment,\n\nit is necessary for a plaintiff to demonstrate, inter alia, that\n\nhis   or    her   job   performance    met   the     employer's    legitimate\n\nexpectations.     See, e.g., Hoffman v. Applicators Sales and Serv.,\n\nInc., 439 F.3d 9, 17 (1st Cir. 2006)(stating the elements for a\n\nprima facie case of age discrimination); Smith v. Stratus Computer,\n\nInc., 40 F.3d 11, 15 (1st Cir. 1994)(stating the elements for a\n\nprima facie case of sex discrimination), cert. denied, 514 U.S.\n\n1108 (1995).      Fontánez cannot make this showing.         The undisputed\n\nevidence    establishes   that   Fontánez's    job    performance     was   not\n\nmeeting his employer's legitimate expectations at the time of his\n\ntermination.\n\n      Fontánez attempts to justify his job performance by asserting\n\ndisputed facts in his argument to this court.                The facts of\n\nJanssen's statement of uncontested facts, however, are deemed\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fadmitted and may not now be controverted.          The record demonstrates\n\nthat Fontánez held five different positions with Janssen, each with\n\na higher salary than the last, but he did not perform well in the\n\nlast two positions.     Janssen appointed Fontánez to the Process\n\nFacilitator position rather than fire him when his prior position\n\nwas eliminated, Fontánez was aware of the responsibilities of the\n\njob when he accepted the position, and Janssen terminated Fontánez\n\nfor unacceptable performance of those responsibilities in several\n\nrespects. Accordingly, the district court properly granted summary\n\njudgment on Fontánez's age and gender discrimination claims.\n\n      Even putting aside the prima facie case, as we have often\n\ndone, and turning \"instead, to whether there is evidence that,\n\nnotwithstanding the employer's stated reasons for the termination,\n\nthe   real   reason,   at   least    in    part,    was   age   and   gender\n\ndiscrimination,\" Hillstrom v. Best Western TLC Hotel, 354 F.3d 27,\n\n31 (1st Cir. 2003), we conclude that summary judgment was proper.\n\nThere is no evidence from which to conclude that the proffered\n\nreason for his termination was not in fact the real reason.\n\nFontánez has not presented evidence from which to conclude that\n\nJanssen's job expectations were illegitimate. Additionally, he has\n\nnot presented any evidence to demonstrate that either age or gender\n\ndiscrimination was the real reason for the termination – or even a\n\nmotivating influence in the decision. See Hoffman, 439 F.3d at 17-\n\n\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\f18 (citing Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., 530 U.S. 133, 141\n\n(2000)).\n\n     Fontánez also claims that he suffered sexual harassment and a\n\nhostile work environment based on conduct by his supervisor, Natal,\n\nand co-workers.     Natal did not participate in the decision to\n\nterminate   Fontánez,     and    Fontánez   does   not   claim    that    he   was\n\nconstructively discharged due to the harassing conduct.              \"[When] a\n\nsupervisor's harassment did not result in a tangible employment\n\naction against an employee, then the employee must show that the\n\nharassment was so 'severe or pervasive' that, in essence, it\n\naltered the terms or conditions of her [or his] employment.\"                   Lee-\n\nCrespo v. Schering-Plough Del Caribe Inc., 354 F.3d 34, 46 (1st\n\nCir. 2003) (quoting Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S.\n\n742, 752 (1998)).       \"The employer is then vicariously liable . . .\n\nunless   the   employer    can    successfully     assert   the    affirmative\n\ndefense\" that it took reasonable care to promptly correct the\n\nsituation   or   that    the    plaintiff   unreasonably    failed       to    take\n\nadvantage of the corrective or preventive measures provided by the\n\nemployer. Id. (citing Ellerth, 524 U.S. at 765).                  \"[W]here the\n\nharassment is by a non-supervisory co-worker, the employer is\n\nliable only if the plaintiff can show that the employer knew or\n\nshould have known of the charged . . . harassment and failed to\n\nimplement prompt and appropriate action.\"            Arrieta-Colon v. Wal-\n\n\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fMart   Puerto      Rico,   Inc.,   434    F.3d      75,   85-86   (1st   Cir.   2006)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted, alteration in original).\n\n       We consider all of the circumstances \"in determining whether\n\na work environment is sufficiently hostile or abusive, including\n\n'the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether\n\nit was physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive\n\nutterance;      and   whether      it    unreasonably       interferes     with   an\n\nemployee's work performance.'\" Lee-Crespo, 354 F.3d at 46 (quoting\n\nHarris v. Forklift Sys., 510 U.S. 17, 23 (1993)).                   A hostile work\n\nenvironment claim is composed of a series of separate acts, but as\n\nlong as \"an act contributing to the claim occurs within the filing\n\nperiod, the entire time period of the hostile environment may be\n\nconsidered by a court for the purposes of determining liability.\"\n\nMorgan, 536 U.S. at 117.\n\n       We agree with the district court's assessment that the facts\n\nof this case do not rise to the level of severity or pervasiveness\n\nconsidered to be actionable.             Natal's purported continued use of\n\nobjectionable language and vulgar remarks in Fontánez's presence\n\nwere, according to Fontánez, often directed to many employees in\n\nthe area or described Natal's own conduct.                        While the vulgar\n\nlanguage     was    inappropriate        to   the    workplace     and   completely\n\nunprofessional, mere offensive utterances that did not unreasonably\n\ninterfere with the employee's work performance do not amount to\n\nharassment that in essence altered the terms or conditions of\n\n\n\n                                         -12-\n\fFontánez's employment.          See Lee-Crespo, 354 F.3d at 46-47 (\"[A]\n\nsupervisor's unprofessional managerial approach . . . [is] not the\n\nfocus of the discrimination laws.\").

The district court dismissed the claims against the individual defendants and granted summary judgment to the corporate defendants, Janssen Ortho LLC and Johnson &amp; Johnson, Inc. (collectively \"Janssen\"). Font&#225;nez appeals the grant of summary judgment, arguing that the existence of material issues of fact make summary judgment inappropriate.

Island Finance, Inc.,</i> 418 F.3d 114, 119 (1st Cir.2005). In this case, however, the district court accepted as true all of Janssen's uncontested facts because Font&#225;nez had failed to oppose Janssen's statement of uncontested facts as required by Local Civil Rule (L.Cv.R.) 56(c) (requiring a party opposing a summary judgment motion to \"admit, deny, or qualify the facts by reference to each numbered paragraph of the moving party's statement\" and to \"support each denial or qualification by a record citation\"). <i>See</i> L.Cv.R. 56(e) (stating that facts supported by record citations \"shall be deemed admitted unless properly controverted\"). We recite an abbreviated version of the facts accepted as true by the district court, and we view other facts gleaned from the record in the light most favorable to Font&#225;nez, unless they are inconsistent with the uncontested facts stated by Janssen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carlos Font&#225;nez-N&#250;&#241;ez worked for Janssen Ortho LLC from July 1996 until his termination in 2001. Throughout those years, he was promoted and received several salary increases. Two of his early positions with the company were in the Quicksolv Department. He reported to Angel Natal who he alleges created a discriminatory and hostile work environment. Specifically, Font&#225;nez said that Natal used foul language and often made sexual and gender-based harassing comments to him or in his presence. He said Natal would call him \"gray haired\" or would tell him he looked like a certain co-worker who was considered to be slow and incompetent. Font&#225;nez states that co-workers would call him \"la cacatua\" (the cockatoo) behind his back because of his gray hair. According to Font&#225;nez, Natal also made offensive comments referencing homosexual activity, once noting that Font&#225;nez was a pharmacist and expressing an opinion, in vulgar terms, that all pharmacists are homosexuals. Font&#225;nez stated that co-workers would then call him (Font&#225;nez) gay or would ask him whether he was gay. Font&#225;nez admitted that these incidents occurred in 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1998, Font&#225;nez performed well and was promoted to the position of Quicksolv Project Leader, which gave him supervisory responsibility and a new supervisor, Quicksolv and Engineering Director Luis Guillermo P&#233;rez. Meanwhile, Natal had been transferred to the Packaging Department as Packaging Manager. In 1999, when the company closed its Quicksolv Department, Natal recommended Font&#225;nez for a newly created Packaging Manager position, and the company offered Font&#225;nez the position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Font&#225;nez's performance as Packaging Manager, however, only marginally met the company's expectations. Font&#225;nez lacked the ability to make prompt decisions and lacked certain basic administrative skills required for the position. During his tenure as Packaging Manager, deficiencies in his performance caused untimely product packaging, in turn resulting in unfulfilled product orders. Additionally, he failed to implement certain measures required for FDA compliance. Natal provided him some informal counseling in areas in which he needed to improve his job performance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Font&#225;nez asserts that Natal's harassment continued through February 2001, though he was not always Font&#225;nez's direct supervisor. Specifically, sometime in early 2001, Natal allegedly remarked in quite vulgar terms to Font&#225;nez that he (Natal) was looking for a homosexual to engage in sexual relations with him. Font&#225;nez complained that Natal would straighten the front of Natal's pants or touch his own buttocks in Font&#225;nez's presence and that Natal continued to use foul and vulgar language in the workplace. Font&#225;nez stated that these actions made him feel nervous, made him put forth a greater effort than others to gain acknowledgment, and made him feel he must speak succinctly at meetings or be told to shut up.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 2000, Font&#225;nez's then-supervisor, Aixa Berr&#237;os, Packaging and Materials Manager, met with Font&#225;nez to discuss several performance-related issues. She documented his performance deficiencies in writing and advised him that improved performance on his part was necessary to avoid further disciplinary action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 2001, the company eliminated Font&#225;nez's Packaging Manager position as part of its implementation of a plan known as the Lean Manufacturing Process. Rather than terminate Font&#225;nez, the company assigned him to the position of Senior Packaging Process Facilitator, with supervisory authority over approximately thirty-two employees. Berr&#237;os remained his supervisor. Due to several deficiencies in Font&#225;nez's job performance, Berr&#237;os concluded that Font&#225;nez was not performing the job at an acceptable level of competence. She recommended his termination in March 2001. Carlos Otero, Human Resources Director, reviewed that recommendation, and Jorge Ros, Plant Manager, made the ultimate decision to terminate Font&#225;nez on April 23, 2001. Natal was not involved in the termination decision and was no longer Font&#225;nez's supervisor at the time of his termination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At all relevant times, Janssen had well-established policies designed to prevent discriminatory conduct and sexual harassment in the workplace. These policies included a complaint mechanism for employees. Font&#225;nez received a copy of this policy. Although aware of the company's antidiscrimination policies and procedures, Font&#225;nez complained of harassing conduct to a supervisor only once. Font&#225;nez states that he told P&#233;rez of the harassing conduct in 1997. P&#233;rez did not play a role in the decision to terminate Font&#225;nez, and Font&#225;nez did not thereafter use Janssen's sexual harassment policies or its established complaint mechanism.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 2, 2001, Font&#225;nez filed a charge of discrimination with the Anti-Discrimination Unit of the Puerto Rico Department of Labor. Font&#225;nez then filed suit in federal court, alleging that he suffered a hostile work environment due to sexual harassment by his supervisor, Angel Natal, and that he was terminated on the basis of his gender and age in violation of Title VII, the ADEA, and Puerto Rico law. The district court granted the plaintiffs' request for voluntary dismissal of the Puerto Rico law claims and issued a partial summary judgment dismissing with prejudice the Title VII and ADEA claims against the individual defendants &#8212; Natal, Ros, Otero, and Berr&#237;os. Janssen sought summary judgment on the remaining claims. The district court granted Janssen's summary judgment motion, concluding that many of the acts complained of were time-barred, that Font&#225;nez had not established a prima facie case of age discrimination, and that there was no evidence of actionable sexual harassment or a hostile environment. Font&#225;nez appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"We review the grant of summary judgment <i>de novo,</i> based on the record as it stood before the district court.\" <i>Cordero-Soto,</i> 418 F.3d at 118. Summary judgment is proper \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). \"Once the moving party avers the absence of genuine issues of material fact, the nonmovant must show that a factual dispute does exist, but summary judgment cannot be defeated by relying on improbable inferences, conclusory allegations, or rank speculation.\" <i>Ingram v. Brink's, Inc.,</i> 414 F.3d 222, 228-29 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Font&#225;nez attempts to argue on appeal that factual disputes exist to preclude summary judgment, but his argument wholly ignores the district court's decision to deem Janssen's statement of uncontroverted facts as true pursuant to Local Rule 56(e). \"This court has held repeatedly that the district court in Puerto Rico is justified in holding one party's submitted uncontested facts to be admitted when the other party fails to file oppositions in compliance with local rules.\" <i>Torres-Rosado v. Rotger-Sabat,</i> 335 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2003). \"This, of course, does not mean the unopposed party wins on summary judgment; that party's uncontested facts and other evidentiary facts of record must still show that the party is entitled to summary judgment.\" <i>Id.</i> Because Font&#225;nez does not argue that the district court erred in deeming Janssen's uncontested facts as true, he has waived the issue. <i>See id.</i> at 5. We thus consider the record as it existed before the district court, deeming Janssen's uncontested facts admitted. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Font&#225;nez first asserts that the district court erred in concluding that most of the discrete acts of discrimination alleged are time-barred. We find no error. The district court correctly noted that the administrative charge was filed on May 2, 2001, and consequently held that all discrete actions of harassment or discriminatory conduct occurring before July 25, 2000 (300 days before the claim was filed), are time-barred. <i>See Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan,</i> 536 U.S. 101, 113, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 153 L.Ed.2d 106 (2002) (\"[D]iscrete discriminatory acts are not actionable if time barred,\" and \"[e]ach discrete discriminatory act starts a new clock for filing charges . . . within the 180- or 300-day time period after the discrete discriminatory act occurred.\"); <i>see also</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(e)(1) and 29 U.S.C. &#167; 626(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the record convinces us that the district court properly granted summary judgment to Janssen on Font&#225;nez's claims of gender and age discrimination in his termination. Font&#225;nez has presented no direct evidence of age or gender discrimination and must therefore raise an inference of discrimination through the familiar <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> burden-shifting framework. <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</i> 411 U.S. 792, 802-05, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <i>See Rivera-Aponte v. Restaurant Metropol # 3, Inc.,</i> 338 F.3d 9, 11 (1st Cir.2003). Under this framework, to raise an inference of either age or gender discrimination sufficient to withstand summary judgment, it is necessary for a plaintiff to demonstrate, <i>inter alia,</i> that his or her job performance met the employer's legitimate expectations. <i>See, e.g., Hoffman v. Applicators Sales and Serv., Inc.,</i> 439 F.3d 9, 17 (1st Cir.2006)(stating the elements for a prima facie case of age discrimination); <i>Smith v. Stratus Computer, Inc.,</i> 40 F.3d 11, 15 (1st Cir.1994)(stating the elements for a prima facie case of sex discrimination), <i>cert. denied,</i> 514 U.S. 1108, 115 S.Ct. 1958, 131 L.Ed.2d 850 (1995). Font&#225;nez cannot make this showing. The undisputed evidence establishes that Font&#225;nez's job performance was not meeting his employer's legitimate expectations at the time of his termination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Font&#225;nez attempts to justify his job performance by asserting disputed facts in his argument to this court. The facts of Janssen's statement of uncontested facts, however, are deemed admitted and may not now be controverted. The record demonstrates that Font&#225;nez held five different positions with Janssen, each with a higher salary than the last, but he did not perform well in the last two positions. Janssen appointed Font&#225;nez to the Process Facilitator position rather than fire him when his prior position was eliminated, Font&#225;nez was aware of the responsibilities of the job when he accepted the position, and Janssen terminated Font&#225;nez for unacceptable performance of those responsibilities in several respects. Accordingly, the district court properly granted summary judgment on Font&#225;nez's age and gender discrimination claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even putting aside the prima facie case, as we have often done, and turning \"instead, to whether there is evidence that, notwithstanding the employer's stated reasons for the termination, the real reason, at least in part, was age and gender discrimination,\" <i>Hillstrom v. Best Western TLC Hotel,</i> 354 F.3d 27, 31 (1st Cir.2003), we conclude that summary judgment was proper. There is no evidence from which to conclude that the proffered reason for his termination was not in fact the real reason. Font&#225;nez has not presented evidence from which to conclude that Janssen's job expectations were illegitimate. Additionally, he has not presented any evidence to demonstrate that either age or gender discrimination was the real reason for the termination &#8212; or even a motivating influence in the decision. <i>See Hoffman,</i> 439 F.3d at 17-18 (citing <i>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods.,</i> 530 U.S. 133, 141, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Font&#225;nez also claims that he suffered sexual harassment and a hostile work environment based on conduct by his supervisor, Natal, and co-workers. Natal did not participate in the decision to terminate Font&#225;nez, and Font&#225;nez does not claim that he was constructively discharged due to the harassing conduct. \"[When] a supervisor's harassment did not result in a tangible employment action against an employee, then the employee must show that the harassment was so `severe or pervasive' that, in essence, it altered the terms or conditions of her [or his] employment.\" <i>Lee-Crespo v. Schering-Plough Del Caribe Inc.,</i> 354 F.3d 34, 46 (1st Cir.2003) (quoting <i>Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth,</i> 524 U.S. 742, 752, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 141 L.Ed.2d 633 (1998)). \"The employer is then vicariously liable . . . unless the employer can successfully assert the affirmative defense\" that it took reasonable care to promptly correct the situation or that the plaintiff unreasonably failed to take advantage of the corrective or preventive measures provided by the employer. <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Ellerth,</i> 524 U.S. at 765, 118 S.Ct. 2257). \"[W]here the harassment is by a non-supervisory co-worker, the employer is liable only if the plaintiff can show that the employer knew or should have known of the charged . . . harassment and failed to implement prompt and appropriate action.\" <i>Arrieta-Colon v. Wal-Mart Puerto Rico, Inc.,</i> 434 F.3d 75, 85-86 (1st Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted, alteration in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We consider all of the circumstances \"in determining whether a work environment is sufficiently hostile or abusive, including `the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it was physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance.'\" <i>Lee-Crespo,</i> 354 F.3d at 46 (quoting <i>Harris v. Forklift Sys.,</i> 510 U.S. 17, 23, 114 S.Ct. 367, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993)). A hostile work environment claim is composed of a series of separate acts, but as long as \"an act contributing to the claim occurs within the filing period, the entire time period of the hostile environment may be considered by a court for the purposes of determining liability.\" <i>Morgan,</i> 536 U.S. at 117, 122 S.Ct. 2061.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court's assessment that the facts of this case do not rise to the level of severity or pervasiveness considered to be actionable. Natal's purported continued use of objectionable language and vulgar remarks in Font&#225;nez's presence were, according to Font&#225;nez, often directed to many employees in the area or described Natal's own conduct. While the vulgar language was inappropriate to the workplace and completely unprofessional, mere offensive utterances that did not unreasonably interfere with the employee's work performance do not amount to harassment that in essence altered the terms or conditions of Font&#225;nez's employment. <i>See Lee-Crespo,</i> 354 F.3d at 46-47 (\"[A] supervisor's unprofessional managerial approach . . . [is] not the focus of the discrimination laws.\"). Considering the whole record, we cannot find that \"the workplace [wa]s permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult that [wa]s sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of [Font&#225;nez's] employment and create an abusive working environment.\" <i>Morgan,</i> 536 U.S. at 116, 122 S.Ct. 2061 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, the undisputed facts establish that Janssen had well established anti-harassment and antidiscrimination policies that included procedures for employees to follow in airing grievances and that Font&#225;nez failed to take advantage of these procedures. Janssen's statement of undisputed facts establishes that Font&#225;nez's only complaint to a manager occurred in 1997, and he did not thereafter make use of the company's complaint procedures. Font&#225;nez attempts to contradict that fact, asserting on appeal that he \"sought help through the years from the superiors regarding the discrimination he was suffering at the hands first of Natal and then of Natal, Berr&#237;os and the others, but no one paid attention.\" (Appellants' Br. at 11.) On the record before us, including the facts deemed admitted, Font&#225;nez cannot now assert that he made timely complaints which were ignored.

Throughout those years, he was promoted and received several salary increases. Two of his early positions with the company were in the Quicksolv Department. He reported to Angel Natal who he alleges created a discriminatory and hostile work environment. Specifically, Font&#225;nez said that Natal used foul language and often made sexual and gender-based harassing comments to him or in his presence. He said Natal would call him \"gray haired\" or would tell him he looked like a certain co-worker who was considered to be slow and incompetent. Font&#225;nez states that co-workers would call him \"la cacatua\" (the cockatoo) behind his back because of his gray hair. According to Font&#225;nez, Natal also made offensive comments referencing homosexual activity, once noting that Font&#225;nez was a pharmacist and expressing an opinion, in vulgar terms, that all pharmacists are homosexuals. Font&#225;nez stated that co-workers would then call him (Font&#225;nez) gay or would ask him whether he was gay. Font&#225;nez admitted that these incidents occurred in 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1998, Font&#225;nez performed well and was promoted to the position of Quicksolv Project Leader, which gave him supervisory responsibility and a new supervisor, Quicksolv and Engineering Director Luis Guillermo P&#233;rez. Meanwhile, Natal had been transferred to the Packaging Department as Packaging Manager. In 1999, when the company closed its Quicksolv Department, Natal recommended Font&#225;nez for a newly created Packaging Manager position, and the company offered Font&#225;nez the position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Font&#225;nez's performance as Packaging Manager, however, only marginally met the company's expectations. Font&#225;nez lacked the ability to make prompt decisions and lacked certain basic administrative skills required for the position. During his tenure as Packaging Manager, deficiencies in his performance caused untimely product packaging, in turn resulting in unfulfilled product orders. Additionally, he failed to implement certain measures required for FDA compliance. Natal provided him some informal counseling in areas in which he needed to improve his job performance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Font&#225;nez asserts that Natal's harassment continued through February 2001, though he was not always Font&#225;nez's direct supervisor. Specifically, sometime in early 2001, Natal allegedly remarked in quite vulgar terms to Font&#225;nez that he (Natal) was looking for a homosexual to engage in sexual relations with him. Font&#225;nez complained that Natal would straighten the front of Natal's pants or touch his own buttocks in Font&#225;nez's presence and that Natal continued to use foul and vulgar language in the workplace. Font&#225;nez stated that these actions made him feel nervous, made him put forth a greater effort than others to gain acknowledgment, and made him feel he must speak succinctly at meetings or be told to shut up.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 2000, Font&#225;nez's then-supervisor, Aixa Berr&#237;os, Packaging and Materials Manager, met with Font&#225;nez to discuss several performance-related issues. She documented his performance deficiencies in writing and advised him that improved performance on his part was necessary to avoid further disciplinary action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 2001, the company eliminated Font&#225;nez's Packaging Manager position as part of its implementation of a plan known as the Lean Manufacturing Process. Rather than terminate Font&#225;nez, the company assigned him to the position of Senior Packaging Process Facilitator, with supervisory authority over approximately thirty-two employees. Berr&#237;os remained his supervisor. Due to several deficiencies in Font&#225;nez's job performance, Berr&#237;os concluded that Font&#225;nez was not performing the job at an acceptable level of competence. She recommended his termination in March 2001. Carlos Otero, Human Resources Director, reviewed that recommendation, and Jorge Ros, Plant Manager, made the ultimate decision to terminate Font&#225;nez on April 23, 2001. Natal was not involved in the termination decision and was no longer Font&#225;nez's supervisor at the time of his termination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At all relevant times, Janssen had well-established policies designed to prevent discriminatory conduct and sexual harassment in the workplace. These policies included a complaint mechanism for employees. Font&#225;nez received a copy of this policy. Although aware of the company's antidiscrimination policies and procedures, Font&#225;nez complained of harassing conduct to a supervisor only once. Font&#225;nez states that he told P&#233;rez of the harassing conduct in 1997. P&#233;rez did not play a role in the decision to terminate Font&#225;nez, and Font&#225;nez did not thereafter use Janssen's sexual harassment policies or its established complaint mechanism.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 2, 2001, Font&#225;nez filed a charge of discrimination with the Anti-Discrimination Unit of the Puerto Rico Department of Labor. Font&#225;nez then filed suit in federal court, alleging that he suffered a hostile work environment due to sexual harassment by his supervisor, Angel Natal, and that he was terminated on the basis of his gender and age in violation of Title VII, the ADEA, and Puerto Rico law. The district court granted the plaintiffs' request for voluntary dismissal of the Puerto Rico law claims and issued a partial summary judgment dismissing with prejudice the Title VII and ADEA claims against the individual defendants &#8212; Natal, Ros, Otero, and Berr&#237;os. Janssen sought summary judgment on the remaining claims. The district court granted Janssen's summary judgment motion, concluding that many of the acts complained of were time-barred, that Font&#225;nez had not established a prima facie case of age discrimination, and that there was no evidence of actionable sexual harassment or a hostile environment. Font&#225;nez appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"We review the grant of summary judgment <i>de novo,</i> based on the record as it stood before the district court.\" <i>Cordero-Soto,</i> 418 F.3d at 118.

Under this framework, to raise an inference of either age or gender discrimination sufficient to withstand summary judgment, it is necessary for a plaintiff to demonstrate, <i>inter alia,</i> that his or her job performance met the employer's legitimate expectations. <i>See, e.g., Hoffman v.

The facts of Janssen's statement of uncontested facts, however, are deemed admitted and may not now be controverted. The record demonstrates that Font&#225;nez held five different positions with Janssen, each with a higher salary than the last, but he did not perform well in the last two positions. Janssen appointed Font&#225;nez to the Process Facilitator position rather than fire him when his prior position was eliminated, Font&#225;nez was aware of the responsibilities of the job when he accepted the position, and Janssen terminated Font&#225;nez for unacceptable performance of those responsibilities in several respects. Accordingly, the district court properly granted summary judgment on Font&#225;nez's age and gender discrimination claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even putting aside the prima facie case, as we have often done, and turning \"instead, to whether there is evidence that, notwithstanding the employer's stated reasons for the termination, the real reason, at least in part, was age and gender discrimination,\" <i>Hillstrom v.

There is no evidence from which to conclude that the proffered reason for his termination was not in fact the real reason. Font&#225;nez has not presented evidence from which to conclude that Janssen's job expectations were illegitimate. Additionally, he has not presented any evidence to demonstrate that either age or gender discrimination was the real reason for the termination &#8212; or even a motivating influence in the decision. <i>See Hoffman,</i> 439 F.3d at 17-18 (citing <i>Reeves v.
