BATER,\n\n                      Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF MAINE\n\n           [Hon. D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Lynch, Chief Judge,\n\n                Boudin and Stahl, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Joseph Wrobleski, Jr., by appointment of the court, for\nappellant.\n     Renée M. Bunker, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nPaula D. Silsby, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         February 4, 2010\n\f           BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.         William Bater was convicted of\n\nbeing a felon in possession of a firearm, 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g)(1),\n\n924(e) (2000), and now appeals.             His arguments are that the\n\nindictment against him should have been dismissed due to prejudice\n\nfrom delay and that the firearm should itself have been suppressed\n\nas the product of an unlawful search.             We outline the history\n\nbriefly,     reserving   details   until    the   individual   claims    are\n\ndiscussed.\n\n           The rifle that prompted Bater's indictment was seized by\n\nMaine State Police on January 9, 2003, during a visit to Bater's\n\napartment in North Bridgton, Maine.          The police had visited the\n\napartment earlier in the day looking for Bater's nephew, Nicholas\n\nPhillips, whom the police were investigating for several burglaries\n\nand an arson.    On returning for a second visit, the police secured\n\nBater's consent to search the apartment for Phillips.          The search\n\nwas conducted by John Hainey, a detective with the Maine State\n\nPolice.\n\n           During the search, Hainey discovered under Bater's bed or\n\nmattress a large black case containing a hunting rifle.                 Bater\n\nclaims that Hainey had discovered the case while looking under the\n\nbed to see whether Phillips was secreted there and that he (Bater)\n\nhad denied Hainey permission to open the case. Hainey's version of\n\nevents was that he had seen two BB guns under the bed, had then\n\nasked Bater whether he had any firearms in the house, and that\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fBater had then voluntarily revealed the gun case, which had been\n\nhidden under the mattress.\n\n           Bater was not arrested but was asked for assistance, and\n\nhe in turn helped the police locate Phillips who was arrested that\n\nsame evening.      A week or two later, agents of the Bureau of\n\nAlcohol,     Tobacco,   Firearms,    and     Explosives    (\"ATF\")   began\n\ninvestigating Bater's firearm possession. In an interview with the\n\nATF in January 2003, Bater said that a woman named Sarah Otis\n\nbought the rifle for her father and later gave it to Bater's wife,\n\nChristina.    This conformed to what Bater told Hainey the day the\n\ngun was found, and to Christina Bater's testimony in subsequent\n\ncourt proceedings.\n\n           Within the month, the ATF confirmed that the gun had been\n\nsold to Otis and interviewed her.         Otis at first confirmed Bater's\n\nversion that she purchased the rifle for her father; later, she\n\nrecanted and instead explained she purchased the rifle for Bater at\n\nhis request--the position to which she testified at Bater's later\n\ntrial.   In April 2003, the ATF interviewed Phillips--who was then\n\nin jail in Maine--about the gun purchase because both Bater and\n\nOtis said that Phillips was present at the time.          According to the\n\nATF's notes, Phillips corroborated some aspects of Bater's story\n\nbut contradicted others.\n\n           During the interview, the agents told Phillips that they\n\nthought he was lying and emphasized that if he lied to the grand\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fjury he could be subject to federal charges; Phillips then declined\n\nto talk further with the agents, and Phillips later disappeared and\n\ndid not testify during any of the proceedings against Bater.    By\n\nMay 2003, the ATF had proof of multiple prior felony convictions\n\nfor Bater, and in June 2003, the ATF recommended to the U.S.\n\nAttorney, who had already opened a case file, that Bater be charged\n\nas being a felon in possession of a firearm.   Bater was indeed so\n\nindicted, but not until more than four years later, in September\n\n2007.\n\n          In October 2007, Bater moved to dismiss the indictment\n\nbecause of prejudicial delay in indicting him and also moved to\n\nsuppress the rifle as unlawfully seized.   Following an evidentiary\n\nhearing before a magistrate judge in January 2008, the district\n\ncourt adopted the magistrate judge's recommendation that both\n\nmotions be denied.   Bater was tried in May 2008 and convicted by\n\nthe jury, being later sentenced to 204 months in prison.    He now\n\nappeals, claiming that the district court erred in denying his\n\npretrial motions.\n\n          Bater first argues that the district court erred by not\n\ndismissing the indictment for impermissible delay due to the over\n\nfour-year gap between the finding of the firearm by the police\n\n(January 2003) and his indictment (September 2007).    We review a\n\ndistrict court's decision to not dismiss for pre-indictment delay\n\nfor abuse of discretion, United States v. DeCologero, 530 F.3d 36,\n\n\n                               -4-\n\f77 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 513, 129 S. Ct. 615 (2008),\n\nalthough the phrase is perhaps more misleading than helpful.1\n\n          Bater's   indictment   occurred   within   the   statute   of\n\nlimitations, which is five years for the offense charged, as well\n\nas most federal crimes, 18 U.S.C. § 3282(a); but even so, excessive\n\npre-indictment delay can sometimes, albeit rarely, violate the\n\nFifth Amendment's Due Process Clause if the defendant shows both\n\nthat the \"delay caused substantial prejudice to his right to a fair\n\ntrial\" and that \"the [g]overnment intentionally delayed indictment\n\n. . . to gain a tactical advantage.\"   United States v. Picciandra,\n\n788 F.2d 39, 42 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 847 (1986);\n\naccord DeCologero, 530 F.3d at 78.\n\n          Bater's claim of prejudice is that the delay in indicting\n\nhim caused Phillips to be unavailable to testify at trial and that\n\nhad Phillips been available, he would have supported Bater's claim\n\nthat the rifle had been purchased by Otis and given to Bater's wife\n\nas her own possession.   The first assertion rests on conjecture;\n\nthe second is debatable at best.   But even if both were true, the\n\nclaim would still fail because there is no evidence that the\n\n\n\n     1\n      Although suggesting great latitude, \"abuse of discretion\" has\nthis meaning only where the issue invites it--usually in applying\na general standard to specific facts (the test being essentially\none of reasonableness); but (confusingly) \"abuse of discretion\" is\nused as well to embrace mistakes on abstract issues of law\n(reviewed de novo) and errors of fact (for which clear error is the\ncustomary test). See Rogers Edwards, LLC v. Fiddes & Son Ltd., 427\nF.3d 129, 132 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                                 -5-\n\fgovernment delayed the indictment to deprive Bater of Phillips'\n\ntestimony and this alone defeats the due process claim.\n\n           The government says that its lawyers in the Maine U.S.\n\nAttorney's office were occupied with other matters, admitting that\n\nbetter track should have been kept of the case.    Obviously it is\n\nundesirable that indictment be delayed when all the evidence is in\n\nhand and no good reason for deferral exists; this is so for\n\nmultiple reasons too obvious to need recounting.   But the statute\n\nof limitations is the principal outer limit, United States v.\n\nLovasco, 431 U.S. 783, 789 (1977), and the due process claim under\n\nSupreme Court precedent is aimed only at deliberate misconduct by\n\nthe prosecutor (or at least something very close to that), id. at\n\n795 & n.17; United States v. Marion, 404 U.S. 307, 324 (1971).\n\n           Here, Bater has no proof whatever that the prosecutors'\n\ndelay was in any respect prompted by a wish to deprive Bater of\n\nPhillips' help, if help it were.       The government itself made\n\nefforts to find Phillips in 2006 to testify before the grand jury.\n\nBater complains that the police drove Phillips away by threatening\n\nhim with perjury, but this has no visible connection with the delay\n\nin indictment. Also, there is no indication that the police wanted\n\nhim to flee, and Hainey and another agent both said that he had not\n\nbeen considered a flight risk.    It is thus superfluous that the\n\npolice said that they customarily warn witnesses of the risk of\n\nperjury.\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f              Bater says that the prosecutors were at least reckless,\n\nitself    a    chameleon     term   sometimes   used    to       suggest    knowing\n\nindifference     to   risk    and   sometimes   merely       a    high     level   of\n\nnegligence.     United States v. Gonsalves, 435 F.3d 64, 70 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).     But nothing in the circumstances of this case suggests\n\nrecklessness even under the more broader conception of the term.\n\nAt best, the prosecutors had other more pressing cases (which is\n\nwhat they say), and at worst, the case merely slipped through the\n\ncracks.       If there is more, it was Bater's burden to show it.\n\nUnited States v. Stokes, 124 F.3d 39, 47 (1st Cir. 1997), cert.\n\ndenied, 522 U.S. 1139 (1998).\n\n              Although this is enough to dispose of the due process\n\nclaim, other required elements of such a claim are also lacking or\n\ndoubtful.      As to causation, it is unclear exactly when Phillips\n\nleft Maine or otherwise concealed himself.             Short of indicting and\n\ntrying Bater while Phillips was being held in jail--as he was when\n\ninterviewed in April 2003--his presence could hardly be guaranteed,\n\nand Bater provides no reason to think that indicting Bater sooner\n\nrather than later would have decreased the risk of Phillips'\n\nabsence.      See Stokes, 124 F.3d at 47.\n\n              Even assuming that Phillips had testified, it is not\n\nclear just what he would have said or how much it would have helped\n\nBater.    Based on the ATF's account of its interview with Phillips,\n\nBater claims that had Phillips testified, he would have confirmed\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fChristina Bater's testimony that Otis gave the rifle to Christina;\n\nbut Otis herself testified that she bought the rifle for Bater, and\n\nthe jury credited Otis rather than Christina, who had reason to\n\nprotect her husband.   One might doubt that support from Phillips,\n\nBater's nephew and himself a felon, would have made a difference.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Kenrick, 221 F.3d 19, 33 (1st Cir.),\n\ncert. denied 531 U.S. 961, 531 U.S. 1042 (2000); United States v.\n\nMcMutuary, 217 F.3d 477, 482 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 531 U.S.\n\n1001 (2000).\n\n          Bater's second line of argument on appeal is to challenge\n\nthe denial of his motion to suppress the rifle on grounds of a\n\nFourth Amendment violation.   In reviewing motions to suppress, we\n\nreview legal determinations de novo, but factual findings for clear\n\nerror, United States v. Melendez, 301 F.3d 27, 32 (1st Cir. 2002),\n\nand will uphold a lower court's denial of a motion to suppress so\n\nlong as \"any reasonable view of the evidence supports it,\" United\n\nStates v. Mendez-de Jesus, 85 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n          It is undisputed that Bater initially consented to a\n\nsearch only for Phillips, which at first limited the permissible\n\nscope of the search.   Florida v. Jimeno, 500 U.S. 248, 251 (1991).\n\nBut on Hainey's account, Bater when questioned admitted to having\n\na gun in the house and showed Hainey the gun case.    Bater simply\n\ndenies that this is what happened.    He does not claim, although\n\n\n\n\n                                -8-\n\fperhaps he might have, that tendering the case was not itself an\n\nimplied consent to Hainey to open it and secure the weapon.\n\n              Bater gave a quite different version of events, as\n\nalready recounted, but the magistrate judge and the district judge\n\ncredited Hainey.      Bater attacks this as clear error, but none of\n\nhis       arguments--and   he   makes     several--establish   that   the\n\nfactfinders' conclusion was clear error.2            Thus, we need not\n\nconsider the government's claim that Bater has no standing to\n\ncontest the seizure since he denies owning the gun or the district\n\ncourt's alternative ground of disposition that even on Bater's own\n\naccount, the plain view doctrine applied.\n\n              Finally, Bater argues the magistrate judge was biased\n\nagainst him, and so says the magistrate's opinion is entitled to\n\nless deference.       As evidence of bias, he points primarily to\n\ncomments the magistrate judge made about the efforts of Bater and\n\nhis attorney to track down Phillips.        But these comments were in a\n\nsingle footnote in the decision.          The entirety of the magistrate\n\njudge's report does not support Bater's claim of bias, and, anyway,\n\n\n\n\n      2\n      For example, Bater says that he would not have admitted\nowning a gun since he was a convicted felon; but once the question\nwas asked, he might well have thought discovery inevitable and\nsought the benefit of cooperation. Bater also says that if the gun\ncase were produced from under the mattress (as Hainey claimed),\nHainey would have noticed a lump in the bed, which he denied\nseeing; but this depends on the location and size of the lump,\nabout which we know nothing.\n\n                                    -9-\n\fthe final word was that of the district judge, who did not adopt\n\nthe footnote Bater challenges.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\f",

The government itself made\n\nefforts to find Phillips in 2006 to testify before the grand jury.\n\nBater complains that the police drove Phillips away by threatening\n\nhim with perjury, but this has no visible connection with the delay\n\nin indictment. Also, there is no indication that the police wanted\n\nhim to flee, and Hainey and another agent both said that he had not\n\nbeen considered a flight risk.    It is thus superfluous that the\n\npolice said that they customarily warn witnesses of the risk of\n\nperjury.\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f              Bater says that the prosecutors were at least reckless,\n\nitself    a    chameleon     term   sometimes   used    to       suggest    knowing\n\nindifference     to   risk    and   sometimes   merely       a    high     level   of\n\nnegligence.

But nothing in the circumstances of this case suggests\n\nrecklessness even under the more broader conception of the term.\n\nAt best, the prosecutors had other more pressing cases (which is\n\nwhat they say), and at worst, the case merely slipped through the\n\ncracks.       If there is more, it was Bater's burden to show it.\n\nUnited States v.

As to causation, it is unclear exactly when Phillips\n\nleft Maine or otherwise concealed himself.             Short of indicting and\n\ntrying Bater while Phillips was being held in jail--as he was when\n\ninterviewed in April 2003--his presence could hardly be guaranteed,\n\nand Bater provides no reason to think that indicting Bater sooner\n\nrather than later would have decreased the risk of Phillips'\n\nabsence.      See Stokes, 124 F.3d at 47.\n\n              Even assuming that Phillips had testified, it is not\n\nclear just what he would have said or how much it would have helped\n\nBater.    Based on the ATF's account of its interview with Phillips,\n\nBater claims that had Phillips testified, he would have confirmed\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fChristina Bater's testimony that Otis gave the rifle to Christina;\n\nbut Otis herself testified that she bought the rifle for Bater, and\n\nthe jury credited Otis rather than Christina, who had reason to\n\nprotect her husband.   One might doubt that support from Phillips,\n\nBater's nephew and himself a felon, would have made a difference.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v.

Florida v. Jimeno, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112595\"><a href=\"/opinion/112595/florida-v-jimeno/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">248</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 251 (1991).\n\nBut on Hainey's account, Bater when questioned admitted to having\n\na gun in the house and showed Hainey the gun case.    Bater simply\n\ndenies that this is what happened.    He does not claim, although\n\n\n\n\n                                -8-\n\fperhaps he might have, that tendering the case was not itself an\n\nimplied consent to Hainey to open it and secure the weapon.\n\n              Bater gave a quite different version of events, as\n\nalready recounted, but the magistrate judge and the district judge\n\ncredited Hainey.      Bater attacks this as clear error, but none of\n\nhis       arguments--and   he   makes     several--establish   that   the\n\nfactfinders' conclusion was clear error.2            Thus, we need not\n\nconsider the government's claim that Bater has no standing to\n\ncontest the seizure since he denies owning the gun or the district\n\ncourt's alternative ground of disposition that even on Bater's own\n\naccount, the plain view doctrine applied.\n\n              Finally, Bater argues the magistrate judge was biased\n\nagainst him, and so says the magistrate's opinion is entitled to\n\nless deference.       As evidence of bias, he points primarily to\n\ncomments the magistrate judge made about the efforts of Bater and\n\nhis attorney to track down Phillips.        But these comments were in a\n\nsingle footnote in the decision.          The entirety of the magistrate\n\njudge's report does not support Bater's claim of bias, and, anyway,\n\n\n\n\n      2\n      For example, Bater says that he would not have admitted\nowning a gun since he was a convicted felon; but once the question\nwas asked, he might well have thought discovery inevitable and\nsought the benefit of cooperation. Bater also says that if the gun\ncase were produced from under the mattress (as Hainey claimed),\nHainey would have noticed a lump in the bed, which he denied\nseeing; but this depends on the location and size of the lump,\nabout which we know nothing.\n\n                                    -9-\n\fthe final word was that of the district judge, who did not adopt\n\nthe footnote Bater challenges.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\f</pre>",
