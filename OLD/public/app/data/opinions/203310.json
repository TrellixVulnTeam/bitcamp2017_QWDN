CRUZADO-LAUREANO,\n\n                         Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                 FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n         [Hon. José Antonio Fusté,       U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                      Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                 Baldock,* Senior Circuit Judge,\n                     and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Alexander Zeno for appellant.\n     Thomas F. Klumper, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nRosa Emilia Rodriguez-Velez, United States Attorney, and Nelson\nPérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n                             June 4, 2008\n\n\n_______________________\n\n     * Of the    Tenth    Circuit    Court   of   Appeals,   sitting   by\ndesignation.\n\f            LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.      In two prior appeals to this\n\ncourt,   appellant    Juan   Manuel    Cruzado-Laureano   (\"Cruzado\")\n\nsuccessfully raised claims that required remand to the district\n\ncourt for recalculation of his sentence.         A third sentencing\n\nhearing was held in April 2006, nearly four years after Cruzado was\n\nconvicted on corruption-related charges.      He now attempts a new\n\nround of challenges to his sixty-three month term of imprisonment\n\nand the related imposition of restitution and a fine.     Finding no\n\nmerit in any of these claims, we affirm all aspects of his\n\nsentence.\n\n                                 I.\n\n            The factual background of appellant's crimes was fully\n\ndetailed in our two prior opinions.     See United States v. Cruzado-\n\nLaureano, 440 F.3d 44, 45 (1st Cir. 2006) (\"Cruzado II\"); United\n\nStates v. Cruzado-Laureano, 404 F.3d 470, 473-79 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(\"Cruzado I\").    It suffices to say here that Cruzado, the former\n\nmayor of Vega Alta, Puerto Rico, was convicted by a jury in June\n\n2002 on charges of embezzlement, extortion, money laundering and\n\nwitness tampering stemming from conduct undertaken while he was in\n\noffice, including demanding kickbacks on municipal contracts.     The\n\ndistrict court imposed a 63-month term of imprisonment and a\n\n$10,000 fine, and subsequently ordered Cruzado to pay restitution\n\nin the amount of $14,251.82.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\f          In his first appeal, we rejected various challenges to\n\nhis conviction, but remanded for resentencing because the district\n\ncourt had applied the wrong version of the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nAfter a new calculation on remand, the court again imposed a 63-\n\nmonth term, which was the bottom of the new Guidelines range of 63-\n\n78 months, and reinstated the same fine and restitution amounts.\n\nSee Cruzado II, 440 F.3d at 47.        Cruzado filed a second appeal\n\nchallenging the district court's application of several Guidelines\n\nprovisions. We detected a single flaw – that the court erroneously\n\nhad applied an enhancement for abuse of a position of public trust\n\nunder U.S.S.G. § 3B1.3.   Id. at 48-49.   We therefore again remanded\n\nfor resentencing, noting that \"we do not intend to intimate that\n\nthe length of the sentence should necessarily be changed.\"    Id. at\n\n50.   We also stated that Cruzado's challenges to the district\n\ncourt's imposition of restitution, a fine and supervised release\n\nwere \"too perfunctory . . . to permit us to evaluate the merits of\n\nthose aspects of his punishment,\" citing our well established\n\nprecedent that issues \"'unaccompanied by some effort at developed\n\nargumentation[] are deemed waived,'\" Id. at 47 n.7 (quoting United\n\nStates v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990)).\n\n          A third sentencing hearing was held on April 26, 2006.\n\nCruzado and the government agreed on the criminal history category\n\n(I) and the total base offense level (24), which resulted in a\n\nGuidelines range of 51 to 63 months of imprisonment.         Cruzado\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fargued at the hearing that the district court could reconsider all\n\naspects of his sentence, including restitution, because the appeals\n\ncourt had not explicitly limited the remand to a reassessment of\n\nthe   correct   term     of     imprisonment         without    the   abuse-of-trust\n\nenhancement.      He also sought to present witnesses to prove that he\n\nwas \"actually innocent,\" that he had been subject to malicious\n\nprosecution, and that there were no victims of his crime – and\n\nhence no need for restitution – because no loss had occurred.                       The\n\ndistrict   court       determined      that     it    could     consider     only   the\n\nappropriate sentence within the applicable Guidelines range.                         It\n\nagreed, however, to hear character testimony from four witnesses,\n\nand it allowed Cruzado to submit the questions his counsel had\n\nplanned to ask of those witnesses and the five additional witnesses\n\nhe had wanted to call.        At the conclusion of the hearing, the court\n\nagain   imposed    a    63-month    term      and     also     re-imposed    the    same\n\nrestitution ($14,251.82) and fine ($10,000).\n\n           Cruzado has once again appealed his sentence, raising\n\nfive claims of error: (1) the district court improperly refused to\n\nconduct a de novo hearing; (2) even if a full de novo resentencing\n\nwas   barred,   the     court    should    have      made     new   findings   on   the\n\nrestitution and fine amounts because they are integral elements of\n\nevery sentence; (3) the court impermissibly double-counted his lack\n\nof acceptance of responsibility; (4) appellant should have been\n\nallowed    to   present       victim    testimony        in     mitigation     of   his\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fpunishment; and (5) bias on the part of the sentencing judge denied\n\nappellant due process, requiring resentencing before a different\n\njudge.    We briefly explain why each of these contentions fails.1\n\n                                     II.\n\nA. Scope of Remand/Restitution and Fine\n\n            Appellant   argues    that   the   district       court   improperly\n\nlimited the scope of his latest sentencing hearing to a decision on\n\nthe   appropriate   term   of    imprisonment       within    the   recalculated\n\nGuidelines range, which was corrected from 63-78 months to 51-63\n\nmonths.   Cruzado asserts that resentencings after remand should be\n\nconducted as de novo proceedings and that his entire sentence –\n\nincluding   the   amount   of    restitution    –    was     therefore   open   to\n\nreconsideration. Although some circuits do generally allow de novo\n\nresentencing on remand, see, e.g., United States v. Duso, 42 F.3d\n\n365, 368 (6th Cir. 1994); United States v. Smith, 930 F.2d 1450,\n\n\n\n\n      1\n       Although Cruzado has completed serving his term of\nimprisonment, this appeal has not become moot because of his\nchallenges to the amounts of restitution and fine. See Spencer v.\nKemna, 523 U.S. 1, 7 (1998) (holding that appeal of a conviction is\nrendered moot upon expiration of sentence unless defendant alleges\nsome continuing \"'collateral consequence'\"); United States v.\nMolak, 276 F.3d 45, 48-49 (1st Cir. 2002) (noting that restitution\norder provides a pecuniary interest in the outcome of the appeal,\navoiding mootness). In addition, if Cruzado were to succeed with\na claim that his sentence was improperly calculated, his three-year\nperiod of supervised release could be reduced on remand.       See,\ne.g., United States v. Verdin, 243 F.3d 1174, 1178 (9th Cir. 2001)\n(finding that defendant's sentencing appeal was not moot because,\n\"[i]f he were to prevail . . . he could be resentenced to a shorter\nperiod of supervised release\").\n\n                                     -5-\n\f1456 (10th Cir. 1991), the First Circuit does not.             In United\n\nStates v. Ticchiarelli, 171 F.3d 24 (1st Cir. 1999), we held:\n\n          \"[U]pon a resentencing occasioned by a remand,\n          unless the court of appeals [has expressly\n          directed otherwise], the district court may\n          consider only such new arguments or new facts\n          as are made newly relevant by the court of\n          appeals' decision – whether by the reasoning\n          or by the result.\"\n\nId. at 32 (quoting United States v. Whren, 111 F.3d 956, 960 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1997)).\n\n          Appellant acknowledges this precedent, which gives the\n\npanel remanding the case for resentencing the responsibility for\n\naltering the normal scope of the new sentencing hearing. Hence, he\n\nappears to concede that the issue of de novo resentencing is not,\n\nas a general principle, properly before us.       See Naser Jewelers,\n\nInc. v. Concord, 513 F.3d 27, 36 (1st Cir. 2007) (noting that a\n\nsubsequent panel lacks power to overrule the decision of an earlier\n\npanel).   The issue is raised, he explains, to preserve it for en\n\nbanc and Supreme Court review.\n\n          However,   as   a   separate   challenge,   he   contends   that\n\nrestitution and a fine are such \"integral\" parts of a sentence\n\nthat, even in a remand limited to correcting the abuse-of-trust\n\nerror, they are within the exception carved out in Ticchiarelli for\n\nmatters \"'made newly relevant by the court of appeals' decision.'\"\n\n171 F.3d at 32.      In effect, he argues that whenever a court\n\n\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fresentences a defendant, it must reconsider any related restitution\n\nand fine.\n\n            This attempt to avoid the holding in Ticchiarelli is\n\nunavailing in this case.     Cruzado contested restitution at his\n\nsecond sentencing hearing and challenged both restitution and the\n\nfine in his prior appeal.   However, as noted above, we deemed those\n\nchallenges waived because the claims were inadequately developed.\n\nThe need to correct the abuse-of-trust error has not given new\n\nmerit to his opposition to those assessments.    In this appeal, he\n\nargues that restitution was improper because no victim had a loss\n\nand that the fine was improper because he had no resources to pay\n\nit. These assertions are unrelated to the abuse-of-trust issue and\n\nhad no relationship to the issue before the court on remand – the\n\nappropriate length of the sentence under the Guidelines.       See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Elizondo, 475 F.3d 692, 697 (5th Cir. 2007)\n\n(holding that a remand for resentencing in light of United States\n\nv. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005), did not re-open the issue of\n\nrestitution).\n\n            Cruzado also suggests that, given the lower base offense\n\nlevel resulting from his second appeal, the district court should\n\nhave considered imposing lower amounts of restitution and fine.\n\nHowever, defense counsel acknowledged at the sentencing hearing\n\nthat the fine imposed, $10,000, was the lowest point of a range\n\nthat went up to $500,000.      The restitution order was based on\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fspecific findings of loss and not on Guidelines sentencing ranges.\n\nBecause neither the amount of restitution nor the size of the fine\n\nwas \"'made newly relevant by the court of appeals' decision,'\"\n\nappellant is not entitled to another opportunity to assert these\n\nclaims.      Ticchiarelli, 171 F.3d at 32 (quoting Whren, 111 F.3d at\n\n960).\n\n             The district court therefore properly limited the scope\n\nof     the   latest   sentencing     hearing      to    consideration         of   the\n\nappropriate sentence within the applicable Guidelines range, and\n\nour review is likewise restricted to issues related to appellant's\n\nterm of imprisonment.\n\nB. Double Counting of Failure to Express Remorse\n\n             Appellant    argues   that     the   district      court    improperly\n\nconsidered his lack of remorse in deciding to re-impose a 63-month\n\nterm    of   imprisonment,   which    had    become     the    high     end   of   the\n\napplicable      Guidelines   range    after       the   court    eliminated        the\n\nerroneous     two-level   enhancement       for   abuse   of    trust.        At   his\n\nprevious sentencing, 63 months was the low end of the applicable\n\nrange.       Appellant contends that using his lack of remorse to\n\njustify a high-end sentence amounted to impermissible double-\n\ncounting because his refusal to admit guilt already was taken into\n\naccount when he did not receive a decrease in offense level for\n\nacceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\f            This contention also is foreclosed by First Circuit\n\nprecedent.    In United States v. Paz Uribe, 891 F.2d 396, 400 (1st\n\nCir. 1989), we rejected the appellant's claim that the district\n\ncourt   erred    by     twice       considering     his     failure      to   accept\n\nresponsibility.       The appellant had argued that improper double\n\ncounting     occurred       when   the   court    considered       his   denial     of\n\nresponsibility in sentencing him at the top of the applicable\n\nGuidelines range given that the range had been \"premised on there\n\nbeing no acceptance of responsibility.\"               Id.        We noted that the\n\ndistrict    court     has    discretion    to     tailor    a    sentence     to   the\n\nindividual defendant and the circumstances of his offense, and\n\nconcluded     that,     \"in        the   absence     of     an     acceptance       of\n\nresponsibility,\" the court properly selected the high end of the\n\nGuidelines range \"[d]ue to the substantial amount of cocaine\n\ninvolved.\"    Id.\n\n            We thus recognized in Paz Uribe that lack of remorse may\n\npermissibly serve two different functions under the Guidelines: to\n\ndisqualify a defendant from receiving a reduction in offense level\n\nfor acceptance of responsibility and as a factor in determining the\n\ndefendant's particular sentence within the Guidelines range.                       The\n\ndistrict court's ruling here also properly reflected that dual\n\nrole.   In explaining its choice of a sentence, the district court\n\ndescribed appellant's offense as \"serious\" and \"egregious,\" noted\n\nthat his unlawful activity began \"not even a year\" after he had\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\ftaken office as mayor, and pointed to his attempt to tamper with\n\nthree potential witnesses during the investigation. The court also\n\nobserved that, despite opportunities for appellant to express\n\nremorse, \"sadly, he has failed to do so.\"     The court concluded its\n\nreview of the circumstances as follows:\n\n            So where should I sentence the defendant under\n            these circumstances?    I do think if we are\n            going to consider the seriousness of what\n            happened in this case and we are going to\n            consider the state of affairs in this case as\n            of today, the only thing to do, the only\n            proper thing to do would be to sentence him at\n            the same level we sentenced him before, which\n            is the 63 months.\n\nIn other words, the court did not \"increase\" his sentence based on\n\nlack of remorse, but instead chose the sentence from within the\n\nrecommended range that it deemed most suited to the defendant and\n\nhis conduct.\n\n            The court's consideration of appellant's attitude toward\n\nthe crime, as well as the serious nature of the offense, was\n\nappropriate under both the Guidelines and 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), the\n\nstatutory   provision   governing   the   imposition   of   a   sentence.\n\nGuidelines § 1B1.4 provides:\n\n            In determining the sentence to impose within\n            the guideline range, or whether a departure\n            from the guidelines is warranted, the court\n            may   consider,    without   limitation,   any\n            information    concerning   the    background,\n            character and conduct of the defendant, unless\n\n\n\n\n                                -10-\n\f               otherwise prohibited by law. See 18 U.S.C. §\n               3661.2\n\nSection 3553 states that, \"in determining the particular sentence\n\nto   be      imposed,\"     the    court     shall   consider      \"the     nature   and\n\ncircumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of\n\nthe defendant.\"        18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(1).           The statute also directs\n\nthe court to consider, inter alia, \"the need for the sentence\n\nimposed . . . to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote\n\nrespect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the\n\noffense,\" id. § 3553(a)(2)(A), and the need \"to protect the public\n\nfrom       further   crimes      of   the   defendant,\"    id.    §    3553(a)(2)(C).\n\nAppellant's refusal to acknowledge that he committed criminal acts\n\nis   information      that    falls     well   within     both    of   these     guiding\n\nprovisions, giving relevant insight into his character and raising\n\nconcerns about his respect for the law and his future conduct.\n\n               Appellant argues that, despite its seeming relevance, his\n\nlack of remorse is \"prohibited by law\" from being considered, see\n\nU.S.S.G.      §   1B1.4,    because     reliance    on    his    refusal    to   accept\n\nresponsibility violates his constitutional right to maintain his\n\ninnocence.        We explicitly have rejected an equivalent argument –\n\nthat the Guidelines provision allowing a reduction for acceptance\n\n\n\n       2\n      Section 3661 provides: \"No limitation shall be placed on the\ninformation concerning the background, character, and conduct of a\nperson convicted of an offense which a court of the United States\nmay receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an appropriate\nsentence.\"\n\n                                            -11-\n\fof responsibility places the defendant \"in the unconstitutional\n\ndilemma of abandoning his right not to incriminate himself or\n\nrisking a higher sentence.\"             Paz Uribe, 891 F.2d at 400; see also\n\nUnited States v. De Jongh, 937 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1991).                     The\n\nconstitutional argument is no more persuasive here.                 \"[N]ot every\n\nburden on a right or encouragement to waive a right is invalid,\"\n\nPaz Uribe, 891 F.2d at 400, and it is well established that lack of\n\nremorse is a proper consideration in sentencing, United States v.\n\nJohnson, 903 F.2d 1084, 1090 (7th Cir. 1990) (citing cases).                  See\n\nalso United States v. Jahagirdar, 466 F.3d 149, 157 (1st Cir. 2006)\n\n(noting district court's reliance on lack of remorse, among other\n\nfactors, in upholding sentence as reasonable); United States v.\n\nThompson, 476 F.2d 1196, 1091 (7th Cir. 1973) (\"A show of lenience\n\nto those who exhibit contrition by admitting guilt does not carry\n\na corollary that the Judge indulges a policy of penalizing those\n\nwho elect to stand trial.\").\n\n                Accordingly, we find no error in the court's reliance on\n\nlack       of   remorse   among   the   factors   it   considered    in   setting\n\nappellant's sentence at the high end of the applicable Guidelines\n\nrange.3\n\n\n       3\n      We note that the district court originally imposed a 63-month\nterm of imprisonment at the first of appellant's three sentencing\nproceedings.    At that time, the term was at the top of the\nGuidelines range the district thought applicable. At appellant's\ninitial resentencing hearing, the government recommended that, even\nthough 63 months was the low end of the correct range, the court\n\"in all fairness, should go ahead and give him the minimum range of\n\n                                         -12-\n\fC. Mitigation Testimony\n\n          Appellant   argues   that    the   district   court    erred   in\n\nrestricting his presentation of testimony in mitigation of his\n\npunishment. He sought to present nine witnesses on various issues,\n\nincluding his innocence and the amount of restitution.          Consistent\n\nwith its ruling that the single issue before it was the appropriate\n\nterm of imprisonment, the court allowed testimony only about\n\nappellant's character.4   Defendant called four witnesses, only two\n\nof whom turned out to know him personally.         They testified that\n\nappellant was \"a good citizen,\" that he was \"very devoted to the\n\nmunicipality,\" that he was, in general, \"a good person,\" and, \"if\n\nhe made any mistakes or infractions, perhaps it was lack of\n\norientation.\" In addition, his attorney submitted the questions he\n\n\nthis guideline which is 63 months.\"    The prosecutor observed that\nit would be unfair to impose a higher sentence as a result of his\nsuccessful appeal. The court accepted that recommendation, stating\nthat \"it would be a material injustice to a defendant who has done\nnothing other than to exercise his constitutional right to an\nappeal and trial, . . . to punish him for the fact that he ended up\nwith a higher guideline.\" Thus, the record shows that the court\nhas never viewed appellant as deserving a sentence at the low end\nof the applicable Guidelines range, having imposed a low-end\nsentence in the second sentencing hearing as a matter of fairness.\nThus, the court's latest determination that the appropriate\nsentence is 63 months – which once again falls at the high end of\nthe applicable range – does not indicate either a new or improper\nescalation in the court's perception of appellant's culpability or\nthe appropriate penalty.\n     4\n       Appellant argues that the amount of loss suffered by the\nvictims was relevant to the determination of his sentence, as well\nas to restitution. However, testimony about loss at the sentencing\nhearing was unnecessary given that the court already had made a\nfinding on loss in connection with the restitution order.\n\n                                -13-\n\fhad wanted to ask all nine witnesses as well as the outline of the\n\nargument he intended to make if he had been allowed to fully\n\nquestion the proposed witnesses.   The court thus had ample insight\n\ninto defendant's concerns.   Cruzado also gave a lengthy allocution\n\nin which he asserted that the case against him was fabricated by\n\nthe government. In support of his statement, the court allowed him\n\nto submit an audit report from the municipality.\n\n          In claiming that the court's limitations on witness\n\ntestimony violated his right to allocution under Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n32, appellant primarily relies on inapposite case law concerning\n\nthe rights of defendants in death penalty cases.   Federal Rule of\n\nCivil Procedure 32 does not give defendants the right to call\n\nwitnesses in their behalf at sentencing.    The rule only requires\n\nthe court to allow the defendant and his attorney to speak.    Fed.\n\nR. Crim. P. 32(i)(4)(A)(i), (ii);5 see United States v. Rodriguez,\n\n336 F.3d 67, 70 (1st Cir. 2003) (\"It is a familiar rule that a\n\ncriminal defendant, about to be sentenced, is not entitled to an\n\nevidentiary hearing on demand.\"); United States v. Heller, 797 F.2d\n\n\n\n     5\n      Rule 32(i)(4) states, in relevant part:\n     (A) By a Party.     Before imposing sentence, the court\n     must:\n           (i) provide the defendant's attorney an\n           opportunity to speak on the defendant's\n           behalf;\n           (ii) address the defendant personally in order\n           to permit the defendant to speak or present\n           any information to mitigate the sentence\n           . . . .\n\n                               -14-\n\f41, 43 (1st Cir. 1986) (\"Although the defendant must be given the\n\nchance to inform the court of any mitigating circumstances, he does\n\nnot   have    the   right     to   have   others      testify      for    him   at    a\n\nsentencing.\"). In the context of this case, the district court was\n\nmore than generous in giving appellant an opportunity to comment on\n\nthe   appropriate     sentence     through        witness    testimony,      his     own\n\nstatement, counsel's argument, and the supporting documents.                         He\n\nwas entitled to no more.\n\nD.    Judicial Bias\n\n             Appellant claims that he was denied due process at his\n\nresentencing hearing because the district judge was biased against\n\nhim and should have disqualified himself.                    In support of this\n\nclaim, appellant primarily relies on the district court's refusal\n\nto grant him bail pending the resentencing hearing, which was\n\nscheduled to occur after appellant already had been incarcerated\n\nfor   more   than   51   months    –   the    low    point    of   the     applicable\n\nGuidelines range. Appellant asserts that the denial of bail \"could\n\nmean only one thing – [the judge] already knew that he would impose\n\na sentence above the time already served.                   Hence he was clearly\n\nbiased.\"     Appellant also cites the district court's rulings on the\n\nscope of the appeal, the presentation of mitigation evidence, and\n\nthe appropriateness of considering his lack of acceptance of\n\nresponsibility.          In   addition,      he    refers    in    a     footnote    to\n\ndisciplinary proceedings against his counsel that were processed by\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\fthe district judge in this case in his role as Chief Judge of the\n\nDistrict, but that were initiated by two other judges.\n\n          These complaints do not remotely establish a due process\n\nviolation.   Recusal is required only when a judge's \"impartiality\n\nmight reasonably be questioned,\" 28 U.S.C. § 455(a), and judges\n\nshould not \"recuse themselves lightly,\" United States v. Snyder,\n\n235 F.3d 42, 45 (1st Cir. 2000).       See also id. at 46 (\"[A] judge\n\nhas a duty to recuse himself if his impartiality can reasonably be\n\nquestioned; but otherwise, he has a duty to sit.\").       The court's\n\ndenial of bail pending the hearing is an insufficient indicator of\n\nbias, given that the sentencing range went up to 63 months and a\n\nhigher non-Guidelines sentence could have been imposed.     The court\n\nwas familiar with the case, having presided over the trial and\n\ntwice previously sentenced appellant; it reasonably could have\n\nanticipated that appellant's new sentence would not be at the\n\nbottom of the range.   See In re United States, 441 F.3d 44, 67 (1st\n\nCir. 2006) (noting \"the principle that a judge's rulings and\n\nstatements in the course of proceedings before him or her rarely\n\nprovide a basis for recusal under § 455(a)\").\n\n          Moreover, the court did not ignore the timing issue.     It\n\nordered appellant's expedited transfer to Puerto Rico so that the\n\nhearing could take place as soon as possible.        In addition, as\n\ndescribed above, the judge did not have a closed mind about the\n\nterm of imprisonment and stated that he would have considered a\n\n\n                                -16-\n\flower sentence if appellant had expressed remorse.    Finally, the\n\nfact that disciplinary complaints were filed by other judges\n\nagainst defense counsel is insufficient to taint a sentencing\n\nhearing that was, as we have discussed, properly conducted.    Cf.\n\nUnited States v. Mendoza, 468 F.3d 1256, 1262 (10th Cir. 2006)\n\n(holding that judge's own referral of counsel for disciplinary\n\nreview was not a basis for questioning judge's impartiality); In re\n\nCooper, 821 F.2d 833, 838 (1st Cir. 1987) (per curiam) (\"Generally,\n\nclashes between court and counsel are an insufficient basis for\n\ndisqualification . . . .\").      We therefore reject appellant's\n\ncontention that judicial bias caused a denial of his due process\n\nrights.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -17-\n\f",

A third sentencing hearing was held in April 2006, nearly four years after Cruzado was convicted on corruption-related charges. He now attempts a new round of challenges to his sixty-three month term of imprisonment and the related imposition of restitution and a fine. Finding no merit in any of these claims, we affirm all aspects of his sentence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>The factual background of appellant's crimes was fully detailed in our two prior opinions. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Cruzado-Laureano,</i> 440 F.3d 44, 45 (1st Cir.2006) (\"<i>Cruzado II</i>\"); <i>United States v. Cruzado-Laureano,</i> 404 F.3d 470, 473-79 (1st Cir.2005) (\"<i>Cruzado I</i>\"). It suffices to say here that Cruzado, the former mayor of Vega Alta, Puerto Rico, was convicted by a jury in June 2002 on charges of embezzlement, extortion, money laundering and witness tampering stemming from conduct undertaken while he was in office, including demanding kickbacks on municipal contracts. The district court imposed a 63-month term of imprisonment and a $10,000 fine, and subsequently ordered Cruzado to pay restitution in the amount of $14,251.82.</p>\n<p>In his first appeal, we rejected various challenges to his conviction, but remanded for resentencing because the district court had applied the wrong version of the Sentencing Guidelines. After a new calculation on remand, the court again imposed a 63-month term, which was the bottom of the new Guidelines range of 63-78 months, and reinstated the same fine and restitution amounts. <i>See </i><i>Cruzado II,</i> 440 F.3d at 47. Cruzado filed a second appeal challenging the district court's application of several Guidelines provisions. We detected a single flaw  that the court erroneously had applied an enhancement for abuse of a position of public trust under U.S.S.G. § 3B1.3. <i>Id.</i> at 48-49. We therefore again remanded for resentencing, noting that \"we do not intend to intimate that the length of the sentence should necessarily be changed.\" <i>Id.</i> at 50. We also stated that Cruzado's challenges to the district court's imposition of restitution, a fine and supervised release were \"too perfunctory... to permit us to evaluate the merits of those aspects of his punishment,\" citing our well established precedent that issues \"`unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation[ ] are deemed waived,'\" <i>Id.</i> at 47 n. 7 (quoting <i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990)).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*234</span> A third sentencing hearing was held on April 26, 2006. Cruzado and the government agreed on the criminal history category (I) and the total base offense level (24), which resulted in a Guidelines range of 51 to 63 months of imprisonment. Cruzado argued at the hearing that the district court could reconsider all aspects of his sentence, including restitution, because the appeals court had not explicitly limited the remand to a reassessment of the correct term of imprisonment without the abuse-of-trust enhancement. He also sought to present witnesses to prove that he was \"actually innocent,\" that he had been subject to malicious prosecution, and that there were no victims of his crime  and hence no need for restitution  because no loss had occurred. The district court determined that it could consider only the appropriate sentence within the applicable Guidelines range. It agreed, however, to hear character testimony from four witnesses, and it allowed Cruzado to submit the questions his counsel had planned to ask of those witnesses and the five additional witnesses he had wanted to call. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court again imposed a 63-month term and also re-imposed the same restitution ($14,251.82) and fine ($10,000).</p>\n<p>Cruzado has once again appealed his sentence, raising five claims of error: (1) the district court improperly refused to conduct a de novo hearing; (2) even if a full de novo resentencing was barred, the court should have made new findings on the restitution and fine amounts because they are integral elements of every sentence; (3) the court impermissibly double-counted his lack of acceptance of responsibility; (4) appellant should have been allowed to present victim testimony in mitigation of his punishment; and (5) bias on the part of the sentencing judge denied appellant due process, requiring resentencing before a different judge. We briefly explain why each of these contentions fails.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Scope of Remand/Restitution and Fine</h2>\n<p>Appellant argues that the district court improperly limited the scope of his latest sentencing hearing to a decision on the appropriate term of imprisonment within the recalculated Guidelines range, which was corrected from 63-78 months to 51-63 months. Cruzado asserts that resentencings after remand should be conducted as de novo proceedings and that his entire sentence  including the amount of restitution  was therefore open to reconsideration. Although some circuits do generally allow de novo resentencing on remand, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Duso,</i> 42 F.3d 365, 368 (6th Cir.1994); <i>United States v. Smith,</i> 930 F.2d 1450, 1456 (10th Cir. 1991), the First Circuit does not. In <i>United States v. Ticchiarelli,</i> 171 F.3d 24 (1st Cir.1999), we held:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*235</span> \"[U]pon a resentencing occasioned by a remand, unless the court of appeals [has expressly directed otherwise], the district court may consider only such new arguments or new facts as are made newly relevant by the court of appeals' decision  whether by the reasoning or by the result.\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 32 (quoting <i>United States v. Whren,</i> 111 F.3d 956, 960 (D.C.Cir.1997)).</p>\n<p>Appellant acknowledges this precedent, which gives the panel remanding the case for resentencing the responsibility for altering the normal scope of the new sentencing hearing. Hence, he appears to concede that the issue of de novo resentencing is not, as a general principle, properly before us. <i>See </i><i>Naser Jewelers, Inc. v. Concord,</i> 513 F.3d 27, 36 (1st Cir.2008) (noting that a subsequent panel lacks power to overrule the decision of an earlier panel). The issue is raised, he explains, to preserve it for en banc and Supreme Court review.</p>\n<p>However, as a separate challenge, he contends that restitution and a fine are such \"integral\" parts of a sentence that, even in a remand limited to correcting the abuse-of-trust error, they are within the exception carved out in <i>Ticchiarelli</i> for matters \"`made newly relevant by the court of appeals' decision.'\" 171 F.3d at 32. In effect, he argues that whenever a court resentences a defendant, it must reconsider any related restitution and fine.</p>\n<p>This attempt to avoid the holding in <i>Ticchiarelli</i> is unavailing in this case. Cruzado contested restitution at his second sentencing hearing and challenged both restitution and the fine in his prior appeal. However, as noted above, we deemed those challenges waived because the claims were inadequately developed. The need to correct the abuse-of-trust error has not given new merit to his opposition to those assessments. In this appeal, he argues that restitution was improper because no victim had a loss and that the fine was improper because he had no resources to pay it. These assertions are unrelated to the abuse-of-trust issue and had no relationship to the issue before the court on remand  the appropriate length of the sentence under the Guidelines. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Elizondo,</i> 475 F.3d 692, 697 (5th Cir.2007) (holding that a remand for resentencing in light of <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), did not re-open the issue of restitution).</p>\n<p>Cruzado also suggests that, given the lower base offense level resulting from his second appeal, the district court should have considered imposing lower amounts of restitution and fine. However, defense counsel acknowledged at the sentencing hearing that the fine imposed, $10,000, was the lowest point of a range that went up to $500,000. The restitution order was based on specific findings of loss and not on Guidelines sentencing ranges. Because neither the amount of restitution nor the size of the fine was \"`made newly relevant by the court of appeals' decision,'\" appellant is not entitled to another opportunity to assert these claims. <i>Ticchiarelli,</i> 171 F.3d at 32 (quoting <i>Whren,</i> 111 F.3d at 960).</p>\n<p>The district court therefore properly limited the scope of the latest sentencing hearing to consideration of the appropriate sentence within the applicable Guidelines range, and our review is likewise restricted to issues related to appellant's term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Double Counting of Failure to Express Remorse</h2>\n<p>Appellant argues that the district court improperly considered his lack of remorse in deciding to re-impose a 63-month term of imprisonment, which had <span class=\"star-pagination\">*236</span> become the high end of the applicable Guidelines range after the court eliminated the erroneous two-level enhancement for abuse of trust. At his previous sentencing, 63 months was the low end of the applicable range. Appellant contends that using his lack of remorse to justify a high-end sentence amounted to impermissible double-counting because his refusal to admit guilt already was taken into account when he did not receive a decrease in offense level for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1.</p>\n<p>This contention also is foreclosed by First Circuit precedent. In <i>United States v. Paz Uribe,</i> 891 F.2d 396, 400 (1st Cir. 1989), we rejected the appellant's claim that the district court erred by twice considering his failure to accept responsibility. The appellant had argued that improper double counting occurred when the court considered his denial of responsibility in sentencing him at the top of the applicable Guidelines range given that the range had been \"premised on there being no acceptance of responsibility.\" <i>Id.</i> We noted that the district court has discretion to tailor a sentence to the individual defendant and the circumstances of his offense, and concluded that, \"in the absence of an acceptance of responsibility,\" the court properly selected the high end of the Guidelines range \"[d]ue to the substantial amount of cocaine involved.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>We thus recognized in <i>Paz Uribe</i> that lack of remorse may permissibly serve two different functions under the Guidelines: to disqualify a defendant from receiving a reduction in offense level for acceptance of responsibility and as a factor in determining the defendant's particular sentence within the Guidelines range. The district court's ruling here also properly reflected that dual role. In explaining its choice of a sentence, the district court described appellant's offense as \"serious\" and \"egregious,\" noted that his unlawful activity began \"not even a year\" after he had taken office as mayor, and pointed to his attempt to tamper with three potential witnesses during the investigation. The court also observed that, despite opportunities for appellant to express remorse, \"sadly, he has failed to do so.\" The court concluded its review of the circumstances as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>So where should I sentence the defendant under these circumstances? I do think if we are going to consider the seriousness of what happened in this case and we are going to consider the state of affairs in this case as of today, the only thing to do, the only proper thing to do would be to sentence him at the same level we sentenced him before, which is the 63 months.</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, the court did not \"increase\" his sentence based on lack of remorse, but instead chose the sentence from within the recommended range that it deemed most suited to the defendant and his conduct.</p>\n<p>The court's consideration of appellant's attitude toward the crime, as well as the serious nature of the offense, was appropriate under both the Guidelines and 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), the statutory provision governing the imposition of a sentence. Guidelines § 1B1.4 provides:</p>\n<blockquote>In determining the sentence to impose within the guideline range, or whether a departure from the guidelines is warranted, the court may consider, without limitation, any information concerning the background, character and conduct of the defendant, unless otherwise prohibited by law. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 3661.<sup>[2]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>Section 3553 states that, \"in determining the particular sentence to be imposed,\" the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*237</span> court shall consider \"the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(1). The statute also directs the court to consider, inter alia, \"the need for the sentence imposed ... to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense,\" <i>id.</i> § 3553(a)(2)(A), and the need \"to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant,\" <i>id.</i> § 3553(a)(2)(C). Appellant's refusal to acknowledge that he committed criminal acts is information that falls well within both of these guiding provisions, giving relevant insight into his character and raising concerns about his respect for the law and his future conduct.</p>\n<p>Appellant argues that, despite its seeming relevance, his lack of remorse is \"prohibited by law\" from being considered, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. § 1B1.4, because reliance on his refusal to accept responsibility violates his constitutional right to maintain his innocence. We explicitly have rejected an equivalent argument  that the Guidelines provision allowing a reduction for acceptance of responsibility places the defendant \"in the unconstitutional dilemma of abandoning his right not to incriminate himself or risking a higher sentence.\" <i>Paz Uribe,</i> 891 F.2d at 400; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. De Jongh,</i> 937 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1991). The constitutional argument is no more persuasive here. \"[N]ot every burden on a right or encouragement to waive a right is invalid,\" <i>Paz Uribe,</i> 891 F.2d at 400, and it is well established that lack of remorse is a proper consideration in sentencing, <i>United States v. Johnson,</i> 903 F.2d 1084, 1090 (7th Cir.1990) (citing cases). <i>See also </i><i>United States v. Jahagirdar,</i> 466 F.3d 149, 157 (1st Cir.2006) (noting district court's reliance on lack of remorse, among other factors, in upholding sentence as reasonable); <i>United States v. Thompson,</i> 476 F.2d 1196, 1201 (7th Cir. 1973) (\"A show of lenience to those who exhibit contrition by admitting guilt does not carry a corollary that the Judge indulges a policy of penalizing those who elect to stand trial.\").</p>\n<p>Accordingly, we find no error in the court's reliance on lack of remorse among the factors it considered in setting appellant's sentence at the high end of the applicable Guidelines range.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Mitigation Testimony</h2>\n<p>Appellant argues that the district court erred in restricting his presentation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*238</span> of testimony in mitigation of his punishment. He sought to present nine witnesses on various issues, including his innocence and the amount of restitution. Consistent with its ruling that the single issue before it was the appropriate term of imprisonment, the court allowed testimony only about appellant's character.<sup>[4]</sup> Defendant called four witnesses, only two of whom turned out to know him personally. They testified that appellant was \"a good citizen,\" that he was \"very devoted to the municipality,\" that he was, in general, \"a good person,\" and, \"if he made any mistakes or infractions, perhaps it was lack of orientation.\" In addition, his attorney submitted the questions he had wanted to ask all nine witnesses as well as the outline of the argument he intended to make if he had been allowed to fully question the proposed witnesses. The court thus had ample insight into defendant's concerns. Cruzado also gave a lengthy allocution in which he asserted that the case against him was fabricated by the government. In support of his statement, the court allowed him to submit an audit report from the municipality.</p>\n<p>In claiming that the court's limitations on witness testimony violated his right to allocution under Fed.R.Crim.P. 32, appellant primarily relies on inapposite case law concerning the rights of defendants in death penalty cases. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 32 does not give defendants the right to call witnesses in their behalf at sentencing. The rule only requires the court to allow the defendant and his attorney to speak. Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(4)(A)(i), (ii);<sup>[5]</sup><i>see </i><i>United States v. Rodriguez,</i> 336 F.3d 67, 70 (1st Cir.2003) (\"It is a familiar rule that a criminal defendant, about to be sentenced, is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing on demand.\"); <i>United States v. Heller,</i> 797 F.2d 41, 43 (1st Cir.1986) (\"Although the defendant must be given the chance to inform the court of any mitigating circumstances, he does not have the right to have others testify for him at a sentencing.\"). In the context of this case, the district court was more than generous in giving appellant an opportunity to comment on the appropriate sentence through witness testimony, his own statement, counsel's argument, and the supporting documents. He was entitled to no more.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Judicial Bias</h2>\n<p>Appellant claims that he was denied due process at his resentencing hearing because the district judge was biased against him and should have disqualified himself. In support of this claim, appellant primarily relies on the district court's refusal to grant him bail pending the resentencing hearing, which was scheduled to occur after appellant already had been incarcerated for more than 51 months  the low point of the applicable Guidelines range. Appellant asserts that the denial of bail \"could mean only one thing  [the judge] already knew that he would impose a sentence above the time already served. Hence he was clearly biased.\" Appellant also cites the district court's rulings on the scope of the appeal, the presentation of mitigation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*239</span> evidence, and the appropriateness of considering his lack of acceptance of responsibility. In addition, he refers in a footnote to disciplinary proceedings against his counsel that were processed by the district judge in this case in his role as Chief Judge of the District, but that were initiated by two other judges.</p>\n<p>These complaints do not remotely establish a due process violation. Recusal is required only when a judge's \"impartiality might reasonably be questioned,\" 28 U.S.C. § 455(a), and judges should not \"recuse themselves lightly,\" <i>United States v. Snyder,</i> 235 F.3d 42, 45 (1st Cir.2000). <i>See also id.</i> at 46 (\"[A] judge has a duty to recuse himself if his impartiality can reasonably be questioned; but otherwise, he has a duty to sit.\"). The court's denial of bail pending the hearing is an insufficient indicator of bias, given that the sentencing range went up to 63 months and a higher non-Guidelines sentence could have been imposed. The court was familiar with the case, having presided over the trial and twice previously sentenced appellant; it reasonably could have anticipated that appellant's new sentence would not be at the bottom of the range. <i>See </i><i>In re United States,</i> 441 F.3d 44, 67 (1st Cir.2006) (noting \"the principle that a judge's rulings and statements in the course of proceedings before him or her rarely provide a basis for recusal under § 455(a)\").</p>\n<p>Moreover, the court did not ignore the timing issue. It ordered appellant's expedited transfer to Puerto Rico so that the hearing could take place as soon as possible. In addition, as described above, the judge did not have a closed mind about the term of imprisonment and stated that he would have considered a lower sentence if appellant had expressed remorse. Finally, the fact that disciplinary complaints were filed by other judges against defense counsel is insufficient to taint a sentencing hearing that was, as we have discussed, properly conducted. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Mendoza,</i> 468 F.3d 1256, 1262 (10th Cir. 2006) (holding that judge's own referral of counsel for disciplinary review was not a basis for questioning judge's impartiality); <i>In re Cooper,</i> 821 F.2d 833, 838 (1st Cir. 1987) (per curiam) (\"Generally, clashes between court and counsel are an insufficient basis for disqualification....\"). We therefore reject appellant's contention that judicial bias caused a denial of his due process rights.</p>\n<p>Affirmed.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Although Cruzado has completed serving his term of imprisonment, this appeal has not become moot because of his challenges to the amounts of restitution and fine. <i>See </i><i>Spencer v. Kemna,</i> 523 U.S. 1, 7, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998) (holding that appeal of a conviction is rendered moot upon expiration of sentence unless defendant alleges some continuing \"`collateral consequence'\"); <i>United States v. Molak,</i> 276 F.3d 45, 48-49 (1st Cir.2002) (noting that restitution order provides a pecuniary interest in the outcome of the appeal, avoiding mootness). In addition, if Cruzado were to succeed with a claim that his sentence was improperly calculated, his three-year period of supervised release could be reduced on remand. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Verdin,</i> 243 F.3d 1174, 1178 (9th Cir.2001) (finding that defendant's sentencing appeal was not moot because, \"[i]f he were to prevail ... he could be resentenced to a shorter period of supervised release\").</p>\n<p>[2]  Section 3661 provides: \"No limitation shall be placed on the information concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person convicted of an offense which a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence.\"</p>\n<p>[3]  We note that the district court originally imposed a 63-month term of imprisonment at the first of appellant's three sentencing proceedings. At that time, the term was at the top of the Guidelines range the district thought applicable. At appellant's initial resentencing hearing, the government recommended that, even though 63 months was the <i>low</i> end of the correct range, the court \"in all fairness, should go ahead and give him the minimum range of this guideline which is 63 months.\" The prosecutor observed that it would be unfair to impose a higher sentence as a result of his successful appeal. The court accepted that recommendation, stating that \"it would be a material injustice to a defendant who has done nothing other than to exercise his constitutional right to an appeal and trial, ... to punish him for the fact that he ended up with a higher guideline.\" Thus, the record shows that the court has never viewed appellant as deserving a sentence at the low end of the applicable Guidelines range, having imposed a low-end sentence in the second sentencing hearing as a matter of fairness. Thus, the court's latest determination that the appropriate sentence is 63 months  which once again falls at the high end of the applicable range  does not indicate either a new or improper escalation in the court's perception of appellant's culpability or the appropriate penalty.</p>\n<p>[4]  Appellant argues that the amount of loss suffered by the victims was relevant to the determination of his sentence, as well as to restitution. However, testimony about loss at the sentencing hearing was unnecessary given that the court already had made a finding on loss in connection with the restitution order.</p>\n<p>[5]  Rule 32(i)(4) states, in relevant part:\n</p>\n<p>(A) By a Party. Before imposing sentence, the court must:</p>\n<p>(i) provide the defendant's attorney an opportunity to speak on the defendant's behalf;</p>\n<p>(ii) address the defendant personally in order to permit the defendant to speak or present any information to mitigate the sentence....</p>\n\n</div>",

A third sentencing hearing was held in April 2006, nearly four years after Cruzado was convicted on corruption-related charges. He now attempts a new round of challenges to his sixty-three month term of imprisonment and the related imposition of restitution and a fine. Finding no merit in any of these claims, we affirm all aspects of his sentence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>The factual background of appellant's crimes was fully detailed in our two prior opinions. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Cruzado-Laureano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202099\"><a href=\"/opinion/202099/united-states-v-cruzado-laureano/\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></a></span>, 45 (1st Cir.2006) (\"<i>Cruzado II</i>\"); <i>United States v. Cruzado-Laureano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201519\"><a href=\"/opinion/201519/united-states-v-cruzado-laureano/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">470</span></a></span>, 473-79 (1st Cir.2005) (\"<i>Cruzado I</i>\"). It suffices to say here that Cruzado, the former mayor of Vega Alta, Puerto Rico, was convicted by a jury in June 2002 on charges of embezzlement, extortion, money laundering and witness tampering stemming from conduct undertaken while he was in office, including demanding kickbacks on municipal contracts. The district court imposed a 63-month term of imprisonment and a $10,000 fine, and subsequently ordered Cruzado to pay restitution in the amount of $14,251.82.</p>\n<p>In his first appeal, we rejected various challenges to his conviction, but remanded for resentencing because the district court had applied the wrong version of the Sentencing Guidelines. After a new calculation on remand, the court again imposed a 63-month term, which was the bottom of the new Guidelines range of 63-78 months, and reinstated the same fine and restitution amounts. <i>See </i><i>Cruzado II,</i> 440 F.3d at 47. Cruzado filed a second appeal challenging the district court's application of several Guidelines provisions. We detected a single flaw  that the court erroneously had applied an enhancement for abuse of a position of public trust under U.S.S.G. § 3B1.3. <i>Id.</i> at 48-49. We therefore again remanded for resentencing, noting that \"we do not intend to intimate that the length of the sentence should necessarily be changed.\" <i>Id.</i> at 50. We also stated that Cruzado's challenges to the district court's imposition of restitution, a fine and supervised release were \"too perfunctory... to permit us to evaluate the merits of those aspects of his punishment,\" citing our well established precedent that issues \"`unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation[ ] are deemed waived,'\" <i>Id.</i> at 47 n. 7 (quoting <i>United States v. Zannino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1990)).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*234</span> A third sentencing hearing was held on April 26, 2006. Cruzado and the government agreed on the criminal history category (I) and the total base offense level (24), which resulted in a Guidelines range of 51 to 63 months of imprisonment. Cruzado argued at the hearing that the district court could reconsider all aspects of his sentence, including restitution, because the appeals court had not explicitly limited the remand to a reassessment of the correct term of imprisonment without the abuse-of-trust enhancement. He also sought to present witnesses to prove that he was \"actually innocent,\" that he had been subject to malicious prosecution, and that there were no victims of his crime  and hence no need for restitution  because no loss had occurred. The district court determined that it could consider only the appropriate sentence within the applicable Guidelines range. It agreed, however, to hear character testimony from four witnesses, and it allowed Cruzado to submit the questions his counsel had planned to ask of those witnesses and the five additional witnesses he had wanted to call. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court again imposed a 63-month term and also re-imposed the same restitution ($14,251.82) and fine ($10,000).</p>\n<p>Cruzado has once again appealed his sentence, raising five claims of error: (1) the district court improperly refused to conduct a de novo hearing; (2) even if a full de novo resentencing was barred, the court should have made new findings on the restitution and fine amounts because they are integral elements of every sentence; (3) the court impermissibly double-counted his lack of acceptance of responsibility; (4) appellant should have been allowed to present victim testimony in mitigation of his punishment; and (5) bias on the part of the sentencing judge denied appellant due process, requiring resentencing before a different judge. We briefly explain why each of these contentions fails.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Scope of Remand/Restitution and Fine</h2>\n<p>Appellant argues that the district court improperly limited the scope of his latest sentencing hearing to a decision on the appropriate term of imprisonment within the recalculated Guidelines range, which was corrected from 63-78 months to 51-63 months. Cruzado asserts that resentencings after remand should be conducted as de novo proceedings and that his entire sentence  including the amount of restitution  was therefore open to reconsideration. Although some circuits do generally allow de novo resentencing on remand, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Duso,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"684106\"><a href=\"/opinion/684106/united-states-v-lawrence-c-duso/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">365</span></a></span>, 368 (6th Cir.1994); <i>United States v. Smith,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"559571\"><a href=\"/opinion/559571/united-states-v-stan-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">930</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1450</span></a></span>, 1456 (10th Cir. 1991), the First Circuit does not. In <i>United States v. Ticchiarelli,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198379\"><a href=\"/opinion/198379/united-states-v-ticchiarelli/\"><span class=\"volume\">171</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1999), we held:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*235</span> \"[U]pon a resentencing occasioned by a remand, unless the court of appeals [has expressly directed otherwise], the district court may consider only such new arguments or new facts as are made newly relevant by the court of appeals' decision  whether by the reasoning or by the result.\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 32 (quoting <i>United States v. Whren,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"739902\"><a href=\"/opinion/739902/united-states-v-michael-a-whren/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">956</span></a></span>, 960 (D.C.Cir.1997)).</p>\n<p>Appellant acknowledges this precedent, which gives the panel remanding the case for resentencing the responsibility for altering the normal scope of the new sentencing hearing. Hence, he appears to concede that the issue of de novo resentencing is not, as a general principle, properly before us. <i>See </i><i>Naser Jewelers, Inc. v. Concord,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203109\"><a href=\"/opinion/203109/naser-jewelers-inc-v-city-of-concord-nh/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, 36 (1st Cir.2008) (noting that a subsequent panel lacks power to overrule the decision of an earlier panel). The issue is raised, he explains, to preserve it for en banc and Supreme Court review.</p>\n<p>However, as a separate challenge, he contends that restitution and a fine are such \"integral\" parts of a sentence that, even in a remand limited to correcting the abuse-of-trust error, they are within the exception carved out in <i>Ticchiarelli</i> for matters \"`made newly relevant by the court of appeals' decision.'\" 171 F.3d at 32. In effect, he argues that whenever a court resentences a defendant, it must reconsider any related restitution and fine.</p>\n<p>This attempt to avoid the holding in <i>Ticchiarelli</i> is unavailing in this case. Cruzado contested restitution at his second sentencing hearing and challenged both restitution and the fine in his prior appeal. However, as noted above, we deemed those challenges waived because the claims were inadequately developed. The need to correct the abuse-of-trust error has not given new merit to his opposition to those assessments. In this appeal, he argues that restitution was improper because no victim had a loss and that the fine was improper because he had no resources to pay it. These assertions are unrelated to the abuse-of-trust issue and had no relationship to the issue before the court on remand  the appropriate length of the sentence under the Guidelines. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Elizondo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"47940\"><a href=\"/opinion/47940/united-states-v-elizondo/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">692</span></a></span>, 697 (5th Cir.2007) (holding that a remand for resentencing in light of <i>United States v. Booker,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></span> (2005), did not re-open the issue of restitution).</p>\n<p>Cruzado also suggests that, given the lower base offense level resulting from his second appeal, the district court should have considered imposing lower amounts of restitution and fine. However, defense counsel acknowledged at the sentencing hearing that the fine imposed, $10,000, was the lowest point of a range that went up to $500,000. The restitution order was based on specific findings of loss and not on Guidelines sentencing ranges. Because neither the amount of restitution nor the size of the fine was \"`made newly relevant by the court of appeals' decision,'\" appellant is not entitled to another opportunity to assert these claims. <i>Ticchiarelli,</i> 171 F.3d at 32 (quoting <i>Whren,</i> 111 F.3d at 960).</p>\n<p>The district court therefore properly limited the scope of the latest sentencing hearing to consideration of the appropriate sentence within the applicable Guidelines range, and our review is likewise restricted to issues related to appellant's term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Double Counting of Failure to Express Remorse</h2>\n<p>Appellant argues that the district court improperly considered his lack of remorse in deciding to re-impose a 63-month term of imprisonment, which had <span class=\"star-pagination\">*236</span> become the high end of the applicable Guidelines range after the court eliminated the erroneous two-level enhancement for abuse of trust. At his previous sentencing, 63 months was the low end of the applicable range. Appellant contends that using his lack of remorse to justify a high-end sentence amounted to impermissible double-counting because his refusal to admit guilt already was taken into account when he did not receive a decrease in offense level for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1.</p>\n<p>This contention also is foreclosed by First Circuit precedent. In <i>United States v. Paz Uribe,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">891</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">396</span></span>, 400 (1st Cir. 1989), we rejected the appellant's claim that the district court erred by twice considering his failure to accept responsibility. The appellant had argued that improper double counting occurred when the court considered his denial of responsibility in sentencing him at the top of the applicable Guidelines range given that the range had been \"premised on there being no acceptance of responsibility.\" <i>Id.</i> We noted that the district court has discretion to tailor a sentence to the individual defendant and the circumstances of his offense, and concluded that, \"in the absence of an acceptance of responsibility,\" the court properly selected the high end of the Guidelines range \"[d]ue to the substantial amount of cocaine involved.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>We thus recognized in <i>Paz Uribe</i> that lack of remorse may permissibly serve two different functions under the Guidelines: to disqualify a defendant from receiving a reduction in offense level for acceptance of responsibility and as a factor in determining the defendant's particular sentence within the Guidelines range. The district court's ruling here also properly reflected that dual role. In explaining its choice of a sentence, the district court described appellant's offense as \"serious\" and \"egregious,\" noted that his unlawful activity began \"not even a year\" after he had taken office as mayor, and pointed to his attempt to tamper with three potential witnesses during the investigation. The court also observed that, despite opportunities for appellant to express remorse, \"sadly, he has failed to do so.\" The court concluded its review of the circumstances as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>So where should I sentence the defendant under these circumstances? I do think if we are going to consider the seriousness of what happened in this case and we are going to consider the state of affairs in this case as of today, the only thing to do, the only proper thing to do would be to sentence him at the same level we sentenced him before, which is the 63 months.</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, the court did not \"increase\" his sentence based on lack of remorse, but instead chose the sentence from within the recommended range that it deemed most suited to the defendant and his conduct.</p>\n<p>The court's consideration of appellant's attitude toward the crime, as well as the serious nature of the offense, was appropriate under both the Guidelines and 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), the statutory provision governing the imposition of a sentence. Guidelines § 1B1.4 provides:</p>\n<blockquote>In determining the sentence to impose within the guideline range, or whether a departure from the guidelines is warranted, the court may consider, without limitation, any information concerning the background, character and conduct of the defendant, unless otherwise prohibited by law. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 3661.<sup>[2]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>Section 3553 states that, \"in determining the particular sentence to be imposed,\" the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*237</span> court shall consider \"the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(1). The statute also directs the court to consider, inter alia, \"the need for the sentence imposed ... to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense,\" <i>id.</i> § 3553(a)(2)(A), and the need \"to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant,\" <i>id.</i> § 3553(a)(2)(C). Appellant's refusal to acknowledge that he committed criminal acts is information that falls well within both of these guiding provisions, giving relevant insight into his character and raising concerns about his respect for the law and his future conduct.</p>\n<p>Appellant argues that, despite its seeming relevance, his lack of remorse is \"prohibited by law\" from being considered, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. § 1B1.4, because reliance on his refusal to accept responsibility violates his constitutional right to maintain his innocence. We explicitly have rejected an equivalent argument  that the Guidelines provision allowing a reduction for acceptance of responsibility places the defendant \"in the unconstitutional dilemma of abandoning his right not to incriminate himself or risking a higher sentence.\" <i>Paz Uribe,</i> 891 F.2d at 400; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. De Jongh,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563787\"><a href=\"/opinion/563787/united-states-v-maria-enriqueta-cirila-trinidad-de-jongh/\"><span class=\"volume\">937</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.1991). The constitutional argument is no more persuasive here. \"[N]ot every burden on a right or encouragement to waive a right is invalid,\" <i>Paz Uribe,</i> 891 F.2d at 400, and it is well established that lack of remorse is a proper consideration in sentencing, <i>United States v. Johnson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"541981\"><a href=\"/opinion/541981/united-states-v-victor-johnson-michael-joiner-and-melvin-buford/\"><span class=\"volume\">903</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1084</span></a></span>, 1090 (7th Cir.1990) (citing cases). <i>See also </i><i>United States v. Jahagirdar,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">149</span></span>, 157 (1st Cir.2006) (noting district court's reliance on lack of remorse, among other factors, in upholding sentence as reasonable); <i>United States v. Thompson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"310299\"><a href=\"/opinion/310299/united-states-v-waverly-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1196</span></a></span>, 1201 (7th Cir. 1973) (\"A show of lenience to those who exhibit contrition by admitting guilt does not carry a corollary that the Judge indulges a policy of penalizing those who elect to stand trial.\").</p>\n<p>Accordingly, we find no error in the court's reliance on lack of remorse among the factors it considered in setting appellant's sentence at the high end of the applicable Guidelines range.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Mitigation Testimony</h2>\n<p>Appellant argues that the district court erred in restricting his presentation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*238</span> of testimony in mitigation of his punishment. He sought to present nine witnesses on various issues, including his innocence and the amount of restitution. Consistent with its ruling that the single issue before it was the appropriate term of imprisonment, the court allowed testimony only about appellant's character.<sup>[4]</sup> Defendant called four witnesses, only two of whom turned out to know him personally. They testified that appellant was \"a good citizen,\" that he was \"very devoted to the municipality,\" that he was, in general, \"a good person,\" and, \"if he made any mistakes or infractions, perhaps it was lack of orientation.\" In addition, his attorney submitted the questions he had wanted to ask all nine witnesses as well as the outline of the argument he intended to make if he had been allowed to fully question the proposed witnesses. The court thus had ample insight into defendant's concerns. Cruzado also gave a lengthy allocution in which he asserted that the case against him was fabricated by the government. In support of his statement, the court allowed him to submit an audit report from the municipality.</p>\n<p>In claiming that the court's limitations on witness testimony violated his right to allocution under Fed.R.Crim.P. 32, appellant primarily relies on inapposite case law concerning the rights of defendants in death penalty cases. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 32 does not give defendants the right to call witnesses in their behalf at sentencing. The rule only requires the court to allow the defendant and his attorney to speak. Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(4)(A)(i), (ii);<sup>[5]</sup><i>see </i><i>United States v. Rodriguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200553\"><a href=\"/opinion/200553/united-states-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">336</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></a></span>, 70 (1st Cir.2003) (\"It is a familiar rule that a criminal defendant, about to be sentenced, is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing on demand.\"); <i>United States v. Heller,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"474190\"><a href=\"/opinion/474190/united-states-v-donald-a-heller/\"><span class=\"volume\">797</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 43 (1st Cir.1986) (\"Although the defendant must be given the chance to inform the court of any mitigating circumstances, he does not have the right to have others testify for him at a sentencing.\"). In the context of this case, the district court was more than generous in giving appellant an opportunity to comment on the appropriate sentence through witness testimony, his own statement, counsel's argument, and the supporting documents. He was entitled to no more.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Judicial Bias</h2>\n<p>Appellant claims that he was denied due process at his resentencing hearing because the district judge was biased against him and should have disqualified himself. In support of this claim, appellant primarily relies on the district court's refusal to grant him bail pending the resentencing hearing, which was scheduled to occur after appellant already had been incarcerated for more than 51 months  the low point of the applicable Guidelines range. Appellant asserts that the denial of bail \"could mean only one thing  [the judge] already knew that he would impose a sentence above the time already served. Hence he was clearly biased.\" Appellant also cites the district court's rulings on the scope of the appeal, the presentation of mitigation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*239</span> evidence, and the appropriateness of considering his lack of acceptance of responsibility. In addition, he refers in a footnote to disciplinary proceedings against his counsel that were processed by the district judge in this case in his role as Chief Judge of the District, but that were initiated by two other judges.</p>\n<p>These complaints do not remotely establish a due process violation. Recusal is required only when a judge's \"impartiality might reasonably be questioned,\" 28 U.S.C. § 455(a), and judges should not \"recuse themselves lightly,\" <i>United States v. Snyder,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199201\"><a href=\"/opinion/199201/united-states-v-snyder/\"><span class=\"volume\">235</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></a></span>, 45 (1st Cir.2000). <i>See also id.</i> at 46 (\"[A] judge has a duty to recuse himself if his impartiality can reasonably be questioned; but otherwise, he has a duty to sit.\"). The court's denial of bail pending the hearing is an insufficient indicator of bias, given that the sentencing range went up to 63 months and a higher non-Guidelines sentence could have been imposed. The court was familiar with the case, having presided over the trial and twice previously sentenced appellant; it reasonably could have anticipated that appellant's new sentence would not be at the bottom of the range. <i>See </i><i>In re United States,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></span>, 67 (1st Cir.2006) (noting \"the principle that a judge's rulings and statements in the course of proceedings before him or her rarely provide a basis for recusal under § 455(a)\").</p>\n<p>Moreover, the court did not ignore the timing issue. It ordered appellant's expedited transfer to Puerto Rico so that the hearing could take place as soon as possible. In addition, as described above, the judge did not have a closed mind about the term of imprisonment and stated that he would have considered a lower sentence if appellant had expressed remorse. Finally, the fact that disciplinary complaints were filed by other judges against defense counsel is insufficient to taint a sentencing hearing that was, as we have discussed, properly conducted. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Mendoza,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796013\"><a href=\"/opinion/796013/united-states-v-nicholas-mendoza/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1256</span></a></span>, 1262 (10th Cir. 2006) (holding that judge's own referral of counsel for disciplinary review was not a basis for questioning judge's impartiality); <i>In re Cooper,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"490114\"><a href=\"/opinion/490114/in-re-jonathan-cooper-and-steven-lynn/\"><span class=\"volume\">821</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">833</span></a></span>, 838 (1st Cir. 1987) (per curiam) (\"Generally, clashes between court and counsel are an insufficient basis for disqualification....\"). We therefore reject appellant's contention that judicial bias caused a denial of his due process rights.</p>\n<p>Affirmed.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Although Cruzado has completed serving his term of imprisonment, this appeal has not become moot because of his challenges to the amounts of restitution and fine. <i>See </i><i>Spencer v. Kemna,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118176\"><a href=\"/opinion/118176/spencer-v-kemna/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 7, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118176\"><a href=\"/opinion/118176/spencer-v-kemna/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">978</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118176\"><a href=\"/opinion/118176/spencer-v-kemna/\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span> (1998) (holding that appeal of a conviction is rendered moot upon expiration of sentence unless defendant alleges some continuing \"`collateral consequence'\"); <i>United States v. Molak,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199765\"><a href=\"/opinion/199765/united-states-v-molak/\"><span class=\"volume\">276</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 48-49 (1st Cir.2002) (noting that restitution order provides a pecuniary interest in the outcome of the appeal, avoiding mootness). In addition, if Cruzado were to succeed with a claim that his sentence was improperly calculated, his three-year period of supervised release could be reduced on remand. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Verdin,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">243</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1174</span></span>, 1178 (9th Cir.2001) (finding that defendant's sentencing appeal was not moot because, \"[i]f he were to prevail ... he could be resentenced to a shorter period of supervised release\").</p>\n<p>[2]  Section 3661 provides: \"No limitation shall be placed on the information concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person convicted of an offense which a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence.\"</p>\n<p>[3]  We note that the district court originally imposed a 63-month term of imprisonment at the first of appellant's three sentencing proceedings. At that time, the term was at the top of the Guidelines range the district thought applicable. At appellant's initial resentencing hearing, the government recommended that, even though 63 months was the <i>low</i> end of the correct range, the court \"in all fairness, should go ahead and give him the minimum range of this guideline which is 63 months.\" The prosecutor observed that it would be unfair to impose a higher sentence as a result of his successful appeal. The court accepted that recommendation, stating that \"it would be a material injustice to a defendant who has done nothing other than to exercise his constitutional right to an appeal and trial, ... to punish him for the fact that he ended up with a higher guideline.\" Thus, the record shows that the court has never viewed appellant as deserving a sentence at the low end of the applicable Guidelines range, having imposed a low-end sentence in the second sentencing hearing as a matter of fairness. Thus, the court's latest determination that the appropriate sentence is 63 months  which once again falls at the high end of the applicable range  does not indicate either a new or improper escalation in the court's perception of appellant's culpability or the appropriate penalty.</p>\n<p>[4]  Appellant argues that the amount of loss suffered by the victims was relevant to the determination of his sentence, as well as to restitution. However, testimony about loss at the sentencing hearing was unnecessary given that the court already had made a finding on loss in connection with the restitution order.</p>\n<p>[5]  Rule 32(i)(4) states, in relevant part:\n</p>\n<p>(A) By a Party. Before imposing sentence, the court must:</p>\n<p>(i) provide the defendant's attorney an opportunity to speak on the defendant's behalf;</p>\n<p>(ii) address the defendant personally in order to permit the defendant to speak or present any information to mitigate the sentence....</p>\n\n</div>",
