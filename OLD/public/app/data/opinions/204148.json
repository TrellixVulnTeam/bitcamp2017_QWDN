Michael A. Ponsor, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                        Lynch, Chief Judge,\n                 Selya and Stahl, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Thomas Lesser, with whom Lesser, Newman & Nasser was on brief,\nfor appellant.\n     Karen M.

This is a personal injury action\n\nbrought pursuant to the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA), 45\n\nU.S.C. §§ 51-60.       The jury found the defendant negligent but\n\nreduced the award of damages substantially based on a finding of\n\ncontributory negligence.     The plaintiff appeals, posing claims of\n\nboth instructional error and evidentiary insufficiency.           In the\n\nend, however, all roads lead to Rome, and a single exegesis\n\nsuffices to show that the record contains evidence adequate to\n\npermit jury consideration of the disputed issue (thus defeating the\n\nclaim of instructional error) and to ground a finding on that issue\n\n(thus   defeating     the   claim     of   evidentiary   insufficiency).\n\nAccordingly, we answer both questions at one fell swoop and affirm\n\nthe judgment below.\n\n          We rehearse the facts as the jury could have found them,\n\nmindful that \"when the losing party protests the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence, the court of appeals must take both the facts and the\n\nreasonable inferences therefrom in the light most hospitable to the\n\njury's verdict.\" Correa v. Hosp. San Francisco, 69 F.3d 1184, 1188\n\n(1st Cir. 1995).\n\n          Defendant-appellee        Springfield   Terminal   Railway   Co.\n\n(STRC), an employer subject to the FELA, employed plaintiff-\n\nappellant Donald J. Butynski for nearly a quarter of a century as\n\na trackman.   The plaintiff's base of operations was the STRC rail\n\nyard in East Deerfield, Massachusetts, but his job description\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fcalled for him to work as needed along the STRC's rail lines\n\nthroughout western Massachusetts.\n\n          On December 11, 2003, while part of a crew assigned to\n\nrepair tracks in Otter River, the plaintiff slipped and fell.        In\n\ntrying to break his fall, he fractured his wrist.       His injuries\n\nwere disabling and spelled the end of his career with STRC.\n\n          For some two weeks before the plaintiff's fall, Otter\n\nRiver had experienced rain, snow, and frigid temperatures.      On the\n\nday of the incident, the work site was icy (and, therefore,\n\nslippery).   That condition was open and obvious.\n\n          In the winter, icy conditions are common fare on the\n\nSTRC's lines. For that reason, STRC routinely furnishes its track-\n\nrepair personnel with ice creepers — safety devices, capable of\n\nbeing strapped to work boots, which contain embedded metal cleats\n\ndesigned to improve the wearer's footing on snow and ice.           Ice\n\ncreepers are generally sturdy, and once STRC furnishes a pair to a\n\ntrackman, there is no set schedule for periodic replenishment.       If\n\nthe trackman needs new ice creepers because his are worn out or\n\nlost, it is his responsibility to request replacements.\n\n          The   plaintiff's   foreman   testified   that,   given   the\n\nslippery conditions, wearing ice creepers was an appropriate safety\n\nmeasure at the time and place of the incident.      Nevertheless, the\n\nplaintiff did not don ice creepers that day because his were\n\nstretched out and no longer fit properly.       He admitted that he\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fknew, months earlier, that his ice creepers were shot.                   He said\n\nthat he unsuccessfully requested replacements on approximately four\n\noccasions during the fall of 2003.           His foreman confirmed that the\n\nplaintiff had asked for new ice creepers.\n\n               STRC   denied   that   any   such   requests    had    been   made.\n\nVarious supervisory personnel at the rail yard testified that they\n\ncould    not    recall   the   plaintiff     either     complaining    about   the\n\ncondition of his ice creepers or seeking new ones.                   The railroad\n\nhad no record of any such request.\n\n               Relatedly, there was no shortage of ice creepers in stock\n\nduring 2003.      For example, one supervisor testified that, prior to\n\nDecember 11, the rail yard had received seventy-eight pairs of ice\n\ncreepers (some large and some extra-large) and that ice creepers\n\nwere in adequate supply. STRC's witnesses stated that ice creepers\n\nwere typically available upon request and, in the event that ice\n\ncreepers were not immediately on hand to satisfy a request, new\n\nones normally would be provided within a week.\n\n               In its answer to the complaint, STRC denied liability and\n\npleaded    contributory        negligence    as    an    affirmative     defense.\n\nConsistent with this pleading, it advised the court in a pretrial\n\nsubmission that it would press for a jury instruction on that\n\nissue.    At the close of all the evidence, STRC reaffirmed that it\n\ndesired an instruction on this defense.            The plaintiff objected to\n\nany instruction on contributory negligence and moved for judgment\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fas a matter of law with respect to that issue.    The district court\n\nviewed contributory negligence as a live controversy and therefore\n\ndenied the motion for judgment as a matter of law.    Then, over the\n\nplaintiff's objection, the court instructed the jury, in relevant\n\npart:\n\n                   Contributory negligence is fault on the\n           part of the person injured, which cooperates\n           in some degree with the negligence of another,\n           and so helps to bring about the injury. By\n           the   defense   of   contributory   negligence,\n           defendant in effect alleges that, even if\n           defendant's negligence was one of the causes\n           of plaintiff's injuries, plaintiff himself, by\n           his own failure to use ordinary care under the\n           circumstances for his own safety, also\n           contributed one of the causes of any injuries\n           and damages he may have suffered.        It was\n           plaintiff's duty on December 11, 2003, to use\n           reasonable care to avoid or minimize risk and\n           possible injury to himself.\n\n           The jury found STRC liable and fixed the plaintiff's\n\ndamages at $511,886.    It then found the plaintiff contributorily\n\nnegligent and allocated fault sixty percent to him and forty\n\npercent to STRC. Accordingly, the jury returned a verdict in favor\n\nof the plaintiff for $204,754.\n\n           The plaintiff seasonably renewed his motion for judgment\n\nas a matter of law with respect to the contributory negligence\n\ndefense.   See Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a)-(b).   The district court denied\n\nthe renewed motion, finding sufficient evidence of contributory\n\nnegligence to support the jury's determination. This timely appeal\n\nensued.\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f             In this venue, the plaintiff contends that the trial\n\ncourt should not have charged the jury on contributory negligence\n\nand that, in all events, the finding of contributory negligence was\n\nbereft of any evidentiary foundation. Although these are framed as\n\nseparate assignments of error, they are for all practical purposes\n\none and the same.       The plaintiff's claim of instructional error\n\ndoes   not   take    issue   with    the    form   or   phrasing   of    the   jury\n\ninstruction but, rather, posits that the evidence did not warrant\n\ngiving such an instruction at all.                 This is exactly the same\n\nrationale on which his argument regarding the motion for judgment\n\nas a matter of law rests.\n\n             The    nature   of     the    applicable    standards      of   review\n\nillustrates why, in this instance, we can treat these two claims of\n\nerror in a single exegesis.               We review de novo a decision to\n\ninstruct the jury on a particular issue, see SEC v. Happ, 392 F.3d\n\n12, 28 (1st Cir. 2004), asking whether the evidence, viewed in the\n\nlight most favorable to the proponent of the instruction, justifies\n\njury consideration of the underlying issue.               See Levinsky's, Inc.\n\nv. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 127 F.3d 122, 135 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\nSimilarly, we review de novo the denial of a motion for judgment as\n\na matter of law, Correa, 69 F.3d at 1191, asking whether the\n\nevidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmovant,\n\nwarrants jury consideration.               Zimmerman v. Direct Fed. Credit\n\nUnion, 262 F.3d 70, 75 (1st Cir. 2001).                  We will not overturn\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\feither the lower court's decision to instruct on an issue or its\n\neschewal of judgment as a matter of law unless, at a bare minimum,\n\nthe record reveals an insufficient evidentiary basis for the\n\ndecision.          See, e.g., Davis v. Rennie, 264 F.3d 86, 108-09 (1st\n\nCir. 2001) (jury instruction); Zimmerman, 262 F.3d at 75 (judgment\n\nas a matter of law).\n\n                  Here, the congruence of these standards is patent.                       In\n\nthe last analysis, each claim of error depends on a showing that\n\nthe    record       contains     an    insufficient      evidentiary      predicate        to\n\njustify jury consideration of the contributory negligence defense.\n\nThus, for ease in exposition, we proceed to discuss both claims of\n\nerror under the carapace of the claim of instructional error.1\n\n                  Evaluation     of    that   claim    starts    with    the   statutory\n\nscheme. FELA creates a federal cause of action for injured workers\n\nin the railroad industry.               45 U.S.C. § 51.      Congress has specified\n\nthe rudiments of the right of action in the statute itself.                         Those\n\nrudiments         include   a    low    threshold      for   proving     fault   on    the\n\nemployer's part (and, thus, a low threshold for liability).                            See\n\nid.; Stevens v. Bangor & Aroostook R.R. Co., 97 F.3d 594, 597-98\n\n(1st       Cir.    1996).       Contributory        negligence   is     available     as   a\n\ndefense.           45 U.S.C.     §    53.     It is not a complete bar to a\n\nplaintiff's recovery but, rather, operates to diminish the recovery\n\n\n\n       1\n       There is one exception, see infra note 3 and accompanying\ntext, but that is not a matter of any consequence.\n\n                                              -7-\n\fin proportion to the parties' comparative fault.                 See id.; Norfolk\n\nS. Ry. Co. v. Sorrell, 549 U.S. 158, 168 (2007).                 Congress has not\n\nspelled out the dimensions of the defense, so courts must hew to\n\nits common law formulation.           See Sorrell, 549 U.S. at 168, 171; see\n\nalso Jacobson v. N.Y., New Haven & Hartford R.R. Co., 206 F.2d 153,\n\n155     (1st    Cir.    1953)    (explaining      that    when   FELA     does   not\n\nspecifically      provide       otherwise,     concepts   like    negligence     and\n\ncontributory negligence may be fleshed out from federal common\n\nlaw).\n\n               An employer in a FELA case, like a prototypical defendant\n\nat    common     law,   has     the   burden    of   proving     the    plaintiff's\n\ncontributory negligence.           Sorrell, 549 U.S. at 171.           To do so, the\n\nemployer must show that \"the plaintiff's own negligence played a\n\npart in causing the injury.\"           Hopkins v. Jordan Marine, Inc., 271\n\nF.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2001);2 accord Wright v. Ark. & Mo. R.R. Co.,\n\n574 F.3d 612, 616-17 (8th Cir. 2009).             An employer who has asserted\n\na defense of contributory negligence in a FELA case is entitled to\n\na jury instruction on that defense as long as the record contains\n\nsome evidence from which contributory negligence can be inferred.\n\nSee Harris v. Ill. Cent. R.R. Co., 58 F.3d 1140, 1144 (6th Cir.\n\n1995); Wise v. Union Pac. R.R., 815 F.2d 55, 57 (8th Cir. 1987);\n\n\n      2\n       Hopkins is a Jones Act case, but the Jones Act incorporates\nthe relevant provisions of the FELA by reference. See 46 U.S.C.\n§ 30104. Thus, precedent under the Jones Act is deemed instructive\nin FELA cases, and vice versa. See Ellenwood v. Exxon Shipping\nCo., 984 F.2d 1270, 1281 n.15 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n                                         -8-\n\fsee also Wilson v. Mar. Overseas Corp., 150 F.3d 1, 11-12 (1st Cir.\n\n1998).\n\n          In    this   case,   the   plaintiff's   theory   of   liability\n\nrelated to STRC's failure to provide him with proper equipment\n\nwhen it assigned him, in icy conditions, to repair the tracks.\n\nThe jury found STRC liable, and that finding is not challenged on\n\nappeal.   Thus, the lens of our inquiry narrows to focus on the\n\njury's finding of contributory negligence and, more specifically,\n\nthe propriety vel non of allowing the jury to decide that issue.\n\nThis, in turn, hinges on whether the jury supportably could have\n\nfound that the plaintiff's acts or omissions played a part in\n\nbringing about his injuries.\n\n          The record makes manifest that the plaintiff did not\n\nwear ice creepers on the day in question and that, in the opinion\n\nof some, wearing them would have made the workplace safer.             The\n\nrecord makes equally clear that the plaintiff did not wear ice\n\ncreepers because the ones that STRC had furnished him were no\n\nlonger usable.     The jury heard contradictory evidence (or, at\n\nleast, evidence from which contradictory inferences could be\n\ndrawn) about why the plaintiff was without usable ice creepers at\n\nthat time.     Viewing the evidence as a whole, we think that the\n\njury reasonably could have found either that the plaintiff failed\n\nto request new ice creepers or, at least, that he did not request\n\nthem in a timeous manner.       Relatedly, the jury could have found\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fthat STRC had ice creepers on hand and available for the asking.\n\nFindings of this sort would have supported a plausible conclusion\n\nthat the plaintiff was, in part, the author of his own misfortune.\n\nWhere,   as    here,      there     is   room    for    a    jury   to   choose     among\n\ncompeting, record-rooted inferences, there is no basis for taking\n\nthe issue from the jury.              See Hopkins, 271 F.3d at 3-4; Wilson,\n\n150 F.3d at 12.          There was, therefore, no error in instructing the\n\njury on the issue of contributory negligence.\n\n              The plaintiff musters a trio of counter-arguments aimed\n\nat blunting the force of this reasoning.                            We examine these\n\ncounter-arguments sequentially.\n\n              First, the plaintiff contends that, by means of its\n\nopening statement and its summation, STRC admitted that he (the\n\nplaintiff)         was    not   negligent       (and,       thus,    foreclosed      jury\n\nconsideration of that issue).             This contention comprises more cry\n\nthan wool.\n\n              We    begin    with    first   principles.            Counsel   can    make\n\nadmissions during trial that will bind the client.                        Levinsky's,\n\nInc., 127 F.3d at 134.              Such admissions can be derived from the\n\ncontents of opening statements or closing arguments.                           Id.     In\n\norder to qualify as an admission under this rubric,                               such a\n\nstatement, when viewed in context, must be clear and unambiguous.\n\nId.; see also Best v. District of Columbia, 291 U.S. 411, 415-16\n\n(1934) (cautioning that counsel's opening statement will not\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\fqualify    as    an   admission   unless    the   supposedly   admitted   fact\n\n\"clearly appear[s]\" beyond all doubt to have been admitted).\n\n            In both his opening statement and his closing argument,\n\nSTRC's lawyer leaned heavily on the theory that STRC should not be\n\nheld liable because the December 11 incident, though unfortunate,\n\nwas merely an accident that occurred without fault on anyone's\n\npart.     But the lawyer did not in either instance put all his\n\nclient's eggs in this one forensic basket.                This multifaceted\n\napproach    is    particularly    evident    in   his   summation,   where   he\n\npointed out conflicts in the evidence anent the availability of\n\nice creepers and whether the plaintiff had requested new ones.\n\n            The plaintiff nonetheless asserts that, when all was\n\nsaid and done, STRC's attorney should be deemed to have admitted\n\nthat he (the plaintiff) was free from fault.               In examining this\n\nassertion, we think it useful to address the opening and closing\n\nseparately.      We start with the opening statement.\n\n            STRC's counsel told the jury that the proof would likely\n\nshow that what had happened was \"nobody's fault.\"              He called the\n\nevent an \"accident\" and did not mention contributory negligence as\n\nsuch.   But this is at most suggestive; the lawyer also pointed the\n\njury to anticipated evidence about the supply of ice creepers on\n\nhand and the uncertainty about whether the plaintiff had made a\n\nrequest to replace his dilapidated ice creepers.                 Given these\n\ncomments, we do not believe that the opening statement fairly can\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fbe said to constitute a clear and unambiguous admission that the\n\nplaintiff was free from fault.\n\n             This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the\n\nplaintiff    did    not   at   that   point   move    to   take     the      issue   of\n\ncontributory negligence from the jury.              Cf. Franchi Constr. Co. v.\n\nCombined Ins. Co., 580 F.2d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 1978) (noting trial\n\ncourt's power to direct verdict immediately following plaintiff's\n\nopening statement); Slotnick v. Staviskey, 560 F.2d 31, 32-34 (1st\n\nCir.   1977)     (affirming      directed      verdict      based       on     opening\n\nstatement).     Rather, the opening statement ended; the trial went\n\nforward; and STRC, through both cross-examination and the proffer\n\nof its own witnesses, introduced evidence relating to the degree\n\nof care exercised by the plaintiff.                 Had the opening statement\n\ncontained a clear and unambiguous admission that the plaintiff was\n\nnot guilty of contributory negligence, it is likely that the case\n\nwould have proceeded quite differently.\n\n             In his summation, STRC's lawyer argued that he \"felt\n\nthis   was   just   an    accident    that    happened     on    one    day.      [The\n\nplaintiff] lost his footing, as he said in his own report . . . .\"\n\nOnce again, there was no contemporaneous claim by the plaintiff\n\nthat   the     summation       constituted     an    admission         relative      to\n\ncontributory negligence — and for good reason.                  Having studied the\n\nclosing argument in its entirety, we are unable to find a clear\n\nand unambiguous concession anent the plaintiff's due care.\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\f            Taken in context, the references to an \"accident\" were\n\na tactic designed to persuade the jury that STRC's conduct was not\n\na cause-in-fact of the plaintiff's injury.             The speaker did not\n\nexclude other possibilities but, indeed, pointed out discrepancies\n\nin the evidence pertaining to whether the plaintiff had requested\n\nice creepers and reminded the jury about testimony attesting to\n\nthe ready availability of an adequate supply of ice creepers.\n\nThose allusions would have been senseless had the absence of\n\ncontributory negligence been admitted.\n\n            We conclude, without serious question, that contributory\n\nnegligence    was    a   live   issue,   admitted    neither   during   STRC's\n\nopening statement nor during its closing argument.             The mere fact\n\nthat   a   party's   counsel,     in   addressing    the   jury,   chooses   to\n\nemphasize one theory of the case does not, in and of itself,\n\noperate to waive the party's other defenses.           See, e.g., Haines v.\n\nRisely, 412 F.3d 285, 289-90 (1st Cir. 2005); Levinsky's, Inc.,\n\n127 F.3d at 134-35.\n\n            The plaintiff next strives to convince us that the\n\ndistrict court erroneously employed a \"cookie cutter\" approach to\n\ninstructing the jury; that is, that the court believed that\n\ncontributory negligence was an issue for the jury in every slip-\n\nand-fall case, regardless of the proof.             We are not persuaded.\n\n            To be sure, the trial court did say at one point that it\n\ntypically instructed on contributory negligence in slip-and-fall\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\fcases.   Be that as it may, the argument that the court applied a\n\nmechanical rule is a non-starter.             The evidence in this case,\n\nviewed in the light most favorable to the proponent of the\n\ndefense, warranted an instruction on contributory negligence.\n\nThus, there was no reversible error here.\n\n          The plaintiff's last argument is textual.3             It proceeds\n\nfrom the premise that the district court instructed the jury to\n\nevaluate the plaintiff's conduct on December 11, 2003, and not\n\notherwise.     Because    no   one   introduced     evidence   of   negligent\n\nconduct by the plaintiff on that day, the argument goes, any\n\nfinding of contributory negligence must have been a camouflaged\n\nfinding of assumption of the risk.          This would imply error because\n\nassumption   of   risk,   unlike     contributory     negligence,     is    not\n\ncognizable as a defense in FELA cases.           See 45 U.S.C. § 54.\n\n          At common law, the distinction between assumption of the\n\nrisk and contributory negligence is well-settled.              Assumption of\n\nthe risk arises out of the knowing and voluntary acceptance of a\n\ndangerous condition.      See Seaboard Air Line Ry. v. Horton, 233\n\nU.S. 492, 504-05 (1914); Hopkins, 271 F.3d at 3-4; see also\n\nRestatement (Second) of Torts §§ 496A, 496D (1965).             In contrast,\n\ncontributory   negligence      arises   out    of   any   \"careless   act    or\n\nomission on the plaintiff's part tending to add new dangers to\n\n\n     3\n       Technically speaking, this argument is not a claim of\ninstructional error but, rather, a pure claim of evidentiary\ninsufficiency.\n\n                                     -14-\n\f[existing] conditions.\"       Taylor v. Burlington N. R.R. Co., 787\n\nF.2d 1309, 1316 (9th Cir. 1986); see also Seaboard Air Line Ry.,\n\n233 U.S. at 503-04 (defining contributory negligence as a failure\n\nby the plaintiff to use ordinary care).\n\n              On this record, we do not think it can be said that the\n\njury conflated these two concepts.        Although the district court\n\ntold the jury that \"[i]t was plaintiff's duty on December 11,\n\n2003, to use reasonable care to avoid or minimize . . . possible\n\ninjury to himself\" (emphasis supplied), it makes no sense to read\n\nthat phrase in isolation and treat it as a circumscription of the\n\nissue of contributory negligence.         Jury instructions must be\n\nreviewed contextually.        An inquiring court should look at the\n\ncharge as a whole and give the words used to convey the judge's\n\nmessage   a    common-sense   interpretation.   See   Ellis   v.   United\n\nStates, 313 F.3d 636, 645 (1st Cir. 2002); Elliott v. S.D. Warren\n\nCo., 134 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1998); see also Hopkins, 271 F.3d at\n\n4 (stating that \"the test of jury instructions is not abstract\n\nperfection\").\n\n              In the case at hand, the jury heard a great deal of\n\ntestimony about the process for ensuring that track-repair workers\n\nhad ice creepers, the availability of replacement ice creepers,\n\nthe condition of the plaintiff's ice creepers, and when the\n\nplaintiff requested new ones.      This evidence framed the extent to\n\nwhich the plaintiff's acts and omissions were put in issue.          The\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\fjury was instructed in broad terms, quoted supra, to consider the\n\nplaintiff's part (if any) in causing the accident.\n\n                 It is also worth noting that the district court put the\n\nnon-issue of assumption of the risk off limits.                   The court warned\n\nthe   jury       against   reducing   the      plaintiff's      recovery   based   on\n\nassumption of the risk, stating:\n\n                 Keep in mind also that even though an employee\n                 such as plaintiff may know that the railroad\n                 has been negligent in failing to furnish him\n                 with necessary equipment such as properly\n                 functioning ice creepers, he does not, merely\n                 by continuing to perform his job, act\n                 negligently himself.\n\n                        . . .     Contributory negligence may\n                 arise only from plaintiff's own act or acts of\n                 negligence, not from knowingly taking on a\n                 risk inherent in the work environment or a\n                 risk created by defendant's negligence.\n\n                 Given these facts, the context of the trial does not\n\nlend itself to the notion that the charge limited the jury's\n\nconsideration of the plaintiff's due care to the day of the\n\naccident.          The court's date-specific allusion represented an\n\nattempt      —    albeit   an   awkward    attempt     —   to   focus   the   jury's\n\nattention on the circumstances leading up to the fall.                        Fairly\n\nread, the charge did not direct the jury to play the ostrich and\n\nignore    the      copious   evidence     of     plaintiff's     earlier   acts    and\n\nomissions that formed the basis for STRC's contributory negligence\n\ndefense.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -16-\n\f            We   need   go   no   further.   The   plaintiff's   claim   of\n\ninstructional error fails.           That conclusion requires us, for\n\nreasons already stated, to uphold as well the denial of the\n\nplaintiff's motion for judgment as a matter of law.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\f",

Thursby, with whom Herlihy, Thursby &amp; Herlihy, LLP was on brief, for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before: LYNCH, Chief Judge, SELYA and STAHL, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>SELYA, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>This is a personal injury action brought pursuant to the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA), 45 U.S.C. §§ 51-60. The jury found the defendant negligent but reduced the award of damages substantially based on a finding of contributory negligence. The plaintiff appeals, posing claims of both instructional error and evidentiary insufficiency. In the end, however, all roads lead to Rome, and a single exegesis suffices to show that the record contains evidence adequate to permit jury consideration of the disputed issue (thus defeating the claim of instructional error) and to ground a finding on that issue (thus defeating the claim of evidentiary insufficiency). Accordingly, we answer both questions at one fell swoop and affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p>We rehearse the facts as the jury could have found them, mindful that \"when the losing party protests the sufficiency of the evidence, the court of appeals must take both the facts and the reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most hospitable to the jury's verdict.\" <i>Correa v. Hosp. San Francisco,</i> 69 F.3d 1184, 1188 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n<p>Defendant-appellee Springfield Terminal Railway Co. (STRC), an employer subject to the FELA, employed plaintiff-appellant Donald J. Butynski for nearly a quarter of a century as a trackman. The plaintiff's base of operations was the STRC rail yard in East Deerfield, Massachusetts, but his job description called for him to work as needed along the STRC's rail lines throughout western Massachusetts.</p>\n<p>On December 11, 2003, while part of a crew assigned to repair tracks in Otter River, the plaintiff slipped and fell. In trying to break his fall, he fractured his wrist. His injuries were disabling and spelled the end of his career with STRC.</p>\n<p>For some two weeks before the plaintiff's fall, Otter River had experienced rain, snow, and frigid temperatures. On the day of the incident, the work site was icy (and, therefore, slippery). That condition was open and obvious.</p>\n<p>In the winter, icy conditions are common fare on the STRC's lines. For that reason, STRC routinely furnishes its track-repair personnel with ice creeperssafety devices, capable of being strapped to work boots, which contain embedded metal cleats designed to improve the wearer's footing on snow and ice. Ice creepers are generally sturdy, and once STRC furnishes a pair to a trackman, there is no set schedule for periodic replenishment. If the trackman needs new ice creepers because his are worn out or lost, it is his responsibility to request replacements.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*275</span> The plaintiff's foreman testified that, given the slippery conditions, wearing ice creepers was an appropriate safety measure at the time and place of the incident. Nevertheless, the plaintiff did not don ice creepers that day because his were stretched out and no longer fit properly. He admitted that he knew, months earlier, that his ice creepers were shot. He said that he unsuccessfully requested replacements on approximately four occasions during the fall of 2003. His foreman confirmed that the plaintiff had asked for new ice creepers.</p>\n<p>STRC denied that any such requests had been made. Various supervisory personnel at the rail yard testified that they could not recall the plaintiff either complaining about the condition of his ice creepers or seeking new ones. The railroad had no record of any such request.</p>\n<p>Relatedly, there was no shortage of ice creepers in stock during 2003. For example, one supervisor testified that, prior to December 11, the rail yard had received seventy-eight pairs of ice creepers (some large and some extra-large) and that ice creepers were in adequate supply. STRC's witnesses stated that ice creepers were typically available upon request and, in the event that ice creepers were not immediately on hand to satisfy a request, new ones normally would be provided within a week.</p>\n<p>In its answer to the complaint, STRC denied liability and pleaded contributory negligence as an affirmative defense. Consistent with this pleading, it advised the court in a pretrial submission that it would press for a jury instruction on that issue. At the close of all the evidence, STRC reaffirmed that it desired an instruction on this defense. The plaintiff objected to any instruction on contributory negligence and moved for judgment as a matter of law with respect to that issue. The district court viewed contributory negligence as a live controversy and therefore denied the motion for judgment as a matter of law. Then, over the plaintiff's objection, the court instructed the jury, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote>Contributory negligence is fault on the part of the person injured, which cooperates in some degree with the negligence of another, and so helps to bring about the injury. By the defense of contributory negligence, defendant in effect alleges that, even if defendant's negligence was one of the causes of plaintiff's injuries, plaintiff himself, by his own failure to use ordinary care under the circumstances for his own safety, also contributed one of the causes of any injuries and damages he may have suffered. It was plaintiff's duty on December 11, 2003, to use reasonable care to avoid or minimize risk and possible injury to himself.</blockquote>\n<p>The jury found STRC liable and fixed the plaintiff's damages at $511,886. It then found the plaintiff contributorily negligent and allocated fault sixty percent to him and forty percent to STRC. Accordingly, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for $204,754.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff seasonably renewed his motion for judgment as a matter of law with respect to the contributory negligence defense. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a)-(b). The district court denied the renewed motion, finding sufficient evidence of contributory negligence to support the jury's determination. This timely appeal ensued.</p>\n<p>In this venue, the plaintiff contends that the trial court should not have charged the jury on contributory negligence and that, in all events, the finding of contributory negligence was bereft of any evidentiary foundation. Although these are framed as separate assignments of error, they are for all practical purposes one and the same. The plaintiff's claim of instructional error does not take issue with the form or phrasing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*276</span> of the jury instruction but, rather, posits that the evidence did not warrant giving such an instruction at all. This is exactly the same rationale on which his argument regarding the motion for judgment as a matter of law rests.</p>\n<p>The nature of the applicable standards of review illustrates why, in this instance, we can treat these two claims of error in a single exegesis. We review de novo a decision to instruct the jury on a particular issue, <i>see </i><i>SEC v. Happ,</i> 392 F.3d 12, 28 (1st Cir.2004), asking whether the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the proponent of the instruction, justifies jury consideration of the underlying issue. <i>See </i><i>Levinsky's, Inc. v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,</i> 127 F.3d 122, 135 (1st Cir.1997). Similarly, we review de novo the denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law, <i>Correa,</i> 69 F.3d at 1191, asking whether the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, warrants jury consideration. <i>Zimmerman v. Direct Fed. Credit Union,</i> 262 F.3d 70, 75 (1st Cir.2001). We will not overturn either the lower court's decision to instruct on an issue or its eschewal of judgment as a matter of law unless, at a bare minimum, the record reveals an insufficient evidentiary basis for the decision. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Davis v. Rennie,</i> 264 F.3d 86, 108-09 (1st Cir.2001) (jury instruction); <i>Zimmerman,</i> 262 F.3d at 75 (judgment as a matter of law).</p>\n<p>Here, the congruence of these standards is patent. In the last analysis, each claim of error depends on a showing that the record contains an insufficient evidentiary predicate to justify jury consideration of the contributory negligence defense. Thus, for ease in exposition, we proceed to discuss both claims of error under the carapace of the claim of instructional error.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Evaluation of that claim starts with the statutory scheme. FELA creates a federal cause of action for injured workers in the railroad industry. 45 U.S.C. § 51. Congress has specified the rudiments of the right of action in the statute itself. Those rudiments include a low threshold for proving fault on the employer's part (and, thus, a low threshold for liability). <i>See id.; </i><i>Stevens v. Bangor &amp; Aroostook R.R. Co.,</i> 97 F.3d 594, 597-98 (1st Cir. 1996). Contributory negligence is available as a defense. 45 U.S.C. § 53. It is not a complete bar to a plaintiff's recovery but, rather, operates to diminish the recovery in proportion to the parties' comparative fault. <i>See id.; </i><i>Norfolk S. Ry. Co. v. Sorrell,</i> 549 U.S. 158, 168, 127 S.Ct. 799, 166 L.Ed.2d 638 (2007). Congress has not spelled out the dimensions of the defense, so courts must hew to its common law formulation. <i>See </i><i>Sorrell,</i> 549 U.S. at 168, 171, 127 S.Ct. 799; <i>see also </i><i>Jacobson v. N.Y., New Haven &amp; Hartford R.R. Co.,</i> 206 F.2d 153, 155 (1st Cir.1953) (explaining that when FELA does not specifically provide otherwise, concepts like negligence and contributory negligence may be fleshed out from federal common law).</p>\n<p>An employer in a FELA case, like a prototypical defendant at common law, has the burden of proving the plaintiff's contributory negligence. <i>Sorrell,</i> 549 U.S. at 171, 127 S.Ct. 799, 166 L.Ed.2d 638. To do so, the employer must show that \"the plaintiff's own negligence played a part in causing the injury.\" <i>Hopkins v. Jordan Marine, Inc.,</i> 271 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.2001);<sup>[2]</sup><i>accord </i><i>Wright v. Ark. &amp; Mo.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*277</span> <i>R.R. Co.,</i> 574 F.3d 612, 616-17 (8th Cir. 2009). An employer who has asserted a defense of contributory negligence in a FELA case is entitled to a jury instruction on that defense as long as the record contains some evidence from which contributory negligence can be inferred. <i>See </i><i>Harris v. Ill. Cent. R.R. Co.,</i> 58 F.3d 1140, 1144 (6th Cir.1995); <i>Wise v. Union Pac. R.R.,</i> 815 F.2d 55, 57 (8th Cir.1987); <i>see also </i><i>Wilson v. Mar. Overseas Corp.,</i> 150 F.3d 1, 11-12 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n<p>In this case, the plaintiff's theory of liability related to STRC's failure to provide him with proper equipment when it assigned him, in icy conditions, to repair the tracks. The jury found STRC liable, and that finding is not challenged on appeal. Thus, the lens of our inquiry narrows to focus on the jury's finding of contributory negligence and, more specifically, the propriety vel non of allowing the jury to decide that issue. This, in turn, hinges on whether the jury supportably could have found that the plaintiff's acts or omissions played a part in bringing about his injuries.</p>\n<p>The record makes manifest that the plaintiff did not wear ice creepers on the day in question and that, in the opinion of some, wearing them would have made the workplace safer. The record makes equally clear that the plaintiff did not wear ice creepers because the ones that STRC had furnished him were no longer usable. The jury heard contradictory evidence (or, at least, evidence from which contradictory inferences could be drawn) about why the plaintiff was without usable ice creepers at that time. Viewing the evidence as a whole, we think that the jury reasonably could have found either that the plaintiff failed to request new ice creepers or, at least, that he did not request them in a timeous manner. Relatedly, the jury could have found that STRC had ice creepers on hand and available for the asking. Findings of this sort would have supported a plausible conclusion that the plaintiff was, in part, the author of his own misfortune. Where, as here, there is room for a jury to choose among competing, record-rooted inferences, there is no basis for taking the issue from the jury. <i>See </i><i>Hopkins,</i> 271 F.3d at 3-4; <i>Wilson,</i> 150 F.3d at 12. There was, therefore, no error in instructing the jury on the issue of contributory negligence.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff musters a trio of counter-arguments aimed at blunting the force of this reasoning. We examine these counter-arguments sequentially.</p>\n<p>First, the plaintiff contends that, by means of its opening statement and its summation, STRC admitted that he (the plaintiff) was not negligent (and, thus, foreclosed jury consideration of that issue). This contention comprises more cry than wool.</p>\n<p>We begin with first principles. Counsel can make admissions during trial that will bind the client. <i>Levinsky's, Inc.,</i> 127 F.3d at 134. Such admissions can be derived from the contents of opening statements or closing arguments. <i>Id.</i> In order to qualify as an admission under this rubric, such a statement, when viewed in context, must be clear and unambiguous. <i>Id.; see also </i><i>Best v. District of Columbia,</i> 291 U.S. 411, 415-16, 54 S.Ct. 487, 78 L.Ed. 882 (1934) (cautioning that counsel's opening statement will not qualify as an admission unless the supposedly admitted fact \"clearly appear[s]\" beyond all doubt to have been admitted).</p>\n<p>In both his opening statement and his closing argument, STRC's lawyer leaned heavily on the theory that STRC should not be held liable because the December 11 incident, though unfortunate, was merely an accident that occurred without fault on anyone's part. But the lawyer did not in either instance put all his client's eggs <span class=\"star-pagination\">*278</span> in this one forensic basket. This multifaceted approach is particularly evident in his summation, where he pointed out conflicts in the evidence anent the availability of ice creepers and whether the plaintiff had requested new ones.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff nonetheless asserts that, when all was said and done, STRC's attorney should be deemed to have admitted that he (the plaintiff) was free from fault. In examining this assertion, we think it useful to address the opening and closing separately. We start with the opening statement.</p>\n<p>STRC's counsel told the jury that the proof would likely show that what had happened was \"nobody's fault.\" He called the event an \"accident\" and did not mention contributory negligence as such. But this is at most suggestive; the lawyer also pointed the jury to anticipated evidence about the supply of ice creepers on hand and the uncertainty about whether the plaintiff had made a request to replace his dilapidated ice creepers. Given these comments, we do not believe that the opening statement fairly can be said to constitute a clear and unambiguous admission that the plaintiff was free from fault.</p>\n<p>This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the plaintiff did not <i>at that point</i> move to take the issue of contributory negligence from the jury. <i>Cf. </i><i>Franchi Constr. Co. v. Combined Ins. Co.,</i> 580 F.2d 1, 8 (1st Cir.1978) (noting trial court's power to direct verdict immediately following plaintiff's opening statement); <i>Slotnick v. Staviskey,</i> 560 F.2d 31, 32-34 (1st Cir. 1977) (affirming directed verdict based on opening statement). Rather, the opening statement ended; the trial went forward; and STRC, through both cross-examination and the proffer of its own witnesses, introduced evidence relating to the degree of care exercised by the plaintiff. Had the opening statement contained a clear and unambiguous admission that the plaintiff was not guilty of contributory negligence, it is likely that the case would have proceeded quite differently.</p>\n<p>In his summation, STRC's lawyer argued that he \"felt this was just an accident that happened on one day. [The plaintiff] lost his footing, as he said in his own report. . . .\" Once again, there was no contemporaneous claim by the plaintiff that the summation constituted an admission relative to contributory negligence and for good reason. Having studied the closing argument in its entirety, we are unable to find a clear and unambiguous concession anent the plaintiffs due care.</p>\n<p>Taken in context, the references to an \"accident\" were a tactic designed to persuade the jury that STRC's conduct was not a cause-in-fact of the plaintiff's injury. The speaker did not exclude other possibilities but, indeed, pointed out discrepancies in the evidence pertaining to whether the plaintiff had requested ice creepers and reminded the jury about testimony attesting to the ready availability of an adequate supply of ice creepers. Those allusions would have been senseless had the absence of contributory negligence been admitted.</p>\n<p>We conclude, without serious question, that contributory negligence was a live issue, admitted neither during STRC's opening statement nor during its closing argument. The mere fact that a party's counsel, in addressing the jury, chooses to emphasize one theory of the case does not, in and of itself, operate to waive the party's other defenses. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Haines v. Risley,</i> 412 F.3d 285, 289-90 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Levinsky's, Inc.,</i> 127 F.3d at 134-35.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff next strives to convince us that the district court erroneously employed a \"cookie cutter\" approach to instructing the jury; that is, that the court believed that contributory negligence was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*279</span> an issue for the jury in every slip-and-fall case, regardless of the proof. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p>To be sure, the trial court did say at one point that it typically instructed on contributory negligence in slip-and-fall cases. Be that as it may, the argument that the court applied a mechanical rule is a non-starter. The evidence <i>in this case,</i> viewed in the light most favorable to the proponent of the defense, warranted an instruction on contributory negligence. Thus, there was no reversible error here.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff's last argument is textual.<sup>[3]</sup> It proceeds from the premise that the district court instructed the jury to evaluate the plaintiff's conduct on December 11, 2003, and not otherwise. Because no one introduced evidence of negligent conduct by the plaintiff on that day, the argument goes, any finding of contributory negligence must have been a camouflaged finding of assumption of the risk. This would imply error because assumption of risk, unlike contributory negligence, is not cognizable as a defense in FELA cases. <i>See</i> 45 U.S.C. § 54.</p>\n<p>At common law, the distinction between assumption of the risk and contributory negligence is well-settled. Assumption of the risk arises out of the knowing and voluntary acceptance of a dangerous condition. <i>See </i><i>Seaboard Air Line Ry. v. Horton,</i> 233 U.S. 492, 504-05, 34 S.Ct. 635, 58 L.Ed. 1062 (1914); <i>Hopkins,</i> 271 F.3d at 3-4; <i>see also</i> Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 496A, 496D (1965). In contrast, contributory negligence arises out of any \"careless act or omission on the plaintiff's part tending to add new dangers to [existing] conditions.\" <i>Taylor v. Burlington N. R.R. Co.,</i> 787 F.2d 1309, 1316 (9th Cir.1986); <i>see also </i><i>Seaboard Air Line Ry.,</i> 233 U.S. at 503-04, 34 S.Ct. 635 (defining contributory negligence as a failure by the plaintiff to use ordinary care).</p>\n<p>On this record, we do not think it can be said that the jury conflated these two concepts. Although the district court told the jury that \"[i]t was plaintiff's duty <i>on December 11, 2003,</i> to use reasonable care to avoid or minimize . . . possible injury to himself\" (emphasis supplied), it makes no sense to read that phrase in isolation and treat it as a circumscription of the issue of contributory negligence. Jury instructions must be reviewed contextually. An inquiring court should look at the charge as a whole and give the words used to convey the judge's message a common-sense interpretation. <i>See </i><i>Ellis v. United States,</i> 313 F.3d 636, 645 (1st Cir. 2002); <i>Elliott v. S.D. Warren Co.,</i> 134 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.1998); <i>see also </i><i>Hopkins,</i> 271 F.3d at 4 (stating that \"the test of jury instructions is not abstract perfection\").</p>\n<p>In the case at hand, the jury heard a great deal of testimony about the process for ensuring that track-repair workers had ice creepers, the availability of replacement ice creepers, the condition of the plaintiff's ice creepers, and when the plaintiff requested new ones. This evidence framed the extent to which the plaintiff's acts and omissions were put in issue. The jury was instructed in broad terms, quoted <i>supra,</i> to consider the plaintiff's part (if any) in causing the accident.</p>\n<p>It is also worth noting that the district court put the non-issue of assumption of the risk off limits. The court warned the jury against reducing the plaintiff's recovery based on assumption of the risk, stating:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*280</span> Keep in mind also that even though an employee such as plaintiff may know that the railroad has been negligent in failing to furnish him with necessary equipment such as properly functioning ice creepers, he does not, merely by continuing to perform his job, act negligently himself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . . Contributory negligence may arise only from plaintiff's own act or acts of negligence, not from knowingly taking on a risk inherent in the work environment or a risk created by defendant's negligence.</blockquote>\n<p>Given these facts, the context of the trial does not lend itself to the notion that the charge limited the jury's consideration of the plaintiff's due care to the day of the accident. The court's date-specific allusion represented an attemptalbeit an awkward attemptto focus the jury's attention on the circumstances leading up to the fall. Fairly read, the charge did not direct the jury to play the ostrich and ignore the copious evidence of plaintiff's earlier acts and omissions that formed the basis for STRC's contributory negligence defense.</p>\n<p>We need go no further. The plaintiff's claim of instructional error fails. That conclusion requires us, for reasons already stated, to uphold as well the denial of the plaintiff's motion for judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  There is one exception, <i>see infra</i> note 3 and accompanying text, but that is not a matter of any consequence.</p>\n<p>[2]  <i>Hopkins</i> is a Jones Act case, but the Jones Act incorporates the relevant provisions of the FELA by reference. <i>See</i> 46 U.S.C. § 30104.

The jury found the defendant negligent but reduced the award of damages substantially based on a finding of contributory negligence. The plaintiff appeals, posing claims of both instructional error and evidentiary insufficiency. In the end, however, all roads lead to Rome, and a single exegesis suffices to show that the record contains evidence adequate to permit jury consideration of the disputed issue (thus defeating the claim of instructional error) and to ground a finding on that issue (thus defeating the claim of evidentiary insufficiency). Accordingly, we answer both questions at one fell swoop and affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p>We rehearse the facts as the jury could have found them, mindful that \"when the losing party protests the sufficiency of the evidence, the court of appeals must take both the facts and the reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most hospitable to the jury's verdict.\" <i>Correa v. Hosp. San Francisco,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196369\"><a href=\"/opinion/196369/correa-gonzalez-v-hospital-sf/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1184</span></a></span>, 1188 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n<p>Defendant-appellee Springfield Terminal Railway Co. (STRC), an employer subject to the FELA, employed plaintiff-appellant Donald J. Butynski for nearly a quarter of a century as a trackman. The plaintiff's base of operations was the STRC rail yard in East Deerfield, Massachusetts, but his job description called for him to work as needed along the STRC's rail lines throughout western Massachusetts.</p>\n<p>On December 11, 2003, while part of a crew assigned to repair tracks in Otter River, the plaintiff slipped and fell. In trying to break his fall, he fractured his wrist. His injuries were disabling and spelled the end of his career with STRC.</p>\n<p>For some two weeks before the plaintiff's fall, Otter River had experienced rain, snow, and frigid temperatures. On the day of the incident, the work site was icy (and, therefore, slippery). That condition was open and obvious.</p>\n<p>In the winter, icy conditions are common fare on the STRC's lines. For that reason, STRC routinely furnishes its track-repair personnel with ice creeperssafety devices, capable of being strapped to work boots, which contain embedded metal cleats designed to improve the wearer's footing on snow and ice. Ice creepers are generally sturdy, and once STRC furnishes a pair to a trackman, there is no set schedule for periodic replenishment. If the trackman needs new ice creepers because his are worn out or lost, it is his responsibility to request replacements.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*275</span> The plaintiff's foreman testified that, given the slippery conditions, wearing ice creepers was an appropriate safety measure at the time and place of the incident. Nevertheless, the plaintiff did not don ice creepers that day because his were stretched out and no longer fit properly. He admitted that he knew, months earlier, that his ice creepers were shot. He said that he unsuccessfully requested replacements on approximately four occasions during the fall of 2003. His foreman confirmed that the plaintiff had asked for new ice creepers.</p>\n<p>STRC denied that any such requests had been made. Various supervisory personnel at the rail yard testified that they could not recall the plaintiff either complaining about the condition of his ice creepers or seeking new ones. The railroad had no record of any such request.</p>\n<p>Relatedly, there was no shortage of ice creepers in stock during 2003. For example, one supervisor testified that, prior to December 11, the rail yard had received seventy-eight pairs of ice creepers (some large and some extra-large) and that ice creepers were in adequate supply. STRC's witnesses stated that ice creepers were typically available upon request and, in the event that ice creepers were not immediately on hand to satisfy a request, new ones normally would be provided within a week.</p>\n<p>In its answer to the complaint, STRC denied liability and pleaded contributory negligence as an affirmative defense. Consistent with this pleading, it advised the court in a pretrial submission that it would press for a jury instruction on that issue. At the close of all the evidence, STRC reaffirmed that it desired an instruction on this defense. The plaintiff objected to any instruction on contributory negligence and moved for judgment as a matter of law with respect to that issue. The district court viewed contributory negligence as a live controversy and therefore denied the motion for judgment as a matter of law. Then, over the plaintiff's objection, the court instructed the jury, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote>Contributory negligence is fault on the part of the person injured, which cooperates in some degree with the negligence of another, and so helps to bring about the injury. By the defense of contributory negligence, defendant in effect alleges that, even if defendant's negligence was one of the causes of plaintiff's injuries, plaintiff himself, by his own failure to use ordinary care under the circumstances for his own safety, also contributed one of the causes of any injuries and damages he may have suffered. It was plaintiff's duty on December 11, 2003, to use reasonable care to avoid or minimize risk and possible injury to himself.</blockquote>\n<p>The jury found STRC liable and fixed the plaintiff's damages at $511,886. It then found the plaintiff contributorily negligent and allocated fault sixty percent to him and forty percent to STRC. Accordingly, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for $204,754.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff seasonably renewed his motion for judgment as a matter of law with respect to the contributory negligence defense. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a)-(b). The district court denied the renewed motion, finding sufficient evidence of contributory negligence to support the jury's determination. This timely appeal ensued.</p>\n<p>In this venue, the plaintiff contends that the trial court should not have charged the jury on contributory negligence and that, in all events, the finding of contributory negligence was bereft of any evidentiary foundation. Although these are framed as separate assignments of error, they are for all practical purposes one and the same. The plaintiff's claim of instructional error does not take issue with the form or phrasing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*276</span> of the jury instruction but, rather, posits that the evidence did not warrant giving such an instruction at all. This is exactly the same rationale on which his argument regarding the motion for judgment as a matter of law rests.</p>\n<p>The nature of the applicable standards of review illustrates why, in this instance, we can treat these two claims of error in a single exegesis. We review de novo a decision to instruct the jury on a particular issue, <i>see </i><i>SEC v. Happ,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202466\"><a href=\"/opinion/202466/sec-v-happ/\"><span class=\"volume\">392</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 28 (1st Cir.2004), asking whether the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the proponent of the instruction, justifies jury consideration of the underlying issue. <i>See </i><i>Levinsky's, Inc. v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197576\"><a href=\"/opinion/197576/levinskys-inc-v-wal-mart-stores/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">122</span></a></span>, 135 (1st Cir.1997). Similarly, we review de novo the denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law, <i>Correa,</i> 69 F.3d at 1191, asking whether the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, warrants jury consideration. <i>Zimmerman v. Direct Fed. Credit Union,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774578\"><a href=\"/opinion/774578/celia-g-zimmerman-v-direct-federal-credit-union-and-david-breslin/\"><span class=\"volume\">262</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span>, 75 (1st Cir.2001). We will not overturn either the lower court's decision to instruct on an issue or its eschewal of judgment as a matter of law unless, at a bare minimum, the record reveals an insufficient evidentiary basis for the decision. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Davis v. Rennie,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199586\"><a href=\"/opinion/199586/davis-v-rennie/\"><span class=\"volume\">264</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span>, 108-09 (1st Cir.2001) (jury instruction); <i>Zimmerman,</i> 262 F.3d at 75 (judgment as a matter of law).</p>\n<p>Here, the congruence of these standards is patent. In the last analysis, each claim of error depends on a showing that the record contains an insufficient evidentiary predicate to justify jury consideration of the contributory negligence defense. Thus, for ease in exposition, we proceed to discuss both claims of error under the carapace of the claim of instructional error.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Evaluation of that claim starts with the statutory scheme. FELA creates a federal cause of action for injured workers in the railroad industry. 45 U.S.C. § 51. Congress has specified the rudiments of the right of action in the statute itself. Those rudiments include a low threshold for proving fault on the employer's part (and, thus, a low threshold for liability). <i>See id.; </i><i>Stevens v. Bangor &amp; Aroostook R.R. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197005\"><a href=\"/opinion/197005/stevens-v-bangor-and-aroostook/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">594</span></a></span>, 597-98 (1st Cir. 1996). Contributory negligence is available as a defense. 45 U.S.C. § 53. It is not a complete bar to a plaintiff's recovery but, rather, operates to diminish the recovery in proportion to the parties' comparative fault. <i>See id.; </i><i>Norfolk S. Ry. Co. v. Sorrell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145765\"><a href=\"/opinion/145765/norfolk-southern-ry-co-v-sorrell/\"><span class=\"volume\">549</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">158</span></a></span>, 168, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145765\"><a href=\"/opinion/145765/norfolk-southern-ry-co-v-sorrell/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

An employer who has asserted a defense of contributory negligence in a FELA case is entitled to a jury instruction on that defense as long as the record contains some evidence from which contributory negligence can be inferred. <i>See </i><i>Harris v.

The jury found STRC liable, and that finding is not challenged on appeal. Thus, the lens of our inquiry narrows to focus on the jury's finding of contributory negligence and, more specifically, the propriety vel non of allowing the jury to decide that issue. This, in turn, hinges on whether the jury supportably could have found that the plaintiff's acts or omissions played a part in bringing about his injuries.</p>\n<p>The record makes manifest that the plaintiff did not wear ice creepers on the day in question and that, in the opinion of some, wearing them would have made the workplace safer. The record makes equally clear that the plaintiff did not wear ice creepers because the ones that STRC had furnished him were no longer usable. The jury heard contradictory evidence (or, at least, evidence from which contradictory inferences could be drawn) about why the plaintiff was without usable ice creepers at that time. Viewing the evidence as a whole, we think that the jury reasonably could have found either that the plaintiff failed to request new ice creepers or, at least, that he did not request them in a timeous manner. Relatedly, the jury could have found that STRC had ice creepers on hand and available for the asking. Findings of this sort would have supported a plausible conclusion that the plaintiff was, in part, the author of his own misfortune. Where, as here, there is room for a jury to choose among competing, record-rooted inferences, there is no basis for taking the issue from the jury. <i>See </i><i>Hopkins,</i> 271 F.3d at 3-4; <i>Wilson,</i> 150 F.3d at 12. There was, therefore, no error in instructing the jury on the issue of contributory negligence.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff musters a trio of counter-arguments aimed at blunting the force of this reasoning. We examine these counter-arguments sequentially.</p>\n<p>First, the plaintiff contends that, by means of its opening statement and its summation, STRC admitted that he (the plaintiff) was not negligent (and, thus, foreclosed jury consideration of that issue). This contention comprises more cry than wool.</p>\n<p>We begin with first principles. Counsel can make admissions during trial that will bind the client. <i>Levinsky's, Inc.,</i> 127 F.3d at 134. Such admissions can be derived from the contents of opening statements or closing arguments. <i>Id.</i> In order to qualify as an admission under this rubric, such a statement, when viewed in context, must be clear and unambiguous. <i>Id.; see also </i><i>Best v. District of Columbia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102213\"><a href=\"/opinion/102213/best-v-district-of-columbia/\"><span class=\"volume\">291</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">411</span></a></span>, 415-16, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">487</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">882</span></span> (1934) (cautioning that counsel's opening statement will not qualify as an admission unless the supposedly admitted fact \"clearly appear[s]\" beyond all doubt to have been admitted).</p>\n<p>In both his opening statement and his closing argument, STRC's lawyer leaned heavily on the theory that STRC should not be held liable because the December 11 incident, though unfortunate, was merely an accident that occurred without fault on anyone's part. But the lawyer did not in either instance put all his client's eggs <span class=\"star-pagination\">*278</span> in this one forensic basket. This multifaceted approach is particularly evident in his summation, where he pointed out conflicts in the evidence anent the availability of ice creepers and whether the plaintiff had requested new ones.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff nonetheless asserts that, when all was said and done, STRC's attorney should be deemed to have admitted that he (the plaintiff) was free from fault. In examining this assertion, we think it useful to address the opening and closing separately. We start with the opening statement.</p>\n<p>STRC's counsel told the jury that the proof would likely show that what had happened was \"nobody's fault.\" He called the event an \"accident\" and did not mention contributory negligence as such. But this is at most suggestive; the lawyer also pointed the jury to anticipated evidence about the supply of ice creepers on hand and the uncertainty about whether the plaintiff had made a request to replace his dilapidated ice creepers. Given these comments, we do not believe that the opening statement fairly can be said to constitute a clear and unambiguous admission that the plaintiff was free from fault.</p>\n<p>This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the plaintiff did not <i>at that point</i> move to take the issue of contributory negligence from the jury. <i>Cf. </i><i>Franchi Constr. Co. v. Combined Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"358146\"><a href=\"/opinion/358146/franchi-construction-co-inc-v-combined-insurance-company-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">580</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir.1978) (noting trial court's power to direct verdict immediately following plaintiff's opening statement); <i>Slotnick v. Staviskey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"348311\"><a href=\"/opinion/348311/lester-slotnick-v-harold-staviskey/\"><span class=\"volume\">560</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span>, 32-34 (1st Cir. 1977) (affirming directed verdict based on opening statement). Rather, the opening statement ended; the trial went forward; and STRC, through both cross-examination and the proffer of its own witnesses, introduced evidence relating to the degree of care exercised by the plaintiff. Had the opening statement contained a clear and unambiguous admission that the plaintiff was not guilty of contributory negligence, it is likely that the case would have proceeded quite differently.</p>\n<p>In his summation, STRC's lawyer argued that he \"felt this was just an accident that happened on one day. [The plaintiff] lost his footing, as he said in his own report. . . .\" Once again, there was no contemporaneous claim by the plaintiff that the summation constituted an admission relative to contributory negligence and for good reason. Having studied the closing argument in its entirety, we are unable to find a clear and unambiguous concession anent the plaintiffs due care.</p>\n<p>Taken in context, the references to an \"accident\" were a tactic designed to persuade the jury that STRC's conduct was not a cause-in-fact of the plaintiff's injury. The speaker did not exclude other possibilities but, indeed, pointed out discrepancies in the evidence pertaining to whether the plaintiff had requested ice creepers and reminded the jury about testimony attesting to the ready availability of an adequate supply of ice creepers. Those allusions would have been senseless had the absence of contributory negligence been admitted.</p>\n<p>We conclude, without serious question, that contributory negligence was a live issue, admitted neither during STRC's opening statement nor during its closing argument. The mere fact that a party's counsel, in addressing the jury, chooses to emphasize one theory of the case does not, in and of itself, operate to waive the party's other defenses. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Haines v. Risley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201652\"><a href=\"/opinion/201652/haines-v-risley/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">285</span></a></span>, 289-90 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Levinsky's, Inc.,</i> 127 F.3d at 134-35.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff next strives to convince us that the district court erroneously employed a \"cookie cutter\" approach to instructing the jury; that is, that the court believed that contributory negligence was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*279</span> an issue for the jury in every slip-and-fall case, regardless of the proof. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p>To be sure, the trial court did say at one point that it typically instructed on contributory negligence in slip-and-fall cases. Be that as it may, the argument that the court applied a mechanical rule is a non-starter. The evidence <i>in this case,</i> viewed in the light most favorable to the proponent of the defense, warranted an instruction on contributory negligence. Thus, there was no reversible error here.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff's last argument is textual.<sup>[3]</sup> It proceeds from the premise that the district court instructed the jury to evaluate the plaintiff's conduct on December 11, 2003, and not otherwise. Because no one introduced evidence of negligent conduct by the plaintiff on that day, the argument goes, any finding of contributory negligence must have been a camouflaged finding of assumption of the risk. This would imply error because assumption of risk, unlike contributory negligence, is not cognizable as a defense in FELA cases. <i>See</i> 45 U.S.C. § 54.</p>\n<p>At common law, the distinction between assumption of the risk and contributory negligence is well-settled. Assumption of the risk arises out of the knowing and voluntary acceptance of a dangerous condition. <i>See </i><i>Seaboard Air Line Ry. v. Horton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"98173\"><a href=\"/opinion/98173/seaboard-air-line-r-co-v-horton/\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></a></span>, 504-05, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1062</span></span> (1914); <i>Hopkins,</i> 271 F.3d at 3-4; <i>see also</i> Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 496A, 496D (1965). In contrast, contributory negligence arises out of any \"careless act or omission on the plaintiff's part tending to add new dangers to [existing] conditions.\" <i>Taylor v. Burlington N. R.R. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"468194\"><a href=\"/opinion/468194/stanley-f-taylor-v-burlington-northern-railroad-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">787</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1309</span></a></span>, 1316 (9th Cir.1986); <i>see also </i><i>Seaboard Air Line Ry.,</i> 233 U.S. at 503-04, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">635</span></span> (defining contributory negligence as a failure by the plaintiff to use ordinary care).</p>\n<p>On this record, we do not think it can be said that the jury conflated these two concepts. Although the district court told the jury that \"[i]t was plaintiff's duty <i>on December 11, 2003,</i> to use reasonable care to avoid or minimize . . . possible injury to himself\" (emphasis supplied), it makes no sense to read that phrase in isolation and treat it as a circumscription of the issue of contributory negligence. Jury instructions must be reviewed contextually. An inquiring court should look at the charge as a whole and give the words used to convey the judge's message a common-sense interpretation. <i>See </i><i>Ellis v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200248\"><a href=\"/opinion/200248/ellis-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">313</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">636</span></a></span>, 645 (1st Cir. 2002); <i>Elliott v. S.D. Warren Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"750688\"><a href=\"/opinion/750688/darryl-w-elliott-v-sd-warren-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir.1998); <i>see also </i><i>Hopkins,</i> 271 F.3d at 4 (stating that \"the test of jury instructions is not abstract perfection\").</p>\n<p>In the case at hand, the jury heard a great deal of testimony about the process for ensuring that track-repair workers had ice creepers, the availability of replacement ice creepers, the condition of the plaintiff's ice creepers, and when the plaintiff requested new ones. This evidence framed the extent to which the plaintiff's acts and omissions were put in issue. The jury was instructed in broad terms, quoted <i>supra,</i> to consider the plaintiff's part (if any) in causing the accident.</p>\n<p>It is also worth noting that the district court put the non-issue of assumption of the risk off limits. The court warned the jury against reducing the plaintiff's recovery based on assumption of the risk, stating:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*280</span> Keep in mind also that even though an employee such as plaintiff may know that the railroad has been negligent in failing to furnish him with necessary equipment such as properly functioning ice creepers, he does not, merely by continuing to perform his job, act negligently himself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . . Contributory negligence may arise only from plaintiff's own act or acts of negligence, not from knowingly taking on a risk inherent in the work environment or a risk created by defendant's negligence.</blockquote>\n<p>Given these facts, the context of the trial does not lend itself to the notion that the charge limited the jury's consideration of the plaintiff's due care to the day of the accident. The court's date-specific allusion represented an attemptalbeit an awkward attemptto focus the jury's attention on the circumstances leading up to the fall. Fairly read, the charge did not direct the jury to play the ostrich and ignore the copious evidence of plaintiff's earlier acts and omissions that formed the basis for STRC's contributory negligence defense.</p>\n<p>We need go no further. The plaintiff's claim of instructional error fails. That conclusion requires us, for reasons already stated, to uphold as well the denial of the plaintiff's motion for judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  There is one exception, <i>see infra</i> note 3 and accompanying text, but that is not a matter of any consequence.</p>\n<p>[2]  <i>Hopkins</i> is a Jones Act case, but the Jones Act incorporates the relevant provisions of the FELA by reference. <i>See</i> 46 U.S.C. § 30104. Thus, precedent under the Jones Act is deemed instructive in FELA cases, and vice versa. <i>See </i><i>Ellenwood v. Exxon Shipping Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599255\"><a href=\"/opinion/599255/theodore-m-ellenwood-v-exxon-shipping-co-state-of-maine-intervenor/\"><span class=\"volume\">984</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1270</span></a></span>, 1281 n. 15 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n<p>[3]  Technically speaking, this argument is not a claim of instructional error but, rather, a pure claim of evidentiary insufficiency.</p>\n\n</div>",
