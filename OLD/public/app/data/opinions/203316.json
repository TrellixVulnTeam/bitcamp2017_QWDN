Vera-Ramírez and Landrón & Vera, LLP\nwere on brief for defendants, appellants.\n     Nora Vargas-Acosta with whom Wilma E. Reverón-Collazo was on\nbrief for appellees.\n\n\n\n                          June 5, 2008\n\f             BOUDIN, Chief Judge.     Plaintiff (\"Mario\"1)--a minor who\n\nsuffers   from   cerebral   palsy   among   other   disabilities--received\n\nhomebound educational services from the Puerto Rico Department of\n\nEducation.   In September 2001, Mario's grandmother began to suspect\n\nthat he was being physically and sexually abused by his teacher,\n\nEdgar Rivera-Lugo. After further investigation, Mario's family filed\n\na complaint with the police. Rivera-Lugo was arrested and, following\n\na bench trial, was found guilty of misdemeanor aggravated assault and\n\ninstitutional abuse.\n\n             Mario, together with his parents and grandmother, then\n\nfiled suit in federal district court based on the abuse he suffered\n\nand the alleged deprivation of educational services in the year-long\n\nperiod following Rivera-Lugo's termination.          The defendants named\n\nwere Rivera-Lugo in his official and individual capacities; Elizabeth\n\nOrtega, regional supervisor of special education, in her official and\n\nindividual capacities; the Commonwealth Secretary of Education in his\n\nofficial capacity; and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n\n             Although the complaint is not crystal clear as to which\n\nclaims were asserted against which defendants, it did identify as\n\nbases for relief Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act\n\n(\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 12132 (2000); section 504 of the Rehabilitation\n\nAct, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (2000); Title IX of the Education Amendments of\n\n\n     1\n      The child, age eight at the time of the incidents, is referred\nto in the briefs by his initials; we use one of his given names in\nthis decision.\n\n                                    -3-\n\f1972, 20 U.S.C §§ 1681-88 (2000); section 1983, 42 U.S.C. § 1983; and\n\nvarious   provisions    of   Puerto    Rico   law.      The   complaint     sought\n\ncompensatory damages of $5 million, punitive damages against each\n\ndefendant and injunctive relief.\n\n             Following various motions and orders,2 defendants Ortega,\n\nthe Secretary of Education, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\n\nsought summary judgment on the federal claims. They argued that they\n\nwere unaware of Rivera-Lugo's abusive behavior and that when they\n\nlearned     of   it   they   took     immediate      action   to   remove     him.\n\nAlternatively, they argued that they are shielded by qualified\n\nimmunity (as to Ortega in her individual capacity) or sovereign\n\nimmunity (for the Commonwealth and the defendants sued in their\n\nofficial capacities).\n\n             The magistrate judge, presiding with the consent of the\n\nparties, granted summary judgment in part, finding that Rivera-Lugo's\n\nsupervisors did not participate in or act recklessly with regard to\n\nRivera-Lugo's misconduct.      However, the magistrate judge found that\n\nmaterial disputes of fact remained regarding defendants' actions\n\nfollowing    Rivera-Lugo's    termination,     primarily      claims   that    the\n\ndefendants had retaliated against Mario for complaining to the\n\n\n     2\n      The Commonwealth initially sought dismissal on sovereign\nimmunity grounds and ultimately obtained dismissal only of section\n1983 claims on this ground. Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment\nagainst Rivera-Lugo, arguing that his criminal conviction established\nhis civil liability; the district court granted the motion as to\nplaintiffs' physical abuse claims, but denied it as to the sexual\nabuse claims.\n\n                                       -4-\n\fpolice; and the court denied defendants' immunity defenses as to such\n\nclaims.     The abuse claims therefore remain pending only against\n\nRivera-Lugo.\n\n             Defendants other than Rivera-Lugo now appeal, invoking our\n\njurisdiction to review on an interlocutory basis a district court's\n\ndenial of qualified and sovereign immunity defenses.                  Torres v.\n\nPuerto Rico, 485 F.3d 5, 8-9 (1st Cir. 2007).              On appeal we review\n\nlegal rulings de novo.         Asociacion De Subscripcion Conjunta Del\n\nSeguro De Responsabilidad Obligatorio v. Galarza, 484 F.3d 1, 22 (1st\n\nCir. 2007).     The qualified immunity and sovereign immunity claims\n\npresent quite different issues.\n\n             The qualified immunity claim is relevant only to Ortega\n\ninsofar as she was sued for damages in her individual capacity.\n\nQualified     immunity   is    not     available     to     the    Commonwealth,\n\nNereida-Gonzalez v. Tirado-Delgado, 990 F.2d 701, 705 (1st Cir.\n\n1993), nor to the Secretary of Education because he was sued only in\n\nhis official capacity, and qualified immunity does not apply to\n\nofficial capacity claims, usually aimed at injunctive relief based on\n\nEx parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 159-60 (1908).              See Nereida-Gonzalez,\n\n990 F.2d at 705.\n\n             Plaintiffs' brief on appeal says that the only damages\n\nclaim   asserted   against    Ortega   was   under   section      1983;   and   the\n\ngravamen of this claim after the summary judgment ruling appears to\n\nbe that Ortega retaliated against plaintiffs in violation of their\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\ffirst amendment rights by denying Mario educational services after\n\nhis family complained to the police.                    This would arguably be a\n\nlegitimate        claim   under   section      1983,    if    it   could   be   factually\n\nsupported, Powell v. Alexander, 391 F.3d 1, 16-17 (1st Cir. 2004);\n\nand such a claim was preserved (although not emphasized) by the\n\ncomplaint.3\n\n                 In addition to the first amendment claim, the magistrate\n\njudge also deemed preserved against Ortega a separate claim based on\n\nthe same denial of services after Rivera-Lugo's termination.                        This\n\nappears to be based on the theory that the denial of services was\n\n\"discriminatory\"--possibly on an equal protection theory.                         We can\n\nfind       no   reference   to    any   such    claim    in    the   complaint     or   in\n\nplaintiffs' opposition to summary judgment.                   We conclude that it was\n\nnot presented and so think it must be disregarded.\n\n                 Turning, then, to the retaliation claim against Ortega,\n\nthe evidentiary basis for such a claim is invisible to us.                       Although\n\nmuch time passed after Rivera-Lugo was arrested before Mario got new\n\nadequate home services, the defendants' motion for summary judgment\n\n\n       3\n       Section 1983 cannot be used as a vehicle for ADA or other\nstatutory claims that provide their own frameworks for damages. See\nFitzgerald v. Barnstable Sch. Comm., 504 F.3d 165, 178-79 (1st Cir.\n2007), petition for cert. filed, No. 07-1125 (Mar. 3, 2008) (no\nsection 1983 action against school official premised on violation of\nTitle IX); A.W. v. Jersey City Pub. Sch., 486 F.3d 791, 803-06 (3d\nCir. 2007) (no section 1983 action against official for violation of\nRehabilitation Act); Holbrook v. City of Alpharetta, 112 F.3d 1522,\n1531 (11th Cir. 1997) (no section 1983 action against official for\nviolation of ADA or Rehabilitation Act).\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\fpointed to substantial evidence in the record developed in the\n\ndiscovery process indicating that resource problems and bureaucratic\n\ntangle were the explanation for the admittedly long delay.\n\n              In opposing summary judgment on the retaliation claim,\n\nthe plaintiffs baldly asserted that the delay in furnishing services\n\nwas based on retaliatory animus but without citing any evidence in\n\nthe record to support such an assertion. And although the magistrate\n\njudge discussed the motion for summary judgment on the retaliation\n\nclaim, her discussion contains no reference to any such evidence.\n\nHer decision merely states that the plaintiffs' claim of retaliation\n\nraises a disputed issue of material fact.\n\n              Under the case law, an interlocutory appeal is available\n\nto review denials of qualified immunity at the summary judgment stage\n\nonly if based upon an error of law of a kind other than a dispute\n\nabout the adequacy of evidence.         Johnson v. Jones, 515 U.S. 304, 317-\n\n18 (1995); Rodriguez-Rodriguez v. Ortiz-Velez, 391 F.3d 36, 40 (1st\n\nCir. 2004).    The restriction is purely prudential, being designed to\n\navoid the weighing of the evidence at the interlocutory stage.\n\n              Here,   defendants   do    not   dispute   that   under   clearly\n\nestablished law, retaliation could give rise to a first amendment\n\nclaim remediable under section 1983; the only apparent basis for the\n\ndenial seems to be the court's perception of a factual dispute,\n\nnamely, whether there was enough evidence of a retaliatory motive to\n\nsurvive summary judgment.      Since the qualified immunity denial does\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fnot turn on a legal issue, under Johnson we arguably have no\n\nauthority to overturn the ruling on interlocutory review.\n\n               Conceivably, Johnson's limitation could be disregarded on\n\nthe ground that in denying qualified immunity the magistrate judge\n\nmade an error of law in disregarding the need for some evidence of\n\nretaliatory intent for the first amendment claim.                     Cf. Behrens v.\n\nPelletier, 516 U.S. 299, 313 (1996).                 But it would be a stretch to so\n\nconstrue the magistrate judge's decision.                 The cleaner course is for\n\nher    take    a    fresh     look    before    permitting   a   seemingly   hopeless\n\nretaliation claim to proceed to trial\n\n               We turn now to the defendants' claim that, in addition,\n\nsovereign          immunity     defeats        retaliation   claims    against     the\n\nCommonwealth and the official capacity defendants based on three\n\nother statutes: the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act and Title IX.\n\nDefendants argue that Mario's claim based on delay in providing him\n\nspecial       education       services     after      Rivera-Lugo's    departure    is\n\ncognizable only under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act\n\n(\"IDEA\"), 20 U.S.C. § 1415, and that the IDEA does not provide for\n\nthe tort-like damages here sought, Nieves-Marquez v. Puerto Rico, 353\n\nF.3d   108,     124    (1st    Cir.    2003);     alternatively,   they   argue    that\n\nplaintiffs were required to resort to administrative remedies before\n\npursuing their IDEA-like claim.                See 20 U.S.C. § 1415(l).\n\n               Neither version of the defendants' theory--preemption or\n\nexhaustion--is a classic sovereign immunity defense.                      Indeed, the\n\n\n                                               -8-\n\fplaintiffs say that on interlocutory appeal, we lack jurisdiction to\n\nentertain these arguments.       But our earlier decision in Nieves-\n\nMarquez holds that, on an interlocutory appeal from the rejection of\n\na   sovereign   immunity   defense,   the   court   may   entertain   certain\n\narguments about the unavailability of monetary damages based on the\n\nIDEA.   353 F.3d at 123-24.\n\n            Nieves-Marquez concluded, partly on technical and partly\n\non policy grounds, that the substantive IDEA issue--whether it\n\npreempted claims under other statutes--was sufficiently intertwined\n\nwith the classic sovereign immunity defense to permit interlocutory\n\nreview.   Still, Nieves-Marquez limited interlocutory review to an\n\nissue of this kind and we do not read it as extending to a defense\n\nsuch as failure to exhaust administrative remedies.          Id. at 124; see\n\nalso Fairley v. Fermaint, 482 F.3d 897, 902-03 (7th Cir. 2007).\n\n            Although the IDEA preemption claim is thus before us, it\n\nlacks merit.    IDEA itself provides that\n\n            [n]othing in this chapter shall be construed\n            to restrict or limit the rights, procedures,\n            and remedies available under the Constitution,\n            the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990,\n            title V of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, or\n            other Federal laws protecting the rights of\n            children with disabilities.\n\n20 U.S.C. § 1415(l).   Thus, on its face IDEA does not preclude claims\n\nagainst the Commonwealth, or the individual defendants, under the\n\nADA, the Rehabilitation Act or (arguably) Title IX as applied to a\n\ndisabled child.\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\f             While we have held that relief under these other statutes\n\nis not available where \"[p]laintiffs' case turns entirely on the\n\nrights created by statute in the IDEA,\" Diaz-Fonseca v. Puerto Rico,\n\n451   F.3d   13,   29    (1st   Cir.   2006),     here   plaintiffs'   claim   is\n\n\"independently available through other sources of law,\" namely, the\n\nretaliation provisions of the three statutes here invoked.4                 These\n\nclaims rest on improper retaliatory intent, are by no means mirrors\n\nof the IDEA, and are not within the rationale of Diaz-Fonseca.\n\n             In the district court, the defendants did make classic\n\nsovereign immunity arguments, specifically, that the Commonwealth\n\n(and officers sued in their official capacities) were protected under\n\nthe Eleventh Amendment.         These arguments turned primarily on the\n\nscope of waiver provisions that appear in two of the relevant\n\nstatutes and, in the case of the ADA, on the extent of Congress'\n\npower to abrogate.       Initially the district court granted defendants'\n\nmotion as to the ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims, but because of\n\nintervening changes in governing authority the district court revised\n\nits position.\n\n             In    the   end,   the    district    court   found   that   classic\n\nsovereign immunity did not apply because of the receipt of federal\n\nfunds under two of the statutes--the Rehabilitation Act and Title IX-\n\n\n      4\n      See 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a) (retaliation claim under the ADA); 29\nU.S.C. § 794a(a)(2); 34 C.F.R. § 104.61 (incorporating Title VI's\nretaliation provision into the Rehabilitation Act); Jackson v.\nBirmingham Bd. of Educ., 544 U.S. 167, 171 (2005) (recognizing a\nretaliation claim under Title IX).\n\n                                        -10-\n\f-and a direct abrogation by the ADA of state sovereign immunity.   The\n\ndefendants have not pursued these arguments in this court; the\n\nconclusions are at least colorable; and we need not pursue further\n\narguments that have not been preserved on appeal.\n\n             Insofar as the appeal presents cognizable legal issues on\n\ninterlocutory appeal, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\nWith regard to issues not appealable under Johnson, the appeal is\n\ndismissed.\n\n             It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\f",

Tirado-Delgado,</i> 990 F.2d 701, 705 (1st Cir.1993), nor to the Secretary of Education because he was sued only in his <span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> official capacity, and qualified immunity does not apply to official capacity claims, usually aimed at injunctive relief based on <i>Ex parte Young,</i> 209 U.S. 123, 159-60, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908). <i>See </i><i>Nereida-Gonzalez,</i> 990 F.2d at 705.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs' brief on appeal says that the only damages claim asserted against Ortega was under section 1983; and the gravamen of this claim after the summary judgment ruling appears to be that Ortega retaliated against plaintiffs in violation of their first amendment rights by denying Mario educational services after his family complained to the police. This would arguably be a legitimate claim under section 1983, if it could be factually supported, <i>Powell v. Alexander,</i> 391 F.3d 1, 16-17 (1st Cir.2004); and such a claim was preserved (although not emphasized) by the complaint.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>In addition to the first amendment claim, the magistrate judge also deemed preserved against Ortega a separate claim based on the same denial of services after Rivera-Lugo's termination. This appears to be based on the theory that the denial of services was \"discriminatory\"  possibly on an equal protection theory. We can find no reference to any such claim in the complaint or in plaintiffs' opposition to summary judgment. We conclude that it was not presented and so think it must be disregarded.</p>\n<p>Turning, then, to the retaliation claim against Ortega, the evidentiary basis for such a claim is invisible to us. Although much time passed after Rivera-Lugo was arrested before Mario got new adequate home services, the defendants' motion for summary judgment pointed to substantial evidence in the record developed in the discovery process indicating that resource problems and bureaucratic tangle were the explanation for the admittedly long delay.</p>\n<p>In opposing summary judgment on the retaliation claim, the plaintiffs baldly asserted that the delay in furnishing services was based on retaliatory animus but without citing <i>any</i> evidence in the record to support such an assertion. And although the magistrate judge discussed the motion for summary judgment on the retaliation claim, her discussion contains no reference to any such evidence. Her decision merely states that the plaintiffs' claim of retaliation raises a disputed issue of material fact.</p>\n<p>Under the case law, an interlocutory appeal is available to review denials of qualified immunity at the summary judgment stage only if based upon an error of law of a kind <i>other</i> than a dispute about the adequacy of evidence. <i>Johnson v. Jones,</i> 515 U.S. 304, 317-18, 115 S.Ct. 2151, 132 L.Ed.2d 238 (1995); <i>Rodríguez-Rodríguez v. Ortiz-Velez,</i> 391 F.3d 36, 40 (1st Cir.2004). The restriction is purely prudential, being designed to avoid the weighing of the evidence at the interlocutory stage.</p>\n<p>Here, defendants do not dispute that under clearly established law, retaliation could give rise to a first amendment claim remediable under section 1983; the only <span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> apparent basis for the denial seems to be the court's <i>perception</i> of a factual dispute, namely, whether there was enough evidence of a retaliatory motive to survive summary judgment. Since the qualified immunity denial does not turn on a legal issue, under <i>Johnson</i> we arguably have no authority to overturn the ruling on interlocutory review.</p>\n<p>Conceivably, <i>Johnson</i>'s limitation could be disregarded on the ground that in denying qualified immunity the magistrate judge made an error of law in disregarding the need for some evidence of <i>retaliatory intent</i> for the first amendment claim. <i>Cf. </i><i>Behrens v. Pelletier,</i> 516 U.S. 299, 313, 116 S.Ct. 834, 133 L.Ed.2d 773 (1996). But it would be a stretch to so construe the magistrate judge's decision. The cleaner course is for her take a fresh look before permitting a seemingly hopeless retaliation claim to proceed to trial</p>\n<p>We turn now to the defendants' claim that, in addition, sovereign immunity defeats retaliation claims against the Commonwealth and the official capacity defendants based on three other statutes: the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act and Title IX. Defendants argue that Mario's claim based on delay in providing him special education services after Rivera-Lugo's departure is cognizable only under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\"IDEA\"), 20 U.S.C. § 1415, and that the IDEA does not provide for the tort-like damages here sought, <i>Nieves-Marquez v. Puerto Rico,</i> 353 F.3d 108, 124 (1st Cir.2003); alternatively, they argue that plaintiffs were required to resort to administrative remedies before pursuing their IDEA-like claim. <i>See</i> 20 U.S.C. § 1415(<i>l</i>).</p>\n<p>Neither version of the defendants' theory-preemption or exhaustion-is a classic sovereign immunity defense. Indeed, the plaintiffs say that on interlocutory appeal, we lack jurisdiction to entertain these arguments. But our earlier decision in <i>Nieves-Marquez</i> holds that, on an interlocutory appeal from the rejection of a sovereign immunity defense, the court may entertain certain arguments about the unavailability of monetary damages based on the IDEA. 353 F.3d at 123-24.</p>\n<p><i>Nieves-Marquez</i> concluded, partly on technical and partly on policy grounds, that the substantive IDEA issue  whether it preempted claims under other statutes  was sufficiently intertwined with the classic sovereign immunity defense to permit interlocutory review. Still, <i>Nieves-Marquez</i> limited interlocutory review to an issue of this kind and we do not read it as extending to a defense such as failure to exhaust administrative remedies. <i>Id.</i> at 124; <i>see also </i><i>Fairley v. Fermaint,</i> 482 F.3d 897, 902-03 (7th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>Although the IDEA preemption claim is thus before us, it lacks merit. IDEA itself provides that</p>\n<blockquote>[n]othing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict or limit the rights, procedures, and remedies available under the Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, title V of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, or other Federal laws protecting the rights of children with disabilities.</blockquote>\n<p>20 U.S.C. § 1415(<i>l</i>). Thus, on its face IDEA does not preclude claims against the Commonwealth, or the individual defendants, under the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act or (arguably) Title IX as applied to a disabled child.</p>\n<p>While we have held that relief under these other statutes is not available where \"[p]laintiffs' case turns entirely on the rights created by statute in the IDEA,\" <i>Diaz-Fonseca v. Puerto Rico,</i> 451 F.3d 13, 29 (1st Cir.2006), here plaintiffs' claim is \"independently available through other sources of law,\" namely, the retaliation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> provisions of the three statutes here invoked.<sup>[4]</sup> These claims rest on improper retaliatory intent, are by no means mirrors of the IDEA, and are not within the rationale of <i>Diaz-Fonseca.</i></p>\n<p>In the district court, the defendants did make classic sovereign immunity arguments, specifically, that the Commonwealth (and officers sued in their official capacities) were protected under the Eleventh Amendment. These arguments turned primarily on the scope of waiver provisions that appear in two of the relevant statutes and, in the case of the ADA, on the extent of Congress' power to abrogate. Initially the district court granted defendants' motion as to the ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims, but because of intervening changes in governing authority the district court revised its position.</p>\n<p>In the end, the district court found that classic sovereign immunity did not apply because of the receipt of federal funds under two of the statutes  the Rehabilitation Act and Title IX  and a direct abrogation by the ADA of state sovereign immunity. The defendants have not pursued these arguments in this court; the conclusions are at least colorable; and we need not pursue further arguments that have not been preserved on appeal.</p>\n<p>Insofar as the appeal presents cognizable legal issues on interlocutory appeal, the judgment of the district court is <i>affirmed.</i> With regard to issues not appealable under <i>Johnson,</i> the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The child, age eight at the time of the incidents, is referred to in the briefs by his initials; we use one of his given names in this decision.</p>\n<p>[2]  The Commonwealth initially sought dismissal on sovereign immunity grounds and ultimately obtained dismissal only of section 1983 claims on this ground. Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment against Rivera-Lugo, arguing that his criminal conviction established his civil liability; the district court granted the motion as to plaintiffs' physical abuse claims, but denied it as to the sexual abuse claims.</p>\n<p>[3]  Section 1983 cannot be used as a vehicle for ADA or other statutory claims that provide their own frameworks for damages. <i>See </i><i>Fitzgerald v.

In September 2001, Mario's grandmother began to suspect that he was being physically and sexually abused by his teacher, Edgar Rivera-Lugo. After <span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> further investigation, Mario's family filed a complaint with the police. Rivera-Lugo was arrested and, following a bench trial, was found guilty of misdemeanor aggravated assault and institutional abuse.</p>\n<p>Mario, together with his parents and grandmother, then filed suit in federal district court based on the abuse he suffered and the alleged deprivation of educational services in the year-long period following Rivera-Lugo's termination. The defendants named were Rivera-Lugo in his official and individual capacities; Elizabeth Ortega, regional supervisor of special education, in her official and individual capacities; the Commonwealth Secretary of Education in his official capacity; and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</p>\n<p>Although the complaint is not crystal clear as to which claims were asserted against which defendants, it did identify as bases for relief Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 12132 (2000); section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (2000); Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C §§ 1681-88 (2000); section 1983, 42 U.S.C. § 1983; and various provisions of Puerto Rico law. The complaint sought compensatory damages of $5 million, punitive damages against each defendant and injunctive relief.</p>\n<p>Following various motions and orders,<sup>[2]</sup> defendants Ortega, the Secretary of Education, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico sought summary judgment on the federal claims. They argued that they were unaware of Rivera-Lugo's abusive behavior and that when they learned of it they took immediate action to remove him. Alternatively, they argued that they are shielded by qualified immunity (as to Ortega in her individual capacity) or sovereign immunity (for the Commonwealth and the defendants sued in their official capacities).</p>\n<p>The magistrate judge, presiding with the consent of the parties, granted summary judgment in part, finding that Rivera-Lugo's supervisors did not participate in or act recklessly with regard to Rivera-Lugo's misconduct. However, the magistrate judge found that material disputes of fact remained regarding defendants' actions following Rivera-Lugo's termination, primarily claims that the defendants had retaliated against Mario for complaining to the police; and the court denied defendants' immunity defenses as to such claims. The abuse claims therefore remain pending only against Rivera-Lugo.</p>\n<p>Defendants other than Rivera-Lugo now appeal, invoking our jurisdiction to review on an interlocutory basis a district court's denial of qualified and sovereign immunity defenses. <i>Torres v.
