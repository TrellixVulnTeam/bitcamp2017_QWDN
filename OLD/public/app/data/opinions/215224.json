In this copyright case, plaintiff\n\nLatin American Music Company (\"LAMCO\") appeals from orders awarding\n\nattorneys' fees incurred below in favor of prevailing defendant\n\nAmerican Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (\"ASCAP\").\n\nWe readily affirm.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND1\n\n           We   begin   by     briefly    setting   the    stage.    After\n\nsuccessfully defending on appeal a jury verdict finding that it had\n\nnot infringed, ASCAP moved for attorneys' fees and costs in the\n\ndistrict court.    It requested slightly more than $82,000, incurred\n\nin pretrial and trial proceedings between 2005 and 2008.             LAMCO\n\nopposed the motion.          The district court carefully considered\n\nASCAP's request and agreed with the bulk of it.           The court awarded\n\nASCAP approximately $55,000 in attorneys' fees and taxed $2,000 in\n\ncosts.\n\n           LAMCO moved for reconsideration under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n59(e).    The court denied LAMCO's motion, but took the opportunity\n\nto modify the fee award.      The court explained that, in its initial\n\norder, it had reduced the fees sought for one attorney by ten\n\npercent based on \"the high percentage of tasks performed by this\n\n\n\n      1\n      We assume familiarity with the history of this case, and\ndirect the interested reader to Latin Am. Music Co. v. Am. Soc'y of\nComposers, Authors and Publishers, 629 F.3d 262 (1st Cir. 2010)\n(per curiam), Latin Am. Music Co. v. Am. Soc'y of Composers,\nAuthors and Publishers, 593 F.3d 95 (1st Cir. 2010), and Latin Am.\nMusic Co. v. Archdiocese, 499 F.3d 32 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n                                    -2-\n\fpartner       as    compared        with   those     performed       by      lower-priced\n\nassociates.\"         On further reflection, however, the court decided\n\nagainst \"second-guessing a firm's allocation of tasks where the\n\nprevailing         party    was     satisfied      with    counsel's      performance.\"\n\nAccordingly,        the     court     struck    that      particular      reduction    and\n\nincreased the total award, including costs, to just under $62,000.\n\n               LAMCO       appealed    the     fee     award   and     the    denial    of\n\nreconsideration.\n\nII.    DISCUSSION\n\n       A.      Timely Registration and Attorneys' Fees\n\n               LAMCO's lead argument on appeal is that attorneys' fees\n\nare barred because the copyright claim to the disputed song,\n\n\"Caballo Viejo,\" was not timely registered.2                    See 17 U.S.C. § 412\n\n(2006).       We disagree for two reasons:             one of fact and the other of\n\nlaw.       As a matter of fact, the copyright was timely registered.                   As\n\na matter of law, the statute does not apply to a defendant who is\n\nsuccessful in defending claims that it infringed.\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      This argument was not sufficiently articulated in the\ndistrict court. As presented there, the argument consisted of only\ntwo sentences, no case citations, and precious little analysis.\nArguments of this stock normally are considered waived on appeal.\nIn re Olympic Mills Corp., 477 F.3d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 2007); McCoy v.\nMass. Institute of Tech., 950 F.2d 13, 21-22 (1st Cir. 1991).\nHere, however, the district court did LAMCO's homework,\nthoughtfully considered the question, and ultimately disagreed.\nGiven these circumstances, and because the question is not a close\none, we proceed to address the merits.\n\n                                             -3-\n\f           Section 412 bars recovery of statutory damages under\n\nsection 504 and attorneys' fees under section 505 by copyright\n\nowners   who   failed   to   register    the   work   before   the   alleged\n\ninfringement began. Id. § 412(2) (prohibiting certain remedies for\n\n\"any infringement of copyright commenced after first publication of\n\nthe work and before the effective date of its registration, unless\n\nsuch registration is made within three months after the first\n\npublication of the work\"); see also Johnson v. Gordon, 409 F.3d 12,\n\n20 (1st Cir. 2005) (recognizing that registration is \"a condition\n\nprecedent for obtaining certain remedies, such as statutory damages\n\nand attorneys' fees\").\n\n           By its plain language, section 412 does not apply in this\n\ncase.    According to LAMCO's complaint, the alleged infringement\n\nbegan in 1994.    \"Caballo Viejo,\" however, was registered with the\n\nCopyright Office in 1983, more than a decade earlier.\n\n           Besides, there is nothing in the statute that prohibits\n\nfee awards in cases, like this one, of noninfringement. The reason\n\nis obvious:    only copyright owners may register their copyright\n\nclaims, the conduct incentivized by section 412.               A defendant\n\naccused of infringing someone else's copyright could not possibly\n\ncomply with the statute's registration criterion. Section 412 thus\n\ndoes not, logically, apply to alleged infringers.               See O'Well\n\nNovelty Co. v. Offenbacher, Inc., 225 F.3d 655, 2000 WL 1055108, at\n\n*7 (4th Cir. Aug. 1, 2000) (unpublished table decision) (holding\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fthat section 412 \"only applies to plaintiffs who assert copyright\n\ninfringement claims and not to defendants who successfully defend\n\nagainst such claims\"); Domingo Cambeiro Prof'l Corp. v. Advent, 211\n\nF.3d        1273,   2000   WL   262597,   at    *4   (9th   Cir.    Mar.     7,   2000)\n\n(unpublished table decision) (affirming fee award to prevailing\n\ndefendant; explaining that section 412 \"does not apply to this case\n\nbecause there has been no finding of infringement\"). See generally\n\n4 Melville B. Nimmer and David Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright §\n\n14.10[B][2] (rev. ed. 2010) (\"[Section 412] does not speak to a\n\nfinding        of   noninfringement.           Accordingly,    if     [the    alleged\n\ninfringer] prevails, nothing on the face of the statute bars\n\nawarding fees to it.            In this way, the registration requirement is\n\nnonsymmetrical.\"); 6 William F. Patry, Patry on Copyright § 22:204\n\n(2010) (similar).3\n\n       B.       Prevailing Party Status and Reasonableness\n\n                LAMCO also challenges ASCAP's status as a prevailing\n\nparty and the reasonableness of the fee award.                      Both challenges\n\nfail.\n\n                Section 505 permits courts, in their discretion, to award\n\nreasonable attorneys' fees to the prevailing party.                    17 U.S.C. §\n\n505 (2006); Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc., 510 U.S. 517, 535 (1994).                      A\n\n\n        3\n      LAMCO's reliance on M & D Int'l Corp. v. Chan, 901 F. Supp.\n1502 (D. Haw. 1995), is misplaced.     In Chan, the parties each\nclaimed copyrights in the disputed works, id. at 1504, not\nperformance licenses from third-party copyright owners, as in this\ncase.\n\n                                          -5-\n\f\"prevailing party\" is \"one who has 'prevailed on the merits of at\n\nleast some claims,'\" Torres-Negrón v. J & N Records, LLC, 504 F.3d\n\n151, 164 (1st Cir. 2007) (quoting Buckhannon Bd. & Care Home, Inc.\n\nv. W. Va. Dep't of Health & Human Res., 532 U.S. 598, 603 (2001)),\n\nno matter whether the plaintiff or the defendant prevailed.             See\n\nFogerty, 510 U.S. at 535.     \"A showing of frivolity or bad faith is\n\nnot required; rather, the prevailing party need only show that its\n\nopponent's copyright claims or defenses were 'objectively weak.'\"\n\nLatin Am. Music Co., 629 F.3d at 263 (quoting García-Goyco v. Law\n\nEnvtl. Consultants, Inc., 428 F.3d 14, 20 (1st Cir. 2005)).\n\n            Our review of a fee award to a prevailing party is\n\n\"extremely deferential.\"     García-Goyco, 428 F.3d at 22.         \"We will\n\ndisturb a ruling under section 505 only if the record persuades us\n\nthat the trial court indulged in a serious lapse in judgment.\"          Id.\n\n(quoting Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Borland Int'l, Inc., 140 F.3d 70, 72\n\n(1st Cir. 1998)).\n\n            There is no question that ASCAP is a prevailing party.\n\nIt initially obtained summary judgment on LAMCO's infringement\n\nclaims.    We affirmed that ruling in significant part, but remanded\n\nbecause of disputed facts concerning one song.             On remand ASCAP\n\nobtained   a   favorable   jury   verdict   at   trial    and   successfully\n\ndefended that verdict in a later appeal.                 ASCAP then sought\n\nattorneys' fees in the district court and submitted detailed\n\nbilling records establishing the reasonableness of its request.\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fBased on its discretion and the weakness of LAMCO's claims, the\n\ncourt awarded ASCAP a majority of those fees.               We have carefully\n\nreviewed ASCAP's documentation and the court's rescript, and are\n\nsatisfied that all aspects of the fee award fall comfortably within\n\nthe court's discretion.\n\n     C.    Motion for Reconsideration\n\n           As its final lament, LAMCO argues that its motion for\n\nreconsideration should have been granted.             The hurdle is a high\n\none, see Palmer v. Champion Mortg., 465 F.3d 24, 29 (1st Cir. 2006)\n\n(\"[T]he   movant    must    demonstrate    either   that    newly   discovered\n\nevidence (not previously available) has come to light or that the\n\nrending   court    committed   a   manifest   error    of   law.\"),   and   our\n\nstandard of review is correspondingly deferential, see id. (\"[W]e\n\nwill not overturn the district court's denial of a motion for\n\nreconsideration absent an abuse of discretion.\").                   Here, the\n\ndistrict court was correct that LAMCO's motion, which advanced\n\nnothing new or convincing, fell far short.            There was no abuse of\n\ndiscretion.4\n\n           Affirmed.       Costs to appellee.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      LAMCO claims in passing that the district court's decision\nsua sponte to increase the fee award was error. The argument is\nwaived. United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990)\n(\"[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by\nsome effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\").\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f",

Young, and Holland &amp; Knight LLP, on brief for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, Chief Judge, LIPEZ and HOWARD, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>HOWARD, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>In this copyright case, plaintiff Latin American Music Company (\"LAMCO\") appeals from orders awarding attorneys' fees incurred below in favor of prevailing defendant American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (\"ASCAP\"). We readily affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND<sup>[1]</sup></h2>\n<p>We begin by briefly setting the stage. After successfully defending on appeal a jury verdict finding that it had not infringed, ASCAP moved for attorneys' fees and costs in the district court. It requested slightly more than $82,000, incurred in pretrial and trial proceedings between 2005 and 2008. LAMCO opposed the motion. The district court carefully considered ASCAP's request and agreed with the bulk of it. The court awarded ASCAP approximately $55,000 in attorneys' fees and taxed $2,000 in costs.</p>\n<p>LAMCO moved for reconsideration under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e). The court denied LAMCO's motion, but took the opportunity to modify the fee award. The court explained that, in its initial order, it had reduced the fees sought for one attorney by ten percent based on \"the high percentage of tasks performed by this partner as compared with those performed by lower-priced associates.\" On further reflection, however, the court decided against \"second-guessing a firm's allocation of tasks where the prevailing party was satisfied with counsel's performance.\" Accordingly, the court struck that particular reduction and increased the total award, including costs, to just under $62,000.</p>\n<p>LAMCO appealed the fee award and the denial of reconsideration.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Timely Registration and Attorneys' Fees</i>\n</h2>\n<p>LAMCO's lead argument on appeal is that attorneys' fees are barred because <span class=\"star-pagination\">*90</span> the copyright claim to the disputed song, \"Caballo Viejo,\" was not timely registered.<sup>[2]</sup><i>See</i> 17 U.S.C. § 412 (2006). We disagree for two reasons: one of fact and the other of law. As a matter of fact, the copyright was timely registered. As a matter of law, the statute does not apply to a defendant who is successful in defending claims that it infringed.</p>\n<p>Section 412 bars recovery of statutory damages under section 504 and attorneys' fees under section 505 by copyright owners who failed to register the work before the alleged infringement began. <i>Id.</i> § 412(2) (prohibiting certain remedies for \"any infringement of copyright commenced after first publication of the work and before the effective date of its registration, unless such registration is made within three months after the first publication of the work\"); <i>see also </i><i>Johnson v. Gordon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201613\"><a href=\"/opinion/201613/johnson-v-gordon/\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 20 (1st Cir.2005) (recognizing that registration is \"a condition precedent for obtaining certain remedies, such as statutory damages and attorneys' fees\").</p>\n<p>By its plain language, section 412 does not apply in this case. According to LAMCO's complaint, the alleged infringement began in 1994. \"Caballo Viejo,\" however, <i>was</i> registered with the Copyright Office in 1983, more than a decade earlier.</p>\n<p>Besides, there is nothing in the statute that prohibits fee awards in cases, like this one, of <i>non</i> infringement. The reason is obvious: only copyright owners may register their copyright claims, the conduct incentivized by section 412. A defendant accused of infringing someone else's copyright could not possibly comply with the statute's registration criterion. Section 412 thus does not, logically, apply to alleged infringers. <i>See </i><i>O'Well Novelty Co. v. Offenbacher, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">655</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1055108</span></span>, at *7 (4th Cir.

Nimmer and David Nimmer, <i>Nimmer on Copyright</i> § 14.10[B][2] (rev. ed.2010) (\"[Section 412] does not speak to a finding of <i>noninfringement.</i> Accordingly, if [the alleged infringer] prevails, nothing on the face of the statute bars awarding fees to it. In this way, the registration requirement is nonsymmetrical.\"); 6 William F. Patry, <i>Patry on Copyright</i> § 22:204 (2010) (similar).<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Prevailing Party Status and Reasonableness</i>\n</h2>\n<p>LAMCO also challenges ASCAP's status as a prevailing party and the reasonableness of the fee award. Both challenges fail.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*91</span> Section 505 permits courts, in their discretion, to award reasonable attorneys' fees to the prevailing party. 17 U.S.C. § 505 (2006); <i>Fogerty v.

Music Co.,</i> 629 F.3d at 263 (quoting <i>García-Goyco v. Law Envtl. Consultants, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201895\"><a href=\"/opinion/201895/garcia-goyco-v-law-environmental/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 20 (1st Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p>Our review of a fee award to a prevailing party is \"extremely deferential.\" <i>García-Goyco,</i> 428 F.3d at 22. \"We will disturb a ruling under section 505 only if the record persuades us that the trial court indulged in a serious lapse in judgment.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Borland Int'l, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197950\"><a href=\"/opinion/197950/lotus-v-borland/\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span>, 72 (1st Cir.1998)).</p>\n<p>There is no question that ASCAP is a prevailing party. It initially obtained summary judgment on LAMCO's infringement claims. We affirmed that ruling in significant part, but remanded because of disputed facts concerning one song. On remand ASCAP obtained a favorable jury verdict at trial and successfully defended that verdict in a later appeal. ASCAP then sought attorneys' fees in the district court and submitted detailed billing records establishing the reasonableness of its request. Based on its discretion and the weakness of LAMCO's claims, the court awarded ASCAP a majority of those fees. We have carefully reviewed ASCAP's documentation and the court's rescript, and are satisfied that all aspects of the fee award fall comfortably within the court's discretion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Motion for Reconsideration</i>\n</h2>\n<p>As its final lament, LAMCO argues that its motion for reconsideration should have been granted. The hurdle is a high one, <i>see </i><i>Palmer v. Champion Mortg.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202442\"><a href=\"/opinion/202442/palmer-v-champion-mortgage/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 29 (1st Cir.2006) (\"[T]he movant must demonstrate either that newly discovered evidence (not previously available) has come to light or that the rending court committed a manifest error of law.\"), and our standard of review is correspondingly deferential, <i>see id.</i> (\"[W]e will not overturn the district court's denial of a motion for reconsideration absent an abuse of discretion.\"). Here, the district court was correct that LAMCO's motion, which advanced nothing new or convincing, fell far short. There was no abuse of discretion.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i> Costs to appellee.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  We assume familiarity with the history of this case, and direct the interested reader to <i>Latin Am. Music Co. v. Am. Soc'y of Composers, Authors and Publishers,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">629</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">262</span></span> (1st Cir.2010) (per curiam), <i>Latin Am.

As presented there, the argument consisted of only two sentences, no case citations, and precious little analysis. Arguments of this stock normally are considered waived on appeal. <i>In re Olympic Mills Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202596\"><a href=\"/opinion/202596/siaca-v-dcc-operating-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.2007); <i>McCoy v.

Here, however, the district court did LAMCO's homework, thoughtfully considered the question, and ultimately disagreed. Given these circumstances, and because the question is not a close one, we proceed to address the merits.</p>\n<p>[3]  LAMCO's reliance on <i>M &amp; D Int'l Corp. v.
