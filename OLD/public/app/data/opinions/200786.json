R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                        For the First Circuit\n\nNo. 02-2591\n\n                      UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\n\n                                 Appellee,\n\n                                      v.\n\n                       DELCIO ANTONIO PAULINO,\n\n                         Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n\n\n   APPEAL FROM A JUDGMENT OF THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n        [Hon. Juan M. Pérez-Giménez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n               Torruella and Lipez, Circuit Judges,\n              and Schwarzer,* Senior District Judge.\n\n\n\n     Maria Soledad Ramirez Becerra for appellant.\n     H.S. Garcia, United States Attorney, Nelson Pérez-Sosa and\nSonia I. Torres-Pabón, Assistant United States Attorneys, for\nAppellee.\n\n\n                           December 24, 2003\n\n\n\n\n*Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation.\n\f               PER CURIAM.         Paulino argues that the district court's\n\nimposition of a condition of supervised release requiring him to\n\n\"submit    to    one       drug    test   within    15     days   of    release    from\n\nimprisonment         and   thereafter     as     required   by    the   US    Probation\n\nOfficer\" constitutes an impermissible delegation of sentencing\n\nauthority.       Paulino is correct.             In United States v. Meléndez-\n\nSantana, No. 01-2386 & No. 01-2397, we recently vacated a nearly\n\nidentical condition on delegation grounds, while noting that it\n\nwould be permissible for the court to establish the range of drug\n\ntests     to    be    performed,        with   probation     officers        exercising\n\ndiscretion on the exact number of drug tests to be performed within\n\nthat range.          We must VACATE the drug testing condition in the\n\nwritten sentencing order and REMAND to the district court for\n\nreconsideration            of     the   drug     testing    requirement.           That\n\nreconsideration must be done in a manner consistent with the\n\nDefendant's right to be present at sentencing.\n\n               SO ORDERED.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\f",
