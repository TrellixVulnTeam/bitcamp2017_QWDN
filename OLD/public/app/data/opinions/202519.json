Goddu, Federal Defender Office, District of\nMassachusetts, with whom Kevin Fitzgerald, Federal Defender Office,\nDistrict of Rhode Island, was on brief, for appellant.\n     Donald C. Lockhart, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Robert Clark Corrente, United States Attorney, and Zechariah\nChafee, Assistant United States Attorney, was on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                        November 21, 2006\n\f            TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge. Defendant-appellant William J.\n\nBennett (\"Bennett\") pled guilty to possession of a firearm in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1).           He now appeals the sentencing\n\nenhancements applied pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act\n\n(\"ACCA\"), 18 U.S.C. § 924(e), on the basis that (1) the predicate\n\nconviction for breaking and entering a steel storage shed does not\n\nconstitute a violent felony, (2) his Sixth Amendment rights were\n\nviolated when the judge, rather than a jury, determined that the\n\nconviction constituted a violent felony, and (3) his Fifth and\n\nSixth Amendment rights were violated when the Government failed to\n\nproperly plead and prove the ACCA enhancements.              We find no merit\n\nto these arguments and therefore affirm the district court's\n\ndecision.\n\n                              I.    Background\n\n            On March 15, 2005, the Westerly, Rhode Island police\n\nretrieved a stolen 9 mm handgun, which they were told had been\n\npurchased from Bennett. Bennett later admitted to selling the gun.\n\nOn June 15, 2005, a federal grand jury returned a one-count\n\nindictment charging Bennett with being a felon in possession of a\n\nfirearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1).                 Bennett entered\n\ninto a plea agreement with prosecutors on August 22, 2005 and pled\n\nguilty to the charge on September 15, 2005.\n\n            Based   on   three     prior    Rhode   Island   convictions    for\n\nbreaking    and   entering   and    related    crimes,   the    United   States\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fProbation Office (\"USPO\") concluded that Bennett was subject to a\n\nmandatory minimum sentence of 180 months under the ACCA.1            Bennett\n\nobjected to the USPO's determination, arguing that his 1994 Rhode\n\nIsland conviction for breaking and entering a steel storage shed\n\ndid not constitute a crime of violence and therefore did not\n\nqualify as a predicate for the ACCA sentencing enhancement.\n\n            At the plea colloquy, the state prosecutor stated that\n\nthe government would be prepared to prove at trial that the\n\ndefendant   \"entered   a   steel   storage   shed   .   .   .   belonging   to\n\n[another] with intent to commit larceny in the nighttime.\" Bennett\n\nagreed with this statement.        Based on a reading of the statute\n\nunder which Bennett was convicted and the record before the court,\n\nthe district court found that Bennett was properly classified as an\n\narmed career criminal and sentenced him to 180 months imprisonment.\n\n                            II.    Discussion\n\nA.   The Taylor Definition of \"Burglary\"\n\n            Under the ACCA, a defendant who violates § 922(g)(1) and\n\nhas three previous convictions for violent felonies or serious drug\n\noffenses is subject to a minimum sentence of 180 months.           18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 924(e)(1).    The definition of \"violent felony\" includes, inter\n\nalia, the crime of burglary, but the term \"burglary\" itself is not\n\ndefined in the statute.     Id. § 922(e)(2).\n\n\n1\n  Absent the USPO's determination that Bennett was an armed career\ncriminal, Bennett would have been subject to an advisory guideline\nrange of 24-30 months.\n\n                                    -3-\n\f           The Supreme Court, however, addressed the meaning of\n\nburglary as used in the ACCA in United States v. Taylor, 495 U.S.\n\n575 (1990).    The Court first rejected both the view that the\n\ndefinition depends on the label adopted by the state of conviction\n\nand the idea that Congress meant to include only the common-law\n\ndefinition of burglary as \"breaking and entering of a dwelling at\n\nnight, with intent to commit a felony.\"   Id. at 592.   Rather, the\n\nCourt concluded that\n\n           Congress meant by 'burglary' the generic sense\n           in which the term is now used in the criminal\n           codes of most states.     Although the exact\n           formulations vary, the generic, contemporary\n           meaning of burglary contains at least the\n           following    elements:    an    unlawful    or\n           unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a\n           building or other structure, with intent to\n           commit a crime.\n\n\nId. at 598.   Thus, an offense qualifies as \"burglary\" for purposes\n\nof an ACCA sentencing enhancement if it \"substantially corresponds\n\nto 'generic' burglary, or the charging paper and jury instructions\n\nactually required the jury to find all the elements of generic\n\nburglary in order to convict the defendant.\"   Id. at 602.\n\n           In assessing whether a state conviction qualifies as\n\ngeneric burglary, a court should take a categorical approach,\n\n\"looking only to the statutory definitions of the prior offenses,\n\nand not to the particular facts underlying those convictions.\" Id.\n\nat 600.   When the state statute defines burglary more broadly than\n\nthe generic definition, however, the court may then look to whether\n\n                                -4-\n\fthe jury was required to find all the elements of generic burglary.\n\nId. at 602.\n\n            Defendant contends that his conviction for breaking and\n\nentering a steel storage shed does not meet the definition of\n\ngeneric burglary under Taylor, and therefore does not constitute a\n\nviolent    felony   as   determined   by    the   district   court,   for   two\n\nreasons: First, he argues that to qualify as a \"building or other\n\nstructure\" under the Taylor definition, the building or structure\n\nmust be \"occupiable.\"2        Second, he argues for the first time on\n\nappeal that the statute under which he was convicted for the\n\npredicate offense did not include an \"unlawful or unprivileged\n\nentry\" element as required by Taylor.\n\n                     1. \"Building or other structure\"\n\n            We review the determination that a defendant is subject\n\nto   an   ACCA   sentencing   enhancement    de   novo,   United   States   v.\n\nMastera, 435 F.3d 56, 59 (1st Cir. 2006), but we review the\n\ndistrict court's factual findings underlying the determination for\n\nclear error, United States v. Delgado, 288 F.3d 49, 52 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).     We begin our review with the Rhode Island statute under\n\nwhich Bennett was convicted for the predicate crime at issue,\n\n\n\n2\n   There is some question as to whether Bennett preserved this\nargument for appeal. He certainly did not develop the argument\nvery well, focusing instead on whether his conviction satisfied the\n\"otherwise\" clause of 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), but we will\nassume for purposes of this decision that he did preserve the\nargument below.\n\n                                      -5-\n\fentitled \"Breaking and entering other buildings with criminal\n\nintent - Railroad cars - Tractor trailers.\"           R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-8-\n\n5.   The first clause of the statute makes it unlawful to \"break and\n\nenter or enter in the nighttime, with intent to commit [a crime] in\n\nit, any barn, stable, carriage house, or other building.\"                Id.   The\n\nsecond clause addresses the similar breaking and entering of\n\nrailroad cars and tractor trailers.          Id.\n\n            Because the statute defines burglary more broadly than\n\nTaylor did, including the breaking and entering of more than just\n\nbuildings and structures, we look to the record before the court to\n\ndetermine    under    which   clause    Bennett     was   convicted.3          The\n\ntranscript of the plea colloquy clearly shows that Bennett was\n\nconvicted under the first clause of the statute, involving the\n\nburglary    of   \"other   buildings,\"       and    therefore   we    base      our\n\ndetermination    of   whether   the    conviction    qualifies      as   generic\n\nburglary on the elements required for conviction under the \"other\n\nbuildings\" clause.\n\n            Bennett contends that to meet the Taylor definition of\n\ngeneric burglary, the structure involved in a predicate crime must\n\nbe \"occupiable,\" in the sense that it must be large enough to\n\n\n\n3\n  In examining the record, a court is \"limited to the terms of the\ncharging document, the terms of a plea agreement or transcript of\ncolloquy between judge and defendant in which the factual basis for\nthe plea was confirmed by the defendant, or to some comparable\njudicial record of this information.\" Shepard v. United States,\n544 U.S. 13, 26 (2005).\n\n                                      -6-\n\faccommodate a person.    He points to a Ninth Circuit case, United\n\nStates v. Sparks, 265 F.3d 825, 835 (9th Cir. 2001), which found\n\nthat the burglary of a storage locker that would not accommodate a\n\nperson does not fall within the definition of generic burglary.\n\nBennett also asserts that Rhode Island law suggests a requirement\n\nof habitability or occupiable space.\n\n          The types of buildings to which the Rhode Island statute\n\nrefers, such as barns, stables, and presumably, steel storage\n\nsheds, clearly fit within Taylor's definition of generic burglary;\n\nthey are, by the plain language of the statute, \"buildings or other\n\nstructures.\"    They    clearly   do    not   comprise   such   items   as\n\nautomobiles, boats, railroad cars, tents, or vending machines,\n\nwhich Taylor rejected as \"structures\" for purposes of generic\n\nburglary. Taylor also rejected the idea that state law defines the\n\ncontours of burglary under the ACCA, and therefore we decline to\n\nlook to Rhode Island law to resolve this question.          Furthermore,\n\nSparks is inapposite, because the statute at issue plainly concerns\n\nthe burglary of \"buildings\" as opposed to smaller enclosed spaces\n\nsuch as storage lockers.   Bennett was convicted of \"entering\" into\n\na steel storage shed, and therefore we know that the structure was\n\nlarge enough to be entered by a person.        Thus this case does not\n\nraise any issue about structures not large enough to permit human\n\nentry.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f                 2.   \"Unlawful or unprivileged entry\"\n\n          Bennett next contends that his conviction for breaking\n\nand entering a steel storage shed does not meet Taylor's definition\n\nbecause the statute under which he was convicted did not require an\n\n\"unlawful or unprivileged\" entry, and the record before the court\n\ndid not indicate that his entry was \"unlawful or unprivileged.\"\n\nBennett did not raise this issue below and therefore we review for\n\nplain error.   United States v. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).   We have not addressed the contours of the \"unlawful or\n\nunprivileged\" element of generic burglary under Taylor, and there\n\nexists a circuit split on the issue.     Compare United States v.\n\nBowden, 975 F.2d 1080, 1084-85 (4th Cir. 1992) (finding that \"the\n\nentry of a man who enters without breaking with intent to commit a\n\nfelony or larceny is neither lawful nor privileged, so it must be\n\nwithin Taylor\"), with United States v. Maness, 23 F.3d 1006, 1008-\n\n09 (6th Cir. 1994) (finding that the same statute at issue in\n\nBowden \"does not satisfy Taylor's definition of generic burglary\"\n\nbecause intent to commit a crime is a \"separate and distinct\n\nelement[]\" from unlawful or unprivileged entry).         In light of\n\nconflicting case law, any error that might have been committed by\n\nthe district court was not \"obvious,\" and therefore not plain\n\nerror.   United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 734 (1993) (\"At a\n\nminimum, court of appeals cannot correct an error pursuant to Rule\n\n52(b) unless the error is clear under current law.\").\n\n\n                                -8-\n\fB.    Constitutional and statutory claims\n\n              Bennett's remaining two claims merit little discussion.\n\nFirst, he claims that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated\n\nbecause    the      judge,   rather    than   a    jury,    determined      that   his\n\npredicate      conviction     constituted      a   violent       felony.       Bennett\n\nsuggests      that   United   States    v.    Booker,      543   U.S.    220   (2005),\n\nrequires that the nature of his conviction be determined beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt by a jury. We very recently rejected the position\n\nthat a jury must determine whether a prior conviction is a violent\n\nfelony for purposes of a sentencing enhancement; the determination\n\nis a question of law and therefore for the court, not the jury.\n\nUnited States v. Bishop, 453 F.3d 30, 32 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n              Second, Bennet claims that his Fifth and Sixth Amendment\n\nrights were violated because the Government failed to properly\n\nplead and prove the ACCA enhancements.              He asks us to find that as\n\na    matter    of    statutory   construction,        the    ACCA       requires   the\n\nGovernment to charge his prior convictions in an indictment and\n\nprove them beyond a reasonable doubt. Bennett concedes that he did\n\nnot raise this issue below.           We thus review for plain error, which\n\nrequires that the defendant show \"(1) that an error occurred (2)\n\nwhich was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the\n\ndefendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the\n\nfairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"\n\nDuarte, 246 F.3d at 60.          The district court committed no obvious\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\ferror, since the text of the ACCA says nothing about pleading and\n\nproof of predicate convictions.   Furthermore, we recently rejected\n\nin United States v. McKenney the constitutional argument that the\n\nGovernment must charge predicate convictions under the ACCA in an\n\nindictment, reiterating that \"[t]he Supreme Court has rejected the\n\nargument that under the Constitution, recidivism must be treated as\n\nan element of the offense, included in the indictment, and proved\n\nto a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\"   450 F.3d 39, 45-46 (1st Cir.\n\n2006) (citing Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224, 239\n\n(1998)).   As a result, the district court did not commit plain\n\nerror in failing to apply the doctrine of constitutional avoidance\n\nby reading into the ACCA Bennett's proposed requirement.   There is\n\nno constitutional issue and therefore nothing to avoid.\n\n                         III.    Conclusion\n\n           For the reasons stated above, we affirm the sentence\n\nimposed by the district court.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\f",

Duarte,</i> 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.2001). We have not addressed the contours of the \"unlawful or unprivileged\" element of generic burglary under <i>Taylor,</i> and there exists a circuit split on the issue. <i>Compare United States v.

In light of conflicting case law, any error that might have been committed by the district court was not \"obvious,\" and therefore not plain error. <i>United States v.

Constitutional and statutory claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bennett's remaining two claims merit little discussion. First, he claims that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated because the judge, rather than a jury, determined that his predicate conviction constituted a violent felony. Bennett suggests that <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), requires that the nature of his conviction be determined beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury. We very recently rejected the position that a jury must determine whether a prior conviction is a violent felony for purposes of a sentencing enhancement; the determination is a question of law and therefore for the court, not the jury. <i>United States v. Bishop,</i> 453 F.3d 30, 32 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Bennet claims that his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights were violated because the Government failed to properly plead and prove the ACCA enhancements. He asks us to find that as a matter of statutory construction, the ACCA requires the Government to charge his prior convictions in an indictment and prove them beyond a reasonable doubt. Bennett concedes that he did not raise this issue below. We thus review for plain error, which requires that the defendant show \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>Duarte,</i> 246 F.3d at 60. The district court committed no obvious error, since the text of the ACCA says nothing about pleading and proof of predicate convictions. Furthermore, we recently rejected in <i>United States v. McKenney</i> the constitutional argument that the Government must charge predicate convictions under the ACCA in an indictment, reiterating that \"[t]he Supreme Court has rejected the argument that under the Constitution, recidivism must be treated as an element of the offense, included in the indictment, and proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\" 450 F.3d 39, 45-46 (1st Cir.2006) (citing <i>Almendarez-Torres v. United States,</i> 523 U.S. 224, 239, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998)). As a result, the district court did not commit plain error in failing to apply the doctrine of constitutional avoidance by reading into the ACCA Bennett's proposed requirement. There is no constitutional issue and therefore nothing to avoid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm the sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Absent the USPO's determination that Bennett was an armed career criminal, Bennett would have been subject to an advisory guideline range of 24-30 months</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> There is some question as to whether Bennett preserved this argument for appeal.

Maness,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"669699\"><a href=\"/opinion/669699/united-states-v-jessie-lee-maness/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1006</span></a></span>, 1008-09 (6th Cir.1994) (finding that the same statute at issue in <i>Bowden</i> \"does not satisfy Taylor's definition of generic burglary\" because intent to commit a crime is a \"separate and distinct element[]\" from unlawful or unprivileged entry). In light of conflicting case law, any error that might have been committed by the district court was not \"obvious,\" and therefore not plain error. <i>United States v. Olano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span>, 734, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Constitutional and statutory claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bennett's remaining two claims merit little discussion. First, he claims that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated because the judge, rather than a jury, determined that his predicate conviction constituted a violent felony. Bennett suggests that <i>United States v. Booker,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></span> (2005), requires that the nature of his conviction be determined beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury. We very recently rejected the position that a jury must determine whether a prior conviction is a violent felony for purposes of a sentencing enhancement; the determination is a question of law and therefore for the court, not the jury. <i>United States v. Bishop,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202279\"><a href=\"/opinion/202279/united-states-v-bishop/\"><span class=\"volume\">453</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 32 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Bennet claims that his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights were violated because the Government failed to properly plead and prove the ACCA enhancements. He asks us to find that as a matter of statutory construction, the ACCA requires the Government to charge his prior convictions in an indictment and prove them beyond a reasonable doubt. Bennett concedes that he did not raise this issue below. We thus review for plain error, which requires that the defendant show \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>Duarte,</i> 246 F.3d at 60. The district court committed no obvious error, since the text of the ACCA says nothing about pleading and proof of predicate convictions. Furthermore, we recently rejected in <i>United States v. McKenney</i> the constitutional argument that the Government must charge predicate convictions under the ACCA in an indictment, reiterating that \"[t]he Supreme Court has rejected the argument that under the Constitution, recidivism must be treated as an element of the offense, included in the indictment, and proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202251\"><a href=\"/opinion/202251/united-states-v-mckenney/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span>, 45-46 (1st Cir.2006) (citing <i>Almendarez-Torres v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118188\"><a href=\"/opinion/118188/almendarez-torres-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></a></span>, 239, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118188\"><a href=\"/opinion/118188/almendarez-torres-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></a></span> (1998)). As a result, the district court did not commit plain error in failing to apply the doctrine of constitutional avoidance by reading into the ACCA Bennett's proposed requirement. There is no constitutional issue and therefore nothing to avoid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm the sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Absent the USPO's determination that Bennett was an armed career criminal, Bennett would have been subject to an advisory guideline range of 24-30 months</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> There is some question as to whether Bennett preserved this argument for appeal. He certainly did not develop the argument very well, focusing instead on whether his conviction satisfied the \"otherwise\" clause of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), but we will assume for purposes of this decision that he did preserve the argument below</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> In examining the record, a court is \"limited to the terms of the charging document, the terms of a plea agreement or transcript of colloquy between judge and defendant in which the factual basis for the plea was confirmed by the defendant, or to some comparable judicial record of this information.\"<i>Shepard v.
