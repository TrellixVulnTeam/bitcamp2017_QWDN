Jay A. Garcia-Gregory, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                        Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n                   Selya, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                     and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n       Nicolás Nogueras-Cartagena and Juan José Nolla-Acosta, on\nbrief, for appellant.\n    Luis Sánchez Betances, Sánchez-Betances, Sifre, and Muñoz-Noya\n& Rivera, P.S.C., on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n\n                            April 11, 2007\n\f              Per Curiam.      This case arises from Angela Lynn Zareas's\n\nallegation in a federal complaint that Luis Bared San Martin and\n\nAna Maria Bared Espinosa (the \"Bareds\") fraudulently deprived\n\nZareas of her property interest in an apartment she shared with her\n\nthen-husband, the Bareds' son.               The Bareds filed a motion to\n\ndismiss Zareas's complaint, arguing that it failed to allege the\n\nminimum    amount     in    controversy     required    for    federal   diversity\n\njurisdiction, see 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a), and that it neither stated\n\na claim on which relief could be granted under Federal Rule of\n\nCivil     Procedure        12(b)(6)   nor    pled      fraud    with     sufficient\n\nparticularity, as required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b).\n\nThe Bareds also argued that questions relating to the ownership and\n\ntransfer of the contested apartment – upon which Zareas's complaint\n\nwas predicated – had been litigated to a final judgment in the\n\nPuerto Rican courts and thus her claim was barred by principles of\n\nres judicata.       When the motion to dismiss went unanswered, the\n\ndistrict court dismissed Zareas's complaint for failure to oppose\n\nand for the reasons stated in the Bareds' motion.\n\n              Although Zareas raises several claims of error on appeal,\n\nwe do not reach them.          Zareas previously filed a federal lawsuit\n\nunder   the    Racketeer      Influenced    and   Corrupt      Organizations   Act\n\n(\"RICO\"), 18 U.S.C. § 1961 et. seq., alleging that the Bareds\n\nengaged in the fraudulent sale of duty-free goods, as a result of\n\nwhich she was deprived of her interest in the same property at\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fissue in this complaint. We affirmed the dismissal of that lawsuit\n\nin Zareas v. Bared-San Martin, 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 30994 (1st Cir.\n\nDec. 15, 2006), ruling that we could not reopen the issue of\n\nZareas's claim to own the property at issue in that claim:\n\n          [T]he ownership of the disputed property was\n          addressed in Zareas's divorce proceedings by\n          the Puerto Rico Court of First Instance and\n          the Puerto Rico Court of Appeals. Both courts\n          found that Zareas has no ownership interest in\n          the property.   This Court is bound by these\n          state court decisions pursuant to the full\n          faith and credit clause. 28 U.S.C. § 1738.\n\nId. at *3.\n\n          We   apply   federal   principles   of   res   judicata   in\n\ndetermining the import of this prior federal judgment.     See Semtek\n\nInt'l Inc. v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 531 U.S. 497, 507 (2001)\n\n(\"[W]e have long held that States cannot give . . . [federal court]\n\njudgments [in federal question cases] merely whatever effect they\n\nwould give their own judgments, but must accord them the effect\n\nthat this Court prescribes.\").    According to these principles, \"a\n\nfinal judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties or\n\ntheir privies from relitigating issues that were or could have been\n\nraised in that action.\"   Allen v. McCurry, 449 U.S. 90, 94 (1980).\n\nIn our opinion in the first federal action, we concluded that we\n\ncould not entertain Zareas's claim to own the property contested\n\nhere.   That final decision on the merits precludes our further\n\nreview of this issue.
