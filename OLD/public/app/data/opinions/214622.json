Gormley, P.C. were on brief for\nappellant.\n     Kelly Begg Lawrence, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Carmen M. Ortiz, United States Attorney, was on brief for\nappellee\n\n\n\n                         April 13, 2011\n\n\n\n\n     *\n      The Hon. David H. Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the\nSupreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.\n\f            BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.       Patrick Gomes was convicted in\n\nOctober 2008 on one count of conspiring to distribute cocaine base,\n\n21 U.S.C. § 846 (2006), and two counts of distribution of cocaine\n\nbase within a thousand feet of a school and/or aiding and abetting\n\nsuch distribution, 18 U.S.C. § 2 (2006); 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1),\n\n860.   On this appeal, Gomes claims that the prosecutor engaged in\n\nwitness    vouching   on   cross-examination   and   in   closing.    Some\n\nunderstanding of the trial evidence is necessary background.\n\n            The government's case was that Gomes had conspired with\n\nAlex Curet to distribute crack cocaine and had participated with\n\nCuret in two drug sales--one on September 25, 2007, and the other\n\non October 3, 2007--in which Curet sold a cooperating witness\n\n(\"CW\") crack cocaine.      In both sales, recordings offered at trial\n\ndisclosed Curet handing drugs to the CW and receiving money in\n\nreturn. The government alleged that Gomes acted as both driver and\n\nlookout.\n\n            In the September sale, the CW wore hidden recording\n\nequipment and made the exchange inside a car driven by Gomes.\n\nSeveral officers testified that they saw that car travel past their\n\nobservation points two or three times before coming to a stop, and\n\none officer noted that the occupants were looking around.            Gomes\n\nwas videotaped in the driver's seat during the drug deal, looking\n\nat the CW in the backseat and talking, and Gomes' attorney admitted\n\nin his opening statement that Gomes was \"watching what went on\"\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fduring the transaction.   Gomes' defense at trial was that he was\n\nmerely giving his friend a ride and looking for parking as he\n\ncruised; but a government witness said there had been no shortage\n\nof parking spaces.\n\n          The October sale occurred in a car driven by the CW and\n\ncontaining hidden cameras.   The video and audio recordings showed\n\nGomes to be present outside the car immediately before and after\n\nthe sale was made. In addition, Sergeant Detective John Fitzgerald\n\ntestified that he observed Gomes and Curet leave a car that Gomes\n\nhad driven; that Gomes went immediately to speak to the CW in the\n\nlatter's car and was looking back and forth even when speaking to\n\nthe CW; and that when Curet approached the CW to complete the sale,\n\nGomes continued scanning and also turned his body to shield the\n\ntransaction from view.\n\n          The strength of the government's case was Gomes' presence\n\nat both sales, his undeniable role as the driver in the first sale,\n\nand indications that he was performing surveillance for Curet as\n\nwell.   The weakness, if there was one, lay in the lack of any\n\nhandling by Gomes of either drugs or money and the absence of any\n\ndirectly incriminating statements by Gomes during or after the\n\nevent. Although Gomes was recorded in the second sale talking with\n\nthe CW just before the buy, the conversation was benign.\n\n          During his defense, Gomes did not testify but sought to\n\nimpeach Fitzgerald, primarily through the use of an expert of his\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fown.   Fitzgerald's testimony was especially significant since it\n\nidentified Gomes as driving Curet to the scene and playing a\n\nsecondary role in the sale itself.     Ultimately, the jury convicted\n\nGomes on all three counts, finding that each sale involved five\n\ngrams or more of cocaine base.   Gomes was sentenced to 78 months in\n\nprison, and he now appeals from his conviction on two grounds.\n\n          Gomes' first ground on appeal concerns the government's\n\ncross-examination of Gomes' expert witness, a former FBI agent,\n\nRichard Egan, who visited the scene and then offered testimony\n\nquestioning Fitzgerald's ability to see clearly what was happening\n\nduring the second sale.   Fitzgerald had witnessed the scene using\n\nbinoculars but from a vantage point that was 100-150 feet or more\n\naway from the sale.   Fitzgerald said his view was crystal clear;\n\nEgan said his own replication showed a chain fence and some foliage\n\ncomplicating the sight lines.\n\n          In the course of cross-examining Egan, the prosecutor\n\nasked questions that resulted in the following exchange:\n\n          Q.      And you have absolutely no basis to\n          dispute the statement in [Fitzgerald's] report\n          that from where he sat he had a clear view up\n          Woodward Avenue and a clear view down George\n          Street?\n          A.      His report is what it says.      And I\n          don't--I positioned myself where his report\n          put me, and I didn't see it as clearly as he\n          did.\n          Q.      But my question to you, sir, is you\n          have no basis for disputing his statement that\n          on October 3 that [sic] he had a clear view up\n          Woodward Avenue?\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f[GSA305:7-15]   At   this   point,   Gomes'   counsel   objected   to   the\n\nquestion as \"comment on another witness' testimony,\" and the\n\nobjection was overruled.     Thereafter the following ensued:\n\n          Q.     Now, when you were at the FBI, how\n          serious a matter was it to put false\n          statements in a report?\n          A.     It's always a serious matter.\n          Q.     How serious?\n          A.     It's going to get you fired or in jail.\n\n          On appeal, Gomes argues that in these exchanges the\n\nprosecutor engaged in \"improper vouching,\" which occurs where a\n\nprosecutor seeks to bolster the credibility of the witness--in this\n\ncase, Fitzgerald--by expressing his own opinion that the witness is\n\ntelling the truth.1 Counsel's personal belief is neither impartial\n\nnor relevant.   See Model Rules of Prof'l Conduct R. 3.4(e) (1983)\n\n(mandating that a lawyer shall not \"in trial, . . . state a\n\npersonal opinion as to . . . the credibility of a witness\").             A\n\nfurther concern is that the prosecutor may thereby \"place the\n\nprestige of the United States behind a witness.\"        United States v.\n\nTorres-Galindo, 206 F.3d 136, 140 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n\n\n     1\n      United States v. Castro-Davis, 612 F.3d 53, 66 (1st Cir.\n2010) (\"We have held that '[a] prosecutor improperly vouches for a\nwitness when she . . . impart[s] her personal belief . . . or\nimpli[es] that the jury should credit the prosecution's evidence\nsimply because the government can be trusted.'\" (quoting United\nStates v. Perez-Ruiz, 353 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2003), cert. denied,\n124 S. Ct. 2058 (2004))), cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 970 (2011); see\nalso United States v. Santana-Pérez, 619 F.3d 117, 122-23 (1st Cir.\n2010); United States v. Gentles, 619 F.3d 75, 83 (1st Cir.), cert.\ndenied, 131 S. Ct. 622 (2010); United States v. Flores-De-Jesús,\n569 F.3d 8, 18 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 130 S. Ct. 479 (2009).\n\n                                     -5-\n\f             The government says that the vouching objection was not\n\nadequately preserved by what defense counsel said to the judge\n\n(\"comment on another witness' testimony\") and that review should be\n\nonly for plain error.       Admittedly, vouching can be regarded as a\n\nspecies of comment and yet, so phrased, the objection is pretty\n\nuninformative.      But we need not decide whether the objection was\n\nclear enough in context, because the prosecutor's remarks were not\n\nvouching at all.\n\n             Although the quoted questions were intended to undermine\n\nEgan's testimony and thereby bolster Fitzgerald's credibility, this\n\ndoes not make them vouching. Thus, no \"vouching\" would be involved\n\nin asking Egan to explain what basis he had for questioning\n\nFitzgerald's testimony or whether a false report by an officer\n\nwould   be    a   serious   matter     (although    the   latter    might       be\n\nobjectionable for other reasons). This is all that occurred if one\n\nunderstands       the   prosecutor's       \"no   basis\"   remarks        to     be\n\ninterrogative--rather than intended as assertions that might then\n\nbe taken to express the prosecutor's own view.\n\n             Although    the   prosecutor's        \"questions\"     may        look\n\ngrammatically like assertions, the court reporter, who heard the\n\ntone of voice, understood both \"no basis\" sentences as questions,\n\nas the question marks in the transcript confirm.             The prosecutor\n\nmade clear in the second statement that he intended a question\n\n(\"But my question to you, sir, is . . .\").                 And the witness\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fseemingly took the statements as invitations to respond to what\n\nmost witnesses (and jurors) would probably have understood as a\n\n(hostile) request for a further explanation.\n\n            What defense counsel might have argued is that the quoted\n\npassages taken together approached a somewhat different question\n\noften regarded as improper, namely (in paraphrase), \"Are you, a\n\nformer   FBI   agent,   calling   the    government's   witness,   Sergeant\n\nDetective Fitzgerald, a liar?\"          See United States v. Thiongo, 344\n\nF.3d 55, 61 (1st Cir. 2003).      But that was not what the prosecutor\n\nliterally said, was not the objection in trial court, is not argued\n\non appeal, and is not by any means plain error under settled case\n\nlaw.\n\n            By contrast, Gomes' second claim of vouching--to which we\n\nnow turn--is technically stronger; it concerns a statement of the\n\nprosecutor during the government's rebuttal to Gomes' closing\n\nargument.      The full quotation, with the objectionable language\n\nemphasized for clarity, went as follows:\n\n            These are serious drugs.    And he just sits\n            there by the second buy? Okay, maybe you can\n            figure he was in a daze the first day.     He\n            didn't know what's going on. But the second\n            day, he knows exactly what's going on. Curet,\n            Perez, Curet, Perez. Oh, shoot. What does he\n            do? What he would have done, what he should\n            have done, if he was anything other than a\n            lookout, the kind of lookout that Dick Egan\n            told you was used all the time, is he would\n            have done what they did immediately after the\n            buy and what you saw them do on that video.\n            He would have walked across that street and\n            said, Get me out of here.      And he didn't\n\n                                    -7-\n\f          because Alex Curet was his man, because the\n          job for the day was being the lookout, because\n          John Fitzgerald gave you honest, candid,\n          truthful testimony.\n\n          The portion that we emphasize can be viewed as a personal\n\nassertion by the prosecutor, and the government's brief concedes it\n\ncrossed the line into vouching.        Formally, the statement is not\n\nexpressly a personal opinion and could have been intended, and\n\nperhaps understood, as merely a description of what the prosecutor\n\nwas urging the jury to conclude based on the evidence.         And, in\n\nfairness, it followed a rather strong attack on Fitzgerald's\n\nhonesty in defense counsel's own closing argument.\n\n          However,   the   prosecutor's    statement   could   also   be\n\nunderstood as an expression of his personal opinion and, if an\n\nobjection had been made during closing, the jury would have been\n\ntold that the prosecutor's own view was irrelevant and should have\n\nno weight in the jury's deliberations.      But no objection was made,\n\nand while the judge could have intervened on his own, experienced\n\ntrial judges are usually reluctant to pursue a matter that is not\n\nvery important and that defense counsel may want left alone rather\n\nthan emphasized even by a cautionary instruction.\n\n          An objection not preserved at trial can be pursued on\n\nappeal only if the error likely altered the outcome and created a\n\nmiscarriage of justice. United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 734-\n\n37 (1993).   Here, the government had a fairly strong case: a jury\n\nwould likely think that driving Curet to one drug deal might be\n\n                                 -8-\n\fmischance    but   that    driving    him     to    two   was   beyond   innocent\n\nexplanation.       And    even   if   some    of    Fitzgerald's    detail    were\n\ndisregarded, Gomes' approach to the CW's car was damning enough,\n\ntaken in conjunction with his behavior at the earlier sale.\n\n            Furthermore, the potential for harm from vouching varies,\n\nand it is likely to be more dangerous where the prosecutor flaunts\n\nthe government's skills and purity of motive or where the context\n\nor   the    prosecutor's     words    imply        private   knowledge   of   the\n\ndefendant's guilt that unfortunately cannot be shared with the\n\njury.   See, e.g., United States v. Manning, 23 F.3d 570, 572 (1st\n\nCir. 1994).     In this case, neither vice manifested itself.                 The\n\njury heard and saw Fitzgerald, and the prosecutor's favorable\n\nadjectives can only have added very little.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\f",

Thereafter the following ensued:\n\n          Q.     Now, when you were at the FBI, how\n          serious a matter was it to put false\n          statements in a report?\n          A.     It's always a serious matter.\n          Q.     How serious?\n          A.     It's going to get you fired or in jail.\n\n          On appeal, Gomes argues that in these exchanges the\n\nprosecutor engaged in \"improper vouching,\" which occurs where a\n\nprosecutor seeks to bolster the credibility of the witness--in this\n\ncase, Fitzgerald--by expressing his own opinion that the witness is\n\ntelling the truth.1 Counsel's personal belief is neither impartial\n\nnor relevant.   See Model Rules of Prof'l Conduct R. 3.4(e) (1983)\n\n(mandating that a lawyer shall not \"in trial, . . . state a\n\npersonal opinion as to . . . the credibility of a witness\").             A\n\nfurther concern is that the prosecutor may thereby \"place the\n\nprestige of the United States behind a witness.\"        United States v.\n\nTorres-Galindo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767957\"><a href=\"/opinion/767957/united-states-v-ricardo-torres-galindo-aka-ricky-silva-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">206</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">136</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 140 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n\n\n     1\n      United States v.

Admittedly, vouching can be regarded as a\n\nspecies of comment and yet, so phrased, the objection is pretty\n\nuninformative.      But we need not decide whether the objection was\n\nclear enough in context, because the prosecutor's remarks were not\n\nvouching at all.\n\n             Although the quoted questions were intended to undermine\n\nEgan's testimony and thereby bolster Fitzgerald's credibility, this\n\ndoes not make them vouching. Thus, no \"vouching\" would be involved\n\nin asking Egan to explain what basis he had for questioning\n\nFitzgerald's testimony or whether a false report by an officer\n\nwould   be    a   serious   matter     (although    the   latter    might       be\n\nobjectionable for other reasons). This is all that occurred if one\n\nunderstands       the   prosecutor's       \"no   basis\"   remarks        to     be\n\ninterrogative--rather than intended as assertions that might then\n\nbe taken to express the prosecutor's own view.\n\n             Although    the   prosecutor's        \"questions\"     may        look\n\ngrammatically like assertions, the court reporter, who heard the\n\ntone of voice, understood both \"no basis\" sentences as questions,\n\nas the question marks in the transcript confirm.             The prosecutor\n\nmade clear in the second statement that he intended a question\n\n(\"But my question to you, sir, is . . .\").                 And the witness\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fseemingly took the statements as invitations to respond to what\n\nmost witnesses (and jurors) would probably have understood as a\n\n(hostile) request for a further explanation.\n\n            What defense counsel might have argued is that the quoted\n\npassages taken together approached a somewhat different question\n\noften regarded as improper, namely (in paraphrase), \"Are you, a\n\nformer   FBI   agent,   calling   the    government's   witness,   Sergeant\n\nDetective Fitzgerald, a liar?\"          See United States v. Thiongo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200648\"><a href=\"/opinion/200648/united-states-v-thiongo/\"><span class=\"volume\">344</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 61 (1st Cir. 2003).      But that was not what the prosecutor\n\nliterally said, was not the objection in trial court, is not argued\n\non appeal, and is not by any means plain error under settled case\n\nlaw.\n\n            By contrast, Gomes' second claim of vouching--to which we\n\nnow turn--is technically stronger; it concerns a statement of the\n\nprosecutor during the government's rebuttal to Gomes' closing\n\nargument.      The full quotation, with the objectionable language\n\nemphasized for clarity, went as follows:\n\n            These are serious drugs.    And he just sits\n            there by the second buy? Okay, maybe you can\n            figure he was in a daze the first day.     He\n            didn't know what's going on. But the second\n            day, he knows exactly what's going on. Curet,\n            Perez, Curet, Perez. Oh, shoot. What does he\n            do? What he would have done, what he should\n            have done, if he was anything other than a\n            lookout, the kind of lookout that Dick Egan\n            told you was used all the time, is he would\n            have done what they did immediately after the\n            buy and what you saw them do on that video.\n            He would have walked across that street and\n            said, Get me out of here.      And he didn't\n\n                                    -7-\n\f          because Alex Curet was his man, because the\n          job for the day was being the lookout, because\n          John Fitzgerald gave you honest, candid,\n          truthful testimony.\n\n          The portion that we emphasize can be viewed as a personal\n\nassertion by the prosecutor, and the government's brief concedes it\n\ncrossed the line into vouching.        Formally, the statement is not\n\nexpressly a personal opinion and could have been intended, and\n\nperhaps understood, as merely a description of what the prosecutor\n\nwas urging the jury to conclude based on the evidence.         And, in\n\nfairness, it followed a rather strong attack on Fitzgerald's\n\nhonesty in defense counsel's own closing argument.\n\n          However,   the   prosecutor's    statement   could   also   be\n\nunderstood as an expression of his personal opinion and, if an\n\nobjection had been made during closing, the jury would have been\n\ntold that the prosecutor's own view was irrelevant and should have\n\nno weight in the jury's deliberations.      But no objection was made,\n\nand while the judge could have intervened on his own, experienced\n\ntrial judges are usually reluctant to pursue a matter that is not\n\nvery important and that defense counsel may want left alone rather\n\nthan emphasized even by a cautionary instruction.\n\n          An objection not preserved at trial can be pursued on\n\nappeal only if the error likely altered the outcome and created a\n\nmiscarriage of justice. United States v. Olano, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 734-\n\n37 (1993).   Here, the government had a fairly strong case: a jury\n\nwould likely think that driving Curet to one drug deal might be\n\n                                 -8-\n\fmischance    but   that    driving    him     to    two   was   beyond   innocent\n\nexplanation.       And    even   if   some    of    Fitzgerald's    detail    were\n\ndisregarded, Gomes' approach to the CW's car was damning enough,\n\ntaken in conjunction with his behavior at the earlier sale.\n\n            Furthermore, the potential for harm from vouching varies,\n\nand it is likely to be more dangerous where the prosecutor flaunts\n\nthe government's skills and purity of motive or where the context\n\nor   the    prosecutor's     words    imply        private   knowledge   of   the\n\ndefendant's guilt that unfortunately cannot be shared with the\n\njury.   See, e.g., United States v. Manning, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195356\"><a href=\"/opinion/195356/united-states-v-manning/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">570</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 572 (1st\n\nCir. 1994).     In this case, neither vice manifested itself.                 The\n\njury heard and saw Fitzgerald, and the prosecutor's favorable\n\nadjectives can only have added very little.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\f</pre>",
