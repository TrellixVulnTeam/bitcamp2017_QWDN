Joseph A. DiClerico, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                   Torruella, Lynch and Lipez,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Juan Rodríguez on brief pro se.\n     Jean B. Weld, Assistant U.S. Attorney and Thomas P.\nColantuono, United States Attorney on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                            March 30, 2007\n\f     Per   Curiam.     The   appellant       filed    suit    alleging   that    an\n\nadministrative forfeiture of $ 1905.00 violated due process because\n\nhe had contested the forfeiture, and he received no notices in the\n\nadministrative proceeding after an initial notice of seizure.                   The\n\ndistrict court dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nWe vacate and remand with instructions that the district court\n\nconsider the merits of the appellant's due process claims.\n\n     In dismissing for lack of subject matter, the district court\n\nread the appellant's complaint too narrowly. The appellant alleged\n\nthat DEA clearly misconstrued his petition by interpreting it as\n\nseeking only mitigation or remission.           He argued that if he had not\n\nintended to contest the forfeiture, he would have had no reason to\n\nfile the petition under oath (by the appropriate deadline), and\n\nargue that the money could not be forfeited because it was obtained\n\nlegally and intended for legitimate purposes.\n\n     A clear misconstrual of his petition states a due process\n\nclaim within the district court's subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nGonzalez-Gonzalez v. United States, 257 F.3d 31 (1st Cir. 2001);\n\nUnited   States   v.   Giraldo,   45    F.3d    509    (1st    Cir.   1995).    The\n\nappellant was entitled to an opportunity to be heard, with effect\n\ngiven to the substance of his petition. United States v. One 1987\n\nJeep Wrangler, 972 F.2d 472 (2nd Cir. 1992); Longenette v. Krusing,\n\n322 F.3d 758 (3rd. Cir. 2003); Scarabin v. Drug Enforcement Admin.,\n\n919 F.2d 337 (5th Cir. 1990); Marozsan v. United States, 852 F.2d\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\f1469 (7th Cir. 1988); Gete v. Immigration & Naturalization Serv.,\n\n121 F.3d 1285 (9th Cir. 1997).\n\n     Concerning the government's argument that the appellant never\n\nused the term 'claim', which goes to the merits of the claim, we\n\nnote that if special language was required, the notice should have\n\nsaid so. The appellant was entitled to notice that was not patently\n\nmisleading or uninformative. United States v. One Ford Coach, 307\n\nU.S. 219 (1939); Glasgov v. United States Drug Enforcement Admin.,\n\n12 F.3d 795 (8th Cir. 1993).\n\n     The appellant also claimed that the administrative proceeding\n\ndenied due process because he received no notices in the ongoing\n\nproceeding. He could neither correct DEA's misconstrual of his\n\npetition   nor   seek   timely   reconsideration   of   the   denial   of\n\nadministrative relief.\n\n     While certified mail may often satisfy due process, the\n\ninquiry is fact-specific. United States v. One Star Class Sloop\n\nSailboat, 458 F.3d 16, 22-3 (1st Cir. 2006). The district court did\n\nnot explore whether the notice was reasonable under the specific\n\ncircumstances of this case.      The record supported the appellant's\n\ncontention that MCI-Concord twice signed certified mail receipts on\n\nhis behalf when he was elsewhere, and DEA had some reason to know\n\nthat he was elsewhere. We have warned that \"the government must\n\nshow, if the issue is contested, that the notice was mailed to the\n\nprison in which the claimant was in fact being held.\" Whiting v.\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fUnited States, 231 F.3d 70, 76-77 (1st Cir. 2000).   See also United\n\nStates v. Williams, 130 Fed. App. 301 (11th Cir. 2005).   Moreover,\n\nif the government knew or had reason to know that the notice would\n\nnot reach the appellant then notice was inadequate. Jones v.\n\nFlowers, 126 S. Ct. 1708, 1717 (2006).\n\n     Finally, concerning MCI-Concord, we warn: \"if the government\n\nknew that mail delivery in a particular prison was unreliable but\n\nsent the notice by this means without any other precaution, mail\n\ndelivery would not satisfy due process.\"   Whiting, 231 F.3d at 77.\n\n     We vacate and remand with instructions that the district court\n\nentertain the merits of the appellant's claims.\n\n     So ordered.   1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.0(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                -4-\n\f",
