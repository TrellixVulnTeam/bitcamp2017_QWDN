Plaintiffs brought suit\n\nagainst Doral Financial Corporation and Doral Mortgage Corporation\n\n(collectively, \"Doral\") for violation of the federal Truth in\n\nLending Act (TILA), 15 U.S.C. §§ 1601-1667.                 Plaintiffs seek\n\nrescission of their home loans, and damages, based on Doral's\n\nalleged    failure   to    provide     them   sufficient   notice   of   their\n\nrescission rights.        The district court granted Doral's motion to\n\ndismiss plaintiffs' claims.          We affirm.\n\n                                I. Background\n\n            Because this case reaches us on appeal from the granting\n\nof a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n12(b)(6),   we   accept    as   true    plaintiffs'   well-pleaded   factual\n\nallegations.     See Rogan v. Menino, 175 F.3d 75, 77 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n            There are two sets of plaintiffs in this case. The first\n\nset, Johnny Santos-Rodriguez and Maria Betancourt-Castellanos (\"the\n\nSantoses\"), obtained an original home mortgage from Doral Mortgage\n\nin 1998.    By March 2004, the Santoses had defaulted on 34 payments\n\nunder the original loan.        To maintain their home, they elected to\n\nrefinance on March 13, 2004, again with Doral Mortgage.              The new\n\nloan totaled $78,750, of which $72,883.45 was used to pay off the\n\nprincipal and finance charges due under the original loan, thus\n\ncancelling that loan.       The parties dispute what was done with the\n\n$5,866.55 in additional proceeds from the refinancing.                   Doral\n\nargues that the entire amount was remitted to Doral as financing\n\n                                       -2-\n\fcharges,    while   the    Santoses   claim   that   one   month   after   the\n\ntransaction was finalized, they received $1,300 in proceeds from\n\nDoral.1    Within a year, Doral Mortgage assigned the Santoses' new\n\nloan to Doral Financial,2 which was the legal holder of the note at\n\nthe time this action was brought.\n\n            The second set of plaintiffs is composed of Lymary Rojas-\n\nMorales    and   Ranfi    Velez-Roman   (\"the   Rojases\").     The   Rojases\n\nobtained an original home mortgage with Doral Mortgage.3           On August\n\n27, 2003, the Rojases refinanced their original loan, again with\n\nDoral Mortgage.     The refinancing loan totaled $104,500, of which\n\n$94,035.83 went to pay the principal balance and finance charges\n\n\n     1\n      This factual disagreement is of potential import because the\nTILA rescission provisions do not apply to transactions \"which\nconstitute[] a refinancing or consolidation (with no new advances)\nof the principal balance then due and any accrued and unpaid\nfinance charges of an existing extension of credit by the same\ncreditor secured by an interest in the same property.\" 15 U.S.C.\n§ 1635(e)(2).    Doral alleges that the $1,300 remitted to the\nSantoses a month after the transaction was surplus escrow funds\naccumulated under the Santoses' original mortgage.        However,\nbecause this case reaches us on a motion to dismiss, we presume\nthat plaintiffs' allegation is correct: that the Santoses received\na new money advance as part of their refinance. See Rogan, 175\nF.3d at 77.\n     2\n      According to plaintiffs' complaint, Doral Mortgage is a\nwholly owned subsidiary of Doral Financial.\n     3\n      Because we accept as true plaintiffs' well-pleaded factual\nallegations, we cannot consider Doral's argument, which appears to\nhave factual support in the record, that the Rojases obtained their\noriginal home loan from Southern Mortgage, rather than Doral. If\ntrue, the Rojases' transaction was not a same-lender refinancing,\nmeaning that plaintiffs' central argument -- that same-lender\nrefinancing requires specialized disclosures -- would not apply to\nthe facts of the Rojases' transaction.\n\n                                      -3-\n\foutstanding on the Rojases' original loan, which was cancelled. Of\n\nthe   remaining   funds,    $6,251.76     went   to   Doral   Mortgage    for\n\nrefinancing fees, and $4,212.41 reverted to the Rojases as a new\n\nmoney advance.\n\n            Before closing on the refinancing loans, Doral provided\n\nthe Santoses and Rojases with a Notice of Right to Cancel.                The\n\nform was modeled on Federal Reserve Board Model Form H-8.           See 12\n\nC.F.R. § 226.23 (app. H-8).          Both sets of plaintiffs received\n\nidentical   disclosure     forms,   and   they   acknowledged   receipt    by\n\nsigning the documents.      Below, we excerpt the relevant sections of\n\nthe disclosure form that plaintiffs received:\n\n            You are entering into a transaction that will\n            result in a mortgage, lien or security\n            interest on your home. You have a legal right\n            under federal law to cancel this transaction,\n            without cost, within three business days . . .\n\n            If you cancel the transaction, the mortgage,\n            lien or security interest is also cancelled.\n\n            If you decide to cancel this transaction, you\n            may do so by notifying us in writing . . . .\n            You may use any written statement that is\n            signed and dated by you and states your\n            intention to cancel, or you may use this\n            notice by dating and signing below.\n\n            The TILA grants consumers a three-day rescission period\n\nfor any consumer credit transaction where a security interest will\n\nbe acquired by the lender in the consumer's principal dwelling. 15\n\nU.S.C. § 1635(a).    This three-day rescission period begins to run\n\nwhen the transaction is consummated or upon delivery of notice of\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fthe consumer's right to rescind, whichever occurs later.              Id.\n\nHowever, the three-day rescission period is extended to three years\n\nif the lender fails to meet the disclosure requirements of the\n\nTILA.    15 U.S.C. § 1635(f).     The Federal Reserve Board (FRB) has\n\nissued an implementing regulation known as Regulation Z, which\n\ngoverns, among other things, the disclosures that lenders must make\n\nto consumers.   12 C.F.R. § 226.1 et seq.         Regulation Z includes an\n\nappendix   of   model    forms   for    various   consumer   transactions,\n\nincluding Model Forms H-8 and H-9, which are at issue here.         See 12\n\nC.F.R. § 226.23 (app. H-8, H-9).\n\n           In 2005, plaintiffs informed Doral of their intention to\n\nrescind their refinance loans, arguing that Doral's alleged failure\n\nto disclose properly their rescission rights had extended the\n\nrescission period to three years. Thereafter, Doral issued written\n\nrejections of plaintiffs' attempts to rescind.               In response,\n\nplaintiffs brought suit against Doral, originally framed as a class\n\naction,4 in the United States District Court for the District of\n\nPuerto Rico, seeking rescission of their loans, and statutory and\n\nactual damages.         The district court granted Doral's motion to\n\n\n\n     4\n      In their complaint, plaintiffs purported to bring their\nclaims on behalf of two classes of similarly situated consumers.\nHowever, the district court dismissed plaintiffs' claims in their\nentirety before the litigation reached the class certification\nstage.    In any event, we have recently held that class\ncertification is not available for rescission claims brought under\nthe TILA. See McKenna v. First Horizon Home Loan Corp., 475 F.3d\n418, 423 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n                                       -5-\n\fdismiss for failure to state a claim, holding that Doral met its\n\ndisclosure obligations by clearly and conspicuously informing the\n\nplaintiffs of their rescission rights.           Plaintiffs now appeal the\n\ndismissal of their claims.\n\n                                II. Discussion\n\n              We review de novo the grant of a motion to dismiss for\n\nfailure to state a claim, \"accepting all well-pleaded facts as true\n\nand giving the party who has pleaded the contested claim the\n\nbenefit      of   all   reasonable   inferences.\"        Palmer   v.   Champion\n\nMortgage, 465 F.3d 24, 27 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n              Plaintiffs make two arguments to support their assertion\n\nthat the rescission period for their refinance transactions should\n\nbe extended from three days to three years.               First, they allege\n\nthat Doral failed to comply with the TILA's disclosure requirements\n\nbecause it gave plaintiffs a form patterned on Model Form H-8,\n\nwhich   is    designed    for   general   transactions,     rather     than   one\n\npatterned on Model Form H-9, which is designed for same-lender\n\nrefinancing transactions.            See 61 Fed. Reg. 49,237-02 (1996).\n\nSecond, plaintiffs argue that the form Doral used was misleading\n\nbecause it did not adequately explain the effects of rescinding a\n\nsame-lender refinancing loan, as opposed to an original loan.                  We\n\ntake these arguments in turn.\n\n              Plaintiffs'    first   approach   is   a   non-starter.         They\n\ninsist, despite clear statutory and regulatory language to the\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fcontrary, that \"if the creditor does not provide the 'appropriate\n\nform,' the borrower 'shall have' rescission rights.\"                      This is\n\nsimply   incorrect.      The    statute     permits   the   lender   to    inform\n\nconsumers of their rescission rights by using \"the appropriate form\n\nof written notice published and adopted by the [Federal Reserve]\n\nBoard,   or    a   comparable   written     notice    of   the   rights   of   the\n\nobligor.\" 15 U.S.C. § 1635(h) (emphasis added). The plain meaning\n\nof the word \"or\" makes clear that the lender may comply with its\n\ndisclosure obligations by using a model form or, alternatively, a\n\ncomparable written notice.          Regulation Z is equally clear that\n\neither type of notice will satisfy the lender's obligation: \"To\n\nsatisfy the disclosure requirement . . . the creditor shall provide\n\nthe appropriate model       form in Appendix H of this part or a\n\nsubstantially similar notice.\"        12 C.F.R. § 226.23(b)(2) (emphasis\n\nadded). In addition, the TILA plainly states that use of the model\n\nforms is not obligatory.        See 15 U.S.C. § 1604(b) (\"Nothing in this\n\nsubchapter may be construed to require a creditor or lessor to use\n\nany such model form or clause prescribed by the Board under this\n\nsection.\").\n\n              In sum, because the plain language of the statute and\n\nregulations does not require exclusive use of the model forms,\n\nplaintiffs are incorrect to insist that Doral's alleged failure to\n\n\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fprovide the appropriate FRB form is a per se violation of 15 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1635 and Regulation Z.5\n\n                 Plaintiffs' second argument requires more analysis. They\n\nassert that Doral's use of a form patterned on Model Form H-8\n\nrather than H-9 significantly misled them as to their rescission\n\nrights, because the effects of rescinding a same-lender refinance\n\nloan are different from the effects of rescinding an original loan.\n\nIn particular, plaintiffs highlight that the form they received\n\nfailed to disclose that if a same-lender refinancing loan is\n\nrescinded, the original loan is not cancelled, meaning that the\n\nlender retains a security interest in the property under the\n\noriginal loan, and the consumer reverts to paying off the original\n\nloan.       Plaintiffs argue that a consumer would be less willing to\n\nrescind a same-lender refinance loan if he believed that as a\n\nresult      he    would   also    have   to    repay   the   original   mortgage.\n\n                 Our   analysis   of   this   argument   must   start   with   the\n\ndisclosure standard set forth in the TILA, which requires that\n\nlenders \"clearly and conspicuously disclose\" borrowers' rescission\n\n\n\n        5\n      While the facts in this case do not require us to reach the\nissue, we have previously noted that there is statutory and case\nlaw support for the proposition that the model forms provide\nlenders a safe harbor protection whereby \"adherence to a model form\nbars a TILA non-disclosure claim entirely.\" Palmer v. Champion\nMortgage, 465 F.3d 24, 29 n.5 (1st Cir. 2006); see also 15 U.S.C.\n§ 1604(b) (\"The Board shall publish model disclosure forms and\nclauses for common transactions to facilitate compliance with the\ndisclosure requirements of this subchapter . . . .\") (emphasis\nadded).\n\n                                         -8-\n\frights.   15 U.S.C. § 1635(a).    Regulation Z elaborates on this\n\ndisclosure standard by listing the five elements of clear and\n\nconspicuous disclosure:\n\n          The notice shall be on a separate document\n          that identifies the transaction and shall\n          clearly   and  conspicuously disclose  the\n          following:\n\n          (i) The retention or acquisition of a security\n          interest in the consumer's principal dwelling.\n          (ii) The consumer's right to rescind the\n          transaction.\n          (iii) How to exercise the right to rescind,\n          with a form for that purpose, designating the\n          address of the creditor's place of business.\n          (iv) The effects of rescission, as described\n          in paragraph (d) of this section.\n          (v) The date the rescission period expires.\n\n12 C.F.R. § 226.23(b)(1). The fourth element, requiring disclosure\n\nof the effects of rescission, is further explained at 12 C.F.R. §\n\n226.23(d), which delineates several effects of rescission that must\n\nbe disclosed to the consumer, including:\n\n          (1) When a consumer rescinds a transaction,\n          the security interest giving rise to the right\n          of rescission becomes void and the consumer\n          shall not be liable for any amount, including\n          any finance charge.\n          (2) Within 20 calendar days after receipt of a\n          notice of rescission, the creditor shall\n          return any money or property that has been\n          given to anyone in connection with the\n          transaction   and   shall  take   any   action\n          necessary to reflect the termination of the\n          security interest.\n          (3) If the creditor has delivered any money or\n          property, the consumer may retain possession\n          until the creditor has met its obligation\n          under paragraph (d)(2) of this section. When\n          the creditor has complied with that paragraph,\n          the consumer shall tender the money or\n\n                                 -9-\n\f            property to the creditor or, where the latter\n            would be impracticable or inequitable, tender\n            its reasonable value.\n\nId.\n\n            Most courts have concluded that the TILA's clear and\n\nconspicuous standard is less demanding than a requirement of\n\nperfect notice.6       See, e.g., Veale v. Citibank, 85 F.3d 577, 581\n\n(11th Cir. 1996), cert. denied 520 U.S. 1198 (1997) (\"TILA does not\n\nrequire perfect notice; rather it requires a clear and conspicuous\n\nnotice of rescission rights.\"); Smith v. Chapman, 614 F.2d 968, 972\n\n(5th Cir. 1980) (\"Strict compliance does not necessarily mean\n\npunctilious compliance if, with minor deviations from the language\n\ndescribed   in   the    Act,   there   is   still   a   substantial,   clear\n\ndisclosure of the fact or information demanded by the applicable\n\nstatute or regulation.\"); Dixon v. D.H. Holmes Co., 566 F.2d 571,\n\n573 (5th Cir. 1978) (\"The question is not whether [notice provided\n\n\n\n      6\n      We do not follow the Seventh Circuit's view that \"TILA does\nnot easily forgive 'technical' errors.\" Handy v. Anchor Mortgage\nCorp., 464 F.3d 760, 764 (7th Cir. 2006) (quoting Cowen v. Bank\nUnited of Texas, 70 F.3d 937, 941 (7th Cir. 1995)).        As the\nEleventh Circuit has explained, Congress in 1995 rejected this\nhyper-technical view of the TILA, by imposing a temporary\nmoratorium on TILA class actions and then amending the statute out\nof concern that courts were \"allow[ing] plaintiffs to rescind a\nmortgage as a result of minor TILA violations.\" Smith, 108 F.3d at\n1327 n.4.   In response to Congress's actions, most courts have\nadopted the clear and conspicuous standard in place of a rule of\nhyper-technicality. We believe this is the correct position, as we\nhave recently stated. See McKenna, 475 F.3d at 424 (\"In taking\nthis step, Congress made manifest that . . . it had not intended\nthat lenders would be made to face overwhelming liability for\nrelatively minor violations.\").\n\n                                   -10-\n\funder the TILA] is capable of semantic improvement but whether it\n\ncontains a substantial and accurate disclosure . . . .\"); see also\n\nFord Motor Credit Co. v. Milhollin, 444 U.S. 555, 568 (1980)\n\n(\"Meaningful   disclosure    [under   the    TILA]    does   not   mean   more\n\ndisclosure.     Rather, it describes a balance between competing\n\nconsiderations of complete disclosure . . . and the need to avoid\n\n. . . [information overload].\") (internal quotation and citation\n\nomitted) (emphasis in original).      As this court has recently said,\n\nthe 1995 TILA amendments, see Truth in Lending Act Amendments of\n\n1995, Pub. L. No. 104-29, 109 Stat. 271, 272-73, were intended by\n\nCongress to \"provide higher tolerance levels for what it viewed as\n\nhonest mistakes in carrying out disclosure obligations.\"            McKenna,\n\n475 F.3d at 424.\n\n          Thus, the key question in this case is whether Doral\n\nclearly and conspicuously informed plaintiffs of their right of\n\nrescission    and   the   effects   thereof,    in    compliance   with    the\n\nrequirements laid out in Regulation Z.         We conclude that Doral met\n\nits   disclosure    obligations.       The     form   plaintiffs    received\n\nexplained, among other things, that (1) they were entering a\n\ntransaction that would result in a mortgage on their home; (2) they\n\nhad a legal right to rescind \"this transaction,\" without cost,\n\nwithin three days; and (3) if they were to rescind the transaction,\n\nthe mortgage that would have been created by the refinancing\n\ntransaction would also be cancelled.            Because the form clearly\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fstated that rescission was available only as to \"this transaction,\"\n\nDoral    clearly      and    conspicuously       informed      plaintiffs      that    any\n\nrescission         would    only   operate     as   to   the    current      refinancing\n\ntransaction.\n\n              In addition, the form that plaintiffs received satisfied\n\n12 C.F.R. § 226.23(d), which details the effects of rescission that\n\nmust be disclosed.             Most importantly, Doral's disclosure form\n\ninformed plaintiffs that, \"If you cancel the transaction, the\n\nmortgage, lien or security interest is also cancelled.\"                               This\n\nstatement fulfilled the regulatory requirement that the lender\n\ndisclose that, upon rescission of the current transaction \"the\n\nsecurity interest giving rise to the right of rescission becomes\n\nvoid.\"        12    C.F.R.    §    226.23(d)(1).         Contrary       to   plaintiffs'\n\nassertion,         this    disclosure     is   accurate        even     in   same-lender\n\nrefinance      transactions        such   as    those    at    issue     here,   because\n\nrescission of a refinance transaction does indeed cancel the entire\n\nsecurity interest contemplated by the refinance agreement.                              In\n\naddition, rescission of the refinance transaction does not impact\n\nthe lender's security interest under the original loan, which is\n\nheld in abeyance until the rescission period has expired.                        See 12\n\nC.F.R.    §    226.23(c)      (\"Unless     a   consumer        waives    the   right    of\n\nrescission . . . no money shall be disbursed other than in escrow,\n\nno services shall be performed and no materials delivered until the\n\nrescission period has expired and the creditor is reasonably\n\n\n                                          -12-\n\fsatisfied that the consumer has not rescinded.\").          Here, because\n\nDoral's     disclosure   correctly    stated   that   rescission   of   the\n\nrefinance loan would cancel the security interest contemplated by\n\nthat loan, and would impact only the refinance transaction, it\n\nsatisfactorily disclosed the effects of rescission as required by\n\n12 C.F.R. § 226.23(d).7\n\n             That said, it is true that the disclosure statement\n\nplaintiffs received did not affirmatively inform them, as the H-9\n\nform would have, that rescission of the refinance transaction would\n\nnot also rescind their original mortgage.8            However, we do not\n\nrequire perfect disclosure.     The question before us is not whether\n\n\n     7\n      In its 1996 commentary to the revised regulations, the FRB\nclarified that Model Form H-9 could be used for same-lender\nrefinances where \"the original note and mortgage are extinguished\nand new documents are executed to cover both the outstanding debt\nand the amount borrowed in the new transaction.\"      61 Fed. Reg.\n49,237-02 (1996). However, the FRB's statement that Model Form H-9\ncould be used in such a transaction does not mean that use of that\nform is required.     Indeed, because the TILA does not require\nlenders to use the model forms, the only test for compliance is\nwhether the notice actually given informed the consumer clearly and\nconspicuously of his rights and obligations, consistent with\nRegulation Z.\n     8\n         Model Form H-9 explains, in part:\n\n             If you cancel this new transaction, it will\n             not affect any amount that you presently owe.\n             Your home is the security for that amount.\n             Within 20 calendar days after we receive your\n             notice   of   cancellation    of   this   new\n             transaction, we must take the steps necessary\n             to reflect the fact that your home does not\n             secure the increase of credit.\n\nSee 12 C.F.R. § 226.23 (app. H-9).\n\n                                     -13-\n\fthe notification in Form H-9 would have been more complete than the\n\nnotification plaintiffs actually received, but only whether the\n\nnotification plaintiffs actually received met the requirements of\n\nthe clear and conspicuous standard laid out in Regulation Z.\n\nEvaluating, as we must, Doral's disclosure from the vantage point\n\nof the hypothetical average consumer, see Palmer, 465 F.3d at 28,\n\nwe   conclude    that   because   plaintiffs   were    told,   clearly   and\n\nconspicuously, that rescission would only operate as to their\n\npending refinance transaction, any conclusions that they might have\n\ndrawn     from   that   disclosure   about   their    previously   existing\n\nmortgages were unreasonable (and, thus, not a valid basis for any\n\nTILA claim).9     See Gambardella v. G. Fox & Co., 716 F.2d 104, 118\n\n(2d Cir. 1983) (TILA disclosure that \"requires the consumer to\n\nexercise some degree of care and study\" suffices and \"perfect\n\ndisclosure\" is not required).        Two other circuits (albeit only one\n\n\n      9\n      Plaintiffs cite two cases in an attempt to rebut this\nconclusion. Neither is helpful to their cause. The first, Handy\nv. Anchor Mortgage Corp., 464 F.3d 760 (7th Cir. 2006), is not\npersuasive for two reasons. First, Handy adopts a hyper-technical\ncompliance requirement, a position we have rejected. See McKenna,\n475 F.3d at 424. Second, Handy's facts are quite different from\nthose here. In Handy, the court concluded that the consumer was\nnot clearly informed of her rescission rights where she received\nboth Model Form H-8 and H-9, and her loan was an original\ntransaction, rather than a refinance. 464 F.3d at 764. Plaintiffs\nalso cite our recent decision in Palmer, 465 F.3d at 24. However,\nour conclusion here is consistent with Palmer, which held that we\nreview the adequacy of a lender's notice under the standard of\nobjective reasonableness. Id. at 28 (\"[W]e, like other courts,\nhave focused the lens of our inquiry on the text of the disclosures\nthemselves rather than on plaintiffs' descriptions of their\nsubjective understandings.\").\n\n                                     -14-\n\fin a published opinion) have reached this same conclusion, where\n\nModel Form H-8, or a form patterned on it, was used for a same-\n\nlender refinancing transaction.       See Veale, 85 F.3d at 580 (\"We\n\nhold that . . . the H-8 form provides sufficient notice that the\n\ncurrent transaction may be canceled but that previous transactions,\n\nincluding previous mortgages, may not be rescinded.\");10 Mills v.\n\nEquiCredit   Corp.,   172   Fed.   Appx.   652,   656   (6th   Cir.   2006)\n\n(approving of the district court's conclusion that \"assuming that\n\nthe form used by EquiCredit was technically incorrect . . . the\n\nform nonetheless informed Appellants of their right to cancel the\n\nloan transaction\") (unpublished opinion). Doral's disclosures were\n\nnot perfect in this case, but they were sufficient to meet the\n\nstatutory and regulatory requirements of the TILA and Regulation Z.\n\nSee Palmer, 465 F.3d at 29 (\"[A]ny creditor who uses plain and\n\nlegally sufficient language ought to be held harmless.\").\n\n                            III. Conclusion\n\n          For the reasons given above, we AFFIRM the district\n\ncourt's dismissal of plaintiffs' claims.\n\n\n\n\n     10\n      Plaintiffs assert that Veale is no longer good law because\nsubsequent amendments and regulatory changes have overruled Veale.\nThis argument is unpersuasive. Plaintiffs maintain that the 1995\ncongressional amendments to the TILA meant that \"a creditor's use\nof the wrong model disclosure form . . . would not be protected.\"\nThis is incorrect, for the simple reason that the TILA does not\nrequire use of the model forms at all.      In addition, as noted\nearlier, supra n.6, the 1995 amendments were intended to reduce,\nnot increase, lender liability for minor violations.\n\n                                   -15-\n\f",

Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because this case reaches us on appeal from the granting of a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), we accept as true plaintiffs' well-pleaded factual allegations. <i>See Rogan v. Menino,</i> 175 F.3d 75, 77 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two sets of plaintiffs in this case. The first set, Johnny Santos-Rodriguez and Maria Betancourt-Castellanos (\"the Santoses\"), obtained an original home mortgage from Doral Mortgage in 1998. By March 2004, the Santoses had defaulted on 34 payments under the original loan. To maintain their home, they elected to refinance on March 13, 2004, again with Doral Mortgage. The new loan totaled $78,750, of which $72,883.45 was used to pay off the principal and finance charges due under the original loan, thus canceling that loan. The parties dispute what was done with the $5,866.55 in additional proceeds from the refinancing. Doral argues that the entire amount was remitted to Doral as financing charges, while the Santoses claim that one month after the transaction was finalized, they received $1,300 in proceeds from Doral.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Within a year, Doral Mortgage assigned the Santoses' new loan to Doral Financial,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> which was the legal holder of the note at the time this action was brought.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second set of plaintiffs is composed of Lymary Rojas-Morales and Ranfi Velez-Roman (\"the Rojases\"). The Rojases obtained an original home mortgage with Doral Mortgage.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> On August 27, 2003, the Rojases refinanced their original loan, again with Doral Mortgage. The refinancing loan totaled $104,500, of which $94,035.83 went to pay the principal balance and finance charges outstanding on the Rojases' original loan, which was cancelled. Of the remaining funds, $6,251.76 went to Doral Mortgage for refinancing fees, and $4,212.41 reverted to the Rojases as a new money advance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before closing on the refinancing loans, Doral provided the Santoses and Rojases with a Notice of Right to Cancel. The form was modeled on Federal Reserve Board Model Form H-8. <i>See</i> 12 C.F.R. &#167; 226.23 (app. H-8). Both sets of plaintiffs received identical disclosure forms, and they acknowledged receipt by signing the documents. Below, we excerpt the relevant sections of the disclosure form that plaintiffs received:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You are entering into a transaction that will result in a mortgage, lien or security interest on your home. You have a legal right under federal law to cancel this transaction, without cost, within three business days ...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If you cancel the transaction, the mortgage, lien or security interest is also cancelled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If you decide to cancel this transaction, you may do so by notifying us in writing.... You may use any written statement that is signed and dated by you and states your intention to cancel, or you may use this notice by dating and signing below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The TILA grants consumers a three-day rescission period for any consumer credit transaction where a security interest will be acquired by the lender in the consumer's principal dwelling. 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1635(a). This three-day rescission period begins to run when the transaction is consummated or upon delivery of notice of the consumer's right to rescind, whichever occurs later. <i>Id.</i> However, the three-day rescission period is extended to three years if the lender fails to meet the disclosure requirements of the TILA. 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1635(f). The Federal Reserve Board (FRB) has issued an implementing regulation known as Regulation Z, which governs, among other things, the disclosures that lenders must make to consumers. 12 C.F.R. &#167; 226.1 <i>et seq.</i> Regulation Z includes an appendix of model forms for various consumer transactions, including Model Forms H-8 and H-9, which are at issue here. <i>See</i> 12 C.F.R. &#167; 226.23 (app. H-8, H-9).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 2005, plaintiffs informed Doral of their intention to rescind their refinance loans, arguing that Doral's alleged failure to disclose properly their rescission rights had extended the rescission period to three years. Thereafter, Doral issued written rejections of plaintiffs' attempts to rescind. In response, plaintiffs brought suit against Doral, originally framed as a class action,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, seeking rescission of their loans, and statutory and actual damages. The district court granted Doral's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, holding that Doral met its disclosure obligations by clearly and conspicuously informing the plaintiffs of their rescission rights. Plaintiffs now appeal the dismissal of their claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review <i>de novo</i> the grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, \"accepting all well-pleaded facts as true and giving the party who has pleaded the contested claim the benefit of all reasonable inferences.\" <i>Palmer v. Champion Mortgage,</i> 465 F.3d 24, 27 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs make two arguments to support their assertion that the rescission period for their refinance transactions should be extended from three days to three years. First, they allege that Doral failed to comply with the TILA's disclosure requirements because it gave plaintiffs a form patterned on Model Form H-8, which is designed for general transactions, rather than one patterned on Model Form H-9, which is designed for same-lender refinancing transactions. <i>See</i> 61 Fed. Reg. 49,237-02 (1996). Second, plaintiffs argue that the form Doral used was misleading because it did not adequately explain the effects of rescinding a same-lender refinancing loan, as opposed to an original loan. We take these arguments in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' first approach is a non-starter. They insist, despite clear statutory and regulatory language to the contrary, that \"if the creditor does not provide the `appropriate form,' the borrower `shall have' rescission rights.\" This is simply incorrect. The statute permits the lender to inform consumers of their rescission rights by using \"the appropriate form of written notice published and adopted by the [Federal Reserve] Board, <i>or a comparable written notice</i> of the rights of the obligor.\" 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1635(h) (emphasis added). The plain meaning of the word \"or\" makes clear that the lender may comply with its disclosure obligations by using a model form or, alternatively, a comparable written notice. Regulation Z is equally clear that either type of notice will satisfy the lender's obligation: \"To satisfy the disclosure requirement ... the creditor shall provide the appropriate model form in Appendix H of this part <i>or a substantially similar notice.</i>\" 12 C.F.R. &#167; 226.23(b)(2) (emphasis added). In addition, the TILA plainly states that use of the model forms is not obligatory. <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1604(b) (\"Nothing in this subchapter may be construed to require a creditor or lessor to use any such model form or clause prescribed by the Board under this section.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, because the plain language of the statute and regulations does not require exclusive use of the model forms, plaintiffs are incorrect to insist that Doral's alleged failure to provide the appropriate FRB form is a per se violation of 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1635 and Regulation Z.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' second argument requires more analysis. They assert that Doral's use of a form patterned on Model Form H-8 rather than H-9 significantly misled them as to their rescission rights, because the effects of rescinding a same-lender refinance loan are different from the effects of rescinding an original loan. In particular, plaintiffs highlight that the form they received failed to disclose that if a same-lender refinancing loan is rescinded, the original loan is not cancelled, meaning that the lender retains a security interest in the property under the original loan, and the consumer reverts to paying off the original loan. Plaintiffs argue that a consumer would be less willing to rescind a same-lender refinance loan if he believed that as a result he would also have to repay the original mortgage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our analysis of this argument must start with the disclosure standard set forth in the TILA, which requires that lenders \"clearly and conspicuously disclose\" borrowers' rescission rights. 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1635(a). Regulation Z elaborates on this disclosure standard by listing the five elements of clear and conspicuous disclosure:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The notice shall be on a separate document that identifies the transaction and shall clearly and conspicuously disclose the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) The retention or acquisition of a security interest in the consumer's principal dwelling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) The consumer's right to rescind the transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(iii) How to exercise the right to rescind, with a form for that purpose, designating the address of the creditor's place of business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(iv) The effects of rescission, as described in paragraph (d) of this section.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(v) The date the rescission period expires.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">12 C.F.R. &#167; 226.23(b)(1). The fourth element, requiring disclosure of the effects of rescission, is further explained at 12 C.F.R. &#167; 226.23(d), which delineates several effects of rescission that must be disclosed to the consumer, including:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) When a consumer rescinds a transaction, the security interest giving rise to the right of rescission becomes void and the consumer shall not be liable for any amount, including any finance charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) Within 20 calendar days after receipt of a notice of rescission, the creditor shall return any money or property that has been given to anyone in connection with the transaction and shall take any action necessary to reflect the termination of the security interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) If the creditor has delivered any money or property, the consumer may retain possession until the creditor has met its obligation under paragraph (d)(2) of this section. When the creditor has complied with that paragraph, the consumer shall tender the money or property to the creditor or, where the latter would be impracticable or inequitable, tender its reasonable value.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Id.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most courts have concluded that the TILA's clear and conspicuous standard is less demanding than a requirement of perfect notice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>See, e.g., Veale v.

No. 104-29, 109 Stat. 271, 272-73, were intended by Congress to \"provide higher tolerance levels for what it viewed as honest mistakes in carrying out disclosure obligations.\" <i>McKenna,</i> 475 F.3d at 424.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the key question in this case is whether Doral clearly and conspicuously informed plaintiffs of their right of rescission and the effects thereof, in compliance with the requirements laid out in Regulation Z. We conclude that Doral met its disclosure obligations. The form plaintiffs received explained, among other things, that (1) they were entering a transaction that would result in a mortgage on their home; (2) they had a legal right to rescind \"this transaction,\" without cost, within three days; and (3) if they were to rescind the transaction, the mortgage that would have been created by the refinancing transaction would also be cancelled. Because the form clearly stated that rescission was available only as to \"this transaction,\" Doral clearly and conspicuously informed plaintiffs that any rescission would only operate as to the current refinancing transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the form that plaintiffs received satisfied 12 C.F.R. &#167; 226.23(d), which details the effects of rescission that must be disclosed. Most importantly, Doral's disclosure form informed plaintiffs that, \"If you cancel the transaction, the mortgage, lien or security interest is also cancelled.\" This statement fulfilled the regulatory requirement that the lender disclose that, upon rescission of the current transaction \"the security interest giving rise to the right of rescission becomes void.\" 12 C.F.R. &#167; 226.23(d)(1). Contrary to plaintiffs' assertion, this disclosure is accurate even in same-lender refinance transactions such as those at issue here, because rescission of a refinance transaction does indeed cancel the entire security interest contemplated by the refinance agreement. In addition, rescission of the refinance transaction does not impact the lender's security interest under the original loan, which is held in abeyance until the rescission period has expired. <i>See</i> 12 C.F.R. &#167; 226.23(c) (\"Unless a consumer waives the right of rescission ... no money shall be disbursed other than in escrow, no services shall be performed and no materials delivered until the rescission period has expired and the creditor is reasonably satisfied that the consumer has not rescinded.\"). Here, because Doral's disclosure correctly stated that rescission of the refinance loan would cancel the security interest contemplated by that loan, and would impact only the refinance transaction, it satisfactorily disclosed the effects of rescission as required by 12 C.F.R. &#167; 226.23(d).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That said, it is true that the disclosure statement plaintiffs received did not affirmatively inform them, as the H-9 form would have, that rescission of the refinance transaction would not also rescind their original mortgage.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> However, we do not require perfect disclosure. The question before us is not whether the notification in Form H-9 would have been more complete than the notification plaintiffs actually received, but only whether the notification plaintiffs actually received met the requirements of the clear and conspicuous standard laid out in Regulation Z. Evaluating, as we must, Doral's disclosure from the vantage point of the hypothetical average consumer, <i>see Palmer,</i> 465 F.3d at 28, we conclude that because plaintiffs were told, clearly and conspicuously, that rescission would only operate as to their pending refinance transaction, any conclusions that they might have drawn from that disclosure about their previously existing mortgages were unreasonable (and, thus, not a valid basis for any TILA claim).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> <i>See Gambardella v. G. Fox &amp; Co.,</i> 716 F.2d 104, 118 (2d Cir.1983) (TILA disclosure that \"requires the consumer to exercise some degree of care and study\" suffices and \"perfect disclosure\" is not required). Two other circuits (albeit only one in a published opinion) have reached this same conclusion, where Model Form H-8, or a form patterned on it, was used for a same-lender refinancing transaction. <i>See Veale,</i> 85 F.3d at 580 (\"We hold that ... the H-8 form provides sufficient notice that the current transaction may be canceled but that previous transactions, including previous mortgages, may not be rescinded.\");<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> <i>Mills v. EquiCredit Corp.,</i> 172 Fed.Appx. 652, 656 (6th Cir.2006) (approving of the district court's conclusion that \"assuming that the form used by EquiCredit was technically incorrect ... the form nonetheless informed Appellants of their right to cancel the loan transaction\") (unpublished opinion). Doral's disclosures were not perfect in this case, but they were sufficient to meet the statutory and regulatory requirements of the TILA and Regulation Z. <i>See Palmer,</i> 465 F.3d at 29 (\"[A]ny creditor who uses plain and legally sufficient language ought to be held harmless.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons given above, we <i>AFFIRM</i> the district court's dismissal of plaintiffs' claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> This factual disagreement is of potential import because the TILA rescission provisions do not apply to transactions \"which constitute[ ] a refinancing or consolidation (with no new advances) of the principal balance then due and any accrued and unpaid finance charges of an existing extension of credit by the same creditor secured by an interest in the same property.\" 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1635(e)(2). Doral alleges that the $1,300 remitted to the Santoses a month after the transaction was surplus escrow funds accumulated under the Santoses' original mortgage. However, because this case reaches us on a motion to dismiss, we presume that plaintiffs' allegation is correct: that the Santoses received a new money advance as part of their refinance<i>See Rogan,</i> 175 F.3d at 77.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> According to plaintiffs' complaint, Doral Mortgage is a wholly owned subsidiary of Doral Financial</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Because we accept as true plaintiffs' well-pleaded factual allegations, we cannot consider Doral's argument, which appears to have factual support in the record, that the Rojases obtained their original home loan from Southern Mortgage, rather than Doral. If true, the Rojases' transaction was not a same-lender refinancing, meaning that plaintiffs' central argument &#8212; that same-lender refinancing requires specialized disclosures &#8212; would not apply to the facts of the Rojases' transaction</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> In their complaint, plaintiffs purported to bring their claims on behalf of two classes of similarly situated consumers. However, the district court dismissed plaintiffs' claims in their entirety before the litigation reached the class certification stage. In any event, we have recently held that class certification is not available for rescission claims brought under the TILA<i>See McKenna v. First Horizon Home Loan Corp.,</i> 475 F.3d 418, 423 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> While the facts in this case do not require us to reach the issue, we have previously noted that there is statutory and case law support for the proposition that the model forms provide lenders a safe harbor protection whereby \"adherence to a model form bars a TILA non-disclosure claim entirely.\"<i>Palmer v. Champion Mortgage,</i> 465 F.3d 24, 29 n. 5 (1st Cir. 2006); <i>see also</i> 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1604(b) (\"The Board shall publish model disclosure forms and clauses for common transactions <i>to facilitate compliance</i> with the disclosure requirements of this subchapter ....\") (emphasis added).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> We do not follow the Seventh Circuit's view that \"TILA does not easily forgive `technical' errors.\"<i>Handy v. Anchor Mortgage Corp.,</i> 464 F.3d 760, 764 (7th Cir.2006) (quoting <i>Cowen v. Bank United of Texas,</i> 70 F.3d 937, 941 (7th Cir.1995)). As the Eleventh Circuit has explained, Congress in 1995 rejected this hyper-technical view of the TILA, by imposing a temporary moratorium on TILA class actions and then amending the statute out of concern that courts were \"allow[ing] plaintiffs to rescind a mortgage as a result of minor TILA violations.\" <i>Smith,</i> 108 F.3d at 1327 n. 4. In response to Congress's actions, most courts have adopted the clear and conspicuous standard in place of a rule of hyper-technicality. We believe this is the correct position, as we have recently stated. <i>See McKenna,</i> 475 F.3d at 424 (\"In taking this step, Congress made manifest that ... it had not intended that lenders would be made to face overwhelming liability for relatively minor violations.\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> In its 1996 commentary to the revised regulations, the FRB clarified that Model Form H-9 could be used for same-lender refinances where \"the original note and mortgage are extinguished and new documents are executed to cover both the outstanding debt and the amount borrowed in the new transaction.\" 61 Fed. Reg. 49,237-02 (1996). However, the FRB's statement that Model Form H-9<i>could</i> be used in such a transaction does not mean that use of that form is <i>required.</i> Indeed, because the TILA does not require lenders to use the model forms, the only test for compliance is whether the notice actually given informed the consumer clearly and conspicuously of his rights and obligations, consistent with Regulation Z.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Model Form H-9 explains, in part:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">If you cancel this new transaction, it will not affect any amount that you presently owe.

Neither is helpful to their cause. The first,<i>Handy v. Anchor Mortgage Corp.,</i> 464 F.3d 760 (7th Cir.2006), is not persuasive for two reasons. First, <i>Handy</i> adopts a hyper-technical compliance requirement, a position we have rejected. <i>See McKenna,</i> 475 F.3d at 424. Second, <i>Handy's</i> facts are quite different from those here. In <i>Handy,</i> the court concluded that the consumer was not clearly informed of her rescission rights where she received <i>both</i> Model Form H-8 and H-9, and her loan was an original transaction, rather than a refinance. 464 F.3d at 764. Plaintiffs also cite our recent decision in <i>Palmer,</i> 465 F.3d at 24. However, our conclusion here is consistent with <i>Palmer,</i> which held that we review the adequacy of a lender's notice under the standard of objective reasonableness. <i>Id.</i> at 28 (\"[W]e, like other courts, have focused the lens of our inquiry on the text of the disclosures themselves rather than on plaintiffs' descriptions of their subjective understandings.\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Plaintiffs assert that<i>Veale</i> is no longer good law because subsequent amendments and regulatory changes have overruled <i>Veale.</i> This argument is unpersuasive. Plaintiffs maintain that the 1995 congressional amendments to the TILA meant that \"a creditor's use of the wrong model disclosure form ... would not be protected.\" This is incorrect, for the simple reason that the TILA does not require use of the model forms at all. In addition, as noted earlier, <i>supra</i> n. 6, the 1995 amendments were intended to reduce, not increase, lender liability for minor violations.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

The first set, Johnny Santos-Rodriguez and Maria Betancourt-Castellanos (\"the Santoses\"), obtained an original home mortgage from Doral Mortgage in 1998. By March 2004, the Santoses had defaulted on 34 payments under the original loan. To maintain their home, they elected to refinance on March 13, 2004, again with Doral Mortgage. The new loan totaled $78,750, of which $72,883.45 was used to pay off the principal and finance charges due under the original loan, thus canceling that loan. The parties dispute what was done with the $5,866.55 in additional proceeds from the refinancing. Doral argues that the entire amount was remitted to Doral as financing charges, while the Santoses claim that one month after the transaction was finalized, they received $1,300 in proceeds from Doral.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Within a year, Doral Mortgage assigned the Santoses' new loan to Doral Financial,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> which was the legal holder of the note at the time this action was brought.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second set of plaintiffs is composed of Lymary Rojas-Morales and Ranfi Velez-Roman (\"the Rojases\"). The Rojases obtained an original home mortgage with Doral Mortgage.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> On August 27, 2003, the Rojases refinanced their original loan, again with Doral Mortgage. The refinancing loan totaled $104,500, of which $94,035.83 went to pay the principal balance and finance charges outstanding on the Rojases' original loan, which was cancelled. Of the remaining funds, $6,251.76 went to Doral Mortgage for refinancing fees, and $4,212.41 reverted to the Rojases as a new money advance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before closing on the refinancing loans, Doral provided the Santoses and Rojases with a Notice of Right to Cancel. The form was modeled on Federal Reserve Board Model Form H-8. <i>See</i> 12 C.F.R. &#167; 226.23 (app. H-8). Both sets of plaintiffs received identical disclosure forms, and they acknowledged receipt by signing the documents. Below, we excerpt the relevant sections of the disclosure form that plaintiffs received:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You are entering into a transaction that will result in a mortgage, lien or security interest on your home.

This three-day rescission period begins to run when the transaction is consummated or upon delivery of notice of the consumer's right to rescind, whichever occurs later. <i>Id.</i> However, the three-day rescission period is extended to three years if the lender fails to meet the disclosure requirements of the TILA. 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1635(f). The Federal Reserve Board (FRB) has issued an implementing regulation known as Regulation Z, which governs, among other things, the disclosures that lenders must make to consumers. 12 C.F.R. &#167; 226.1 <i>et seq.</i> Regulation Z includes an appendix of model forms for various consumer transactions, including Model Forms H-8 and H-9, which are at issue here. <i>See</i> 12 C.F.R. &#167; 226.23 (app. H-8, H-9).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 2005, plaintiffs informed Doral of their intention to rescind their refinance loans, arguing that Doral's alleged failure to disclose properly their rescission rights had extended the rescission period to three years. Thereafter, Doral issued written rejections of plaintiffs' attempts to rescind. In response, plaintiffs brought suit against Doral, originally framed as a class action,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, seeking rescission of their loans, and statutory and actual damages. The district court granted Doral's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, holding that Doral met its disclosure obligations by clearly and conspicuously informing the plaintiffs of their rescission rights. Plaintiffs now appeal the dismissal of their claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review <i>de novo</i> the grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, \"accepting all well-pleaded facts as true and giving the party who has pleaded the contested claim the benefit of all reasonable inferences.\" <i>Palmer v. Champion Mortgage,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202442\"><a href=\"/opinion/202442/palmer-v-champion-mortgage/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 27 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs make two arguments to support their assertion that the rescission period for their refinance transactions should be extended from three days to three years. First, they allege that Doral failed to comply with the TILA's disclosure requirements because it gave plaintiffs a form patterned on Model Form H-8, which is designed for general transactions, rather than one patterned on Model Form H-9, which is designed for same-lender refinancing transactions. <i>See</i> 61 Fed. Reg. 49,237-02 (1996). Second, plaintiffs argue that the form Doral used was misleading because it did not adequately explain the effects of rescinding a same-lender refinancing loan, as opposed to an original loan. We take these arguments in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' first approach is a non-starter. They insist, despite clear statutory and regulatory language to the contrary, that \"if the creditor does not provide the `appropriate form,' the borrower `shall have' rescission rights.\" This is simply incorrect. The statute permits the lender to inform consumers of their rescission rights by using \"the appropriate form of written notice published and adopted by the [Federal Reserve] Board, <i>or a comparable written notice</i> of the rights of the obligor.\" 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1635(h) (emphasis added). The plain meaning of the word \"or\" makes clear that the lender may comply with its disclosure obligations by using a model form or, alternatively, a comparable written notice. Regulation Z is equally clear that either type of notice will satisfy the lender's obligation: \"To satisfy the disclosure requirement ... the creditor shall provide the appropriate model form in Appendix H of this part <i>or a substantially similar notice.</i>\" 12 C.F.R. &#167; 226.23(b)(2) (emphasis added). In addition, the TILA plainly states that use of the model forms is not obligatory. <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1604(b) (\"Nothing in this subchapter may be construed to require a creditor or lessor to use any such model form or clause prescribed by the Board under this section.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, because the plain language of the statute and regulations does not require exclusive use of the model forms, plaintiffs are incorrect to insist that Doral's alleged failure to provide the appropriate FRB form is a per se violation of 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1635 and Regulation Z.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' second argument requires more analysis. They assert that Doral's use of a form patterned on Model Form H-8 rather than H-9 significantly misled them as to their rescission rights, because the effects of rescinding a same-lender refinance loan are different from the effects of rescinding an original loan. In particular, plaintiffs highlight that the form they received failed to disclose that if a same-lender refinancing loan is rescinded, the original loan is not cancelled, meaning that the lender retains a security interest in the property under the original loan, and the consumer reverts to paying off the original loan. Plaintiffs argue that a consumer would be less willing to rescind a same-lender refinance loan if he believed that as a result he would also have to repay the original mortgage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our analysis of this argument must start with the disclosure standard set forth in the TILA, which requires that lenders \"clearly and conspicuously disclose\" borrowers' rescission rights. 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1635(a).

The fourth element, requiring disclosure of the effects of rescission, is further explained at 12 C.F.R. &#167; 226.23(d), which delineates several effects of rescission that must be disclosed to the consumer, including:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) When a consumer rescinds a transaction, the security interest giving rise to the right of rescission becomes void and the consumer shall not be liable for any amount, including any finance charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) Within 20 calendar days after receipt of a notice of rescission, the creditor shall return any money or property that has been given to anyone in connection with the transaction and shall take any action necessary to reflect the termination of the security interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) If the creditor has delivered any money or property, the consumer may retain possession until the creditor has met its obligation under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

Rather, it describes a balance between competing considerations of complete disclosure ... and the need to avoid ... [information overload].\") (internal quotation and citation omitted) (emphasis in original). As this court has recently said, the 1995 TILA amendments, <i>see</i> Truth in Lending Act Amendments of 1995, Pub. L. No. 104-29, 109 Stat. 271, 272-73, were intended by Congress to \"provide higher tolerance levels for what it viewed as honest mistakes in carrying out disclosure obligations.\" <i>McKenna,</i> 475 F.3d at 424.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the key question in this case is whether Doral clearly and conspicuously informed plaintiffs of their right of rescission and the effects thereof, in compliance with the requirements laid out in Regulation Z. We conclude that Doral met its disclosure obligations. The form plaintiffs received explained, among other things, that (1) they were entering a transaction that would result in a mortgage on their home; (2) they had a legal right to rescind \"this transaction,\" without cost, within three days; and (3) if they were to rescind the transaction, the mortgage that would have been created by the refinancing transaction would also be cancelled. Because the form clearly stated that rescission was available only as to \"this transaction,\" Doral clearly and conspicuously informed plaintiffs that any rescission would only operate as to the current refinancing transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the form that plaintiffs received satisfied 12 C.F.R. &#167; 226.23(d), which details the effects of rescission that must be disclosed. Most importantly, Doral's disclosure form informed plaintiffs that, \"If you cancel the transaction, the mortgage, lien or security interest is also cancelled.\" This statement fulfilled the regulatory requirement that the lender disclose that, upon rescission of the current transaction \"the security interest giving rise to the right of rescission becomes void.\" 12 C.F.R. &#167; 226.23(d)(1). Contrary to plaintiffs' assertion, this disclosure is accurate even in same-lender refinance transactions such as those at issue here, because rescission of a refinance transaction does indeed cancel the entire security interest contemplated by the refinance agreement. In addition, rescission of the refinance transaction does not impact the lender's security interest under the original loan, which is held in abeyance until the rescission period has expired. <i>See</i> 12 C.F.R. &#167; 226.23(c) (\"Unless a consumer waives the right of rescission ... no money shall be disbursed other than in escrow, no services shall be performed and no materials delivered until the rescission period has expired and the creditor is reasonably satisfied that the consumer has not rescinded.\"). Here, because Doral's disclosure correctly stated that rescission of the refinance loan would cancel the security interest contemplated by that loan, and would impact only the refinance transaction, it satisfactorily disclosed the effects of rescission as required by 12 C.F.R. &#167; 226.23(d).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That said, it is true that the disclosure statement plaintiffs received did not affirmatively inform them, as the H-9 form would have, that rescission of the refinance transaction would not also rescind their original mortgage.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> However, we do not require perfect disclosure. The question before us is not whether the notification in Form H-9 would have been more complete than the notification plaintiffs actually received, but only whether the notification plaintiffs actually received met the requirements of the clear and conspicuous standard laid out in Regulation Z. Evaluating, as we must, Doral's disclosure from the vantage point of the hypothetical average consumer, <i>see Palmer,</i> 465 F.3d at 28, we conclude that because plaintiffs were told, clearly and conspicuously, that rescission would only operate as to their pending refinance transaction, any conclusions that they might have drawn from that disclosure about their previously existing mortgages were unreasonable (and, thus, not a valid basis for any TILA claim).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> <i>See Gambardella v.

Two other circuits (albeit only one in a published opinion) have reached this same conclusion, where Model Form H-8, or a form patterned on it, was used for a same-lender refinancing transaction. <i>See Veale,</i> 85 F.3d at 580 (\"We hold that ... the H-8 form provides sufficient notice that the current transaction may be canceled but that previous transactions, including previous mortgages, may not be rescinded.\");<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> <i>Mills v.

Doral's disclosures were not perfect in this case, but they were sufficient to meet the statutory and regulatory requirements of the TILA and Regulation Z. <i>See Palmer,</i> 465 F.3d at 29 (\"[A]ny creditor who uses plain and legally sufficient language ought to be held harmless.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons given above, we <i>AFFIRM</i> the district court's dismissal of plaintiffs' claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> This factual disagreement is of potential import because the TILA rescission provisions do not apply to transactions \"which constitute[ ] a refinancing or consolidation (with no new advances) of the principal balance then due and any accrued and unpaid finance charges of an existing extension of credit by the same creditor secured by an interest in the same property.\" 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1635(e)(2). Doral alleges that the $1,300 remitted to the Santoses a month after the transaction was surplus escrow funds accumulated under the Santoses' original mortgage. However, because this case reaches us on a motion to dismiss, we presume that plaintiffs' allegation is correct: that the Santoses received a new money advance as part of their refinance<i>See Rogan,</i> 175 F.3d at 77.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> According to plaintiffs' complaint, Doral Mortgage is a wholly owned subsidiary of Doral Financial</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Because we accept as true plaintiffs' well-pleaded factual allegations, we cannot consider Doral's argument, which appears to have factual support in the record, that the Rojases obtained their original home loan from Southern Mortgage, rather than Doral. If true, the Rojases' transaction was not a same-lender refinancing, meaning that plaintiffs' central argument &#8212; that same-lender refinancing requires specialized disclosures &#8212; would not apply to the facts of the Rojases' transaction</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> In their complaint, plaintiffs purported to bring their claims on behalf of two classes of similarly situated consumers. However, the district court dismissed plaintiffs' claims in their entirety before the litigation reached the class certification stage.

As the Eleventh Circuit has explained, Congress in 1995 rejected this hyper-technical view of the TILA, by imposing a temporary moratorium on TILA class actions and then amending the statute out of concern that courts were \"allow[ing] plaintiffs to rescind a mortgage as a result of minor TILA violations.\" <i>Smith,</i> 108 F.3d at 1327 n. 4. In response to Congress's actions, most courts have adopted the clear and conspicuous standard in place of a rule of hyper-technicality. We believe this is the correct position, as we have recently stated. <i>See McKenna,</i> 475 F.3d at 424 (\"In taking this step, Congress made manifest that ... it had not intended that lenders would be made to face overwhelming liability for relatively minor violations.\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> In its 1996 commentary to the revised regulations, the FRB clarified that Model Form H-9 could be used for same-lender refinances where \"the original note and mortgage are extinguished and new documents are executed to cover both the outstanding debt and the amount borrowed in the new transaction.\" 61 Fed. Reg. 49,237-02 (1996). However, the FRB's statement that Model Form H-9<i>could</i> be used in such a transaction does not mean that use of that form is <i>required.</i> Indeed, because the TILA does not require lenders to use the model forms, the only test for compliance is whether the notice actually given informed the consumer clearly and conspicuously of his rights and obligations, consistent with Regulation Z.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Model Form H-9 explains, in part:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">If you cancel this new transaction, it will not affect any amount that you presently owe.

First, <i>Handy</i> adopts a hyper-technical compliance requirement, a position we have rejected. <i>See McKenna,</i> 475 F.3d at 424. Second, <i>Handy's</i> facts are quite different from those here. In <i>Handy,</i> the court concluded that the consumer was not clearly informed of her rescission rights where she received <i>both</i> Model Form H-8 and H-9, and her loan was an original transaction, rather than a refinance. 464 F.3d at 764. Plaintiffs also cite our recent decision in <i>Palmer,</i> 465 F.3d at 24. However, our conclusion here is consistent with <i>Palmer,</i> which held that we review the adequacy of a lender's notice under the standard of objective reasonableness. <i>Id.</i> at 28 (\"[W]e, like other courts, have focused the lens of our inquiry on the text of the disclosures themselves rather than on plaintiffs' descriptions of their subjective understandings.\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Plaintiffs assert that<i>Veale</i> is no longer good law because subsequent amendments and regulatory changes have overruled <i>Veale.</i> This argument is unpersuasive. Plaintiffs maintain that the 1995 congressional amendments to the TILA meant that \"a creditor's use of the wrong model disclosure form ... would not be protected.\" This is incorrect, for the simple reason that the TILA does not require use of the model forms at all. In addition, as noted earlier, <i>supra</i> n. 6, the 1995 amendments were intended to reduce, not increase, lender liability for minor violations.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
