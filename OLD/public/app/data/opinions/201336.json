CHEAL,\n\n                     Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n          [The Hon. Rya W. Zobel, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                    Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                 Gibson, Senior Circuit Judge*,\n                   and Lipez, Circuit Judge,\n\n\n\n     William A. Gilmore, Jr., for appellant.\n     Diane C. Freniere, with whom Michael      J.   Sullivan,   U.S.\nAttorney, was on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n                       November 15, 2004\n\n\n____________________\n     *\n       Hon. John R. Gibson, of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by\ndesignation.\n\f     LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.    The defendant-appellant in this case,\n\nNancy J. Cheal, pleaded guilty to five counts of mail fraud (18\n\nU.S.C. § 1341) and two counts of wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343),\n\nafter being charged with bilking investors out of more than $2\n\nmillion in an \"international bank trading\" scheme.    The District\n\nCourt then sentenced Cheal to a term of imprisonment of 87 months,\n\nwith three years of supervised release to follow.     The District\n\nCourt also ordered Cheal to pay restitution in the amount of $2.1\n\nmillion.\n\n     Cheal now raises four issues on appeal: (1) the compliance of\n\nher change-of-plea hearing with the requirements of Rule 11 of the\n\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure; (2) the evidentiary basis for\n\nthe court's enhancement for obstruction of justice; (3) the court's\n\nfailure to grant a downward departure on the basis of her alleged\n\nreduced mental capacity; (4) the timeliness of the court's entry of\n\na restitution order.\n\n     Cheal's argument about the timing of her restitution order\n\nraises an issue of first impression in this circuit.       Congress\n\npassed the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996, Pub. L. No.\n\n104-132, 110 Stat. 1227 (codified as amended in scattered sections\n\nof 18 U.S.C.), to provide full restitution to identifiable victims\n\nof certain crimes, including mail and wire fraud, regardless of a\n\ndefendant's ability to pay.    One provision of that act, 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3664(d)(5), directs that \"the court shall set a date for the\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\ffinal determination of the victim's losses, not to exceed 90 days\n\nafter sentencing.\" Cheal argues that the restitution order in this\n\ncase, which was entered 127 days after sentencing, was invalid. As\n\nwe explain below, any error that the district court may have\n\ncommitted by entering Cheal's restitution order after the 90-day\n\nperiod did not constitute plain error. We therefore affirm Cheal's\n\nconvictions and sentence in their entirety.\n\n\n\n                                 I.\n\n     We take the facts from the presentence report (\"PSR\"), the\n\ntranscript of the plea hearing, and the district court’s findings.\n\nSee United States v. Voccola, 99 F.3d 37, 43 (1st Cir. 1996).1\n\n     At the time of her criminal conduct, Nancy Cheal was 60 years\n\nold and lived in a five-bedroom double-wide trailer home along with\n\nher second husband and four great-grandchildren.          She describes\n\nherself as the pastor to a small, nondenominational church in her\n\nhometown of Bunnell, Florida.\n\n     Beginning   approximately   eight   years   before   the   criminal\n\nconduct at issue in this case, Cheal ran a business out of her home\n\ncalled Relief Enterprise, Inc.         Cheal claimed to run several\n\n\n\n     1\n      Cheal objected generally to the PSR’s description of the\nfacts, but she offered no specifics to counter that description.\n\"[I]f the defendant’s objections are merely rhetorical and\nunsupported by countervailing proof, the district court is entitled\nto rely on the facts in the PSR.\" United States v. Cyr, 337 F.3d\n96, 100 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n                                 -3-\n\fprivate clubs somehow connected to Relief Enterprise with such\n\nnames    as   the   \"Get   America   Out   of   Debt   Private   Club,\"   the\n\n\"Fatherless Children Private Club,\" and the \"Senior Citizens’\n\nPrivate Club.\"      Although the purpose served by these clubs is not\n\nclear, they seemed to be perpetually short of the funds that Cheal\n\nsolicited on their behalf.\n\n        In October 1999, Cheal organized and began to advertise the\n\ninvestment scheme that led to her criminal convictions.2           Its basic\n\nnature was simple fraud: by falsely asserting that she was an\n\nexperienced trader in international securities and had the help of\n\nanother experienced trader, Cheal induced thousands of investors to\n\nsend her money in the hopes of an astronomical return on their\n\ninvestment.     She told investors that the scheme paid 100% of the\n\ninitial investment per week for twelve weeks.\n\n        Cheal was vague about the mechanism behind these remarkable\n\nnumbers, referring only to \"overseas trading\" of some kind and the\n\nservices of a renowned trader of international securities, one of\n\nonly seven people in the world licensed to trade in a certain\n\n(unspecified) kind of investment. She also claimed to have trading\n\nexperience herself. Cheal insisted that investors’ money would not\n\nitself be used for the trades; instead, she would place it in a\n\n\"safekeeping, non-depletion\" account, which meant that it would not\n\n\n     2\n      In addition to this criminal case, her conduct is the subject\nof a pending civil case brought by the Securities and Exchange\nCommission, titled S.E.C. v. Cheal, Civ. No. 00-10182-EFH.\n\n                                     -4-\n\fbe risked in the deal.\n\n      Cheal also laced the scheme with religious and charitable\n\nelements, sometimes claiming that Relief Enterprise had bought a\n\nbank in Oklahoma, which, because it was on an \"Indian Reservation,\"\n\nwould not be subject to the usual federal regulations and could\n\ntherefore offer mortgages at extremely low rates to help poor\n\npeople buy homes.   At other times, Cheal claimed that the purpose\n\nof the enterprise was to raise money to build a church.       Although\n\nthe   precise   charitable   purposes    varied,   Cheal   consistently\n\nmaintained that she wanted to benefit the public and \"help the\n\nlittle guy.\"\n\n      Along with other employees of Relief Enterprise working at her\n\ndirection, Cheal disseminated her investment offer through faxes,\n\ne-mails, letters, and telephone calls.       A referral fee of 1 to 5%\n\nalso provided an incentive for people to spread the word.         As a\n\nresult of these efforts, Relief Enterprise managed to raise more\n\nthan $2 million in a few months.\n\n      Not surprisingly, Relief Enterprise did not make its promised\n\npayments.    Originally, the first payouts were to come in late\n\nOctober or early November 1999.         As those dates came and went,\n\nCheal offered excuses for the delay, ranging from a death in the\n\ntrader’s family to the Y2K computer bug.      Then Cheal's scheme came\n\nto the attention of law enforcement.\n\n      On October 27, 1999, a disgruntled investor contacted the U.S.\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fSecret Service with complaints about Relief Enterprise. Because of\n\nthe use of the mails to carry out the scheme, the Secret Service\n\npassed the complaints on to the U.S. Postal Service.           On October\n\n28, a postal inspector, Louis Keith, met Cheal at a convenience\n\nstore     near    her   home   for   an   interview.   Cheal   signed   two\n\ndeclarations stating that she \"initially had a solicitation to\n\nobtain loans to build a church\" and that others had modified this\n\nsolicitation without her knowledge or consent.           Estimating that\n\nRelief Enterprise had so far collected between three and four\n\nthousand dollars, she said that she would refund the money by\n\nNovember 1 that had been sent to her by wire transfer and would\n\nreturn to the inspector all funds received in letters and packages.\n\nFinally, she promised \"to cease receiving letters and packages\n\nrelating to this solicitation and return them to the sender,\" and\n\nshe authorized the Postal Service to intercept and return any\n\nfuture packages on her behalf.\n\n        On November 8, 1999, Cheal met again with Inspector Keith and\n\ngave him a box containing 1,296 checks totaling approximately\n\n$171,000.3       At this meeting, Inspector Keith confronted Cheal with\n\nevidence that she had made the 1200% (100% per week over twelve\n\nweeks) offer herself to at least one investor.          She admitted that\n\nshe had and that she \"may\" have made the offer to others.\n\n\n\n     3\n       Later that month, the Postal Service returned these checks\nto their senders.\n\n                                      -6-\n\f      Cheal, however, was deceiving Inspector Keith at this meeting.\n\nRather    than   returning     to    him    all   of    the   funds   that    Relief\n\nEnterprise had so far collected, she had in fact instructed her\n\nemployees to segregate investments into those worth less than $400\n\nand   those   worth   more.         The    smaller     investments    she    gave   to\n\nInspector Keith; the larger investments, equaling at that point at\n\nleast $1.3 million, she kept.\n\n      Subsequently, Cheal contacted the senders of the smaller\n\ninvestments to explain her legal difficulties and to ask them to\n\nsend their money again by a private courier such as Federal Express\n\nor UPS.    In some cases, one of Cheal's employees even explained\n\nthat she had given the postal inspector only checks for less than\n\n$400 and had kept the rest and asked the investors to keep this\n\ninformation a secret.4        Cheal continued soliciting new investments\n\nas well.\n\n      Cheal used the proceeds from her investment scheme in a\n\nvariety of ways.      She paid off more than $100,000 in personal debt,\n\ngave $110,000 to a friend, gave bonuses to her attorney and\n\nemployees, and made numerous purchases, including a minivan, a new\n\ntrailer home for $67,000, and a big-screen TV.                 At one point, she\n\ntried to buy a $400,000 home with cash but was turned down.\n\n      On February 28, 2001, a grand jury sitting in the U.S.\n\n\n      4\n      To one investor, for example, a Relief Enterprise employee\nwrote: \"The Postal Inspector requested we send ALL pkgs received\nback. We sent back all under $400. (Don't tell him!)\"\n\n                                          -7-\n\fDistrict Court for the District of Massachusetts returned an\n\nindictment charging Cheal with defrauding others of more than $2.1\n\nmillion.   The indictment listed five counts of mail fraud under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1341 and two counts of wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343.\n\nCheal was arrested on March 2, 2001, in the Middle District of\n\nFlorida and released on bond.        On March 13, 2001, Cheal appeared\n\nfor arraignment before the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts,\n\nwhich appointed counsel for her.\n\n     On September 6, 2001, the District Court ordered a psychiatric\n\nevaluation of Cheal. On January 8, 2002, after psychiatrists hired\n\nby the government and the defense had both advised that Cheal was\n\ncompetent to stand trial, the District Court agreed and the case\n\nmoved forward.\n\n     On October 15, 2002, the first day of trial, Cheal pleaded\n\nguilty to all seven counts against her, and the court held a\n\nchange-of-plea hearing as required by Rule 11 of the Federal Rules\n\nof Criminal Procedure.      The Probation Office then prepared a PSR\n\nrecommending   a   total   offense    level   of     31   under   the   federal\n\nsentencing guidelines: a base offense level of 6, plus 13 because\n\nthe total cost of the scheme to victims was more than $2.5 million,\n\nplus 2 for more-than-minimal planning, plus 2 because the crimes\n\ninvolved   mass-marketing,    plus    2    because    Cheal   misrepresented\n\nherself as acting on behalf of a charitable or religious agency.\n\nIn addition, the PSR determined that Cheal should receive a four-\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\flevel upward adjustment for her leadership role and a two-level\n\nupward adjustment for willful obstruction of justice.            The PSR\n\nrecommended   that   she   receive   no   credit   for    acceptance   of\n\nresponsibility.\n\n     At the sentencing hearing on February 20, 2003, Cheal objected\n\nto the upward adjustment for willful obstruction and asked for a\n\ndownward departure based on diminished mental capacity.                The\n\ndistrict court    ultimately   accepted   the   PSR’s    recommendations,\n\nexcept that it did grant a two-level downward adjustment for\n\nacceptance of responsibility.    It also ordered restitution.       Cheal\n\nfiled a timely notice of appeal on March 4, 2003.5\n\n                                  II.\n\n     Appellants who claim relief because of an allegedly flawed\n\nchange-of-plea hearing face a high hurdle when they have not first\n\nraised their objections in the court below.        See United States v.\n\nPagan-Ortega, 372 F.3d 22, 27 (1st Cir. 2004).          In such cases, we\n\n\n     5\n       Cheal also filed three motions around this time, all of\nwhich were denied. On March 24, 2003, Cheal filed a motion with\nthis Court asking that we stay her incarceration pending appeal.\nOn March 27, 2003, we denied that motion without prejudice because\nshe had not sought such relief in the court below and had not shown\nthat she met the requirements of 18 U.S.C. § 3143(b)(1) (appellant\nshall be detained unless not likely to flee or pose a danger to the\ncommunity, and appeal is not for purpose of delay and raises a\nsubstantial question of law or fact).     On April 1, 2003, Cheal\nfiled a motion to stay with the district court, which the court\ndenied the next day on the grounds that Cheal had not filed a\nmotion for relief from judgment of conviction. On April 3, 2003,\nCheal filed a motion with the district court for relief from\njudgment of conviction, which the court denied the same day without\ncomment.\n\n                                 -9-\n\freview only for plain error.       United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725,\n\n733-34 (1993); see Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b).             After this case was\n\nbriefed and argued, the Supreme Court decided United States v.\n\nDominguez Benitez, __ U.S. __, 124 S. Ct. 2333, 159 L. Ed. 2d. 157\n\n(2004), which further refined the standard for granting relief\n\nbased on a Rule 11 error that had not been preserved below.              The\n\nCourt held that\n\n      a defendant who seeks reversal of his conviction after a\n      guilty plea, on the ground that the district court\n      committed plain error under Rule 11, must show a\n      reasonable probability that, but for the error, he would\n      not have entered the plea. A defendant must thus satisfy\n      the judgment of the reviewing court, informed by the\n      entire record, that the probability of a different result\n      is sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of\n      the proceeding.\n\n124   S.   Ct.   at   2340   (citations    and   internal   quotation   marks\n\nomitted).    We apply this standard here.        Of course, if there was no\n\nerror at all, we never reach the issue of the probability of a\n\ndifferent result.\n\n                  A. Validity of Cheal’s Plea Colloquy\n\n      Cheal first contends that she consistently asserted her legal\n\ninnocence throughout the hearing, never fully agreeing to the\n\ngovernment's allegations and case against her, and that the court\n\ntherefore lacked a sufficient factual basis to accept her plea.\n\nSecond, Cheal claims that the court's failure to conduct the\n\nchange-of-plea hearing in accordance with Rule 11 meant that she\n\ndid not enter her plea intelligently, knowingly, and voluntarily.\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fAlthough Cheal’s behavior during the plea colloquy was erratic, her\n\nadmissions, when combined with the government's evidence, provided\n\na sufficient basis for the plea, and the court’s procedure complied\n\nas a whole with Rule 11.6     There was no error in the conduct of the\n\nchange-of-plea hearing.\n\n\n            1.   The Factual Basis for Cheal's Plea of Guilty\n\n      Rule 11 requires that\n\n      there be an admission, colloquy, proffer, or some other\n      basis for thinking that the defendant is at least\n      arguably guilty. . . .\n           . . . .\n      On a plea, the question under Rule 11(f) is not whether\n      a jury would, or even would be likely, to convict: it is\n      whether there is enough evidence so that the plea has a\n      rational basis in facts that the defendant concedes or\n      that the government proffers as supported by credible\n      evidence.\n\nUnited States v. Gandia-Maysonet, 227 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\nCheal pleaded guilty to mail and wire fraud.                To prove these\n\ncrimes, the government must show three elements: (1) a scheme to\n\ndefraud based on false pretenses; (2) the defendant's knowing and\n\nwilling participation in the scheme with the intent to defraud; and\n\n(3)   the    use   of   interstate    mail   or   wire   communications   in\n\nfurtherance of that scheme.          United States v. Martin, 228 F.3d 1,\n\n\n\n      6\n      In our review, we consider the version of Rule 11 that was in\neffect at the time of Cheal's change-of-plea hearing. See United\nStates v. Mercado, 349 F.3d 708, 709-10 (2d Cir. 2003), cert.\ndenied, __ U.S. __, 124 S. Ct. 1190, 157 L. Ed. 2d 1220 (2004). An\namended version became effective on December 1, 2002, after Cheal\npleaded guilty.\n\n                                      -11-\n\f15 (1st Cir. 2000).     \"The factual predicate for the requisite mens\n\nrea may be inferred from all the evidence alluded to at the Rule 11\n\nhearing.\"    United States v. Marrero-Rivera, 124 F.3d 342, 352 (1st\n\nCir. 1997); see also United States v. Japa, 994 F.2d 899, 903-04\n\n(1st Cir. 1993).\n\n     It is true that Cheal made a number of statements throughout\n\nthe change-of-plea hearing contesting the government’s version of\n\nthe facts against her.     After the government's initial recitation\n\nof facts, for example, Cheal responded: \"I agree with ten percent\n\nof what he said, about ten percent of it is correct.\"              She then\n\ndelivered a rambling narrative of her own version of the facts,\n\nwhich included several denials that she was running or even knew\n\nabout the investment scheme promising a 1200% return over twelve\n\nweeks.      Cheal claimed that she had simply solicited loans to\n\npurchase a bank that would help fund low-cost mortgages, and that\n\nher employees     had   modified   this   plan   without   her   consent   or\n\nknowledge.     At first, Cheal claimed she had never sent faxes to\n\nanyone.     Then, when the court asked why she had a fax machine in\n\nher home, she said she had sometimes faxed back \"a prayer request,\"\n\nand then that she had responded to people \"after they had been\n\npromised a hundred percent return.\"\n\n     Cheal also read a prepared statement in which she admitted\n\nthat she misrepresented herself as being an experienced securities\n\ntrader, that she \"recklessly mismanaged the loan proceeds received\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\ffor Relief Enterprise from lenders,\" that \"in setting up these\n\nprograms I made reckless decisions and judgments,\" and that she\n\n     recklessly allowed persons in my office . . . to\n     misrepresent the facts and nature of my loan program to\n     prospective lenders which resulted in persons sending\n     loan [sic] and money and applications to me with false\n     information about the program. . . . Among the false\n     statements provided to such lenders was that: (1) lenders\n     could expect 100 percent of the loan value return from\n     each one of their loans for twelve weeks . . .; and (2)\n     that all lenders’ moneys were to be kept in a secured\n     lenders’ account. So, to all these charges I do plead\n     guilty.\n\nIn a subsequent exchange with Cheal, the court tried to determine\n\nwhether   Cheal   was   admitting   to   having   made   the     1200%\n\nmisrepresentation herself, or whether she was admitting only to\n\nfailing to correct her employees' misrepresentations, which she had\n\noverheard:\n\n          THE COURT: So you acknowledge that people on your\n     behalf were making these statements --\n          THE DEFENDANT: Yes, your honor.\n          THE COURT: -- but you did not correct them?\n          THE DEFENDANT: Yes -- well, I corrected them when I\n     was aware of it, but I did not correct them when I found\n     out afterwards.    I couldn't do anything about it, I\n     thought.    The attorney since advised me there was\n     something legally I could have done.\n\n     The government then submitted for the court’s consideration a\n\nnumber of documents and faxes, which Cheal admitted were all in her\n\nhandwriting, and recorded telephone conversations, in which Cheal\n\nadmitted participating.    This evidence showed conclusively that\n\nCheal herself had represented that the scheme would return 100% per\n\nweek for twelve weeks, that she was an experienced securities\n\n\n                               -13-\n\ftrader, that she had secured the services of another experienced\n\ntrader, and that the lenders’ money would be kept in a safe,\n\nnondepletion account and would not itself be risked in the trades.\n\n     This proffer of evidence, when combined with Cheal’s own\n\nstatements to the court, satisfied Rule 11's requirement of a\n\nfactual basis for a plea of guilty, even if Cheal never admitted\n\nexplicitly to a \"knowing and willing participation\" in the scheme,\n\nMartin, 228 F.3d at 15.   On the basis of what it described as \"her\n\nstatements to the court, on the tapes that she acknowledges are in\n\nher voice, [and] the letters and statements that are in her hand\n\nand/or signed by her,\" the district court was free to infer that\n\nCheal had the requisite mens rea, Marrero-Rivera, 124 F.3d at 352,\n\nand that the plea otherwise had a rational basis in fact.7\n\n     Cheal's argument is fundamentally flawed because it assumes\n\nthat the district court could rely only on her admissions in court\n\nto find a sufficient factual basis to accept her plea.   As Gandia-\n\nMaysonet and our other cases make clear, the court may find such a\n\nbasis either in the defendant's admissions or from the government's\n\n\n\n     7\n       Cheal's admissions also supported a plea of guilty on a\ntheory of willful blindness, permitting a defendant to be charged\nwith knowledge of a fact if she deliberately closed her eyes to\nsomething that otherwise would have been obvious to her.       See\nUnited States v. Gabriele, 63 F.3d 61, 66-67 (1st Cir. 1995). As\nthe court put it: \"Now, to the extent that the defendant doesn't\nadmit every detail of the government's evidence, she does admit\nwithout question that she was reckless as to the consequences of\nwhat she and people on her behalf did do in making representations\nand in obtaining money from others.\"\n\n                               -14-\n\fpresentation.          In    this   case,      not    only       did   Cheal    admit   to\n\nsubstantial wrongdoing, including acknowledging repeatedly that she\n\nmade numerous \"reckless\" decisions with investors' money, but the\n\ngovernment also made extensive proffers of evidence -- faxes in\n\nCheal's handwriting and telephone calls in her voice -- that it\n\nintended    to   use    at    trial.      Given       the    wealth     of   information\n\navailable to the court from these two sources, it did not err in\n\nfinding a sufficient factual basis to accept Cheal's plea of\n\nguilty.\n\n\n 2.   Cheal's Understanding of the Nature of the Charges and the\n                     Consequences of Her Plea\n\n\n      Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure ensures\n\nthat a defendant who pleads guilty does so with an \"understanding\n\nof the nature of the charge and the consequences of his plea.\"\n\nMcCarthy v. United States, 394 U.S. 459, 467 (1969).                         Cheal argues\n\nrepetitiously that her insistent denials at the change-of-plea\n\nhearing show that she could not have understood the charges against\n\nher or the consequences of her plea.                 We have already rejected this\n\nargument's premise -- that Cheal did not admit to enough facts to\n\nallow the court to accept her guilty plea.                       Moreover, her factual\n\ndisagreements, arguably skirting the edges of culpability, reveal\n\nthe extent to which she fully understood the charges against her\n\nand the consequences of her plea.\n\n      In   further     support      of   her   claim        of   confusion     about    the\n\n                                         -15-\n\fconsequences of her plea, Cheal notes that, at one point in the\n\nhearing, she denied that she had told investors that their money\n\nwould not be risked in the trades, and she said that a business\n\nassociate of hers \"would come here and testify to this if it goes\n\nto the jury. . . .    I was using my own money to trade.\"    Cheal\n\ncontends that this reference to a possible trial \"clearly shows the\n\nconfusion she had regarding the purpose of the plea hearing.    At\n\nthe same time that Ms. Cheal is asserting her innocence, she is\n\nstating that she has witnesses who would testify at trial.   Based\n\non these statements alone an obvious confusion exists.\"\n\n     We disagree. In assessing Cheal’s claim of confusion, we must\n\nreview the totality of the Rule 11 hearing.\n\n     What is critical is the substance of what was\n     communicated by the trial court, and what should\n     reasonably have been understood by the defendant, rather\n     than the form of the communication. At a minimum, Rule\n     11 requires that the trial court address the defendant\n     personally in open court to ascertain that his plea is\n     voluntary and intelligent.\n\nUnited States v. Cotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1995)\n\n(citations omitted). We find that this minimum requirement was met\n\nhere when, later in the hearing, the court explicitly asked Cheal\n\nif she understood that, with a guilty plea, she was giving up her\n\nright to a jury trial and her right to call witnesses on her\n\nbehalf.   To those questions, Cheal answered yes.\n\n     Cheal also complains that, after the government's proffer, the\n\ncourt did not immediately follow up by asking her whether she\n\n\n                               -16-\n\fagreed with the evidence presented.            Instead, the court launched\n\ninto a series of questions asking Cheal whether she understood the\n\nmaximum   penalties    under   the     mail    and   wire   fraud   laws,   the\n\nsentencing guidelines, her right to trial, her right to counsel,\n\nand the other usual inquiries.          \"Thus,\" Cheal says, \"despite the\n\n[court's]    being    cognizant   of     the    Appellant's    assertion     of\n\ninnocence, [it] makes no further inquiry of the Appellant regarding\n\nan acknowledgment of guilt nor does the [court] ascertain through\n\nfurther inquiry whether the Appellant's plea was knowing, voluntary\n\nand intelligent.\"      Yet the colloquy cited by Cheal, required by\n\nRule 11 and routine in change-of-plea hearings, is designed to\n\nconfirm a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent plea.                 In Cheal's\n\ncase, the colloquy did just that. Cheal's responses to the court's\n\nquestions asking whether she understood the proceedings were almost\n\nalways in the affirmative.           When she        said that she did not\n\nunderstand    her    right   against     self-incrimination,        the   court\n\nexplained that right to her until Cheal said she did understand it.\n\nCheal's insistence on that explanation confirms that she was not\n\nmerely giving mindless answers to the court's other questions.8\n\n\n\n     8\n       Cheal also overlooks the fact that, when the government had\nfinished its presentation, the court actually asked defense\ncounsel's permission to move on, saying, \"Now may I continue with\nmy questioning of the defendant?\" Cheal's counsel responded, \"You\nmay, your Honor.\" Rule 11 does not require the court to follow a\nprecise sequence of questions, and, in any event, by that point in\nthe hearing, Cheal evidently had had plenty of time to express her\ndisagreement with the government's version of the facts.\n\n                                     -17-\n\fThere was no error in the court's conduct of the change-of-plea\n\nhearing and its eventual acceptance of her guilty plea.\n\n\nB. Sentencing Adjustment Based on Obstruction of Justice\n\n     Cheal   challenges   the   two-level   upward   adjustment   to   her\n\nsentence under USSG § 3C1.1 for obstruction of justice, arguing\n\nthat the court made no \"suitable findings\" at the sentencing\n\nhearing to support the adjustment.9      This argument has no merit.\n\n     As usual, we review a district court’s legal interpretation of\n\nthe guideline de novo and review the court's fact-finding for clear\n\nerror, giving due deference to the court's application of the\n\nguidelines to the facts.     United States v. Mitchell, 85 F.3d 800,\n\n813 (1st Cir. 1996).     USSG § 3C1.1 provides for a two-level upward\n\nadjustment where the defendant \"willfully obstructed or impeded, or\n\nattempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice\n\nduring the course of the investigation . . . of the instant offense\n\nof conviction . . . .\"    The adjustment's commentary advises that it\n\napplies to, among other kinds of conduct, a defendant who has given\n\na \"materially false statement to a law enforcement officer that\n\nsignificantly obstructed or impeded the official investigation or\n\nprosecution of the instant offense.\"        USSG § 3C1.1, cmt. n.4.     At\n\n\n     9\n      All references to the United States Sentencing Guidelines are\nto the November 2002 version in effect at the time of Cheal's\nsentencing. See United States v. Harotunian, 920 F.2d 1040, 1041-\n42 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"Barring any ex post facto problem, a defendant\nis to be punished according to the guidelines in effect at the time\nof sentencing.\").\n\n                                  -18-\n\fCheal's sentencing hearing, the district court stated that the\n\nadjustment was \"primarily based on Ms. Cheal's conduct with the\n\npostal inspector, Keith.       She did not follow his orders, the money\n\nwas not returned, and the scheme continued at least for a period of\n\ntime after that.    It seems to me that does amount to obstruction of\n\njustice.\"\n\n      Cheal argues that we should set this adjustment aside because\n\nthe district court failed to take direct testimony on this point\n\nand   failed   to   make   a    specific   finding    that   her   actions\n\n\"significantly\" obstructed the investigation, in the commentary's\n\nwords.   In support of this argument, she repeats her claim here,\n\nmade to the district court as well, that the postal inspector never\n\ngave her a copy of the laws she was violating and never told her\n\nthat the laws prohibited her from receiving monies through private\n\ncouriers like Federal Express as well as through the U.S. mail.\n\n      In fact, the district court did address these points at the\n\nhearing and quickly rejected them, saying simply: \"I understand\n\nthat, and that objection is overruled.\"              No more was needed,\n\nespecially when the court had already adopted the whole of the\n\nPSR’s factual findings, which thoroughly cover the details of\n\nCheal's meetings with the postal inspector (and do not support her\n\nversion of the encounters advanced in her brief).            The district\n\ncourt committed no error by imposing the adjustment for obstruction\n\n\n\n\n                                   -19-\n\fof justice in the way it did.10\n\nC. Denial of Downward Departure Based on Diminished Mental Capacity\n\n      Cheal argues that the district court erred by failing to hold\n\na hearing on whether she was entitled to a downward departure based\n\non   diminished    mental   capacity.11      The   decision   to   hold   an\n\nevidentiary hearing during the sentencing phase is within the\n\ndiscretion of the district court.         United States v. Robles-Torres,\n\n109 F.3d 83, 85 (1st Cir. 1997).           Consequently, if the district\n\ncourt had denied a request from Cheal for such a hearing, we would\n\nreview for abuse of discretion.\n\n      In this case, however, Cheal did not even make such a request.\n\n\"It is . . . clear that, at a bare minimum, he who expects to\n\nreceive a discretionary dispensation must first seek it. Thus, the\n\nfailure to ask the district court to convene an evidentiary hearing\n\nordinarily spells defeat for a contention that one should have been\n\nheld.\"     United States v. Tardiff, 969 F.2d 1283, 1286 (1st Cir.\n\n1992).     That is so because our review under these circumstances is\n\nfor plain error only.\n\n\n      10\n       The Supreme Court decided Blakely v. Washington, ___ U.S.\n___, 124 S. Ct. 2531, 159 L. Ed. 2d 403 (2004), after oral argument\nin this case. Cheal has not submitted a letter of supplemental\nauthority under Fed. R. App. P. 28(j) challenging her sentence\nbased on Blakely's possible application to the federal sentencing\nguidelines. Consequently, we do not address the issue.\n      11\n       USSG § 5K2.13 provides that a \"sentence below the applicable\nguideline range may be warranted if the defendant committed the\noffense while suffering from a significantly reduced mental\ncapacity.\"\n\n                                   -20-\n\f     Although Cheal registered no such objection at the sentencing\n\nhearing, she now contends that the court erred in its description\n\nof the evaluations from the psychiatrists for the government and\n\nthe defense.   At the sentencing hearing, the court said that the\n\nreports \"agree that she's not entitled to a finding of diminished\n\ncapacity.\"   In fact, the defense psychiatrist's evaluation stated\n\nthat, while Cheal was competent to stand trial, \"it is my opinion\n\nthat she would meet the statutory criteria of the United States\n\nsentencing guidelines for diminished capacity.\"      He added that\n\nCheal \"did . . . have a significantly reduced mental capacity.\"12\n\n     At the same time, however, the evaluation of the defense\n\npsychiatrist contained observations suggesting that Cheal possessed\n\na normal mental capacity, at least at the time of the evaluation.\n\nIt noted that she did not \"appear to have any disorganization in\n\nher thought flow, nor does she suffer from any hallucinations. Her\n\nintellectual faculties appear to be intact with no cognitive\n\ndeficits or decrease in her intellectual ability.\" Ultimately, the\n\npsychiatrist concluded that \"she knew that what she was doing was\n\nwrong, but did not fully appreciate the wrongfulness of her conduct\n\n\n\n     12\n         The psychiatrist added that Cheal appeared to hold some\nbizarre ideas about the United States government. She believed\nthat there are dozens of lawyers working behind the scenes in the\nWhite House to bring the United States back to \"constitutional law\"\ninstead of the current \"judicial law.\" These lawyers intend to\nabolish the Internal Revenue Service in favor of a consumption tax\nand have already secretly converted one-third of the country's\nbanks to \"treasury banks\" backed by the gold standard.\n\n                               -21-\n\fbecause, in her psychotic state, [she] believed that what she was\n\ndoing was proper and moral.\"\n\n     Although the district court erred when it stated that both\n\npsychiatrists had the same opinion as to Cheal's entitlement to a\n\ndeparture based     on    mental   capacity   (they    did    not),     the   more\n\ncritical   consideration     for     plain-error    review    is    whether    the\n\nreports were so divergent that the court could not reasonably rely\n\non them to reject Cheal's claim of diminished mental capacity\n\nwithout holding an evidentiary hearing.            They were not.      The court\n\ncommitted no plain error when it stated, on the evidence before it,\n\nthat \"I do not believe that any of the grounds advanced by the\n\ndefendant are sufficient for a departure.\"\n\n                          D. The Restitution Order\n\n     Cheal’s last claim of error on the timing of her restitution\n\norder presents an issue of first impression for us.                As part of the\n\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA),\n\nCongress passed the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (MVRA),\n\nwhich, as its title suggests, made restitution mandatory for the\n\nvictims    of   certain    crimes,    including     mail     and    wire   fraud,\n\nregardless of the defendant's ability to pay.13              See 18 U.S.C. §§\n\n\n     13\n      Restitution for such crimes is not mandatory only where the\nnumber of victims is so large and the issues of fact so complex\n\"that the need to provide restitution to any victim is outweighed\nby the burden on the sentencing process.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3).\nWhile the number of victims here gave the government considerable\ntrouble in compiling a full, accurate list of losses, Cheal has not\nsuggested that this provision applies here.\n\n                                      -22-\n\f3663A and 3664.     Section 3664, titled \"Procedure for issuance and\n\nenforcement of order of restitution,\" provides:\n\n     If the victim’s losses are not ascertainable by the date\n     that is 10 days prior to sentencing, the attorney for the\n     Government or the probation officer shall so inform the\n     court, and the court shall set a date for the final\n     determination of the victim’s losses, not to exceed 90\n     days after sentencing.       If a victim subsequently\n     discovers further losses, the victim shall have 60 days\n     after discovery of those losses in which to petition the\n     court for an amended restitution order. Such order may\n     be granted only upon a showing of good cause for the\n     failure to include such losses in the initial claim for\n     restitutionary relief.\n\nId. § 3664(d)(5).\n\n     At Cheal’s sentencing hearing on February 20, 2003, the\n\ngovernment asked the district court to order restitution, estimated\n\nat around $2.5 million, but requested an additional 90 days under\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3664 to provide a final list of victims and amounts\n\nowed.   The court informed Cheal of its ruling on this request:\n\n     You shall pay restitution. There will be a restitution\n     order. I cannot now designate the amount nor the payees.\n     And under 18 U.S.C. 3664(d)(5), I will grant a 90-day\n     period for the U.S. Attorney’s office to come to a number\n     and share with Mr. Murray [trial counsel for the defense]\n     so that we can have hopefully an agreed amount.\n\nOn February 25, 2003, the court entered judgment in the case,\n\nstating:   \"The   determination   of   restitution   is   deferred   until\n\n5/25/03.   An amended judgment in a criminal case will be entered\n\nafter such a determination.\" On May 21, 2003, the government filed\n\na memorandum with the court identifying 2,350 individual victims\n\nand the amounts owed them, which totaled just under $2.1 million.\n\n\n                                  -23-\n\fOn the same day, it served this memorandum on Cheal’s trial\n\ncounsel, Robert Murray.\n\n     In the prior three months, however, with the approval of this\n\nCourt, Cheal had changed attorneys.          On March 4, 2003, Cheal had\n\nfiled her notice of appeal.    On April 4, 2003, Cheal filed a pro se\n\nmotion requesting us to appoint an attorney \"to handle my appeal,\n\nmy stay, and whatever else is necessary at this time.\"          On the same\n\nday, we ordered that \"new appellate counsel shall be appointed.\"\n\nOn April 10, 2003, we appointed Cheal’s current appellate counsel,\n\nallowed   trial   counsel   (Murray)    to    \"withdraw   as   counsel   for\n\nappellant,\" and ordered Murray to forward the case record to\n\nappellate counsel by April 24, 2003.         It appears that the district\n\ncourt was not advised of this change in Cheal's counsel.\n\n     Finally, on June 27, 2003, the district court issued an\n\nAmended Judgment and Order requiring Cheal to make restitution in\n\nthe amounts and to the victims specified in the government's list.\n\nThis order noted: \"No opposition to these numbers and amounts has\n\nbeen filed.\"\n\n     Cheal makes three arguments based on this history. First, the\n\ndistrict court did not enter its order for restitution until June\n\n27, 2003 -- 127 days after the February 20, 2003 sentencing\n\nhearing, rather than within the required 90 days.          Cheal contends\n\n\n\n\n                                 -24-\n\fthat this delay rendered the order invalid.14   Second, Cheal claims\n\n\n     14\n      18 U.S.C. § 3664(d)(5) uses two phrases whose precise\nmeanings have not been explored by this Court. First, § 3664(d)(5)\nrefers to a \"final determination of the victim’s losses\" but not\nspecifically to the initial order for restitution. Other courts to\nconsider this point have found that \"final determination\" in this\ncontext must mean the initial order itself. \"[T]he provision that\na victim may 'petition the court for an amended restitution order'\nwould have no meaning unless the order had been entered.\" United\nStates v. Stevens, 211 F.3d 1, 4 (2d Cir. 2000). See also United\nStates v. Jolivette, 257 F.3d 581, 584 (6th Cir. 2001); United\nStates v. Maung, 267 F.3d 1113, 1121 (11th Cir. 2001); United\nStates v. Grimes, 173 F.3d 634, 639-40 (7th Cir. 1999). We agree\nwith these courts, although we note that, elsewhere, § 3664 does\ndistinguish between the determination and the order. See §§ 3664\n(f)(1)(A) (\"In each order of restitution, the court shall order\nrestitution to each victim in the full amount of each victim's\nlosses as determined by the court . . . .\") and 3664(f)(2) (\"Upon\ndetermination of the amount of restitution owed to each victim, the\ncourt shall . . . specify in the restitution order the manner in\nwhich, and the schedule according to which, the restitution is to\nbe paid . . . .\").\n     Second, § 3664(d)(5) keys its time periods to \"sentencing\" --\n\"10 days prior to sentencing,\" \"90 days after sentencing\" -- but\ndoes not specify whether this term refers to the sentencing hearing\nor to the district court's actual entry of judgment. We conclude\nthat \"sentencing\" in this provision refers to the sentencing\nhearing for four reasons.      First, we read this provision in\nconjunction with § 3664(d)(1), which requires the government to\nprovide the probation officer with a listing of the amounts subject\nto restitution \"not later than 60 days prior to the date initially\nset for sentencing.\" It makes more sense to speak of the district\ncourt setting a date for the sentencing hearing, rather than for\nentry of judgment, which is not usually done on some preset date.\nSecond, because of the usual uncertainty about precisely when a\ndistrict court plans to enter judgment, it would be difficult to\ncalculate the date that would fall \"10 days prior to sentencing\" as\nprovided by § 3664(d)(5) (which provides that \"[i]f the victim's\nlosses are not ascertainable by the date that is 10 days prior to\nsentencing, the attorney for the Government or the probation\nofficer shall so inform the court.\") Third, our interpretation is\nmore consistent with the language of Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(i), titled\n\"Sentencing,\" which begins: \"At sentencing,\" and goes on to refer\nto the sentencing hearing. Fourth, keying this 10-day deadline to\nthe sentencing hearing gives better expression to a Congressional\nintent to allow the defendant to develop objections to the\n\n                               -25-\n\fthat she was not given notice of, and hence had no opportunity to\n\nobject to, the government’s victims’ loss list because the list was\n\nsent to her old trial counsel instead of her new appellate counsel.\n\nThird, the court should have considered her ability to pay in\n\ncalculating the amount of restitution owed.\n\n     We review restitution orders for abuse of discretion and their\n\nsubsidiary findings of fact for clear error.              United States v.\n\nCutter, 313 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2002).                  If the appellant’s\n\nchallenge is based on a legal conclusion, we review that conclusion\n\nde novo.   Id. at 6.       Where the defendant has failed to object\n\nbelow, however, we review only for plain error.              United States v.\n\nTheodore, 354 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2003).            Under this standard,\n\nCheal must show \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or\n\nobvious and which not only (3) affected [her] substantial rights,\n\nbut also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public\n\nreputation of the judicial proceedings.\"         United States v. Duarte,\n\n246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir. 2001).             After considering Cheal's\n\narguments, we affirm the restitution order in its entirety.\n\n               1. The Timing of the Restitution Order\n\n     Although the government concedes that the order was not\n\nentered within 90 days of sentencing, it urges us to overlook this\n\nirregularity to further the statute's purpose of increasing the\n\n\n\ngovernment's   data   in   time   to   present   them   at    the   sentencing\nhearing.\n\n                                   -26-\n\flikelihood that victims of crime will receive restitution from the\n\ndefendant.      The government also argues that the court’s statements\n\nabout restitution at the change-of-plea and sentencing hearings and\n\nin the original judgment gave notice to Cheal that she would face\n\na restitution order after a delay of 90 days.                             Finally, the\n\ngovernment notes that Cheal has never objected to restitution,\n\neither at the sentencing hearing or after the original judgment,\n\nand even now has not identified any actual disagreement with the\n\norder.\n\n       Cheal had the opportunity to object to the district court's\n\nscheduling of a deferred restitution order but did not.                         When the\n\ncourt     entered      judgment       on     February    25,    2003,     it    deferred\n\ndetermination of restitution until May 25, 2003, and indicated that\n\nit    would    enter   an    amended       judgment     at   some   unspecified     time\n\nthereafter.      Even though it was now a virtual certainty that the\n\nrestitution order would be entered more than 90 days after her\n\nsentencing, Cheal did not object.                   By failing to object at the\n\ntime, Cheal subjected her appellate claim of error to plain-error\n\nreview.\n\n        Cheal cites no prejudice from the delay in entering the\n\nrestitution order.           Indeed, as the government points out, she does\n\nnot    claim    even   now     that    she    disagrees      with   the   government’s\n\naccounting      of     her     victims'       losses     and   the      court’s    final\n\ndetermination.          In    an   effort     to    avoid    the    prejudice     showing\n\n\n                                             -27-\n\frequired      by   plain    error,   Cheal       argues     that   §    3664   is    a\n\njurisdictional provision.         That is, by not entering a restitution\n\norder within 90 days after her sentencing hearing, Cheal argues,\n\nthe   district     court    no   longer    had    jurisdiction     to    enter      any\n\nrestitution order.         This jurisdictional argument is undermined by\n\n§ 3664's provision for continued revision of the restitution order\n\nin light of later discoveries of losses.              Indeed, the title of the\n\nprovision (“Procedure for issuance and enforcement of order of\n\nrestitution”) advertises its procedural nature, including the 90-\n\nday time frame.15\n\n      The     legislative    history      of   the   MVRA    reveals     Congress’s\n\n\n\n      15\n           See United States v. Vandeburg, 201 F.3d 805, 814 (6th Cir.\n2000):\n\n      Section 3664(d)(5) is not a jurisdictional statute. Were\n      we to read it as terminating a court's jurisdiction 90\n      days after a sentencing hearing, we would be effectively\n      nullifying its provision that a victim may petition the\n      court for an amended restitution order 60 days after the\n      discovery of any additional losses.    The MVRA permits\n      amendments to restitution orders to reflect changed\n      circumstances, and neither confers nor terminates a\n      court's jurisdiction.\n\n201 F.3d at 814 (citation omitted). A year later, however, United\nStates v. Jolivette, 257 F.3d 581 (6th Cir. 2001), came to a\ndifferent and seemingly irreconcilable conclusion: \"We believe that\n[the MVRA] makes clear the congressional intent to prohibit courts\nfrom making restitution determinations after the statutory period\nhas run. . . . [W]e hold that when the 90-day clock runs out, the\njudgment of conviction and sentence, including the restitution\nprovision, becomes final by operation of the statute.\" Jolivette,\n257 F.3d at 584. Strangely, Jolivette did not cite Vandeburg or\nrefer to it in any way.         As noted, we reject Jolivette’s\njurisdictional view of § 3664.\n\n                                       -28-\n\fdetermination to provide full restitution to victims of fraud if at\n\nall possible. The Senate Judiciary Committee, in its report on the\n\nbill that would become the MVRA, stated: \"It is essential that the\n\ncriminal justice system recognize the impact that crime has on the\n\nvictim, and, to the extent possible, ensure that [the] offender be\n\nheld accountable to repay these costs.\"           S. Rep. No. 104-179, at 18\n\n(1995), reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 924, 930.16                     Although the\n\nCommittee acknowledged the importance of \"the need for finality and\n\ncertainty in the sentencing process,\" it added that \"justice cannot\n\nbe considered served until full restitution is made.\"                   Id. at 20.17\n\nThe   Committee    did   not    relate   the    90-day      requirement      to   the\n\ninterests    of   defendants,       stating    that   the    \"sole     due   process\n\ninterest of the defendant being protected during the sentencing\n\nphase is the right not to be sentenced on the basis of invalid\n\npremises or inaccurate information.\"              Id.    See United States v.\n\nZakhary, 357 F.3d 186, 191 (2d Cir. 2004) (\"As this court has now\n\ntwice explained, the purpose behind the statutory ninety-day limit\n\non    the   determination      of   victims’    losses      is   not    to   protect\n\n\n       16\n        The conference managers of the final version of AEDPA\ndirected that S. Rep. 104-179 \"should serve as the legislative\nhistory for [the MVRA].\" H.R. Conf. Rep. 104-518, at 112 (1996),\nreprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 944, 945. At the time of S. Rep.\n104-179, the text that would become 18 U.S.C. § 3664(d)(5) was in\nsubstantially final form and included the 90-day period.\n       17\n       The committee also noted its desire \"that defendants not be\nable to fraudulently transfer assets that might be available for\nrestitution,\" id., although it did not tie this concern\nspecifically to the 90-day rule.\n\n                                       -29-\n\fdefendants from drawn-out sentencing proceedings or to establish\n\nfinality; rather, it is to protect crime victims from the willful\n\ndissipation of defendants’ assets.\"). The Seventh Circuit has also\n\nemphasized that the MVRA's \"intended beneficiaries are the victims,\n\nnot the victimizers.\"       United States v. Grimes, 173 F.3d 634, 639\n\n(7th Cir. 1999).\n\n     Cheal's timing argument would abrogate an obligation to pay\n\nmore than $2 million in restitution to thousands of defrauded\n\ninvestors.       On   the   facts   here,   such   an   outcome   would   be\n\nantithetical to the purpose of the MVRA.           Moreover, a finding of\n\nplain error in Cheal’s favor would turn the plain-error doctrine on\n\nits head by \"seriously impair[ing] the fairness, integrity, or\n\npublic reputation of the judicial proceedings.\"           Duarte, 246 F.3d\n\nat 60.      See Johnson v. United States, 520 U.S. 461, 470 (1997)\n\n(\"Indeed, it would be the reversal of a conviction such as this\n\nwhich would have that effect.\")         We will not countenance such a\n\nresult.18\n\n\n     18\n        It is also important to understand the difficult\ncircumstances confronting the district court and the government in\na case such as this. In truth, § 3664's one-size-fits-all 90-day\ndeadline seems poorly suited for complex cases involving thousands\nof victims and millions of dollars in losses.     Other courts of\nappeals have offered advice on how to comply with § 3664’s time\nlimits and still render a complete and accurate accounting of the\ndefendant’s misconduct.   The Eleventh Circuit, for example, has\nsuggested that if district courts foresee a problem with getting\nthe restitution order entered within 90 days of sentencing, they\n\"can postpone sentencing and thereby put off the start of the 90-\nday period.\" United States v. Maung, 267 F.3d 1113, 1121 (11th\nCir. 2001). We note this suggestion without expressing an opinion\n\n                                    -30-\n\f                 2.   Notice to Cheal’s Trial Counsel\n\n     As noted, the court entered judgment in this case on February\n\n25, 2003.   Cheal filed her notice of appeal from that judgment on\n\nMarch 4, 2003.   On April 4, she filed a pro se motion in this Court\n\nfor new counsel.      We issued an order on April 10, 2003, allowing\n\nher trial counsel to withdraw and appointing new appellate counsel,\n\neven though Cheal's restitution order was still pending in the\n\ndistrict court and she continued to need the services of her trial\n\ncounsel. Although Cheal's motion asked for counsel to be appointed\n\nfor her appeal and \"for whatever else is necessary at this time,\"\n\nour order requiring trial counsel to forward the case record to new\n\nappellate   counsel    by   April   24   implies   that   we   thought   the\n\nproceedings in the district court were finished.\n\n     Meanwhile, both the district court and the government seemed\n\nunaware of the change in counsel that we had approved.            When the\n\ngovernment finished preparing its memorandum identifying Cheal's\n\nvictims and their losses, it sent the memo to Cheal's trial\n\ncounsel, whom we had allowed to withdraw a month and a half before.\n\nWhen the district court entered an amended judgment a month after\n\nreceiving the government's memo, it also listed Cheal's trial\n\ncounsel on its order and wrote that \"[n]o opposition to these\n\nnumbers and amount has been filed.\"\n\n     Cheal argues that she filed no opposition because the failure\n\n\non it.\n\n                                    -31-\n\fof coordination between the district court and our court on the\n\nimportant matter of which attorney represented her meant that her\n\nattorney never received notice of the pending restitution order.\n\nRegrettably, it appears that there was uncertainty among everyone\n\ninvolved -- former trial counsel, new appellate counsel, the\n\ngovernment, and the district and appellate courts -- over the\n\nquestion of Cheal's legal representation in the still incomplete\n\nrestitution proceedings.        This uncertainty lends force to Cheal's\n\nclaim    that   she   never   received   proper   notice   of   the   pending\n\nrestitution order. The absence of such notice is a serious matter.\n\nHowever, even after the five-and-a-half months between the court's\n\nentry of its restitution order and the filing of Cheal's brief on\n\nappeal (from June 27 to December 12, 2003), Cheal's brief does not\n\ncontain even a bare-bones assertion that she disputes anything in\n\nthe restitution order.        She merely asserts that she is entitled to\n\nan evidentiary hearing because she did not get one before.\n\n        Cheal's due process claim cannot succeed without at least some\n\nshowing of the challenge she would mount to the restitution order.\n\nSee United States v. Luciano-Mosquera, 63 F.3d 1142, 1158 (1st Cir.\n\n1995) (\"[t]he defendant must show prejudice\" to prove that his\n\nright to due process was violated when a court reporter's failure\n\nto provide transcripts delayed processing of his appeal); see also\n\nUnited States v. Lovasco, 431 U.S. 783, 790 (1977) (\"[P]roof of\n\nprejudice is generally a necessary but not sufficient element of a\n\n\n                                    -32-\n\fdue process claim . . . .\")             Cheal has not made even a minimal\n\nshowing of the challenge to restitution that she would make at an\n\nevidentiary   hearing.      Under       these   circumstances,   despite   the\n\nregrettable problems with notice of the proposed restitution order,\n\nwe must reject her due process claim.\n\n     However, we must add an explanatory note about future cases,\n\nlike this one, involving deferred restitution orders at the time\n\nthat a defendant files a notice of appeal from the entry of\n\njudgment.     There might be a question whether the judgment of\n\nconviction entered on February 25, 2003, which imposed Cheal's\n\nsentence but only ordered restitution in general terms, was a final\n\njudgment    that   triggered      the    running   of   the   appeal   period.\n\nArguably, the judgment was not truly final until June 27, 2003,\n\nwhen the district court issued an Amended Judgment and Order\n\nrequiring Cheal to make restitution in the amounts and to the\n\nvictims    specified   in   the    government's     list.      Despite   these\n\nplausible arguments, we must treat the February judgment as final\n\nand appealable because of a statutory provision in the MVRA.\n\n     18 U.S.C. § 3664(o) provides: \"A sentence that imposes an\n\norder of restitution is a final judgment notwithstanding the fact\n\nthat such a sentence can subsequently be corrected . . .; appealed\n\nand modified . . .; amended under subsection (d)(5); or adjusted .\n\n. . .\"    As we have already mentioned, subsection (d)(5) addresses\n\nitself to two situations that may require changes to a restitution\n\n\n                                        -33-\n\forder.     First, where the victim's losses cannot be determined\n\nbefore sentencing, it provides an extra 90 days for a \"final\n\ndetermination.\" Second, where the \"final determination\" has failed\n\nto account for some victims who did not discover their losses until\n\nlater, subsection (d)(5) provides such victims \"60 days after\n\ndiscovery of those losses in which to petition the court for an\n\namended restitution order.\"          18 U.S.C. § 3664(d)(5).            Section\n\n3664(o)'s instruction, then, to disregard for purposes of finality\n\nrestitution orders \"amended under subsection (d)(5)\" could be read\n\nnarrowly       as   encompassing   only    the   second    situation,     which\n\nspecifically provides for \"an amended restitution order.\"\n\n     However, we decline to read § 3664(o) so narrowly.                      The\n\nprovision states that courts should treat a \"sentence that imposes\n\nan order of restitution\" as final, notwithstanding the possibility\n\nof subsequent modification. In Cheal's case, the February judgment\n\nimposed    a    restitution   obligation.        The   court   stated   in   the\n\njudgment: \"The defendant shall pay the balance of the restitution\n\naccording to a court-ordered repayment schedule.\"                Although the\n\nspecific amounts of restitution and the list of victims were yet to\n\nbe determined, an \"order of restitution\" (the phrase used in §\n\n3664(o)) had been entered.           Sensibly and properly, the court\n\nadvised Cheal of her right to appeal from the sentence that it had\n\njust imposed: \"You are advised, Ms. Cheal, that you have the right\n\n[to] appeal from the sentence by filing a notice of appeal.               I ask\n\n\n                                    -34-\n\fMr. Murray to talk with you about this and file such a notice\n\nwithin ten days if you decide to appeal.\"\n\n      A contrary rule -- one that linked the finality of the\n\njudgment of conviction to a later restitution order that included\n\nspecific amounts and victims -- would have troubling consequences\n\nfor defendants, who have an obvious and legitimate interest in\n\npursuing a timely appeal.       This interest would be compromised if\n\nthe   judgment   of   conviction    were   not   final   until    the    final\n\nrestitution determination was reflected in an order of the court.\n\nIndeed, a defendant could already be incarcerated without the\n\nability to pursue an appeal until the specifics of restitution are\n\nlater determined.      For these reasons of statutory language and\n\npolicy, we   conclude    that   the   February   judgment   was    one   that\n\n\"impose[d] an order of restitution\" on Cheal within the meaning of\n\n§ 3664(o) and was final and appealable.19\n\n      However, this conclusion raises a question as to whether\n\nCheal's notice of appeal from the February judgment, filed pro se\n\non March 4, 2003, served to bring before us the Amended Judgment\n\nand Order of June 27, 2003, which specified the restitution amounts\n\nowed to identified victims.        Fed. R. App. P. 3(c)(1)(B) provides\n\nthat the notice of appeal must \"designate the judgment, order, or\n\n\n      19\n        United States v. Kapelushnik, 306 F.3d 1090 (11th Cir.\n2002), by contrast, takes the opposite view that a notice of appeal\nis premature if filed before final determination of restitution.\nId. at 1093-94. We also disagree with that court's interpretation\nof § 3664's 90-day period as jurisdictional. See id.\n\n                                   -35-\n\fpart thereof being appealed.\"           The defendant must file the notice\n\nof appeal within ten days after the entry of judgment or the order\n\nbeing appealed.          See Fed. R. App. P. 4(b).      Typically, these rules\n\nprevent a court of appeals from considering any orders or judgments\n\nbesides those designated in the appellant's notice of appeal.                  In\n\nthe    case   of    an    amended   judgment   or   a   later   order   that   is\n\nsubstantively different, an appellant may have to amend his notice\n\nof appeal or file a new one.           \"The settled rule is that the non-\n\nsubstantive revision of a previously entered judgment does not\n\nrestart or otherwise affect the period within which appellate\n\nreview must be sought.         It is only when the judgment-issuing court\n\nalters matters of substance or resolves some genuine ambiguity that\n\nthe entry of an amended judgment winds the appeals clock anew.\"\n\nAir Line Pilots Ass'n v. Precision Valley Aviation, Inc., 26 F.3d\n\n220,    223   n.2   (1st     Cir.   1994)   (internal   citations   omitted).20\n\nCheal's March 4 notice of appeal stated in full: \"Notice is hereby\n\n\n       20\n       The same rule applies in criminal cases. See United States\nv. Rapoport, 159 F.3d 1, 3 n.4 (1st Cir. 1998). The guide in such\nsituations remains Federal Trade Commission v. Minneapolis-\nHoneywell Regulator Co., 344 U.S. 206 (1952), which cautioned that\n\n       the mere fact that a judgment previously entered has been\n       reentered or revised in an immaterial way does not toll\n       the time within which review must be sought. Only when\n       the lower court changes matters of substance, or resolves\n       a genuine ambiguity, in a judgment previously rendered\n       should the period within which an appeal must be taken or\n       a petition for certiorari filed begin to run anew. The\n       test is a practical one.\n\nId. at      211-212.\n\n                                       -36-\n\fgiven that Nancy Cheal in the above named case hereby appeals to\n\nthe United States Court of Appeals for the 6th [sic] Circuit from\n\na judgment and sentence entered in this action on the 20th [sic]\n\nday of February, 2003.\"21    Arguably, she should have filed a second\n\nnotice of appeal from the Amended Judgment and Order of restitution\n\nof June 27, 2003.    Indeed, looking to the future, we think that, as\n\na   general   proposition,   a   deferred   restitution    order   entered\n\npursuant to    §   3664(d)(5),   subsequent   to   a   final   judgment    of\n\nconviction which has already been appealed, should be the subject\n\nof a second notice of appeal.22\n\n      In this case, however, we consider the adequacy of Cheal's\n\nMarch 4 notice of appeal in light of general principles that\n\n\"encourage us to construe notices of appeal liberally and examine\n\nthem in the context of the record as a whole.\"         Chamorro v. Puerto\n\nRican Cars, Inc., 304 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2002); see also Blockel\n\nv. J.C. Penney Co., Inc., 337 F.3d 17, 23-4 (1st Cir. 2003).              The\n\ncore purpose of a notice of appeal is to \"facilitate a proper\n\ndecision on the merits.\"         Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182\n\n\n      21\n       Despite the reference to the Sixth Circuit, Cheal in fact\nsent her notice to the clerk of this Court, as well as the district\ncourt and counsel.\n      22\n      See, e.g., United States v. Ferrario-Pozzi, 368 F.3d 5, 7-8\n(1st Cir. 2004) (defendant filed first notice of appeal from entry\nof judgment and second from preliminary order of forfeiture); In re\nKeeper of Records (Grand Jury Subpoena Addressed to XYZ Corp.), 348\nF.3d 16, 19 (1st Cir. 2003) (corporation filed first notice of\nappeal from order to produce documents and second from citation of\ncontempt for failure to produce them).\n\n                                   -37-\n\f(1962).23   Cheal's notice of appeal was sufficiently clear in its\n\nintent to challenge all elements of her conviction and sentence,\n\nwhich, as we have noted, imposed a general restitution obligation.\n\nThere is also no question here of surprise or prejudice to the\n\ngovernment.    See United States v. Winn, 948 F.2d 145, 154-55 (5th\n\nCir. 1991) (treating a pre-judgment notice of appeal as effective,\n\nwhere the defendant's intent to appeal ruling was clear and the\n\ngovernment was not prejudiced or misled). Both sides fully briefed\n\nthe restitution issues on appeal. Therefore, on the facts here, we\n\nconclude that Cheal's notice of appeal filed on March 4, 2003,\n\nserved to bring the restitution order of June 27, 2003, before us\n\nfor appellate consideration.\n\n 3. Considering Cheal's Ability To Pay When Ordering Restitution\n\n      Cheal argues, citing United States v. Haddock, 50 F.3d 835\n\n(10th Cir. 1995), that the district court erred by not reviewing\n\nher   financial      resources     before     deciding    whether     to   order\n\nrestitution and in what amount.

Gilmore, Jr., for appellant.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Diane C. Freniere, with whom Michael J. Sullivan, U.S. Attorney, was on brief, for appellee.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge, GIBSON, Senior Circuit Judge<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s\" id=\"fn-s_ref\">*</a>, and LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant-appellant in this case, Nancy J. Cheal, pleaded guilty to five counts of mail fraud (18 U.S.C. &#167; 1341) and two counts of wire fraud (18 U.S.C. &#167; 1343), after being charged with bilking investors out of more than $2 million in an \"international bank trading\" scheme. The District Court then sentenced Cheal to a term of imprisonment of 87 months, with three years of supervised release to follow. The District Court also ordered Cheal to pay restitution in the amount of $2.1 million.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cheal now raises four issues on appeal: (1) the compliance of her change-of-plea hearing with the requirements of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure; (2) the evidentiary basis for the court's enhancement for obstruction of justice; (3) the court's failure to grant a downward departure on the basis of her alleged reduced mental capacity; (4) the timeliness of the court's entry of a restitution order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cheal's argument about the timing of her restitution order raises an issue of first impression in this circuit. Congress passed the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1227 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 18 U.S.C.), to provide full restitution to identifiable victims of certain crimes, including mail and wire fraud, regardless of a defendant's ability to pay. One provision of that act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3664(d)(5), directs that \"the court shall set a date for the final determination of the victim's losses, not to exceed 90 days after sentencing.\" Cheal argues that the restitution order in this case, which was entered 127 days after sentencing, was invalid. As we explain below, any error that the district court may have committed by entering Cheal's restitution order after the 90-day period did not constitute plain error. We therefore affirm Cheal's convictions and sentence in their entirety.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We take the facts from the presentence report (\"PSR\"), the transcript of the plea hearing, and the district court's findings. <i>See United States v. Voccola,</i> 99 F.3d 37, 43 (1st Cir.1996).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of her criminal conduct, Nancy Cheal was 60 years old and lived in a five-bedroom double-wide trailer home along with her second husband and four great-grandchildren. She describes herself as the pastor to a small, nondenominational church in her hometown of Bunnell, Florida.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beginning approximately eight years before the criminal conduct at issue in this case, Cheal ran a business out of her home called Relief Enterprise, Inc. Cheal claimed to run several private clubs somehow connected to Relief Enterprise with such names as the \"Get America Out of Debt Private Club,\" the \"Fatherless Children Private Club,\" and the \"Senior Citizens' Private Club.\" Although the purpose served by these clubs is not clear, they seemed to be perpetually short of the funds that Cheal solicited on their behalf.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1999, Cheal organized and began to advertise the investment scheme that led to her criminal convictions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Its basic nature was simple fraud: by falsely asserting that she was an experienced trader in international securities and had the help of another experienced trader, Cheal induced thousands of investors to send her money in the hopes of an astronomical return on their investment. She told investors that the scheme paid 100% of the initial investment per week for twelve weeks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cheal was vague about the mechanism behind these remarkable numbers, referring only to \"overseas trading\" of some kind and the services of a renowned trader of international securities, one of only seven people in the world licensed to trade in a certain (unspecified) kind of investment. She also claimed to have trading experience herself. Cheal insisted that investors' money would not itself be used for the trades; instead, she would place it in a \"safekeeping, non-depletion\" account, which meant that it would not be risked in the deal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cheal also laced the scheme with religious and charitable elements, sometimes claiming that Relief Enterprise had bought a bank in Oklahoma, which, because it was on an \"Indian Reservation,\" would not be subject to the usual federal regulations and could therefore offer mortgages at extremely low rates to help poor people buy homes. At other times, Cheal claimed that the purpose of the enterprise was to raise money to build a church. Although the precise charitable purposes varied, Cheal consistently maintained that she wanted to benefit the public and \"help the little guy.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Along with other employees of Relief Enterprise working at her direction, Cheal disseminated her investment offer through faxes, e-mails, letters, and telephone calls. A referral fee of 1 to 5% also provided an incentive for people to spread the word. As a result of these efforts, Relief Enterprise managed to raise more than $2 million in a few months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not surprisingly, Relief Enterprise did not make its promised payments. Originally, the first payouts were to come in late October or early November 1999. As those dates came and went, Cheal offered excuses for the delay, ranging from a death in the trader's family to the Y2K computer bug. Then Cheal's scheme came to the attention of law enforcement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 27, 1999, a disgruntled investor contacted the U.S. Secret Service with complaints about Relief Enterprise. Because of the use of the mails to carry out the scheme, the Secret Service passed the complaints on to the U.S. Postal Service. On October 28, a postal inspector, Louis Keith, met Cheal at a convenience store near her home for an interview. Cheal signed two declarations stating that she \"initially had a solicitation to obtain loans to build a church\" and that others had modified this solicitation without her knowledge or consent. Estimating that Relief Enterprise had so far collected between three and four thousand dollars, she said that she would refund the money by November 1 that had been sent to her by wire transfer and would return to the inspector all funds received in letters and packages. Finally, she promised \"to cease receiving letters and packages relating to this solicitation and return them to the sender,\" and she authorized the Postal Service to intercept and return any future packages on her behalf.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 8, 1999, Cheal met again with Inspector Keith and gave him a box containing 1,296 checks totaling approximately $171,000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> At this meeting, Inspector Keith confronted Cheal with evidence that she had made the 1200% (100% per week over twelve weeks) offer herself to at least one investor. She admitted that she had and that she \"may\" have made the offer to others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cheal, however, was deceiving Inspector Keith at this meeting. Rather than returning to him all of the funds that Relief Enterprise had so far collected, she had in fact instructed her employees to segregate investments into those worth less than $400 and those worth more. The smaller investments she gave to Inspector Keith; the larger investments, equaling at that point at least $1.3 million, she kept.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequently, Cheal contacted the senders of the smaller investments to explain her legal difficulties and to ask them to send their money again by a private courier such as Federal Express or UPS. In some cases, one of Cheal's employees even explained that she had given the postal inspector only checks for less than $400 and had kept the rest and asked the investors to keep this information a secret.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Cheal continued soliciting new investments as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cheal used the proceeds from her investment scheme in a variety of ways. She paid off more than $100,000 in personal debt, gave $110,000 to a friend, gave bonuses to her attorney and employees, and made numerous purchases, including a minivan, a new trailer home for $67,000, and a big-screen TV. At one point, she tried to buy a $400,000 home with cash but was turned down.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 28, 2001, a grand jury sitting in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts returned an indictment charging Cheal with defrauding others of more than $2.1 million. The indictment listed five counts of mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1341 and two counts of wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1343. Cheal was arrested on March 2, 2001, in the Middle District of Florida and released on bond. On March 13, 2001, Cheal appeared for arraignment before the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts, which appointed counsel for her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 6, 2001, the District Court ordered a psychiatric evaluation of Cheal. On January 8, 2002, after psychiatrists hired by the government and the defense had both advised that Cheal was competent to stand trial, the District Court agreed and the case moved forward.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 15, 2002, the first day of trial, Cheal pleaded guilty to all seven counts against her, and the court held a change-of-plea hearing as required by Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The Probation Office then prepared a PSR recommending a total offense level of 31 under the federal sentencing guidelines: a base offense level of 6, plus 13 because the total cost of the scheme to victims was more than $2.5 million, plus 2 for more-than-minimal planning, plus 2 because the crimes involved mass-marketing, plus 2 because Cheal misrepresented herself as acting on behalf of a charitable or religious agency. In addition, the PSR determined that Cheal should receive a four-level upward adjustment for her leadership role and a two-level upward adjustment for willful obstruction of justice. The PSR recommended that she receive no credit for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing on February 20, 2003, Cheal objected to the upward adjustment for willful obstruction and asked for a downward departure based on diminished mental capacity. The district court ultimately accepted the PSR's recommendations, except that it did grant a two-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. It also ordered restitution. Cheal filed a timely notice of appeal on March 4, 2003.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants who claim relief because of an allegedly flawed change-of-plea hearing face a high hurdle when they have not first raised their objections in the court below. <i>See United States v. Pagan-Ortega,</i> 372 F.3d 22, 27 (1st Cir.2004). In such cases, we review only for plain error. <i>United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 733-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <i>see</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b). After this case was briefed and argued, the Supreme Court decided <i>United States v. Dominguez Benitez,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004), which further refined the standard for granting relief based on a Rule 11 error that had not been preserved below. The Court held that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a defendant who seeks reversal of his conviction after a guilty plea, on the ground that the district court committed plain error under Rule 11, must show a reasonable probability that, but for the error, he would not have entered the plea. A defendant must thus satisfy the judgment of the reviewing court, informed by the entire record, that the probability of a different result is sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">124 S.Ct. at 2340 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). We apply this standard here. Of course, if there was no error at all, we never reach the issue of the probability of a different result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Validity of Cheal's Plea Colloquy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cheal first contends that she consistently asserted her legal innocence throughout the hearing, never fully agreeing to the government's allegations and case against her, and that the court therefore lacked a sufficient factual basis to accept her plea. Second, Cheal claims that the court's failure to conduct the change-of-plea hearing in accordance with Rule 11 meant that she did not enter her plea intelligently, knowingly, and voluntarily. Although Cheal's behavior during the plea colloquy was erratic, her admissions, when combined with the government's evidence, provided a sufficient basis for the plea, and the court's procedure complied as a whole with Rule 11.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> There was no error in the conduct of the change-of-plea hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">1. <i>The Factual Basis for Cheal's Plea of Guilty</i></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Rule 11 requires that</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">there be an admission, colloquy, proffer, or some other basis for thinking that the defendant is at least arguably guilty....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On a plea, the question under Rule 11(f) is not whether a jury would, or even would be likely, to convict: it is whether there is enough evidence so that the plea has a rational basis in facts that the defendant concedes or that the government proffers as supported by credible evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v. Gandia-Maysonet,</i> 227 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.2000). Cheal pleaded guilty to mail and wire fraud. To prove these crimes, the government must show three elements: (1) a scheme to defraud based on false pretenses; (2) the defendant's knowing and willing participation in the scheme with the intent to defraud; and (3) the use of interstate mail or wire communications in furtherance of that scheme. <i>United States v. Martin,</i> 228 F.3d 1, 15 (1st Cir.2000). \"The factual predicate for the requisite <i>mens rea</i> may be inferred from all the evidence alluded to at the Rule 11 hearing.\" <i>United States v. Marrero-Rivera,</i> 124 F.3d 342, 352 (1st Cir. 1997); <i>see also United States v. Japa,</i> 994 F.2d 899, 903-04 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that Cheal made a number of statements throughout the change-of-plea hearing contesting the government's version of the facts against her. After the government's initial recitation of facts, for example, Cheal responded: \"I agree with ten percent of what he said, about ten percent of it is correct.\" She then delivered a rambling narrative of her own version of the facts, which included several denials that she was running or even knew about the investment scheme promising a 1200% return over twelve weeks. Cheal claimed that she had simply solicited loans to purchase a bank that would help fund low-cost mortgages, and that her employees had modified this plan without her consent or knowledge. At first, Cheal claimed she had never sent faxes to anyone. Then, when the court asked why she had a fax machine in her home, she said she had sometimes faxed back \"a prayer request,\" and then that she had responded to people \"after they had been promised a hundred percent return.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cheal also read a prepared statement in which she admitted that she misrepresented herself as being an experienced securities trader, that she \"recklessly mismanaged the loan proceeds received for Relief Enterprise from lenders,\" that \"in setting up these programs I made reckless decisions and judgments,\" and that she</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">recklessly allowed persons in my office ... to misrepresent the facts and nature of my loan program to prospective lenders which resulted in persons sending loan [sic] and money and applications to me with false information about the program.... Among the false statements provided to such lenders was that: (1) lenders could expect 100 percent of the loan value return from each one of their loans for twelve weeks ...; and (2) that all lenders' moneys were to be kept in a secured lenders' account. So, to all these charges I do plead guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a subsequent exchange with Cheal, the court tried to determine whether Cheal was admitting to having made the 1200% misrepresentation herself, or whether she was admitting only to failing to correct her employees' misrepresentations, which she had overheard:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT: So you acknowledge that people on your behalf were making these statements &#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, your honor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT: &#8212; but you did not correct them?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes &#8212; well, I corrected them when I was aware of it, but I did not correct them when I found out afterwards. I couldn't do anything about it, I thought. The attorney since advised me there was something legally I could have done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government then submitted for the court's consideration a number of documents and faxes, which Cheal admitted were all in her handwriting, and recorded telephone conversations, in which Cheal admitted participating. This evidence showed conclusively that Cheal herself had represented that the scheme would return 100% per week for twelve weeks, that she was an experienced securities trader, that she had secured the services of another experienced trader, and that the lenders' money would be kept in a safe, nondepletion account and would not itself be risked in the trades.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This proffer of evidence, when combined with Cheal's own statements to the court, satisfied Rule 11's requirement of a factual basis for a plea of guilty, even if Cheal never admitted explicitly to a \"knowing and willing participation\" in the scheme, <i>Martin,</i> 228 F.3d at 15. On the basis of what it described as \"her statements to the court, on the tapes that she acknowledges are in her voice, [and] the letters and statements that are in her hand and/or signed by her,\" the district court was free to infer that Cheal had the requisite <i>mens rea, Marrero-Rivera,</i> 124 F.3d at 352, and that the plea otherwise had a rational basis in fact.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cheal's argument is fundamentally flawed because it assumes that the district court could rely only on her admissions in court to find a sufficient factual basis to accept her plea. As <i>Gandia-Maysonet</i> and our other cases make clear, the court may find such a basis either in the defendant's admissions or from the government's presentation. In this case, not only did Cheal admit to substantial wrongdoing, including acknowledging repeatedly that she made numerous \"reckless\" decisions with investors' money, but the government also made extensive proffers of evidence &#8212; faxes in Cheal's handwriting and telephone calls in her voice &#8212; that it intended to use at trial. Given the wealth of information available to the court from these two sources, it did not err in finding a sufficient factual basis to accept Cheal's plea of guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">2. <i>Cheal's Understanding of the Nature of the Charges and the Consequences of Her Plea</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure ensures that a defendant who pleads guilty does so with an \"understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of his plea.\" <i>McCarthy v. United States,</i> 394 U.S. 459, 467, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 22 L.Ed.2d 418 (1969). Cheal argues repetitiously that her insistent denials at the change-of-plea hearing show that she could not have understood the charges against her or the consequences of her plea. We have already rejected this argument's premise &#8212; that Cheal did not admit to enough facts to allow the court to accept her guilty plea. Moreover, her factual disagreements, arguably skirting the edges of culpability, reveal the extent to which she fully understood the charges against her and the consequences of her plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In further support of her claim of confusion about the consequences of her plea, Cheal notes that, at one point in the hearing, she denied that she had told investors that their money would not be risked in the trades, and she said that a business associate of hers \"would come here and testify to this if it goes to the jury.... I was using my own money to trade.\" Cheal contends that this reference to a possible trial \"clearly shows the confusion she had regarding the purpose of the plea hearing. At the same time that Ms. Cheal is asserting her innocence, she is stating that she has witnesses who would testify at trial. Based on these statements alone an obvious confusion exists.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree. In assessing Cheal's claim of confusion, we must review the totality of the Rule 11 hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What is critical is the substance of what was communicated by the trial court, and what should reasonably have been understood by the defendant, rather than the form of the communication. At a minimum, Rule 11 requires that the trial court address the defendant personally in open court to ascertain that his plea is voluntary and intelligent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v. Cotal-Crespo,</i> 47 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1995) (citations omitted). We find that this minimum requirement was met here when, later in the hearing, the court explicitly asked Cheal if she understood that, with a guilty plea, she was giving up her right to a jury trial and her right to call witnesses on her behalf. To those questions, Cheal answered yes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cheal also complains that, after the government's proffer, the court did not immediately follow up by asking her whether she agreed with the evidence presented. Instead, the court launched into a series of questions asking Cheal whether she understood the maximum penalties under the mail and wire fraud laws, the sentencing guidelines, her right to trial, her right to counsel, and the other usual inquiries. \"Thus,\" Cheal says, \"despite the [court's] being cognizant of the Appellant's assertion of innocence, [it] makes no further inquiry of the Appellant regarding an acknowledgment of guilt nor does the [court] ascertain through further inquiry whether the Appellant's plea was knowing, voluntary and intelligent.\" Yet the colloquy cited by Cheal, required by Rule 11 and routine in change-of-plea hearings, is designed to confirm a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent plea. In Cheal's case, the colloquy did just that. Cheal's responses to the court's questions asking whether she understood the proceedings were almost always in the affirmative. When she said that she did not understand her right against self-incrimination, the court explained that right to her until Cheal said she did understand it. Cheal's insistence on that explanation confirms that she was not merely giving mindless answers to the court's other questions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> There was no error in the court's conduct of the change-of-plea hearing and its eventual acceptance of her guilty plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Sentencing Adjustment Based on Obstruction of Justice</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cheal challenges the two-level upward adjustment to her sentence under USSG &#167; 3C1.1 for obstruction of justice, arguing that the court made no \"suitable findings\" at the sentencing hearing to support the adjustment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> This argument has no merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As usual, we review a district court's legal interpretation of the guideline de novo and review the court's fact-finding for clear error, giving due deference to the court's application of the guidelines to the facts. <i>United States v. Mitchell,</i> 85 F.3d 800, 813 (1st Cir.1996). USSG &#167; 3C1.1 provides for a two-level upward adjustment where the defendant \"willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the course of the investigation... of the instant offense of conviction....\" The adjustment's commentary advises that it applies to, among other kinds of conduct, a defendant who has given a \"materially false statement to a law enforcement officer that significantly obstructed or impeded the official investigation or prosecution of the instant offense.\" USSG &#167; 3C1.1, cmt. n.4. At Cheal's sentencing hearing, the district court stated that the adjustment was \"primarily based on Ms. Cheal's conduct with the postal inspector, Keith. She did not follow his orders, the money was not returned, and the scheme continued at least for a period of time after that. It seems to me that does amount to obstruction of justice.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cheal argues that we should set this adjustment aside because the district court failed to take direct testimony on this point and failed to make a specific finding that her actions \"significantly\" obstructed the investigation, in the commentary's words. In support of this argument, she repeats her claim here, made to the district court as well, that the postal inspector never gave her a copy of the laws she was violating and never told her that the laws prohibited her from receiving monies through private couriers like Federal Express as well as through the U.S. mail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, the district court did address these points at the hearing and quickly rejected them, saying simply: \"I understand that, and that objection is overruled.\" No more was needed, especially when the court had already adopted the whole of the PSR's factual findings, which thoroughly cover the details of Cheal's meetings with the postal inspector (and do not support her version of the encounters advanced in her brief). The district court committed no error by imposing the adjustment for obstruction of justice in the way it did.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Denial of Downward Departure Based on Diminished Mental Capacity</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cheal argues that the district court erred by failing to hold a hearing on whether she was entitled to a downward departure based on diminished mental capacity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> The decision to hold an evidentiary hearing during the sentencing phase is within the discretion of the district court. <i>United States v. Robles-Torres,</i> 109 F.3d 83, 85 (1st Cir.1997). Consequently, if the district court had denied a request from Cheal for such a hearing, we would review for abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, however, Cheal did not even make such a request. \"It is ... clear that, at a bare minimum, he who expects to receive a discretionary dispensation must first seek it. Thus, the failure to ask the district court to convene an evidentiary hearing ordinarily spells defeat for a contention that one should have been held.\" <i>United States v. Tardiff,</i> 969 F.2d 1283, 1286 (1st Cir.1992). That is so because our review under these circumstances is for plain error only.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Cheal registered no such objection at the sentencing hearing, she now contends that the court erred in its description of the evaluations from the psychiatrists for the government and the defense. At the sentencing hearing, the court said that the reports \"agree that she's not entitled to a finding of diminished capacity.\" In fact, the defense psychiatrist's evaluation stated that, while Cheal was competent to stand trial, \"it is my opinion that she would meet the statutory criteria of the United States sentencing guidelines for diminished capacity.\" He added that Cheal \"did ... have a significantly reduced mental capacity.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the same time, however, the evaluation of the defense psychiatrist contained observations suggesting that Cheal possessed a normal mental capacity, at least at the time of the evaluation. It noted that she did not \"appear to have any disorganization in her thought flow, nor does she suffer from any hallucinations. Her intellectual faculties appear to be intact with no cognitive deficits or decrease in her intellectual ability.\" Ultimately, the psychiatrist concluded that \"she knew that what she was doing was wrong, but did not fully appreciate the wrongfulness of her conduct because, in her psychotic state, [she] believed that what she was doing was proper and moral.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the district court erred when it stated that both psychiatrists had the same opinion as to Cheal's entitlement to a departure based on mental capacity (they did not), the more critical consideration for plain-error review is whether the reports were so divergent that the court could not reasonably rely on them to reject Cheal's claim of diminished mental capacity without holding an evidentiary hearing. They were not. The court committed no plain error when it stated, on the evidence before it, that \"I do not believe that any of the grounds advanced by the defendant are sufficient for a departure.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. The Restitution Order</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cheal's last claim of error on the timing of her restitution order presents an issue of first impression for us. As part of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), Congress passed the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (MVRA), which, as its title suggests, made restitution mandatory for the victims of certain crimes, including mail and wire fraud, regardless of the defendant's ability to pay.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3663A and 3664. Section 3664, titled \"Procedure for issuance and enforcement of order of restitution,\" provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the victim's losses are not ascertainable by the date that is 10 days prior to sentencing, the attorney for the Government or the probation officer shall so inform the court, and the court shall set a date for the final determination of the victim's losses, not to exceed 90 days after sentencing. If a victim subsequently discovers further losses, the victim shall have 60 days after discovery of those losses in which to petition the court for an amended restitution order. Such order may be granted only upon a showing of good cause for the failure to include such losses in the initial claim for restitutionary relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> &#167; 3664(d)(5).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At Cheal's sentencing hearing on February 20, 2003, the government asked the district court to order restitution, estimated at around $2.5 million, but requested an additional 90 days under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3664 to provide a final list of victims and amounts owed. The court informed Cheal of its ruling on this request:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You shall pay restitution. There will be a restitution order. I cannot now designate the amount nor the payees. And under 18 U.S.C. 3664(d)(5), I will grant a 90-day period for the U.S. Attorney's office to come to a number and share with Mr. Murray [trial counsel for the defense] so that we can have hopefully an agreed amount.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 25, 2003, the court entered judgment in the case, stating: \"The determination of restitution is deferred until 5/25/03. An amended judgment in a criminal case will be entered after such a determination.\" On May 21, 2003, the government filed a memorandum with the court identifying 2,350 individual victims and the amounts owed them, which totaled just under $2.1 million. On the same day, it served this memorandum on Cheal's trial counsel, Robert Murray.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the prior three months, however, with the approval of this Court, Cheal had changed attorneys. On March 4, 2003, Cheal had filed her notice of appeal. On April 4, 2003, Cheal filed a <i>pro se</i> motion requesting us to appoint an attorney \"to handle my appeal, my stay, and whatever else is necessary at this time.\" On the same day, we ordered that \"new appellate counsel shall be appointed.\" On April 10, 2003, we appointed Cheal's current appellate counsel, allowed trial counsel (Murray) to \"withdraw as counsel for appellant,\" and ordered Murray to forward the case record to appellate counsel by April 24, 2003. It appears that the district court was not advised of this change in Cheal's counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, on June 27, 2003, the district court issued an Amended Judgment and Order requiring Cheal to make restitution in the amounts and to the victims specified in the government's list. This order noted: \"No opposition to these numbers and amounts has been filed.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cheal makes three arguments based on this history. First, the district court did not enter its order for restitution until June 27, 2003 &#8212; 127 days after the February 20, 2003 sentencing hearing, rather than within the required 90 days. Cheal contends that this delay rendered the order invalid.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> Second, Cheal claims that she was not given notice of, and hence had no opportunity to object to, the government's victims' loss list because the list was sent to her old trial counsel instead of her new appellate counsel. Third, the court should have considered her ability to pay in calculating the amount of restitution owed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review restitution orders for abuse of discretion and their subsidiary findings of fact for clear error. <i>United States v. Cutter,</i> 313 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2002). If the appellant's challenge is based on a legal conclusion, we review that conclusion <i>de novo. Id.</i> at 6. Where the defendant has failed to object below, however, we review only for plain error. <i>United States v. Theodore,</i> 354 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.2003). Under this standard, Cheal must show \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected [her] substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Duarte,</i> 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.2001). After considering Cheal's arguments, we affirm the restitution order in its entirety.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">1. <i>The Timing of the Restitution Order</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the government concedes that the order was not entered within 90 days of sentencing, it urges us to overlook this irregularity to further the statute's purpose of increasing the likelihood that victims of crime will receive restitution from the defendant. The government also argues that the court's statements about restitution at the change-of-plea and sentencing hearings and in the original judgment gave notice to Cheal that she would face a restitution order after a delay of 90 days. Finally, the government notes that Cheal has never objected to restitution, either at the sentencing hearing or after the original judgment, and even now has not identified any actual disagreement with the order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cheal had the opportunity to object to the district court's scheduling of a deferred restitution order but did not. When the court entered judgment on February 25, 2003, it deferred determination of restitution until May 25, 2003, and indicated that it would enter an amended judgment at some unspecified time thereafter. Even though it was now a virtual certainty that the restitution order would be entered more than 90 days after her sentencing, Cheal did not object. By failing to object at the time, Cheal subjected her appellate claim of error to plain-error review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cheal cites no prejudice from the delay in entering the restitution order. Indeed, as the government points out, she does not claim even now that she disagrees with the government's accounting of her victims' losses and the court's final determination. In an effort to avoid the prejudice showing required by plain error, Cheal argues that &#167; 3664 is a jurisdictional provision. That is, by not entering a restitution order within 90 days after her sentencing hearing, Cheal argues, the district court no longer had jurisdiction to enter any restitution order. This jurisdictional argument is undermined by &#167; 3664's provision for continued revision of the restitution order in light of later discoveries of losses. Indeed, the title of the provision (\"Procedure for issuance and enforcement of order of restitution\") advertises its procedural nature, including the 90-day time frame.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislative history of the MVRA reveals Congress's determination to provide full restitution to victims of fraud if at all possible. The Senate Judiciary Committee, in its report on the bill that would become the MVRA, stated: \"It is essential that the criminal justice system recognize the impact that crime has on the victim, and, to the extent possible, ensure that [the] offender be held accountable to repay these costs.\" S.Rep. No. 104-179, at 18 (1995), <i>reprinted in</i> 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 924, 930.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> Although the Committee acknowledged the importance of \"the need for finality and certainty in the sentencing process,\" it added that \"justice cannot be considered served until full restitution is made.\" <i>Id.</i> at 20.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> The Committee did not relate the 90-day requirement to the interests of defendants, stating that the \"sole due process interest of the defendant being protected during the sentencing phase is the right not to be sentenced on the basis of invalid premises or inaccurate information.\" <i>Id. See United States v. Zakhary,</i> 357 F.3d 186, 191 (2d Cir.2004) (\"As this court has now twice explained, the purpose behind the statutory ninety-day limit on the determination of victims' losses is not to protect defendants from drawn-out sentencing proceedings or to establish finality; rather, it is to protect crime victims from the willful dissipation of defendants' assets.\"). The Seventh Circuit has also emphasized that the MVRA's \"intended beneficiaries are the victims, not the victimizers.\" <i>United States v. Grimes,</i> 173 F.3d 634, 639 (7th Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cheal's timing argument would abrogate an obligation to pay more than $2 million in restitution to thousands of defrauded investors. On the facts here, such an outcome would be antithetical to the purpose of the MVRA. Moreover, a finding of plain error in Cheal's favor would turn the plain-error doctrine on its head by \"seriously impair[ing] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\" <i>Duarte,</i> 246 F.3d at 60. <i>See Johnson v. United States,</i> 520 U.S. 461, 470, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997) (\"Indeed, it would be the reversal of a conviction such as this which would have that effect.\") We will not countenance such a result.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">2. <i>Notice to Cheal's Trial Counsel</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted, the court entered judgment in this case on February 25, 2003. Cheal filed her notice of appeal from that judgment on March 4, 2003. On April 4, she filed a <i>pro se</i> motion in this Court for new counsel. We issued an order on April 10, 2003, allowing her trial counsel to withdraw and appointing new appellate counsel, even though Cheal's restitution order was still pending in the district court and she continued to need the services of her trial counsel. Although Cheal's motion asked for counsel to be appointed for her appeal and \"for whatever else is necessary at this time,\" our order requiring trial counsel to forward the case record to new appellate counsel by April 24 implies that we thought the proceedings in the district court were finished.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, both the district court and the government seemed unaware of the change in counsel that we had approved. When the government finished preparing its memorandum identifying Cheal's victims and their losses, it sent the memo to Cheal's trial counsel, whom we had allowed to withdraw a month and a half before. When the district court entered an amended judgment a month after receiving the government's memo, it also listed Cheal's trial counsel on its order and wrote that \"[n]o opposition to these numbers and amount has been filed.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cheal argues that she filed no opposition because the failure of coordination between the district court and our court on the important matter of which attorney represented her meant that her attorney never received notice of the pending restitution order. Regrettably, it appears that there was uncertainty among everyone involved &#8212; former trial counsel, new appellate counsel, the government, and the district and appellate courts &#8212; over the question of Cheal's legal representation in the still incomplete restitution proceedings. This uncertainty lends force to Cheal's claim that she never received proper notice of the pending restitution order. The absence of such notice is a serious matter. However, even after the five-and-a-half months between the court's entry of its restitution order and the filing of Cheal's brief on appeal (from June 27 to December 12, 2003), Cheal's brief does not contain even a bare-bones assertion that she disputes anything in the restitution order. She merely asserts that she is entitled to an evidentiary hearing because she did not get one before.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cheal's due process claim cannot succeed without at least some showing of the challenge she would mount to the restitution order. <i>See United States v. Luciano-Mosquera,</i> 63 F.3d 1142, 1158 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"[t]he defendant must show prejudice\" to prove that his right to due process was violated when a court reporter's failure to provide transcripts delayed processing of his appeal); <i>see also United States v. Lovasco,</i> 431 U.S. 783, 790, 97 S.Ct. 2044, 52 L.Ed.2d 752 (1977) (\"[P]roof of prejudice is generally a necessary but not sufficient element of a due process claim....\") Cheal has not made even a minimal showing of the challenge to restitution that she would make at an evidentiary hearing. Under these circumstances, despite the regrettable problems with notice of the proposed restitution order, we must reject her due process claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, we must add an explanatory note about future cases, like this one, involving deferred restitution orders at the time that a defendant files a notice of appeal from the entry of judgment. There might be a question whether the judgment of conviction entered on February 25, 2003, which imposed Cheal's sentence but only ordered restitution in general terms, was a final judgment that triggered the running of the appeal period. Arguably, the judgment was not truly final until June 27, 2003, when the district court issued an Amended Judgment and Order requiring Cheal to make restitution in the amounts and to the victims specified in the government's list. Despite these plausible arguments, we must treat the February judgment as final and appealable because of a statutory provision in the MVRA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 3664(<i>o</i>) provides: \"A sentence that imposes an order of restitution is a final judgment notwithstanding the fact that such a sentence can subsequently be corrected ...; appealed and modified...; amended under subsection (d)(5); or adjusted....\" As we have already mentioned, subsection (d)(5) addresses itself to two situations that may require changes to a restitution order. First, where the victim's losses cannot be determined before sentencing, it provides an extra 90 days for a \"final determination.\" Second, where the \"final determination\" has failed to account for some victims who did not discover their losses until later, subsection (d)(5) provides such victims \"60 days after discovery of those losses in which to petition the court for an amended restitution order.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3664(d)(5). Section 3664(<i>o</i>)'s instruction, then, to disregard for purposes of finality restitution orders \"<i>amended</i> under subsection (d)(5)\" could be read narrowly as encompassing only the second situation, which specifically provides for \"an <i>amended</i> restitution order.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, we decline to read &#167; 3664(<i>o</i>) so narrowly. The provision states that courts should treat a \"sentence that imposes an order of restitution\" as final, notwithstanding the possibility of subsequent modification. In Cheal's case, the February judgment imposed a restitution obligation. The court stated in the judgment: \"The defendant shall pay the balance of the restitution according to a court-ordered repayment schedule.\" Although the specific amounts of restitution and the list of victims were yet to be determined, an \"order of restitution\" (the phrase used in &#167; 3664(<i>o</i>)) had been entered. Sensibly and properly, the court advised Cheal of her right to appeal from the sentence that it had just imposed: \"You are advised, Ms. Cheal, that you have the right [to] appeal from the sentence by filing a notice of appeal. I ask Mr. Murray to talk with you about this and file such a notice within ten days if you decide to appeal.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A contrary rule &#8212; one that linked the finality of the judgment of conviction to a later restitution order that included specific amounts and victims &#8212; would have troubling consequences for defendants, who have an obvious and legitimate interest in pursuing a timely appeal. This interest would be compromised if the judgment of conviction were not final until the final restitution determination was reflected in an order of the court. Indeed, a defendant could already be incarcerated without the ability to pursue an appeal until the specifics of restitution are later determined. For these reasons of statutory language and policy, we conclude that the February judgment was one that \"impose[d] an order of restitution\" on Cheal within the meaning of &#167; 3664(<i>o</i>) and was final and appealable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, this conclusion raises a question as to whether Cheal's notice of appeal from the February judgment, filed <i>pro se</i> on March 4, 2003, served to bring before us the Amended Judgment and Order of June 27, 2003, which specified the restitution amounts owed to identified victims. Fed. R.App. P. 3(c)(1)(B) provides that the notice of appeal must \"designate the judgment, order, or part thereof being appealed.\" The defendant must file the notice of appeal within ten days after the entry of judgment or the order being appealed. <i>See</i> Fed. R.App. P. 4(b). Typically, these rules prevent a court of appeals from considering any orders or judgments besides those designated in the appellant's notice of appeal. In the case of an amended judgment or a later order that is substantively different, an appellant may have to amend his notice of appeal or file a new one. \"The settled rule is that the non-substantive revision of a previously entered judgment does not restart or otherwise affect the period within which appellate review must be sought. It is only when the judgment-issuing court alters matters of substance or resolves some genuine ambiguity that the entry of an amended judgment winds the appeals clock anew.\" <i>Air Line Pilots Ass'n v. Precision Valley Aviation, Inc.,</i> 26 F.3d 220, 223 n. 2 (1st Cir.1994) (internal citations omitted).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> Cheal's March 4 notice of appeal stated in full: \"Notice is hereby given that Nancy Cheal in the above named case hereby appeals to the United States Court of Appeals for the 6th [sic] Circuit from a judgment and sentence entered in this action on the 20th [sic] day of February, 2003.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> Arguably, she should have filed a second notice of appeal from the Amended Judgment and Order of restitution of June 27, 2003. Indeed, looking to the future, we think that, as a general proposition, a deferred restitution order entered pursuant to &#167; 3664(d)(5), subsequent to a final judgment of conviction which has already been appealed, should be the subject of a second notice of appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, however, we consider the adequacy of Cheal's March 4 notice of appeal in light of general principles that \"encourage us to construe notices of appeal liberally and examine them in the context of the record as a whole.\" <i>Chamorro v. Puerto Rican Cars, Inc.,</i> 304 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.2002); <i>see also Blockel v. J.C. Penney Co., Inc.,</i> 337 F.3d 17, 23-4 (1st Cir.2003). The core purpose of a notice of appeal is to \"facilitate a proper decision on the merits.\" <i>Foman v. Davis,</i> 371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a> Cheal's notice of appeal was sufficiently clear in its intent to challenge all elements of her conviction and sentence, which, as we have noted, imposed a general restitution obligation. There is also no question here of surprise or prejudice to the government. <i>See United States v. Winn,</i> 948 F.2d 145, 154-55 (5th Cir.1991) (treating a pre-judgment notice of appeal as effective, where the defendant's intent to appeal ruling was clear and the government was not prejudiced or misled). Both sides fully briefed the restitution issues on appeal. Therefore, on the facts here, we conclude that Cheal's notice of appeal filed on March 4, 2003, served to bring the restitution order of June 27, 2003, before us for appellate consideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">3. <i>Considering Cheal's Ability To Pay When Ordering Restitution</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cheal argues, citing <i>United States v.

The MVRA gives the court no discretion in ordering restitution in cases of fraud, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663A(c)(1), or in calculating the amount of restitution owed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In each order of restitution, the court shall order restitution to each victim in the full amount of each victim's losses as determined by the court and without consideration of the economic circumstances of the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> &#167; 3664(f)(1)(A). <i>See United States v.

Cheal did not object below to the repayment plan, and she does not do so now. In any event, &#167; 3664(k) requires her to notify the court of \"any material change in the defendant's economic circumstances that might affect the defendant's ability to pay restitution.\" This provision accounts both for windfalls and for tighter times.

While the number of victims here gave the government considerable trouble in compiling a full, accurate list of losses, Cheal has not suggested that this provision applies here</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3664(d)(5) uses two phrases whose precise meanings have not been explored by this Court. First, &#167; 3664(d)(5) refers to a \"final determination of the victim's losses\" but not specifically to the initial order for restitution. Other courts to consider this point have found that \"final determination\" in this context must mean the initial order itself. \"[T]he provision that a victim may `petition the court for an amended restitution order' would have no meaning unless the order had been entered.\"<i>United States v. Stevens,</i> 211 F.3d 1, 4 (2d Cir.2000). <i>See also United States v. Jolivette,</i> 257 F.3d 581, 584 (6th Cir.2001); <i>United States v. Maung,</i> 267 F.3d 1113, 1121 (11th Cir.2001); <i>United States v. Grimes,</i> 173 F.3d 634, 639-40 (7th Cir.1999). We agree with these courts, although we note that, elsewhere, &#167; 3664 does distinguish between the determination and the order. <i>See</i> &#167;&#167; 3664(f)(1)(A) (\"In each order of restitution, the court shall order restitution to each victim in the full amount of each victim's losses as determined by the court....\") and 3664(f)(2) (\"Upon determination of the amount of restitution owed to each victim, the court shall ... specify in the restitution order the manner in which, and the schedule according to which, the restitution is to be paid....\").</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Second, &#167; 3664(d)(5) keys its time periods to \"sentencing\" &#8212; \"10 days prior to sentencing,\" \"90 days after sentencing\" &#8212; but does not specify whether this term refers to the sentencing hearing or to the district court's actual entry of judgment. We conclude that \"sentencing\" in this provision refers to the sentencing hearing for four reasons. First, we read this provision in conjunction with &#167; 3664(d)(1), which requires the government to provide the probation officer with a listing of the amounts subject to restitution \"not later than 60 days prior to the date initially set for sentencing.\" It makes more sense to speak of the district court setting a date for the sentencing hearing, rather than for entry of judgment, which is not usually done on some preset date. Second, because of the usual uncertainty about precisely when a district court plans to enter judgment, it would be difficult to calculate the date that would fall \"10 days prior to sentencing\" as provided by &#167; 3664(d)(5) (which provides that \"[i]f the victim's losses are not ascertainable by the date that is 10 days prior to sentencing, the attorney for the Government or the probation officer shall so inform the court.\") Third, our interpretation is more consistent with the language of Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i), titled \"Sentencing,\" which begins: \"At sentencing,\" and goes on to refer to the sentencing hearing. Fourth, keying this 10-day deadline to the sentencing hearing gives better expression to a Congressional intent to allow the defendant to develop objections to the government's data in time to present them at the sentencing hearing.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> <i>See United States v.

Were we to read it as terminating a court's jurisdiction 90 days after a sentencing hearing, we would be effectively nullifying its provision that a victim may petition the court for an amended restitution order 60 days after the discovery of any additional losses. The MVRA permits amendments to restitution orders to reflect changed circumstances, and neither confers nor terminates a court's jurisdiction.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">201 F.3d at 814 (citation omitted). A year later, however, <i>United States v. Jolivette,</i> 257 F.3d 581 (6th Cir.2001), came to a different and seemingly irreconcilable conclusion: \"We believe that [the MVRA] makes clear the congressional intent to prohibit courts from making restitution determinations after the statutory period has run.... [W]e hold that when the 90-day clock runs out, the judgment of conviction and sentence, including the restitution provision, becomes final by operation of the statute.\" <i>Jolivette,</i> 257 F.3d at 584. Strangely, <i>Jolivette</i> did not cite <i>Vandeberg</i> or refer to it in any way.

In truth, &#167; 3664's one-size-fits-all 90-day deadline seems poorly suited for complex cases involving thousands of victims and millions of dollars in losses. Other courts of appeals have offered advice on how to comply with &#167; 3664's time limits and still render a complete and accurate accounting of the defendant's misconduct. The Eleventh Circuit, for example, has suggested that if district courts foresee a problem with getting the restitution order entered within 90 days of sentencing, they \"can postpone sentencing and thereby put off the start of the 90-day period.\"<i>United States v. Maung,</i> 267 F.3d 1113, 1121 (11th Cir.2001).

Sullivan, U.S. Attorney, was on brief, for appellee.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge, GIBSON, Senior Circuit Judge<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s\" id=\"fn-s_ref\">*</a>, and LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant-appellant in this case, Nancy J. Cheal, pleaded guilty to five counts of mail fraud (18 U.S.C. &#167; 1341) and two counts of wire fraud (18 U.S.C. &#167; 1343), after being charged with bilking investors out of more than $2 million in an \"international bank trading\" scheme. The District Court then sentenced Cheal to a term of imprisonment of 87 months, with three years of supervised release to follow. The District Court also ordered Cheal to pay restitution in the amount of $2.1 million.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cheal now raises four issues on appeal: (1) the compliance of her change-of-plea hearing with the requirements of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure; (2) the evidentiary basis for the court's enhancement for obstruction of justice; (3) the court's failure to grant a downward departure on the basis of her alleged reduced mental capacity; (4) the timeliness of the court's entry of a restitution order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cheal's argument about the timing of her restitution order raises an issue of first impression in this circuit. Congress passed the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1227 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 18 U.S.C.), to provide full restitution to identifiable victims of certain crimes, including mail and wire fraud, regardless of a defendant's ability to pay. One provision of that act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3664(d)(5), directs that \"the court shall set a date for the final determination of the victim's losses, not to exceed 90 days after sentencing.\" Cheal argues that the restitution order in this case, which was entered 127 days after sentencing, was invalid. As we explain below, any error that the district court may have committed by entering Cheal's restitution order after the 90-day period did not constitute plain error. We therefore affirm Cheal's convictions and sentence in their entirety.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We take the facts from the presentence report (\"PSR\"), the transcript of the plea hearing, and the district court's findings. <i>See United States v. Voccola,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197057\"><a href=\"/opinion/197057/united-states-v-voccola/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, 43 (1st Cir.1996).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of her criminal conduct, Nancy Cheal was 60 years old and lived in a five-bedroom double-wide trailer home along with her second husband and four great-grandchildren. She describes herself as the pastor to a small, nondenominational church in her hometown of Bunnell, Florida.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beginning approximately eight years before the criminal conduct at issue in this case, Cheal ran a business out of her home called Relief Enterprise, Inc. Cheal claimed to run several private clubs somehow connected to Relief Enterprise with such names as the \"Get America Out of Debt Private Club,\" the \"Fatherless Children Private Club,\" and the \"Senior Citizens' Private Club.\" Although the purpose served by these clubs is not clear, they seemed to be perpetually short of the funds that Cheal solicited on their behalf.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1999, Cheal organized and began to advertise the investment scheme that led to her criminal convictions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Its basic nature was simple fraud: by falsely asserting that she was an experienced trader in international securities and had the help of another experienced trader, Cheal induced thousands of investors to send her money in the hopes of an astronomical return on their investment. She told investors that the scheme paid 100% of the initial investment per week for twelve weeks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cheal was vague about the mechanism behind these remarkable numbers, referring only to \"overseas trading\" of some kind and the services of a renowned trader of international securities, one of only seven people in the world licensed to trade in a certain (unspecified) kind of investment. She also claimed to have trading experience herself. Cheal insisted that investors' money would not itself be used for the trades; instead, she would place it in a \"safekeeping, non-depletion\" account, which meant that it would not be risked in the deal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cheal also laced the scheme with religious and charitable elements, sometimes claiming that Relief Enterprise had bought a bank in Oklahoma, which, because it was on an \"Indian Reservation,\" would not be subject to the usual federal regulations and could therefore offer mortgages at extremely low rates to help poor people buy homes. At other times, Cheal claimed that the purpose of the enterprise was to raise money to build a church. Although the precise charitable purposes varied, Cheal consistently maintained that she wanted to benefit the public and \"help the little guy.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Along with other employees of Relief Enterprise working at her direction, Cheal disseminated her investment offer through faxes, e-mails, letters, and telephone calls. A referral fee of 1 to 5% also provided an incentive for people to spread the word. As a result of these efforts, Relief Enterprise managed to raise more than $2 million in a few months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not surprisingly, Relief Enterprise did not make its promised payments. Originally, the first payouts were to come in late October or early November 1999. As those dates came and went, Cheal offered excuses for the delay, ranging from a death in the trader's family to the Y2K computer bug. Then Cheal's scheme came to the attention of law enforcement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 27, 1999, a disgruntled investor contacted the U.S. Secret Service with complaints about Relief Enterprise. Because of the use of the mails to carry out the scheme, the Secret Service passed the complaints on to the U.S. Postal Service. On October 28, a postal inspector, Louis Keith, met Cheal at a convenience store near her home for an interview. Cheal signed two declarations stating that she \"initially had a solicitation to obtain loans to build a church\" and that others had modified this solicitation without her knowledge or consent. Estimating that Relief Enterprise had so far collected between three and four thousand dollars, she said that she would refund the money by November 1 that had been sent to her by wire transfer and would return to the inspector all funds received in letters and packages. Finally, she promised \"to cease receiving letters and packages relating to this solicitation and return them to the sender,\" and she authorized the Postal Service to intercept and return any future packages on her behalf.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 8, 1999, Cheal met again with Inspector Keith and gave him a box containing 1,296 checks totaling approximately $171,000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> At this meeting, Inspector Keith confronted Cheal with evidence that she had made the 1200% (100% per week over twelve weeks) offer herself to at least one investor. She admitted that she had and that she \"may\" have made the offer to others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cheal, however, was deceiving Inspector Keith at this meeting. Rather than returning to him all of the funds that Relief Enterprise had so far collected, she had in fact instructed her employees to segregate investments into those worth less than $400 and those worth more. The smaller investments she gave to Inspector Keith; the larger investments, equaling at that point at least $1.3 million, she kept.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequently, Cheal contacted the senders of the smaller investments to explain her legal difficulties and to ask them to send their money again by a private courier such as Federal Express or UPS. In some cases, one of Cheal's employees even explained that she had given the postal inspector only checks for less than $400 and had kept the rest and asked the investors to keep this information a secret.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Cheal continued soliciting new investments as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cheal used the proceeds from her investment scheme in a variety of ways. She paid off more than $100,000 in personal debt, gave $110,000 to a friend, gave bonuses to her attorney and employees, and made numerous purchases, including a minivan, a new trailer home for $67,000, and a big-screen TV. At one point, she tried to buy a $400,000 home with cash but was turned down.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 28, 2001, a grand jury sitting in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts returned an indictment charging Cheal with defrauding others of more than $2.1 million. The indictment listed five counts of mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1341 and two counts of wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1343. Cheal was arrested on March 2, 2001, in the Middle District of Florida and released on bond. On March 13, 2001, Cheal appeared for arraignment before the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts, which appointed counsel for her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 6, 2001, the District Court ordered a psychiatric evaluation of Cheal. On January 8, 2002, after psychiatrists hired by the government and the defense had both advised that Cheal was competent to stand trial, the District Court agreed and the case moved forward.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 15, 2002, the first day of trial, Cheal pleaded guilty to all seven counts against her, and the court held a change-of-plea hearing as required by Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The Probation Office then prepared a PSR recommending a total offense level of 31 under the federal sentencing guidelines: a base offense level of 6, plus 13 because the total cost of the scheme to victims was more than $2.5 million, plus 2 for more-than-minimal planning, plus 2 because the crimes involved mass-marketing, plus 2 because Cheal misrepresented herself as acting on behalf of a charitable or religious agency. In addition, the PSR determined that Cheal should receive a four-level upward adjustment for her leadership role and a two-level upward adjustment for willful obstruction of justice. The PSR recommended that she receive no credit for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing on February 20, 2003, Cheal objected to the upward adjustment for willful obstruction and asked for a downward departure based on diminished mental capacity. The district court ultimately accepted the PSR's recommendations, except that it did grant a two-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. It also ordered restitution. Cheal filed a timely notice of appeal on March 4, 2003.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants who claim relief because of an allegedly flawed change-of-plea hearing face a high hurdle when they have not first raised their objections in the court below. <i>See United States v.

The Court held that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a defendant who seeks reversal of his conviction after a guilty plea, on the ground that the district court committed plain error under Rule 11, must show a reasonable probability that, but for the error, he would not have entered the plea. A defendant must thus satisfy the judgment of the reviewing court, informed by the entire record, that the probability of a different result is sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">124 S.Ct. at 2340 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).

Validity of Cheal's Plea Colloquy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cheal first contends that she consistently asserted her legal innocence throughout the hearing, never fully agreeing to the government's allegations and case against her, and that the court therefore lacked a sufficient factual basis to accept her plea. Second, Cheal claims that the court's failure to conduct the change-of-plea hearing in accordance with Rule 11 meant that she did not enter her plea intelligently, knowingly, and voluntarily. Although Cheal's behavior during the plea colloquy was erratic, her admissions, when combined with the government's evidence, provided a sufficient basis for the plea, and the court's procedure complied as a whole with Rule 11.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> There was no error in the conduct of the change-of-plea hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">1. <i>The Factual Basis for Cheal's Plea of Guilty</i></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Rule 11 requires that</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">there be an admission, colloquy, proffer, or some other basis for thinking that the defendant is at least arguably guilty....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On a plea, the question under Rule 11(f) is not whether a jury would, or even would be likely, to convict: it is whether there is enough evidence so that the plea has a rational basis in facts that the defendant concedes or that the government proffers as supported by credible evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v.

Cheal pleaded guilty to mail and wire fraud. To prove these crimes, the government must show three elements: (1) a scheme to defraud based on false pretenses; (2) the defendant's knowing and willing participation in the scheme with the intent to defraud; and (3) the use of interstate mail or wire communications in furtherance of that scheme. <i>United States v.

After the government's initial recitation of facts, for example, Cheal responded: \"I agree with ten percent of what he said, about ten percent of it is correct.\" She then delivered a rambling narrative of her own version of the facts, which included several denials that she was running or even knew about the investment scheme promising a 1200% return over twelve weeks. Cheal claimed that she had simply solicited loans to purchase a bank that would help fund low-cost mortgages, and that her employees had modified this plan without her consent or knowledge. At first, Cheal claimed she had never sent faxes to anyone. Then, when the court asked why she had a fax machine in her home, she said she had sometimes faxed back \"a prayer request,\" and then that she had responded to people \"after they had been promised a hundred percent return.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cheal also read a prepared statement in which she admitted that she misrepresented herself as being an experienced securities trader, that she \"recklessly mismanaged the loan proceeds received for Relief Enterprise from lenders,\" that \"in setting up these programs I made reckless decisions and judgments,\" and that she</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">recklessly allowed persons in my office ... to misrepresent the facts and nature of my loan program to prospective lenders which resulted in persons sending loan [sic] and money and applications to me with false information about the program.... Among the false statements provided to such lenders was that: (1) lenders could expect 100 percent of the loan value return from each one of their loans for twelve weeks ...; and (2) that all lenders' moneys were to be kept in a secured lenders' account. So, to all these charges I do plead guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a subsequent exchange with Cheal, the court tried to determine whether Cheal was admitting to having made the 1200% misrepresentation herself, or whether she was admitting only to failing to correct her employees' misrepresentations, which she had overheard:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT: So you acknowledge that people on your behalf were making these statements &#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, your honor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT: &#8212; but you did not correct them?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes &#8212; well, I corrected them when I was aware of it, but I did not correct them when I found out afterwards. I couldn't do anything about it, I thought. The attorney since advised me there was something legally I could have done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government then submitted for the court's consideration a number of documents and faxes, which Cheal admitted were all in her handwriting, and recorded telephone conversations, in which Cheal admitted participating. This evidence showed conclusively that Cheal herself had represented that the scheme would return 100% per week for twelve weeks, that she was an experienced securities trader, that she had secured the services of another experienced trader, and that the lenders' money would be kept in a safe, nondepletion account and would not itself be risked in the trades.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This proffer of evidence, when combined with Cheal's own statements to the court, satisfied Rule 11's requirement of a factual basis for a plea of guilty, even if Cheal never admitted explicitly to a \"knowing and willing participation\" in the scheme, <i>Martin,</i> 228 F.3d at 15. On the basis of what it described as \"her statements to the court, on the tapes that she acknowledges are in her voice, [and] the letters and statements that are in her hand and/or signed by her,\" the district court was free to infer that Cheal had the requisite <i>mens rea, Marrero-Rivera,</i> 124 F.3d at 352, and that the plea otherwise had a rational basis in fact.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cheal's argument is fundamentally flawed because it assumes that the district court could rely only on her admissions in court to find a sufficient factual basis to accept her plea. As <i>Gandia-Maysonet</i> and our other cases make clear, the court may find such a basis either in the defendant's admissions or from the government's presentation. In this case, not only did Cheal admit to substantial wrongdoing, including acknowledging repeatedly that she made numerous \"reckless\" decisions with investors' money, but the government also made extensive proffers of evidence &#8212; faxes in Cheal's handwriting and telephone calls in her voice &#8212; that it intended to use at trial. Given the wealth of information available to the court from these two sources, it did not err in finding a sufficient factual basis to accept Cheal's plea of guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">2. <i>Cheal's Understanding of the Nature of the Charges and the Consequences of Her Plea</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure ensures that a defendant who pleads guilty does so with an \"understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of his plea.\" <i>McCarthy v.

Cheal argues repetitiously that her insistent denials at the change-of-plea hearing show that she could not have understood the charges against her or the consequences of her plea. We have already rejected this argument's premise &#8212; that Cheal did not admit to enough facts to allow the court to accept her guilty plea. Moreover, her factual disagreements, arguably skirting the edges of culpability, reveal the extent to which she fully understood the charges against her and the consequences of her plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In further support of her claim of confusion about the consequences of her plea, Cheal notes that, at one point in the hearing, she denied that she had told investors that their money would not be risked in the trades, and she said that a business associate of hers \"would come here and testify to this if it goes to the jury.... I was using my own money to trade.\" Cheal contends that this reference to a possible trial \"clearly shows the confusion she had regarding the purpose of the plea hearing. At the same time that Ms. Cheal is asserting her innocence, she is stating that she has witnesses who would testify at trial. Based on these statements alone an obvious confusion exists.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree.

At a minimum, Rule 11 requires that the trial court address the defendant personally in open court to ascertain that his plea is voluntary and intelligent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v.

We find that this minimum requirement was met here when, later in the hearing, the court explicitly asked Cheal if she understood that, with a guilty plea, she was giving up her right to a jury trial and her right to call witnesses on her behalf. To those questions, Cheal answered yes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cheal also complains that, after the government's proffer, the court did not immediately follow up by asking her whether she agreed with the evidence presented. Instead, the court launched into a series of questions asking Cheal whether she understood the maximum penalties under the mail and wire fraud laws, the sentencing guidelines, her right to trial, her right to counsel, and the other usual inquiries. \"Thus,\" Cheal says, \"despite the [court's] being cognizant of the Appellant's assertion of innocence, [it] makes no further inquiry of the Appellant regarding an acknowledgment of guilt nor does the [court] ascertain through further inquiry whether the Appellant's plea was knowing, voluntary and intelligent.\" Yet the colloquy cited by Cheal, required by Rule 11 and routine in change-of-plea hearings, is designed to confirm a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent plea. In Cheal's case, the colloquy did just that. Cheal's responses to the court's questions asking whether she understood the proceedings were almost always in the affirmative. When she said that she did not understand her right against self-incrimination, the court explained that right to her until Cheal said she did understand it. Cheal's insistence on that explanation confirms that she was not merely giving mindless answers to the court's other questions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> There was no error in the court's conduct of the change-of-plea hearing and its eventual acceptance of her guilty plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B.

USSG &#167; 3C1.1 provides for a two-level upward adjustment where the defendant \"willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the course of the investigation... of the instant offense of conviction....\" The adjustment's commentary advises that it applies to, among other kinds of conduct, a defendant who has given a \"materially false statement to a law enforcement officer that significantly obstructed or impeded the official investigation or prosecution of the instant offense.\" USSG &#167; 3C1.1, cmt. n.4. At Cheal's sentencing hearing, the district court stated that the adjustment was \"primarily based on Ms. Cheal's conduct with the postal inspector, Keith. She did not follow his orders, the money was not returned, and the scheme continued at least for a period of time after that. It seems to me that does amount to obstruction of justice.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cheal argues that we should set this adjustment aside because the district court failed to take direct testimony on this point and failed to make a specific finding that her actions \"significantly\" obstructed the investigation, in the commentary's words. In support of this argument, she repeats her claim here, made to the district court as well, that the postal inspector never gave her a copy of the laws she was violating and never told her that the laws prohibited her from receiving monies through private couriers like Federal Express as well as through the U.S. mail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, the district court did address these points at the hearing and quickly rejected them, saying simply: \"I understand that, and that objection is overruled.\" No more was needed, especially when the court had already adopted the whole of the PSR's factual findings, which thoroughly cover the details of Cheal's meetings with the postal inspector (and do not support her version of the encounters advanced in her brief). The district court committed no error by imposing the adjustment for obstruction of justice in the way it did.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C.

Thus, the failure to ask the district court to convene an evidentiary hearing ordinarily spells defeat for a contention that one should have been held.\" <i>United States v.

At the sentencing hearing, the court said that the reports \"agree that she's not entitled to a finding of diminished capacity.\" In fact, the defense psychiatrist's evaluation stated that, while Cheal was competent to stand trial, \"it is my opinion that she would meet the statutory criteria of the United States sentencing guidelines for diminished capacity.\" He added that Cheal \"did ... have a significantly reduced mental capacity.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the same time, however, the evaluation of the defense psychiatrist contained observations suggesting that Cheal possessed a normal mental capacity, at least at the time of the evaluation. It noted that she did not \"appear to have any disorganization in her thought flow, nor does she suffer from any hallucinations. Her intellectual faculties appear to be intact with no cognitive deficits or decrease in her intellectual ability.\" Ultimately, the psychiatrist concluded that \"she knew that what she was doing was wrong, but did not fully appreciate the wrongfulness of her conduct because, in her psychotic state, [she] believed that what she was doing was proper and moral.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the district court erred when it stated that both psychiatrists had the same opinion as to Cheal's entitlement to a departure based on mental capacity (they did not), the more critical consideration for plain-error review is whether the reports were so divergent that the court could not reasonably rely on them to reject Cheal's claim of diminished mental capacity without holding an evidentiary hearing. They were not. The court committed no plain error when it stated, on the evidence before it, that \"I do not believe that any of the grounds advanced by the defendant are sufficient for a departure.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. The Restitution Order</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cheal's last claim of error on the timing of her restitution order presents an issue of first impression for us. As part of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), Congress passed the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (MVRA), which, as its title suggests, made restitution mandatory for the victims of certain crimes, including mail and wire fraud, regardless of the defendant's ability to pay.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3663A and 3664. Section 3664, titled \"Procedure for issuance and enforcement of order of restitution,\" provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the victim's losses are not ascertainable by the date that is 10 days prior to sentencing, the attorney for the Government or the probation officer shall so inform the court, and the court shall set a date for the final determination of the victim's losses, not to exceed 90 days after sentencing. If a victim subsequently discovers further losses, the victim shall have 60 days after discovery of those losses in which to petition the court for an amended restitution order. Such order may be granted only upon a showing of good cause for the failure to include such losses in the initial claim for restitutionary relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> &#167; 3664(d)(5).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At Cheal's sentencing hearing on February 20, 2003, the government asked the district court to order restitution, estimated at around $2.5 million, but requested an additional 90 days under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3664 to provide a final list of victims and amounts owed. The court informed Cheal of its ruling on this request:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You shall pay restitution. There will be a restitution order. I cannot now designate the amount nor the payees. And under 18 U.S.C. 3664(d)(5), I will grant a 90-day period for the U.S. Attorney's office to come to a number and share with Mr. Murray [trial counsel for the defense] so that we can have hopefully an agreed amount.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 25, 2003, the court entered judgment in the case, stating: \"The determination of restitution is deferred until 5/25/03. An amended judgment in a criminal case will be entered after such a determination.\" On May 21, 2003, the government filed a memorandum with the court identifying 2,350 individual victims and the amounts owed them, which totaled just under $2.1 million. On the same day, it served this memorandum on Cheal's trial counsel, Robert Murray.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the prior three months, however, with the approval of this Court, Cheal had changed attorneys. On March 4, 2003, Cheal had filed her notice of appeal. On April 4, 2003, Cheal filed a <i>pro se</i> motion requesting us to appoint an attorney \"to handle my appeal, my stay, and whatever else is necessary at this time.\" On the same day, we ordered that \"new appellate counsel shall be appointed.\" On April 10, 2003, we appointed Cheal's current appellate counsel, allowed trial counsel (Murray) to \"withdraw as counsel for appellant,\" and ordered Murray to forward the case record to appellate counsel by April 24, 2003. It appears that the district court was not advised of this change in Cheal's counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, on June 27, 2003, the district court issued an Amended Judgment and Order requiring Cheal to make restitution in the amounts and to the victims specified in the government's list. This order noted: \"No opposition to these numbers and amounts has been filed.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cheal makes three arguments based on this history. First, the district court did not enter its order for restitution until June 27, 2003 &#8212; 127 days after the February 20, 2003 sentencing hearing, rather than within the required 90 days. Cheal contends that this delay rendered the order invalid.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> Second, Cheal claims that she was not given notice of, and hence had no opportunity to object to, the government's victims' loss list because the list was sent to her old trial counsel instead of her new appellate counsel. Third, the court should have considered her ability to pay in calculating the amount of restitution owed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review restitution orders for abuse of discretion and their subsidiary findings of fact for clear error. <i>United States v.

If the appellant's challenge is based on a legal conclusion, we review that conclusion <i>de novo. Id.</i> at 6. Where the defendant has failed to object below, however, we review only for plain error. <i>United States v.

Under this standard, Cheal must show \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected [her] substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Duarte,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199375\"><a href=\"/opinion/199375/united-states-v-duarte/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 60 (1st Cir.2001). After considering Cheal's arguments, we affirm the restitution order in its entirety.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">1. <i>The Timing of the Restitution Order</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the government concedes that the order was not entered within 90 days of sentencing, it urges us to overlook this irregularity to further the statute's purpose of increasing the likelihood that victims of crime will receive restitution from the defendant. The government also argues that the court's statements about restitution at the change-of-plea and sentencing hearings and in the original judgment gave notice to Cheal that she would face a restitution order after a delay of 90 days. Finally, the government notes that Cheal has never objected to restitution, either at the sentencing hearing or after the original judgment, and even now has not identified any actual disagreement with the order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cheal had the opportunity to object to the district court's scheduling of a deferred restitution order but did not. When the court entered judgment on February 25, 2003, it deferred determination of restitution until May 25, 2003, and indicated that it would enter an amended judgment at some unspecified time thereafter. Even though it was now a virtual certainty that the restitution order would be entered more than 90 days after her sentencing, Cheal did not object. By failing to object at the time, Cheal subjected her appellate claim of error to plain-error review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cheal cites no prejudice from the delay in entering the restitution order. Indeed, as the government points out, she does not claim even now that she disagrees with the government's accounting of her victims' losses and the court's final determination. In an effort to avoid the prejudice showing required by plain error, Cheal argues that &#167; 3664 is a jurisdictional provision. That is, by not entering a restitution order within 90 days after her sentencing hearing, Cheal argues, the district court no longer had jurisdiction to enter any restitution order. This jurisdictional argument is undermined by &#167; 3664's provision for continued revision of the restitution order in light of later discoveries of losses. Indeed, the title of the provision (\"Procedure for issuance and enforcement of order of restitution\") advertises its procedural nature, including the 90-day time frame.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislative history of the MVRA reveals Congress's determination to provide full restitution to victims of fraud if at all possible. The Senate Judiciary Committee, in its report on the bill that would become the MVRA, stated: \"It is essential that the criminal justice system recognize the impact that crime has on the victim, and, to the extent possible, ensure that [the] offender be held accountable to repay these costs.\" S.Rep.

The Seventh Circuit has also emphasized that the MVRA's \"intended beneficiaries are the victims, not the victimizers.\" <i>United States v.

On the facts here, such an outcome would be antithetical to the purpose of the MVRA. Moreover, a finding of plain error in Cheal's favor would turn the plain-error doctrine on its head by \"seriously impair[ing] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\" <i>Duarte,</i> 246 F.3d at 60. <i>See Johnson v.

Cheal filed her notice of appeal from that judgment on March 4, 2003. On April 4, she filed a <i>pro se</i> motion in this Court for new counsel. We issued an order on April 10, 2003, allowing her trial counsel to withdraw and appointing new appellate counsel, even though Cheal's restitution order was still pending in the district court and she continued to need the services of her trial counsel. Although Cheal's motion asked for counsel to be appointed for her appeal and \"for whatever else is necessary at this time,\" our order requiring trial counsel to forward the case record to new appellate counsel by April 24 implies that we thought the proceedings in the district court were finished.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, both the district court and the government seemed unaware of the change in counsel that we had approved. When the government finished preparing its memorandum identifying Cheal's victims and their losses, it sent the memo to Cheal's trial counsel, whom we had allowed to withdraw a month and a half before. When the district court entered an amended judgment a month after receiving the government's memo, it also listed Cheal's trial counsel on its order and wrote that \"[n]o opposition to these numbers and amount has been filed.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cheal argues that she filed no opposition because the failure of coordination between the district court and our court on the important matter of which attorney represented her meant that her attorney never received notice of the pending restitution order. Regrettably, it appears that there was uncertainty among everyone involved &#8212; former trial counsel, new appellate counsel, the government, and the district and appellate courts &#8212; over the question of Cheal's legal representation in the still incomplete restitution proceedings. This uncertainty lends force to Cheal's claim that she never received proper notice of the pending restitution order. The absence of such notice is a serious matter. However, even after the five-and-a-half months between the court's entry of its restitution order and the filing of Cheal's brief on appeal (from June 27 to December 12, 2003), Cheal's brief does not contain even a bare-bones assertion that she disputes anything in the restitution order.

Under these circumstances, despite the regrettable problems with notice of the proposed restitution order, we must reject her due process claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, we must add an explanatory note about future cases, like this one, involving deferred restitution orders at the time that a defendant files a notice of appeal from the entry of judgment. There might be a question whether the judgment of conviction entered on February 25, 2003, which imposed Cheal's sentence but only ordered restitution in general terms, was a final judgment that triggered the running of the appeal period. Arguably, the judgment was not truly final until June 27, 2003, when the district court issued an Amended Judgment and Order requiring Cheal to make restitution in the amounts and to the victims specified in the government's list. Despite these plausible arguments, we must treat the February judgment as final and appealable because of a statutory provision in the MVRA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 3664(<i>o</i>) provides: \"A sentence that imposes an order of restitution is a final judgment notwithstanding the fact that such a sentence can subsequently be corrected ...; appealed and modified...; amended under subsection (d)(5); or adjusted....\" As we have already mentioned, subsection (d)(5) addresses itself to two situations that may require changes to a restitution order. First, where the victim's losses cannot be determined before sentencing, it provides an extra 90 days for a \"final determination.\" Second, where the \"final determination\" has failed to account for some victims who did not discover their losses until later, subsection (d)(5) provides such victims \"60 days after discovery of those losses in which to petition the court for an amended restitution order.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3664(d)(5). Section 3664(<i>o</i>)'s instruction, then, to disregard for purposes of finality restitution orders \"<i>amended</i> under subsection (d)(5)\" could be read narrowly as encompassing only the second situation, which specifically provides for \"an <i>amended</i> restitution order.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, we decline to read &#167; 3664(<i>o</i>) so narrowly. The provision states that courts should treat a \"sentence that imposes an order of restitution\" as final, notwithstanding the possibility of subsequent modification. In Cheal's case, the February judgment imposed a restitution obligation. The court stated in the judgment: \"The defendant shall pay the balance of the restitution according to a court-ordered repayment schedule.\" Although the specific amounts of restitution and the list of victims were yet to be determined, an \"order of restitution\" (the phrase used in &#167; 3664(<i>o</i>)) had been entered. Sensibly and properly, the court advised Cheal of her right to appeal from the sentence that it had just imposed: \"You are advised, Ms. Cheal, that you have the right [to] appeal from the sentence by filing a notice of appeal. I ask Mr. Murray to talk with you about this and file such a notice within ten days if you decide to appeal.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A contrary rule &#8212; one that linked the finality of the judgment of conviction to a later restitution order that included specific amounts and victims &#8212; would have troubling consequences for defendants, who have an obvious and legitimate interest in pursuing a timely appeal. This interest would be compromised if the judgment of conviction were not final until the final restitution determination was reflected in an order of the court. Indeed, a defendant could already be incarcerated without the ability to pursue an appeal until the specifics of restitution are later determined. For these reasons of statutory language and policy, we conclude that the February judgment was one that \"impose[d] an order of restitution\" on Cheal within the meaning of &#167; 3664(<i>o</i>) and was final and appealable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, this conclusion raises a question as to whether Cheal's notice of appeal from the February judgment, filed <i>pro se</i> on March 4, 2003, served to bring before us the Amended Judgment and Order of June 27, 2003, which specified the restitution amounts owed to identified victims. Fed. R.App. P. 3(c)(1)(B) provides that the notice of appeal must \"designate the judgment, order, or part thereof being appealed.\" The defendant must file the notice of appeal within ten days after the entry of judgment or the order being appealed. <i>See</i> Fed. R.App. P. 4(b). Typically, these rules prevent a court of appeals from considering any orders or judgments besides those designated in the appellant's notice of appeal. In the case of an amended judgment or a later order that is substantively different, an appellant may have to amend his notice of appeal or file a new one. \"The settled rule is that the non-substantive revision of a previously entered judgment does not restart or otherwise affect the period within which appellate review must be sought. It is only when the judgment-issuing court alters matters of substance or resolves some genuine ambiguity that the entry of an amended judgment winds the appeals clock anew.\" <i>Air Line Pilots Ass'n v.

We agree with these courts, although we note that, elsewhere, &#167; 3664 does distinguish between the determination and the order. <i>See</i> &#167;&#167; 3664(f)(1)(A) (\"In each order of restitution, the court shall order restitution to each victim in the full amount of each victim's losses as determined by the court....\") and 3664(f)(2) (\"Upon determination of the amount of restitution owed to each victim, the court shall ... specify in the restitution order the manner in which, and the schedule according to which, the restitution is to be paid....\").</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Second, &#167; 3664(d)(5) keys its time periods to \"sentencing\" &#8212; \"10 days prior to sentencing,\" \"90 days after sentencing\" &#8212; but does not specify whether this term refers to the sentencing hearing or to the district court's actual entry of judgment. We conclude that \"sentencing\" in this provision refers to the sentencing hearing for four reasons. First, we read this provision in conjunction with &#167; 3664(d)(1), which requires the government to provide the probation officer with a listing of the amounts subject to restitution \"not later than 60 days prior to the date initially set for sentencing.\" It makes more sense to speak of the district court setting a date for the sentencing hearing, rather than for entry of judgment, which is not usually done on some preset date. Second, because of the usual uncertainty about precisely when a district court plans to enter judgment, it would be difficult to calculate the date that would fall \"10 days prior to sentencing\" as provided by &#167; 3664(d)(5) (which provides that \"[i]f the victim's losses are not ascertainable by the date that is 10 days prior to sentencing, the attorney for the Government or the probation officer shall so inform the court.\") Third, our interpretation is more consistent with the language of Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i), titled \"Sentencing,\" which begins: \"At sentencing,\" and goes on to refer to the sentencing hearing. Fourth, keying this 10-day deadline to the sentencing hearing gives better expression to a Congressional intent to allow the defendant to develop objections to the government's data in time to present them at the sentencing hearing.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> <i>See United States v.

Were we to read it as terminating a court's jurisdiction 90 days after a sentencing hearing, we would be effectively nullifying its provision that a victim may petition the court for an amended restitution order 60 days after the discovery of any additional losses. The MVRA permits amendments to restitution orders to reflect changed circumstances, and neither confers nor terminates a court's jurisdiction.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">201 F.3d at 814 (citation omitted). A year later, however, <i>United States v. Jolivette,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774054\"><a href=\"/opinion/774054/united-states-v-fabien-miguel-jolivette/\"><span class=\"volume\">257</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">581</span></a></span> (6th Cir.2001), came to a different and seemingly irreconcilable conclusion: \"We believe that [the MVRA] makes clear the congressional intent to prohibit courts from making restitution determinations after the statutory period has run.... [W]e hold that when the 90-day clock runs out, the judgment of conviction and sentence, including the restitution provision, becomes final by operation of the statute.\" <i>Jolivette,</i> 257 F.3d at 584. Strangely, <i>Jolivette</i> did not cite <i>Vandeberg</i> or refer to it in any way. As noted, we reject <i>Jolivette</i>'s jurisdictional view of &#167; 3664.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> The conference managers of the final version of AEDPA directed that S. Rep. 104-179 \"should serve as the legislative history for [the MVRA].\" H.R. Conf. Rep. 104-518, at 112 (1996),<i>reprinted in</i> 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 944, 945. At the time of S. Rep. 104-179, the text that would become 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3664(d)(5) was in substantially final form and included the 90-day period.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn17\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17_ref\">17</a>\n        <p> The committee also noted its desire \"that defendants not be able to fraudulently transfer assets that might be available for restitution,\"<i>id.,</i> although it did not tie this concern specifically to the 90-day rule.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> It is also important to understand the difficult circumstances confronting the district court and the government in a case such as this. In truth, &#167; 3664's one-size-fits-all 90-day deadline seems poorly suited for complex cases involving thousands of victims and millions of dollars in losses. Other courts of appeals have offered advice on how to comply with &#167; 3664's time limits and still render a complete and accurate accounting of the defendant's misconduct. The Eleventh Circuit, for example, has suggested that if district courts foresee a problem with getting the restitution order entered within 90 days of sentencing, they \"can postpone sentencing and thereby put off the start of the 90-day period.\"<i>United States v. Maung,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"75621\"><a href=\"/opinion/75621/united-states-v-myat-maung/\"><span class=\"volume\">267</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1113</span></a></span>, 1121 (11th Cir.2001).
