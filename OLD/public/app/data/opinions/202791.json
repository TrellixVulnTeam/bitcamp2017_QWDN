Cyr, with whom Law Offices of Anthony J. Sineni III,\nLLC, was on brief, for appellant.\n     Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, with whom Paula D.\nSilsby, United States Attorney, was on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          June 13, 2007\n\f          STAHL, Senior Circuit Judge.   Charles St. Pierre appeals\n\nthe denial by the United States District Court for the District of\n\nMaine of his motion to suppress evidence.   We affirm.\n\n          On February 17 and 24, 2005, government agents made two\n\ncontrolled purchases of crack cocaine from Elmer Larson.     At the\n\ntime of the second purchase, the agents provided Larson with $500\n\nin marked bills, which he then took to St. Pierre's apartment at\n\nthe Gray Terrace Apartments in Gray, Maine.    At 8:30 a.m. Larson\n\nreturned to the agents with 2.2 grams of crack cocaine.        After\n\ngiving the drugs to one of the government agents, Larson was\n\narrested and then quickly agreed to cooperate with the government.\n\nHe identified a resident of the Gray Terrace Apartments named\n\n\"Charlie\" as the person who had supplied him with the drugs.\n\n          That same morning, the agents fitted Larson with a\n\nlistening device and had him return to St. Pierre's apartment.\n\nAlthough Larson and St. Pierre had a discussion there, the agents\n\nwere unable to understand much of it over the device.    After a few\n\nminutes, Larson left the apartment and returned to the agents.   He\n\ntold them that St. Pierre had discussed doing a transaction later\n\nthat day, around 3:00 p.m.   Larson also told them that St. Pierre\n\nhad sent him out to fetch a soda and that St. Pierre had said that\n\nhe would give him \"a line\" when he returned.\n\n          With that knowledge, the agents faced a dilemma because\n\nthey were unwilling to allow Larson to do drugs while cooperating\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fwith the government.    But Larson also told the agents that if he\n\ndid not return with the soda within a few minutes, St. Pierre might\n\nbecome suspicious. The agents on the scene considered applying for\n\na search warrant immediately, but decided that there was simply not\n\nenough time to wait for a warrant to be issued.   Concerned that St.\n\nPierre would soon become suspicious that something was amiss and\n\nthen destroy evidence, the agents decided to secure the apartment\n\nwithout a warrant.\n\n          At around noon, the agents knocked on the door and\n\nannounced their presence.    St. Pierre opened the door, wearing a\n\ntee-shirt and boxer shorts.     One agent grabbed him to make sure\n\nthat he was unarmed, and in the commotion St. Pierre and the agent\n\ntripped and fell backwards into the apartment.       St. Pierre was\n\nhandcuffed and, because his underpants were \"soiled,\" the agents\n\nretrieved a pair of pants off the floor and helped St. Pierre to\n\nput them on.   How those pants came to be on St. Pierre is the focal\n\npoint of his appeal, although the record is unclear whether they\n\nwere put on at the suggestion of St. Pierre or at the insistence of\n\nthe agents.\n\n          Because St. Pierre's girlfriend gave consent to search\n\nthe apartment, the agents did not seek a search warrant.     In the\n\nsearch that ensued, the agents discovered a quantity of drugs and\n\na large amount of U.S. currency.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f            St. Pierre was arrested and brought to the U.S. Marshal's\n\noffice in Portland, Maine, where, following standard procedure, he\n\nwas strip-searched before being put in a holding cell.              In his\n\npants pocket, the marshals discovered $380 of the marked $500 that\n\nthe agents had used to purchase drugs from Larson.          St. Pierre was\n\ncharged with three counts of distribution of cocaine base, in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. ยง 841(a)(1).\n\n            On May 3, 2005, St. Pierre filed a motion to suppress\n\n\"any and all evidence seized as a result of the warrantless search\n\nof Defendant's residence.\"       The government initially opposed the\n\nmotion, but withdrew its opposition on July 1, and the motion was\n\ngranted on July 5.1         A dispute later arose as to whether the\n\nsuppression motion also covered the money that was found in St.\n\nPierre's pants at the time of his booking.\n\n            On August 16, the court allowed the defendant's original\n\nsuppression motion to be orally amended to include the $380 found\n\nin St. Pierre's pants at his booking, and a hearing on that issue\n\nfollowed.    On August 30, the district court denied the motion to\n\nsuppress with respect to the $380.        The trial proceeded, and the\n\njury found St. Pierre guilty of the two remaining counts.           He was\n\nsentenced    to   seventy    months'   imprisonment   and    five   years'\n\nsupervised release.    This timely appeal followed.\n\n\n\n     1\n      Following this, one of the three counts was dismissed, since\nit had been based on evidence seized during the warrantless search.\n\n                                   -4-\n\f           \"The district court's conclusions of fact are reviewed\n\nfor clear error, but we afford plenary review to the district\n\ncourt's   ultimate   conclusion   regarding   exigent   circumstances.\"\n\nUnited States v. Samboy, 433 F.3d 154, 158 (1st Cir. 2005).       \"'We\n\nwill uphold a denial of a motion to suppress if any reasonable view\n\nof the evidence supports it.'\" United States v. Kornegay, 410 F.3d\n\n89, 93 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting United States v. Mendez-de Jesus,\n\n85 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1996)).\n\n           \"[I]t is settled beyond peradventure that a search of an\n\nindividual's person made incident to a valid arrest is itself\n\nvalid, despite the absence of an arrest warrant.\" United States v.\n\nWinchenbach, 197 F.3d 548, 552 (1st Cir. 1999); accord United\n\nStates v. Robinson, 414 U.S. 218, 224 (1973).       For the arrest of\n\nSt. Pierre to be valid, the agents had to be both lawfully inside\n\nthe apartment and to have probable cause based on evidence other\n\nthan that found during the search.      Winchenbach, 197 F.3d at 554.\n\nThe parties do not dispute that probable cause existed as of the\n\ntime that Larson was arrested.      Therefore, we focus first on the\n\nissue of lawful entry.\n\n           \"[A] warrantless entry into a person's dwelling may be\n\npermitted if exigent circumstances arise.\" Samboy, 433 F.3d at 158\n\n(1st Cir. 2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).       Such exigent\n\ncircumstances arise when, inter alia, the police have a reasonable\n\nfear that a person would destroy drug evidence unless the person's\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fpremises are secured.     Illinois v. McArthur, 531 U.S. 326, 331-32\n\n(2001).   The district court found that the agents had a reasonable\n\nbelief that such exigent circumstances existed in this case,\n\nbecause Larson's failure to return could signal their presence to\n\nSt. Pierre.    See Samboy, 433 F.3d at 158-59 (courier's arrest and\n\nresultant failure to return to dealer can cause fear in police that\n\ndealer would be alerted to their investigation and would destroy\n\nevidence).    We agree.   Therefore, because the police were lawfully\n\nwithin the apartment and had probable cause to arrest St. Pierre,\n\nthe arrest was lawful.\n\n           The question that remains is whether the pants were\n\nproperly searched during the booking process.2         An \"inventory\n\nsearch\" of an arrestee's personal effects at a police station is\n\npermissible under the Fourth Amendment. Illinois v. Lafayette, 462\n\nU.S. 640, 648 (1983).       The Supreme Court has upheld inventory\n\nsearches of, e.g., an arrestee's shoulder bag, id., an impounded\n\n\n\n     2\n      The defendant argues that, even if the warrantless entry were\nlawful, the evidence in the pants should nonetheless be suppressed\nunder the original suppression order. However, he did not object\nto the oral amendment to his original suppression motion or to the\nsubsequent evidentiary hearing. Thus, by not objecting to treating\nthe $380 as outside of the original suppression motion and order,\nhe waived the argument that it was included. See United States v.\nJG-24, Inc., 478 F.3d 28, 32 (2007).      Therefore, we review the\nargument for plain error only, which requires that the defendant\ndemonstrate (1) an error (2) which was clear, (3) affected his\nsubstantial rights, and (4) seriously impaired the fairness or\nintegrity of the proceeding. Id.; see United States v. Olano, 507\nU.S. 725, 731-32 (1993). We find no such error here, in large part\nbecause there was other substantial evidence of guilt.\n\n                                  -6-\n\fcar's glove compartment, South Dakota v. Opperman, 428 U.S. 364,\n\n376 (1976), and a backpack found in an impounded car, Colorado v.\n\nBertine, 479 U.S. 367, 375 (1987).            In those cases, the key facts\n\nwere that the police \"were following standardized procedures\" and\n\nwere not \"act[ing] in bad faith or for the sole purpose of\n\ninvestigation.\"     Id.    at   372.     Such    searches    were   considered\n\n\"reasonable\" under the Fourth Amendment, regardless of whether\n\nthere was probable cause or the police had a warrant, because the\n\nprocedures were developed for independent reasons, such as the\n\nsafety of the officers or the protection of an owner's property\n\nwhile in the custody of the police.             Id.    That reasoning would\n\nbreak   down,   however,   if   the    procedures     were   manipulated   for\n\ninvestigatory purposes.\n\n           Therefore, the circumstances by which the pants came to\n\nbe on St. Pierre are important.              If it were the case that the\n\npolice, knowing that the evidence found in the apartment search was\n\nlikely to be suppressed, conspired to stash the $380 in the pocket\n\nof a pair of pants and then coerce St. Pierre into wearing them,\n\nthis would be a very different case.          Here, however, St. Pierre has\n\nnot alleged any bad faith by the agents, nor is there any evidence\n\nof such.    Furthermore, having the consent of the girlfriend to\n\nsearch the apartment, the agents had no reason to believe that the\n\nevidence they discovered would be suppressed.            Finally, given St.\n\nPierre's condition, it was entirely reasonable for all parties,\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fhimself included, to want him to be given pants, and there is no\n\nevidence that he protested or asked for a different pair of pants.\n\nThus, under these somewhat unusual circumstances, a search of St.\n\nPierre's pants at booking was proper, and we see no error in the\n\ndenial of the motion to suppress the $380.3\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      The government argues implicitly that St. Pierre's tacit\nconsent to wearing the pants is equivalent to an arrestee's consent\nto a warrantless search.      We do not decide that issue here,\nhowever, since the question of consent to a search is problematic\nwhen (a) St. Pierre consented only to wearing pants, and (b) the\nability to give consent to a warrantless search is questionable\nunder these sorts of circumstances. See Schneckloth v. Bustamonte,\n412 U.S. 218, 222 (1973); United States v. Twomey, 884 F.2d 46, 51\n(1st Cir. 1989). Our decision is based instead on the fact that\nSt. Pierre consented to wearing pants in a situation where wearing\npants was eminently reasonable and no police bad faith was alleged,\nand that such pants were then reasonably searched at booking\npursuant to an inventory search policy.\n\n                               -8-\n\f",

At the time of the second purchase, the agents provided Larson with $500 in marked bills, which he then took to St. Pierre's apartment at the Gray Terrace Apartments in Gray, Maine. At 8:30 a.m. Larson returned to the agents with 2.2 grams of crack cocaine. After giving the drugs to one of the government agents, Larson was arrested and then quickly agreed to cooperate with the government. He identified a resident of the Gray Terrace Apartments named \"Charlie\" as the person who had supplied him with the drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That same morning, the agents fitted Larson with a listening device and had him return to St. Pierre's apartment. Although Larson and St. Pierre had a discussion there, the agents were unable to understand much of it over the device. After a few minutes, Larson left the apartment and returned to the agents. He told them that St. Pierre had discussed doing a transaction later that day, around 3:00 p.m. Larson also told them that St. Pierre had sent him out to fetch a soda and that St. Pierre had said that he would give him \"a line\" when he returned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With that knowledge, the agents faced a dilemma because they were unwilling to allow Larson to do drugs while cooperating with the government. But Larson also told the agents that if he did not return with the soda within a few minutes, St. Pierre might become suspicious. The agents on the scene considered applying for a search warrant immediately, but decided that there was simply not enough time to wait for a warrant to be issued. Concerned that St. Pierre would soon become suspicious that something was amiss and then destroy evidence, the agents decided to secure the apartment without a warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At around noon, the agents knocked on the door and announced their presence. St. Pierre opened the door, wearing a tee-shirt and boxer shorts. One agent grabbed him to make sure that he was unarmed, and in the commotion St. Pierre and the agent tripped and fell backwards into the apartment. St. Pierre was handcuffed and, because his underpants were \"soiled,\" the agents retrieved a pair of pants off the floor and helped St. Pierre to put them on. How those pants came to be on St. Pierre is the focal point of his appeal, although the record is unclear whether they were put on at the suggestion of St. Pierre or at the insistence of the agents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because St. Pierre's girlfriend gave consent to search the apartment, the agents did not seek a search warrant.

In his pants pocket, the marshals discovered $380 of the marked $500 that the agents had used to purchase drugs from Larson. St. Pierre was charged with three counts of distribution of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 3, 2005, St. Pierre filed a motion to suppress \"any and all evidence seized as a result of the warrantless search of Defendant's residence.\" The government initially opposed the motion, but withdrew its opposition on July 1, and the motion was granted on July 5.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> A dispute later arose as to whether the suppression motion also covered the money that was found in St. Pierre's pants at the time of his booking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 16, the court allowed the defendant's original suppression motion to be orally amended to include the $380 found in St. Pierre's pants at his booking, and a hearing on that issue followed. On August 30, the district court denied the motion to suppress with respect to the $380. The trial proceeded, and the jury found St. Pierre guilty of the two remaining counts.

For the arrest of St. Pierre to be valid, the agents had to be both lawfully inside the apartment and to have probable cause based on evidence other than that found during the search. <i>Winchenbach,</i> 197 F.3d at 554.
