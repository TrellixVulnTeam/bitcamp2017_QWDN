Pileggi and Roy, Beardsley, Williams & Granger, LLC were\non brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n                        December 17, 2002\n\f          BOUDIN, Chief Judge. The main question on this appeal is\n\nwhether the case in the district court was properly dismissed as\n\nmoot after the challenged conduct ceased or was undone.        The\n\nplaintiff-appellants are 551 employees of Great Northern Paper,\n\nInc. (\"Great Northern\"); the principal defendants are Bowater\n\nIncorporated (\"Bowater\") and the pension plan administered by\n\nBowater for its own employees and those of Great Northern.\n\n          The background facts are undisputed.     In August 1999,\n\nGreat Northern, until then a subsidiary of Bowater, was sold in a\n\nshare sale to a third party. Bowater, however, retained the assets\n\nand responsibilities of the pension plan that covered both Bowater\n\nand Great Northern employees. In the same month, Bowater announced\n\nthat it would amend the plan to cut back certain early retirement\n\nbenefits that the plan offered to Great Northern employees.    The\n\nplan was so amended in October retroactive to August 13.\n\n          In brief, the plan prior to August 1999 had allowed\n\nemployees with extensive service at Great Northern to opt for early\n\nretirement and yet receive pensions as if they had retired at\n\nordinary retirement age or, in other cases, with something less\n\nthan the usual discount in benefits for early retirement.      For\n\nexample, an employee who had worked 30 years could retire at age 60\n\nand receive the same benefits as if he had worked to 65.        In\n\neffect, Bowater's amendment meant that future work by employees at\n\n\n\n                               -2-\n\fGreat Northern, now no longer a Bowater subsidiary, would not count\n\nfor purposes of early retirement.\n\n          Whether and to what extent an employer can cut back on\n\nsuch benefits for employees who have not yet retired is governed by\n\nprovisions of ERISA--in particular, by section 204(g), 29 U.S.C. ยง\n\n1054(g) (2000).   For present purposes, the details of the statute\n\nand its application here are unimportant; it is enough to say that\n\nBowater maintained that its cut-back was lawful and that the\n\nemployees took the opposite position. In January 2000, the Bowater\n\nemployees brought the present action in federal district court\n\nunder ERISA against Bowater and the plan.\n\n          The main count of the complaint (count I) sought a\n\ndeclaration that the plan amendment violated section 204(g) and an\n\norder requiring the defendants to delete the amendment.       Other\n\ncounts (counts II and III) sought further relief for ten of the\n\nplaintiffs who said that they had relied on Bowater's statements\n\nabout the amendment and advice to individual employees; the ten\n\nplaintiffs said that as a result they had accepted lump sum\n\npayments, surrendering their rights to the greater benefits    that\n\nwould have been available to them under the original plan.\n\n          At this point, Bowater began to retreat but reluctantly.\n\nIn March 2000, Bowater, as plan administrator, sent a letter saying\n\nthat work done by Great Northern employees would continue to be\n\ncredited toward early retirement; the letter did not explain how\n\n\n                               -3-\n\fthis could be reconciled with the plan amendment.            In the same\n\nmonth Bowater filed its answer to the complaint which continued to\n\ndeny that the plan amendment was unlawful.             In April, Bowater\n\namended the plan to conform to the letter, but it declined to enter\n\ninto a consent decree conceding that the original amendment was\n\nunlawful or promising not to adopt the same amendment in the\n\nfuture.\n\n          Count I was referred to a magistrate judge and, based on\n\nher recommendation, the district court ruled in September 2000 that\n\ncount I was moot.   Litigation on counts II and III continued until,\n\nin October 2000, Bowater posed a notice agreeing to allow full\n\nbenefits under the original plan to those who had taken a lump sum\n\npayment in exchange for surrendering their right to full benefits.\n\nIn June 2001, Bowater amended the plan to conform to this promise\n\nof full benefits. Thereafter, the district court ruled that counts\n\nII and III were moot.\n\n          The   plaintiffs   have    now   appealed,    challenging   the\n\nmootness rulings.    In substance, they say that Bowater has never\n\nconceded that its original amendment was unlawful and, absent a\n\ndecree, Bowater remains free to reinstitute that amendment in the\n\nfuture.   A claim to attorney's fees, which ERISA permits, would\n\nalso be strengthened by such a decree, although this is not a basis\n\nfor litigating a case that is otherwise moot.          See Friends of the\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fEarth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtrl. Servs., Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 192 n.5\n\n(2000).   The issue is quite close.\n\n              Where during litigation a defendant ceases to engage in\n\nchallenged conduct and restores the status quo ante,                 the lawsuit\n\nmay or may not be moot.          The Supreme Court has said that such a\n\ncase is moot only if the defendant meets his \"heavy burden\" of\n\npersuading     the   court     that   it   is   \"absolutely    clear      that   the\n\nallegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to\n\nrecur.\"   See Friends of the Earth, Inc., 528 U.S. at 189 (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Concentrated Phospate Export Ass'n., 393 U.S. 199,\n\n203 (1968)); accord Nunez-Soto v. Avarado, 956 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.\n\n1992).    Here, the district court determined that any threat that\n\nthe amendment would be introduced was \"speculative\" and that the\n\ndefendants'      behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.\n\n              At first blush, this might appear to be a factual finding\n\nentitled to respect unless clearly erroneous. See Vinick v. United\n\nStates, 205 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2000).              However, no evidence was\n\npresented as to the likelihood that Bowater will reintroduce its\n\noriginal amendment; and, where the district court applies an\n\nabstract standard to known facts, the extent of deference accorded\n\non   review    varies   from    substantial     deference     to   none    at    all,\n\ndepending on the subject matter and on other circumstances.                     In re\n\nExtradition of Howard, 996 F.2d 1320, 1327-28 (1st Cir. 1993).                    In\n\nmootness matters, reviewing courts tend to exercise their own\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fjudgment, see, e.g., Verhoeven v. Brunswick Sch. Comm., 207 F.3d 1,\n\n5 (1st Cir. 1999), and both sides agree that our review here is de\n\nnovo.\n\n            Bowater     controls    the    information    about        its    own\n\nintentions and has made no declaration as to any firm plan.                  This\n\ngap in information might be weighed against Bowater (cf. Friends of\n\nthe Earth, Inc., 528 U.S. at 189 (\"defendant's heavy burden\")), but\n\nwe prefer to rest our decision on          somewhat different grounds.\n\nAfter all, Bowater could plausibly say that it has no plans one way\n\nor the other and thus nothing more to disclose.               Still, on this\n\nrecord Bowater cannot say that it has affirmatively ruled out the\n\npossibility of reintroducing the amendment.\n\n          The Supreme Court's primary test--\"reasonably be expected\n\nto recur\"--suggests an estimate of raw probabilities.              At either\n\nend of the spectrum, this is probably the intended approach.                   If\n\nthere is a high likelihood of recurrence, the case should not be\n\ndeemed moot; if very low, mootness ought to follow.               But in the\n\nmiddle ground, we doubt that the Supreme Court meant woodenly to\n\nexclude   all   other    factors,    including     equitable      or         other\n\nconsiderations,   bearing   on   whether    a   case   that    began    with    a\n\nconcrete controversy should be dismissed when the conduct ceases;\n\nits own case law suggests that other concerns can play a role.1\n\n\n     1\n      Bd. of Educ. of Hendrick Hudson Cent. Sch. Dist. v. Rowley,\n458 U.S. 176, 186 n.9 (1982) (mootness inappropriate where alleged\nwrong was \"capable of repetition without review\"); Adarand\n\n                                    -6-\n\f           Here, the likelihood of recurrence being very hard to\n\nestimate, several such considerations work in favor of litigating\n\nthis case to judgment. One--a predicate point but not the decisive\n\nconsideration--is that Bowater has been persistently unwilling\n\neither to admit that its amendment was unlawful or to say that it\n\nwill not be reintroduced.         This refusal may make sense as a\n\nmanagement decision to preserve all options--after all, the ERISA\n\nprecedents may develop in Bowater's favor--but it suggests that the\n\npossibility of recurrence is not wholly fanciful.\n\n           Of course, if the risk were merely that the company would\n\nchange position next month, it might still appear to be extremely\n\nlow and easy to brush aside.       But this case concerns retirement\n\nbenefits that are earned over a substantial period and can affect\n\npay-outs that may occur many years into the future.          The ability of\n\nworkers to plan their careers, and their savings, is impaired by\n\nuncertainties as to what Bowater might do three, five, or even ten\n\nyears from now.      Further, the withdrawal of the amendment is not\n\nlike the abandonment of plans to build a bridge or a dam:               the\n\namendment could be reintroduced without cost to Bowater at a\n\nmoment's   notice;    again,   imagine   that   a   couple   of   favorable\n\nappellate decisions come down the pike next year.\n\n\nConstructors, Inc. v. Slater, 528 U.S. 216, 224 (2000) (signaling\nreluctance to moot a case \"that has been litigated up to this Court\nand back down again\"); Friends of the Earth, Inc., 528 U.S. at 191-\n92 & n.5 (noting that sunk costs to the judicial system counsel\nagainst finding mootness)\n\n                                   -7-\n\f           Some uncertainties cannot be avoided.                     All kinds of\n\nthreats to expected pensions can develop and expectations can often\n\nbe disappointed.     But here a specific threat has been posed and a\n\nsubstantial investment in litigation costs has been made to obtain\n\nan answer to it; plaintiffs had already briefed their summary\n\njudgment motion on the merits when count I was dismissed.                   All that\n\nplaintiffs have asked is the chance to put the matter completely to\n\nrest.\n\n           Finally, Bowater could easily             have     said on the record\n\nthat it would not in the future reintroduce for Great Northern\n\nworkers the substance of the challenged amendment.                       If this had\n\nbeen done without hesitation in the district court, this almost\n\ncertainly would have persuaded us that the quarrel was moot.                    Yet,\n\neven at oral argument on this appeal, Bowater's counsel said he\n\ncould not give such a commitment to the plaintiffs.\n\n           The   plaintiffs       have    relied    heavily       upon   Walling   v.\n\nHelmerich & Payne, Inc., 323 U.S. 37 (1944).                  There, the Supreme\n\nCourt refused to declare moot a wage and hours enforcement case\n\nwhere the defendant had latterly altered his wage schedule to\n\nconform   to   the   law;   the    Court       observed    that    defendant    \"has\n\nconsistently urged the validity of the [original schedule] and\n\nwould presumably be free to resume this illegal plan were not some\n\neffective restraint made.\"           Id. at 43.           The Supreme Court has\n\nrarely referred to this language again, although lower courts have\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\foften relied upon Walling.        See, e.g., Donovan v. Cunningham, 716\n\nF.2d 1455, 1461-62 (5th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 467 U.S. 1251\n\n(1984).      See also 13A Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and\n\nProcedure ยง 3533.5, at 326-28 & n.11 (2d ed. 1984).\n\n             In our view, Walling--although atmospherically helpful to\n\nplaintiffs--should not be read mechanically to require a defendant\n\nalways to denounce his own conduct.           Mootness turns primarily on\n\nfuture threats, not upon penance. Other concerns (e.g., publicity,\n\nconcern about attorney's fees), or perhaps mere stubbornness, may\n\ncause a retreating defendant to maintain that his now abandoned\n\nposition was lawful.       But where a defendant is unwilling to give\n\nany assurance that the conduct will not be repeated, a natural\n\nsuspicion is provoked that recurrence may well be a realistic\n\npossibility.\n\n             Just how possible depends very much on the circumstances.\n\nHere, the circumstances bring this case into a middle ground where\n\nrecurrence    is   certainly    more   than   a   theoretical    possibility;\n\ndepending    on    how   case   law   develops,   it   could    easily    be   in\n\ndefendants' interest to try to reinstate the amendment.                  In this\n\nsituation, the prudential factors that tip the balance against\n\nmootness have been candidly set forth.            Thus, in our view count I\n\nis not moot.\n\n             As to counts II and III, the ten plaintiffs separately\n\nnamed in those counts appear to be in the same position as all of\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fthe hundreds of other employees with this exception:                       the ten say\n\nthat    not   only   did    the   now   rescinded      amendment      reduce      their\n\nprospective benefits but, in addition, they relied on the change to\n\nelect a less favorable retirement option.                    When the defendants\n\nwithdrew the amendment, they also allowed the employees to undo\n\ntheir   misguided     elections     and   restored         the    status    quo   ante.\n\nWhether any of the ten plaintiffs is now retired is unclear, but\n\nthere is no indication that the ten have any current grievance.\n\n              Obviously the ten employees in counts II and III have the\n\nsame interest as all others in assuring that the original plan\n\namendment is not reinstated, but whether there is anything else\n\nleft for them to litigate is not apparent.                        It seems scarcely\n\nconceivable that the defendants, having allowed the elections to be\n\nwithdrawn, would ever argue that the elections were still valid and\n\nbinding.      In any event, it is hard to tell from the filings below\n\nor the briefs on appeal whether there is anything live about counts\n\nII and III except so far as the plaintiffs there seek the same\n\ndeclaration as the plaintiffs in count I.                  This, we think, can be\n\nsorted out on remand.\n\n              On remand, we do not foreclose the possibility that\n\ndefendants     can   make   commitments        so   firm    and    effective      as   to\n\npreclude the need for litigation.                   Whether the plaintiffs can\n\nrecover attorney's fees does not necessarily depend on whether a\n\nformal judgment has been entered.          The Supreme Court did require a\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fjudgment under one statute, Buckhannon Bd. & Care Home, Inc. v. W.\n\nVa. Dep't of Health & Human Res., 532 U.S. 598, 600 (2001), but the\n\nERISA statute is differently phrased and conceivably the result\n\ncould be different.\n\n            Accordingly, we vacate the judgment dismissing the case\n\nas moot and remand for further proceedings consistent with this\n\ndecision.\n\n            It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\f",

A claim to attorney's fees, which ERISA permits, would also be strengthened by such a decree, although this is not a basis for litigating a case that is otherwise moot. <i>See Friends of the Earth, Inc. v.

In mootness matters, reviewing courts tend to exercise their own judgment, <i>see, e.g., Verhoeven v. Brunswick Sch.

This gap in information might be weighed against Bowater (<i>cf. Friends of the Earth, Inc.,</i> 528 U.S. at 189, 120 S.Ct. 693 (\"defendant's heavy burden\")), but we prefer to rest our decision on somewhat different grounds. After all, Bowater could plausibly say that it has <i>no</i> plans one way or the other and thus nothing more to disclose. Still, on this record Bowater cannot say that it has affirmatively ruled out the possibility of reintroducing the amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court's primary test&#8212; \"reasonably be expected to recur\" &#8212; suggests an estimate of raw probabilities. At either end of the spectrum, this is probably the intended approach. If there is a high likelihood of recurrence, the case should not be deemed moot; if very low, mootness ought to follow. But in the middle ground, we doubt that the Supreme Court meant woodenly to exclude all other factors, including equitable or other considerations, bearing on whether a case that began with a concrete controversy should be dismissed when the conduct ceases; its own case law suggests that other concerns can play a role.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the likelihood of recurrence being very hard to estimate, several such considerations work in favor of litigating this case to judgment. One &#8212; a predicate point but not the decisive consideration &#8212; is that Bowater has been persistently unwilling either to admit that its amendment was unlawful or to say that it will not be reintroduced. This refusal may make sense as a management decision to preserve all options &#8212; after all, the ERISA precedents may develop in Bowater's favor &#8212; but it suggests that the possibility of recurrence is not wholly fanciful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, if the risk were merely that the company would change position next month, it might still appear to be extremely low and easy to brush aside. But this case concerns retirement benefits that are earned over a substantial period and can affect pay-outs that may occur many years into the future. The ability of workers to plan their careers, and their savings, is impaired by uncertainties as to what Bowater might do three, five, or even ten years from now. Further, the withdrawal of the amendment is not like the abandonment of plans to build a bridge or a dam: the amendment could be reintroduced without cost to Bowater at a moment's notice; again, imagine that a couple of favorable appellate decisions come down the pike next year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some uncertainties cannot be avoided. All kinds of threats to expected pensions can develop and expectations can often be disappointed. But here a specific threat has been posed and a substantial investment in litigation costs has been made to obtain an answer to it; plaintiffs had already briefed their summary judgment motion on the merits when count I was dismissed. All that plaintiffs have asked is the chance to put the matter completely to rest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Bowater could easily have said on the record that it would not in the future reintroduce for Great Northern workers the substance of the challenged amendment. If this had been done without hesitation in the district court, this almost certainly would have persuaded us that the quarrel was moot. Yet, even at oral argument on this appeal, Bowater's counsel said he could not give such a commitment to the plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs have relied heavily upon <i>Walling v. Helmerich &amp; Payne, Inc.,</i> 323 U.S. 37, 65 S.Ct. 11, 89 L.Ed. 29 (1944). There, the Supreme Court refused to declare moot a wage and hours enforcement case where the defendant had latterly altered his wage schedule to conform to the law; the Court observed that defendant \"has consistently urged the validity of the [original schedule] and would presumably be free to resume this illegal plan were not some effective restraint made.\" <i>Id.</i> at 43, 65 S.Ct. 11. The Supreme Court has rarely referred to this language again, although lower courts have often relied upon Walling. <i>See, e.g., Donovan v. Cunningham,</i> 716 F.2d 1455, 1461-62 (5th Cir. 1983), <i>cert. denied,</i> 467 U.S. 1251, 104 S.Ct. 3533, 82 L.Ed.2d 839 (1984). <i>See also</i> 13A Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> &#167; 3533.5, at 326-28 &amp; n.11 (2d ed.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, <i>Walling</i>&#8212; although atmospherically helpful to plaintiffs &#8212; should not be read mechanically to require a defendant always to denounce his own conduct. Mootness turns primarily on future threats, not upon penance. Other concerns (<i>e.g.,</i> publicity, concern about attorney's fees), or perhaps mere stubbornness, may cause a retreating defendant to maintain that his now abandoned position was lawful. But where a defendant is unwilling to give any assurance that the conduct will not be repeated, a natural suspicion is provoked that recurrence may well be a realistic possibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Just <i>how</i> possible depends very much on the circumstances. Here, the circumstances bring this case into a middle ground where recurrence is certainly more than a theoretical possibility; depending on how case law develops, it could easily be in defendants' interest to try to reinstate the amendment. In this situation, the prudential factors that tip the balance against mootness have been candidly set forth. Thus, in our view count I is not moot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to counts II and III, the ten plaintiffs separately named in those counts appear to be in the same position as all of the hundreds of other employees with this exception: the ten say that not only did the now rescinded amendment reduce their prospective benefits but, in addition, they relied on the change to elect a less favorable retirement option. When the defendants withdrew the amendment, they also allowed the employees to undo their misguided elections and restored the <i>status quo ante.</i> Whether any of the ten plaintiffs is now retired is unclear, but there is no indication that the ten have any current grievance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Obviously the ten employees in counts II and III have the same interest as all others in assuring that the original plan amendment is not reinstated, but whether there is anything else left for them to litigate is not apparent. It seems scarcely conceivable that the defendants, having allowed the elections to be withdrawn, would ever argue that the elections were still valid and binding. In any event, it is hard to tell from the filings below or the briefs on appeal whether there is anything live about counts II and III except so far as the plaintiffs there seek the same declaration as the plaintiffs in count I. This, we think, can be sorted out on remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, we do not foreclose the possibility that defendants can make commitments so firm and effective as to preclude the need for litigation. Whether the plaintiffs can recover attorney's fees does not necessarily depend on whether a formal judgment has been entered. The Supreme Court did require a judgment under one statute, <i>Buckhannon Bd. &amp; Care Home, Inc. v. W. Va. Dep't of Health &amp; Human Res.,</i> 532 U.S. 598, 600, 121 S.Ct. 1835, 149 L.Ed.2d 855 (2001), but the ERISA statute is differently phrased and conceivably the result could be different.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we <i>vacate</i> the judgment dismissing the case as moot and <i>remand</i> for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>It is so ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> <i>Bd. of Educ. of Hendrick Hudson Cent.

The plaintiff-appellants are 551 employees of Great Northern Paper, Inc. (\"Great Northern\"); the principal defendants are Bowater Incorporated (\"Bowater\") and the pension plan administered by Bowater for its own employees and those of Great Northern.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The background facts are undisputed. In August 1999, Great Northern, until then a subsidiary of Bowater, was sold in a share sale to a third party. Bowater, however, retained the assets and responsibilities of the pension plan that covered both Bowater and Great Northern employees. In the same month, Bowater announced that it would amend the plan to cut back certain early retirement benefits that the plan offered to Great Northern employees. The plan was so amended in October retroactive to August 13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In brief, the plan prior to August 1999 had allowed employees with extensive service at Great Northern to opt for early retirement and yet receive pensions as if they had retired at ordinary retirement age or, in other cases, with something less than the usual discount in benefits for early retirement. For example, an employee who had worked 30 years could retire at age 60 and receive the same benefits as if he had worked to 65. In effect, Bowater's amendment meant that future work by employees at Great Northern, now no longer a Bowater subsidiary, would not count for purposes of early retirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether and to what extent an employer can cut back on such benefits for employees who have not yet retired is governed by provisions of ERISA &#8212; in particular, by section 204(g), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1054(g) (2000). For present purposes, the details of the statute and its application here are unimportant; it is enough to say that Bowater maintained that its cut-back was lawful and that the employees took the opposite position. In January 2000, the Bowater employees brought the present action in federal district court under ERISA against Bowater and the plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The main count of the complaint (count I) sought a declaration that the plan amendment violated section 204(g) and an order requiring the defendants to delete the amendment. Other counts (counts II and III) sought further relief for ten of the plaintiffs who said that they had relied on Bowater's statements about the amendment and advice to individual employees; the ten plaintiffs said that as a result they had accepted lump sum payments, surrendering their rights to the greater benefits that would have been available to them under the original plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this point, Bowater began to retreat but reluctantly. In March 2000, Bowater, as plan administrator, sent a letter saying that work done by Great Northern employees would continue to be credited toward early retirement; the letter did not explain how this could be reconciled with the plan amendment. In the same month Bowater filed its answer to the complaint which continued to deny that the plan amendment was unlawful. In April, Bowater amended the plan to conform to the letter, but it declined to enter into a consent decree conceding that the original amendment was unlawful or promising not to adopt the same amendment in the future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Count I was referred to a magistrate judge and, based on her recommendation, the district court ruled in September 2000 that count I was moot. Litigation on counts II and III continued until, in October 2000, Bowater posed a notice agreeing to allow full benefits under the original plan to those who had taken a lump sum payment in exchange for surrendering their right to full benefits. In June 2001, Bowater amended the plan to conform to this promise of full benefits. Thereafter, the district court ruled that counts II and III were moot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs have now appealed, challenging the mootness rulings. In substance, they say that Bowater has never conceded that its original amendment was unlawful and, absent a decree, Bowater remains free to reinstitute that amendment in the future. A claim to attorney's fees, which ERISA permits, would also be strengthened by such a decree, although this is not a basis for litigating a case that is otherwise moot. <i>See Friends of the Earth, Inc. v.

But here a specific threat has been posed and a substantial investment in litigation costs has been made to obtain an answer to it; plaintiffs had already briefed their summary judgment motion on the merits when count I was dismissed. All that plaintiffs have asked is the chance to put the matter completely to rest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Bowater could easily have said on the record that it would not in the future reintroduce for Great Northern workers the substance of the challenged amendment. If this had been done without hesitation in the district court, this almost certainly would have persuaded us that the quarrel was moot. Yet, even at oral argument on this appeal, Bowater's counsel said he could not give such a commitment to the plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs have relied heavily upon <i>Walling v. Helmerich &amp; Payne, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104022\"><a href=\"/opinion/104022/walling-v-helmerich-payne-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">323</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></span> (1944). There, the Supreme Court refused to declare moot a wage and hours enforcement case where the defendant had latterly altered his wage schedule to conform to the law; the Court observed that defendant \"has consistently urged the validity of the [original schedule] and would presumably be free to resume this illegal plan were not some effective restraint made.\" <i>Id.</i> at 43, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></span>. The Supreme Court has rarely referred to this language again, although lower courts have often relied upon Walling. <i>See, e.g., Donovan v. Cunningham,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">716</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1455</span></span>, 1461-62 (5th Cir. 1983), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1251</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">839</span></span> (1984). <i>See also</i> 13A Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> &#167; 3533.5, at 326-28 &amp; n.11 (2d ed.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, <i>Walling</i>&#8212; although atmospherically helpful to plaintiffs &#8212; should not be read mechanically to require a defendant always to denounce his own conduct. Mootness turns primarily on future threats, not upon penance. Other concerns (<i>e.g.,</i> publicity, concern about attorney's fees), or perhaps mere stubbornness, may cause a retreating defendant to maintain that his now abandoned position was lawful. But where a defendant is unwilling to give any assurance that the conduct will not be repeated, a natural suspicion is provoked that recurrence may well be a realistic possibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Just <i>how</i> possible depends very much on the circumstances. Here, the circumstances bring this case into a middle ground where recurrence is certainly more than a theoretical possibility; depending on how case law develops, it could easily be in defendants' interest to try to reinstate the amendment. In this situation, the prudential factors that tip the balance against mootness have been candidly set forth. Thus, in our view count I is not moot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to counts II and III, the ten plaintiffs separately named in those counts appear to be in the same position as all of the hundreds of other employees with this exception: the ten say that not only did the now rescinded amendment reduce their prospective benefits but, in addition, they relied on the change to elect a less favorable retirement option. When the defendants withdrew the amendment, they also allowed the employees to undo their misguided elections and restored the <i>status quo ante.</i> Whether any of the ten plaintiffs is now retired is unclear, but there is no indication that the ten have any current grievance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Obviously the ten employees in counts II and III have the same interest as all others in assuring that the original plan amendment is not reinstated, but whether there is anything else left for them to litigate is not apparent. It seems scarcely conceivable that the defendants, having allowed the elections to be withdrawn, would ever argue that the elections were still valid and binding. In any event, it is hard to tell from the filings below or the briefs on appeal whether there is anything live about counts II and III except so far as the plaintiffs there seek the same declaration as the plaintiffs in count I. This, we think, can be sorted out on remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, we do not foreclose the possibility that defendants can make commitments so firm and effective as to preclude the need for litigation. Whether the plaintiffs can recover attorney's fees does not necessarily depend on whether a formal judgment has been entered.
