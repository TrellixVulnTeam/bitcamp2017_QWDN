R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                         For the First Circuit\n\nNo. 03-2391\n\n                         RICHARD A. COLE, M.D.,\n\n                          Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                                       v.\n\n          CENTRAL STATES SOUTHEAST AND SOUTHWEST AREAS\n                     HEALTH AND WELFARE FUND,\n\n                          Defendant, Appellee.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                 FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n              [Hon. Mark L. Wolf,        U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                    Before\n\n                        Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                 Lipez and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n    Richard A. Cole on brief pro se.\n    Francis J. Carey on brief for appellant.\n\n\n\n                               June 15, 2004\n\f       Per Curiam. Pro se plaintiff-appellant Richard A. Cole, M.D.,\n\nchallenges the district court's grant of summary judgment to\n\ndefendant Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Health and\n\nWelfare Fund (\"Central States\") and denial of his claim under\n\nSection 502(a)(1)(B) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act\n\nof 1974, 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B), for nonpayment of benefits for\n\nmedical services    rendered   to   a     Plan   beneficiary.   We   affirm\n\nessentially for the reasons set forth in the district court's\n\nAugust 28, 2003, Memorandum and Order.           We add only that Cole has\n\nnot demonstrated that Central States' denial of his claim failed to\n\ncomply with ERISA's statutory and regulatory notice requirements,\n\n29 U.S.C. § 1133; 29 C.F.R. § 2560.503-1(f).\n\n       Cole argues that Central States' \"mantra\" of \"routine physical\n\nexamination\" was too conclusory to provide adequate notice of the\n\nreason for the denial to allow him to prepare for administrative\n\nreview, and he maintains that Central States should have given him\n\na line-by-line explanation for its denial of each charge. However,\n\nthis level of detail is not required by the statute or regulations.\n\nRather, the requirements are satisfied so long as the claimant is\n\n\"supplied with a statement of reasons that, under the circumstances\n\nof the case, permit[] a sufficiently clear understanding of the\n\nadministrator's position to permit effective review.\"           Halpin v.\n\nW.W. Grainger, Inc., 962 F.2d 685, 690 (7th Cir. 1992); see id. at\n\n689.    Central States' letters to Cole clearly indicate that his\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fclaim was denied because Central States' Medical Consultant found\n\nthe services for which Cole sought payment to be unnecessary and\n\nunrelated to the diagnosis he reported, and they were therefore\n\nexcluded. The plan excluded coverage for treatment that was either\n\nunnecessary or for routine physical examinations.              That was enough\n\nto   satisfy   the   statutory      and   regulatory     requirements.        See\n\nMilitello v. Central States, S.E. & S.W. Areas Pension Fund, 360\n\nF.3d 681, 689 (7th Cir. 2004) (\"Although the letter is sparse, the\n\nTrustees were required to give only specific reasons, not the\n\nreasoning behind the reasons\" (internal quotation marks omitted));\n\nGallo v. Amoco Corp., 102 F.3d 918, 923 (7th Cir. 1996) (\"All [the\n\nplan administrator] has to give the [claimant] is the reason for\n\nthe denial of benefits; he does not have to explain to him why it\n\nis a good reason\" (emphasis original)).\n\n      Cole's   argument    that     Central    States   violated     the   notice\n\nrequirements    because    it   did    not     inform   him   of   the   specific\n\ndocumentation or information needed to \"rehabilitate\" his claim is\n\nunavailing     because    Central     States    never   suggested    that    more\n\ninformation was needed to perfect the claim and allow for adequate\n\nreview.   See Terry v. Bayer Corp., 145 F.3d 28, 39 (1st Cir. 1998);\n\nEllis v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 126 F.3d 228, 236 (4th Cir.\n\n1997); Brehmer v. Inland Steel Indus. Pension Plan, 114 F.3d 656,\n\n661-62 (7th Cir. 1997). Central States did not reject Cole's claim\n\nas defective; it only found that his arguments did not refute the\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fopinion of its medical consultant.          It was also obvious from the\n\nalternative disposition of the February 27, 1991, bill as untimely\n\nsubmitted that, in order to successfully appeal that determination,\n\nCole   would   have   to    prove   that   he   submitted   it   within   the\n\nlimitations period.        His contention that he did not attempt to do\n\nso because the notices failed to advise exactly what he needed to\n\nproduce to prevail on appeal is not an adequate excuse.            The record\n\ndemonstrates that Cole received a full and fair administrative\n\nreview.\n\n       The judgment of the district court is affirmed.           See 1st Cir.\n\nLoc. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f",
