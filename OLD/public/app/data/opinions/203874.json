Juan Carlos Lasalle-Concepcion and Samuel\n\nAntonio Velez-Lugo both suffered work-related injuries during their\n\nservice as police officers with the Puerto Rico Police Department\n\n(\"the Department\").         Both received medical treatment for roughly\n\nsix months to a year during the period 1996-1998.                In 1999 the\n\nDepartment notified each of the men that his employment had been\n\nterminated because of his medical condition.\n\n            The officers then pursued administrative remedies and the\n\nBoard of Appeals of the Personnel System Administration (\"the\n\nBoard\") ruled in their favor.            The Department promptly sought\n\njudicial review, and the Puerto Rico Court of Appeals overturned\n\nthe Board, leaving the original terminations in force.              In 2001,\n\nthe Department's Medical Board certified each man as capable of\n\nreturning     to    work;   the   Department's   superintendent     requested\n\nreevaluation and in 2004 got the same result.\n\n            The two officers then filed this suit in federal district\n\ncourt, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988 (2000), against the\n\nPuerto   Rico      Police   Department   and   its   former   superintendent,\n\narguing inter alia that the failure to reinstate them as police\n\nofficers violated their due process rights under the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment.1        The district court dismissed the suit, holding that\n\n\n\n     1\n      Lasalle-Concepcion and Velez-Lugo were joined by their\nspouses as plaintiffs and also alleged civil rights violations\nunder the Fourth, Fifth, Ninth and Tenth Amendments, but then\ndeserted these claims in their opposition to the motion to dismiss.\n\n                                      -2-\n\fplaintiffs had no protected property interest in reinstatement\n\nunder Puerto Rico law.        The plaintiffs now appeal.\n\n            \"Under    the    Due   Process    Clause   of   the    Fourteenth\n\nAmendment, persons who possess a property interest in continued\n\npublic employment cannot be deprived of that interest without due\n\nprocess of law.\"      Figueroa-Serrano v. Ramos-Alverio, 221 F.3d 1, 5\n\n(1st Cir. 2000).       For this purpose, the Supreme Court looks to\n\nstate law to determine the existence and dimensions of such an\n\ninterest.    Bd. of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564,\n\n577 (1972).     Subtleties may exist but they are not presented in\n\nthis case.\n\n            The officers concede in their complaint that they were\n\npermissibly terminated in 1999, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 25, § 3117\n\n(2006), but they assert a property right and legal expectation\n\nunder   state   law     in    reinstatement    as   officers      once   their\n\ndisabilities were resolved and the Medical Board certified them as\n\ncapable of resuming their work.            Plaintiffs cite Article 18 of\n\nPuerto Rico Law 53 as the source of this purported property\n\ninterest.\n\n            By its terms, Article 18 does not impose upon the police\n\ndepartment any such         obligation.    It merely recognizes that the\n\npolice department has discretion to decide whether an officer\n\nshould be reinstated: \"Should the physical or mental disability\n\ndisappear, said member of the Force may be reinstated to service\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fupon certification of the Medical Evaluation Board.\"           P.R. Laws\n\nAnn.   tit.   25,   §   3117(b)(1)    (2006).   Whether   or    not   the\n\nsuperintendent proposed to defer to the Medical Board, the statute\n\ncreated no property right.\n\n          By contrast, another Puerto Rico statute does create a\n\nlimited right of reinstatement for an employee who recovers after\n\nsustaining an injury on the job.       Workmen's Accident Compensation\n\nAct, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 11, § 7 (2006) (\"[T]he employer shall be\n\nunder the obligation to reserve the job filled by the laborer or\n\nemployee at the time the accident occurred . . . .\").     The contrast\n\nwith Article 18's phrasing (\"may\" be reinstated) underscores the\n\nlack of an entitlement in Article 18.\n\n          The Workmen's Accident Compensation Act does not apply to\n\nthe officers in this case because it includes requirements as to\n\nthe timing of an application for reinstatement that were seemingly\n\nnot met and cannot be met now.         11 L.P.R.A. § 7;   Toro Cruz v.\n\nPolicia de Puerto Rico, 159 P.R. Dec. 339 (2003).     The details need\n\nnot be discussed because that statute has not been invoked by the\n\nofficers in this court.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f",
