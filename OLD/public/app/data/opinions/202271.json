George Z. Singal, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                      Selya, Lynch and Howard,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Robert M. Napolitano on brief for appellant.\n     Paula D. Silsby, United States Attorney, and Margaret D.\nMcGaughey, Appellate Chief, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                             June 22, 2006\n\f     Per    Curiam.   Easton   Wilson     pled   guilty   (without   a   plea\n\nagreement) to five counts charging, inter alia, conspiring to\n\nimport cocaine and to distribute cocaine base, and possession with\n\nintent to distribute cocaine base.          Two of the counts (Counts II\n\nand III) include references to drug quantities.           He was sentenced\n\nprior to the United States Supreme Court's decision in United\n\nStates v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005), but had raised in the\n\ndistrict court an objection to the federal sentencing guidelines\n\nbased on Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000).         Finding that\n\nthis had preserved a claim of Booker error and that the government\n\nhad failed to prove that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt, we affirmed the conviction but vacated the sentence and\n\nremanded    for   re-sentencing   under    Booker's   advisory   guidelines\n\nsystem.    See United States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 76 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).\n\n     On remand, the sentencing court reiterated its findings from\n\nthe original sentencing and imposed the identical sentence of 320\n\nmonths, at the middle of the applicable guideline sentencing\n\nrange.1    In this appeal, Wilson objects to the enhancements to his\n\nsentence based upon fact-finding by the sentencing court.            First,\n\nhe objects that the sentencing court's findings as to drug quantity\n\nenhanced his sentence for Counts I and III above the statutory\n\nmaximum, in violation of Apprendi.           Second, he argues that the\n\n\n     1\n       The court imposed a sentence of 320 months on each of Counts\nI, III and VI, and the statutory maximum of 240 months on Counts IV\nand V.\n\fsentencing court erred by enhancing his guideline sentence based on\n\njudicial findings of fact with respect to: drug quantity, role in\n\nthe offense, presence of a firearm, and attribution to him of prior\n\ncriminal conduct under the alias \"Anthony Brown,\" in violation of\n\nBlakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296 (2004).       Finally, Wilson\n\nchallenges his sentence under Booker, on the ground that it is\n\nbased upon an unreasonable assessment of the facts.        For the\n\nfollowing reasons, none of these sentencing challenges is availing.\n\n     I. Apprendi Claims\n     In Booker, the Court reaffirmed its holding in Apprendi:\n     Any fact (other than a prior conviction) which is\n     necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum\n     authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty\n     or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or\n     proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nUnited States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 244 (2005)(emphasis added).\n\nWilson's contention that the sentences imposed for Counts I and III\n\nexceeded the default statutory maximum imprisonment terms for those\n\noffenses is unfounded.   Count I charged conspiracy to distribute\n\n\"50 or more grams of cocaine base\" and Count III charged conspiracy\n\nto import \"5 or more kilograms of cocaine.\"     Wilson entered an\n\nunconditional plea to those charges and during the plea colloquy\n\nadmitted to the \"Prosecution Version\" of the facts, which included\n\nthe quantities charged in the indictment.    The maximum statutory\n\nimprisonment corresponding to those drug quantities is life. See 21\n\nU.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A)(iii) (Count I); id. § 960(b)(1)(B)(ii) (Count\n\nIII).   Therefore, the sentences imposed did not \"exceed[] the\n\n\n                               -3-\n\fmaximum authorized by the facts established by [Wilson's] plea of\n\nguilty,\" Booker, 543 U.S. at 244, and there was no Apprendi error.\n\n     II. Blakely Claims\n\n     Wilson argues that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated\n\nwhen the district court enhanced his guideline sentence based on\n\nthe following factual findings that were neither charged in the\n\nindictment nor proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt: 1)\n\ndefendant's role in the offense as an \"organizer or leader,\" 2) the\n\ndrug quantity used to arrive at a base offense level, 3) his\n\npossession of a dangerous weapon, and 4) attribution to defendant\n\nof prior criminal conduct committed under an alias.\n\n     Wilson    claims   that   such    judicial   fact-finding   violated\n\nBlakely.      \"Blakely claims are now viewed through the lens of\n\n[Booker].\"     Cirio-Muñoz v. United States, 404 F.3d 527, 532 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).     \"Under Booker, a judge may do such fact finding in\n\ndetermining the Guidelines range.           Nothing in Booker requires\n\nsubmission of such facts to a jury so long as the Guidelines are\n\nnot mandatory.\" Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 80; see United States\n\nv. Yeje-Cabrera, 430 F.3d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 2005).        Therefore, there\n\nwas no Blakely error in this case.\n\n     III. Booker Claim\n\n     Wilson claims his sentence is unreasonable because it is based\n\non clearly erroneous facts.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f       A. Drug Quantity\n\n       Wilson's main attack on the court's drug quantity finding is\n\nthat it includes \"estimates.\" The record supports the statement in\n\nthe    presentence   investigation     report    (PSR)   that   it   contains\n\n\"conservative estimate[s]\" of the amount of drugs attributable to\n\nWilson in this case.         As Wilson himself points out, where the\n\nreported information provided no reliable method to determine the\n\ndrug quantities involved, no quantity was attributed.            And where a\n\nreported amount seemed higher than would be consistent with other\n\ninformation obtained by the Probation Office, it was reduced\n\naccordingly.     These approaches support, rather than undercut, the\n\nPSR's drug quantity calculation that was adopted by the sentencing\n\ncourt. \"[S]uch a determination need not be exact, but, rather, may\n\nbe approximate, as long as the approximation represents a reasoned\n\nestimate.\" United States v. Santos, 357 F.3d 136, 141 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).   The sentencing court's factual finding as to drug quantity\n\nwas not clearly erroneous.\n\n       B. Role-in-the-Offense\n\n       The   district   court   applied    a   four-level   enhancement    to\n\nWilson's offense level based on a finding that Wilson was \"an\n\norganizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or\n\nmore    participants    or   was   otherwise    extensive.\"     U.S.S.G.    §\n\n3B1.1(a).     Wilson does not contest that there were five or more\n\nparticipants involved in the conspiracy. His only argument is that\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f\"[t]he other participants had their own agendas for their roles in\n\nthe schemes.     It is unfair to the Defendant and unreasonable to\n\nsuggest, but for [Wilson's] involvement these individuals would not\n\nhave formed a network.\"\n\n     The district court's finding that Wilson qualified as a leader\n\nor organizer is adequately supported. The \"Prosecution Version\" of\n\nthe facts, which was expressly accepted as true by Wilson at his\n\nguilty plea hearing,        described Wilson's specific recruitment of\n\naccomplices,     exercise    of    control     over      others,   and    use    of\n\ndecisionmaking authority.          Wilson has failed to demonstrate that\n\nthe four-level enhancement was based on a clearly erroneous factual\n\nassessment of his role in the offense. See United States v. Diaz-\n\nDiaz, 433 F.3d 128, 138-39 (1st Cir. 2005) (affirming four-level\n\nenhancement under clear error review where the evidence showed,\n\namong   other   things,     that   defendant    actively        recruited    other\n\nparticipants    and   instructed     others    as   to    the   best    route   for\n\ntransporting drugs).\n\n     C. Weapon\n\n     In calculating the guideline sentencing range, the district\n\ncourt applied a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(1),\n\nfor possession of a dangerous weapon.          The court adopted the PSR's\n\nfinding that \"a firearm was found in the defendant's bedroom during\n\nthe search conducted on April 12, 2003, in close proximity to a\n\nsignificant quantity of both cocaine base and cash.\"                   Wilson does\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fnot contest the accuracy of that finding.         Instead, he argues that\n\nthe government failed to point to any evidence of the use of a\n\nfirearm to advance any aspects of the drug trafficking.             However,\n\n\"[u]nder our case law there is no requirement that the weapon have\n\nbeen intended for use in perpetrating the drug offense, much less\n\nthat it have been used in furtherance of the offense.\"               United\n\nStates v. Castillo, 979 F.2d 8, 10 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n     D. Criminal History\n\n     On this appeal, Wilson's primary argument regarding criminal\n\nhistory is that the district court erred in relying upon reports in\n\nthe PSR of Wilson's arrest on charges that are pending, and for\n\nwhich he has not been convicted.       No criminal history points were\n\nassigned   to   the   pending   charges,   and   they   therefore   did   not\n\ninfluence the calculation of Wilson's criminal history category.\n\nHowever, Wilson argues that the district court improperly took\n\nthose pending charges into account when deciding where within the\n\nguideline range to sentence him.\n\n     At the original sentencing, the court made a reference to a\n\n1998 arrest of Wilson in England when discussing his prospects for\n\nrehabilitation.       The PSR reported that as of January 2004, those\n\ncharges (related to possession with intent to distribute cocaine\n\nbase and heroin) were \"pending\" and that a warrant had issued for\n\nfailure to appear for trial, but that extradition was not sought.\n\nSuch pending charges may be considered in deciding whether to make\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fan upward departure based on inadequacy of the criminal history\n\ncategory. See § U.S.S.G. § 4A1.3(a)(2)(E).                   It follows that the\n\ndistrict   court      did    not    err   in    considering    those     charges    in\n\ndetermining      where      to   sentence       Wilson   within    the   applicable\n\nguideline range.\n\n       Wilson also objects, as he did at sentencing, to the district\n\ncourt's use of his conviction for a 1992 offense committed under\n\nthe alias of Anthony Brown, for which he received one criminal\n\nhistory point.        In response to Wilson's objection to the PSR in\n\nthis regard, the Probation Office noted that the PSR reported with\n\nrespect    to    another     1992    Florida      conviction      that   Wilson    had\n\n\"acknowledged that he was using the license of Anthony Brown at\n\nthis   time.\"        At   the    original      sentencing,   the    district   court\n\nrecognized this as an area of dispute and made the following\n\nfinding:        \"I   find   based    on   the    contents    of    the   presentence\n\ninvestigation report that the criminal conduct described to his\n\na/k/a is properly his and in fact it occurred.\"                The district court\n\nreiterated those findings at the re-sentencing hearing. Wilson has\n\nfailed to demonstrate that such findings were clearly erroneous.\n\n       The district court articulated its reasons, addressed the\n\ndefendant's arguments, considered the relevant criteria and the\n\nsentence is entirely plausible. See United States v. Jimenez-\n\nBeltre, 440 F.3d 514, 519 (1st Cir. 2006)(en banc).                        Wilson's\n\nsentence is affirmed.\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\f",

Finally, Wilson\n\nchallenges his sentence under Booker, on the ground that it is\n\nbased upon an unreasonable assessment of the facts.        For the\n\nfollowing reasons, none of these sentencing challenges is availing.\n\n     I. Apprendi Claims\n     In Booker, the Court reaffirmed its holding in Apprendi:\n     Any fact (other than a prior conviction) which is\n     necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum\n     authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty\n     or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or\n     proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nUnited States v. Booker, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 244 (2005)(emphasis added).\n\nWilson's contention that the sentences imposed for Counts I and III\n\nexceeded the default statutory maximum imprisonment terms for those\n\noffenses is unfounded.   Count I charged conspiracy to distribute\n\n\"50 or more grams of cocaine base\" and Count III charged conspiracy\n\nto import \"5 or more kilograms of cocaine.\"     Wilson entered an\n\nunconditional plea to those charges and during the plea colloquy\n\nadmitted to the \"Prosecution Version\" of the facts, which included\n\nthe quantities charged in the indictment.

Therefore, the sentences imposed did not \"exceed[] the\n\n\n                               -3-\n\fmaximum authorized by the facts established by [Wilson's] plea of\n\nguilty,\" Booker, 543 U.S. at 244, and there was no Apprendi error.\n\n     II. Blakely Claims\n\n     Wilson argues that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated\n\nwhen the district court enhanced his guideline sentence based on\n\nthe following factual findings that were neither charged in the\n\nindictment nor proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt: 1)\n\ndefendant's role in the offense as an \"organizer or leader,\" 2) the\n\ndrug quantity used to arrive at a base offense level, 3) his\n\npossession of a dangerous weapon, and 4) attribution to defendant\n\nof prior criminal conduct committed under an alias.\n\n     Wilson    claims   that   such    judicial   fact-finding   violated\n\nBlakely.      \"Blakely claims are now viewed through the lens of\n\n[Booker].\"     Cirio-Muñoz v.

The sentencing court's factual finding as to drug quantity\n\nwas not clearly erroneous.\n\n       B. Role-in-the-Offense\n\n       The   district   court   applied    a   four-level   enhancement    to\n\nWilson's offense level based on a finding that Wilson was \"an\n\norganizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or\n\nmore    participants    or   was   otherwise    extensive.\"     U.S.S.G.    §\n\n3B1.1(a).     Wilson does not contest that there were five or more\n\nparticipants involved in the conspiracy. His only argument is that\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f\"[t]he other participants had their own agendas for their roles in\n\nthe schemes.     It is unfair to the Defendant and unreasonable to\n\nsuggest, but for [Wilson's] involvement these individuals would not\n\nhave formed a network.\"\n\n     The district court's finding that Wilson qualified as a leader\n\nor organizer is adequately supported. The \"Prosecution Version\" of\n\nthe facts, which was expressly accepted as true by Wilson at his\n\nguilty plea hearing,        described Wilson's specific recruitment of\n\naccomplices,     exercise    of    control     over      others,   and    use    of\n\ndecisionmaking authority.          Wilson has failed to demonstrate that\n\nthe four-level enhancement was based on a clearly erroneous factual\n\nassessment of his role in the offense. See United States v. Diaz-\n\nDiaz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201983\"><a href=\"/opinion/201983/united-states-v-diaz-diaz/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">128</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 138-39 (1st Cir. 2005) (affirming four-level\n\nenhancement under clear error review where the evidence showed,\n\namong   other   things,     that   defendant    actively        recruited    other\n\nparticipants    and   instructed     others    as   to    the   best    route   for\n\ntransporting drugs).\n\n     C. Weapon\n\n     In calculating the guideline sentencing range, the district\n\ncourt applied a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(1),\n\nfor possession of a dangerous weapon.          The court adopted the PSR's\n\nfinding that \"a firearm was found in the defendant's bedroom during\n\nthe search conducted on April 12, 2003, in close proximity to a\n\nsignificant quantity of both cocaine base and cash.\"                   Wilson does\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fnot contest the accuracy of that finding.         Instead, he argues that\n\nthe government failed to point to any evidence of the use of a\n\nfirearm to advance any aspects of the drug trafficking.             However,\n\n\"[u]nder our case law there is no requirement that the weapon have\n\nbeen intended for use in perpetrating the drug offense, much less\n\nthat it have been used in furtherance of the offense.\"               United\n\nStates v. Castillo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"594419\"><a href=\"/opinion/594419/united-states-v-milton-alcides-castillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">979</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 10 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n     D. Criminal History\n\n     On this appeal, Wilson's primary argument regarding criminal\n\nhistory is that the district court erred in relying upon reports in\n\nthe PSR of Wilson's arrest on charges that are pending, and for\n\nwhich he has not been convicted.       No criminal history points were\n\nassigned   to   the   pending   charges,   and   they   therefore   did   not\n\ninfluence the calculation of Wilson's criminal history category.\n\nHowever, Wilson argues that the district court improperly took\n\nthose pending charges into account when deciding where within the\n\nguideline range to sentence him.\n\n     At the original sentencing, the court made a reference to a\n\n1998 arrest of Wilson in England when discussing his prospects for\n\nrehabilitation.       The PSR reported that as of January 2004, those\n\ncharges (related to possession with intent to distribute cocaine\n\nbase and heroin) were \"pending\" and that a warrant had issued for\n\nfailure to appear for trial, but that extradition was not sought.\n\nSuch pending charges may be considered in deciding whether to make\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fan upward departure based on inadequacy of the criminal history\n\ncategory. See § U.S.S.G. § 4A1.3(a)(2)(E).                   It follows that the\n\ndistrict   court      did    not    err   in    considering    those     charges    in\n\ndetermining      where      to   sentence       Wilson   within    the   applicable\n\nguideline range.\n\n       Wilson also objects, as he did at sentencing, to the district\n\ncourt's use of his conviction for a 1992 offense committed under\n\nthe alias of Anthony Brown, for which he received one criminal\n\nhistory point.        In response to Wilson's objection to the PSR in\n\nthis regard, the Probation Office noted that the PSR reported with\n\nrespect    to    another     1992    Florida      conviction      that   Wilson    had\n\n\"acknowledged that he was using the license of Anthony Brown at\n\nthis   time.\"        At   the    original      sentencing,   the    district   court\n\nrecognized this as an area of dispute and made the following\n\nfinding:        \"I   find   based    on   the    contents    of    the   presentence\n\ninvestigation report that the criminal conduct described to his\n\na/k/a is properly his and in fact it occurred.\"                The district court\n\nreiterated those findings at the re-sentencing hearing. Wilson has\n\nfailed to demonstrate that such findings were clearly erroneous.\n\n       The district court articulated its reasons, addressed the\n\ndefendant's arguments, considered the relevant criteria and the\n\nsentence is entirely plausible.

Jimenez-\n\nBeltre, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202092\"><a href=\"/opinion/202092/united-states-v-jimenez-beltre/\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">514</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 519 (1st Cir. 2006)(en banc).
