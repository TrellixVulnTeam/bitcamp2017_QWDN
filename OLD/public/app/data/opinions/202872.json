A jury awarded Ruth Hatfield-\n\nBermudez compensatory and punitive damages after defendants José\n\nAldanondo-Rivera       and   Aida   L.    Berríos-Gómez         failed   to    renew\n\nHatfield's position as head of an adult education night school.\n\nThe jury concluded that this non-renewal violated Hatfield's First\n\nAmendment political affiliation rights, as well as her rights under\n\nArticle 1802 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code.                 See P.R. Laws Ann.\n\ntit. 31, § 5141.       The magistrate judge, presiding with the consent\n\nof the parties, vacated the political discrimination verdict for\n\nlack of key evidence.         The judge also, acting well within his\n\npowers, granted a mistrial on the Article 1802 verdict based on\n\nimproper comments by plaintiff's counsel.               On reconsideration, the\n\nmagistrate judge reversed the grant of the mistrial after deciding\n\nthat his curative instructions had been sufficient.\n\n           Hatfield appeals the grant of the Rule 50(b) motion on\n\nher   political    discrimination        claim,    as    well    as   the     earlier\n\ndismissal of a due process claim that she had also brought.\n\nAldanondo and Berríos appeal the judgment against them on the\n\nArticle 1802 claim.       We affirm.\n\n                  I.    BACKGROUND & PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\nA.         Dismissal of the Due Process Claim\n\n           Hatfield's complaint alleged that she had been working in\n\nher position for eight years under successive one-year contracts.\n\nHatfield alleged that when her contract was not renewed for the\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\f2001-2002 school year, the defendants deprived her of a property\n\nright without due process of law.\n\n            The defendants moved to dismiss the due process claim on\n\nthe basis that Hatfield's own pleadings demonstrated that she had\n\nno property right in her continued employment. In an opinion dated\n\nFebruary 11, 2003, the district court agreed and dismissed the due\n\nprocess claim.\n\n            For reasons unknown, defense counsel apparently believed\n\nthe claim was still in the case by the time of trial, and he moved\n\nto dismiss this claim pursuant to Rule 50(a) after the close of the\n\nevidence.    The magistrate judge granted the defendants' motion on\n\nthe basis that even if the evidence established that Hatfield had\n\na property right in the renewal of her contract, the defendants\n\nwere entitled to qualified immunity because there was sufficient\n\nuncertainty that such a property right existed.\n\nB.          The Political Discrimination    and   Tort   Claims:   The\n            Evidence at Trial\n\n            The discrimination and tort claims were tried before a\n\njury.   We recount the key testimony.\n\n            Hatfield's night school operated under the auspices of\n\nthe Puerto Rico Department of Education (\"PRDE\"), and Hatfield had\n\na long career working for this agency.     With the exception of a\n\nfour-year stint working in the Caguas regional office, Hatfield's\n\n\"day job\" since 1980 had been to work as the principal of two\n\ndifferent public schools in Cayey, Puerto Rico.    In 1993, Hatfield\n\n                                 -4-\n\ftook on an additional post as a school director in a night school\n\nfor adults.   For several years she directed the night program at\n\nthe Benigno Fernandez Garcia school.          Enrollment surged, and that\n\nprogram was transferred to the larger Miguel Melendez Muñoz school.\n\nHatfield continued as director, with her contract being renewed\n\neach year through the 2000-2001 school year.\n\n           Hatfield   is   a   member    of   the    New   Progressive   Party\n\n(\"NPP\").   From 1993 until early 2001, the NPP controlled Puerto\n\nRico's   governorship.     After   the    2000      elections,   the   Popular\n\nDemocratic Party (\"PDP\") took power.                The new administration\n\nquickly appointed new individuals to trust positions within the\n\nPRDE, including defendant Aldanondo, who was named the Director of\n\nPuerto Rico's Adult Education Program (\"AEP\").              Hatfield's night\n\nschool operated within the AEP.\n\n           AEPs are partially funded with federal grant money.             See\n\n34 C.F.R. § 461.1.    In Puerto Rico, the PRDE administers the AEP\n\nand decides which projects should be funded, but it must also\n\ncomply with various procedural regulations issued by the federal\n\ngovernment.   As a result, the PRDE annually requires night school\n\ndirectors to fill out detailed funding proposals in order for their\n\nparticular programs to continue in operation.              The proposals must\n\ndiscuss the program, the needs of its students, the progress the\n\nprogram had made, the objectives for the coming year, and a number\n\nof other subjects.    These proposals for continuing programs, along\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fwith any proposals for new programs, are then submitted to the PRDE\n\nfor approval. See id. §§ 461.30-33 (discussing the procedures that\n\nstates must use for selecting the recipients of AEP funds).\n\n            In    the   spring   of       2001,   the   new   PDP   administration\n\ninitiated the proposal process for the coming 2001-2002 school\n\nyear. Orientations were held in April to advise interested persons\n\non how to prepare proposals.\n\n            Hatfield attended one of these orientations.                     At that\n\nsession, a director asked whether the process for selecting school\n\ndirectors would be the same as it had been in previous years.\n\nHatfield testified that Aldanondo answered the question by saying:\n\n\"As you well know, there has been a change in administration.                       I\n\nrecommend to you that you go by the regional office, to your\n\nregional director, . . . you go and stroke them.\"                       This last\n\ncomment, to \"go and stroke them,\" was an in-court translation of\n\nthe Spanish phrase \"pasarle la mano\" -- a phrase that Aldanondo\n\nemphatically disputed using when he later testified.                         Hatfield\n\ntestified    that   there    was      a    big    commotion   immediately      after\n\nAldanondo made these comments.             School directors \"got up, started\n\nspeaking    out   loud,   and    practically        that   was   the   end    of   the\n\nmeeting.\"\n\n            Hatfield prepared a proposal for the 2001-2002 school\n\nyear.   The cover of the proposal lists Hatfield as the \"Provider\"\n\nof the proposal, and it lists the \"School or Institution\" as the\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fMiguel Melendez Muñoz High School. Another school director, Victor\n\nAyala, submitted a proposal for the nearby Augustin Fernandez Colon\n\nSchool.    Both proposals were approved, and these approvals were\n\nforwarded to the relevant regional office. These were the only two\n\nproposals submitted within the Cayey school district.\n\n            After the proposals had been approved, the PRDE began the\n\nprocess of hiring staff for the schools, including directors.\n\nHatfield testified that in prior years, school directors would go\n\nfor an interview, at the end of which each would be asked if he or\n\nshe wished to continue directing.           If the director answered \"yes,\"\n\nand that director's proposal had been approved, the director would\n\nbe given the position.             If the director said \"no,\" then the\n\nregional office would consider other candidates for that position.\n\nHatfield's description of the old hiring process was reinforced by\n\nanother witness.\n\n            This process changed in 2001.             After a proposal was\n\napproved, the director was nevertheless required to compete for the\n\nschool    for   which   he   had   prepared    the   proposal.   Hatfield's\n\nexperience confirmed that the policy change was put into effect in\n\nthe Caguas region, which encompassed Cayey.\n\n            Within that region, the hiring process after June 2001\n\nwas headed by the PRDE's Regional Director, defendant Berríos.\n\nBerríos is a member of the PDP, and the hiring for the 2001-2002\n\nschool year was the first hiring cycle in which she participated.\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fShe testified that she had looked for documents explaining how the\n\nhiring process had previously operated in the region, and that the\n\nonly useful document she found was a 1996 PRDE circular letter.\n\nThis letter explained that regional directors had to prepare a list\n\nof interested and qualified candidates, from which the selection\n\nwas to be made by a three-person committee.             That committee was to\n\nconsider the \"academic background, experience, participation in\n\ntraining[,] and disposition of the candidate.\" Because this letter\n\nprovided only limited guidance, Berríos met with her operations\n\nmanager, Ramona Nieves, to design procedures for interviewing and\n\nselection.      Nieves is the wife of the Mayor of Comerío and a PDP\n\nactivist.\n\n              Berríos   and   Nieves   devised    a    point   system   to   rank\n\ncandidates, with a maximum of 90 available points.              Some 30 points\n\nwould be based on a candidate's academic qualifications, experience\n\nwithin the PRDE generally, and experience teaching adults.                    The\n\nremaining 60 points would be based on how the committee evaluated\n\nthe candidate's response to one written and one oral question, with\n\n30 points allocated to each question. The two questions were open-\n\nended   and    did   not   have   clearly    correct    answers.    After     the\n\ninterviewing committee assigned points to each candidate, it would\n\nrank the candidates by point totals.             Berríos would then go down\n\nthe list, in order, offering director positions.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\f            Berríos was not part of the committee conducting the\n\ninterviews. The three members were Avelina Rivera, Rogelio Campos,\n\nand Margarita Gonzalez.       Rivera represented the central office and\n\nwas placed on the committee by Aldanondo. Campos had been selected\n\nfor the committee by the prior Regional Director before that\n\ndirector left her position.         Gonzalez was placed on the committee\n\nby Berríos.\n\n            Hatfield was interviewed by the committee, and she gave\n\nher answers to the oral and written questions.              Rivera then asked\n\na few questions about Hatfield's academic background.               At the end\n\nof   the   interview,    Hatfield    said    to   Rivera:     \"[R]emember,   I'm\n\ninterested in continuing working.\"           Rivera responded that she was\n\naware of this.\n\n            At   no   point   in    the     interview   did    anyone   discuss\n\nHatfield's proposal for the Miguel Melendez Muñoz school. This was\n\nnot an oversight.       Indeed, Berríos testified that she understood\n\nthe proposal process to be completely separate from the process for\n\nhiring directors.       The hiring process she and Nieves designed did\n\nnot directly account for the fact that a director had previously\n\nprepared a proposal for, or had worked at, a given school.                   The\n\nunsurprising result was that the Caguas region saw significant\n\nturnover in the identity of its directors.              Of the roughly 12-16\n\nnight schools in the Caguas region, only a single school had the\n\nsame director in 2001-2002 as in the prior year.\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\f            Hatfield was one of the many directors not reappointed.\n\nAfter the interviews had finished, and all the points had been\n\nassigned and tallied, Hatfield had 70 points. This left her ranked\n\nthird among all candidates who had applied for positions in Cayey.\n\n(As had been done in previous years, candidates formally applied to\n\nwork in a school district, not at an individual school).                 Ranked\n\nabove Hatfield were Luis Enchauste, who received 78 points, and\n\nMaria Roldán, who received 71 points.            Ranked below Hatfield were\n\nMiriam Cartagena and Ayala, the incumbent director of the Augustin\n\nFernandez     Colon    school.       Testimony   linked    Enchauste   with   an\n\naffiliation     with    the   PDP;    there   was   no    admissible   evidence\n\nregarding     the     political   affiliations      of    Roldán,   Ayala,    or\n\nCartagena.1\n\n            Hatfield scored quite well with regard to the 30 points\n\nallocated to experience and background, although she received one\n\nless point than Enchauste received in this category.                   Hatfield\n\n\n     1\n       Hatfield did testify about Roldán's affiliation, but the\nmagistrate judge struck all of that testimony as hearsay. Hatfield\ndoes not challenge that ruling on appeal.\n     The defendants briefly assert that Hatfield's testimony about\nEnchauste, in which she described how Enchauste sometimes wore PDP\ninsignia, also should have been stricken as hearsay.        In the\ndefendants' view, Enchauste's decision to wear the insignia was in\neffect an out-of-court statement of his political views. But even\nassuming that Hatfield's testimony was inadmissible to show\nEnchauste's political affiliation, the testimony would still have\nbeen admissible to demonstrate the beliefs of PRDE officials that\nEnchauste was affiliated with the PDP.       See United States v.\nParsons, 141 F.3d 386, 390-91 (1st Cir. 1998) (explaining that out-\nof-court statements are admissible to demonstrate the motive of one\nwho heard the statement).\n\n                                       -10-\n\fscored somewhat lower than Enchauste and Roldán with regard to the\n\n60 points allocated to the written and oral questions.\n\n          As Enchauste had the highest total score, Berríos met\n\nwith him first to offer him his choice of positions in Cayey.           He\n\ndid not accept either of the positions.       The second person on the\n\nlist was Roldán, who accepted a position directing the school\n\nHatfield had previously directed, the Miguel Melendez Muñoz school.\n\n          Hatfield was the third person on the list, and Berríos\n\noffered her the directorship of the remaining school, the Augustin\n\nFernandez Colon school.2 Hatfield refused, explaining that she had\n\nnot drafted the proposal for that school, and that because of her\n\n\"honesty and work quality\" she was unwilling to supplant Ayala, the\n\nprevious director.3    Berríos then offered Hatfield the opportunity\n\nto direct a school in a different school district, but Hatfield\n\ndeclined that offer as well.\n\nC.        The Motion for a Mistrial\n\n          Throughout, this trial was marked by unusually heated\n\nbickering between trial counsel. During plaintiff's questioning of\n\nwitnesses,   defense   counsel   lodged   a   rather   large   number   of\n\n\n     2\n       Hatfield testified that she immediately asked Berríos why\nshe was not being given the Miguel Melendez Muñoz school, and that\nBerríos responded that the interviewing committee had made the\ndecision based on Hatfield's health. Berríos denied saying this.\n     3\n       Hatfield also testified that she refused the job in part\nbecause she was offended that she was not offered the directorship\nof the school for which she had prepared the proposal and at which\nshe had come to be very familiar with the students.\n\n                                 -11-\n\fobjections (many of which were sustained).          The attorneys on both\n\nsides made some inappropriate comments in front of the jury.                  The\n\nmagistrate judge clearly became frustrated with counsel at times\n\nand offered some stern warnings.\n\n          At   one   point,    plaintiff's   attorney      was    seen   to    be\n\nlistening to a personal recording to assist him in examining\n\ndefendant Aldanondo.    The attorney did so to demonstrate, or to at\n\nleast leave the impression, that Aldanondo was lying on the stand\n\nabout something he had previously said.            The earlier statements\n\nwere allegedly recorded during a break at a deposition, and were\n\nnot transcribed. Listening to the recording was a direct violation\n\nof the court's instructions to plaintiff's counsel that this line\n\nof questioning could be based only on his personal recollection of\n\nthe statement.       Plaintiff's counsel's actions led to multiple\n\nobjections   and   sidebar    conferences.    After       being   admonished,\n\nplaintiff's counsel then attempted to ask his question in several\n\nalternative manners; all were objected to, and almost all of these\n\nobjections were sustained. The judge reminded the jury that simply\n\nbecause counsel was asking these questions, it did not mean that\n\nthe defendant actually made the disputed statements.\n\n          Right    before    closing   arguments    the    magistrate    judge\n\ninstructed the jury: \"[I]f at any time I admonished counsel, and I\n\ndid it throughout trial, I admonished both counsel at times, you\n\ncannot take that against or in favor of any of the parties.                    It\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fhappens in every trial.\"      The judge also reminded the jury that the\n\nclosing arguments they were about to hear were not evidence, and\n\nthat   they    were   to   base   their   verdict   only   on   the   evidence\n\npresented, not on their perceptions of the quality of counsels'\n\narguments.\n\n              This last warning proved to be prescient.          Plaintiff's\n\nattorney spoke first on closing, and his first comment to the jury\n\nwas that he would \"always remember this case as the objections\n\ncase.\"   Much of the remainder of the argument was more closely\n\nrelated to the evidence, although there were some lapses, including\n\none in which plaintiff's counsel offered his personal opinion on\n\nBerríos's testimony.       There were no objections to these lapses.\n\n              The defense attorney then opened with several comments\n\nsuggesting that his many objections had been prompted by extremely\n\npoor lawyering from the other side.          The bulk of the defendants'\n\nclosing argument largely stuck to discussing the evidence presented\n\nin the case.\n\n              Plaintiff's counsel started his rebuttal by stating: \"I\n\nwill always, always remember this case as the objections and\n\nobstructions case.         Always I will remember that.          And [in my\n\ncareer,] let me tell you, always over the table, everything,\n\neverything, everything over the table.\"         Counsel then attempted to\n\ndispute something that defense counsel had said by showing a\n\ndocument to the jury.       This prompted an objection, and at sidebar\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fit was established that the document was not in evidence.      The\n\nmagistrate judge told plaintiff's attorney that he could not use\n\nthe document during closing. Defense counsel asked for a mistrial,\n\na request that the judge said he would defer ruling on.   The judge\n\nspecifically instructed the jury to disregard the document because\n\nit was not in evidence.\n\n          Plaintiff's counsel continued his rebuttal with more\n\nsuggestions that the defense had withheld documents and lied to the\n\njury:\n\n                 Everything I brought here was over the\n          table.  Everything. Truthfulness.\n                 I have lost some cases in my life, but\n          always with the truth, not obstructing the\n          truthfulness in any case. And I assure that\n          until I die. I will do that. If I win any\n          case, it has to be with the truth. I doesn't\n          [sic] fabricate. I doesn't [sic] obstruct. I\n          doesn't [sic] hide evidence.\n                 I am not the plaintiff in this case. I\n          am not. I am just an instrument. I am just a\n          fellow who was brought up together with Ruth\n          Hatfield. Yes. Both of us grew [up] together\n          in Cayey. Both of us have cancer. It's very\n          easy to take things out of context.\n\nDefense counsel asked to approach the bench, but the magistrate\n\njudge denied the request.   Plaintiff's counsel proceeded to focus\n\nhis rebuttal more on the evidence.      After plaintiff's counsel\n\nfinished, the judge reminded the jurors that what they had just\n\nheard were \"arguments of counsel.     Arguments are not evidence.\n\nIt's just what counsel understands they have proven to you.    But\n\n\n\n\n                               -14-\n\fyou must ultimately look to the evidence in the case . . . to\n\ndetermine as to which party you will find.\"\n\nD.        The Verdict and the Post-Trial Motions\n\n          By the time the case was submitted to the jury, the only\n\nremaining defendants were Aldanondo and Berríos.4   The jury found\n\nfor Hatfield on both the political discrimination and Article 1802\n\nclaims. The jury awarded $50,000 in compensatory damages. It also\n\nawarded $100,000 in punitive damages specifically for the political\n\ndiscrimination claim.\n\n          Post-verdict, the defendants filed a motion for judgment\n\nas a matter of law under Rule 50(b), and in the alternative asked\n\nthe judge to declare a mistrial.   The Rule 50 part of the motion\n\nwas geared almost exclusively to the verdict on the political\n\ndiscrimination claim, and it only very briefly mentioned the\n\nArticle 1802 claim.\n\n          The magistrate judge granted the Rule 50 motion as to the\n\npolitical discrimination claim, based on two independent reasons.\n\nFirst, the magistrate judge concluded that part of plaintiff's\n\nburden was to demonstrate that defendants Aldanondo or Berríos were\n\naware of Hatfield's political affiliation, as required by law.\n\n\n     4\n        After resting, plaintiff voluntarily dismissed her case\nagainst Campos, who had been named as a defendant. Additionally,\nbefore closing arguments the magistrate judge granted judgment as\na matter of law for defendants Cesar Rey-Hernandez and Santos\nMelendez, as well as for Gonzalez and Rivera (who had also been\nnamed as defendants).    Those judgments are not challenged on\nappeal.\n\n                               -15-\n\fSecond, the magistrate judge concluded that there was no evidence\n\nthat either Berríos or Aldanondo had been personally involved in\n\nthe allegedly discriminatory acts, which precluded a finding of\n\nliability against either of them.\n\n            The    magistrate   judge   also   stated   that   he   did   not\n\nunderstand the defendants' motion to be seeking judgment as a\n\nmatter of law on the Article 1802 claim, and he declined to enter\n\njudgment for the defendants on that claim.        Nonetheless, the judge\n\ndecided to grant a new trial on the Article 1802 claim, based on\n\nplaintiff's attorney's improper comments during trial, particularly\n\nduring closing argument. The judge, citing Suarez Matos v. Ashford\n\nPresbyterian Community Hospital, 4 F.3d 47, 50-51 (1st Cir. 1993),\n\nexplained   that    the   comments   improperly   injected     personal   and\n\nemotional issues into the trial, and that they improperly suggested\n\nthat defense counsel had withheld evidence.\n\n            Hatfield moved for reconsideration. The magistrate judge\n\ndeclined to reconsider his decision on the Rule 50 motion.           But the\n\njudge did reverse his decision to grant a new trial on the Article\n\n1802 claim.   He concluded that the case he had relied upon, Suarez\n\nMatos, was distinguishable in an important respect: the trial court\n\nin Suarez Matos had affirmatively permitted the improper argument,\n\nwhereas here the magistrate judge had offered several curative\n\ninstructions.      Accordingly, the magistrate judge \"agree[d] with\n\n\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fplaintiff that any prejudicial effect was neutralized,\" and he\n\nreinstated the jury verdict on the Article 1802 claim.\n\n                             II.     THE DUE PROCESS CLAIM\n\n                We assume arguendo that the grant of qualified immunity\n\non the due process claim is properly before us on appeal from the\n\ngrant      of   a    Rule    50(a)   motion.5       Our     review    of    the    immunity\n\nconclusion is de novo.             Burton v. Town of Littleton, 426 F.3d 9, 14\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                Qualified immunity has three prongs in this circuit: we\n\nmust       inquire    (1)    if    the    plaintiff's       facts     can   establish     a\n\nconstitutional violation; (2) if the constitutional right at issue\n\nwas clearly established at the time of the violation; and (3) if a\n\nreasonable          official,      situated    in    a     position    similar      to   the\n\ndefendants',          would        have     understood        his     actions       to   be\n\nconstitutional. Limone v. Condon, 372 F.3d 39, 44 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nThe     general       rule    is     that     we    will     treat    these       questions\n\nsequentially, see id.; see also Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201\n\n\n\n\n       5\n        Defendants briefly suggest that Hatfield's appeal is\nuntimely because it was brought more than 30 days after the\ndistrict court partially granted the defendants' Rule 12(b)(6)\nmotion.   However, the partial judgment that the district court\ngranted was not a partial judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b), as there\nwas nothing indicating an intention by the district court to make\nan \"express determination\" that there was \"no just reason for\ndelay.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b). As a result, the partial judgment\ndid not create a final appealable order. See Willhauck v. Halpin,\n953 F.2d 689, 701-02 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n                                            -17-\n\f(2001), although there can be exceptions to this order of inquiry.\n\nSee, e.g., Santana v. Calderón, 342 F.3d 18, 29-30 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n            We begin with a discussion of the alleged procedural due\n\nprocess violation.    Hatfield must show that she was deprived of an\n\ninterest in \"liberty\" or \"property\" without due process of law.\n\nSee Correa-Martinez v. Arrillaga-Belendez, 903 F.2d 49, 53 (1st\n\nCir. 1990), overruled in part on other grounds by Educadores\n\nPuertorriqueños En Acción v. Hernández, 367 F.3d 61, 63-67 (1st\n\nCir. 2004).     Here, Hatfield alleges that she had a property\n\ninterest in her continued employment.\n\n            Property interests are \"created and . . . defined by\n\nexisting rules or understandings that stem from an independent\n\nsource such as state law.\"     Bd. of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564,\n\n577 (1972).    That independent source must give the individual a\n\nlegitimate claim of entitlement to some sort of benefit.              See Town\n\nof Castle Rock v. Gonzales, 545 U.S. 748, 756 (2005).            Hatfield's\n\nclaim is that while she had no formal contract right to renewal,\n\nthe PRDE had a de facto policy of rehiring all interested directors\n\nwhose proposals were approved, and who had no performance problems,\n\nthus   establishing   a   property    interest   in   the   renewal    of   her\n\ncontract.\n\n            The Supreme Court left open the possibility that some\n\nemployees could have a property interest in the renewal of their\n\nterm contracts.    See Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 594-95,\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\f601-02 (1972).       While mere subjective expectancy of renewal is not\n\nenough, the policies and practices of an institution might give\n\nrise to such a claim.       Id. at 603.\n\n           This provision for \"de facto\" property interests is not\n\nan unlimited opening.       If such de facto understandings contravene\n\nstate law, there is usually no legitimate expectation of renewal\n\nand hence no property interest.         Correa-Martinez, 903 F.2d at 55;\n\nsee also Perry, 408 U.S. at 602 n.7 (\"If it is the law of Texas\n\nthat a teacher in the respondent's position has no contractual or\n\nother   claim   to    job   tenure,   the    respondent's   claim   would   be\n\ndefeated.\"). Accordingly, when we encounter a Perry-type claim, we\n\nlook at whether the alleged de facto system conflicts with state\n\nlaw.    See, e.g., Correa-Martinez, 903 F.2d at 54-55; Cheveras\n\nPacheco v. Rivera Gonzalez, 809 F.2d 125, 127 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\nIndeed, we have been particularly cognizant of the problems that\n\ncan result if mid-level managers can essentially undermine a\n\nlegislature's decision to provide flexibility in a civil service\n\nhiring system.       See Correa-Martinez, 903 F.2d at 54-55.\n\n           Here, a reasonable person could easily conclude that\n\nPuerto Rico law did not permit the de facto tenure system described\n\nby Hatfield's witnesses.        In Department of Natural Resources v.\n\nCorrea, 18 P.R. Offic. Trans. 795 (1987), the Puerto Rico Supreme\n\nCourt concluded that a \"transitory employee\" like Hatfield, see\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, § 1462b(i), has \"a job retention expectancy\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\fonly during the term of the appointment.\"          18 P.R. Offic. Trans. at\n\n804.    Moreover, the court explained that these informal procedures\n\ncircumvent state law, \"destroy the merit principle[,] and . . . run\n\ncounter to the interests and needs\" of Puerto Rico.               Id. at 807.\n\nThe    court    viewed   its   decision   as   \"strengthen[ing]    the   merit\n\nprinciple in [Puerto Rico's] public administration.\"              Id.\n\n               At the same time, however, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court\n\nhas indicated that there may be certain circumstances in which a\n\ntransitory employee could have a legitimate expectancy of contract\n\nrenewal.   See id. at 805-06; see also Lupiáñez de González v. Cruz,\n\n5 P.R. Offic. Trans. 966 (1977) (finding, on the facts of the case,\n\nthat a contract employee had a legitimate expectation of permanent\n\nemployment).      But it is not entirely clear whether the Puerto Rico\n\nSupreme Court has subsequently clarified its position since 1987;\n\nif there are more relevant cases, they are in Spanish, and we have\n\nnot been provided with translations.             Cf. Giovanetti v. Estado\n\nLibre Asociado de P.R., 2004 TSPR 46 (untranslated) (appearing to\n\ndiscuss Correa and the issue of property interests for transitory\n\nemployees); Garcia Melendez v. Municipio de Arroyo, 140 P.R. Dec.\n\n750, 754-55 (P.R. 1996) (untranslated) (same).\n\n               Given the circumstances, we bypass the standard Saucier\n\norder of inquiry, thereby freeing us to ask if Hatfield's alleged\n\nconstitutional right had been clearly established at the time of\n\nthe alleged violation.          Cf. Santana, 342 F.3d at 30 (bypassing\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\fSaucier's step one in a procedural due process case where the\n\nexistence of a property right turned on an unresolved question of\n\nPuerto Rico law).6\n\n           While it may be established that due process applies to\n\nprotect property interests, it is not clearly established that the\n\ninterest Hatfield had was a property interest at all. Immunity was\n\nproperly granted.\n\n                III. THE POLITICAL DISCRIMINATION CLAIM\n\n           We review de novo the magistrate judge's decision to\n\ngrant defendants' Rule 50(b) motion for judgment as a matter of law\n\non the political discrimination claim.           See Webber v. Int'l Paper\n\nCo., 417 F.3d 229, 233 (1st Cir. 2005).          We must view the evidence\n\nin the light most favorable to Hatfield.          Id.\n\n           The magistrate judge offered two reasons for granting the\n\nRule 50(b) motion.     The first reason was that Hatfield introduced\n\nno   evidence   that   the   defendants   were    aware   of   her   political\n\n\n      6\n       Indeed, the whole premise for Saucier's order of inquiry is\nthat it helps \"set forth principles which will become the basis for\na holding that a right is clearly established.\" Saucier, 533 U.S.\nat 201. Given the context in which we face our current inquiry,\nour resolution of the constitutional issue would be dependent on\nruling on an unclear question of Puerto Rico law.       This would\nhardly create clearly established law for future cases. Cf. Morse\nv. Frederick, 127 S. Ct. 2618, 2641 (2007) (Breyer, J., concurring\nin the judgment in part and dissenting in part) (criticizing the\nSaucier order of inquiry); Dirrane v. Brookline Police Dep't, 315\nF.3d 65, 69-70 (1st Cir. 2002) (explaining that Saucier's order of\ninquiry is \"an uncomfortable exercise where . . . the answer . . .\n[to the constitutional question] may depend on a kaleidoscope of\nfacts not yet fully developed.    It may be that Saucier was not\nstrictly intended to cover [such a] case\").\n\n                                   -21-\n\faffiliation. The second reason was that Aldanondo and Berríos were\n\nnot personally involved in any discrimination against Hatfield.\n\nSee Barreto-Rivera v. Medina-Vargas, 168 F.3d 42, 48 (1st Cir.\n\n1999)   (explaining         that   §    1983     does    not    usually        allow   for\n\nsupervisory liability).            The rationale on this second point was\n\napparently that the real discriminatory actors, if any, were the\n\nmembers   of    the    evaluation        committee       who    allegedly        deflated\n\nHatfield's     interview       scores     on     the    basis      of   her     political\n\naffiliation.\n\n              Hatfield's response is that Aldanondo and Berríos fall\n\ninto an exception for § 1983's general bar against supervisory\n\nliability      because      they       encouraged,      condoned,         or    otherwise\n\nacquiesced     in     the    allegedly      discriminatory          actions      of    the\n\nevaluation committee.         Indeed, a supervisor can be held liable for\n\nthe discrimination of his subordinates if (1) the subordinate\n\ncommits   a    constitutional          violation,      and   (2)    the    supervisor's\n\nactions are \"'affirmatively link[ed]' to the behavior in the sense\n\nthat it could be characterized as 'supervisory encouragement,\n\ncondonation or acquiescence' or 'gross negligence . . . amounting\n\nto deliberate indifference.'\"              Whitfield v. Meléndez-Rivera, 431\n\nF.3d 1, 14 (1st Cir. 2005) (alteration and omission in original)\n\n(quoting Hegarty v. Somerset County, 53 F.3d 1367, 1379-80 (1st\n\nCir. 1995)).\n\n\n\n\n                                          -22-\n\f            Hatfield's   argument    nonetheless     overlooks   a   crucial\n\npoint: her failure even to make out a prima facie case that the\n\ncommittee    members   violated    her     First   Amendment   rights.     To\n\nestablish a prima facie case of political discrimination, the\n\n\"plaintiff must show that party affiliation was a substantial or\n\nmotivating factor behind a challenged employment action.\" Mercado-\n\nAlicea v. P.R. Tourism Co., 396 F.3d 46, 51 (1st Cir. 2005).                A\n\nprima facie case is not made out when there is no evidence that an\n\nactor was even aware of the plaintiff's political affiliation. See\n\nAguiar-Carrasquillo v. Agosto-Alicea, 445 F.3d 19, 26 (1st Cir.\n\n2006); Gonzalez-de-Blasini v. Family Dep't, 377 F.3d 81, 85-86 (1st\n\nCir. 2004).\n\n            There is no evidence that any of the three committee\n\nmembers was aware that Hatfield was a member of the NPP.               Campos\n\ndid not testify at trial, no evidence linked him with knowledge of\n\nHatfield's political views, and Hatfield could not say whether he\n\nwas aware of her political affiliation.             Rivera testified, but\n\nthere was a similar evidentiary gap, and Hatfield also could not\n\nstate if Rivera was aware of her political views.                    Gonzalez\n\ntestified that she did not even know Hatfield until the day of the\n\ninterview.     That    testimony    was    not   challenged,   and   Hatfield\n\n\n\n\n                                    -23-\n\fadmitted that the interview was the first time in her life that she\n\nhad ever spoken to Gonzalez.7\n\n            Hatfield argues that because she was \"identified\" with\n\nthe prior NPP administration, the committee members had to have\n\nbeen aware of her NPP affiliation.                But \"the simple fact of\n\n[plaintiff's]    employment       prior     to   the    2000    election\"      is\n\ninsufficient \"to put her co-workers and employers on notice of her\n\npolitical inclinations.\"         Aguiar-Carrasquillo, 445 F.3d at 26.\n\n            Hatfield    argues    there   was    sufficient    circumstantial\n\nevidence of discrimination to support the verdict.             She points out\n\nthat virtually all of the school directors in Caguas were replaced\n\nfor   the   2001-2002   year,     which   she    says   is   indicative   of   a\n\nsystematic plan to replace those directors associated with the\n\nprevious NPP administration.          Hatfield further argues that this\n\nfact has to be evaluated in tandem with the other circumstantial\n\nevidence in the case.\n\n            The problem is that Hatfield presented no evidence that\n\nwould allow a jury to infer that the replaced directors in Caguas\n\nwere generally from the NPP, nor was there evidence permitting the\n\ninference that the directors who replaced them were generally from\n\n\n      7\n       The closest that Hatfield came to demonstrating that any\ndefendant had knowledge of her political affiliation was testimony\nthat Berríos had once met Hatfield while Hatfield was working in a\n\"supervisory\" position at the Regional Office.       There was no\ntestimony that this position was a trust position, nor was there\ntestimony that Berríos had ever mentioned anything about Hatfield\nto the members of the committee.\n\n                                     -24-\n\fthe PDP.    The only admissible evidence on this point was that\n\nHatfield was a member of the NPP, and that Enchauste -- who\n\naccording to the testimony did not even accept a position -- was a\n\nmember of the PDP. Hatfield introduced no evidence suggesting that\n\nher qualifications were superior to Enchauste's. Without more, the\n\nfact that a single PDP individual was ranked higher than Hatfield\n\ncertainly does not provide sufficient evidence of a systematic\n\ndecision by the committee to give low scores to NPP members.\n\nFurther, Hatfield's theory throughout trial was that the committee\n\nmanipulated the scores on the written and oral questions.      Yet\n\nEnchauste also outscored Hatfield on the 30 points assigned to\n\nexperience and academic background.\n\n           Hatfield spends considerable time and energy comparing\n\nherself to Roldán.     But there was no admissible evidence of\n\nRoldán's political affiliation.\n\n           Our law requires more for Hatfield to have a viable\n\nclaim.   See, e.g., Figueroa-Serrano v. Ramos-Alverio, 221 F.3d 1,\n\n7-8 (1st Cir. 2000) (plaintiffs introduced insufficient evidence\n\nthat a mass-substitution was politically motivated, as there was no\n\nevidence that plaintiffs were actually replaced by individuals from\n\nthe opposite party); Kauffman v. P.R. Tel. Co., 841 F.2d 1169,\n\n1172-73 (1st Cir. 1988) (plaintiffs could not survive summary\n\njudgment in a case involving a massive number of substitutions,\n\noccurring immediately after a new party took power, as no evidence\n\n\n                               -25-\n\fsupported plaintiffs' allegations that the targeted individuals\n\nwere of one party, while the favored individuals were of another\n\nparty); cf. Rodríguez-Marín v. Rivera-González, 438 F.3d 72, 76 &\n\nn.1, 81 (1st Cir. 2006) (finding sufficient evidence of mass\n\ndiscrimination when there was evidence, inter alia, that NPP\n\nindividuals, but not a similarly situated PDP official, were\n\ntargeted for a personnel review); Borges Colón v. Roman-Abreu, 438\n\nF.3d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 2006) (sufficient evidence was presented in a\n\nmass substitution case where, inter alia, the targeted employees\n\nwere       generally   affiliated    with   one   party,    and    most   of   their\n\nreplacements were generally affiliated with the opposite party).\n\n               The remaining pieces of circumstantial evidence in the\n\ncase are Aldanondo's \"pasarle la mano\" comment, Aldanondo and\n\nBerríos's decisions to de-emphasize the importance of the proposals\n\nin the hiring process, the relatively high percentage of points\n\nallocated to the subjective interview questions, the timing of the\n\nhiring changes, and the fact that Aldanondo, Berríos, and Nieves\n\nwere PDP members.8        That evidence is insufficient to establish the\n\ncommittee members' knowledge of party affiliation.                   Accordingly,\n\nsince       Hatfield   did   not   demonstrate    that     the    committee    acted\n\n\n\n       8\n        Hatfield's brief does not discuss Berríos's alleged\nstatement to Hatfield that the low interview scores were based on\nHatfield's \"health problems.\" Accordingly, we deem any argument\nbased on this statement to be waived.

Comm'n, 906 F.2d 25, 40-41 (1st Cir. 1990) (explaining\nthat issues not raised in an appellant's opening brief are waived).\n\n                                       -26-\n\funconstitutionally, there can be no supervisory liability for\n\nAldanondo    and   Berríos,   and   we   affirm   the   magistrate   judge's\n\ndecision to grant them judgment as a matter of law on the political\n\ndiscrimination claim.9\n\n                       IV. THE ARTICLE 1802 CLAIM\n\n            On their cross-appeal, defendants level two challenges to\n\nthe $50,000 jury verdict for plaintiff on the Article 1802 claim.\n\nFirst, they contend that the magistrate judge should have granted\n\nthe defendants' Rule 50(b) motion for judgment as a matter of law.\n\nIn the alternative, they argue that the magistrate judge should\n\nhave stuck with his initial grant of their motion for a mistrial.\n\n            On the first issue, defendants' argument has not been\n\npreserved for appeal.     Before the magistrate judge, the defendants\n\noffered only two conclusory sentences10 on this issue in their post-\n\n\n     9\n       To the extent Hatfield is making an argument that Berríos\nand Aldanondo were personally involved in any discrimination, we\nreject that argument as well.         Hatfield's brief could be\ninterpreted as arguing that Berríos and Aldanondo changed the AEP's\nhiring procedures specifically to disadvantage the incumbent\ndirectors -- a group that Hatfield believes was \"identified\" with\nthe NPP.    According to this argument, it would be irrelevant\nwhether the committee members intentionally ranked PDP and NPP\nmembers differently; the discrimination would be the very act of\naltering the AEP's hiring procedures.      Yet this argument still\nfails at the prima facie stage: there is insufficient evidence that\nthe incumbent directors tended to be affiliated with the NPP and\nthat their replacements tended to be affiliated with the PDP.\n     10\n          The sentences were:\n\n            [A]s to the supplemental cause of action\n            brought under Article 1802 of the P.R. Civil\n            Code, the same should also be dismissed\n\n                                    -27-\n\ftrial motion.   The argument on this issue was presented so briefly\n\nthat the magistrate judge did not even realize that the argument\n\nhad been presented at all.   We have no trouble concluding that the\n\nargument cannot now be raised.   See McCoy v. Mass. Inst. of Tech.,\n\n950 F.2d 13, 22 (1st Cir. 1991) (explaining that claims cannot be\n\npresented on appeal when they have not been adequately developed in\n\nthe trial court).11\n\n            This leaves us with defendants' fallback argument for a\n\nmistrial.    We review the denial of a motion for a mistrial for\n\nmanifest abuse of discretion.    United States v. Rullan-Rivera, 60\n\nF.3d 16, 18 (1st Cir. 1995); see also Ramírez v. Debs-Elias, 407\n\nF.3d 444, 447 (1st Cir. 2005).     The granting of a mistrial is a\n\nlast resort, and the trial court's usual remedy for an impropriety\n\nwill be to give a curative instruction.    See Rodriguez-Torres v.\n\nCaribbean Forms Mfr., Inc., 399 F.3d 52, 63 (1st Cir. 2005).   The\n\n\n\n            because the plaintiff did not prove that the\n            defendants acted negligently. As a matter of\n            fact, the evidence demonstrated that Mr.\n            Aldanondo and Mrs. Berrios complied with all\n            their duties and followed all the procedures\n            established by the applicable [PRDE internal\n            documents].\n     11\n        Hatfield argues that it is inconsistent for the magistrate\njudge to have granted the Rule 50(b) motion on the political\ndiscrimination claim, while simultaneously denying the Rule 50(b)\nmotion on the Article 1802 claim. But the magistrate judge decided\nthe Article 1802 claim based on a procedural ground, whereas his\ndecision on the political discrimination claim was based on the\nmerits.   For similar reasons, there is no inconsistency in our\naffirmance of the magistrate judge's decisions.\n\n                                 -28-\n\fnormal presumption is that a jury will follow a court's curative\n\ninstruction.   United States v. De Jesus Mateo, 373 F.3d 70, 73 (1st\n\nCir. 2004).\n\n          The magistrate judge did not abuse his discretion in\n\nreversing himself and refusing to grant a mistrial in this civil\n\ncase. It is true that plaintiff's attorney made improper comments;\n\nindeed we find his behavior unacceptable.        Nonetheless, when\n\nimproprieties were brought to the magistrate judge's attention, the\n\njudge was careful to issue curative instructions to the jury. Many\n\nof these curative instructions went beyond simple reminders to the\n\njury that argument of counsel is not evidence.    Cf. United States\n\nv. Gonzalez Vargas, 558 F.2d 631, 633 (1st Cir. 1977).\n\n          The magistrate judge observed the trial firsthand, and he\n\nwas in the best position to see the effect of any improper comments\n\nand to gauge the adequacy of his curative instructions. On appeal,\n\nour review of the record has provided no basis to disturb the\n\nmagistrate judge's conclusion.\n\n                           V. CONCLUSION\n\n          The judgments are affirmed.    No costs are awarded.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -29-\n\f",

Berríos-Gómez         failed   to    renew\n\nHatfield's position as head of an adult education night school.\n\nThe jury concluded that this non-renewal violated Hatfield's First\n\nAmendment political affiliation rights, as well as her rights under\n\nArticle 1802 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code.                 See P.R. Laws Ann.\n\ntit. 31, § 5141.       The magistrate judge, presiding with the consent\n\nof the parties, vacated the political discrimination verdict for\n\nlack of key evidence.         The judge also, acting well within his\n\npowers, granted a mistrial on the Article 1802 verdict based on\n\nimproper comments by plaintiff's counsel.

We affirm.\n\n                  I.    BACKGROUND & PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\nA.         Dismissal of the Due Process Claim\n\n           Hatfield's complaint alleged that she had been working in\n\nher position for eight years under successive one-year contracts.\n\nHatfield alleged that when her contract was not renewed for the\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\f2001-2002 school year, the defendants deprived her of a property\n\nright without due process of law.\n\n            The defendants moved to dismiss the due process claim on\n\nthe basis that Hatfield's own pleadings demonstrated that she had\n\nno property right in her continued employment. In an opinion dated\n\nFebruary 11, 2003, the district court agreed and dismissed the due\n\nprocess claim.\n\n            For reasons unknown, defense counsel apparently believed\n\nthe claim was still in the case by the time of trial, and he moved\n\nto dismiss this claim pursuant to Rule 50(a) after the close of the\n\nevidence.    The magistrate judge granted the defendants' motion on\n\nthe basis that even if the evidence established that Hatfield had\n\na property right in the renewal of her contract, the defendants\n\nwere entitled to qualified immunity because there was sufficient\n\nuncertainty that such a property right existed.\n\nB.          The Political Discrimination    and   Tort   Claims:   The\n            Evidence at Trial\n\n            The discrimination and tort claims were tried before a\n\njury.   We recount the key testimony.\n\n            Hatfield's night school operated under the auspices of\n\nthe Puerto Rico Department of Education (\"PRDE\"), and Hatfield had\n\na long career working for this agency.     With the exception of a\n\nfour-year stint working in the Caguas regional office, Hatfield's\n\n\"day job\" since 1980 had been to work as the principal of two\n\ndifferent public schools in Cayey, Puerto Rico.    In 1993, Hatfield\n\n                                 -4-\n\ftook on an additional post as a school director in a night school\n\nfor adults.   For several years she directed the night program at\n\nthe Benigno Fernandez Garcia school.          Enrollment surged, and that\n\nprogram was transferred to the larger Miguel Melendez Muñoz school.\n\nHatfield continued as director, with her contract being renewed\n\neach year through the 2000-2001 school year.\n\n           Hatfield   is   a   member    of   the    New   Progressive   Party\n\n(\"NPP\").   From 1993 until early 2001, the NPP controlled Puerto\n\nRico's   governorship.     After   the    2000      elections,   the   Popular\n\nDemocratic Party (\"PDP\") took power.                The new administration\n\nquickly appointed new individuals to trust positions within the\n\nPRDE, including defendant Aldanondo, who was named the Director of\n\nPuerto Rico's Adult Education Program (\"AEP\").              Hatfield's night\n\nschool operated within the AEP.\n\n           AEPs are partially funded with federal grant money.             See\n\n34 C.F.R. § 461.1.    In Puerto Rico, the PRDE administers the AEP\n\nand decides which projects should be funded, but it must also\n\ncomply with various procedural regulations issued by the federal\n\ngovernment.   As a result, the PRDE annually requires night school\n\ndirectors to fill out detailed funding proposals in order for their\n\nparticular programs to continue in operation.              The proposals must\n\ndiscuss the program, the needs of its students, the progress the\n\nprogram had made, the objectives for the coming year, and a number\n\nof other subjects.    These proposals for continuing programs, along\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fwith any proposals for new programs, are then submitted to the PRDE\n\nfor approval. See id. §§ 461.30-33 (discussing the procedures that\n\nstates must use for selecting the recipients of AEP funds).\n\n            In    the   spring   of       2001,   the   new   PDP   administration\n\ninitiated the proposal process for the coming 2001-2002 school\n\nyear. Orientations were held in April to advise interested persons\n\non how to prepare proposals.\n\n            Hatfield attended one of these orientations.                     At that\n\nsession, a director asked whether the process for selecting school\n\ndirectors would be the same as it had been in previous years.\n\nHatfield testified that Aldanondo answered the question by saying:\n\n\"As you well know, there has been a change in administration.                       I\n\nrecommend to you that you go by the regional office, to your\n\nregional director, . . . you go and stroke them.\"                       This last\n\ncomment, to \"go and stroke them,\" was an in-court translation of\n\nthe Spanish phrase \"pasarle la mano\" -- a phrase that Aldanondo\n\nemphatically disputed using when he later testified.                         Hatfield\n\ntestified    that   there    was      a    big    commotion   immediately      after\n\nAldanondo made these comments.             School directors \"got up, started\n\nspeaking    out   loud,   and    practically        that   was   the   end    of   the\n\nmeeting.\"\n\n            Hatfield prepared a proposal for the 2001-2002 school\n\nyear.   The cover of the proposal lists Hatfield as the \"Provider\"\n\nof the proposal, and it lists the \"School or Institution\" as the\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fMiguel Melendez Muñoz High School. Another school director, Victor\n\nAyala, submitted a proposal for the nearby Augustin Fernandez Colon\n\nSchool.    Both proposals were approved, and these approvals were\n\nforwarded to the relevant regional office. These were the only two\n\nproposals submitted within the Cayey school district.\n\n            After the proposals had been approved, the PRDE began the\n\nprocess of hiring staff for the schools, including directors.\n\nHatfield testified that in prior years, school directors would go\n\nfor an interview, at the end of which each would be asked if he or\n\nshe wished to continue directing.           If the director answered \"yes,\"\n\nand that director's proposal had been approved, the director would\n\nbe given the position.             If the director said \"no,\" then the\n\nregional office would consider other candidates for that position.\n\nHatfield's description of the old hiring process was reinforced by\n\nanother witness.\n\n            This process changed in 2001.             After a proposal was\n\napproved, the director was nevertheless required to compete for the\n\nschool    for   which   he   had   prepared    the   proposal.   Hatfield's\n\nexperience confirmed that the policy change was put into effect in\n\nthe Caguas region, which encompassed Cayey.\n\n            Within that region, the hiring process after June 2001\n\nwas headed by the PRDE's Regional Director, defendant Berríos.\n\nBerríos is a member of the PDP, and the hiring for the 2001-2002\n\nschool year was the first hiring cycle in which she participated.\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fShe testified that she had looked for documents explaining how the\n\nhiring process had previously operated in the region, and that the\n\nonly useful document she found was a 1996 PRDE circular letter.\n\nThis letter explained that regional directors had to prepare a list\n\nof interested and qualified candidates, from which the selection\n\nwas to be made by a three-person committee.             That committee was to\n\nconsider the \"academic background, experience, participation in\n\ntraining[,] and disposition of the candidate.\" Because this letter\n\nprovided only limited guidance, Berríos met with her operations\n\nmanager, Ramona Nieves, to design procedures for interviewing and\n\nselection.      Nieves is the wife of the Mayor of Comerío and a PDP\n\nactivist.\n\n              Berríos   and   Nieves   devised    a    point   system   to   rank\n\ncandidates, with a maximum of 90 available points.              Some 30 points\n\nwould be based on a candidate's academic qualifications, experience\n\nwithin the PRDE generally, and experience teaching adults.                    The\n\nremaining 60 points would be based on how the committee evaluated\n\nthe candidate's response to one written and one oral question, with\n\n30 points allocated to each question. The two questions were open-\n\nended   and    did   not   have   clearly    correct    answers.    After     the\n\ninterviewing committee assigned points to each candidate, it would\n\nrank the candidates by point totals.             Berríos would then go down\n\nthe list, in order, offering director positions.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\f            Berríos was not part of the committee conducting the\n\ninterviews. The three members were Avelina Rivera, Rogelio Campos,\n\nand Margarita Gonzalez.       Rivera represented the central office and\n\nwas placed on the committee by Aldanondo. Campos had been selected\n\nfor the committee by the prior Regional Director before that\n\ndirector left her position.         Gonzalez was placed on the committee\n\nby Berríos.\n\n            Hatfield was interviewed by the committee, and she gave\n\nher answers to the oral and written questions.              Rivera then asked\n\na few questions about Hatfield's academic background.               At the end\n\nof   the   interview,    Hatfield    said    to   Rivera:     \"[R]emember,   I'm\n\ninterested in continuing working.\"           Rivera responded that she was\n\naware of this.\n\n            At   no   point   in    the     interview   did    anyone   discuss\n\nHatfield's proposal for the Miguel Melendez Muñoz school. This was\n\nnot an oversight.       Indeed, Berríos testified that she understood\n\nthe proposal process to be completely separate from the process for\n\nhiring directors.       The hiring process she and Nieves designed did\n\nnot directly account for the fact that a director had previously\n\nprepared a proposal for, or had worked at, a given school.                   The\n\nunsurprising result was that the Caguas region saw significant\n\nturnover in the identity of its directors.              Of the roughly 12-16\n\nnight schools in the Caguas region, only a single school had the\n\nsame director in 2001-2002 as in the prior year.\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\f            Hatfield was one of the many directors not reappointed.\n\nAfter the interviews had finished, and all the points had been\n\nassigned and tallied, Hatfield had 70 points. This left her ranked\n\nthird among all candidates who had applied for positions in Cayey.\n\n(As had been done in previous years, candidates formally applied to\n\nwork in a school district, not at an individual school).                 Ranked\n\nabove Hatfield were Luis Enchauste, who received 78 points, and\n\nMaria Roldán, who received 71 points.            Ranked below Hatfield were\n\nMiriam Cartagena and Ayala, the incumbent director of the Augustin\n\nFernandez     Colon    school.       Testimony   linked    Enchauste   with   an\n\naffiliation     with    the   PDP;    there   was   no    admissible   evidence\n\nregarding     the     political   affiliations      of    Roldán,   Ayala,    or\n\nCartagena.1\n\n            Hatfield scored quite well with regard to the 30 points\n\nallocated to experience and background, although she received one\n\nless point than Enchauste received in this category.                   Hatfield\n\n\n     1\n       Hatfield did testify about Roldán's affiliation, but the\nmagistrate judge struck all of that testimony as hearsay. Hatfield\ndoes not challenge that ruling on appeal.\n     The defendants briefly assert that Hatfield's testimony about\nEnchauste, in which she described how Enchauste sometimes wore PDP\ninsignia, also should have been stricken as hearsay.        In the\ndefendants' view, Enchauste's decision to wear the insignia was in\neffect an out-of-court statement of his political views. But even\nassuming that Hatfield's testimony was inadmissible to show\nEnchauste's political affiliation, the testimony would still have\nbeen admissible to demonstrate the beliefs of PRDE officials that\nEnchauste was affiliated with the PDP.

He\n\ndid not accept either of the positions.       The second person on the\n\nlist was Roldán, who accepted a position directing the school\n\nHatfield had previously directed, the Miguel Melendez Muñoz school.\n\n          Hatfield was the third person on the list, and Berríos\n\noffered her the directorship of the remaining school, the Augustin\n\nFernandez Colon school.2 Hatfield refused, explaining that she had\n\nnot drafted the proposal for that school, and that because of her\n\n\"honesty and work quality\" she was unwilling to supplant Ayala, the\n\nprevious director.3    Berríos then offered Hatfield the opportunity\n\nto direct a school in a different school district, but Hatfield\n\ndeclined that offer as well.\n\nC.        The Motion for a Mistrial\n\n          Throughout, this trial was marked by unusually heated\n\nbickering between trial counsel. During plaintiff's questioning of\n\nwitnesses,   defense   counsel   lodged   a   rather   large   number   of\n\n\n     2\n       Hatfield testified that she immediately asked Berríos why\nshe was not being given the Miguel Melendez Muñoz school, and that\nBerríos responded that the interviewing committee had made the\ndecision based on Hatfield's health. Berríos denied saying this.\n     3\n       Hatfield also testified that she refused the job in part\nbecause she was offended that she was not offered the directorship\nof the school for which she had prepared the proposal and at which\nshe had come to be very familiar with the students.\n\n                                 -11-\n\fobjections (many of which were sustained).          The attorneys on both\n\nsides made some inappropriate comments in front of the jury.                  The\n\nmagistrate judge clearly became frustrated with counsel at times\n\nand offered some stern warnings.\n\n          At   one   point,    plaintiff's   attorney      was    seen   to    be\n\nlistening to a personal recording to assist him in examining\n\ndefendant Aldanondo.    The attorney did so to demonstrate, or to at\n\nleast leave the impression, that Aldanondo was lying on the stand\n\nabout something he had previously said.            The earlier statements\n\nwere allegedly recorded during a break at a deposition, and were\n\nnot transcribed. Listening to the recording was a direct violation\n\nof the court's instructions to plaintiff's counsel that this line\n\nof questioning could be based only on his personal recollection of\n\nthe statement.       Plaintiff's counsel's actions led to multiple\n\nobjections   and   sidebar    conferences.    After       being   admonished,\n\nplaintiff's counsel then attempted to ask his question in several\n\nalternative manners; all were objected to, and almost all of these\n\nobjections were sustained. The judge reminded the jury that simply\n\nbecause counsel was asking these questions, it did not mean that\n\nthe defendant actually made the disputed statements.\n\n          Right    before    closing   arguments    the    magistrate    judge\n\ninstructed the jury: \"[I]f at any time I admonished counsel, and I\n\ndid it throughout trial, I admonished both counsel at times, you\n\ncannot take that against or in favor of any of the parties.                    It\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fhappens in every trial.\"      The judge also reminded the jury that the\n\nclosing arguments they were about to hear were not evidence, and\n\nthat   they    were   to   base   their   verdict   only   on   the   evidence\n\npresented, not on their perceptions of the quality of counsels'\n\narguments.\n\n              This last warning proved to be prescient.          Plaintiff's\n\nattorney spoke first on closing, and his first comment to the jury\n\nwas that he would \"always remember this case as the objections\n\ncase.\"   Much of the remainder of the argument was more closely\n\nrelated to the evidence, although there were some lapses, including\n\none in which plaintiff's counsel offered his personal opinion on\n\nBerríos's testimony.       There were no objections to these lapses.\n\n              The defense attorney then opened with several comments\n\nsuggesting that his many objections had been prompted by extremely\n\npoor lawyering from the other side.          The bulk of the defendants'\n\nclosing argument largely stuck to discussing the evidence presented\n\nin the case.\n\n              Plaintiff's counsel started his rebuttal by stating: \"I\n\nwill always, always remember this case as the objections and\n\nobstructions case.         Always I will remember that.          And [in my\n\ncareer,] let me tell you, always over the table, everything,\n\neverything, everything over the table.\"         Counsel then attempted to\n\ndispute something that defense counsel had said by showing a\n\ndocument to the jury.       This prompted an objection, and at sidebar\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fit was established that the document was not in evidence.      The\n\nmagistrate judge told plaintiff's attorney that he could not use\n\nthe document during closing. Defense counsel asked for a mistrial,\n\na request that the judge said he would defer ruling on.   The judge\n\nspecifically instructed the jury to disregard the document because\n\nit was not in evidence.\n\n          Plaintiff's counsel continued his rebuttal with more\n\nsuggestions that the defense had withheld documents and lied to the\n\njury:\n\n                 Everything I brought here was over the\n          table.  Everything. Truthfulness.\n                 I have lost some cases in my life, but\n          always with the truth, not obstructing the\n          truthfulness in any case. And I assure that\n          until I die. I will do that. If I win any\n          case, it has to be with the truth. I doesn't\n          [sic] fabricate. I doesn't [sic] obstruct. I\n          doesn't [sic] hide evidence.\n                 I am not the plaintiff in this case. I\n          am not. I am just an instrument. I am just a\n          fellow who was brought up together with Ruth\n          Hatfield. Yes. Both of us grew [up] together\n          in Cayey. Both of us have cancer. It's very\n          easy to take things out of context.\n\nDefense counsel asked to approach the bench, but the magistrate\n\njudge denied the request.   Plaintiff's counsel proceeded to focus\n\nhis rebuttal more on the evidence.      After plaintiff's counsel\n\nfinished, the judge reminded the jurors that what they had just\n\nheard were \"arguments of counsel.     Arguments are not evidence.\n\nIt's just what counsel understands they have proven to you.    But\n\n\n\n\n                               -14-\n\fyou must ultimately look to the evidence in the case . . . to\n\ndetermine as to which party you will find.\"\n\nD.        The Verdict and the Post-Trial Motions\n\n          By the time the case was submitted to the jury, the only\n\nremaining defendants were Aldanondo and Berríos.4   The jury found\n\nfor Hatfield on both the political discrimination and Article 1802\n\nclaims. The jury awarded $50,000 in compensatory damages. It also\n\nawarded $100,000 in punitive damages specifically for the political\n\ndiscrimination claim.\n\n          Post-verdict, the defendants filed a motion for judgment\n\nas a matter of law under Rule 50(b), and in the alternative asked\n\nthe judge to declare a mistrial.   The Rule 50 part of the motion\n\nwas geared almost exclusively to the verdict on the political\n\ndiscrimination claim, and it only very briefly mentioned the\n\nArticle 1802 claim.\n\n          The magistrate judge granted the Rule 50 motion as to the\n\npolitical discrimination claim, based on two independent reasons.\n\nFirst, the magistrate judge concluded that part of plaintiff's\n\nburden was to demonstrate that defendants Aldanondo or Berríos were\n\naware of Hatfield's political affiliation, as required by law.\n\n\n     4\n        After resting, plaintiff voluntarily dismissed her case\nagainst Campos, who had been named as a defendant. Additionally,\nbefore closing arguments the magistrate judge granted judgment as\na matter of law for defendants Cesar Rey-Hernandez and Santos\nMelendez, as well as for Gonzalez and Rivera (who had also been\nnamed as defendants).    Those judgments are not challenged on\nappeal.\n\n                               -15-\n\fSecond, the magistrate judge concluded that there was no evidence\n\nthat either Berríos or Aldanondo had been personally involved in\n\nthe allegedly discriminatory acts, which precluded a finding of\n\nliability against either of them.\n\n            The    magistrate   judge   also   stated   that   he   did   not\n\nunderstand the defendants' motion to be seeking judgment as a\n\nmatter of law on the Article 1802 claim, and he declined to enter\n\njudgment for the defendants on that claim.        Nonetheless, the judge\n\ndecided to grant a new trial on the Article 1802 claim, based on\n\nplaintiff's attorney's improper comments during trial, particularly\n\nduring closing argument. The judge, citing Suarez Matos v. Ashford\n\nPresbyterian Community Hospital, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194917\"><a href=\"/opinion/194917/suarez-matos-v-ashford-presbyterian/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 50-51 (1st Cir. 1993),\n\nexplained   that    the   comments   improperly   injected     personal   and\n\nemotional issues into the trial, and that they improperly suggested\n\nthat defense counsel had withheld evidence.\n\n            Hatfield moved for reconsideration. The magistrate judge\n\ndeclined to reconsider his decision on the Rule 50 motion.           But the\n\njudge did reverse his decision to grant a new trial on the Article\n\n1802 claim.   He concluded that the case he had relied upon, Suarez\n\nMatos, was distinguishable in an important respect: the trial court\n\nin Suarez Matos had affirmatively permitted the improper argument,\n\nwhereas here the magistrate judge had offered several curative\n\ninstructions.      Accordingly, the magistrate judge \"agree[d] with\n\n\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fplaintiff that any prejudicial effect was neutralized,\" and he\n\nreinstated the jury verdict on the Article 1802 claim.\n\n                             II.     THE DUE PROCESS CLAIM\n\n                We assume arguendo that the grant of qualified immunity\n\non the due process claim is properly before us on appeal from the\n\ngrant      of   a    Rule    50(a)   motion.5       Our     review    of    the    immunity\n\nconclusion is de novo.

Hatfield must show that she was deprived of an\n\ninterest in \"liberty\" or \"property\" without due process of law.\n\nSee Correa-Martinez v. Arrillaga-Belendez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"541732\"><a href=\"/opinion/541732/jorge-correa-martinez-v-rene-arrillaga-belendez/\"><span class=\"volume\">903</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 53 (1st\n\nCir. 1990), overruled in part on other grounds by Educadores\n\nPuertorriqueños En Acción v.

Here, Hatfield alleges that she had a property\n\ninterest in her continued employment.\n\n            Property interests are \"created and . . . defined by\n\nexisting rules or understandings that stem from an independent\n\nsource such as state law.\"     Bd. of Regents v.

That independent source must give the individual a\n\nlegitimate claim of entitlement to some sort of benefit.              See Town\n\nof Castle Rock v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799991\"><a href=\"/opinion/799991/castle-rock-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">748</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 756 (2005).            Hatfield's\n\nclaim is that while she had no formal contract right to renewal,\n\nthe PRDE had a de facto policy of rehiring all interested directors\n\nwhose proposals were approved, and who had no performance problems,\n\nthus   establishing   a   property    interest   in   the   renewal    of   her\n\ncontract.\n\n            The Supreme Court left open the possibility that some\n\nemployees could have a property interest in the renewal of their\n\nterm contracts.    See Perry v. Sindermann, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108609\"><a href=\"/opinion/108609/perry-v-sindermann/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">593</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 594-95,\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\f601-02 (1972).       While mere subjective expectancy of renewal is not\n\nenough, the policies and practices of an institution might give\n\nrise to such a claim.       Id. at 603.\n\n           This provision for \"de facto\" property interests is not\n\nan unlimited opening.       If such de facto understandings contravene\n\nstate law, there is usually no legitimate expectation of renewal\n\nand hence no property interest.         Correa-Martinez, 903 F.2d at 55;\n\nsee also Perry, 408 U.S. at 602 n.7 (\"If it is the law of Texas\n\nthat a teacher in the respondent's position has no contractual or\n\nother   claim   to    job   tenure,   the    respondent's   claim   would   be\n\ndefeated.\"). Accordingly, when we encounter a Perry-type claim, we\n\nlook at whether the alleged de facto system conflicts with state\n\nlaw.    See, e.g., Correa-Martinez, 903 F.2d at 54-55; Cheveras\n\nPacheco v. Rivera Gonzalez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"481635\"><a href=\"/opinion/481635/francisco-cheveras-pacheco-v-juan-m-rivera-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">809</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">125</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 127 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\nIndeed, we have been particularly cognizant of the problems that\n\ncan result if mid-level managers can essentially undermine a\n\nlegislature's decision to provide flexibility in a civil service\n\nhiring system.       See Correa-Martinez, 903 F.2d at 54-55.\n\n           Here, a reasonable person could easily conclude that\n\nPuerto Rico law did not permit the de facto tenure system described\n\nby Hatfield's witnesses.        In Department of Natural Resources v.\n\nCorrea, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Offic. Trans.</span> <span class=\"page\">795</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1987), the Puerto Rico Supreme\n\nCourt concluded that a \"transitory employee\" like Hatfield, see\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, § 1462b(i), has \"a job retention expectancy\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\fonly during the term of the appointment.\"          18 P.R. Offic.

Moreover, the court explained that these informal procedures\n\ncircumvent state law, \"destroy the merit principle[,] and . . . run\n\ncounter to the interests and needs\" of Puerto Rico.               Id. at 807.\n\nThe    court    viewed   its   decision   as   \"strengthen[ing]    the   merit\n\nprinciple in [Puerto Rico's] public administration.\"              Id.\n\n               At the same time, however, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court\n\nhas indicated that there may be certain circumstances in which a\n\ntransitory employee could have a legitimate expectancy of contract\n\nrenewal.

Cf.

Campos\n\ndid not testify at trial, no evidence linked him with knowledge of\n\nHatfield's political views, and Hatfield could not say whether he\n\nwas aware of her political affiliation.             Rivera testified, but\n\nthere was a similar evidentiary gap, and Hatfield also could not\n\nstate if Rivera was aware of her political views.                    Gonzalez\n\ntestified that she did not even know Hatfield until the day of the\n\ninterview.     That    testimony    was    not   challenged,   and   Hatfield\n\n\n\n\n                                    -23-\n\fadmitted that the interview was the first time in her life that she\n\nhad ever spoken to Gonzalez.7\n\n            Hatfield argues that because she was \"identified\" with\n\nthe prior NPP administration, the committee members had to have\n\nbeen aware of her NPP affiliation.                But \"the simple fact of\n\n[plaintiff's]    employment       prior     to   the    2000    election\"      is\n\ninsufficient \"to put her co-workers and employers on notice of her\n\npolitical inclinations.\"         Aguiar-Carrasquillo, 445 F.3d at 26.\n\n            Hatfield    argues    there   was    sufficient    circumstantial\n\nevidence of discrimination to support the verdict.             She points out\n\nthat virtually all of the school directors in Caguas were replaced\n\nfor   the   2001-2002   year,     which   she    says   is   indicative   of   a\n\nsystematic plan to replace those directors associated with the\n\nprevious NPP administration.          Hatfield further argues that this\n\nfact has to be evaluated in tandem with the other circumstantial\n\nevidence in the case.\n\n            The problem is that Hatfield presented no evidence that\n\nwould allow a jury to infer that the replaced directors in Caguas\n\nwere generally from the NPP, nor was there evidence permitting the\n\ninference that the directors who replaced them were generally from\n\n\n      7\n       The closest that Hatfield came to demonstrating that any\ndefendant had knowledge of her political affiliation was testimony\nthat Berríos had once met Hatfield while Hatfield was working in a\n\"supervisory\" position at the Regional Office.       There was no\ntestimony that this position was a trust position, nor was there\ntestimony that Berríos had ever mentioned anything about Hatfield\nto the members of the committee.\n\n                                     -24-\n\fthe PDP.    The only admissible evidence on this point was that\n\nHatfield was a member of the NPP, and that Enchauste -- who\n\naccording to the testimony did not even accept a position -- was a\n\nmember of the PDP. Hatfield introduced no evidence suggesting that\n\nher qualifications were superior to Enchauste's. Without more, the\n\nfact that a single PDP individual was ranked higher than Hatfield\n\ncertainly does not provide sufficient evidence of a systematic\n\ndecision by the committee to give low scores to NPP members.\n\nFurther, Hatfield's theory throughout trial was that the committee\n\nmanipulated the scores on the written and oral questions.      Yet\n\nEnchauste also outscored Hatfield on the 30 points assigned to\n\nexperience and academic background.\n\n           Hatfield spends considerable time and energy comparing\n\nherself to Roldán.     But there was no admissible evidence of\n\nRoldán's political affiliation.\n\n           Our law requires more for Hatfield to have a viable\n\nclaim.   See, e.g., Figueroa-Serrano v.

THE ARTICLE 1802 CLAIM\n\n            On their cross-appeal, defendants level two challenges to\n\nthe $50,000 jury verdict for plaintiff on the Article 1802 claim.\n\nFirst, they contend that the magistrate judge should have granted\n\nthe defendants' Rule 50(b) motion for judgment as a matter of law.\n\nIn the alternative, they argue that the magistrate judge should\n\nhave stuck with his initial grant of their motion for a mistrial.\n\n            On the first issue, defendants' argument has not been\n\npreserved for appeal.     Before the magistrate judge, the defendants\n\noffered only two conclusory sentences10 on this issue in their post-\n\n\n     9\n       To the extent Hatfield is making an argument that Berríos\nand Aldanondo were personally involved in any discrimination, we\nreject that argument as well.         Hatfield's brief could be\ninterpreted as arguing that Berríos and Aldanondo changed the AEP's\nhiring procedures specifically to disadvantage the incumbent\ndirectors -- a group that Hatfield believes was \"identified\" with\nthe NPP.    According to this argument, it would be irrelevant\nwhether the committee members intentionally ranked PDP and NPP\nmembers differently; the discrimination would be the very act of\naltering the AEP's hiring procedures.      Yet this argument still\nfails at the prima facie stage: there is insufficient evidence that\nthe incumbent directors tended to be affiliated with the NPP and\nthat their replacements tended to be affiliated with the PDP.\n     10\n          The sentences were:\n\n            [A]s to the supplemental cause of action\n            brought under Article 1802 of the P.R.

The argument on this issue was presented so briefly\n\nthat the magistrate judge did not even realize that the argument\n\nhad been presented at all.   We have no trouble concluding that the\n\nargument cannot now be raised.   See McCoy v. Mass. Inst. of Tech.,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572652\"><a href=\"/opinion/572652/james-l-mccoy-administrator-of-the-electrical-workers-trust-funds-etc-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 22 (1st Cir. 1991) (explaining that claims cannot be\n\npresented on appeal when they have not been adequately developed in\n\nthe trial court).11\n\n            This leaves us with defendants' fallback argument for a\n\nmistrial.    We review the denial of a motion for a mistrial for\n\nmanifest abuse of discretion.    United States v.

But the magistrate judge decided\nthe Article 1802 claim based on a procedural ground, whereas his\ndecision on the political discrimination claim was based on the\nmerits.   For similar reasons, there is no inconsistency in our\naffirmance of the magistrate judge's decisions.\n\n                                 -28-\n\fnormal presumption is that a jury will follow a court's curative\n\ninstruction.

It is true that plaintiff's attorney made improper comments;\n\nindeed we find his behavior unacceptable.        Nonetheless, when\n\nimproprieties were brought to the magistrate judge's attention, the\n\njudge was careful to issue curative instructions to the jury. Many\n\nof these curative instructions went beyond simple reminders to the\n\njury that argument of counsel is not evidence.    Cf. United States\n\nv.

On appeal,\n\nour review of the record has provided no basis to disturb the\n\nmagistrate judge's conclusion.\n\n                           V. CONCLUSION\n\n          The judgments are affirmed.
