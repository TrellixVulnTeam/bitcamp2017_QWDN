JESÚS IRIZARRY-MORA,\n\n                      Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                               v.\n\n                   UNIVERSITY OF PUERTO RICO,\n\n                      Defendant, Appellee.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                 FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n        [Hon. Aida M. Delgado-Colón, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n         Torruella, Lipez, and Thompson, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Edelmiro Salas González for appellant.\n     Oreste R. Ramos Pruetzel, with whom Julio Nigaglioni Arrache\nand Laura B. Arroyo-Lugo were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          July 21, 2011\n\f           LIPEZ,     Circuit     Judge.   Adhering     to    longstanding\n\nprecedent, the district court dismissed this age discrimination\n\naction against the University of Puerto Rico (\"University\" or\n\n\"UPR\") on the ground that the University is an arm of the state\n\nentitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit in federal court.\n\nOn appeal, the plaintiff asserts that this circuit's test for\n\nanalyzing whether a public entity is an arm of the state has\n\nchanged in recent years, and he argues that the University does not\n\nqualify for that status under current law.          Detecting no error in\n\nthe court's analysis, we affirm.\n\n                                     I.\n\n           We recount only briefly the underlying facts alleged in\n\nthe complaint, as the details of the alleged discrimination play no\n\nrole in our analysis.     Plaintiff Jesús Irizarry-Mora (\"Irizarry\"),\n\na sociologist with a Ph.D. in population planning, applied during\n\nthe second semester of the 2005-2006 academic year to be an\n\nAssistant Professor at the University of Puerto Rico.           He was not\n\nchosen for the position. A job announcement seeking candidates for\n\nthe   position   of   Assistant    Professor   of   Sociology    was   again\n\npublished during the fall semester of the next academic year.\n\nIrizarry reapplied, and he again was not selected.           The individual\n\nhired for the position was thirty years old.         At the time Irizarry\n\nfiled this lawsuit in 2008, he was forty-eight.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f           Irizarry    alleged    in   his   complaint   that    the    UPR\n\ndiscriminated against him on the basis of his age and retaliated\n\nagainst him for filing discrimination charges, in violation of the\n\nAge Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. § 623(a), (d). The\n\nUniversity moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction, asserting that the UPR is an arm of the state\n\nand thus entitled to immunity from suit in federal court under the\n\nEleventh Amendment. See Hess v. Port Auth. Trans-Hudson Corp., 513\n\nU.S. 30, 39 (1994); Fresenius Med. Care Cardiovascular Res., Inc.\n\nv. P.R. & the Caribbean Cardiovascular Ctr. Corp., 322 F.3d 56, 59\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).\n\n           In ruling on the motion to dismiss, the district court\n\nobserved that the District of Puerto Rico and the First Circuit had\n\n\"consistently concluded that the UPR is an instrumentality of the\n\nstate for Eleventh Amendment purposes and, as such, is not amenable\n\nto suit in federal court.\"       Irizarry-Mora v. Univ. of P.R., No.\n\n3:08-cv-2004-ADC, slip op. at 5 (D.P.R. Aug. 24, 2009).          The court\n\nrejected Irizarry's argument that our decision in Fresenius had set\n\nout a \"totally new test\" for identifying an arm of the state and\n\nthus cast doubt on the validity of earlier precedent.            The court\n\nfurther noted that the District of Puerto Rico had reexamined the\n\nUPR's   status   on   numerous   occasions   after   Fresenius    and   had\n\n\"declined to depart from the 'well settled proposition' that the\n\nUPR is immune from suit in federal court.\"       Id. (quoting Montalvo-\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fPadilla v. Univ. of P.R., 492 F. Supp. 2d 36, 44 (D.P.R. 2007)).\n\nThe court also pointed to the First Circuit's reiteration after\n\nFresenius, \"albeit in passing, that the UPR is an arm of the\n\nCommonwealth and shares its sovereign immunity.\"          Id. (citing\n\nMontalvo-Padilla, 492 F. Supp. 2d at 44 (citing Toledo v. Sánchez,\n\n454 F.3d 24, 31 n.1 (1st Cir. 2006); Aponte-Torres v. Univ. of\n\nP.R., 445 F.3d 50, 55 (1st Cir. 2006))).\n\n          Notwithstanding   the    precedent   weighing   against   the\n\nplaintiff's position, the district court went on to perform its own\n\nthoughtful evaluation of the arm-of-the-state factors prescribed in\n\nthe case law.   See infra Section II.   It agreed with the previous\n\ndecisions in concluding that the UPR is entitled to immunity from\n\nsuit in federal court.   Hence, it dismissed Irizarry's action, and\n\nthis appeal followed.1\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       The district court also rejected Irizarry's request for\nequitable relief under the Ex Parte Young doctrine, which allows\nprospective injunctive relief against state officers who are sued\nin their official capacities. See Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123\n(1908); Negrón-Almeda v. Santiago, 579 F.3d 45, 52 (1st Cir. 2009).\nIrizarry's suit names as a defendant only the University, not any\nindividuals. In the absence of consent, waiver, or abrogation, the\nEleventh Amendment bars suit against states themselves regardless\nof the form of relief sought.     Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v.\nHalderman, 465 U.S. 89, 100 (1984); Metcalf & Eddy, Inc. v. P.R.\nAqueduct & Sewer Auth., 991 F.2d 935, 938 (1st Cir. 1993); see also\nTorres-Álamo v. Puerto Rico, 502 F.3d 20, 24 (1st Cir. 2007)\n(noting that the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is treated as a state\nfor purposes of the Eleventh Amendment).      In his reply brief,\nIrizarry states that he does not challenge the court's ruling on\ninjunctive relief.\n\n                                  -4-\n\f                                  II.\n\nA. Legal Background\n\n           Before our 2006 decision in Fresenius, this court for\n\nmore than a decade had assessed an entity's arm-of-the-state status\n\nunder a multi-factor test that was set out in Metcalf & Eddy, Inc.\n\nv. Puerto Rico Aqueduct & Sewer Authority, 991 F.2d 935, 939-40\n\n(1st Cir. 1993). In Fresenius, we examined Supreme Court decisions\n\nthat had \"updated and clarified the arm-of-the-state doctrine\" in\n\nthe years since Metcalf & Eddy to determine \"whether those opinions\n\ncause us to reshape the Metcalf & Eddy test.\"         Fresenius, 322 F.3d\n\nat 63.   Concluding that a reshaping was appropriate, id. at 59, we\n\nrelied primarily on the Court's decision in Hess to reformulate our\n\nanalysis as a two-part inquiry whose steps reflected the Eleventh\n\nAmendment's   twin   concerns   for   the   States'   dignity   and   their\n\nfinancial solvency.     Fresenius, 322 F.3d at 63, 68.          Under that\n\n\"two-stage framework,\"\n\n           a court must first determine whether the state\n           has indicated an intention – either explicitly\n           by statute or implicitly through the structure\n           of the entity – that the entity share the\n           state's sovereign immunity.    If no explicit\n           indication exists, the court must consider the\n           structural    indicators   of    the   state's\n           intention.     If these point in different\n           directions, the court must proceed to the\n           second stage and consider whether the state's\n           treasury would be at risk in the event of an\n           adverse judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fRedondo Constr. Corp. v. P.R. Highway & Transp. Auth., 357 F.3d\n\n124, 126 (1st Cir. 2004) (citation omitted); see also Fresenius,\n\n322 F.3d at 65-66.\n\n            Appellant asserts that this evolution of the law means\n\nthat arm-of-the-state determinations predating Fresenius are no\n\nlonger binding. That argument, however, fails to recognize that we\n\nexplicitly stated in Fresenius that the \"reshaping\" of our law did\n\nnot represent an actual change in the substance of the analysis.\n\nWe observed that Hess had \"refined\" the Metcalf & Eddy analysis,\n\nwhich we described as \"consistent with Hess.\"    Fresenius, 322 F.3d\n\nat 68.     Indeed, we observed that Metcalf & Eddy \"presciently\n\npredicted the ways in which the Supreme Court would view the\n\nissue.\"    Id. at 62.\n\n            The \"reshaping\" effected in Fresenius was the replacement\n\nof Metcalf & Eddy's multi-factor test with the Supreme Court's\n\ntwo-part inquiry: first, the structural prong and, if necessary,\n\nthe impact-on-the-treasury prong.      The specific considerations\n\nremained essentially the same, however, because the Metcalf & Eddy\n\nfactors covered elements relevant to both the agency's operational\n\nautonomy and its fiscal independence.2     Although the inquiry was\n\n\n     2\n         We listed the following seven factors in Metcalf & Eddy:\n\n     (1) whether the agency has the funding power to enable it\n     to satisfy judgments without direct state participation\n     or guarantees; (2) whether the agency's function is\n     governmental or proprietary; (3) whether the agency is\n     separately incorporated; (4) whether the state exerts\n\n                                 -6-\n\fnot framed as a progression from one stage to the next, as in\n\nFresenius and Hess, the same \"two key questions\" and the same types\n\nof factors informed our analysis.3    Fresenius, 322 F.3d at 68.\n\nHence, Fresenius was not a turning point in our Eleventh Amendment\n\njurisprudence.   Rather, our course was fixed in Metcalf & Eddy,\n\n\n     control over the agency, and if so, to what extent; (5)\n     whether the agency has the power to sue, be sued, and\n     enter contracts in its own name and right; (6) whether\n     the agency's property is subject to state taxation; and\n     (7) whether the state has immunized itself from\n     responsibility for the agency's acts or omissions.\n\n991 F.2d at 939-40.\n     3\n        Under Hess, as described     in   Fresenius,   the   relevant\nstructural considerations include:\n\n     (1) extent of state control including through the\n     appointment of board members and the state's power to\n     veto   board    actions   or   enlarge    the   entity's\n     responsibilities; (2) how the enabling and implementing\n     legislation characterized the entity and how the state\n     courts have viewed the entity; (3) whether the entity's\n     functions are readily classifiable as state functions or\n     local or non-governmental functions; and (4) whether the\n     state bore legal liability for the entity's debts.\n\nFresenius, 322 F.3d at 65 n.7 (citing Hess, 513 U.S. at 44-46).\n\nThe relevant considerations on the fiscal relationship include:\n\n     whether the state laws impose an obligation on the state\n     to be responsible for payment of judgments against the\n     entity (on this point federal courts are not free to\n     assume that a state will voluntarily assume the payment\n     of the entity's debts if the entity is in need); other\n     sources of revenue for the entity; and whether the agency\n     is so structured that, as a practical matter, the state\n     anticipated budget shortfalls that would render the\n     entity constantly dependent on the state.\n\nFresenius, 322 F.3d at 65 n.8 (citing Hess, 513 U.S. at 49-50).\n\n                               -7-\n\fwhich \"foreshadowed\" Hess in determining that \"when there is\n\nambiguity from the structure about whether an entity is an arm of\n\nthe state, the primary focus is on the risk to the state treasury.\"\n\nId. at 66.\n\n           Arguably, our conclusion that the substance of the law\n\ndid not change in Fresenius is enough to resolve this case.                        We\n\nobserved in Metcalf & Eddy that \"[w]here the agency's activity and\n\nits relation to the state remain essentially the same, prior\n\ncircuit precedent will be controlling.\"                   991 F.2d at 940 n.4.\n\nIndeed, the UPR has been deemed an arm of the state for more than\n\nthree decades, see Pinto v. Universidad de P.R., 895 F.2d 18, 18\n\n(1st Cir. 1990); Perez v. Rodriguez Bou, 575 F.2d 21, 25 (1st Cir.\n\n1978),   and   no    factual     change      in   its     relationship     with   the\n\nCommonwealth is asserted.         The principle of stare decisis thus has\n\nconsiderable force here.\n\n           Nonetheless, we recognize that the original precedent on\n\nthe UPR's status predates even Metcalf & Eddy.                     In addition,\n\nalthough we have assumed the continuing validity of that precedent\n\nat least twice since Fresenius, the Eleventh Amendment was not a\n\nlive issue in either case.             See Toledo, 454 F.3d at 31 n.1, 40\n\n(finding   that     the    UPR   was   not     entitled    to   immunity    for   the\n\nparticular claims at issue); Aponte-Torres, 445 F.3d at 53, 55\n\n(holding that the plaintiffs \"fail[ed] to articulate a cognizable\n\nfederal claim\").          Thus, like the district court, we think brief\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fconsideration of the two-part Fresenius inquiry is warranted to\n\nconfirm that our precedent is in line with current law.4\n\nB. Application of the Arm-of-the-State Test\n\n            1.    Structural Factors\n\n            The    distinctive,      public-oriented     role    that    a   state\n\nuniversity       typically   plays    in     its   state's   higher     education\n\nlandscape undoubtedly accounts for the fact that \"the vast majority\n\nof state universities . . . have been found to be 'arms' of the\n\nState.\"     See Univ. of R.I. v. A.W. Chesterton Co., 2 F.3d 1200,\n\n1204 (1st Cir. 1993); see also 13 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R.\n\nMiller, Edward H. Cooper & Richard D. Freer, Federal Practice &\n\nProcedure    §     3524.2,   at    325-32     (2008)   (noting    that       \"state\n\nuniversities usually are considered arms of the state\").                       Each\n\nstate university nonetheless \"must be evaluated in light of its\n\nunique characteristics.\"          A.W. Chesterton, 2 F.3d at 1204.\n\n            Although Puerto Rico law contains no explicit statement\n\nof intention that the University share the Commonwealth's sovereign\n\n\n\n     4\n       The district court dismissed the case for lack of subject\nmatter jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1),\nalthough it referenced documents outside the complaint. Whether\nthe court's ruling is treated as a dismissal under Rule 12(b) or a\ngrant of summary judgment, our standard of review is de novo. See\nWojcik v. Mass. State Lottery Comm'n, 300 F.3d 92, 98 (1st Cir.\n2002) (stating that application of \"the immunity doctrine under the\nEleventh Amendment is a question of law that engenders de novo\nreview on appeal\"). In either case, we also view the record in the\nlight most favorable to the non-moving party. See McCloskey v.\nMueller, 446 F.3d 262, 266 (1st Cir. 2006) (Rules 12(b)(1) and\n12(b)(6)); Fresenius, 322 F.3d at 68 (summary judgment).\n\n                                       -9-\n\fimmunity, statutory provisions and case law together describe a\n\npublic role for the University consistent with such a relationship.\n\nBy statute, the UPR has an \"obligation of service to the people of\n\nPuerto Rico,\" P.R. Laws Ann., tit. 18, § 601(a), and it is exempted\n\nfrom the payment of taxes because it \"achieves a public purpose of\n\nthe Commonwealth.\"   Id. § 612(f).\n\n            The   UPR's   important    public   role   also   has   been\n\nacknowledged by the Puerto Rico Supreme Court.         In University of\n\nPuerto Rico v. Puerto Rico Association of University Professors,\n\n136 P.R. Dec. 335, No. JR-91-103 (June 13, 1994),5 the court noted\n\nthe UPR's obligation \"[a]s a university of the State . . . to serve\n\nthe People of Puerto Rico,\" Unoff. Trans. at 44 (quotation marks\n\nomitted), and it rejected a suggestion that the UPR could increase\n\nfees to the same extent as could a private university in order to\n\nraise revenue:\n\n          For evident reasons, increasing the costs of\n          registration so substantially would create\n          very serious problems concerning the role\n          played by U.P.R. in Puerto Rico's society, not\n          to    mention    those    related    to    its\n          implementation.   An increase like the Board\n          suggests, sufficiently high so as to convert\n          the U.P.R. into a profitable operation, would\n          cause   serious    problems,   for    example,\n          concerning students. It would affect both the\n          capacity of our young ones to obtain good\n          quality higher education as well as the\n          U.P.R.'s capacity to fulfill its statutory\n          mission of developing the intellectual and\n\n\n     5\n       The parties stipulated to a partial translation of this\ncase, and our citations will be to that unofficial translation.\n\n                                -10-\n\f          spiritual wealth of our people, \"especially\n          those less favored in terms of financial\n          resources.\" 18 L.P.R.A. sec. 601(b)(4).6\n\nId. at 45 (emphasis omitted).7   The Commonwealth's reliance on the\n\nUPR to make higher education accessible to students for whom the\n\ngovernment feels a special responsibility is also shown by a\n\nspecific UPR tuition exemption for the children of Puerto Rico\n\nmilitary members who have died in action, remain missing, or are\n\nprisoners of war.   See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 18, § 612(b).\n\n          In further support of the proposition that the University\n\nis an arm of the Commonwealth, we note that ten of the thirteen\n\nmembers of its governing board are appointed by the governor, with\n\nthe advice and consent of the Puerto Rico Senate, P.R. Laws Ann.\n\n\n     6\n      Section 601 lists the objectives of the University of Puerto\nRico and directs the University to, inter alia,\n\n     [f]ully develop the intellectual and spiritual wealth\n     latent in our people, so that the values of the\n     intelligence and spirit of the exceptional personalities\n     that arise from all social sectors, especially those\n     least favored in economic resources, may be put to the\n     service of the Puerto Rican community.\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 18, § 601(b)(4).\n     7\n       Although the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's ruling does not\ndirectly address the question of sovereign immunity and would not,\nin any event, be dispositive on the question, its observations are\npertinent to our attempt to divine legislative intent. See Redondo\nConstr. Corp., 357 F.3d at 128 (noting that, \"'[w]hile not\ndispositive, consistent decisions of a state's highest court\nconstruing an agency's or institution's relationship with the\ncentral government are important guideposts in a reasoned attempt\nto locate the agency's or institution's place within the scheme of\nthings.'\" (alteration in original) (quoting Metcalf & Eddy, 991\nF.2d at 942)).\n\n                                 -11-\n\ftit. 18, § 602(b)(1),8 and the Board originally was convened by the\n\nSecretary of Education, id. § 602(b)(4).

Id. § 602(b)(2).\n      9\n       We observed in Fresenius that \"[t]he governor's appointment\npower over the board is not enough in itself to establish that [an\nentity] is an arm of the state.\" 322 F.3d at 71. In fact, where,\nas here, the governor-appointed board members serve terms\npotentially longer than a governor's tenure and may \"only be\ndischarged after determination of just cause after filing charges,\"\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 18, § 602(b)(2), the trustees are insulated \"to\nsome degree\" from political pressure, and the University's\nindependence is accordingly increased. See A.W. Chesterton Co., 2\nF.3d at 1208. It remains structurally significant, however, that\nthe University's governing authority resides primarily in\nindividuals appointed by the governor.\n\n                                     -12-\n\funiversity system's annual budget and the appointment of the\n\nFinance Director, and it is charged with \"[r]ender[ing] a yearly\n\nreport     to     the    Governor      and     the   Legislature      concerning      its\n\nactivities and the status and finances of the University.\"                           Id.\n\n§ 602 (e)(8), (9), (10).\n\n                These    structural     signals      strongly      indicate   that the\n\nCommonwealth's \"'dignity' interest as a sovereign in not being\n\nhaled into federal court\" embraces the University.                       See Fresenius,\n\n322 F.3d at 63.              Yet we acknowledge that the UPR also possesses\n\nattributes of an autonomous agency.                    It controls and may acquire\n\nits own properties, it may create subsidiary corporations, and its\n\ndebts are by law not considered those of the Commonwealth.                            See\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 18, §§ 612(a), 602(e)(19), 612(f), 822.                            As\n\nappellant argues, the University has \"a significant degree of\n\nautonomy\" to set policy, see id. §§ 602(d), 603(a),10 and the UPR\n\nis   authorized         to    borrow   money    \"for    any   of   its    purposes    and\n\nactivities\" by issuing bonds or notes, id. § 612(e).                       It also has\n\nauthority to raise revenue by charging tuition and other fees, id.\n\n\n\n      10\n        Section 602(d), titled \"Powers and duties,\" states that\n\"[t]he Board shall formulate the directives which shall govern the\ndirection and development of the University, it shall examine and\napprove the general operational standards proposed by the\nlegislative and administrative bodies of the latter, . . . and\nshall supervise the general progress of the institution.\"\n     Section 603(a) states that the University \"shall function with\nacademic and administrative autonomy within the standards provided\nby this chapter and those that may be set forth in the University\nregulations or in resolutions of the Board of Trustees.\"\n\n                                             -13-\n\f§ 612(b),11 and to spend the proceeds generated from such sources,\n\nas well as from the sale of property and donations, \"in the best\n\ninterest of the University,\" id. § 612(c). Although the University\n\nis   expressly   authorized   to   issue   bonds   \"for   the   purpose   of\n\nacquiring or constructing any project,\" such revenue bonds \"shall\n\nnot constitute a debt of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\" and shall\n\nnot \"pledge the good faith and credit of the Commonwealth.\"          Id. §\n\n822.\n\n            The authority to conduct day-to-day operations is not\n\nnecessarily inconsistent with a conclusion that the Commonwealth\n\nintends the UPR to share its sovereign status.        See, e.g., Kashani\n\nv. Purdue Univ., 813 F.2d 843, 847 (7th Cir. 1987) (\"[T]hese powers\n\nare granted the university only so that it is able to carry out its\n\nprimary purpose of education, in contrast to a city or county,\n\nwhose exercise of such powers . . . is its very raison d'etre.\").\n\nYet, some of the structural indicators unquestionably point in the\n\nother direction.   We thus think it prudent to proceed to the second\n\nstage of the Eleventh Amendment inquiry \"and consider whether the\n\nstate's treasury would be at risk in the event of an adverse\n\njudgment.\"   Redondo Constr. Corp., 357 F.3d at 126.\n\n\n\n       11\n        As the Puerto Rico Supreme Court observed in the passage\nquoted above, however, the power to assess tuition and fees may as\na practical matter be limited by the UPR's mission to serve\n\"especially those least favored in economic resources,\" P.R. Laws\nAnn. tit. 18, § 601(b)(4). See P.R. Ass'n of Univ. Profs., 136\nP.R. Dec. 335, Unoff. Trans. at 45.\n\n                                   -14-\n\f               2.   Impact on the Treasury\n\n               It is undisputed that the Commonwealth provides the bulk\n\nof the funding for the University's operations.                       By law, the\n\nCommonwealth must dedicate 9.6% of its general fund revenues to the\n\nUPR.        P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 18, § 621-1.           The parties debate what\n\npercentage of the University's budget those funds represent, but\n\neven appellant acknowledges that more than sixty percent of the\n\nUPR's funding comes from the government.                  He argues that the\n\ninstitution's non-government funds are \"more than sufficient\" to\n\nsatisfy any judgments, asserting that in one recent year the UPR\n\nhad nearly $579 million in non-Commonwealth income.12                 Appellant's\n\ncalculations,        however,    patently     overestimate      the   University's\n\navailable resources by including funds that are identified as\n\nrestricted in the budget document on which he relies.                   Indeed, in\n\nthe reported year, 2008-2009, only about one-fifth of the non-\n\nCommonwealth funds appear to have been unrestricted,13 leaving the\n\nCommonwealth        as   the   source   for   nearly   ninety    percent   of   the\n\n\n       12\n        Appellant draws his figures from a document included in the\nappendix and titled \"University of Puerto Rico Consolidated Budget\nby Funding Account\" for fiscal year 2008-2009. He reports that the\ndocument was taken from the University's annual report, as\npublished on its website. We rely on the same document.\n       13\n       Appellant asserts that the UPR's 2008-2009 budget reports\nnearly $579 million in income from sources other than the\nCommonwealth government, or thirty-seven percent of its budget. Of\nthat sum, however, more than $258 million was in restricted federal\nfunds, $99 million was identified as allocated to a \"Permanent\nImprovement Program,\" and another $100 million of donations and\nself-generated revenues were labeled as restricted funds.\n\n                                        -15-\n\fUniversity's general fund.      See P.R. Ass'n of Univ. Profs., 136\n\nP.R. Dec. 335, Unoff. Trans. at 42 (observing that, at the time of\n\nthe decision in 1994, eighty-six percent of the University's budget\n\ncame from the General Fund of the Commonwealth).\n\n           More importantly, however, the University's status cannot\n\nturn on whether its budget shows enough non-Commonwealth income to\n\nallow it, in theory, to pay a court judgment.            Allocating any\n\nportion   of   the   University's   general   fund   revenues   to   court\n\njudgments not only would dilute the impact of the public funds the\n\nUPR receives, but such damage awards also would diminish the\n\nUniversity's ability to comply with its statutory mission to\n\nprovide \"good quality higher education\" for all residents of Puerto\n\nRico. Id. at 45.14    The UPR does not have the flexibility to offset\n\n\n     14\n       In both Fresenius and Metcalf & Eddy, we emphasized that \"a\nstate agency cannot claim Eleventh Amendment immunity solely on the\nbasis that judgments against it may absorb unrestricted funds\ndonated by the state and, in that way, redound indirectly to the\ndepletion of the state's treasury.\" Metcalf & Eddy, 991 F.2d at\n941; see also Fresenius, 322 F.3d at 75. That description does not\napply to the significantly different financial circumstances here.\nIn Metcalf & Eddy, the agency at issue received some government\nfunding but was largely financed by user fees and bonds. 991 F.2d\nat 940. Similarly, in Fresenius, most of the agency's funding came\nfrom \"sources other than the Commonwealth's treasury.\" 322 F.3d at\n72.\n     Contrary to appellant's suggestion, the Commonwealth's 2009\nfiscal stabilization act has no effect on our analysis as it did\nnot change the financial relationship between the Commonwealth and\nthe University. It excluded new revenues raised under the Act from\nthe statutory 9.6 percent funding formula so that such revenues\ncould be \"expressly directed to reducing the structural deficit of\nthe Central Government.\" 2009 P.R. Laws Act No. 7, Statement of\nMotives (\"Special Act to Declare a State of Fiscal Emergency and to\nEstablish a Comprehensive Fiscal Stabilization Plan to Salvage the\n\n                                    -16-\n\funanticipated expenses by passing the additional costs on to its\n\ncustomers.    See id.; cf. Metcalf & Eddy, 991 F.2d at 940 (\"Although\n\nthe central government subsidizes the agency to some extent, [the\n\nagency] relies mostly on user fees and bonds to support its\n\noperations.\").         Because providing affordable higher education for\n\nPuerto Rico residents is the Commonwealth's goal, the Commonwealth\n\nmust as a practical matter ensure the University's financial\n\nviability    –    regardless      of    its   responsibility        for   particular\n\nUniversity debts.            We suggested as much in Fresenius, where we\n\nobserved that the Commonwealth may indirectly assume the obligation\n\nfor an entity's debts \"by providing virtually all the funds needed\n\nfor [its] operation.\"           322 F.3d at 72; see also Pastrana-Torres,\n\n460 F.3d at 128 (same); Metcalf & Eddy, 991 F.2d at 941 (quoting\n\nBlake   v.   Kline,      612   F.2d    718,   723   (3d     Cir.    1979),   for   the\n\nproposition      that    \"'the    nature      of   the    state's    obligation    to\n\ncontribute       may    be     more    important     than     the    size    of    the\n\ncontribution'\").\n\n             In sum, the Commonwealth's investment, financial and\n\notherwise, in the UPR's ability to fulfill its \"obligation of\n\nservice to the people of Puerto Rico,\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 18,\n\n§ 601(a), puts Commonwealth funds at risk when University funds are\n\nat risk. Hence, we are comfortable that our longstanding precedent\n\nremains consistent with current Eleventh Amendment principles.\n\n\nCredit of Puerto Rico\").\n\n                                         -17-\n\fAccordingly, we affirm the district court's judgment dismissing\n\nthis action on the ground that appellant's claims are foreclosed by\n\nthe Eleventh Amendment.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -18-\n\f",

On appeal, the plaintiff asserts that this circuit's test for analyzing whether a public entity is an arm of the state has changed in recent years, and he argues that the University does not qualify for that status <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> under current law. Detecting no error in the court's analysis, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>We recount only briefly the underlying facts alleged in the complaint, as the details of the alleged discrimination play no role in our analysis. Plaintiff Jesús Irizarry-Mora (\"Irizarry\"), a sociologist with a Ph.D. in population planning, applied during the second semester of the 2005-2006 academic year to be an Assistant Professor at the University of Puerto Rico. He was not chosen for the position. A job announcement seeking candidates for the position of Assistant Professor of Sociology was again published during the fall semester of the next academic year. Irizarry reapplied, and he again was not selected. The individual hired for the position was thirty years old. At the time Irizarry filed this lawsuit in 2008, he was forty-eight.</p>\n<p>Irizarry alleged in his complaint that the UPR discriminated against him on the basis of his age and retaliated against him for filing discrimination charges, in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. § 623(a), (d). The University moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, asserting that the UPR is an arm of the state and thus entitled to immunity from suit in federal court under the Eleventh Amendment. <i>See </i><i>Hess v. Port Auth. Trans-Hudson Corp.,</i> 513 U.S. 30, 39, 115 S.Ct. 394, 130 L.Ed.2d 245 (1994); <i>Fresenius Med. Care Cardiovascular Res., Inc. v. P.R. &amp; the Caribbean Cardiovascular Ctr. Corp.,</i> 322 F.3d 56, 59 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n<p>In ruling on the motion to dismiss, the district court observed that the District of Puerto Rico and the First Circuit had \"consistently concluded that the UPR is an instrumentality of the state for Eleventh Amendment purposes and, as such, is not amenable to suit in federal court.\" <i>Irizarry-Mora v. Univ. of P.R.,</i> No. 3:08-cv-2004-ADC, slip op. at 5 (D.P.R. Aug. 24, 2009). The court rejected Irizarry's argument that our decision in <i>Fresenius</i> had set out a \"totally new test\" for identifying an arm of the state and thus cast doubt on the validity of earlier precedent. The court further noted that the District of Puerto Rico had reexamined the UPR's status on numerous occasions after <i>Fresenius</i> and had \"declined to depart from the `well settled proposition' that the UPR is immune from suit in federal court.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Montalvo-Padilla v. Univ. of P.R.,</i> 492 F.Supp.2d 36, 44 (D.P.R.2007)). The court also pointed to the First Circuit's reiteration after <i>Fresenius,</i> \"albeit in passing, that the UPR is an arm of the Commonwealth and shares its sovereign immunity.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Montalvo-Padilla,</i> 492 F.Supp.2d at 44 (citing <i>Toledo v. Sánchez,</i> 454 F.3d 24, 31 n. 1 (1st Cir.2006); <i>Aponte-Torres v. Univ. of P.R.,</i> 445 F.3d 50, 55 (1st Cir.2006))).</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the precedent weighing against the plaintiff's position, the district court went on to perform its own thoughtful evaluation of the arm-of-the-state factors prescribed in the case law. <i>See infra</i> Section II. It agreed with the previous decisions in concluding that the UPR is entitled to immunity from suit in federal court. Hence, it dismissed Irizarry's action, and this appeal followed.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> II.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Legal Background</h2>\n<p>Before our 2006 decision in <i>Fresenius,</i> this court for more than a decade had assessed an entity's arm-of-the-state status under a multi-factor test that was set out in <i>Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc. v. Puerto Rico Aqueduct &amp; Sewer Authority,</i> 991 F.2d 935, 939-40 (1st Cir.1993). In <i>Fresenius,</i> we examined Supreme Court decisions that had \"updated and clarified the arm-of-the-state doctrine\" in the years since <i>Metcalf &amp; Eddy</i> to determine \"whether those opinions cause us to reshape the <i>Metcalf &amp; Eddy</i> test.\" <i>Fresenius,</i> 322 F.3d at 63. Concluding that a reshaping was appropriate, <i>id.</i> at 59, we relied primarily on the Court's decision in <i>Hess</i> to reformulate our analysis as a two-part inquiry whose steps reflected the Eleventh Amendment's twin concerns for the States' dignity and their financial solvency. <i>Fresenius,</i> 322 F.3d at 63, 68. Under that \"two-stage framework,\"</p>\n<blockquote>a court must first determine whether the state has indicated an intention either explicitly by statute or implicitly through the structure of the entitythat the entity share the state's sovereign immunity. If no explicit indication exists, the court must consider the structural indicators of the state's intention. If these point in different directions, the court must proceed to the second stage and consider whether the state's treasury would be at risk in the event of an adverse judgment.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Redondo Constr. Corp. v. P.R. Highway &amp; Transp. Auth.,</i> 357 F.3d 124, 126 (1st Cir. 2004) (citation omitted); <i>see also </i><i>Fresenius,</i> 322 F.3d at 65-66.</p>\n<p>Appellant asserts that this evolution of the law means that arm-of-the-state determinations predating <i>Fresenius</i> are no longer binding. That argument, however, fails to recognize that we explicitly stated in <i>Fresenius</i> that the \"reshaping\" of our law did not represent an actual change in the substance of the analysis. We observed that <i>Hess</i> had \"refined\" the <i>Metcalf &amp; Eddy</i> analysis, which we described as \"consistent with <i>Hess.</i>\" <i>Fresenius,</i> 322 F.3d at 68. Indeed, we observed that <i>Metcalf &amp; Eddy</i> \"presciently predicted the ways in which the Supreme Court would view the issue.\" <i>Id.</i> at 62.</p>\n<p>The \"reshaping\" effected in <i>Fresenius</i> was the replacement of <i>Metcalf &amp; Eddy</i>'s multi-factor test with the Supreme Court's two-part inquiry: first, the structural prong and, if necessary, the impact-on-the-treasury prong. The specific considerations remained essentially the same, however, because the <i>Metcalf &amp; Eddy</i> factors covered elements relevant to both the agency's operational autonomy and its fiscal independence.<sup>[2]</sup> Although the inquiry <span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> was not framed as a progression from one stage to the next, as in <i>Fresenius</i> and <i>Hess,</i> the same \"two key questions\" and the same types of factors informed our analysis.<sup>[3]</sup><i>Fresenius,</i> 322 F.3d at 68. Hence, <i>Fresenius</i> was not a turning point in our Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence. Rather, our course was fixed in <i>Metcalf &amp; Eddy,</i> which \"foreshadowed\" <i>Hess</i> in determining that \"when there is ambiguity from the structure about whether an entity is an arm of the state, the primary focus is on the risk to the state treasury.\" <i>Id.</i> at 66.</p>\n<p>Arguably, our conclusion that the substance of the law did not change in <i>Fresenius</i> is enough to resolve this case. We observed in <i>Metcalf &amp; Eddy</i> that \"[w]here the agency's activity and its relation to the state remain essentially the same, prior circuit precedent will be controlling.\" 991 F.2d at 940 n. 4. Indeed, the UPR has been deemed an arm of the state for more than three decades, <i>see </i><i>Pinto v. Universidad De P.R.,</i> 895 F.2d 18, 18 (1st Cir. 1990); <i>Perez v. Rodriguez Bou,</i> 575 F.2d 21, 25 (1st Cir.1978), and no factual change in its relationship with the Commonwealth is asserted. The principle of <i>stare decisis</i> thus has considerable force here.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, we recognize that the original precedent on the UPR's status predates even <i>Metcalf &amp; Eddy.</i> In addition, although we have assumed the continuing validity of that precedent at least twice since <i>Fresenius,</i> the Eleventh Amendment was not a live issue in either case. <i>See </i><i>Toledo,</i> 454 F.3d at 31 n. 1, 40 (finding that the UPR was not entitled to immunity for the particular claims at issue); <i>Aponte-Torres,</i> 445 F.3d at 53, 55 (holding that the plaintiffs \"fail[ed] to articulate a cognizable federal claim\"). Thus, like the district court, we think brief consideration of the two-part <i>Fresenius</i> inquiry is warranted to confirm that our precedent is in line with current law.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> B. Application of the Arm-of-the-State Test</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Structural Factors</h2>\n<p>The distinctive, public-oriented role that a state university typically plays in its state's higher education landscape undoubtedly accounts for the fact that \"the vast majority of state universities ... have been found to be `arms' of the State.\" <i>See </i><i>Univ. of R.I. v. A.W. Chesterton Co.,</i> 2 F.3d 1200, 1204 (1st Cir.1993); <i>see also</i> 13 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller, Edward H. Cooper &amp; Richard D. Freer, <i>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure</i> § 3524.2, at 325-32 (2008) (noting that \"state universities usually are considered arms of the state\"). Each state university nonetheless \"must be evaluated in light of its unique characteristics.\" <i>A.W. Chesterton,</i> 2 F.3d at 1204.</p>\n<p>Although Puerto Rico law contains no explicit statement of intention that the University share the Commonwealth's sovereign immunity, statutory provisions and case law together describe a public role for the University consistent with such a relationship. By statute, the UPR has an \"obligation of service to the people of Puerto Rico,\" P.R. Laws Ann., tit. 18, § 601(a), and it is exempted from the payment of taxes because it \"achieves a public purpose of the Commonwealth.\" <i>Id.</i> § 612(f).</p>\n<p>The UPR's important public role also has been acknowledged by the Puerto Rico Supreme Court. In <i>University of Puerto Rico v. Puerto Rico Association of University Professors,</i> 136 P.R. Dec. 335, No. JR-91-103 (June 13, 1994),<sup>[5]</sup> the court noted the UPR's obligation \"[a]s a university of the State ... to serve the People of Puerto Rico,\" Unoff. Trans. at 44 (quotation marks omitted), and it rejected a suggestion that the UPR could increase fees to the same extent as could a private university in order to raise revenue:</p>\n<blockquote>For evident reasons, increasing the costs of registration so substantially would create very serious problems concerning the role played by U.P.R. in Puerto Rico's society, not to mention those related to its implementation. An increase like the Board suggests, sufficiently high so as to convert the U.P.R. into a profitable operation, would cause serious problems, for example, concerning students. It would affect both the capacity of our young ones to obtain good quality higher education as well as the U.P.R.'s capacity to fulfill its statutory mission of developing the intellectual and spiritual wealth of our people, \"especially those less favored in terms of financial resources.\" 18 L.P.R.A. sec. 601(b)(4).<sup>[6]</sup></blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 45 (emphasis omitted).<sup>[7]</sup> The Commonwealth's reliance on the UPR to make <span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> higher education accessible to students for whom the government feels a special responsibility is also shown by a specific UPR tuition exemption for the children of Puerto Rico military members who have died in action, remain missing, or are prisoners of war. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 18, § 612(b).</p>\n<p>In further support of the proposition that the University is an arm of the Commonwealth, we note that ten of the thirteen members of its governing board are appointed by the governor, with the advice and consent of the Puerto Rico Senate, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 18, § 602(b)(1),<sup>[8]</sup> and the Board originally was convened by the Secretary of Education, <i>id.</i> § 602(b)(4). <i>See </i><i>Pastrana-Torres v. Corporación de P.R. para la Difusión Pública,</i> 460 F.3d 124, 127 (1st Cir.2006) (noting that Commonwealth control is indicated where board comprised of government officials and private citizens is appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Senate); <i>A.W. Chesterton Co.,</i> 2 F.3d at 1207 (noting that appointment of ten of thirteen board members by the governor with consent of Senate is \"a legislative design most courts routinely view as evidence of an entity's lack of independence from State control\") (citing cases).<sup>[9]</sup> The Board of Trustees plays a significant role in governing the University, including appointing the President and Chancellors, in consultation with academic senates, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 18, § 602(e)(7), and \"supervis[ing] the general progress of the institution,\" <i>id.</i> § 602(d). The Board also approves the university system's annual budget and the appointment of the Finance Director, and it is charged with \"[r]ender[ing] a yearly report to the Governor and the Legislature concerning its activities and the status and finances of the University.\" <i>Id.</i> § 602(e)(8), (9), (10).</p>\n<p>These structural signals strongly indicate that the Commonwealth's \"`dignity' interest as a sovereign in not being haled into federal court\" embraces the University. <i>See </i><i>Fresenius,</i> 322 F.3d at 63. Yet we acknowledge that the UPR also possesses attributes of an autonomous agency. It controls and may acquire its own properties, it may create subsidiary corporations, and its debts are by law not considered those of the Commonwealth. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 18, §§ 612(a), 602(e)(19), 612(f), 822. As appellant argues, the University has \"a significant degree of autonomy\" to set policy, <i>see id.</i> §§ 602(d), 603(a),<sup>[10]</sup> and the UPR is authorized <span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> to borrow money \"for any of its purposes and activities\" by issuing bonds or notes, <i>id.</i> § 612(e). It also has authority to raise revenue by charging tuition and other fees, <i>id.</i> § 612(b),<sup>[11]</sup> and to spend the proceeds generated from such sources, as well as from the sale of property and donations, \"in the best interest of the University,\" <i>id.</i> § 612(c). Although the University is expressly authorized to issue bonds \"for the purpose of acquiring or constructing any project,\" such revenue bonds \"shall not constitute a debt of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\" and shall not \"pledge the good faith and credit of the Commonwealth.\" <i>Id.</i> § 822.</p>\n<p>The authority to conduct day-to-day operations is not necessarily inconsistent with a conclusion that the Commonwealth intends the UPR to share its sovereign status. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Kashani v. Purdue Univ.,</i> 813 F.2d 843, 847 (7th Cir.1987) (\"[T]hese powers are granted the university only so that it is able to carry out its primary purpose of education, in contrast to a city or county, whose exercise of such powers ... is its very raison d'etre.\"). Yet, some of the structural indicators unquestionably point in the other direction. We thus think it prudent to proceed to the second stage of the Eleventh Amendment inquiry \"and consider whether the state's treasury would be at risk in the event of an adverse judgment.\" <i>Redondo Constr. Corp.,</i> 357 F.3d at 126.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Impact on the Treasury</h2>\n<p>It is undisputed that the Commonwealth provides the bulk of the funding for the University's operations. By law, the Commonwealth must dedicate 9.6% of its general fund revenues to the UPR. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 18, § 621-1. The parties debate what percentage of the University's budget those funds represent, but even appellant acknowledges that more than sixty percent of the UPR's funding comes from the government. He argues that the institution's non-government funds are \"more than sufficient\" to satisfy any judgments, asserting that in one recent year the UPR had nearly $579 million in non-Commonwealth income.<sup>[12]</sup> Appellant's calculations, however, patently overestimate the University's available resources by including funds that are identified as restricted in the budget document on which he relies. Indeed, in the reported year, 2008-2009, only about one-fifth of the non-Commonwealth funds appear to have been unrestricted,<sup>[13]</sup> leaving the Commonwealth as the source for nearly ninety percent of the University's general fund. <i>See P.R. Ass'n of Univ. Profs.,</i> 136 P.R. Dec. 335, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> Unoff. Trans. at 42 (observing that, at the time of the decision in 1994, eighty-six percent of the University's budget came from the General Fund of the Commonwealth).</p>\n<p>More importantly, however, the University's status cannot turn on whether its budget shows enough non-Commonwealth income to allow it, in theory, to pay a court judgment. Allocating any portion of the University's general fund revenues to court judgments not only would dilute the impact of the public funds the UPR receives, but such damage awards also would diminish the University's ability to comply with its statutory mission to provide \"good quality higher education\" for all residents of Puerto Rico. <i>Id.</i> at 45.<sup>[14]</sup> The UPR does not have the flexibility to offset unanticipated expenses by passing the additional costs on to its customers. <i>See id.; cf. </i><i>Metcalf &amp; Eddy,</i> 991 F.2d at 940 (\"Although the central government subsidizes the agency to some extent, [the agency] relies mostly on user fees and bonds to support its operations.\"). Because providing affordable higher education for Puerto Rico residents is the Commonwealth's goal, the Commonwealth must as a practical matter ensure the University's financial viabilityregardless of its responsibility for particular University debts. We suggested as much in <i>Fresenius,</i> where we observed that the Commonwealth may indirectly assume the obligation for an entity's debts \"by providing virtually all the funds needed for [its] operation.\" 322 F.3d at 72; <i>see also </i><i>Pastrana-Torres,</i> 460 F.3d at 128 (same); <i>Metcalf &amp; Eddy,</i> 991 F.2d at 941 (quoting <i>Blake v. Kline,</i> 612 F.2d 718, 723 (3d Cir.1979), for the proposition that \"`the nature of the state's obligation to contribute may be more important than the size of the contribution'\").</p>\n<p>In sum, the Commonwealth's investment, financial and otherwise, in the UPR's ability to fulfill its \"obligation of service to the people of Puerto Rico,\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 18, § 601(a), puts Commonwealth funds at risk when University funds are at risk. Hence, we are comfortable that our longstanding precedent remains consistent with current Eleventh Amendment principles. Accordingly, we affirm the district court's judgment dismissing this action on the ground that appellant's claims are foreclosed by the Eleventh Amendment.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The district court also rejected Irizarry's request for equitable relief under the <i>Ex Parte Young</i> doctrine, which allows prospective injunctive relief against state officers who are sued in their official capacities. <i>See </i><i>Ex Parte Young,</i> 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908); <i>Negrón-Almeda v. Santiago,</i> 579 F.3d 45, 52 (1st Cir.2009). Irizarry's suit names as a defendant only the University, not any individuals. In the absence of consent, waiver, or abrogation, the Eleventh Amendment bars suit against states themselves regardless of the form of relief sought. <i>Pennhurst State Sch. &amp; Hosp. v. Halderman,</i> 465 U.S. 89, 100, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984); <i>Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc. v. P.R. Aqueduct &amp; Sewer Auth.,</i> 991 F.2d 935, 938 (1st Cir. 1993); <i>see also </i><i>Torres-Alamo v. Puerto Rico,</i> 502 F.3d 20, 24 (1st Cir.2007) (noting that the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is treated as a state for purposes of the Eleventh Amendment). In his reply brief, Irizarry states that he does not challenge the court's ruling on injunctive relief.</p>\n<p>[2]  We listed the following seven factors in <i>Metcalf &amp; Eddy:</i>\n</p>\n<p>(1) whether the agency has the funding power to enable it to satisfy judgments without direct state participation or guarantees; (2) whether the agency's function is governmental or proprietary; (3) whether the agency is separately incorporated; (4) whether the state exerts control over the agency, and if so, to what extent; (5) whether the agency has the power to sue, be sued, and enter contracts in its own name and right; (6) whether the agency's property is subject to state taxation; and (7) whether the state has immunized itself from responsibility for the agency's acts or omissions.</p>\n<p>991 F.2d at 939-40.</p>\n<p>[3]  Under <i>Hess,</i> as described in <i>Fresenius,</i> the relevant structural considerations include:\n</p>\n<p>(1) extent of state control including through the appointment of board members and the state's power to veto board actions or enlarge the entity's responsibilities; (2) how the enabling and implementing legislation characterized the entity and how the state courts have viewed the entity; (3) whether the entity's functions are readily classifiable as state functions or local or non-governmental functions; and (4) whether the state bore legal liability for the entity's debts.</p>\n<p><i>Fresenius,</i> 322 F.3d at 65 n. 7 (citing <i>Hess,</i> 513 U.S. at 44-46, 115 S.Ct. 394).</p>\n<p>The relevant considerations on the fiscal relationship include:</p>\n<p>whether the state laws impose an obligation on the state to be responsible for payment of judgments against the entity (on this point federal courts are not free to assume that a state will voluntarily assume the payment of the entity's debts if the entity is in need); other sources of revenue for the entity; and whether the agency is so structured that, as a practical matter, the state anticipated budget shortfalls that would render the entity constantly dependent on the state.</p>\n<p><i>Fresenius,</i> 322 F.3d at 65 n. 8 (citing <i>Hess,</i> 513 U.S. at 49-50, 115 S.Ct. 394).</p>\n<p>[4]  The district court dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), although it referenced documents outside the complaint. Whether the court's ruling is treated as a dismissal under Rule 12(b) or a grant of summary judgment, our standard of review is de novo. <i>See </i><i>Wojcik v. Mass. State Lottery Comm'n,</i> 300 F.3d 92, 98 (1st Cir. 2002) (stating that application of \"the immunity doctrine under the Eleventh Amendment is a question of law that engenders <i>de novo</i> review on appeal\"). In either case, we also view the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <i>See </i><i>McCloskey v. Mueller,</i> 446 F.3d 262, 266 (1st Cir.2006) (Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6)); <i>Fresenius,</i> 322 F.3d at 68 (summary judgment).</p>\n<p>[5]  The parties stipulated to a partial translation of this case, and our citations will be to that unofficial translation.</p>\n<p>[6]  Section 601 lists the objectives of the University of Puerto Rico and directs the University to, <i>inter alia,</i>\n</p>\n<p>[f]ully develop the intellectual and spiritual wealth latent in our people, so that the values of the intelligence and spirit of the exceptional personalities that arise from all social sectors, especially those least favored in economic resources, may be put to the service of the Puerto Rican community.</p>\n<p>P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 18, § 601(b)(4).</p>\n<p>[7]  Although the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's ruling does not directly address the question of sovereign immunity and would not, in any event, be dispositive on the question, its observations are pertinent to our attempt to divine legislative intent. <i>See </i><i>Redondo Constr. Corp.,</i> 357 F.3d at 128 (noting that, \"`[w]hile not dispositive, consistent decisions of a state's highest court construing an agency's or institution's relationship with the central government are important guideposts in a reasoned attempt to locate the agency's or institution's place within the scheme of things.'\" (alteration in original) (quoting <i>Metcalf &amp; Eddy,</i> 991 F.2d at 942)).</p>\n<p>[8]  The three other members consist of one student and two faculty members, who are elected by their peers to serve one-year terms. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 18, § 602(b)(1) &amp; (2). The governor's appointees serve staggered six-year terms. <i>Id.</i> § 602(b)(2).</p>\n<p>[9]  We observed in <i>Fresenius</i> that \"[t]he governor's appointment power over the board is not enough in itself to establish that [an entity] is an arm of the state.\" 322 F.3d at 71. In fact, where, as here, the governor-appointed board members serve terms potentially longer than a governor's tenure and may \"only be discharged after determination of just cause after filing charges,\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 18, § 602(b)(2), the trustees are insulated \"to some degree\" from political pressure, and the University's independence is accordingly increased. <i>See </i><i>A.W. Chesterton Co.,</i> 2 F.3d at 1208. It remains structurally significant, however, that the University's governing authority resides primarily in individuals appointed by the governor.</p>\n<p>[10]  Section 602(d), titled \"Powers and duties,\" states that \"[t]he Board shall formulate the directives which shall govern the direction and development of the University, it shall examine and approve the general operational standards proposed by the legislative and administrative bodies of the latter, ... and shall supervise the general progress of the institution.\"\n</p>\n<p>Section 603(a) states that the University \"shall function with academic and administrative autonomy within the standards provided by this chapter and those that may be set forth in the University regulations or in resolutions of the Board of Trustees.\"</p>\n<p>[11]  As the Puerto Rico Supreme Court observed in the passage quoted above, however, the power to assess tuition and fees may as a practical matter be limited by the UPR's mission to serve \"especially those least favored in economic resources,\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 18, § 601(b)(4). <i>See P.R. Ass'n of Univ. Profs.,</i> 136 P.R. Dec. 335, Unoff. Trans. at 45.</p>\n<p>[12]  Appellant draws his figures from a document included in the appendix and titled \"University of Puerto Rico Consolidated Budget by Funding Account\" for fiscal year 2008-2009. He reports that the document was taken from the University's annual report, as published on its website. We rely on the same document.</p>\n<p>[13]  Appellant asserts that the UPR's 2008-2009 budget reports nearly $579 million in income from sources other than the Commonwealth government, or thirty-seven percent of its budget. Of that sum, however, more than $258 million was in restricted federal funds, $99 million was identified as allocated to a \"Permanent Improvement Program,\" and another $100 million of donations and self-generated revenues were labeled as restricted funds.</p>\n<p>[14]  In both <i>Fresenius</i> and <i>Metcalf &amp; Eddy,</i> we emphasized that \"a state agency cannot claim Eleventh Amendment immunity solely on the basis that judgments against it may absorb unrestricted funds donated by the state and, in that way, redound indirectly to the depletion of the state's treasury.\" <i>Metcalf &amp; Eddy,</i> 991 F.2d at 941; <i>see also </i><i>Fresenius,</i> 322 F.3d at 75. That description does not apply to the significantly different financial circumstances here. In <i>Metcalf &amp; Eddy,</i> the agency at issue received some government funding but was largely financed by user fees and bonds. 991 F.2d at 940. Similarly, in <i>Fresenius,</i> most of the agency's funding came from \"sources other than the Commonwealth's treasury.\" 322 F.3d at 72.\n</p>\n<p>Contrary to appellant's suggestion, the Commonwealth's 2009 fiscal stabilization act has no effect on our analysis as it did not change the financial relationship between the Commonwealth and the University. It excluded new revenues raised under the Act from the statutory 9.6 percent funding formula so that such revenues could be \"expressly directed to reducing the structural deficit of the Central Government.\" 2009 P.R. Laws Act No. 7, Statement of Motives (\"Special Act to Declare a State of Fiscal Emergency and to Establish a Comprehensive Fiscal Stabilization Plan to Salvage the Credit of Puerto Rico\").</p>\n\n</div>",

On appeal, the plaintiff asserts that this circuit's test for analyzing whether a public entity is an arm of the state has changed in recent years, and he argues that the University does not qualify for that status <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> under current law. Detecting no error in the court's analysis, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>We recount only briefly the underlying facts alleged in the complaint, as the details of the alleged discrimination play no role in our analysis. Plaintiff Jesús Irizarry-Mora (\"Irizarry\"), a sociologist with a Ph.D. in population planning, applied during the second semester of the 2005-2006 academic year to be an Assistant Professor at the University of Puerto Rico. He was not chosen for the position. A job announcement seeking candidates for the position of Assistant Professor of Sociology was again published during the fall semester of the next academic year. Irizarry reapplied, and he again was not selected. The individual hired for the position was thirty years old. At the time Irizarry filed this lawsuit in 2008, he was forty-eight.</p>\n<p>Irizarry alleged in his complaint that the UPR discriminated against him on the basis of his age and retaliated against him for filing discrimination charges, in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. § 623(a), (d). The University moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, asserting that the UPR is an arm of the state and thus entitled to immunity from suit in federal court under the Eleventh Amendment. <i>See </i><i>Hess v.

Univ. of P.R.,</i> No. 3:08-cv-2004-ADC, slip op. at 5 (D.P.R. Aug. 24, 2009). The court rejected Irizarry's argument that our decision in <i>Fresenius</i> had set out a \"totally new test\" for identifying an arm of the state and thus cast doubt on the validity of earlier precedent. The court further noted that the District of Puerto Rico had reexamined the UPR's status on numerous occasions after <i>Fresenius</i> and had \"declined to depart from the `well settled proposition' that the UPR is immune from suit in federal court.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Montalvo-Padilla v.

It agreed with the previous decisions in concluding that the UPR is entitled to immunity from suit in federal court. Hence, it dismissed Irizarry's action, and this appeal followed.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> II.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Legal Background</h2>\n<p>Before our 2006 decision in <i>Fresenius,</i> this court for more than a decade had assessed an entity's arm-of-the-state status under a multi-factor test that was set out in <i>Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc. v. Puerto Rico Aqueduct &amp; Sewer Authority,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"605529\"><a href=\"/opinion/605529/metcalf-eddy-inc-v-puerto-rico-aqueduct-and-sewer-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">991</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">935</span></a></span>, 939-40 (1st Cir.1993). In <i>Fresenius,</i> we examined Supreme Court decisions that had \"updated and clarified the arm-of-the-state doctrine\" in the years since <i>Metcalf &amp; Eddy</i> to determine \"whether those opinions cause us to reshape the <i>Metcalf &amp; Eddy</i> test.\" <i>Fresenius,</i> 322 F.3d at 63. Concluding that a reshaping was appropriate, <i>id.</i> at 59, we relied primarily on the Court's decision in <i>Hess</i> to reformulate our analysis as a two-part inquiry whose steps reflected the Eleventh Amendment's twin concerns for the States' dignity and their financial solvency. <i>Fresenius,</i> 322 F.3d at 63, 68. Under that \"two-stage framework,\"</p>\n<blockquote>a court must first determine whether the state has indicated an intention either explicitly by statute or implicitly through the structure of the entitythat the entity share the state's sovereign immunity. If no explicit indication exists, the court must consider the structural indicators of the state's intention. If these point in different directions, the court must proceed to the second stage and consider whether the state's treasury would be at risk in the event of an adverse judgment.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Redondo Constr. Corp. v. P.R. Highway &amp; Transp. Auth.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200844\"><a href=\"/opinion/200844/redondo-v-puerto-rico-highway/\"><span class=\"volume\">357</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">124</span></a></span>, 126 (1st Cir. 2004) (citation omitted); <i>see also </i><i>Fresenius,</i> 322 F.3d at 65-66.</p>\n<p>Appellant asserts that this evolution of the law means that arm-of-the-state determinations predating <i>Fresenius</i> are no longer binding. That argument, however, fails to recognize that we explicitly stated in <i>Fresenius</i> that the \"reshaping\" of our law did not represent an actual change in the substance of the analysis. We observed that <i>Hess</i> had \"refined\" the <i>Metcalf &amp; Eddy</i> analysis, which we described as \"consistent with <i>Hess.</i>\" <i>Fresenius,</i> 322 F.3d at 68. Indeed, we observed that <i>Metcalf &amp; Eddy</i> \"presciently predicted the ways in which the Supreme Court would view the issue.\" <i>Id.</i> at 62.</p>\n<p>The \"reshaping\" effected in <i>Fresenius</i> was the replacement of <i>Metcalf &amp; Eddy</i>'s multi-factor test with the Supreme Court's two-part inquiry: first, the structural prong and, if necessary, the impact-on-the-treasury prong. The specific considerations remained essentially the same, however, because the <i>Metcalf &amp; Eddy</i> factors covered elements relevant to both the agency's operational autonomy and its fiscal independence.<sup>[2]</sup> Although the inquiry <span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> was not framed as a progression from one stage to the next, as in <i>Fresenius</i> and <i>Hess,</i> the same \"two key questions\" and the same types of factors informed our analysis.<sup>[3]</sup><i>Fresenius,</i> 322 F.3d at 68. Hence, <i>Fresenius</i> was not a turning point in our Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence. Rather, our course was fixed in <i>Metcalf &amp; Eddy,</i> which \"foreshadowed\" <i>Hess</i> in determining that \"when there is ambiguity from the structure about whether an entity is an arm of the state, the primary focus is on the risk to the state treasury.\" <i>Id.</i> at 66.</p>\n<p>Arguably, our conclusion that the substance of the law did not change in <i>Fresenius</i> is enough to resolve this case. We observed in <i>Metcalf &amp; Eddy</i> that \"[w]here the agency's activity and its relation to the state remain essentially the same, prior circuit precedent will be controlling.\" 991 F.2d at 940 n. 4. Indeed, the UPR has been deemed an arm of the state for more than three decades, <i>see </i><i>Pinto v. Universidad De P.R.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536026\"><a href=\"/opinion/536026/desio-rabal-pinto-v-universidad-de-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 18 (1st Cir. 1990); <i>Perez v.

The principle of <i>stare decisis</i> thus has considerable force here.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, we recognize that the original precedent on the UPR's status predates even <i>Metcalf &amp; Eddy.</i> In addition, although we have assumed the continuing validity of that precedent at least twice since <i>Fresenius,</i> the Eleventh Amendment was not a live issue in either case. <i>See </i><i>Toledo,</i> 454 F.3d at 31 n. 1, 40 (finding that the UPR was not entitled to immunity for the particular claims at issue); <i>Aponte-Torres,</i> 445 F.3d at 53, 55 (holding that the plaintiffs \"fail[ed] to articulate a cognizable federal claim\"). Thus, like the district court, we think brief consideration of the two-part <i>Fresenius</i> inquiry is warranted to confirm that our precedent is in line with current law.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> B. Application of the Arm-of-the-State Test</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Structural Factors</h2>\n<p>The distinctive, public-oriented role that a state university typically plays in its state's higher education landscape undoubtedly accounts for the fact that \"the vast majority of state universities ... have been found to be `arms' of the State.\" <i>See </i><i>Univ. of R.I. v. A.W. Chesterton Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"628596\"><a href=\"/opinion/628596/university-of-rhode-island-v-aw-chesterton-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1200</span></a></span>, 1204 (1st Cir.1993); <i>see also</i> 13 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller, Edward H. Cooper &amp; Richard D. Freer, <i>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure</i> § 3524.2, at 325-32 (2008) (noting that \"state universities usually are considered arms of the state\"). Each state university nonetheless \"must be evaluated in light of its unique characteristics.\" <i>A.W. Chesterton,</i> 2 F.3d at 1204.</p>\n<p>Although Puerto Rico law contains no explicit statement of intention that the University share the Commonwealth's sovereign immunity, statutory provisions and case law together describe a public role for the University consistent with such a relationship. By statute, the UPR has an \"obligation of service to the people of Puerto Rico,\" P.R. Laws Ann., tit. 18, § 601(a), and it is exempted from the payment of taxes because it \"achieves a public purpose of the Commonwealth.\" <i>Id.</i> § 612(f).</p>\n<p>The UPR's important public role also has been acknowledged by the Puerto Rico Supreme Court. In <i>University of Puerto Rico v. Puerto Rico Association of University Professors,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Dec.</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></span>, No. JR-91-103 (June 13, 1994),<sup>[5]</sup> the court noted the UPR's obligation \"[a]s a university of the State ... to serve the People of Puerto Rico,\" Unoff. Trans. at 44 (quotation marks omitted), and it rejected a suggestion that the UPR could increase fees to the same extent as could a private university in order to raise revenue:</p>\n<blockquote>For evident reasons, increasing the costs of registration so substantially would create very serious problems concerning the role played by U.P.R. in Puerto Rico's society, not to mention those related to its implementation. An increase like the Board suggests, sufficiently high so as to convert the U.P.R. into a profitable operation, would cause serious problems, for example, concerning students. It would affect both the capacity of our young ones to obtain good quality higher education as well as the U.P.R.'s capacity to fulfill its statutory mission of developing the intellectual and spiritual wealth of our people, \"especially those less favored in terms of financial resources.\" 18 L.P.R.A. sec. 601(b)(4).<sup>[6]</sup></blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 45 (emphasis omitted).<sup>[7]</sup> The Commonwealth's reliance on the UPR to make <span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> higher education accessible to students for whom the government feels a special responsibility is also shown by a specific UPR tuition exemption for the children of Puerto Rico military members who have died in action, remain missing, or are prisoners of war. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 18, § 612(b).</p>\n<p>In further support of the proposition that the University is an arm of the Commonwealth, we note that ten of the thirteen members of its governing board are appointed by the governor, with the advice and consent of the Puerto Rico Senate, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 18, § 602(b)(1),<sup>[8]</sup> and the Board originally was convened by the Secretary of Education, <i>id.</i> § 602(b)(4). <i>See </i><i>Pastrana-Torres v. Corporación de P.R. para la Difusión Pública,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202360\"><a href=\"/opinion/202360/pastrana-torres-v-zabala-carrion/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">124</span></a></span>, 127 (1st Cir.2006) (noting that Commonwealth control is indicated where board comprised of government officials and private citizens is appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Senate); <i>A.W. Chesterton Co.,</i> 2 F.3d at 1207 (noting that appointment of ten of thirteen board members by the governor with consent of Senate is \"a legislative design most courts routinely view as evidence of an entity's lack of independence from State control\") (citing cases).<sup>[9]</sup> The Board of Trustees plays a significant role in governing the University, including appointing the President and Chancellors, in consultation with academic senates, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 18, § 602(e)(7), and \"supervis[ing] the general progress of the institution,\" <i>id.</i> § 602(d). The Board also approves the university system's annual budget and the appointment of the Finance Director, and it is charged with \"[r]ender[ing] a yearly report to the Governor and the Legislature concerning its activities and the status and finances of the University.\" <i>Id.</i> § 602(e)(8), (9), (10).</p>\n<p>These structural signals strongly indicate that the Commonwealth's \"`dignity' interest as a sovereign in not being haled into federal court\" embraces the University. <i>See </i><i>Fresenius,</i> 322 F.3d at 63. Yet we acknowledge that the UPR also possesses attributes of an autonomous agency. It controls and may acquire its own properties, it may create subsidiary corporations, and its debts are by law not considered those of the Commonwealth. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 18, §§ 612(a), 602(e)(19), 612(f), 822. As appellant argues, the University has \"a significant degree of autonomy\" to set policy, <i>see id.</i> §§ 602(d), 603(a),<sup>[10]</sup> and the UPR is authorized <span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> to borrow money \"for any of its purposes and activities\" by issuing bonds or notes, <i>id.</i> § 612(e). It also has authority to raise revenue by charging tuition and other fees, <i>id.</i> § 612(b),<sup>[11]</sup> and to spend the proceeds generated from such sources, as well as from the sale of property and donations, \"in the best interest of the University,\" <i>id.</i> § 612(c). Although the University is expressly authorized to issue bonds \"for the purpose of acquiring or constructing any project,\" such revenue bonds \"shall not constitute a debt of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\" and shall not \"pledge the good faith and credit of the Commonwealth.\" <i>Id.</i> § 822.</p>\n<p>The authority to conduct day-to-day operations is not necessarily inconsistent with a conclusion that the Commonwealth intends the UPR to share its sovereign status. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Kashani v. Purdue Univ.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"484697\"><a href=\"/opinion/484697/hamid-r-kashani-v-purdue-university/\"><span class=\"volume\">813</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">843</span></a></span>, 847 (7th Cir.1987) (\"[T]hese powers are granted the university only so that it is able to carry out its primary purpose of education, in contrast to a city or county, whose exercise of such powers ... is its very raison d'etre.\"). Yet, some of the structural indicators unquestionably point in the other direction. We thus think it prudent to proceed to the second stage of the Eleventh Amendment inquiry \"and consider whether the state's treasury would be at risk in the event of an adverse judgment.\" <i>Redondo Constr. Corp.,</i> 357 F.3d at 126.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Impact on the Treasury</h2>\n<p>It is undisputed that the Commonwealth provides the bulk of the funding for the University's operations. By law, the Commonwealth must dedicate 9.6% of its general fund revenues to the UPR. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 18, § 621-1. The parties debate what percentage of the University's budget those funds represent, but even appellant acknowledges that more than sixty percent of the UPR's funding comes from the government. He argues that the institution's non-government funds are \"more than sufficient\" to satisfy any judgments, asserting that in one recent year the UPR had nearly $579 million in non-Commonwealth income.<sup>[12]</sup> Appellant's calculations, however, patently overestimate the University's available resources by including funds that are identified as restricted in the budget document on which he relies. Indeed, in the reported year, 2008-2009, only about one-fifth of the non-Commonwealth funds appear to have been unrestricted,<sup>[13]</sup> leaving the Commonwealth as the source for nearly ninety percent of the University's general fund. <i>See P.R. Ass'n of Univ. Profs.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Dec.</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></span>, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> Unoff. Trans. at 42 (observing that, at the time of the decision in 1994, eighty-six percent of the University's budget came from the General Fund of the Commonwealth).</p>\n<p>More importantly, however, the University's status cannot turn on whether its budget shows enough non-Commonwealth income to allow it, in theory, to pay a court judgment. Allocating any portion of the University's general fund revenues to court judgments not only would dilute the impact of the public funds the UPR receives, but such damage awards also would diminish the University's ability to comply with its statutory mission to provide \"good quality higher education\" for all residents of Puerto Rico. <i>Id.</i> at 45.<sup>[14]</sup> The UPR does not have the flexibility to offset unanticipated expenses by passing the additional costs on to its customers. <i>See id.; cf. </i><i>Metcalf &amp; Eddy,</i> 991 F.2d at 940 (\"Although the central government subsidizes the agency to some extent, [the agency] relies mostly on user fees and bonds to support its operations.\"). Because providing affordable higher education for Puerto Rico residents is the Commonwealth's goal, the Commonwealth must as a practical matter ensure the University's financial viabilityregardless of its responsibility for particular University debts. We suggested as much in <i>Fresenius,</i> where we observed that the Commonwealth may indirectly assume the obligation for an entity's debts \"by providing virtually all the funds needed for [its] operation.\" 322 F.3d at 72; <i>see also </i><i>Pastrana-Torres,</i> 460 F.3d at 128 (same); <i>Metcalf &amp; Eddy,</i> 991 F.2d at 941 (quoting <i>Blake v. Kline,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"373414\"><a href=\"/opinion/373414/blake-margaret-anne-a-minor-by-blake-james-her-guardian-v-kline/\"><span class=\"volume\">612</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">718</span></a></span>, 723 (3d Cir.1979), for the proposition that \"`the nature of the state's obligation to contribute may be more important than the size of the contribution'\").</p>\n<p>In sum, the Commonwealth's investment, financial and otherwise, in the UPR's ability to fulfill its \"obligation of service to the people of Puerto Rico,\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 18, § 601(a), puts Commonwealth funds at risk when University funds are at risk. Hence, we are comfortable that our longstanding precedent remains consistent with current Eleventh Amendment principles. Accordingly, we affirm the district court's judgment dismissing this action on the ground that appellant's claims are foreclosed by the Eleventh Amendment.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The district court also rejected Irizarry's request for equitable relief under the <i>Ex Parte Young</i> doctrine, which allows prospective injunctive relief against state officers who are sued in their official capacities. <i>See </i><i>Ex Parte Young,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96819\"><a href=\"/opinion/96819/ex-parte-young/\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">123</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In his reply brief, Irizarry states that he does not challenge the court's ruling on injunctive relief.</p>\n<p>[2]  We listed the following seven factors in <i>Metcalf &amp; Eddy:</i>\n</p>\n<p>(1) whether the agency has the funding power to enable it to satisfy judgments without direct state participation or guarantees; (2) whether the agency's function is governmental or proprietary; (3) whether the agency is separately incorporated; (4) whether the state exerts control over the agency, and if so, to what extent; (5) whether the agency has the power to sue, be sued, and enter contracts in its own name and right; (6) whether the agency's property is subject to state taxation; and (7) whether the state has immunized itself from responsibility for the agency's acts or omissions.</p>\n<p>991 F.2d at 939-40.</p>\n<p>[3]  Under <i>Hess,</i> as described in <i>Fresenius,</i> the relevant structural considerations include:\n</p>\n<p>(1) extent of state control including through the appointment of board members and the state's power to veto board actions or enlarge the entity's responsibilities; (2) how the enabling and implementing legislation characterized the entity and how the state courts have viewed the entity; (3) whether the entity's functions are readily classifiable as state functions or local or non-governmental functions; and (4) whether the state bore legal liability for the entity's debts.</p>\n<p><i>Fresenius,</i> 322 F.3d at 65 n. 7 (citing <i>Hess,</i> 513 U.S. at 44-46, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117880\"><a href=\"/opinion/117880/hess-v-port-authority-trans-hudson-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Whether the court's ruling is treated as a dismissal under Rule 12(b) or a grant of summary judgment, our standard of review is de novo. <i>See </i><i>Wojcik v. Mass. State Lottery Comm'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200086\"><a href=\"/opinion/200086/wojcik-v-massachusetts-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">300</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">92</span></a></span>, 98 (1st Cir. 2002) (stating that application of \"the immunity doctrine under the Eleventh Amendment is a question of law that engenders <i>de novo</i> review on appeal\"). In either case, we also view the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <i>See </i><i>McCloskey v. Mueller,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202217\"><a href=\"/opinion/202217/mccloskey-v-mueller/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">262</span></a></span>, 266 (1st Cir.2006) (Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6)); <i>Fresenius,</i> 322 F.3d at 68 (summary judgment).</p>\n<p>[5]  The parties stipulated to a partial translation of this case, and our citations will be to that unofficial translation.</p>\n<p>[6]  Section 601 lists the objectives of the University of Puerto Rico and directs the University to, <i>inter alia,</i>\n</p>\n<p>[f]ully develop the intellectual and spiritual wealth latent in our people, so that the values of the intelligence and spirit of the exceptional personalities that arise from all social sectors, especially those least favored in economic resources, may be put to the service of the Puerto Rican community.</p>\n<p>P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 18, § 601(b)(4).</p>\n<p>[7]  Although the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's ruling does not directly address the question of sovereign immunity and would not, in any event, be dispositive on the question, its observations are pertinent to our attempt to divine legislative intent. <i>See </i><i>Redondo Constr. Corp.,</i> 357 F.3d at 128 (noting that, \"`[w]hile not dispositive, consistent decisions of a state's highest court construing an agency's or institution's relationship with the central government are important guideposts in a reasoned attempt to locate the agency's or institution's place within the scheme of things.'\" (alteration in original) (quoting <i>Metcalf &amp; Eddy,</i> 991 F.2d at 942)).</p>\n<p>[8]  The three other members consist of one student and two faculty members, who are elected by their peers to serve one-year terms. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 18, § 602(b)(1) &amp; (2). The governor's appointees serve staggered six-year terms. <i>Id.</i> § 602(b)(2).</p>\n<p>[9]  We observed in <i>Fresenius</i> that \"[t]he governor's appointment power over the board is not enough in itself to establish that [an entity] is an arm of the state.\" 322 F.3d at 71. In fact, where, as here, the governor-appointed board members serve terms potentially longer than a governor's tenure and may \"only be discharged after determination of just cause after filing charges,\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 18, § 602(b)(2), the trustees are insulated \"to some degree\" from political pressure, and the University's independence is accordingly increased. <i>See </i><i>A.W. Chesterton Co.,</i> 2 F.3d at 1208. It remains structurally significant, however, that the University's governing authority resides primarily in individuals appointed by the governor.</p>\n<p>[10]  Section 602(d), titled \"Powers and duties,\" states that \"[t]he Board shall formulate the directives which shall govern the direction and development of the University, it shall examine and approve the general operational standards proposed by the legislative and administrative bodies of the latter, ... and shall supervise the general progress of the institution.\"\n</p>\n<p>Section 603(a) states that the University \"shall function with academic and administrative autonomy within the standards provided by this chapter and those that may be set forth in the University regulations or in resolutions of the Board of Trustees.\"</p>\n<p>[11]  As the Puerto Rico Supreme Court observed in the passage quoted above, however, the power to assess tuition and fees may as a practical matter be limited by the UPR's mission to serve \"especially those least favored in economic resources,\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 18, § 601(b)(4). <i>See P.R. Ass'n of Univ. Profs.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Dec.</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></span>, Unoff. Trans. at 45.</p>\n<p>[12]  Appellant draws his figures from a document included in the appendix and titled \"University of Puerto Rico Consolidated Budget by Funding Account\" for fiscal year 2008-2009. He reports that the document was taken from the University's annual report, as published on its website. We rely on the same document.</p>\n<p>[13]  Appellant asserts that the UPR's 2008-2009 budget reports nearly $579 million in income from sources other than the Commonwealth government, or thirty-seven percent of its budget. Of that sum, however, more than $258 million was in restricted federal funds, $99 million was identified as allocated to a \"Permanent Improvement Program,\" and another $100 million of donations and self-generated revenues were labeled as restricted funds.</p>\n<p>[14]  In both <i>Fresenius</i> and <i>Metcalf &amp; Eddy,</i> we emphasized that \"a state agency cannot claim Eleventh Amendment immunity solely on the basis that judgments against it may absorb unrestricted funds donated by the state and, in that way, redound indirectly to the depletion of the state's treasury.\" <i>Metcalf &amp; Eddy,</i> 991 F.2d at 941; <i>see also </i><i>Fresenius,</i> 322 F.3d at 75. That description does not apply to the significantly different financial circumstances here. In <i>Metcalf &amp; Eddy,</i> the agency at issue received some government funding but was largely financed by user fees and bonds. 991 F.2d at 940. Similarly, in <i>Fresenius,</i> most of the agency's funding came from \"sources other than the Commonwealth's treasury.\" 322 F.3d at 72.\n</p>\n<p>Contrary to appellant's suggestion, the Commonwealth's 2009 fiscal stabilization act has no effect on our analysis as it did not change the financial relationship between the Commonwealth and the University. It excluded new revenues raised under the Act from the statutory 9.6 percent funding formula so that such revenues could be \"expressly directed to reducing the structural deficit of the Central Government.\" 2009 P.R. Laws Act No. 7, Statement of Motives (\"Special Act to Declare a State of Fiscal Emergency and to Establish a Comprehensive Fiscal Stabilization Plan to Salvage the Credit of Puerto Rico\").</p>\n\n</div>",
