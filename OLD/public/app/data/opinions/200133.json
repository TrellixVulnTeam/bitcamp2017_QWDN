Greenberg, of the Third Circuit, sitting\nby designation.\n\f            Greenburg, Senior Circuit Judge.       This case comes on\n\nbefore this court on appeal from a July 13, 2000 memorandum and\n\norder of the district court entering a judgment of acquittal for\n\ndefendants-appellees John Moran and Nora Moran after their jury\n\nconvictions for bank fraud and conspiracy to commit bank fraud\n\nunder 18 U.S.C. §§ 1344 and 371.    Granting appellees' Fed. R. Crim.\n\nP. 29 motions one year after the jury returned the verdicts, the\n\ncourt concluded that the evidence the government submitted in its\n\ncase-in-chief was insufficient to sustain the convictions.          The\n\ngovernment challenges that determination on appeal, arguing that\nthe district court erred in failing to consider the full trial\n\nrecord before granting the motions.     The government contends that\nthe evidence, viewed in its totality and with all reasonable\ninferences drawn in the government's favor as the verdict winner,\n\nsupported a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that the Morans each\nknowingly engaged and conspired to engage in a scheme to defraud a\nfederally   insured   banking   institution   by   actively   concealing\n\nmaterial information concerning their outside interests in Boston\nreal-estate development projects secured by two loans made by the\ninstitution.    For the reasons set forth below, we agree with the\n\ngovernment and will reverse the judgment of the district court,\nreinstate the guilty verdicts, and remand the case to the district\ncourt for further proceedings.\n\n\n\n                           I.    BACKGROUND\n\n            A brief summary of the salient facts follows, though we\n\n                                  -2-\n\freserve making a more detailed exposition until we set forth our\n\nlegal analysis.      This appeal grows out of a superseding indictment\n\ncharging the Morans with bank fraud and conspiracy in connection\nwith   two   loans   the   First   American     Bank   for   Savings      (First\n\nAmerican), a federally insured institution, made in December 1986\n\nto real-estate developers Edgar Puente and David Boersner.                Puente\nand Boersner needed financing for two renovation projects seeking\n\nto transform brownstone and apartment buildings on Commonwealth\n\nAvenue and in West Rutland Square in Boston into condominiums.\n\n             John Moran, who for many years on numerous occasions had\n\nrepresented First American as a conveyancing attorney, met with\n\nPuente and Boersner in October 1986 to discuss serving as their\n\nmortgage broker.       Puente and Boersner hired John Moran in that\ncapacity under the self-styled \"Moran Holdings,\" agreeing to pay\n\nhim a fee equal to 1.5% of any loans he successfully procured for\n\ntheir projects.      John Moran subsequently arranged and attended a\nmeeting   with   Puente,   Boersner,      and   a   loan   officer   at    First\n\nAmerican, Edmund Noke, which culminated in the parties' agreeing\n\nthat First American would extend two loans totaling $17 million to\n\nPuente and Boersner in exchange for a 40% profit interest in the\n\ndevelopment projects.      The parties further agreed that John Moran\n\nwould act as the closing attorney for the bank on the loans.                In a\n\nseparate agreement, not involving Noke, Puente and Boersner agreed\n\nto give John Moran a 20% profit interest in the projects to be held\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fby the Moran Development Group (MDG) Trust, established by Nora\n\nMoran, its sole trustee, on December 15, 1986.1\n\n          Nora Moran, who at all times relevant to this appeal was\na real-estate broker and the wife of John Moran, was on the Board\n\nof Directors of First American, having assumed the office on August\n\n21, 1986.2   First American had adopted a Code of Professional\nEthics in 1979 requiring, inter alia, that an officer or director\n\ndisclose any direct or indirect financial interest in a bank loan\n\nand disqualify him or herself from participating in the approval\n\nprocess for any such loan.   This requirement was consistent with\n\nRegulation \"O\" of the Federal Reserve Board, 12 C.F.R. § 215,\n\nwhich, pursuant to 12 U.S.C. § 375a(10), requires interested\n\ndirectors to disclose fully any personal financial stake   or that\nof their related entities in a given loan and prohibits them from\n\nparticipating directly or indirectly in any vote to extend such\n\ncredit.   The regulation also requires banks to keep records of\ninsider loans to directors, officers, and their related interests\n\nand to report annually all insider loans to federal regulators.\n\nSee 12 C.F.R. §§ 215.7 and 215.9.\n\n          In November 1986, the Morans, Noke, Puente, Boersner, and\n\na representative of Contractors Funding Corporation, a company\n\n\n     1\n      John Moran's interest was 20% of the share retained by Puente\nand Boersner, or 12% of the total profit interest.\n     2\n      Nora Moran was a trustee of the bank from March 1985 until\nJuly 1986, when it changed its organizational structure to provide,\ninter alia, that it would have a Board of Directors rather than a\nBoard of Trustees.      We use the terms trustee and director\ninterchangeably.\n\n                               -4-\n\fspecializing   in    construction      inspection       services,    visited   the\n\nCommonwealth Avenue and West Rutland Square project sites.                     John\n\nMoran subsequently submitted formal, written proposals on behalf of\nPuente and Boersner seeking non-recourse loans for the projects\n\n(which, as opposed to recourse loans, insulate borrowers from\n\npersonal liability for the amount of the loans).                    The proposals\ncarried the name Moran Holdings and were signed by John Moran, but\n\ndid not mention his brokerage or profit arrangement with Puente and\n\nBoersner.\n\n            Noke sent memoranda summarizing the loan proposals to\n\nFirst American's Executive Committee in December 1986, as all loans\n\nfor amounts greater than $500,000 required its approval.                    These\n\nmemoranda   did     not   mention    John     Moran's    brokerage     or   profit\narrangement with Puente and Boersner.               The Executive Committee\n\napproved the loans on a recourse basis on December 17, and they\n\nclosed on December 23 and 24.3         John Moran represented the bank at\nthe closings, charging $35,500 for his services although he in fact\n\ncollected only $30,500 on the fee.             He also received $255,000 in\n\nmortgage    brokerage     fees      from     the   proceeds   of     the    loans.\n\nFurthermore, John Moran kept an additional $52,000 in bank funds in\n\nhis checking account, which should have been disbursed at the\n\nclosings.\n\n     3\n      Though it is not essential to our analysis that we do so, we\nnote that the district court cited the discrepant closing date of\nDecember 26 for the Commonwealth Avenue project loan, by way of\nreference to documentation submitted by John Moran to the bank in\nJanuary 1988.   The parties agree and all the other evidence on\nrecord indicates, however, that the loan closed on December 24,\n1986.\n\n                                       -5-\n\f            On January 15, 1987, the Board of Directors, with Nora\n\nMoran in attendance, met to consider an agenda which included a\n\nreport of the Executive Committee's activities for December 1986.\nMinutes from a December 17 meeting of the Executive Committee show\n\nthat two    votes    were    taken,    one       approving      140   loans     totaling\n\n$31,098,750 and another approving 13 additional loans totaling\n$58,961,000 with the Puente/Boersner loans included in the latter\n\ngroup.   The Executive Committee's report to the Board, however,\n\nincluded details      concerning       only      the    vote    on    the    140     loans.\n\nNevertheless, the government argued at trial and argues on this\n\nappeal that the Board voted to approve the Puente/Boersner loans at\n\nthe   January   15    meeting        and    that       Nora    Moran,       rather     than\n\ndisqualifying herself because of her financial interest, voted in\nfavor of the loans.           Notwithstanding their dispute over what\n\nhappened at the Board meeting on January 15, 1987, the parties\n\nagree that Nora Moran never disclosed to any employee, officer, or\nagent of First American her husband's status as the mortgage broker\n\nfor Puente and Boersner or his profit interest in their development\n\nprojects.\n\n            Following       the    closings,       John       Moran    did    not      file\n\nsettlement statements with the bank, forms customarily signed by\n\nall the parties and submitted within 30 days accounting for the use\n\nof the loan proceeds.             Moreover, he did not submit any records\n\ndocumenting his mortgage brokerage arrangement, his 20% interest in\n\nthe project, or his retention of the additional $52,000 in bank\n\nfunds.   Furthermore, he did not disclose that he used a portion of\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fthat money in April 1987 to pay off a loan that Puente and Boersner\n\nhad secured from Olympic International Bank & Trust Company (where\n\nJohn Moran served as a director) as a down payment towards the\npurchase of the West Rutland Square property.\n\n              In    1988,    First    American       vice   president   and   general\n\ncounsel Michael Hanson reviewed the files on the Puente/Boersner\nprojects because the loans were not performing4 satisfactorily and\n\ndiscovered that the settlement statements were missing.                       After he\n\neventually obtained copies of the statements, Hanson realized that\n\nsignatures were absent from them and that balances were unaccounted\n\nfor.        He learned also that John Moran had received mortgage\n\nbrokerage fees from the loan proceeds.                   Finally, Hanson discovered\n\nthat       John    Moran    had   obtained      a    20%    profit   stake    in    the\nPuente/Boersner projects which he expected to satisfy by securing\n\na   penthouse        apartment       in   one       of   the   buildings.          These\n\nunderstandably disturbing revelations caused Hanson to contact the\nbank's outside attorneys, the firm of Warner & Stackpole, regarding\n\nthe Puente/Boersner loans.\n\n              On May 3, 1988, Warner & Stackpole attorneys Stanley\n\nRagalevsky and Samuel Adams met with John Moran and Nora Moran for\n\napproximately two hours. According to the memorandum regarding the\n\nmeeting that Ragalevsky and Adams submitted to First American after\n\nthe Morans approved it, Nora Moran admitted that she had been aware\n\nof her husband's brokerage and profit arrangement by the time the\n\n\n       4\n      In banking jargon, when required payments are not made on a\nloan it is said to be \"performing\" unsatisfactorily.\n\n                                          -7-\n\floans were approved.   She also admitted that she never volunteered\n\nthis information to anyone at the bank, believing that her husband\n\nhad made the appropriate disclosures.      John Moran claimed that he\nhad made full disclosure of his interest in the ventures to Noke\n\nand had given up his interest in the properties.      As a consequence\n\nof the disclosures in the memorandum and the facts revealed by the\nrelated investigation, Nora Moran was asked to resign her director\n\nposition from the First American Bancorp, Inc., the bank's holding\n\ncompany to which she had moved from the bank proper.        The Board of\n\nDirectors of Bancorp accepted her resignation on June 30, 1988. By\n\nOctober 1990, First American failed and was closed by the FDIC.\n\n          On July 9, 1997, a grand jury returned a superseding\n\nindictment against John and Nora Moran for bank fraud under 18\nU.S.C. § 1344, aiding and abetting bank fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 2,\n\nand conspiracy to commit bank fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 371.5\n\nSpecifically, counts two and three of the indictment charged that\nJohn Moran as a closing attorney for First American and Nora Moran\n\nas a director of First American committed fraud when, though duty-\n\nbound to do so, they failed to disclose their material profit\n\ninterest in the projects when the $17 million mortgage loans were\n\nissued.   With   respect   to   the   conspiracy,   count   one   of   the\n\nindictment alleged a number of overt acts, including the formation\n\n     5\n      The Morans do not claim that the ten-year statute of\nlimitations for bank fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1344 had run by the\ntime of the indictment. See 18 U.S.C. § 3293. In this regard we\npoint out that the indictment charges only acts the prosecution of\nwhich had not been barred by the previously applicable five-year\nstatute of limitations as of August 1989. See Pub.L. No. 101-73 §\n961(l)(3)).\n\n                                 -8-\n\fof    the   MDG    Trust.     The     two    substantive      bank    fraud     counts\n\ncorresponded to the two bank loans, and the conspiracy count\n\ncovered conduct from October 1986 to June 1988.                      The indictment\nalso contained an unrelated fourth count of bank fraud against Nora\n\nMoran in connection with her alleged involvement with a loan made\n\nby First American to finance the purchase of a property located on\nMarlborough Street in Boston.\n\n             The trial commenced on May 17, 1999.                In its case-in-\n\nchief, which lasted 24 days, the government presented evidence\n\npurporting        to   demonstrate    that    John    Moran    fraudulently        had\nexploited his position as the bank's closing attorney with respect\n\nto    the   Puente/Boersner        projects    by    failing    to    disclose     his\n\nfinancial interest in them.            In particular, the evidence showed\nthat First American's records, including Noke's memoranda to the\n\nExecutive Committee, did not reflect any disclosure by John Moran\n\nof his brokerage arrangement with Puente and Boersner or his profit\ninterest in the properties.            For example, the closing settlement\n\nstatements, which notably John Moran did not sign, indicated only\n\nthat he received legal fees.           Further, the record did not contain\n\nany   documentary       evidence     disclosing      his   status    as   MDG    Trust\n\nbeneficiary.\n\n             Significantly, Noke testified in the government's case\n\nthat John Moran did not inform him of his economic interest in the\nPuente/Boersner projects before the loans were submitted to the\nExecutive Committee for approval. Noke claimed that if he duly had\n\nbeen notified he would have prepared an insider transaction report\n\n                                        -9-\n\ffor the bank; no such report was introduced at trial.        Ragalevsky\n\nand Adams testified that regardless of his possible disclosure to\n\nNoke, John Moran was required to notify upper level management in\nwriting of his financial stake in the projects to satisfy his\n\nprofessional   duty   as   the   bank's   attorney;   no   such   written\n\ndisclosure was introduced at trial.       The government also elicited\ntestimony from a number of other witnesses on the nature of the\n\nprofessional duties John Moran owed to First American, as well as\n\nJohn Moran's own testimony from another trial acknowledging the\n\nethical and legal duties of a fiduciary.\n\n          Government witnesses described with respect to Nora Moran\n\nthe duties a director owes to a bank, such as that of full and fair\n\ndisclosure of any facts material to the bank's interests.             The\ngovernment also introduced evidence demonstrating her involvement\n\nin the Puente/Boersner loans (visiting the project sites and\n\nexecuting the MDG Trust document) and her failure to inform any\nbank official of her husband's outside interests regarding the\n\nproperties.    Further, the government attempted to show that Nora\nMoran voted to approve the loans at the January 15, 1987 Board of\n\nDirectors meeting on the theory that it was routine practice for\n\nloans approved by the Executive Committee to be submitted to the\nBoard of Directors for ratification or modification.\n\n          At the close of the government's case, the Morans made\nmotions for judgments of acquittal under Fed. R. Crim. P. 29.         The\n\n\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fcourt granted Nora Moran's motion with respect to count four,6 but\ndenied the motions as to the remaining counts.               In the defense\n\ncase,      John   Moran   testified   to   having   made   full   and   timely\ndisclosure of his outside pecuniary interest in the bank loans to\n\nNoke.      John Moran also testified that in November 1986, he had\n\nengaged in a similar transaction in which he functioned as the\nclosing attorney for First American and nevertheless received a\n\n$100,000 finder's fee from the borrower.            He claimed that he had\n\ndisclosed this earlier conflict of interest to William Collins, the\n\nbank's loan officer on the November 1986 loan.\n\n              On cross-examination, John Moran indicated that he had\n\nsent a check for $18,750 to his wife via her real estate company on\n\nJanuary 15, 1987, the very day of the Board of Directors meeting at\nissue in this case.       John Moran did not indicate on the check what\n\nthe payment represented, though it was his common practice to do\n\nso. The government sought to demonstrate that the Morans routinely\ncommingled their business finances during the relevant time period.\n\nNora Moran presented only one witness in her defense, an economics\nexpert who discussed the general banking and real estate climate\n\nduring the relevant time period.             The government called William\n\nCollins as its rebuttal witness.             He testified that he had no\nrecollection of the November 1986 loan about which John Moran\ntestified or of any disclosure John Moran made as to his finder's\nfee.\n\n\n       6\n      The judgment of acquittal on count four is not before us on\nappeal.\n\n                                      -11-\n\f            At the close of all the evidence, the Morans again moved\n\nfor judgments of acquittal.          The court reserved its ruling and\n\ncharged the jury which, on July 14, 1999, returned guilty verdicts\non the three remaining counts against the Morans.               Thereafter, the\n\nMorans filed post-trial motions under Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(c)\n\nseeking judgments of acquittal.               The district court received\nmemoranda and draft transcripts from all parties and on July 13,\n\n2000, on the basis of the submissions issued the decision and order\n\nfrom which the government appeals, entering a judgment of acquittal\n\non all counts for want of evidentiary support.             The court made its\n\nruling considering only the evidence introduced on the government's\n\ndirect case rather than on the full trial record, citing to Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 29(b), which mandates that a court revisiting a reserved\nmotion    for    judgment   of   acquittal    may    consider     only   evidence\n\nintroduced as of the time that the court reserved ruling on the\n\nmotion.\n\n            The court concluded that Noke's testimony and the absence\n\nof bank records documenting John Moran's timely disclosure of his\nbrokerage and profit arrangement could not sustain John Moran's\n\nconvictions on the substantive bank fraud counts as the defense\n\nsuccessfully had demonstrated defects in Noke's memory and work\nperformance and in First American's record-keeping practices.                 The\ncourt further concluded that the government failed to show that\nNora Moran participated in any vote on or otherwise facilitated the\n\napproval    of    the   Puente/Boersner      loans   and   that    the   evidence\ntherefore was insufficient to sustain the verdicts convicting her\n\n                                     -12-\n\fof substantive bank fraud.             The court did not consider an aiding\n\nand abetting theory of liability.                 Finally, the court concluded\n\nthat the government's failure to prove the underlying substantive\noffenses was fatal to the conspiracy convictions of both Morans.\n\nThe government timely filed a notice of appeal on August 10, 2000.\n\nWe have jurisdiction over an appeal from a final judgment of the\ndistrict court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291 and 18 U.S.C. § 3731,7\n\nand   the   district     court   exercised        subject    matter     jurisdiction\n\npursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3231.\n\n                                 II.    DISCUSSION\n\n                    A.    Standard and Scope of Review\n\n            We review Rule 29 determinations de novo.                  United States\n\nv. Carroll, 105 F.3d 740, 742 (1st Cir. 1997).                     At both the trial\n\nand   appellate    level,    a   court      must    determine       \"whether,    after\n\nassaying    all   the    evidence      in   the    light    most    amiable     to   the\n\ngovernment, and taking all reasonable inferences in its favor, a\n\n\n      7\n      18 U.S.C. § 3731 provides for appellate jurisdiction over an\nappeal brought by the government in a criminal case from an order\nof a district court dismissing an indictment or information or\ngranting a new trial after verdict or judgment. Though the statute\nin terms does not refer to appeals from orders entering a judgment\nof acquittal, the Supreme Court has interpreted section 3731 as\nallowing government appeals in criminal cases \"whenever the\nConstitution would permit.\" United States v. Wilson, 420 U.S. 332,\n337, 95 S.Ct. 1013, 1019 (1975). Here, double jeopardy principles\ndo not bar appeal by the government because the district court\ngranted the Rule 29 motions after the jury rendered a guilty\nverdict and the district court will be able to implement our\nconclusion that the judgment of acquittal was improper simply by\nentering a judgment on the verdict on remand rather than by\nrequiring the Morans to submit to trial for a second time. See\nUnited States v. Scott, 437 U.S. 82, 91 n.7, 98 S.Ct. 2187, 2194\nn.7 (1978).\n\n                                         -13-\n\frational factfinder could find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the\n\nprosecution successfully proved the essential elements of the\n\ncrime.\"      United States v. O'Brien, 14 F.3d 703, 706 (1st Cir.\n\n1994). Under this formulation, a court considers all the evidence,\n\ndirect and circumstantial, and resolves all evidentiary conflicts\n\nin favor of the verdict.          Carroll, 105 F.3d at 742.    Thus, we do\nnot weigh the credibility of the witnesses or \"assess whether the\n\nprosecution     succeeded    in     eliminating   every   possible    theory\n\nconsistent with the defendant's innocence.\"               United States v.\n\nRivera-Ruiz, 244 F.3d 263, 266 (1st Cir. 2001) (internal quotation\n\nindication omitted).        Accordingly, as long as the guilty verdict\n\nfinds support in a \"plausible rendition of the record,\" it must\n\nstand.     United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 711 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n             We deal initially with the procedural issue attributable\nto the district court's anchoring its analysis in the record as it\nexisted at the end of the government's case-in-chief.                In this\nregard we hold that our review should encompass the record of the\n\nentire trial rather than being confined only to the direct evidence\npresented by the government.          Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(b) permits a\ncourt to reserve deciding a motion for judgment of acquittal until\n\nafter a jury renders its verdict; if the court chooses to do so,\nwhen revisiting the motion it may consider only the record as it\n\nstood at the time it reserved its ruling.8\n\n     8\n         Rule 29 (a) and (b) read in full:\n\n     (a) MOTION BEFORE SUBMISSION TO JURY. Motions for\n     directed verdict are abolished and motions for judgment\n\n                                      -14-\n\f            The district court, however, denied rather than reserved\n\nits ruling on the Morans' initial Rule 29 motions with respect to\n\ncounts one through three at the close of the government's case.\nThe Morans then introduced evidence, and the government introduced\n\nadditional evidence in rebuttal. At the close of trial, the Morans\n\nagain made Rule 29 motions on which the court did reserve its\nruling, allowing it to act substantively on the motions after the\n\njury returned its verdict.       At that point the court could not act\n\non   the   original    motions   for    acquittal   adjudicated    after   the\n\ngovernment's case-in-chief and thus was required to consider the\n\nfull   record   when    acting   on    the    Morans'   second   motions   for\n\nacquittal.\n\n            We are satisfied that simply by labeling its post-trial\nRule 29 ruling as a reconsideration and reversal of its earlier\n\n\n\n       of acquittal shall be used in their place. The court on\n       motion of a defendant or of its own motion shall order\n       the entry of judgment of acquittal of one or more\n       offenses charged in the indictment or information after\n       the evidence on either side is closed if the evidence is\n       insufficient to sustain a conviction of such offense or\n       offenses. If a defendant's motion for judgment of\n       acquittal at the close of the evidence offered by the\n       government is not granted, the defendant may offer\n       evidence without having reserved the right.\n\n       (b) RESERVATION OF DECISION ON MOTION. The court may\n       reserve decision on a motion for judgment of acquittal,\n       proceed with the trial (where the motion is made before\n       the close of all the evidence), submit the case to the\n       jury and decide the motion either before the jury returns\n       a verdict or after it returns a verdict of guilty or is\n       discharged without having returned a verdict. If the\n       court reserves decision, it must decide the motion on the\n       basis of the evidence at the time the ruling was\n       reserved.\n\n                                       -15-\n\fRule 29 ruling, the court could not relate back the time when it\n\nreserved its ruling on the motions made at the end of all the\n\nevidence to the point at which it denied the first motions for\nacquittal.        After all, if it could do so it effectively would\n\ncircumvent the explicit requirement in Rule 29(b) that if a court\n\n\"reserves decision, it must decide the motion on the basis of the\nevidence at the time the ruling was reserved.\"                   Moreover, if the\n\ncourt     could   deny     a    motion   for   acquittal    at   the       end   of   the\n\ngovernment's case-in-chief and then grant it on reconsideration, as\n\na practical matter there would be no distinction between denying a\n\nmotion for acquittal or reserving a ruling on it for either way the\n\ncourt subsequently could grant the motion on a static record.\n\n             B.    Bank Fraud Charges Against John Moran (Counts Two\n                   and Three)\n\n             To    prove       bank   fraud    under   18   U.S.C.     §    1344,     the\n\ngovernment must show that the defendants: (1) engaged in a scheme\n\nor artifice to defraud or obtain money by means of materially false\n\nstatements or misrepresentations; (2) from a federally insured\n\nfinancial institution; and, (3) did so knowingly. United States v.\n\nKenrick, 221 F.3d 19, 30 (1st Cir.) (en banc), cert. denied, 531\n\nU.S. 1042, 121 S.Ct. 639 (2000).9                 We have defined \"intent to\n\n\n     9\n         The bank fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1344, provides:\n\n     Whoever knowingly executes, or attempts to execute, a\n     scheme or artifice--\n\n                    (1) to defraud a financial institution;\n             or\n\n                                         -16-\n\fdefraud\" as \"an intent to deceive the bank in order to obtain from\n\nit money or other property.\" Id. In general, ascertaining whether\n\na scheme is fraudulent \"is measured in a particular case by\ndetermining   whether   the   scheme   demonstrated   a    departure   from\n\nfundamental honesty, moral uprightness, or fair play and candid\n\ndealings in the general life of the community.\"           United States v.\n\nBrandon, 17 F.3d 409, 424 (1st Cir. 1994) (quoting United States\n\nv. Goldblatt, 813 F.2d 619, 624 (3d Cir. 1987)).           We look to the\n\nentire circumstances of the defendants' conduct and any inferences\n\ndrawn therefrom as an indication of their intent.          See Id. at 425.\n\nFurthermore, the bank need not be the immediate victim of the\n\nfraudulent scheme and need not have suffered actual loss so long as\n\nthe requisite intent is established and the bank was exposed to a\nrisk of loss.   See United States v. Barrett, 178 F.3d 643, 648 (2d\n\nCir. 1999); see also United States v. Blasini-Lluberas, 169 F.3d\n\n57, 65 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"The government need not prove actual loss\nas a result of the scheme . . . .\").          We also note that each\n\ndistinct execution of a scheme to defraud constitutes a separate\nindictable offense, for instance where, as here, the government\n\ncharges that multiple and separate loans were obtained to finance\n\n\n\n\n               (2) to obtain any of the money, funds,\n          credits, assets, securities, or other property\n          owned by, or under the custody or control of,\n          a financial institution, by means of false or\n          fraudulent pretenses, representations, or\n          promises;\n\n     shall be fined not more than $1,000,000 or imprisoned not\n     more than 30 years, or both.\n\n                                  -17-\n\fmultiple and separate real estate transactions.            Brandon, 17 F.3d\n\nat 422.\n\n            Considering the evidence in the light most favorable to\n\nthe government and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of\nthe verdict, we conclude that a jury well could have found beyond\n\na reasonable doubt that John Moran knowingly executed a scheme to\n\ndefraud     First   American.     As     its    closing   attorney   on     the\n\nPuente/Boersner loans, he had a duty to represent its interests\nwhich, at the absolute nadir of potential discharge, required him\n\nto inform the bank that as the mortgage broker he stood to reap\n1.5% of any successfully borrowed amounts.                See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. De La Mata, 266 F.3d 1275, 1293 (11th Cir. 2001) (bank\nofficials owe a fiduciary duty to the bank and its depositors,\nwhich obligates the avoidance of fraud, bad faith, usurpation of\ncorporate    opportunities,     and    self-dealing);     United   States   v.\nSilvano, 812 F.2d 754, 759 (1st Cir. 1987).                Likewise, he was\nrequired to disclose his divergent profit stake in the real-estate\n\nprojects that the loans financed.10            There was ample evidence for\n\n     10\n      We emphasize that section 1344 by its literal terms\nproscribes the knowing execution or attempted execution of a scheme\nto defraud a financial institution. Accordingly, bank fraud can be\nproven even if the defendant does not owe a pre-existing disclosure\nduty   to   the  bank.      Thus,   evidence   of  an   affirmative\nmisrepresentation, half-truth, or omission of material information\nmade knowingly to a bank to beguile an economic boon from it in\nitself will suffice to support a conviction.       As explained in\nUnited States v. Colton, 231 F.3d 890, 898-903 (4th Cir. 2000),\nfederal bank fraud, consistent with its statutory purpose, extends\nto active concealment even in the absence of a fiduciary,\nstatutory, or other independent legal duty of disclosure where the\ndefendant acts with the requisite intent to mislead or deceive.\nWhile the existence of the defendant's independent duty to the\n\n                                      -18-\n\fthe jury to conclude that John Moran was aware of his professional\n\nresponsibilities but did not meet them.\n\n          Noke, the loan officer who represented the bank in the\n\ntransactions, testified that he did not recall John Moran making\n\nany disclosures concerning his two-fold financial arrangement with\n\nPuente and Boersner.   His lack of recollection is notable for two\n\nreasons: (1) circumstances where the bank's closing attorney also\n\nfunctioned as a mortgage broker for and co-partner with the bank's\n\nclients in the same transaction were rare, and the jury reasonably\n\ncould have balanced this unusual circumstance against the fact that\nnothing about the Puente/Boersner loans stood out in Noke's mind;\n\n(2) insider arrangements of this nature typically triggered greater\n\nscrutiny and generated special paperwork. Accordingly, the absence\nof bank records documenting John Moran's outside arrangements was\n\nanother factor that the jury could take into account in concluding\n\nthat he had concealed the details of his relationship with Puente\nand Boersner.11   Moreover, in contrast the government introduced\n\n\ninstitution is a factor to be considered in evaluating the\nprosecution's case, for instance with respect to the defendant's\nstate of mind (a bank director or a bank attorney would be harder\npressed to claim good faith than an unseasoned layperson),\nultimately proof of a knowing \"scheme or artifice to defraud\" --\nwhether executed by affirmative acts or omissions -- is all that\nthe statute requires for conviction.\n     11\n      It is also significant that, although he testified, John\nMoran did not introduce at trial any records documenting his\nalleged disclosure.    Notwithstanding the passage of time, the\nrelocation of offices, or the intervention of allegedly calamitous\nnatural events, one might reasonably expect that John Moran would\nhave been careful to retain copies of any documents disclosing to\nbank officials his outside dealings with Puente and Boersner\nconsidering the intense scrutiny to which the loans were subjected\n\n                               -19-\n\finsider    loan       records   from    June   1986   showing    that   Elizabeth\n\nFinnegan, a trustee of First American, disclosed her financial\n\ninterest   as     a    principal   in    American     Healthways,   Inc.    d/b/a\nNightingale before a vote was taken to consider increasing the\n\ncompany's line of credit.\n\n            The       Morans,   particularly     John   Moran,    mounted   three\n\nprincipal lines of attack against the government's non-disclosure\n\ntheory: (1) many of the bank's records from the relevant time\n\nperiod were in disarray or missing; (2) Noke's testimony was\n\nundermined to the extent that he could not recall significant\ndetails about the transactions or participants in question and by\n\nthe fact that nearly 10 years had passed from the time that the\n\nloans were closed; (3) John Moran testified that he had made the\nappropriate disclosures.           The last fact is critical.           Though a\n\ncriminal defendant by right may opt to testify, see 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3481; Rock v. Arkansas, 483 U.S. 44, 51-53, 107 S.Ct. 2704, 2709\n(1987), he does so at his or her own peril.                 See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Dunnigan, 507 U.S. 87, 93-98, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 1116-19\n(1993).\n\n            The government discredited John Moran's testimony that he\nhad disclosed his $100,000 finder's fee from the November 1986 loan\nfor which he also represented First American at closing by calling\n\n\nwithin approximately one year from their approval. Certainly the\nfact that Nora Moran was asked to resign her director position in\nthe spring of 1988 pursuant to the independent findings of outside\ncounsel strongly would have forewarned John Moran of the utility of\npreserving with painstaking care any exculpatory documents in his\npossession.\n\n                                        -20-\n\fin rebuttal the loan officer involved who, like Noke, did not\n\nrecall John Moran making any disclosure of a conflict of interest.\n\nThat testimony, coupled with the unique vantage of the jury to\nassess    John     Moran's   demeanor         and   make    key    credibility\n\ndeterminations concerning his veracity and attention to detail as\n\nmeasured against the lack of independent corroboration for his\ntestimony, permitted the jury, on balance, to disbelieve John Moran\n\non the one hand and credit Noke on the other irrespective of any\n\ngaps or arguable inconsistencies in Noke's testimony.               See, e.g.,\n\nUnited    States   v.   Romero,   32    F.3d   641,   646   (1st   Cir.   1994)\n\n(appellate court does not secondguess the jury's decision to credit\n\ntestimony which contains an inconsistency because it \"would usurp\n\nthe jury's role to reject its decision to believe or disbelieve a\nwitness because of such inconsistencies\").12\n\n            Inasmuch as a jury could conclude that John Moran failed\n\nto disclose his broker relationship with Puente and Boersner and\nhis interest in their projects, the record supports a conclusion\n\nthat John Moran refrained from making the disclosures knowingly,\n\naffirmatively, and with a clear motive to secure a financial\n\nwindfall at the bank's potential expense. As an attorney for First\n\nAmerican, John Moran was positioned uniquely to expedite the\n\nprocess by which Puente and Boersner could obtain financing for\n\ntheir development projects, for instance by bypassing conventional\n\nbureaucratic impediments to arrange critical meetings with bank\n\n     12\n      We reiterate that the district court failed to consider John\nMoran's testimony or the government's rebuttal case in its analysis\nwhen granting the motions for acquittal.\n\n                                       -21-\n\floan officials and inspections of the properties.                       At the same\n\ntime, as an experienced real estate attorney, John Moran was well\n\naware       that   disclosure    of    his   dual,   conflicting    broker-client\nrelationship with the loan principals and of his direct interest in\n\nthe     profits      generated    by    their    development     projects     could\n\njeopardize his stake in the venture.13               In fact, the considerable\nextent to which John Moran stood to benefit from the loans --\n\n$250,000 in broker fees and 20% of profits -- is further probative\n\nof    his      motive      to    conceal     facts    that   were       potentially\n\noutcome-determinative with respect to approval of the loans.\n\n               Support for a conclusion that John Moran deliberately and\n\ndeceptively concealed material information is supplied also by the\n\nactive steps he took to eliminate a paper trail connecting himself\nto    the    loans   and   thereby     avert    inquiry   from   bank    officials.\n\nSpecifically, John Moran recruited his wife to function as the only\n\ndeclarant-trustee on the MDG Trust which, being a Massachusetts\nBusiness Trust, does not disclose as a matter of public record the\n\nidentity of its beneficiaries.               Thus, John Moran was not linked\n\nclearly to the entity. When Puente and Boersner created the Boston\n\nCommonwealth Trust and the 76-82 Rutland Square Trust to collect\n\n\n       13\n      That is to say, the information was material because had it\nbeen known that John Moran's legal representation was presumptively\npartial and hence suspect, the bank might have taken steps to\nprotect itself from the very real likelihood of legal action or\nregulatory liability, for instance by delaying the approval of the\nloans until a further independent investigation of the loans could\nbe conducted.    See Neder v. United States, 527 U.S. 1, 16, 119\nS.Ct. 1827, 1837 (1999) (an omission is material if it is \"capable\nof influencing the decision of the decisionmaking body\") (citations\nand internal punctuation omitted).\n\n                                         -22-\n\fthe loan proceeds and take title to their properties, at John\n\nMoran's behest they designated MDG as a 20% beneficiary.            However,\n\nthere were no signatures of anyone purporting to represent MDG on\nthe documents setting up the two trusts.             Consequently, when a\n\nletter from an attorney for Puente and Boersner disclosed to First\n\nAmerican that MDG was one of three beneficiaries of the trust that\nwas taking title to the Commonwealth Avenue property, John Moran\n\nwas insulated because the bank did not have information linking him\n\nto MDG.     To further maintain his anonymity with respect to MDG,\n\nJohn Moran did not submit the customary post-closing settlement\n\nstatements or any records regarding the trustees or beneficiaries\n\nof the MDG Trust.       See, e.g., United States v. Cauble, 706 F.2d\n\n1322, 1355 (5th Cir. 1983) (considering defendant's \"disregard for\nthe bank's routine practices\" relevant to intent to defraud).\n\n            In sum, there was sufficient evidence to allow a rational\n\njury to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that John Moran\nconcealed his financial arrangements with Puente and Boersner not\n\nas the product of a good faith, honest oversight but rather\n\npursuant to an affirmative endeavor calculated to defraud First\n\nAmerican.        As the evidence supports the conclusion that John\n\nMoran's conduct rose to the level of a knowing \"scheme or artifice\"\n\nto defraud, the bank fraud convictions returned against him must be\n\nreinstated.\n\n            C.    Bank Fraud Charges Against Nora Moran (Counts Two\n                  and Three)\n\n            We    recognize   that   the    government's   bank   fraud   case\n\nagainst Nora Moran was not as strong as that against John Moran.\n\n                                     -23-\n\fIn this regard it is not clear that at the January 15, 1987 meeting\n\nof First American's Board of Directors, Nora Moran participated in\n\na dispositive vote on the loans.    Though the government advanced a\ntheory that a vote was taken to ratify the Puente/Boersner loans,\n\nit appears that the Board rubber-stamped as a mere formality a\n\nsummary report of loans the Executive Committee had approved in\nDecember.    Moreover, it is not clear that the Board of Directors at\n\nthat time had the power to reject the Executive Committee's loan\n\ndecisions.\n\n            Nevertheless,   the   district    court   erred   for   two\n\nindependent reasons when it granted Nora Moran a judgment of\n\nacquittal on counts two and three.       To begin with, without regard\n\nfor what transpired on January 15, 1987,14 a rational trier of fact\ncould have found that Nora Moran, who admitted to Ragalevsky and\n\nAdams that she was aware of her husband's outside dealings and\n\narrangements concerning the projects prior to the consummation of\nthe transactions at issue, chose not to disclose the conflicts to\n\nthe appropriate bank officials in her capacity as bank director\n\nbecause she anticipated that a financial windfall would accrue to\n\nher husband (and by extension to her) should the loans be approved\n\nand feared that a disclosure would undermine the approval process.\n\n     14\n      We note that the government's theory of Nora Moran's\nliability for bank fraud was not limited exclusively to her active\nparticipation in the January vote. For instance, the indictment\ncharged that in spite of her fiduciary position and independently\nof any Board votes or meetings she chose not to disclose her\nhusband's brokerage or profit arrangement and in fact executed the\nMDG Trust document in order to facilitate the fraudulent scheme.\nFurthermore, the government pursued its non-disclosure theory of\nliability at trial and during its closing argument.\n\n                                  -24-\n\f              Moreover,   there    was     significant      evidence    tending    to\n\nestablish     Nora    Moran's     knowing,       active    participation    in    the\n\nfraudulent scheme:        Nora Moran accompanied her husband, Puente,\nBoersner, Noke, and a construction inspector to visit the project\n\nsites in November 1986 before the loan applications were submitted\n\nas proposals or approved; a mere two days before the Executive\nCommittee approved the loans, she signed the papers establishing\n\nthe MDG Trust which functioned as a repository for the 20% interest\n\nin    the   profits    generated     by    the    Puente/Boersner       development\n\nprojects;     John    Moran's    secretary,       Elizabeth    Longo,   ordinarily\n\nserved as a trustee for his real estate transactions, suggesting\n\nthat such a break from routine likely would have sparked a modicum\n\nof inquiry from Nora Moran as to the purpose for the formation of\nMDG; John and Nora Moran shared financial matters, including filing\n\njoint tax returns and transferring funds between their separate\n\nbusiness ventures; and, Nora Moran was an astute real estate broker\nand    bank    director   familiar        with    the     affirmative    duties    of\n\ndisclosure      governing       fiduciaries       when    confronted    with      bank\n\ntransactions that affected them personally.15\n\n              Considered together, the foregoing facts justified a\n\nconclusion that Nora Moran knew of her husband's stake in the\n\n\n\n\n       15\n      For example, there was evidence to suggest that it was the\nbank's practice to provide every director with a copy of the Code\nof Professional Ethics. Furthermore, Nora Moran attended a July 9,\n1986 meeting of the Board of Directors at which Finnegan disclosed\nher insider stake in the proposed Nightingale loan and abstained\nfrom voting.\n\n                                          -25-\n\foutcome   of    the   loans16   and    understood   that   federal    banking\n\nregulations, First American's Code of Professional Ethics, and her\n\ncommon-law fiduciary status as a bank director required her to make\nthe appropriate disclosures.17           Nevertheless she chose not to\n\ndivulge the information to maintain the false impression that the\n\nloans were not tainted or suspect in any significant way.\n             We recognize, as emphasized by the district court, that\n\nNora Moran's conduct may not have directly induced First American\n\nto allocate the $17 million in loans to Puente and Boersner or\n\notherwise      have   influenced      anyone   involved    in   the   lending\n\ndecision-making process.18      However, a finding that her conduct had\n\nsuch an impact was not required for a conviction of bank fraud in\n\nthis case.     See, e.g., Kenrick, 221 F.3d at 29 (actual reliance by\n\nthe bank \"plainly ha[s] no place in the federal fraud statutes\")\n\n(quoting Neder v. United States, 527 U.S. 1, 25, 119 S.Ct. 1827,\n\n1841 (1999)).     Nor, as Nora Moran suggests is the case, could the\nevidence establish only that she breached nothing more than a\n\n     16\n      We emphasize further that the jurors, drawing upon common\nsense and their own life experiences, reasonably might have\ninferred that spouses such as the Morans in relationships whose\nprobity and openness have not been called into question (for\ninstance before the closings on the loans) are wont to share non-\nconfidential details of their professional lives.\n     17\n      We note that the district court in its opinion indicated that\nNora Moran at least by December 11, 1986, was aware of John Moran's\nbrokerage fee and 20% interest and, in failing to disclose this\ninformation, \"violated that part of Regulation O and the Bank's\nCode of Ethics requiring such disclosure.\" Opinion at 23.\n     18\n      See Opinion at 59-60 (\"the government failed to present\nevidence sufficient for a reasonable jury to find that Nora Moran\nknowingly participated in actions of the Bank that had the effect\nof causing or facilitating the making of the loans\").\n\n                                      -26-\n\ffiduciary duty owed to First American which conduct, standing\n\nalone, purportedly cannot constitute bank fraud as a matter of\n\nlaw.19    Rather, the evidence supported a conclusion that Nora Moran\nknowingly executed the scheme to defraud First American through her\n\ndeceptive acts (for example, signing the trust documents for the\n\nentity holding the 20% profit interest) and omissions (deliberately\nconcealing information that might have delayed or terminated the\n\nloan review process) and therefore was a sufficient basis on which\n\nthe jury could convict her for bank fraud.\n\n               Alternatively,   these    facts   make     out   the   essential\n\nelements of aiding and abetting liability for bank fraud.20               Thus,\n\neven if Nora Moran did not execute or attempt to execute the\n\nscheme,    there    was   sufficient    evidence    to    conclude    beyond   a\nreasonable doubt that she willfully aided and abetted John Moran's\n\nfraud by associating herself with his venture and seeking by her\n\nactions to make it succeed.           See 18 U.S.C. § 2; see also United\n\nStates    v.    Colon-Munoz,    192   F.3d   210,   223    (1st   Cir.   1999).\n\n     19\n      The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in United States\nv. Henderson, 19 F.3d 917, 923 & n.7 (5th Cir. 1994), confronted a\nsimilar claim that mere breach of fiduciary duty cannot constitute\na \"scheme or artifice\" to defraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1344 but, as we\ndo here, found sufficient evidence of more than such a breach, thus\nobviating the need to reach the issue. Nevertheless, while \"not\nevery breach of every fiduciary duty works a criminal fraud,\"\nUnited States v. George, 477 F.2d 508, 512 (7th Cir. 1973), we find\nno federal jurisprudence establishing as a matter of law that a\nfailure to disclose a conflict of interest or a breach of fiduciary\nduty cannot constitute or aid and abet a scheme to defraud,\nassuming the requisite materiality and specific intent to deceive\nfor personal gain are established.\n     20\n      We note that an alternative accomplice theory of liability\nwas charged in the indictment, advanced by the government at trial,\nand presented to the jury in the court's final instructions.\n\n                                      -27-\n\fFurthermore, the evidence was sufficient on which to premise Nora\n\nMoran's culpable state of mind for aiding and abetting liability to\n\nthe extent that she consciously shared her husband's knowledge of\nthe underlying criminal scheme and intended to participate in it\n\nfor the purpose of bringing about financial gain.\n\n             D.   Conspiracy Charges Against John and Nora Moran\n                  (Count One)\n\n             Finally, we find that the government offered sufficient\n\nevidence to convict both Morans of the conspiracy to commit bank\n\nfraud under 18 U.S.C. § 371.          As we elaborated previously, the\n\nevidence     supported    a   conclusion    that   the   Morans   agreed   to\n\nparticipate in a scheme to defraud First American for the common\ngoal    of   personal    pecuniary   gain,21   knowingly   and    voluntarily\n\nparticipated in the conspiracy, and took at least one affirmative\n\novert act in furtherance of the conspiracy.          See Blasini-Lluberas,\n\n169 F.3d at 67.      Accordingly, the jury verdict on the conspiracy\n\ncount must be reinstated.22\n\n\n       21\n      Of course, the agreement need not be made expressly nor\nproved by direct evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Woodward,\n149 F.3d 46, 67, 68 (1st Cir. 1998).\n       22\n      The district court disposed of the bank fraud conspiracy\nconvictions on the ground that the evidence could not support a\nconviction against either Moran on the underlying bank fraud\nsubstantive offenses. See Opinion at 60 (\"the failure to establish\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that either defendant committed the\nsubstantive offense was also a failure to establish beyond a\nreasonable doubt the agreement between them to commit the offense\")\n(emphasis in original).    It did not consider, however, that a\ndefendant can be guilty of the inchoate offense of conspiracy even\nif he and his co-conspirator are not guilty of the underlying\nsubstantive offense so long as he knowingly entered an agreement to\ncommit the substantive offense and participated in the plot to\neffectuate the offense; success is not a required element. See,\n\n                                     -28-\n\f                           III.   CONCLUSION\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgments of\n\nacquittal, reinstate the convictions on counts one, two, and three,\nand remand the case to the district court for further proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n          Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\n                     (Concurring Opinion follows.)\n          BOUDIN, Chief Judge (concurring).       John Moran and Nora\nMoran were charged with bank fraud under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1344, 371\n(2000).   The jury found both defendants guilty, but the district\n\ncourt granted a motion for acquittal as to both defendants.            The\ngovernment has appealed.    My concern is with the evidence against\nNora Moran.\n\n          The government's primary theory in the trial was that\nNora Moran, as a director of the bank, had voted to approve certain\nloans without disclosing her husband's interest in them.         In the\nalternative,   the   government   argued   that   Nora   Moran   had   an\n\nindependent duty to disclose her husband's participation on both\n\n\ne.g., Salinas v. United States, 522 U.S. 52, 65, 118 S.Ct. 469, 477\n(1997) (\"It is elementary that a conspiracy may exist and be\npunished whether or not the substantive crime ensues, for the\nconspiracy is a distinct evil, dangerous to the public, and so\npunishable itself.\"); United States v. Belardo-Quinones, 71 F.3d\n941, 944 (1st Cir. 1995) (conspiracy may exist even if the object\nof the conspiracy cannot be achieved).\n\n                                  -29-\n\fsides of the bank loan and that, because she fostered John's fraud\n\n(as described below), she was guilty of aiding and abetting.                   The\n\ndistrict court's opinion directing an acquittal discussed the\nvoting theory which it found unsupported by the evidence, but it\n\nnot discuss the government's alternative theories.\n\n          On    appeal,   the     panel's      reinstatement     of   the   jury's\nverdict does not rely on the government's primary theory, namely,\n\nthat Nora voted on the loan.             As the panel opinion points out,\n\nthere is no clear proof that Nora knowingly voted on the loan\n\nbenefitting     her   husband.      The     only    evidence     is   that    Nora\n\nparticipated in a board of directors' vote that rubber-stamped the\n\napproval of a summary report of the loans made in the previous\n\nmonth.   A summary report contained only headline numbers and did\nnot specify the underlying loans and their details.\n\n          To sustain the jury's verdict as against the district\n\ncourt's judgments of acquittal, one must rely on the government's\nalternative    arguments.        Under   one    theory,   Nora    failed     (as   a\n\nfiduciary) to reveal her husband's double dealing and therefore\n\ncommitted fraud by that non-disclosure; under the (sounder) aiding\n\nand abetting version of the theory, she also took positive steps--\n\nsuch as signing the papers to establish the business trust that was\n\nused to conceal the Morans' interest in the loans--to further\n\nJohn's fraud.    In either case, it was necessary for the bank fraud\n\nconviction to prove that Nora acted with intent to defraud. United\n\nStates v. Kenrick, 221 F.3d 19, 30 (1st Cir.) (en banc), cert.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -30-\n\fdenied, 531 U.S. 961 (2000), and cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1042\n\n(2000).\n\n          This culpable state of mind with respect to Nora depends\non   proving   four   facts:    first,   that    Nora     knew     of    John's\n\nparticipation on both sides of the transaction; second, that she\n\nknew that John had not disclosed his conflict of interest to the\nbank; third, that she knew that she had an obligation to disclose\n\nJohn's position if John did not make the requisite disclosure; and\n\nfourth, that she acted dishonestly rather than negligently in\n\nfailing to disclose.    The second condition is doubtful and, if the\n\nsecond fails, the fourth (which depends on the other three) also is\n\ninfirm.\n\n          Nora   certainly     knew   that   John   was   acting        for   the\nborrowers; there is clear evidence on this point.                What is less\n\nclear is whether she knew that John was acting for the bank as\n\nwell; but this can probably be inferred from her statement that she\nhad understood that John had disclosed his interest to the bank.\n\nIf John was not also acting for the bank, he would hardly have\n\nneeded to mention to his wife his alleged disclosure to the bank\n\nsince there would have been nothing to disclose.\n\n          On the second condition--that Nora knew of John's failure\n\nto disclose--the government's evidence is extremely thin.               Clearly\n\nsuch a factual predicate is essential:       it would be quite a stretch\n\nto hold Nora criminally liable for failing to make an independent\n\ndisclosure to the bank, even though she believed that John had\n\ndisclosed his interest in the project.          The only evidence as to\n\n\n                                  -31-\n\fwhether John told her he had disclosed his interest to the bank is\n\nNora's claim that he said he had.         The statement was made by Nora\n\nprior   to    trial   and   recorded   by   a   third   party.   Although\ninadmissible hearsay if offered by Nora, the recordation was\n\noffered into evidence by the government for its own purposes.\n\n             Of course, the jury may have disbelieved her statement,\nmade after the fact to bank attorneys investigating the Morans'\n\ninvolvement with the loans, as a post hoc attempt at exculpation.\n\nIt is not clear what basis the jury would have had for such a\n\nrejection.    John certainly could have made such a statement to his\n\nwife, truthfully or not; and Nora did not testify at trial so her\n\ndemeanor was not subject to assessment.            Still, the jury could\n\nsimply not have believed Nora's statement.\n             We can never know whether the jury found fraudulent\n\nintent based on this theory. At trial, the government concentrated\n\nprimarily on the hopeless theory that Nora had voted on the loan\neven though it presented its alternative theories as well.         Yet in\n\nthis court Nora does not argue that evidence of fraudulent intent\n\nwas entirely lacking but argues that her failure to disclose was\n\nnot material, an unpersuasive position given the reach of the\n\nmateriality concept.        It is not easy to support the district\n\ncourt's result on the basis of doubts not relied on by the district\n\ncourt in granting the motion, nor urged by the defendant herself on\n\nthis appeal.\n\n             Because Nora moved for a new trial in the district court-\n\n-a motion initially mooted by the directed judgment of acquittal--\n\n\n                                   -32-\n\fthat motion remains to be considered by the district court on\n\nremand. The district court, already disposed to grant an acquittal\n\noutright, may well be inclined to grant a new trial on weight-of-\nthe-evidence grounds.       United States v. Montilla-Rivera, 115 F.3d\n\n1060, 1067 (1st Cir. 1997). Given the collapse of the government's\n\nprimary   voting   theory    and    the   thin    factual   support      for    the\nfraudulent non-disclosure claim against Nora, a new trial for Nora\n\nmight be amply justified, assuming that the government's asserted\n\nobjection   to   the   timeliness    of     the   new   trial   motion    can    be\n\novercome.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -33-\n\f",

Greenberg, of the Third Circuit, sitting\nby designation.\n\f            Greenburg, Senior Circuit Judge.       This case comes on\n\nbefore this court on appeal from a July 13, 2000 memorandum and\n\norder of the district court entering a judgment of acquittal for\n\ndefendants-appellees John Moran and Nora Moran after their jury\n\nconvictions for bank fraud and conspiracy to commit bank fraud\n\nunder 18 U.S.C. §§ 1344 and 371.    Granting appellees' Fed. R. Crim.\n\nP. 29 motions one year after the jury returned the verdicts, the\n\ncourt concluded that the evidence the government submitted in its\n\ncase-in-chief was insufficient to sustain the convictions.          The\n\ngovernment challenges that determination on appeal, arguing that\nthe district court erred in failing to consider the full trial\n\nrecord before granting the motions.     The government contends that\nthe evidence, viewed in its totality and with all reasonable\ninferences drawn in the government's favor as the verdict winner,\n\nsupported a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that the Morans each\nknowingly engaged and conspired to engage in a scheme to defraud a\nfederally   insured   banking   institution   by   actively   concealing\n\nmaterial information concerning their outside interests in Boston\nreal-estate development projects secured by two loans made by the\ninstitution.    For the reasons set forth below, we agree with the\n\ngovernment and will reverse the judgment of the district court,\nreinstate the guilty verdicts, and remand the case to the district\ncourt for further proceedings.\n\n\n\n                           I.    BACKGROUND\n\n            A brief summary of the salient facts follows, though we\n\n                                  -2-\n\freserve making a more detailed exposition until we set forth our\n\nlegal analysis.      This appeal grows out of a superseding indictment\n\ncharging the Morans with bank fraud and conspiracy in connection\nwith   two   loans   the   First   American     Bank   for   Savings      (First\n\nAmerican), a federally insured institution, made in December 1986\n\nto real-estate developers Edgar Puente and David Boersner.                Puente\nand Boersner needed financing for two renovation projects seeking\n\nto transform brownstone and apartment buildings on Commonwealth\n\nAvenue and in West Rutland Square in Boston into condominiums.\n\n             John Moran, who for many years on numerous occasions had\n\nrepresented First American as a conveyancing attorney, met with\n\nPuente and Boersner in October 1986 to discuss serving as their\n\nmortgage broker.       Puente and Boersner hired John Moran in that\ncapacity under the self-styled \"Moran Holdings,\" agreeing to pay\n\nhim a fee equal to 1.5% of any loans he successfully procured for\n\ntheir projects.      John Moran subsequently arranged and attended a\nmeeting   with   Puente,   Boersner,      and   a   loan   officer   at    First\n\nAmerican, Edmund Noke, which culminated in the parties' agreeing\n\nthat First American would extend two loans totaling $17 million to\n\nPuente and Boersner in exchange for a 40% profit interest in the\n\ndevelopment projects.      The parties further agreed that John Moran\n\nwould act as the closing attorney for the bank on the loans.                In a\n\nseparate agreement, not involving Noke, Puente and Boersner agreed\n\nto give John Moran a 20% profit interest in the projects to be held\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fby the Moran Development Group (MDG) Trust, established by Nora\n\nMoran, its sole trustee, on December 15, 1986.1\n\n          Nora Moran, who at all times relevant to this appeal was\na real-estate broker and the wife of John Moran, was on the Board\n\nof Directors of First American, having assumed the office on August\n\n21, 1986.2   First American had adopted a Code of Professional\nEthics in 1979 requiring, inter alia, that an officer or director\n\ndisclose any direct or indirect financial interest in a bank loan\n\nand disqualify him or herself from participating in the approval\n\nprocess for any such loan.   This requirement was consistent with\n\nRegulation \"O\" of the Federal Reserve Board, 12 C.F.R. § 215,\n\nwhich, pursuant to 12 U.S.C. § 375a(10), requires interested\n\ndirectors to disclose fully any personal financial stake   or that\nof their related entities in a given loan and prohibits them from\n\nparticipating directly or indirectly in any vote to extend such\n\ncredit.   The regulation also requires banks to keep records of\ninsider loans to directors, officers, and their related interests\n\nand to report annually all insider loans to federal regulators.\n\nSee 12 C.F.R. §§ 215.7 and 215.9.\n\n          In November 1986, the Morans, Noke, Puente, Boersner, and\n\na representative of Contractors Funding Corporation, a company\n\n\n     1\n      John Moran's interest was 20% of the share retained by Puente\nand Boersner, or 12% of the total profit interest.\n     2\n      Nora Moran was a trustee of the bank from March 1985 until\nJuly 1986, when it changed its organizational structure to provide,\ninter alia, that it would have a Board of Directors rather than a\nBoard of Trustees.      We use the terms trustee and director\ninterchangeably.\n\n                               -4-\n\fspecializing   in    construction      inspection       services,    visited   the\n\nCommonwealth Avenue and West Rutland Square project sites.                     John\n\nMoran subsequently submitted formal, written proposals on behalf of\nPuente and Boersner seeking non-recourse loans for the projects\n\n(which, as opposed to recourse loans, insulate borrowers from\n\npersonal liability for the amount of the loans).                    The proposals\ncarried the name Moran Holdings and were signed by John Moran, but\n\ndid not mention his brokerage or profit arrangement with Puente and\n\nBoersner.\n\n            Noke sent memoranda summarizing the loan proposals to\n\nFirst American's Executive Committee in December 1986, as all loans\n\nfor amounts greater than $500,000 required its approval.                    These\n\nmemoranda   did     not   mention    John     Moran's    brokerage     or   profit\narrangement with Puente and Boersner.               The Executive Committee\n\napproved the loans on a recourse basis on December 17, and they\n\nclosed on December 23 and 24.3         John Moran represented the bank at\nthe closings, charging $35,500 for his services although he in fact\n\ncollected only $30,500 on the fee.             He also received $255,000 in\n\nmortgage    brokerage     fees      from     the   proceeds   of     the    loans.\n\nFurthermore, John Moran kept an additional $52,000 in bank funds in\n\nhis checking account, which should have been disbursed at the\n\nclosings.\n\n     3\n      Though it is not essential to our analysis that we do so, we\nnote that the district court cited the discrepant closing date of\nDecember 26 for the Commonwealth Avenue project loan, by way of\nreference to documentation submitted by John Moran to the bank in\nJanuary 1988.   The parties agree and all the other evidence on\nrecord indicates, however, that the loan closed on December 24,\n1986.\n\n                                       -5-\n\f            On January 15, 1987, the Board of Directors, with Nora\n\nMoran in attendance, met to consider an agenda which included a\n\nreport of the Executive Committee's activities for December 1986.\nMinutes from a December 17 meeting of the Executive Committee show\n\nthat two    votes    were    taken,    one       approving      140   loans     totaling\n\n$31,098,750 and another approving 13 additional loans totaling\n$58,961,000 with the Puente/Boersner loans included in the latter\n\ngroup.   The Executive Committee's report to the Board, however,\n\nincluded details      concerning       only      the    vote    on    the    140     loans.\n\nNevertheless, the government argued at trial and argues on this\n\nappeal that the Board voted to approve the Puente/Boersner loans at\n\nthe   January   15    meeting        and    that       Nora    Moran,       rather     than\n\ndisqualifying herself because of her financial interest, voted in\nfavor of the loans.           Notwithstanding their dispute over what\n\nhappened at the Board meeting on January 15, 1987, the parties\n\nagree that Nora Moran never disclosed to any employee, officer, or\nagent of First American her husband's status as the mortgage broker\n\nfor Puente and Boersner or his profit interest in their development\n\nprojects.\n\n            Following       the    closings,       John       Moran    did    not      file\n\nsettlement statements with the bank, forms customarily signed by\n\nall the parties and submitted within 30 days accounting for the use\n\nof the loan proceeds.             Moreover, he did not submit any records\n\ndocumenting his mortgage brokerage arrangement, his 20% interest in\n\nthe project, or his retention of the additional $52,000 in bank\n\nfunds.   Furthermore, he did not disclose that he used a portion of\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fthat money in April 1987 to pay off a loan that Puente and Boersner\n\nhad secured from Olympic International Bank & Trust Company (where\n\nJohn Moran served as a director) as a down payment towards the\npurchase of the West Rutland Square property.\n\n              In    1988,    First    American       vice   president   and   general\n\ncounsel Michael Hanson reviewed the files on the Puente/Boersner\nprojects because the loans were not performing4 satisfactorily and\n\ndiscovered that the settlement statements were missing.                       After he\n\neventually obtained copies of the statements, Hanson realized that\n\nsignatures were absent from them and that balances were unaccounted\n\nfor.        He learned also that John Moran had received mortgage\n\nbrokerage fees from the loan proceeds.                   Finally, Hanson discovered\n\nthat       John    Moran    had   obtained      a    20%    profit   stake    in    the\nPuente/Boersner projects which he expected to satisfy by securing\n\na   penthouse        apartment       in   one       of   the   buildings.          These\n\nunderstandably disturbing revelations caused Hanson to contact the\nbank's outside attorneys, the firm of Warner & Stackpole, regarding\n\nthe Puente/Boersner loans.\n\n              On May 3, 1988, Warner & Stackpole attorneys Stanley\n\nRagalevsky and Samuel Adams met with John Moran and Nora Moran for\n\napproximately two hours. According to the memorandum regarding the\n\nmeeting that Ragalevsky and Adams submitted to First American after\n\nthe Morans approved it, Nora Moran admitted that she had been aware\n\nof her husband's brokerage and profit arrangement by the time the\n\n\n       4\n      In banking jargon, when required payments are not made on a\nloan it is said to be \"performing\" unsatisfactorily.\n\n                                          -7-\n\floans were approved.   She also admitted that she never volunteered\n\nthis information to anyone at the bank, believing that her husband\n\nhad made the appropriate disclosures.      John Moran claimed that he\nhad made full disclosure of his interest in the ventures to Noke\n\nand had given up his interest in the properties.      As a consequence\n\nof the disclosures in the memorandum and the facts revealed by the\nrelated investigation, Nora Moran was asked to resign her director\n\nposition from the First American Bancorp, Inc., the bank's holding\n\ncompany to which she had moved from the bank proper.        The Board of\n\nDirectors of Bancorp accepted her resignation on June 30, 1988. By\n\nOctober 1990, First American failed and was closed by the FDIC.\n\n          On July 9, 1997, a grand jury returned a superseding\n\nindictment against John and Nora Moran for bank fraud under 18\nU.S.C. § 1344, aiding and abetting bank fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 2,\n\nand conspiracy to commit bank fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 371.5\n\nSpecifically, counts two and three of the indictment charged that\nJohn Moran as a closing attorney for First American and Nora Moran\n\nas a director of First American committed fraud when, though duty-\n\nbound to do so, they failed to disclose their material profit\n\ninterest in the projects when the $17 million mortgage loans were\n\nissued.   With   respect   to   the   conspiracy,   count   one   of   the\n\nindictment alleged a number of overt acts, including the formation\n\n     5\n      The Morans do not claim that the ten-year statute of\nlimitations for bank fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1344 had run by the\ntime of the indictment. See 18 U.S.C. § 3293. In this regard we\npoint out that the indictment charges only acts the prosecution of\nwhich had not been barred by the previously applicable five-year\nstatute of limitations as of August 1989. See Pub.L. No. 101-73 §\n961(l)(3)).\n\n                                 -8-\n\fof    the   MDG    Trust.     The     two    substantive      bank    fraud     counts\n\ncorresponded to the two bank loans, and the conspiracy count\n\ncovered conduct from October 1986 to June 1988.                      The indictment\nalso contained an unrelated fourth count of bank fraud against Nora\n\nMoran in connection with her alleged involvement with a loan made\n\nby First American to finance the purchase of a property located on\nMarlborough Street in Boston.\n\n             The trial commenced on May 17, 1999.                In its case-in-\n\nchief, which lasted 24 days, the government presented evidence\n\npurporting        to   demonstrate    that    John    Moran    fraudulently        had\nexploited his position as the bank's closing attorney with respect\n\nto    the   Puente/Boersner        projects    by    failing    to    disclose     his\n\nfinancial interest in them.            In particular, the evidence showed\nthat First American's records, including Noke's memoranda to the\n\nExecutive Committee, did not reflect any disclosure by John Moran\n\nof his brokerage arrangement with Puente and Boersner or his profit\ninterest in the properties.            For example, the closing settlement\n\nstatements, which notably John Moran did not sign, indicated only\n\nthat he received legal fees.           Further, the record did not contain\n\nany   documentary       evidence     disclosing      his   status    as   MDG    Trust\n\nbeneficiary.\n\n             Significantly, Noke testified in the government's case\n\nthat John Moran did not inform him of his economic interest in the\nPuente/Boersner projects before the loans were submitted to the\nExecutive Committee for approval. Noke claimed that if he duly had\n\nbeen notified he would have prepared an insider transaction report\n\n                                        -9-\n\ffor the bank; no such report was introduced at trial.        Ragalevsky\n\nand Adams testified that regardless of his possible disclosure to\n\nNoke, John Moran was required to notify upper level management in\nwriting of his financial stake in the projects to satisfy his\n\nprofessional   duty   as   the   bank's   attorney;   no   such   written\n\ndisclosure was introduced at trial.       The government also elicited\ntestimony from a number of other witnesses on the nature of the\n\nprofessional duties John Moran owed to First American, as well as\n\nJohn Moran's own testimony from another trial acknowledging the\n\nethical and legal duties of a fiduciary.\n\n          Government witnesses described with respect to Nora Moran\n\nthe duties a director owes to a bank, such as that of full and fair\n\ndisclosure of any facts material to the bank's interests.             The\ngovernment also introduced evidence demonstrating her involvement\n\nin the Puente/Boersner loans (visiting the project sites and\n\nexecuting the MDG Trust document) and her failure to inform any\nbank official of her husband's outside interests regarding the\n\nproperties.    Further, the government attempted to show that Nora\nMoran voted to approve the loans at the January 15, 1987 Board of\n\nDirectors meeting on the theory that it was routine practice for\n\nloans approved by the Executive Committee to be submitted to the\nBoard of Directors for ratification or modification.\n\n          At the close of the government's case, the Morans made\nmotions for judgments of acquittal under Fed. R. Crim. P. 29.         The\n\n\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fcourt granted Nora Moran's motion with respect to count four,6 but\ndenied the motions as to the remaining counts.               In the defense\n\ncase,      John   Moran   testified   to   having   made   full   and   timely\ndisclosure of his outside pecuniary interest in the bank loans to\n\nNoke.      John Moran also testified that in November 1986, he had\n\nengaged in a similar transaction in which he functioned as the\nclosing attorney for First American and nevertheless received a\n\n$100,000 finder's fee from the borrower.            He claimed that he had\n\ndisclosed this earlier conflict of interest to William Collins, the\n\nbank's loan officer on the November 1986 loan.\n\n              On cross-examination, John Moran indicated that he had\n\nsent a check for $18,750 to his wife via her real estate company on\n\nJanuary 15, 1987, the very day of the Board of Directors meeting at\nissue in this case.       John Moran did not indicate on the check what\n\nthe payment represented, though it was his common practice to do\n\nso. The government sought to demonstrate that the Morans routinely\ncommingled their business finances during the relevant time period.\n\nNora Moran presented only one witness in her defense, an economics\nexpert who discussed the general banking and real estate climate\n\nduring the relevant time period.             The government called William\n\nCollins as its rebuttal witness.             He testified that he had no\nrecollection of the November 1986 loan about which John Moran\ntestified or of any disclosure John Moran made as to his finder's\nfee.\n\n\n       6\n      The judgment of acquittal on count four is not before us on\nappeal.\n\n                                      -11-\n\f            At the close of all the evidence, the Morans again moved\n\nfor judgments of acquittal.          The court reserved its ruling and\n\ncharged the jury which, on July 14, 1999, returned guilty verdicts\non the three remaining counts against the Morans.               Thereafter, the\n\nMorans filed post-trial motions under Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(c)\n\nseeking judgments of acquittal.               The district court received\nmemoranda and draft transcripts from all parties and on July 13,\n\n2000, on the basis of the submissions issued the decision and order\n\nfrom which the government appeals, entering a judgment of acquittal\n\non all counts for want of evidentiary support.             The court made its\n\nruling considering only the evidence introduced on the government's\n\ndirect case rather than on the full trial record, citing to Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 29(b), which mandates that a court revisiting a reserved\nmotion    for    judgment   of   acquittal    may    consider     only   evidence\n\nintroduced as of the time that the court reserved ruling on the\n\nmotion.\n\n            The court concluded that Noke's testimony and the absence\n\nof bank records documenting John Moran's timely disclosure of his\nbrokerage and profit arrangement could not sustain John Moran's\n\nconvictions on the substantive bank fraud counts as the defense\n\nsuccessfully had demonstrated defects in Noke's memory and work\nperformance and in First American's record-keeping practices.                 The\ncourt further concluded that the government failed to show that\nNora Moran participated in any vote on or otherwise facilitated the\n\napproval    of    the   Puente/Boersner      loans   and   that    the   evidence\ntherefore was insufficient to sustain the verdicts convicting her\n\n                                     -12-\n\fof substantive bank fraud.             The court did not consider an aiding\n\nand abetting theory of liability.                 Finally, the court concluded\n\nthat the government's failure to prove the underlying substantive\noffenses was fatal to the conspiracy convictions of both Morans.\n\nThe government timely filed a notice of appeal on August 10, 2000.\n\nWe have jurisdiction over an appeal from a final judgment of the\ndistrict court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291 and 18 U.S.C. § 3731,7\n\nand   the   district     court   exercised        subject    matter     jurisdiction\n\npursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3231.\n\n                                 II.

At the close of trial, the Morans\n\nagain made Rule 29 motions on which the court did reserve its\nruling, allowing it to act substantively on the motions after the\n\njury returned its verdict.       At that point the court could not act\n\non   the   original    motions   for    acquittal   adjudicated    after   the\n\ngovernment's case-in-chief and thus was required to consider the\n\nfull   record   when    acting   on    the    Morans'   second   motions   for\n\nacquittal.\n\n            We are satisfied that simply by labeling its post-trial\nRule 29 ruling as a reconsideration and reversal of its earlier\n\n\n\n       of acquittal shall be used in their place. The court on\n       motion of a defendant or of its own motion shall order\n       the entry of judgment of acquittal of one or more\n       offenses charged in the indictment or information after\n       the evidence on either side is closed if the evidence is\n       insufficient to sustain a conviction of such offense or\n       offenses. If a defendant's motion for judgment of\n       acquittal at the close of the evidence offered by the\n       government is not granted, the defendant may offer\n       evidence without having reserved the right.\n\n       (b) RESERVATION OF DECISION ON MOTION. The court may\n       reserve decision on a motion for judgment of acquittal,\n       proceed with the trial (where the motion is made before\n       the close of all the evidence), submit the case to the\n       jury and decide the motion either before the jury returns\n       a verdict or after it returns a verdict of guilty or is\n       discharged without having returned a verdict. If the\n       court reserves decision, it must decide the motion on the\n       basis of the evidence at the time the ruling was\n       reserved.\n\n                                       -15-\n\fRule 29 ruling, the court could not relate back the time when it\n\nreserved its ruling on the motions made at the end of all the\n\nevidence to the point at which it denied the first motions for\nacquittal.        After all, if it could do so it effectively would\n\ncircumvent the explicit requirement in Rule 29(b) that if a court\n\n\"reserves decision, it must decide the motion on the basis of the\nevidence at the time the ruling was reserved.\"                   Moreover, if the\n\ncourt     could   deny     a    motion   for   acquittal    at   the       end   of   the\n\ngovernment's case-in-chief and then grant it on reconsideration, as\n\na practical matter there would be no distinction between denying a\n\nmotion for acquittal or reserving a ruling on it for either way the\n\ncourt subsequently could grant the motion on a static record.\n\n             B.

His lack of recollection is notable for two\n\nreasons: (1) circumstances where the bank's closing attorney also\n\nfunctioned as a mortgage broker for and co-partner with the bank's\n\nclients in the same transaction were rare, and the jury reasonably\n\ncould have balanced this unusual circumstance against the fact that\nnothing about the Puente/Boersner loans stood out in Noke's mind;\n\n(2) insider arrangements of this nature typically triggered greater\n\nscrutiny and generated special paperwork. Accordingly, the absence\nof bank records documenting John Moran's outside arrangements was\n\nanother factor that the jury could take into account in concluding\n\nthat he had concealed the details of his relationship with Puente\nand Boersner.11   Moreover, in contrast the government introduced\n\n\ninstitution is a factor to be considered in evaluating the\nprosecution's case, for instance with respect to the defendant's\nstate of mind (a bank director or a bank attorney would be harder\npressed to claim good faith than an unseasoned layperson),\nultimately proof of a knowing \"scheme or artifice to defraud\" --\nwhether executed by affirmative acts or omissions -- is all that\nthe statute requires for conviction.\n     11\n      It is also significant that, although he testified, John\nMoran did not introduce at trial any records documenting his\nalleged disclosure.    Notwithstanding the passage of time, the\nrelocation of offices, or the intervention of allegedly calamitous\nnatural events, one might reasonably expect that John Moran would\nhave been careful to retain copies of any documents disclosing to\nbank officials his outside dealings with Puente and Boersner\nconsidering the intense scrutiny to which the loans were subjected\n\n                               -19-\n\finsider    loan       records   from    June   1986   showing    that   Elizabeth\n\nFinnegan, a trustee of First American, disclosed her financial\n\ninterest   as     a    principal   in    American     Healthways,   Inc.    d/b/a\nNightingale before a vote was taken to consider increasing the\n\ncompany's line of credit.\n\n            The       Morans,   particularly     John   Moran,    mounted   three\n\nprincipal lines of attack against the government's non-disclosure\n\ntheory: (1) many of the bank's records from the relevant time\n\nperiod were in disarray or missing; (2) Noke's testimony was\n\nundermined to the extent that he could not recall significant\ndetails about the transactions or participants in question and by\n\nthe fact that nearly 10 years had passed from the time that the\n\nloans were closed; (3) John Moran testified that he had made the\nappropriate disclosures.

To begin with, without regard\n\nfor what transpired on January 15, 1987,14 a rational trier of fact\ncould have found that Nora Moran, who admitted to Ragalevsky and\n\nAdams that she was aware of her husband's outside dealings and\n\narrangements concerning the projects prior to the consummation of\nthe transactions at issue, chose not to disclose the conflicts to\n\nthe appropriate bank officials in her capacity as bank director\n\nbecause she anticipated that a financial windfall would accrue to\n\nher husband (and by extension to her) should the loans be approved\n\nand feared that a disclosure would undermine the approval process.\n\n     14\n      We note that the government's theory of Nora Moran's\nliability for bank fraud was not limited exclusively to her active\nparticipation in the January vote. For instance, the indictment\ncharged that in spite of her fiduciary position and independently\nof any Board votes or meetings she chose not to disclose her\nhusband's brokerage or profit arrangement and in fact executed the\nMDG Trust document in order to facilitate the fraudulent scheme.\nFurthermore, the government pursued its non-disclosure theory of\nliability at trial and during its closing argument.\n\n                                  -24-\n\f              Moreover,   there    was     significant      evidence    tending    to\n\nestablish     Nora    Moran's     knowing,       active    participation    in    the\n\nfraudulent scheme:        Nora Moran accompanied her husband, Puente,\nBoersner, Noke, and a construction inspector to visit the project\n\nsites in November 1986 before the loan applications were submitted\n\nas proposals or approved; a mere two days before the Executive\nCommittee approved the loans, she signed the papers establishing\n\nthe MDG Trust which functioned as a repository for the 20% interest\n\nin    the   profits    generated     by    the    Puente/Boersner       development\n\nprojects;     John    Moran's    secretary,       Elizabeth    Longo,   ordinarily\n\nserved as a trustee for his real estate transactions, suggesting\n\nthat such a break from routine likely would have sparked a modicum\n\nof inquiry from Nora Moran as to the purpose for the formation of\nMDG; John and Nora Moran shared financial matters, including filing\n\njoint tax returns and transferring funds between their separate\n\nbusiness ventures; and, Nora Moran was an astute real estate broker\nand    bank    director   familiar        with    the     affirmative    duties    of\n\ndisclosure      governing       fiduciaries       when    confronted    with      bank\n\ntransactions that affected them personally.15\n\n              Considered together, the foregoing facts justified a\n\nconclusion that Nora Moran knew of her husband's stake in the\n\n\n\n\n       15\n      For example, there was evidence to suggest that it was the\nbank's practice to provide every director with a copy of the Code\nof Professional Ethics. Furthermore, Nora Moran attended a July 9,\n1986 meeting of the Board of Directors at which Finnegan disclosed\nher insider stake in the proposed Nightingale loan and abstained\nfrom voting.\n\n                                          -25-\n\foutcome   of    the   loans16   and    understood   that   federal    banking\n\nregulations, First American's Code of Professional Ethics, and her\n\ncommon-law fiduciary status as a bank director required her to make\nthe appropriate disclosures.17           Nevertheless she chose not to\n\ndivulge the information to maintain the false impression that the\n\nloans were not tainted or suspect in any significant way.\n             We recognize, as emphasized by the district court, that\n\nNora Moran's conduct may not have directly induced First American\n\nto allocate the $17 million in loans to Puente and Boersner or\n\notherwise      have   influenced      anyone   involved    in   the   lending\n\ndecision-making process.18      However, a finding that her conduct had\n\nsuch an impact was not required for a conviction of bank fraud in\n\nthis case.

John Moran and Nora\nMoran were charged with bank fraud under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1344, 371\n(2000).   The jury found both defendants guilty, but the district\n\ncourt granted a motion for acquittal as to both defendants.            The\ngovernment has appealed.    My concern is with the evidence against\nNora Moran.\n\n          The government's primary theory in the trial was that\nNora Moran, as a director of the bank, had voted to approve certain\nloans without disclosing her husband's interest in them.         In the\nalternative,   the   government   argued   that   Nora   Moran   had   an\n\nindependent duty to disclose her husband's participation on both\n\n\ne.g., Salinas v.

The\n\ndistrict court's opinion directing an acquittal discussed the\nvoting theory which it found unsupported by the evidence, but it\n\nnot discuss the government's alternative theories.\n\n          On    appeal,   the     panel's      reinstatement     of   the   jury's\nverdict does not rely on the government's primary theory, namely,\n\nthat Nora voted on the loan.             As the panel opinion points out,\n\nthere is no clear proof that Nora knowingly voted on the loan\n\nbenefitting     her   husband.      The     only    evidence     is   that    Nora\n\nparticipated in a board of directors' vote that rubber-stamped the\n\napproval of a summary report of the loans made in the previous\n\nmonth.   A summary report contained only headline numbers and did\nnot specify the underlying loans and their details.\n\n          To sustain the jury's verdict as against the district\n\ncourt's judgments of acquittal, one must rely on the government's\nalternative    arguments.        Under   one    theory,   Nora    failed     (as   a\n\nfiduciary) to reveal her husband's double dealing and therefore\n\ncommitted fraud by that non-disclosure; under the (sounder) aiding\n\nand abetting version of the theory, she also took positive steps--\n\nsuch as signing the papers to establish the business trust that was\n\nused to conceal the Morans' interest in the loans--to further\n\nJohn's fraud.    In either case, it was necessary for the bank fraud\n\nconviction to prove that Nora acted with intent to defraud. United\n\nStates v.

The second condition is doubtful and, if the\n\nsecond fails, the fourth (which depends on the other three) also is\n\ninfirm.\n\n          Nora   certainly     knew   that   John   was   acting        for   the\nborrowers; there is clear evidence on this point.                What is less\n\nclear is whether she knew that John was acting for the bank as\n\nwell; but this can probably be inferred from her statement that she\nhad understood that John had disclosed his interest to the bank.\n\nIf John was not also acting for the bank, he would hardly have\n\nneeded to mention to his wife his alleged disclosure to the bank\n\nsince there would have been nothing to disclose.\n\n          On the second condition--that Nora knew of John's failure\n\nto disclose--the government's evidence is extremely thin.               Clearly\n\nsuch a factual predicate is essential:       it would be quite a stretch\n\nto hold Nora criminally liable for failing to make an independent\n\ndisclosure to the bank, even though she believed that John had\n\ndisclosed his interest in the project.          The only evidence as to\n\n\n                                  -31-\n\fwhether John told her he had disclosed his interest to the bank is\n\nNora's claim that he said he had.         The statement was made by Nora\n\nprior   to    trial   and   recorded   by   a   third   party.   Although\ninadmissible hearsay if offered by Nora, the recordation was\n\noffered into evidence by the government for its own purposes.\n\n             Of course, the jury may have disbelieved her statement,\nmade after the fact to bank attorneys investigating the Morans'\n\ninvolvement with the loans, as a post hoc attempt at exculpation.\n\nIt is not clear what basis the jury would have had for such a\n\nrejection.    John certainly could have made such a statement to his\n\nwife, truthfully or not; and Nora did not testify at trial so her\n\ndemeanor was not subject to assessment.            Still, the jury could\n\nsimply not have believed Nora's statement.\n             We can never know whether the jury found fraudulent\n\nintent based on this theory. At trial, the government concentrated\n\nprimarily on the hopeless theory that Nora had voted on the loan\neven though it presented its alternative theories as well.         Yet in\n\nthis court Nora does not argue that evidence of fraudulent intent\n\nwas entirely lacking but argues that her failure to disclose was\n\nnot material, an unpersuasive position given the reach of the\n\nmateriality concept.        It is not easy to support the district\n\ncourt's result on the basis of doubts not relied on by the district\n\ncourt in granting the motion, nor urged by the defendant herself on\n\nthis appeal.\n\n             Because Nora moved for a new trial in the district court-\n\n-a motion initially mooted by the directed judgment of acquittal--\n\n\n                                   -32-\n\fthat motion remains to be considered by the district court on\n\nremand. The district court, already disposed to grant an acquittal\n\noutright, may well be inclined to grant a new trial on weight-of-\nthe-evidence grounds.       United States v.
