VIGEANT,\n\n                          Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                                       v.\n\n                               UNITED STATES,\n\n                           Defendant, Appellee.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                   FOR THE DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND\n\n          [Hon. William E. Smith, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                    Before\n\n                         Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n              Campbell and Selya, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Robert A. Vigeant on brief pro se.\n     Steve Frank and Robert S. Greenspan, Appellate Staff, Civil\nDivision, Department of Justice, Peter D. Keisler, Assistant\nAttorney General, and Robert Clark Corrente, United States\nAttorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n                               August 7, 2007\n\f          Per Curiam.    Robert A. Vigeant appeals the district\n\ncourt's entry of summary judgment in favor of the government     in\n\nthis action brought under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. §§\n\n2671-80, asserting claims of false arrest, false imprisonment,\n\nmalicious prosecution and abuse of process based on the events\n\nleading to Vigeant's arrest and conviction for a firearms offense\n\nwhich was subsequently vacated by this court.1 See United States v.\n\nVigeant, 176 F.3d 565 (1st Cir. 1999).    We review the grant of\n\nsummary judgment de novo, drawing all reasonable inferences in\n\nfavor of the nonmoving party.   United States v. Union Bank for Sav.\n\n& Inv., 487 F.3d 8, 16-17 (1st Cir. 2007).      Summary judgment is\n\nproperly granted if the movant can demonstrate that \"there is no\n\ngenuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is\n\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"    Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\n\nHowever, \"where [the nonmoving] party bears the burden of proof, it\n\n'must present definite, competent evidence' from which a reasonable\n\njury could find in its favor.\"     Union Bank for Sav. & Inv., 487\n\n\n     1\n      The complaint asserted two additional claims that were\ndismissed early in the litigation: the first alleged that the\nsearch was unlawful, and the second was a claim brought by\nVigeant's now deceased grandmother for damages to her business.\nWhile Vigeant does not appear to challenge the dismissal of the\nfirst claim, he requests \"reinstatement\" of his grandmother's\nclaim. However, since Vigeant failed to raise a timely objection\nto the magistrate judge's recommendation to dismiss that claim,\nwhich was subsequently adopted by the district court, we will not\nreview it now. See 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(C); Negron v. Celebrity\nCruises, Inc., 316 F.3d 60, 61 (1st Cir. 2003).     The remaining\nissues raised on appeal relate to the summary judgment\ndetermination.\n\n                                 -2-\n\fF.3d at 16-17 (quoting United States v. One Parcel of Real Prop.,\n\n960 F.2d 200, 204 (1st Cir. 1992)).      To establish a claim for false\n\narrest, false imprisonment or malicious prosecution under Rhode\n\nIsland law, Vigeant was required to demonstrate, among other\n\nthings, a lack of probable cause for the criminal proceedings.\n\nBeaudoin v. Levesque, 697 A.2d 1065, 1067 (R.I. 1997).         While this\n\ncourt determined in the context of the direct criminal appeal that\n\nthe search warrant application was not supported by probable cause\n\nand   that   the   good-faith   exception    to   the   exclusionary   rule\n\ntherefore did not apply, we did not consider whether federal agents\n\nexecuting the search of Vigeant's home had probable cause to arrest\n\nhim when they discovered firearms.          See Vigeant, 176 F.3d at 569\n\n(expressly limiting inquiry to \"whether there was probable cause to\n\nbelieve that Vigeant had committed the crime of laundering drug\n\nproceeds, . . . as alleged in the affidavit [for the search warrant\n\napplication]\").\n\n             Vigeant argues that the determination that the agents did\n\nnot act in \"good faith\" in obtaining the search warrant also\n\nvitiates any probable cause that may have existed for his arrest\n\nfor the firearms offense; in other words, Vigeant contends that the\n\napplication of the exclusionary rule in the criminal proceedings\n\nwarrants application of the rule in this civil proceeding.             The\n\ndistrict court properly rejected this argument.          See Pennsylvania\n\nBd. of Probation & Parole v. Scott, 524 U.S. 357, 365 & n.4 (1998)\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\f(noting that the exclusionary rule generally has been held to apply\n\nonly in criminal proceedings); United States v. Calandra, 414 U.S.\n\n338,   347-48    (1974)      (stating    that    the    exclusionary     rule        is   a\n\nremedial device intended to deter future unlawful police conduct\n\nrather than a personal constitutional right, and that \"standing to\n\ninvoke   the    rule    has    been     confined       to   situations       where    the\n\ngovernment      seeks   to    incriminate       the     victim   of    the    unlawful\n\nsearch\").      See also Townes v. City of New York, 176 F.3d 138, 149\n\n(2d Cir. 1999) (holding, in a civil rights action, that the absence\n\nof probable cause for a stop and search did not vitiate the\n\nprobable cause to arrest plaintiff upon discovery of handguns in\n\nthe car in which he was riding).              For the reasons set forth by the\n\ndistrict court, we agree that the undisputed facts demonstrate that\n\nthe agents had probable cause to believe Vigeant was a felon in\n\npossession of firearms, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g).                           The\n\ngovernment was therefore entitled to summary judgment on the claims\n\nfor false arrest, false imprisonment and malicious prosecution.\n\n            We also agree with the district court's determination\n\nthat Vigeant failed to produce evidence of any ulterior motive or\n\nwrongful purpose for his arrest beyond spite or malevolence, as is\n\nrequired to prove a claim for abuse of process.                       See Butera v.\n\nBoucher, 798 A.2d 340, 354 (R.I. 2002) (\"The gist of an abuse-of-\n\nprocess claim is the misuse of legal process to obtain an advantage\n\n'not   properly    involved      in     the    proceeding     itself     .    .   .   .\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\f[However], even a pure spite motive is not sufficient where process\n\nis used only to accomplish the result for which it was created.'\"\n\n(quoting W. Page Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on the Law of\n\nTorts § 121, at 897 (5th ed. 1984)) (emphasis in original).\n\nDefendant was therefore also entitled to summary judgment on the\n\nabuse of process claim.\n\n          Accordingly, essentially for the reasons set forth in the\n\ndistrict court's October 19, 2006, Decision and Order, we affirm.\n\nSee 1st Cir. R. 27.0(c).\n\n\n\n\n                               -5-\n\f",
