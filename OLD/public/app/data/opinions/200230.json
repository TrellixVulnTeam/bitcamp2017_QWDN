Carmen Gloria Santos\n\nEspada (“Santos”) brought this diversity-of-citizenship action\n\nagainst Dr.      Jaime   Cancel   Lugo,       claiming   that   Dr.    Cancel   had\n\ncommitted medical malpractice under Article 1802 of the Puerto Rico\n\nCivil Code.      Santos contends that Dr. Cancel acted negligently in\n\nperforming a modified radical mastectomy that included the excision\n\nof 14 lymph nodes, causing lymphedema in her right arm.\n\n              When the case went to trial, Dr. Cancel moved under Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. (\"Rule”) 50(a) for judgment as a matter of law when\n\nSantos had completed her proofs and rested.                     That motion was\n\ngranted on statute of limitations grounds, and the action was\n\ntherefore dismissed.       Santos appeals, and we reverse the district\n\ncourt's judgment and remand for further proceedings in light of\n\nthis opinion.\n\n                            Standard of Review\n\n              We review the grant of a Rule 50(a) motion for judgment\n\nas a matter of law de novo, using the same standards as the\n\ndistrict court (Andrade v. Jamestown Hous. Auth., 82 F.3d 1179,\n\n1186   (1st    Cir.   1996)).     All    of    the   evidence    and   reasonable\n\ninferences drawn from the evidence are thus considered in the light\n\nmost favorable to nonmovant Santos (id.), and we take that approach\n\nin the Facts discussion below.\n\n              As for the legal standard to be applied to the facts,\n\nAndrade, id. (internal quotation marks omitted) spoke in terms of\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fthe older Rule 50(a) “directed verdict” language (which embodied\n\nthe same concept) to teach that a “verdict may be directed only if\n\nthe evidence, viewed from this perspective [most favorable to the\n\nnonmovant], would not permit a reasonable jury to find in favor of\n\nthe plaintiff[ ] on any permissible claim or theory.”            If instead\n\nfair-minded    persons   could   draw   different   inferences    from   the\n\nevidence presented at trial, the matter is for the jury (Santiago\n\nHodge v. Parke Davis & Co., 909 F.2d 628, 634 (1st Cir. 1990)).\n\n                                  Facts\n\n          On May 27, 1997 Santos underwent a right modified radical\n\nmastectomy, performed by Dr. Cancel at Hospital Pavia in San Juan,\n\nPuerto Rico.     That procedure included the removal of remaining\n\nbreast tissue, as well as the axillary contents of 14 lymph nodes\n\nthat were free of tumor.     Santos was never warned of the risks of\n\nremoving those axillary contents or of the effects that such a\n\nprocedure may have, nor was she advised about the appropriate\n\nmeasures to take regarding her arm.         Approximately a week after\n\nsurgery, Dr. Cancel told Santos that 14 lymph nodes had been\n\nremoved during surgery.\n\n          In July 1997 Santos visited Dr. Cancel to inquire about\n\nsome swelling of her right arm.         Dr. Cancel told her that it was\n\nnothing. During other July appointments Dr. Cancel never mentioned\n\nthe possibility of swelling or lymphedema to Santos.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\f          In November 1997 Santos was told that she had lymphedema\n\nby a doctor in a Florida hospital.                 Santos began treatment for\n\nlymphedema by December 1997.             Next Santos met with a lymphedema\n\nspecialist    in    April    or   May    1998.      In   the   meantime    she   had\n\ncommunicated       with    the    National      Lymphedema     Network    in   1997,\n\nreceiving some information about lymphedema.\n\n             On July 21, 1999 oncologists at the Veterans Hospital in\n\nTampa, Florida first informed Santos that the procedure used for\n\nher intraductal carcinoma, the modified radical mastectomy, was not\n\nthe recommended procedure.           Those physicians also identified the\n\nmodified radical mastectomy and removal of the 14 lymph nodes as\n\nthe reason for the development of the lymphedema.\n\n             On May 30, 2000 Santos filed a complaint alleging medical\n\nmalpractice in the course of the May 27, 1997 surgery.                    Trial by\n\njury began on July 16, 2001.                 When Santos rested her case, Dr.\n\nCancel moved for dismissal of the action under Rule 50(a) on the\n\ngrounds   that       the    cause       of    action     was   time-barred       and,\n\nalternatively, that Santos had failed to satisfy her evidentiary\n\nburden in her case in chief.            In a July 17 order (Santos Espada v.\n\nCancel Lugo, 165 F. Supp. 2d 76 (D.P.R. 2001)) the District Court\n\ndismissed the action with prejudice by finding that Santos knew of\n\nher injury as early as 1997 or 1998 and also that Santos “should\n\nhave known during the course of her treatment for lymphedema that\n\nthe excision of the axillary contents of 14 lymph nodes may not\n\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fhave been necessary given the nature of [Santos’] breast cancer”\n\n(id. at 78).    That order did not address Dr. Cancel's other Rule\n\n50(a) argument that Santos had failed to satisfy her evidentiary\n\nburden.\n\n                Statute of Limitations Considerations\n\n          This diversity action looks to the Puerto Rico Civil\n\nCode, which sets a one-year statute of limitations for personal\n\ninjury claims (31 P.R. Laws Ann. §5298(2); see also Ramos-Baez v.\n\nBossolo-Lopez, 240 F.3d 92, 93 (1st Cir. 2001)).        That one-year\n\ntime clock begins to tick on the day after the date of accrual of\n\nthe claim (Carreras-Rosa v. Alves-Cruz, 127 F.3d 172, 175 (1st Cir.\n\n1997)(per curiam)). Because Santos filed suit on May 30, 2000, its\n\ntimeliness therefore depends on a date of accrual no later than\n\nMay 30, 1999.\n\n          For accrual purposes, the injured person must have both\n\nnotice of her injury and knowledge of the likely identity of the\n\ntortfeasor (Tokyo Marine & Fire Ins. Co. v. Perez y Cia. de Puerto\n\nRico, Inc., 142 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1998)).    We therefore examine\n\nwhen both of those elements were present in this case.\n\n          Notice of an injury occurs when there “exist some outward\n\nor physical signs through which the aggrieved party may become\n\naware and realize that [s]he has suffered an injurious aftereffect”\n\n(Kaiser v. Armstrong World Indus., Inc., 872 F.2d 512, 516 (1st\n\nCir. 1989), quoting Puerto Rico authorities).    Santos gained such\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fnotice of her injury at the latest by November 1997, when the\n\nswelling in her arm was diagnosed as lymphedema.\n\n           But such a diagnosis of lymphedema is not necessarily\n\nsufficient for knowledge that a tortfeasor was involved as well.\n\nColon Prieto v. Geigel, 115 P.R. Dec. 232, 15 P.R. Offic. Trans.\n\n313 (1984) teaches that “not only must the aggrieved person know\n\nthat [s]he has been injured; [s]he must know who is the author of\n\nthe injury in order to address the action against him, so [s]he may\n\nknow who to sue” (15 Offic. Trans. at 330)(internal quotation marks\n\nomitted; emphasis in original).     And Galarza v. Zagury, 739 F.2d\n\n20, 24 (1st Cir. 1984) has read Colon Prieto as making “clear that\n\nknowledge of the author of the harm means more than an awareness of\n\nsome ill effects resulting from an operation by a particular\n\ndoctor.”     From   that   it   follows   that   (Rodriguez-Suris   v.\n\nMontesinos, 123 F.3d 10, 13-14 (1st Cir. 1997)):\n\n                  If a plaintiff is not aware of some level of\n           reasonable likelihood of legal liability on the\n           part of the person or entity that caused the\n           injury, the statute of limitation will be tolled.\n\n           It was only when Santos knew that the lymphedema may have\n\nbeen caused by an improper surgical procedure that she also had\n\nactual knowledge of the possibility that Dr. Cancel was the author\n\nof her injury--that is, enough to provide a causal nexus between\n\nDr. Cancel's conduct and the injury.      That knowledge came on July\n\n21, 1999, when Santos first learned that Dr. Cancel's removal of 14\n\nlymph nodes was not a recommended procedure.       And that knowledge\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fthat Dr. Cancel had increased the likelihood of Santos developing\n\nlymphedema meant that the injury could be considered a tort rather\n\nthan an expected side effect (see, e.g., Villarini-Garcia v.\n\nHospital Del Maestro, Inc., 8 F.3d 81, 85-87 (1st Cir. 1993);\n\nGalarza, 739 F.2d at 21-24).\n\n              But the limitations period can begin to run not simply\n\nwhen a claimant gains “actual knowledge” but at an earlier date\n\nwhen “by due diligence, such knowledge would likely have been\n\nacquired”       (Rodriguez-Suris,        123     F.3d    at         16,   quoting\n\nVillarini-Garcia, 8 F.3d at 84).             In cases where a tort claim is\n\nfiled beyond the one-year statutory term, plaintiff bears the\n\nburden of proving timeliness by establishing that she lacked the\n\nnecessary knowledge or imputed knowledge before instituting the\n\naction (Torres v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co., 219 F.3d 13, 19\n\n(1st Cir. 2001)).         And for that purpose the question whether the\n\nplaintiff has exercised reasonable diligence is typically given to\n\nthe jury, “even where no raw facts are in dispute,” because “the\n\nissues of due diligence and adequate knowledge are still ones for\n\nthe    jury   so   long   as   the   outcome   is   within    the    range   where\n\nreasonable men and women can differ” (Villarini-Garcia, 8 F.3d at\n\n87).\n\n              Moreover, the statute of limitations can be tolled “[i]f\n\na plaintiff’s suspicions that she may have been the victim of a\n\ntort are assuaged by the person who caused the injury” (Rodriguez-\n\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fSuris, 123 F.3d at 16, citing Colon Prieto, 15 P.R. Offic. Trans.\n\nat 329-30).     Finally, such tolling may be halted by further\n\ninformation that renders plaintiff’s reliance on those assurances\n\nno longer reasonable, so that plaintiff then has an obligation of\n\ndiligent investigation (Rodriguez-Suris, 123 F.3d at 17).\n\n            How do those principles play out in this case?    Santos\n\nknew shortly after the operation that 14 lymph nodes had been\n\nremoved and that her right arm was swelling.    But she was promptly\n\nreassured by Dr. Cancel, the surgeon who had performed the surgery,\n\nthat the swelling in her arm was nothing and that the incision\n\nlooked good. Consequently Santos was initially entitled to rely on\n\nthe analysis from her doctor that the operation had been performed\n\nproperly.\n\n            Because the swelling persisted, however, Santos continued\n\nher investigation and discovered that the swelling in her arm was\n\nlymphedema.   It would surely be permissible for a jury to find that\n\nSantos was diligent in her investigation of the cause of her\n\nlymphedema by communicating with the National Lymphedema Network\n\nand by meeting with other doctors in her attempt to discover the\n\ncause of her lymphedema.1\n\n     1\n        Because the trial testimony of Santos' expert witness Dr.\nRobert De Jager (a specialist whose extensive curriculum vitae,\nincluded in the record on appeal, reflects credentials that support\nthe district court's Fed. R. Evid. 702 admission of his testimony\nas an expert), has not been transcribed for inclusion in the\nappellate record, what is said hereafter in this opinion regarding\nlymphedema is drawn from Dr. De Jager's Rule 26(a)(2)(B) expert\nreport (included in the pretrial order in the case).\n\n                                 -8-\n\f           Lymphedema is a possible outcome any time a lymph node is\n\nremoved, and it is thus a common side effect from breast cancer\n\nsurgery.   Lymphedema can stem from the removal of lymph nodes from\n\na radical mastectomy, either from a single lymph node (as Santos\n\nclaims is conventional and recommended practice) or from the\n\nremoval of as many as 14 lymph nodes (as occurred in this case).\n\nHence a jury could reasonably conclude that Santos’ investigation\n\ninto the     cause    of   the    lymphedema    would    not   necessarily    have\n\ntriggered further inquiry as to whether the excision of 14 lymph\n\nnodes was actionably wrongful.\n\n     Here Santos clearly knew more than one year before the suit\n\nwas filed that a serious and persistent affliction had followed her\n\nsurgery and that Dr. Cancel was responsible for the surgery.                   But\n\nlymphedema can occur after properly done surgery, and Santos had no\n\nreason to know or suspect, until she was so told on July 21, 1999,\n\nthat less radical surgery had been a reasonable and less risky\n\nalternative--or so the jury could permissibly conclude--so the jury\n\ndid not have to find that the statute barred her claim.                      It is\n\nworth stressing that on somewhat different facts, an unexpected\n\nadverse consequence from an operation could well be sufficiently\n\nsuspicious that a plaintiff would have to pursue that possibility\n\ndiligently    at     the   risk    of   being   barred    by   the   statute    of\n\nlimitations.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\f           We should not be misunderstood as signaling the actual\n\noutcome of the necessary factual inquiry. It is rather that Santos\n\nis entitled to the benefit of her version of events in resisting a\n\nRule 50(a) judgment as a matter of law.          And on that version a\n\nreasonable factfinder could determine that Santos, despite the\n\nexercise   of   due   diligence   in   investigating   and   treating   her\n\nlymphedema, obtained the requisite knowledge only when she learned\n\nof Dr. Cancel's possible malpractice on July 21, 1999.            Because\n\nJuly 21, 1999 is less than one year before the May 30, 2000 date of\n\nfiling, Santos' claim is not barred by limitations as a matter of\n\nlaw.\n\n                        Santos' Appellate Relief\n\n           As stated earlier, Dr. Cancel's Rule 50(a) motion at the\n\nconclusion of Santos' case in chief was predicated not only on\n\nlimitations grounds but on a claimed failure of proof sufficient to\n\njustify submission to the jury.        From Dr. De Jager's report (see\n\nn.1) there may well have been enough evidence to support such\n\nsubmission, but the district judge did not reach that issue, and it\n\nhas not been briefed before us.           Hence a determination of that\n\nissue by the district court on remand is called for.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\f                            Conclusion\n\n          We therefore REVERSE the order of the district court\n\ngranting Dr. Cancel’s Rule 50(a) motion for judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw.   We REMAND the case to the district court for further\n\nproceedings in light of this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                               -11-\n\f",

Geigel,</i> 115 P.R. Dec. 232, 15 P.R. Offic. Trans. 313, 1984 WL 270950 (1984) teaches that \"not only must the aggrieved person know that [s]he has been injured; <i>[s]he must know who is the author of the injury</i> in order to address the action against him, so [s]he may know who to sue\" (15 Offic. Trans. at 330)(internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis in original). And <i>Galarza v. Zagury,</i> 739 F.2d 20, 24 (1st Cir.1984) has read <i>Colon Prieto</i> as making \"clear that knowledge of the author of the harm means more than an awareness of some ill effects resulting from an operation by a particular doctor.\" From that it follows that (<i>Rodriguez-Suris v. Montesinos,</i> 123 F.3d 10, 13-14 (1st Cir.1997)):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If a plaintiff is not aware of some level of reasonable likelihood of legal liability on the part of the person or entity that caused the injury, the statute of limitation will be tolled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was only when Santos knew that the lymphedema may have been caused by an improper surgical procedure that she also had actual knowledge of the possibility that Dr. Cancel was the author of her injury &#8212; that is, enough to provide a causal nexus between Dr. Cancel's conduct and the injury. That knowledge came on July 21, 1999, when Santos first learned that Dr. Cancel's removal of 14 lymph nodes was not a recommended procedure. And that knowledge that Dr. Cancel had increased the likelihood of Santos developing lymphedema meant that the injury could be considered a tort rather than an expected side effect (<i>see, e.g., Villarini-Garcia v. Hospital Del Maestro, Inc.,</i> 8 F.3d 81, 85-87 (1st Cir.1993); <i>Galarza,</i> 739 F.2d at 21-24).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the limitations period can begin to run not simply when a claimant gains \"actual knowledge\" but at an earlier date when \"by due diligence, such knowledge would likely have been acquired\" (<i>Rodriguez-Suris,</i> 123 F.3d at 16, quoting <i>Villarini-Garcia,</i> 8 F.3d at 84). In cases where a tort claim is filed beyond the one-year statutory term, plaintiff bears the burden of proving timeliness by establishing that she lacked the necessary knowledge or imputed knowledge before instituting the action (<i>Torres v. E.I. Dupont De Nemours &amp; Co.,</i> 219 F.3d 13, 19 (1st Cir.2001)). And for that purpose the question whether the plaintiff has exercised reasonable diligence is typically given to the jury, \"even where no raw facts are in dispute,\" because \"the issues of due diligence and adequate knowledge are still ones for the jury so long as the outcome is within the range where reasonable men and women can differ\" (<i>Villarini-Garcia,</i> 8 F.3d at 87).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the statute of limitations can be tolled \"[i]f a plaintiff's suspicions that she may have been the victim of a tort are assuaged by the person who caused the injury\" (<i>Rodriguez-Suris,</i> 123 F.3d at 16, citing <i>Colon Prieto,</i> 15 P.R. Offic. Trans. at 329-30). Finally, such tolling may be halted by further information that renders plaintiff's reliance on those assurances no longer reasonable, so that plaintiff then has an obligation of diligent investigation (<i>Rodriguez-Suris,</i> 123 F.3d at 17).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">How do those principles play out in this case? Santos knew shortly after the operation that 14 lymph nodes had been removed and that her right arm was swelling. But she was promptly reassured by Dr. Cancel, the surgeon who had performed the surgery, that the swelling in her arm was nothing and that the incision looked good. Consequently Santos was initially entitled to rely on the analysis from her doctor that the operation had been performed properly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the swelling persisted, however, Santos continued her investigation and discovered that the swelling in her arm was lymphedema. It would surely be permissible for a jury to find that Santos was diligent in her investigation of the cause of her lymphedema by communicating with the National Lymphedema Network and by meeting with other doctors in her attempt to discover the cause of her lymphedema.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lymphedema is a possible outcome any time a lymph node is removed, and it is thus a common side effect from breast cancer surgery. Lymphedema can stem from the removal of lymph nodes from a radical mastectomy, either from a single lymph node (as Santos claims is conventional and recommended practice) or from the removal of as many as 14 lymph nodes (as occurred in this case). Hence a jury could reasonably conclude that Santos' investigation into the cause of the lymphedema would not necessarily have triggered further inquiry as to whether the excision of 14 lymph nodes was actionably wrongful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here Santos clearly knew more than one year before the suit was filed that a serious and persistent affliction had followed her surgery and that Dr. Cancel was responsible for the surgery. But lymphedema can occur after properly done surgery, and Santos had no reason to know or suspect, until she was so told on July 21, 1999, that less radical surgery had been a reasonable and less risky alternative &#8212; or so the jury could permissibly conclude &#8212; so the jury did not have to find that the statute barred her claim. It is worth stressing that on somewhat different facts, an unexpected adverse consequence from an operation could well be sufficiently suspicious that a plaintiff would have to pursue that possibility diligently at the risk of being barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We should not be misunderstood as signaling the actual outcome of the necessary factual inquiry. It is rather that Santos is entitled to the benefit of her version of events in resisting a Rule 50(a) judgment as a matter of law. And on that version a reasonable factfinder could determine that Santos, despite the exercise of due diligence in investigating and treating her lymphedema, obtained the requisite knowledge only when she learned of Dr. Cancel's possible malpractice on July 21, 1999. Because July 21, 1999 is less than one year before the May 30, 2000 date of filing, Santos' claim is not barred by limitations as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Santos' Appellate Relief</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As stated earlier, Dr. Cancel's Rule 50(a) motion at the conclusion of Santos' case in chief was predicated not only on limitations grounds but on a claimed failure of proof sufficient to justify submission to the jury. From Dr. De Jager's report (see n.1) there may well have been enough evidence to support such submission, but the district judge did not reach that issue, and it has not been briefed before us.

And that knowledge that Dr. Cancel had increased the likelihood of Santos developing lymphedema meant that the injury could be considered a tort rather than an expected side effect (<i>see, e.g., Villarini-Garcia v. Hospital Del Maestro, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194998\"><a href=\"/opinion/194998/villarini-garcia-v-hospital-del-maestro/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span>, 85-87 (1st Cir.1993); <i>Galarza,</i> 739 F.2d at 21-24).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the limitations period can begin to run not simply when a claimant gains \"actual knowledge\" but at an earlier date when \"by due diligence, such knowledge would likely have been acquired\" (<i>Rodriguez-Suris,</i> 123 F.3d at 16, quoting <i>Villarini-Garcia,</i> 8 F.3d at 84). In cases where a tort claim is filed beyond the one-year statutory term, plaintiff bears the burden of proving timeliness by establishing that she lacked the necessary knowledge or imputed knowledge before instituting the action (<i>Torres v. E.I. Dupont De Nemours &amp; Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199000\"><a href=\"/opinion/199000/torres-v-ei-dupont/\"><span class=\"volume\">219</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 19 (1st Cir.2001)). And for that purpose the question whether the plaintiff has exercised reasonable diligence is typically given to the jury, \"even where no raw facts are in dispute,\" because \"the issues of due diligence and adequate knowledge are still ones for the jury so long as the outcome is within the range where reasonable men and women can differ\" (<i>Villarini-Garcia,</i> 8 F.3d at 87).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the statute of limitations can be tolled \"[i]f a plaintiff's suspicions that she may have been the victim of a tort are assuaged by the person who caused the injury\" (<i>Rodriguez-Suris,</i> 123 F.3d at 16, citing <i>Colon Prieto,</i> 15 P.R. Offic. Trans. at 329-30). Finally, such tolling may be halted by further information that renders plaintiff's reliance on those assurances no longer reasonable, so that plaintiff then has an obligation of diligent investigation (<i>Rodriguez-Suris,</i> 123 F.3d at 17).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">How do those principles play out in this case? Santos knew shortly after the operation that 14 lymph nodes had been removed and that her right arm was swelling. But she was promptly reassured by Dr. Cancel, the surgeon who had performed the surgery, that the swelling in her arm was nothing and that the incision looked good. Consequently Santos was initially entitled to rely on the analysis from her doctor that the operation had been performed properly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the swelling persisted, however, Santos continued her investigation and discovered that the swelling in her arm was lymphedema. It would surely be permissible for a jury to find that Santos was diligent in her investigation of the cause of her lymphedema by communicating with the National Lymphedema Network and by meeting with other doctors in her attempt to discover the cause of her lymphedema.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lymphedema is a possible outcome any time a lymph node is removed, and it is thus a common side effect from breast cancer surgery. Lymphedema can stem from the removal of lymph nodes from a radical mastectomy, either from a single lymph node (as Santos claims is conventional and recommended practice) or from the removal of as many as 14 lymph nodes (as occurred in this case). Hence a jury could reasonably conclude that Santos' investigation into the cause of the lymphedema would not necessarily have triggered further inquiry as to whether the excision of 14 lymph nodes was actionably wrongful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here Santos clearly knew more than one year before the suit was filed that a serious and persistent affliction had followed her surgery and that Dr. Cancel was responsible for the surgery. But lymphedema can occur after properly done surgery, and Santos had no reason to know or suspect, until she was so told on July 21, 1999, that less radical surgery had been a reasonable and less risky alternative &#8212; or so the jury could permissibly conclude &#8212; so the jury did not have to find that the statute barred her claim. It is worth stressing that on somewhat different facts, an unexpected adverse consequence from an operation could well be sufficiently suspicious that a plaintiff would have to pursue that possibility diligently at the risk of being barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We should not be misunderstood as signaling the actual outcome of the necessary factual inquiry. It is rather that Santos is entitled to the benefit of her version of events in resisting a Rule 50(a) judgment as a matter of law. And on that version a reasonable factfinder could determine that Santos, despite the exercise of due diligence in investigating and treating her lymphedema, obtained the requisite knowledge only when she learned of Dr. Cancel's possible malpractice on July 21, 1999. Because July 21, 1999 is less than one year before the May 30, 2000 date of filing, Santos' claim is not barred by limitations as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Santos' Appellate Relief</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As stated earlier, Dr. Cancel's Rule 50(a) motion at the conclusion of Santos' case in chief was predicated not only on limitations grounds but on a claimed failure of proof sufficient to justify submission to the jury. From Dr. De Jager's report (see n.1) there may well have been enough evidence to support such submission, but the district judge did not reach that issue, and it has not been briefed before us. Hence a determination of that issue by the district court on remand is called for.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Conclusion</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore REVERSE the order of the district court granting Dr. Cancel's Rule 50(a) motion for judgment as a matter of law. We REMAND the case to the district court for further proceedings in light of this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of Illinois, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Because the trial testimony of Santos' expert witness Dr. Robert De Jager (a specialist whose extensive curriculum vitae, included in the record on appeal, reflects credentials that support the district court's Fed.R.Evid. 702 admission of his testimony as an expert), has not been transcribed for inclusion in the appellate record, what is said hereafter in this opinion regarding lymphedema is drawn from Dr. De Jager's Rule 26(a)(2)(B) expert report (included in the pretrial order in the case)</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
