Plaintiff Bruce Jackson brought suit under\n\n42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988, challenging the procedures associated\n\nwith the termination of his employment.             That termination was,\n\nhowever, still subject to challenge in various administrative\n\nproceedings and in arbitration under the collective bargaining\n\nagreement.      The   district   court      dismissed     his   complaint   with\n\nprejudice.    Jackson appealed.\n\n           At oral argument, this court was informed that the\n\narbitration regarding Jackson's termination is underway and that\n\nthe   reinstatement    of   Jackson    is    a   remedy    available   to    the\n\narbitrator.     The court inquired of the parties whether, in a\n\npractical sense, the case might be mooted by the arbitrator's\n\ndecision, and urged the parties to consider a stipulated resolution\n\nthat would preserve the rights of both sides.\n\n             On October 20, 2003, the parties filed with the court a\n\nstipulation that the matter be remanded to the district court for\n\ndismissal without prejudice and that Jackson will no longer pursue\n\nthe appeal in this action.\n\n             The equitable decision on vacatur of a district court\n\norder rests in the discretion of this court.

Under the\n\ncircumstances of this case, we think it appropriate to vacate the\n\norder of dismissal with prejudice and remand with instructions to\n\nthe district court to enter a dismissal without prejudice.
