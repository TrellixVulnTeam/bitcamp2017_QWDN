This is petition for\n\nreview of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"Board\"),\n\nbrought by members of the same family, seeking to overturn orders\n\nfor their removal from the United States to their home country of\n\nColombia.      We affirm the order of the Board.\n\n            As the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\") has\n\ndetermined,     the    \"lead   file\"   is    that    of   Elkin   Edisson   Muriel\n\nVelasquez; the other appellants are all members of his family, and\n\ntheir claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection\n\nunder the Convention Against Torture, rise or fall on the merits of\n\nVelasquez's like claims.          We accordingly focus on the facts and\n\nmerits of Velasquez's case, these being determinative of the\n\nothers' as well.\n\n            Velasquez was most recently admitted to the United States\n\non July 9, 1996 on a nonimmigrant business visa.              His visa expired,\n\nbut he nonetheless remained in this country. On December 22, 1999,\n\nthe INS commenced removal proceedings against him by issuing a\n\nNotice to Appear charging Velasquez with removability pursuant to\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B) as an alien who remained in the United\n\nStates for a time longer than permitted.             On August 18, 1999, James\n\nC.   Dragon,    an    attorney,   prepared     and    filed   with   the    INS   an\n\napplication on behalf of Velasquez for asylum, withholding of\n\nremoval, and protection under the Convention Against Torture.\n\nRepresented by Dragon, Velasquez appeared on March 7, 2000 before\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fan Immigration Judge (\"IJ\"), conceded removability, and entered his\n\nasylum application and supporting documents.    On May 4, 2000, at a\n\nhearing before an IJ, Velasquez testified to the following effect.\n\n            Velasquez owned a store in Itagui, Colombia between 1994\n\nand December of 1996.     During that time, he visited the United\n\nStates on numerous occasions on visitor's visas.     In December of\n\n1995, members of an organization known as Populares Milicias\n\nphysically assaulted him and requested that he pay to them a \"war\n\ntax\" so that he could receive protection from theft or further\n\nviolence. He paid the war tax several times, the payments totaling\n\n8 million pesos.    At one point, he was unable to pay the war tax,\n\nand he thereafter suffered another physical assault and a store\n\nrobbery. He reported the incidents to the police, who installed an\n\ninternal alarm to curb further robberies.   After its installation,\n\nVelasquez suffered no further physical assaults or robberies.\n\nNevertheless, he feared the Populares Milicias and decided in April\n\nof 1996 that he wanted to stay in the United States indefinitely\n\nuntil conditions improved in Colombia.    He returned to the United\n\nStates in    July of 1996 and remained beyond the amount of time\n\npermitted in his visa.   In \"the middle of 1998\" friends and family\n\nmembers called Velasquez stating that people, presumably members of\n\nPopulares Milicias, were asking about his whereabouts. By December\n\nof 1998, he had given up hope of ever returning safely to Colombia,\n\nso he decided to seek information regarding his ability to stay\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\flegally in the United States.    At that time, upon the advice of a\n\nfriend, he met \"Mr. Ansara,\" whom he believed could help him with\n\nhis immigration case.    While Velasquez referred to Ansara as a\n\nlawyer, he conceded that Ansara never told him he was a lawyer.\n\nAfter this initial meeting, Velasquez was able to meet with Ansara\n\nonly one more time before Ansara disappeared.        Four months after\n\ndiscovering Ansara's disappearance, Velasquez retained Dragon as\n\nhis attorney.\n\n          Based on this testimony, Dragon argued to the IJ that\n\nVelasquez's asylum application was not subject to the one-year\n\nfiling deadline set forth in 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B)1 because of\n\nchanged and extraordinary circumstances.   8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(D)\n\n(providing exceptions to one-year filing deadline when petitioner\n\nhas   established   \"changed   circumstances\"   or      \"extraordinary\n\ncircumstances\").    In particular, Velasquez argued that since he\n\nbegan to realize only in the summer of 1998 (when he learned that\n\nmembers of Populares Milicias were still looking for him) that the\n\ncountry conditions in Colombia had changed such that his problems\n\nthere were not going to abate, it was impossible for him to have\n\nfiled an application for asylum by the one-year deadline, which\n\n\n      1\n      Section 1158(a)(1) states, \"[a]ny alien who is physically\npresent in the United States or who arrives in the United States.\n. . may apply for asylum . . . .\" Section 1158(a)(2)(B) states,\nhowever, that \"paragraph (1) shall not apply to an alien unless the\nalien demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the\napplication has been filed within 1 year after the date of the\nalien's arrival in the United States.\"\n\n                                 -4-\n\fexpired   on    April      1,   1998.2      He   further    argued     that   these\n\nconstituted     extraordinary          circumstances,       or      events    beyond\n\nVelasquez's control, that made it impossible for Velasquez to meet\n\nthe filing deadline.            He noted that Velasquez filed his asylum\n\napplication in July of 1999, which he said was shortly after these\n\ndevelopments came to light.\n\n           At the end of the hearing, on May 4, 2000, the IJ issued\n\nher oral decision. She concluded that Velasquez had established no\n\nbasis for her to apply the changed or extraordinary circumstances\n\nexceptions     to    the    one-year     deadline   for    asylum    applications.\n\nAccordingly,        she    pretermitted     Velasquez's     asylum     application\n\npursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B).               The IJ, nevertheless, went\n\non \"in the alternative\" to consider the merits of the asylum claim,\n\ntogether with the withholding of removal and Convention Against\n\nTorture claims, which did not have specific filing deadlines.                    The\n\nIJ commented that, \"[m]uch of the evidence, essentially, is the\n\nsame for all three forms of relief . . . .             [Velasquez] stated that\n\nhe had no additional evidence on the issue of withholding or relief\n\nunder Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture.\"\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      The basis for the IJ's conclusion that the one-year deadline\nexpired on April 1, 1998 does not appear in the record, nor is it\nexplained in the briefs.     Possibly the arrival dates of other\nfamily members are relevant.         The parties, including the\ngovernment, do not dispute that the deadline expired on that date,\nhence we accept it as controlling.\n\n                                          -5-\n\f          The   IJ   rejected   Velasquez's   contention   that   he   was\n\npersecuted for his membership in a particular social group or for\n\nhis political opinion, requirements set out in the INS's relevant\n\nregulation, 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(a).       Threats and   injuries at the\n\nhands of the Populares Milicias were not, in her view, shown to\n\nhave been on account of his political opinion.        Nor did she find\n\nthat Velasquez had shown he belonged to a particular \"social group\"\n\n-- at most, he was a member of the merchant class, which was not\n\nenough.\n\n          Most importantly, the IJ questioned the consistency of\n\nVelasquez's testimony.      She wondered whether he truly feared\n\nPopulares Milicias in light of his willingness to repeatedly return\n\nto Colombia even after he was forced to pay the war tax.          In any\n\nevent, having been both assaulted and threatened as early as in\n\n1995, he was well aware of that group's threat several years prior\n\nto the expiration of the time for his seeking asylum.       She further\n\nstated:\n\n          As to [Velasquez's] credibility, I find that\n          he may be telling the truth about these\n          various assaults; he does have some police\n          reports in corroboration.     The respondent,\n          however, I believe is not credible when he\n          makes wild speculations such as the people, in\n          fact, who had extorted from him. There's no\n          foundation for that . . . In general, I do not\n          find the respondent to be particularly\n          credible.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fIn the IJ's opinion, Velasquez and his family relocated to the\n\nUnited States, not out of fear, but because it provided better\n\n\"prospects.\"\n\n           The IJ concluded that Velasquez was not eligible for\n\nasylum, withholding of removal, or relief under the Convention\n\nAgainst Torture.       She denied Velasquez's application and ordered\n\nhis removal to Colombia.      Velasquez timely appealed to the Board.\n\nOn November 19, 2002, the Board affirmed the IJ's order without\n\nopinion.   Velasquez did not petition this Court for review of the\n\nBoard's affirmance.      8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(1).       However, on December\n\n17, 2002, Velasquez timely filed with the Board a motion styled as\n\none to reopen.3        Velasquez argued that         his discovery from a\n\nNovember 25, 2002 letter that attorney Dragon had been disbarred on\n\nAugust   23,   20024   constituted   a     \"new   fact\"   under   8   C.F.R.   §\n\n\n     3\n      While the motion was styled as a \"Motion to Reopen,\"      it\nappears also to have been a motion for reconsideration as, in\naddition to having raised new facts that would allegedly merit\nreopening, it contained arguments that the Board erred as a matter\nof fact or law.     8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c) (\"A motion to reopen\nproceedings shall state the new facts that will be proven at a\nhearing to be held if the motion is granted and shall be supported\nby affidavits or other evidentiary material.\"); Zhang v. INS, 348\nF.3d 289, 293 (1st Cir. 2003) (\"The purpose of a motion to\nreconsider is not to raise new facts, but to demonstrate that the\n[Board] erred as a matter of law or fact.\"). The Board, itself,\ninterpreted the motion as a motion to \"reopen and reconsider.\" In\nkeeping with the Board's reading of Velasquez's motion, we shall\ntreat it as if it were two motions -- a motion to reopen and a\nmotion to reconsider.\n     4\n      It does not appear, and Velasquez does not contend, that\nDragon acted as Velasquez's attorney after having been disbarred.\nDragon was disbarred on August 23, 2002 -- between the filing of\n\n                                     -7-\n\f103.4(a)(2) meriting reopening.       He further argued that the IJ\n\nerred as a matter of law in denying the asylum and related\n\napplications.   On April 17, 2003, the Board denied the motion, and\n\nVelasquez timely petitioned for review by this Court.    8 U.S.C. §\n\n1252(b).\n\nI.         Motion to Reopen\n\n           We first review the Board's denial of Velasquez's motion\n\nto reopen.\n\n           A motion to reopen proceedings shall not be\n           granted unless it appears to the Board that\n           evidence sought to be offered is material and\n           was not available and could not have been\n           discovered or presented at the former hearing;\n           nor shall any motion to reopen for the purpose\n           of affording the alien an opportunity to apply\n           for any form of discretionary relief be\n           granted if it appears that the alien's right\n           to apply for such relief was fully explained\n           to him or her and an opportunity to apply\n           therefore was afforded at the former hearing,\n           unless the relief is sought on the basis of\n           circumstances that have arisen subsequent to\n           the hearing.\n\n\n\n\nVelasquez's initial appeal from the IJ's order to the Board in June\nof 2000 and the issuance of the Board's affirmance of that order on\nNovember 19, 2002. On November 25, 2002, less than a week after\nthe Board's ruling, Velasquez received the letter informing him of\nDragon's disbarment. Velasquez immediately retained Walter Gleason\nas his new attorney. Gleason then filed the motion to reopen and\nreconsider addressed to the Board.\n     Velasquez does not argue that Dragon is to blame for his\nfailure to file a petition for review of the Board's November 19,\n2002 order. Indeed, it appears that he had retained Gleason prior\nto the expiration date to file such a petition.         8 U.S.C. §\n1252(b)(1)(generally allowing 30 days after date of order of\nremoval for filing of petition for review of order).\n\n                                -8-\n\f8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c), formerly codified in 8 C.F.R. § 3.2(c); see\n\nalso Zhang,     348   F.3d   at   292   (stating,   \"Courts   recognize   two\n\nindependent, but non-exclusive grounds on which the [Board] may\n\ndeny a motion to reopen: (1) failure to establish a prima facie\n\ncase, and (2) failure to introduce previously unavailable, material\n\nevidence.\") (citing Fesseha v. Ashcroft, 333 F.3d 13, 20 (1st Cir.\n\n2003)). Subject to these and other limitations, a motion to reopen\n\nmay be granted if the alien demonstrates that he or she was\n\nstatutorily eligible for such relief prior to the entry of the\n\nadministratively final order of deportation. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c).\n\n          The decision to grant or deny a motion to reopen or\n\nreconsider is within the discretion of the Board, and the Board has\n\ndiscretion to deny a motion to reopen even if the moving party has\n\nmade out a prima facie case for relief.             8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a),\n\nformerly codified in 8 C.F.R. § 3.2(a).              Accordingly, we only\n\noverturn the Board's ruling for an abuse of discretion. Zhang, 348\n\nF.3d at 292.\n\n          Under the abuse of discretion standard, the Board's legal\n\nconclusions are reviewed de novo, according due weight to the\n\nBoard's expertise in construing the statutory framework that it\n\nadministers.5     Radkov v. Ashcroft, No. O2-2666, 2004 U.S. App.\n\n\n     5\n      Velasquez argues we should not defer to the Board's statutory\ninterpretation and, instead, should hold the Board to \"the\nfiduciary standard of responsibility to immigrants -- the highest\nduty recognized under law.\" As Velasquez cites no authority for\n\n                                        -9-\n\fLEXIS 14314, *5 (July 14, 2004).             \"In the immigration context, as\n\nelsewhere, an error of law on the trier's part comprises an abuse\n\nof discretion.\"      Id.\n\n             Here,   Velasquez      argues    the   case   should   be    reopened\n\nbecause he later discovered he had received ineffective assistance\n\nof counsel denying him his rights under both the Sixth Amendment\n\nand the Due Process Clause.            The Board rejected this argument,\n\nfinding that Velasquez had received a full and fair hearing before\n\nan IJ, in which he was given the opportunity to apply for any\n\nrelief for which he was eligible, and because it could find in the\n\nrecord no violations of his rights to due process and no prejudice\n\ncaused by the representation afforded by his counsel.                    The Board\n\ndid not abuse its discretion.\n\n             We   address    only    Velasquez's     due   process    claim;    as\n\n\"[t]here is no Sixth Amendment right to counsel in deportation,\n\nwhich   is   a    civil    proceeding,   but    several    courts    of    appeals\n\n(including this one) have said that where counsel does appear for\n\nthe respondent, incompetence in some situations may make the\n\nproceeding fundamentally unfair and give rise to a Fifth Amendment\n\ndue process objection.\"         Hernandez v. Reno, 238 F.3d 50, 55 (1st\n\nCir. 2001) (citing Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10, 13 (1st Cir. 1988)).\n\nA proceeding is fundamentally unfair when the alien is prevented\n\n\n\n\nthis proposition, we decline to adopt that standard here.\n\n                                       -10-\n\ffrom   reasonably     presenting     his    or    her    case.         Id.\n\n\n\n          At the time Dragon represented him, Dragon was still a\n\nmember of the bar, qualified to act as an attorney.            There is no\n\nevidence in the record relative to the reasons for disbarment or\n\notherwise that could indicate Dragon's peculiar incompetence to act\n\nin Velasquez's case while still licensed (the disbarment was for\n\nmisconduct elsewhere).\n\n          Velasquez provided no specifics to the Board reflecting\n\nincompetence   by   counsel   that   interfered   with   the    reasonable\n\npresentation of his case.     He noted \"problems\" with Dragon that he\n\nsaid compounded a prior bad experience with non-attorney Ansara.\n\nVelasquez accused Dragon of distraction (seemingly ascribed to\n\nDragon's own disbarment proceedings, then in progress), diminished\n\ncommitment, and lack of zealous advocacy, but provided little or\n\nnothing tangible to support these assertions.      Velasquez also adds\n\nthat Dragon's difficulty understanding Spanish handicapped him, but\n\nthis argument would not amount to evidence that \"was not available\n\nand could not have been discovered or presented at the former\n\nhearing\" as is required by 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c).\n\n          Velasquez argues that he is not required to provide\n\nspecific examples of prejudice because the denial of effective\n\nassistance was so clear in the circumstances and the harm --\n\nremoval -- was facially demonstrable.       In doing so, he relies on\n\n                                   -11-\n\four statement in U.S. v. Loasiga, 104 F.3d 484, 488 (1st Cir. 1997)\n\nthat, \"[p]erhaps there may be deportations where a denial of\n\ncounsel was so flagrant, and the difficulty of proving prejudice so\n\ngreat, as to argue for presuming harm.\"      While we have yet to\n\nanswer whether such a situation exists, we need not do so here\n\nbecause Velasquez in fact had counsel and there was no showing that\n\ncounsel did not provide effective assistance. Dragon elicited from\n\nVelasquez testimony germane both to the issue of whether the one-\n\nyear deadline for asylum claims applied and to the merits of\n\nVelasquez's application.   He further provided documents in support\n\nof Velasquez's testimony, including the application materials that\n\nhe had prepared, country reports for Colombia released by the\n\nUnited States Department of State in 1998, 1999, and 2000, releases\n\nfrom Amnesty International, an affidavit from Velasquez, letters\n\nfrom a former employer and from a friend of Velasquez, police\n\nreports, travel documents, and newspaper articles.\n\n          Accordingly, the circumstances pertaining to Dragon and\n\nhis subsequent disbarment provide no reason for us to find that the\n\nBoard abused its discretion in denying the motion to reopen.\n\nII.       Motion to Reconsider\n\n          We turn next to Velasquez's imputed motion to reconsider.\n\n\"A motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for the motion by\n\nspecifying the errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision\n\nand shall be supported by pertinent authority.\"        8 C.F.R. §\n\n                                 -12-\n\f1003.2(b)(1), formerly codified as 8 C.F.R. § 3.2(b)(1). Again, we\n\nreview the Board's determination solely for an abuse of discretion.\n\nZhang, 348 F.3d at 293; Nascimento v. INS, 274 F.3d 26, 28 (1st\n\nCir. 2001). \"In the reconsideration context, we will find an abuse\n\nof   discretion   if   the   denial   was   made   without   a   'rational\n\nexplanation, inexplicably departed from established policies, or\n\nrested on an impermissible basis' (such as race).\" Zhang, 348 F.3d\n\nat 293 (quoting Nascimento, 274 F.3d at 28).\n\n           In his brief to this Court, Velasquez argues that the IJ\n\nerred in three respects: (1) concluding that this case is not\n\nsubject to the extraordinary circumstances exception of 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1158(a)(2)(D) given the delay caused by Ansara; (2) concluding this\n\ncase is not subject to the changed circumstances exception of 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(D)6 given especially State Department documents\n\n\n     6\n      Although not raised by the parties, there is some question as\nto whether this Court has jurisdiction to consider Velasquez's\narguments concerning 8 U.S.C. § 1158.        As mentioned, the IJ\npretermitted Velasquez's asylum application pursuant to section\n1158(a)(2)(B). Section 1158(a)(3) provides that \"[n]o Court shall\nhave jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney\nGeneral under [inter alia, section 1158(a)(2)(B)].\"\n     In Haoud v. Ashcroft, 350 F.3d 201, 205 (1st Cir. 2003) we\ndiscussed the application of section 1158(a)(3) to our review of\na Board decision on direct appeal from an IJ's determination under\nsection 1158(a)(2)(B).      There, we stated \"that 8 U.S.C. §\n1158(a)(3)could bar our review of the IJ's determination of the\ntimeliness of Haoud's asylum application . . . .\"\n     We need and do not decide whether under Haoud we lack\njurisdiction over Velazquez's section 1158 arguments. Velasquez's\narguments concerning the timeliness of his asylum claim are plainly\nwithout merit.     We, therefore, see no need to delve into a\njurisdictional issue neither raised nor briefed by either party.\nSee, e.g., Restoration Pres. Masonry, Inc. v. Grove Eur. Ltd., 325\n\n                                  -13-\n\fsubmitted by Velasquez; (3) and placing the burden on him, rather\n\nthan the government, to prove that internal relocation in Colombia\n\nwould not be reasonable when she considered his asylum claim.7\n\nWhile     the   Board   did   not       individually   address    each   of       these\n\narguments in denying Velasquez's motion, it implicitly resolved\n\nthem, stating, \"[we] . . . note that in our previous decision we\n\naffirmed the Immigration Judge's decision denying the respondents'\n\napplications because they failed to meet their burden to credibly\n\nprove eligibility for the relief they requested.                  We do not find\n\nany basis to disturb our previous decision.\"                  We turn to each of\n\nVelasquez's arguments.\n\n                First, the Board was well within its rights to uphold\n\nthe IJ's conclusion that the extraordinary circumstances exception\n\nto the one-year deadline for asylum applications set forth in 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(D) did not apply here.                  Section 1158(a)(2)(D)\n\nstates in pertinent part, \"[a]n application for asylum of an alien\n\nmay   be   considered     .   .     .    if   the   alien   demonstrates      .    .   .\n\n\n\nF.3d 54, 59 (1st Cir. 2003) (courts may, in appropriate\ncircumstances,   reserve   difficult   questions   of   statutory\njurisdiction when the case could alternatively be resolved on the\nmerits in favor of the same party).\n      7\n      Velasquez also argues that the IJ erred in failing to\nrecognize an \"acquiescence\" argument under the Convention Against\nTorture. He did not raise this argument to the Board, however, so\nit is waived. Cf. Zhang, 348 F.3d at 293 (holding that Board did\nnot abuse discretion by concluding that arguments developed for\nfirst time on reconsideration appeal were waived).\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\fextraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an\n\napplication within the [one-year deadline].\"             Based on Velasquez's\n\ninconsistent     testimony,   the    IJ    concluded      that     the   alleged\n\nextraordinary    circumstances      --   meeting   an    individual      whom   he\n\nmistakenly believed was an attorney and later discovering that the\n\nindividual had disappeared -- began at the earliest in the summer\n\nof 1998, which was after the deadline had expired on April 1, 1998.\n\nThe record evidence supports the IJ's finding.                     The IJ was,\n\ntherefore, correct in concluding that these circumstances did not\n\nconstitute extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in\n\nfiling an application within the one-year deadline.                  8 U.S.C. §\n\n1158(a)(2)(D).\n\n          Second,    the   Board     justifiably        rejected    Velasquez's\n\nargument that the IJ failed to give due weight to the submitted\n\nState   Department   documents      in    determining      that    the   changed\n\ncircumstances exception to the one-year deadline in 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1158(a)(2)(D) did not apply here.          In his brief to us, Velasquez\n\nargues that these documents \"support the premise that Colombia had\n\nchanged politically between 1996 and 1998 into what the Department\n\nhas calculated to be one of the most dangerous places on the\n\nplanet\", and, therefore, the IJ's alleged failure to give weight to\n\nthese documents indicates that she improperly interpreted section\n\n1158(a)(2)(D).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\f             In   addition    to    the     \"extraordinary      circumstances\"\n\nprovision just mentioned, section 1158(a)(2)(D) also provides,\n\n\"[a]n application for asylum may be considered . . . if the alien\n\ndemonstrates . . . the existence of changed circumstances which\n\nmaterially affect the applicant's eligibility for asylum . . . .\"\n\nDuring the hearing, Velasquez argued that his discovery that people\n\nwere   still      looking    for   him    in   1998       constituted    changed\n\ncircumstances under the statute.            He did not refer to the State\n\nDepartment documents as constituting additional or independent\n\ngrounds for concluding that changed circumstances existed.                 These\n\nwere submitted at the beginning of the hearing without articulation\n\nof   their   relevance.       In   response    to   the    argument     that   was\n\narticulated, the IJ stated:\n\n          I find the assertion that someone was still\n          looking for him in 1998 and that is why he did\n          not file for asylum earlier not to constitute\n          changed circumstances.     It appears to be,\n          assuming the truth of it although there's no\n          foundation particularly for it, that this\n          earlier pattern on which he bases his asylum\n          claim had begun back in April of 1995.      So\n          [Velasquez] does not meet the burden on that\n          ground.\nWe find the conclusion to be reasonable. Velasquez testified to\n\nhaving been assaulted by the Populares Milicias in 1995.                 He also\n\ntestified to wanting to stay in the United States indefinitely in\n\nApril of 1996 because of conditions in Colombia.               We see no abuse\n\nof discretion in the IJ's conclusion that Velasquez was, in effect,\n\nfully aware of the basis of his asylum claim well before April 1,\n\n                                     -16-\n\f1998, when the one-year period for seeking asylum          expired.   The IJ\n\nwas entitled to conclude that circumstances already existing and\n\nknown to Velasquez prior to the one-year deadline were not changed\n\nsimply because of word that the Populares Milicias members were\n\nstill   around   and   possibly   inquiring   for   him.      8    U.S.C.   §\n\n1158(a)(2)(D).    As Velasquez's prior beatings and the extortion\n\nearlier practiced put him on notice of the risky conditions in\n\nColombia that particularly concerned him, the State Department\n\ndocuments allegedly indicating an increase in lawlessness generally\n\nadded little.\n\n           Lastly,     as   Velasquez's   asylum    claim    was   properly\n\npretermitted, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B), there is no need to examine\n\nfurther into its possible merits.         Accordingly, we do not review\n\nVelasquez's third argument, which concerns the manner in which the\n\nIJ handled \"in the alternative\" the merits of his asylum claim.             As\n\nVelasquez offers in his brief no cognizable arguments pertaining to\n\neither the withholding of removal or Convention Against Torture\n\nclaims, we proceed no further.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\f",

This is petition for\n\nreview of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"Board\"),\n\nbrought by members of the same family, seeking to overturn orders\n\nfor their removal from the United States to their home country of\n\nColombia.      We affirm the order of the Board.\n\n            As the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\") has\n\ndetermined,     the    \"lead   file\"   is    that    of   Elkin   Edisson   Muriel\n\nVelasquez; the other appellants are all members of his family, and\n\ntheir claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection\n\nunder the Convention Against Torture, rise or fall on the merits of\n\nVelasquez's like claims.          We accordingly focus on the facts and\n\nmerits of Velasquez's case, these being determinative of the\n\nothers' as well.\n\n            Velasquez was most recently admitted to the United States\n\non July 9, 1996 on a nonimmigrant business visa.              His visa expired,\n\nbut he nonetheless remained in this country. On December 22, 1999,\n\nthe INS commenced removal proceedings against him by issuing a\n\nNotice to Appear charging Velasquez with removability pursuant to\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B) as an alien who remained in the United\n\nStates for a time longer than permitted.             On August 18, 1999, James\n\nC.   Dragon,    an    attorney,   prepared     and    filed   with   the    INS   an\n\napplication on behalf of Velasquez for asylum, withholding of\n\nremoval, and protection under the Convention Against Torture.\n\nRepresented by Dragon, Velasquez appeared on March 7, 2000 before\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fan Immigration Judge (\"IJ\"), conceded removability, and entered his\n\nasylum application and supporting documents.    On May 4, 2000, at a\n\nhearing before an IJ, Velasquez testified to the following effect.\n\n            Velasquez owned a store in Itagui, Colombia between 1994\n\nand December of 1996.     During that time, he visited the United\n\nStates on numerous occasions on visitor's visas.     In December of\n\n1995, members of an organization known as Populares Milicias\n\nphysically assaulted him and requested that he pay to them a \"war\n\ntax\" so that he could receive protection from theft or further\n\nviolence. He paid the war tax several times, the payments totaling\n\n8 million pesos.    At one point, he was unable to pay the war tax,\n\nand he thereafter suffered another physical assault and a store\n\nrobbery. He reported the incidents to the police, who installed an\n\ninternal alarm to curb further robberies.   After its installation,\n\nVelasquez suffered no further physical assaults or robberies.\n\nNevertheless, he feared the Populares Milicias and decided in April\n\nof 1996 that he wanted to stay in the United States indefinitely\n\nuntil conditions improved in Colombia.    He returned to the United\n\nStates in    July of 1996 and remained beyond the amount of time\n\npermitted in his visa.   In \"the middle of 1998\" friends and family\n\nmembers called Velasquez stating that people, presumably members of\n\nPopulares Milicias, were asking about his whereabouts. By December\n\nof 1998, he had given up hope of ever returning safely to Colombia,\n\nso he decided to seek information regarding his ability to stay\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\flegally in the United States.    At that time, upon the advice of a\n\nfriend, he met \"Mr. Ansara,\" whom he believed could help him with\n\nhis immigration case.    While Velasquez referred to Ansara as a\n\nlawyer, he conceded that Ansara never told him he was a lawyer.\n\nAfter this initial meeting, Velasquez was able to meet with Ansara\n\nonly one more time before Ansara disappeared.        Four months after\n\ndiscovering Ansara's disappearance, Velasquez retained Dragon as\n\nhis attorney.\n\n          Based on this testimony, Dragon argued to the IJ that\n\nVelasquez's asylum application was not subject to the one-year\n\nfiling deadline set forth in 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B)1 because of\n\nchanged and extraordinary circumstances.   8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(D)\n\n(providing exceptions to one-year filing deadline when petitioner\n\nhas   established   \"changed   circumstances\"   or      \"extraordinary\n\ncircumstances\").    In particular, Velasquez argued that since he\n\nbegan to realize only in the summer of 1998 (when he learned that\n\nmembers of Populares Milicias were still looking for him) that the\n\ncountry conditions in Colombia had changed such that his problems\n\nthere were not going to abate, it was impossible for him to have\n\nfiled an application for asylum by the one-year deadline, which\n\n\n      1\n      Section 1158(a)(1) states, \"[a]ny alien who is physically\npresent in the United States or who arrives in the United States.\n. . may apply for asylum . . . .\" Section 1158(a)(2)(B) states,\nhowever, that \"paragraph (1) shall not apply to an alien unless the\nalien demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the\napplication has been filed within 1 year after the date of the\nalien's arrival in the United States.\"\n\n                                 -4-\n\fexpired   on    April      1,   1998.2      He   further    argued     that   these\n\nconstituted     extraordinary          circumstances,       or      events    beyond\n\nVelasquez's control, that made it impossible for Velasquez to meet\n\nthe filing deadline.            He noted that Velasquez filed his asylum\n\napplication in July of 1999, which he said was shortly after these\n\ndevelopments came to light.\n\n           At the end of the hearing, on May 4, 2000, the IJ issued\n\nher oral decision. She concluded that Velasquez had established no\n\nbasis for her to apply the changed or extraordinary circumstances\n\nexceptions     to    the    one-year     deadline   for    asylum    applications.\n\nAccordingly,        she    pretermitted     Velasquez's     asylum     application\n\npursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B).               The IJ, nevertheless, went\n\non \"in the alternative\" to consider the merits of the asylum claim,\n\ntogether with the withholding of removal and Convention Against\n\nTorture claims, which did not have specific filing deadlines.                    The\n\nIJ commented that, \"[m]uch of the evidence, essentially, is the\n\nsame for all three forms of relief . . . .             [Velasquez] stated that\n\nhe had no additional evidence on the issue of withholding or relief\n\nunder Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture.\"\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      The basis for the IJ's conclusion that the one-year deadline\nexpired on April 1, 1998 does not appear in the record, nor is it\nexplained in the briefs.     Possibly the arrival dates of other\nfamily members are relevant.         The parties, including the\ngovernment, do not dispute that the deadline expired on that date,\nhence we accept it as controlling.\n\n                                          -5-\n\f          The   IJ   rejected   Velasquez's   contention   that   he   was\n\npersecuted for his membership in a particular social group or for\n\nhis political opinion, requirements set out in the INS's relevant\n\nregulation, 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(a).       Threats and   injuries at the\n\nhands of the Populares Milicias were not, in her view, shown to\n\nhave been on account of his political opinion.        Nor did she find\n\nthat Velasquez had shown he belonged to a particular \"social group\"\n\n-- at most, he was a member of the merchant class, which was not\n\nenough.\n\n          Most importantly, the IJ questioned the consistency of\n\nVelasquez's testimony.      She wondered whether he truly feared\n\nPopulares Milicias in light of his willingness to repeatedly return\n\nto Colombia even after he was forced to pay the war tax.          In any\n\nevent, having been both assaulted and threatened as early as in\n\n1995, he was well aware of that group's threat several years prior\n\nto the expiration of the time for his seeking asylum.       She further\n\nstated:\n\n          As to [Velasquez's] credibility, I find that\n          he may be telling the truth about these\n          various assaults; he does have some police\n          reports in corroboration.     The respondent,\n          however, I believe is not credible when he\n          makes wild speculations such as the people, in\n          fact, who had extorted from him. There's no\n          foundation for that . . . In general, I do not\n          find the respondent to be particularly\n          credible.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fIn the IJ's opinion, Velasquez and his family relocated to the\n\nUnited States, not out of fear, but because it provided better\n\n\"prospects.\"\n\n           The IJ concluded that Velasquez was not eligible for\n\nasylum, withholding of removal, or relief under the Convention\n\nAgainst Torture.       She denied Velasquez's application and ordered\n\nhis removal to Colombia.      Velasquez timely appealed to the Board.\n\nOn November 19, 2002, the Board affirmed the IJ's order without\n\nopinion.   Velasquez did not petition this Court for review of the\n\nBoard's affirmance.      8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(1).       However, on December\n\n17, 2002, Velasquez timely filed with the Board a motion styled as\n\none to reopen.3        Velasquez argued that         his discovery from a\n\nNovember 25, 2002 letter that attorney Dragon had been disbarred on\n\nAugust   23,   20024   constituted   a     \"new   fact\"   under   8   C.F.R.   §\n\n\n     3\n      While the motion was styled as a \"Motion to Reopen,\"      it\nappears also to have been a motion for reconsideration as, in\naddition to having raised new facts that would allegedly merit\nreopening, it contained arguments that the Board erred as a matter\nof fact or law.     8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c) (\"A motion to reopen\nproceedings shall state the new facts that will be proven at a\nhearing to be held if the motion is granted and shall be supported\nby affidavits or other evidentiary material.\"); Zhang v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200720\"><a href=\"/opinion/200720/zhang-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">348</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">289</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 293 (1st Cir. 2003) (\"The purpose of a motion to\nreconsider is not to raise new facts, but to demonstrate that the\n[Board] erred as a matter of law or fact.\"). The Board, itself,\ninterpreted the motion as a motion to \"reopen and reconsider.\" In\nkeeping with the Board's reading of Velasquez's motion, we shall\ntreat it as if it were two motions -- a motion to reopen and a\nmotion to reconsider.\n     4\n      It does not appear, and Velasquez does not contend, that\nDragon acted as Velasquez's attorney after having been disbarred.\nDragon was disbarred on August 23, 2002 -- between the filing of\n\n                                     -7-\n\f103.4(a)(2) meriting reopening.       He further argued that the IJ\n\nerred as a matter of law in denying the asylum and related\n\napplications.   On April 17, 2003, the Board denied the motion, and\n\nVelasquez timely petitioned for review by this Court.    8 U.S.C. §\n\n1252(b).\n\nI.         Motion to Reopen\n\n           We first review the Board's denial of Velasquez's motion\n\nto reopen.\n\n           A motion to reopen proceedings shall not be\n           granted unless it appears to the Board that\n           evidence sought to be offered is material and\n           was not available and could not have been\n           discovered or presented at the former hearing;\n           nor shall any motion to reopen for the purpose\n           of affording the alien an opportunity to apply\n           for any form of discretionary relief be\n           granted if it appears that the alien's right\n           to apply for such relief was fully explained\n           to him or her and an opportunity to apply\n           therefore was afforded at the former hearing,\n           unless the relief is sought on the basis of\n           circumstances that have arisen subsequent to\n           the hearing.\n\n\n\n\nVelasquez's initial appeal from the IJ's order to the Board in June\nof 2000 and the issuance of the Board's affirmance of that order on\nNovember 19, 2002. On November 25, 2002, less than a week after\nthe Board's ruling, Velasquez received the letter informing him of\nDragon's disbarment. Velasquez immediately retained Walter Gleason\nas his new attorney. Gleason then filed the motion to reopen and\nreconsider addressed to the Board.\n     Velasquez does not argue that Dragon is to blame for his\nfailure to file a petition for review of the Board's November 19,\n2002 order. Indeed, it appears that he had retained Gleason prior\nto the expiration date to file such a petition.         8 U.S.C. §\n1252(b)(1)(generally allowing 30 days after date of order of\nremoval for filing of petition for review of order).\n\n                                -8-\n\f8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c), formerly codified in 8 C.F.R. § 3.2(c); see\n\nalso Zhang,     348   F.3d   at   292   (stating,   \"Courts   recognize   two\n\nindependent, but non-exclusive grounds on which the [Board] may\n\ndeny a motion to reopen: (1) failure to establish a prima facie\n\ncase, and (2) failure to introduce previously unavailable, material\n\nevidence.\") (citing Fesseha v.

Subject to these and other limitations, a motion to reopen\n\nmay be granted if the alien demonstrates that he or she was\n\nstatutorily eligible for such relief prior to the entry of the\n\nadministratively final order of deportation. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c).\n\n          The decision to grant or deny a motion to reopen or\n\nreconsider is within the discretion of the Board, and the Board has\n\ndiscretion to deny a motion to reopen even if the moving party has\n\nmade out a prima facie case for relief.             8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a),\n\nformerly codified in 8 C.F.R. § 3.2(a).              Accordingly, we only\n\noverturn the Board's ruling for an abuse of discretion. Zhang, 348\n\nF.3d at 292.\n\n          Under the abuse of discretion standard, the Board's legal\n\nconclusions are reviewed de novo, according due weight to the\n\nBoard's expertise in construing the statutory framework that it\n\nadministers.5     Radkov v. Ashcroft, No. O2-2666, 2004 U.S. App.\n\n\n     5\n      Velasquez argues we should not defer to the Board's statutory\ninterpretation and, instead, should hold the Board to \"the\nfiduciary standard of responsibility to immigrants -- the highest\nduty recognized under law.\" As Velasquez cites no authority for\n\n                                        -9-\n\fLEXIS 14314, *5 (July 14, 2004).             \"In the immigration context, as\n\nelsewhere, an error of law on the trier's part comprises an abuse\n\nof discretion.\"      Id.\n\n             Here,   Velasquez      argues    the   case   should   be    reopened\n\nbecause he later discovered he had received ineffective assistance\n\nof counsel denying him his rights under both the Sixth Amendment\n\nand the Due Process Clause.            The Board rejected this argument,\n\nfinding that Velasquez had received a full and fair hearing before\n\nan IJ, in which he was given the opportunity to apply for any\n\nrelief for which he was eligible, and because it could find in the\n\nrecord no violations of his rights to due process and no prejudice\n\ncaused by the representation afforded by his counsel.                    The Board\n\ndid not abuse its discretion.\n\n             We   address    only    Velasquez's     due   process    claim;    as\n\n\"[t]here is no Sixth Amendment right to counsel in deportation,\n\nwhich   is   a    civil    proceeding,   but    several    courts    of    appeals\n\n(including this one) have said that where counsel does appear for\n\nthe respondent, incompetence in some situations may make the\n\nproceeding fundamentally unfair and give rise to a Fifth Amendment\n\ndue process objection.\"         Hernandez v.

There is no\n\nevidence in the record relative to the reasons for disbarment or\n\notherwise that could indicate Dragon's peculiar incompetence to act\n\nin Velasquez's case while still licensed (the disbarment was for\n\nmisconduct elsewhere).\n\n          Velasquez provided no specifics to the Board reflecting\n\nincompetence   by   counsel   that   interfered   with   the    reasonable\n\npresentation of his case.     He noted \"problems\" with Dragon that he\n\nsaid compounded a prior bad experience with non-attorney Ansara.\n\nVelasquez accused Dragon of distraction (seemingly ascribed to\n\nDragon's own disbarment proceedings, then in progress), diminished\n\ncommitment, and lack of zealous advocacy, but provided little or\n\nnothing tangible to support these assertions.      Velasquez also adds\n\nthat Dragon's difficulty understanding Spanish handicapped him, but\n\nthis argument would not amount to evidence that \"was not available\n\nand could not have been discovered or presented at the former\n\nhearing\" as is required by 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c).\n\n          Velasquez argues that he is not required to provide\n\nspecific examples of prejudice because the denial of effective\n\nassistance was so clear in the circumstances and the harm --\n\nremoval -- was facially demonstrable.       In doing so, he relies on\n\n                                   -11-\n\four statement in U.S. v.

Dragon elicited from\n\nVelasquez testimony germane both to the issue of whether the one-\n\nyear deadline for asylum claims applied and to the merits of\n\nVelasquez's application.   He further provided documents in support\n\nof Velasquez's testimony, including the application materials that\n\nhe had prepared, country reports for Colombia released by the\n\nUnited States Department of State in 1998, 1999, and 2000, releases\n\nfrom Amnesty International, an affidavit from Velasquez, letters\n\nfrom a former employer and from a friend of Velasquez, police\n\nreports, travel documents, and newspaper articles.\n\n          Accordingly, the circumstances pertaining to Dragon and\n\nhis subsequent disbarment provide no reason for us to find that the\n\nBoard abused its discretion in denying the motion to reopen.\n\nII.

As mentioned, the IJ\npretermitted Velasquez's asylum application pursuant to section\n1158(a)(2)(B). Section 1158(a)(3) provides that \"[n]o Court shall\nhave jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney\nGeneral under [inter alia, section 1158(a)(2)(B)].\"\n     In Haoud v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200742\"><a href=\"/opinion/200742/haoud-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">350</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">201</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 205 (1st Cir. 2003) we\ndiscussed the application of section 1158(a)(3) to our review of\na Board decision on direct appeal from an IJ's determination under\nsection 1158(a)(2)(B).      There, we stated \"that 8 U.S.C. §\n1158(a)(3)could bar our review of the IJ's determination of the\ntimeliness of Haoud's asylum application . . . .\"\n     We need and do not decide whether under Haoud we lack\njurisdiction over Velazquez's section 1158 arguments. Velasquez's\narguments concerning the timeliness of his asylum claim are plainly\nwithout merit.     We, therefore, see no need to delve into a\njurisdictional issue neither raised nor briefed by either party.\nSee, e.g., Restoration Pres. Masonry, Inc. v. Grove Eur. Ltd., 325\n\n                                  -13-\n\fsubmitted by Velasquez; (3) and placing the burden on him, rather\n\nthan the government, to prove that internal relocation in Colombia\n\nwould not be reasonable when she considered his asylum claim.7\n\nWhile     the   Board   did   not       individually   address    each   of       these\n\narguments in denying Velasquez's motion, it implicitly resolved\n\nthem, stating, \"[we] . . . note that in our previous decision we\n\naffirmed the Immigration Judge's decision denying the respondents'\n\napplications because they failed to meet their burden to credibly\n\nprove eligibility for the relief they requested.                  We do not find\n\nany basis to disturb our previous decision.\"                  We turn to each of\n\nVelasquez's arguments.\n\n                First, the Board was well within its rights to uphold\n\nthe IJ's conclusion that the extraordinary circumstances exception\n\nto the one-year deadline for asylum applications set forth in 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(D) did not apply here.                  Section 1158(a)(2)(D)\n\nstates in pertinent part, \"[a]n application for asylum of an alien\n\nmay   be   considered     .   .     .    if   the   alien   demonstrates      .    .   .\n\n\n\nF.3d 54, 59 (1st Cir. 2003) (courts may, in appropriate\ncircumstances,   reserve   difficult   questions   of   statutory\njurisdiction when the case could alternatively be resolved on the\nmerits in favor of the same party).\n      7\n      Velasquez also argues that the IJ erred in failing to\nrecognize an \"acquiescence\" argument under the Convention Against\nTorture. He did not raise this argument to the Board, however, so\nit is waived. Cf. Zhang, 348 F.3d at 293 (holding that Board did\nnot abuse discretion by concluding that arguments developed for\nfirst time on reconsideration appeal were waived).\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\fextraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an\n\napplication within the [one-year deadline].\"             Based on Velasquez's\n\ninconsistent     testimony,   the    IJ    concluded      that     the   alleged\n\nextraordinary    circumstances      --   meeting   an    individual      whom   he\n\nmistakenly believed was an attorney and later discovering that the\n\nindividual had disappeared -- began at the earliest in the summer\n\nof 1998, which was after the deadline had expired on April 1, 1998.\n\nThe record evidence supports the IJ's finding.                     The IJ was,\n\ntherefore, correct in concluding that these circumstances did not\n\nconstitute extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in\n\nfiling an application within the one-year deadline.                  8 U.S.C. §\n\n1158(a)(2)(D).\n\n          Second,    the   Board     justifiably        rejected    Velasquez's\n\nargument that the IJ failed to give due weight to the submitted\n\nState   Department   documents      in    determining      that    the   changed\n\ncircumstances exception to the one-year deadline in 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1158(a)(2)(D) did not apply here.          In his brief to us, Velasquez\n\nargues that these documents \"support the premise that Colombia had\n\nchanged politically between 1996 and 1998 into what the Department\n\nhas calculated to be one of the most dangerous places on the\n\nplanet\", and, therefore, the IJ's alleged failure to give weight to\n\nthese documents indicates that she improperly interpreted section\n\n1158(a)(2)(D).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\f             In   addition    to    the     \"extraordinary      circumstances\"\n\nprovision just mentioned, section 1158(a)(2)(D) also provides,\n\n\"[a]n application for asylum may be considered . . . if the alien\n\ndemonstrates . . . the existence of changed circumstances which\n\nmaterially affect the applicant's eligibility for asylum . . . .\"\n\nDuring the hearing, Velasquez argued that his discovery that people\n\nwere   still      looking    for   him    in   1998       constituted    changed\n\ncircumstances under the statute.            He did not refer to the State\n\nDepartment documents as constituting additional or independent\n\ngrounds for concluding that changed circumstances existed.                 These\n\nwere submitted at the beginning of the hearing without articulation\n\nof   their   relevance.       In   response    to   the    argument     that   was\n\narticulated, the IJ stated:\n\n          I find the assertion that someone was still\n          looking for him in 1998 and that is why he did\n          not file for asylum earlier not to constitute\n          changed circumstances.     It appears to be,\n          assuming the truth of it although there's no\n          foundation particularly for it, that this\n          earlier pattern on which he bases his asylum\n          claim had begun back in April of 1995.      So\n          [Velasquez] does not meet the burden on that\n          ground.\nWe find the conclusion to be reasonable. Velasquez testified to\n\nhaving been assaulted by the Populares Milicias in 1995.                 He also\n\ntestified to wanting to stay in the United States indefinitely in\n\nApril of 1996 because of conditions in Colombia.               We see no abuse\n\nof discretion in the IJ's conclusion that Velasquez was, in effect,\n\nfully aware of the basis of his asylum claim well before April 1,\n\n                                     -16-\n\f1998, when the one-year period for seeking asylum          expired.   The IJ\n\nwas entitled to conclude that circumstances already existing and\n\nknown to Velasquez prior to the one-year deadline were not changed\n\nsimply because of word that the Populares Milicias members were\n\nstill   around   and   possibly   inquiring   for   him.      8    U.S.C.   §\n\n1158(a)(2)(D).    As Velasquez's prior beatings and the extortion\n\nearlier practiced put him on notice of the risky conditions in\n\nColombia that particularly concerned him, the State Department\n\ndocuments allegedly indicating an increase in lawlessness generally\n\nadded little.\n\n           Lastly,     as   Velasquez's   asylum    claim    was   properly\n\npretermitted, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B), there is no need to examine\n\nfurther into its possible merits.         Accordingly, we do not review\n\nVelasquez's third argument, which concerns the manner in which the\n\nIJ handled \"in the alternative\" the merits of his asylum claim.             As\n\nVelasquez offers in his brief no cognizable arguments pertaining to\n\neither the withholding of removal or Convention Against Torture\n\nclaims, we proceed no further.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\f</pre>",
