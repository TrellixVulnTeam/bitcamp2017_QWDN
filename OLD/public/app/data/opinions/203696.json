Daniel R. Domínguez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                    Boudin, Lipez and Howard,\n\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Hector L. Ramos-Vega, Assistant Federal Public Defender, with\nwhom Joseph C. Laws, Jr., Federal Public Defender, Patricia A.\nGarrity, Assistant Federal Public Defender, and Vivianne M.\nMarrero, Research and Writing Specialist, were on brief for\nappellant.\n     Luke Cass, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom Rosa\nEmilia Rodriguez-Velez, United States Attorney, and Nelson Pérez-\nSosa, Assistant United States Attorney, Chief, Appellate Division,\nwere on brief for appellee.\n\n\n                        February 25, 2009\n\f              Per Curiam.   On November 9, 1998, Jesus Perez-Cruz pled\n\nguilty   to    conspiracy   to   distribute     more   than   5   kilograms   of\n\ncocaine, more than 5 kilograms of cocaine base, and more than 100\n\nkilograms of marijuana, 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 846 (2006). He had\n\nalso been indicted for conducting a continuing criminal enterprise\n\ninvolving drug trafficking which (given the quantities) pointed\n\ntoward a mandatory life sentence, id. § 848(b), but as part of the\n\nplea arrangement the government dropped this count.\n\n              Perez-Cruz    headed   a      substantial   drug      trafficking\n\nenterprise at a public housing project in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico,\n\nwhich distributed cocaine, crack and marijuana.                   The gang used\n\nviolence to maintain its position, including murder.                   The pre-\n\nsentence      report   initially     assigned     to   Perez-Cruz      specific\n\nresponsibility for two separate murders and Perez-Cruz conceded\n\ninvolvement in at least one.\n\n              Under the applicable sentencing guidelines as described\n\nin the pre-sentence report (seemingly the 1999 edition), the drug\n\nquantity should not have mattered because the murder required a\n\nbase offense level of 43,        U.S.S.G. § 2A1.1, which was adjusted by\n\nthe report (up 2 levels for leadership, id. § 3B1.1(c), and down 3\n\nfor acceptance of responsibility, id. § 3E1.1) and pointed to a\n\nguideline range of 360 months to life.                 Id. Sentencing Table\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f(1998).1   Given his plea to the indictment, a life sentence was the\n\npermissible maximum.\n\n           However, by the plea agreement, the government agreed\n\nthat Perez-Cruz should be held responsible for far lower drug\n\nquantities than were specified in the indictment.       The   lower\n\nquantities in the agreement pointed to a base offense level of 38,\n\nand an adjusted level of 39 (ignoring any murder but including\n\nupward adjustments for leadership and firearms (see note 1), and a\n\ndownward adjustment for accepting responsibility).   The government\n\nalso agreed that Perez-Cruz's criminal history should be Level II,\n\nalthough the probation report calculated it as Level III.\n\n           With the adjustments agreed to by the government, the\n\nresulting range was 292 to 365 months, and the plea agreement\n\nrecommended on behalf of both Perez-Cruz and the government a\n\nsentence of 324 months. Neither the bargained-for calculations nor\n\nthe recommendations bound the district court; but, treating the\n\nsentence as an agreed-to guideline departure--this was a pre-Booker\n\nsentence--the district judge acquiesced and sentenced Perez-Cruz to\n\n324 months.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      In the plea agreement, Perez-Cruz stipulated to a further\nupward adjustment of 2 levels based on the possession of firearms\nin connection with the offense, U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(1).         For\nreasons that are not clear, the probation officer did not make this\nadjustment in his own calculation; if it were applied, the\nguideline sentence would have been life.\n\n                                 -3-\n\f            Nine years later, Perez-Cruz filed a pro se motion for\n\nreduction of sentence based on guideline amendments adjusting\n\ndownward the crack cocaine guidelines.2    The Commission made the\n\namendments applicable to already final sentences, a step that\n\nallows an inmate to request a re-computation of his sentence if it\n\nwas based on an offense level that has subsequently been adjusted\n\ndownward.    Under the governing statute, 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2)\n\n(2006), the district judge is then free, although not obliged, to\n\nre-compute the sentence on motion by the inmate.\n\n            The district court denied the motion in this instance,\n\nstating that the motion relied on amendments 706 and 711, which by\n\ntheir terms did not apply where (as here) the offense involved\n\nmultiple drug types rather than just crack cocaine alone.   Perez-\n\nCruz, now counseled by the Federal Public Defender, appeals from\n\nthis decision.   His brief argues that amendment 715, adopted after\n\nPerez-Cruz's motion but while it was pending, applies the crack\n\nreductions to cases involving multiple drugs.\n\n            The government's opposing brief in this court offers 20\n\npages of objections.    They include the fact that the plea was a\n\nnegotiated one, that the plea agreement dropped an even more\n\n\n\n     2\n      Bowing to widespread criticism of the 100 to 1 crack to\ncocaine ratio, the Commission modestly reduced the offense levels\nprescribed for crack at various quantity levels, starting with two\namendments (706 and 711), promulgated November 1, 2007, and with a\nlater amendment (715), promulgated May 1, 2008, extending the\nreduction to cases where multiple drug types were involved.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fserious count and made a joint recommendation well below what\n\nPerez-Cruz would likely have faced if convicted even on the counts\n\nto which he pled, that his plea agreement included an unqualified\n\nwaiver of any right to appeal the sentence (ignored by his opening\n\nbrief in this court) and that he never invoked amendment 715 below\n\nand so forfeited the claim.\n\n               Putting to one side the other objections, the final one--\n\nforfeiture--is self-evident; but a forfeiture can be disregarded\n\nunder       plain error doctrine, assuming the necessary showings of\n\nerror, plainness, prejudice and a miscarriage of justice.                 United\n\nStates v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725 (1993).            Perez-Cruz was un-counseled\n\nin the district court and we might be disposed to ignore the\n\nforfeiture--and reach the government's other objections--if any\n\nreal       chance   existed   that   the    district   court   might   lower   the\n\nsentence.\n\n               The government agrees that if one assumed as accurate the\n\ndrug quantities stipulated as part of the plea bargain and adjusted\n\nthem in accordance with amendment 715, the guideline range would be\n\nsomewhat lower than the actual sentence.               Yet that would be true\n\nonly if one ignored the admission of at least one murder.3               Indeed,\n\n\n       3\n      One might also have to ignore other deviations from the PSR's\nmuch higher recommended guidelines range--deviations that the\ngovernment was willing to make only because of the plea bargain.\nApart from the murder, the prospect of a reduced guideline range\nappears to depend--aside from the reduction based on the newly\nprescribed crack guideline--on reducing the criminal history\ncategory from III to II and ignoring the firearms adjustment.\n\n                                           -5-\n\fif the plea agreement's specification that Perez-Cruz intended to\n\ndistribute in excess of 5 kilograms of cocaine base is taken as\n\ntrue, amendment 715 would not apply at all.4\n\n                  In other words, even if the government's other legal\n\nobjections could be overcome, the likelihood seems vanishingly\n\nsmall that the district judge would in the end be presented with a\n\nlower        guideline   range    and   then,    in   addition,    exercise   his\n\ndiscretion to reduce the sentence below the bargained level that\n\nPerez-Cruz achieved at the outset.              Nothing in the Federal Public\n\nDefender's brief even begins to confront this difficulty: it simply\n\ntakes the bargained for calculations as a starting point from which\n\namendment 715 would prescribe a further reduction.\n\n                  Even if the plea bargain or waiver of appeal do not\n\npreclude a recalculation of the sentence, it is hard to imagine\n\nthat        the   district   judge   would   start    in   re-sentencing   with   a\n\nbaseline that was seemingly inaccurate and was accepted by the\n\ndistrict judge only as part of a bargain that the defendant now\n\nseeks to disavow.             The district judge approved the resulting\n\nsentence as reasonable in light of the bargain and, far from\n\napproving the calculations, described the sentence as a departure.\n\n\n\n\n        4\n      See U.S.S.G. § 2d1.1 Application Note 10(D)(ii) (\"The 2-level\nreduction provided in subdivision (i) shall not apply in a case in\nwhich: (I) the offense involved 4.5 kg or more, or less than 250\nmg, of cocaine base . . . .\").\n\n                                         -6-\n\f          The government's objections, apart from forfeiture, raise\n\nissues which are far-reaching and which might or might not yield a\n\nsimple rule applicable in all cases.   It is neither necessary nor\n\nwise to pursue them in a case where forfeiture, albeit technical,\n\nis patent and the prospect of a different outcome seems wholly\n\nimplausible.

Yet that would be true only if one ignored the admission of at least one murder.<sup>[3]</sup> Indeed, if the plea agreement's specification that Perez-Cruz intended to distribute in excess of 5 kilograms of cocaine base is taken as true, amendment 715 would not apply at all.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>In other words, even if the government's other legal objections could be overcome, the likelihood seems vanishingly small that the district judge would in the end be presented with a lower guideline range and then, <i>in addition,</i> exercise his discretion to reduce the sentence below the bargained level that Perez-Cruz achieved at the outset. Nothing in the Federal Public Defender's brief even begins to confront this difficulty: it simply takes the bargained for calculations as a starting point from which amendment 715 would prescribe a further reduction.</p>\n<p>Even if the plea bargain or waiver of appeal do not preclude a recalculation of the sentence, it is hard to imagine that the district judge would <i>start</i> in re-sentencing with a baseline that was seemingly inaccurate and was accepted by the district judge only as part of a bargain that the defendant now seeks to disavow. The district judge approved the resulting <i>sentence</i> as reasonable in light of the bargain and, far from approving the calculations, described the sentence as a departure.</p>\n<p>The government's objections, apart from forfeiture, raise issues which are far-reaching and which might or might not yield a simple rule applicable in all cases. It is neither necessary nor wise to pursue them in a case where forfeiture, albeit technical, is patent and the prospect of a different outcome seems wholly implausible. There is nothing close to the showing of prejudice ordinarily needed to find plain error under <i>Olano.</i></p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  In the plea agreement, Perez-Cruz stipulated to a further upward adjustment of 2 levels based on the possession of firearms in connection with the offense, U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(1). For reasons that are not clear, the probation officer did not make this adjustment in his own calculation; if it were applied, the guideline sentence would have been life.</p>\n<p>[2]  Bowing to widespread criticism of the 100 to 1 crack to cocaine ratio, the Commission modestly reduced the offense levels prescribed for crack at various quantity levels, starting with two amendments (706 and 711), promulgated November 1, 2007, and with a later amendment (715), promulgated May 1, 2008, extending the reduction to cases where multiple drug types were involved.</p>\n<p>[3]  One might also have to ignore other deviations from the PSR's much higher recommended guidelines rangedeviations that the government was willing to make only because of the plea bargain. Apart from the murder, the prospect of a reduced guideline range appears to dependaside from the reduction based on the newly prescribed crack guidelineon reducing the criminal history category from III to II and ignoring the firearms adjustment.</p>\n<p>[4]  <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. § 2d1.1 Application Note 10(D)(ii) (\"The 2-level reduction provided in subdivision (i) shall not apply in a case in which: (I) the offense involved 4.5 kg or more, or less than 250 mg, of cocaine base. ...\").</p>\n\n</div>",
