Sowa was on brief for appellant.\nMarc DeSisto was on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                July 28, 2004\n\f             ROSENN, Senior Circuit Judge. This appeal presents an\n\nimportant, although not infrequent, question arising out of the\n\ndelicate relationship between a teacher and student in the public\n\nschool    system.     The   question    is:   how    deep   must    a    police\n\ninvestigation extend before there is sufficient probable cause for\n\nthe arrest of a school teacher accused of sexually molesting a\n\nstudent?     At stake is the professional career and reputation of a\n\nhigh school teacher on one hand, and on the other the safety,\n\nhealth, and moral values of the student.            Caught between the two\n\nare the police officers called to investigate and, if warranted, to\n\narrest for prosecution.\n\n             A fifteen-year-old male student complained to his high\n\nschool principal that his special education teacher had sexually\n\nmolested him while in class. The complaint led to an investigation\n\nand the arrest of the teacher by the Pawtucket, Rhode Island,\n\nPolice Department.     The charge against the teacher, Richard Forest\n\n(“Forest”), a Massachusetts resident, was ultimately dismissed by\n\nthe state court.      Forest thereupon brought a civil suit under 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983 in the United States District Court for the District\n\nof   Rhode   Island   against   the    City   of    Pawtucket,     the   Police\n\nDepartment, and individual officers, claiming a violation of his\n\nFourth Amendment rights under the Federal Constitution.1                    The\n\n\n      1\n       The pertinent language of the Fourth Amendment provides:\n“The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fDistrict Court found that the police officers had reasonable\n\nprobable cause to arrest Forest and granted summary judgment in\n\ntheir favor.    Forest timely appealed.    We affirm.\n\n                                  I.\n\n            Forest had been employed by the Pawtucket School District\n\nin Rhode Island as a full-time special education teacher at Tolman\n\nHigh School for 30 years.     At the time of the events relevant to\n\nthis case, he taught a “life skills” course for special needs\n\nchildren. Jeffrey Montella (“Montella”), one of his students, left\n\nForest’s classroom on January 24, 2000, and went to the principal’s\n\noffice to report an incident of misconduct.         Montella informed\n\nPrincipal    Rousselle   (“Rousselle”)    that   Forest   touched   him\n\ninappropriately in a sexual manner during class. Montella provided\n\na written statement to Rousselle detailing the incident.\n\n            At approximately 5 p.m. that evening, Montella and his\n\nmother, Gail Montella, went to the Pawtucket Police Department and\n\nfiled a complaint against Forest.        Montella gave Officer Dennis\n\nSmith a written statement alleging that Forest “grabbed and rubbed\n\n[his] penis during class.” Montella also disclosed that Forest had\n\nrubbed his shoulders and legs in the past, in a way that made him\n\nuncomfortable.\n\n            Officer Smith referred the complaint to Detectives Scott\n\nFeeley and William Magill, who reinterviewed Montella and his\n\n\n\npapers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures\nshall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue but upon\nprobable cause, supported by oath or affirmation.”\n\n                                 -4-\n\fmother on that same evening. During the second interview, Montella\n\ndrew a diagram depicting the seating arrangement in the class at\n\nthe time of the alleged incident.            The diagram shows that when the\n\nmisconduct allegedly occurred, there were four other students in\n\nthe classroom, two sitting beside Montella and two sitting across\n\nthe room facing him.       A teaching assistant, Cheryl Ann Lainhart,\n\nwas seated a short distance to the left of the row occupied by\n\nMontella and his two fellow students.\n\n            Gail Montella also provided a written statement to the\n\ndetectives.       She   affirmed      that    her   son    told   her   about     the\n\ninappropriate touching that occurred earlier in the day, and that\n\nher son had complained in the past about Forest rubbing his\n\nshoulders and thigh.        Ms. Montella explained that when her son\n\noriginally    complained       of   inappropriate       touching,    she    did   not\n\nbelieve it to be significant because she assumed that Forest was\n\nsimply being nice to her son.                She also assumed that Forest’s\n\nattention to Montella was not out of the ordinary, as Forest had\n\nbeen generous with the Montella family in the past, giving them a\n\nlarge bag of gifts at Christmas and a $50 gift certificate to a\n\ngrocery store.     Ms. Montella explained in her statement that she\n\nbelieved her son’s story about the alleged misconduct in the\n\nclassroom because Forest had always been nice to her family, and\n\ntherefore her son had no reason to lie in order to harm him.\n\n             Detectives    Feeley     and     Magill      interviewed      Principal\n\nRousselle    on   the   same    evening      of   the   complaint.         Rousselle\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fconfirmed that Montella had come to his office during class that\n\nday, made an oral complaint, and provided a written statement\n\nregarding   the   incident.       After   confirming   the   incident   with\n\nRousselle, the detectives called Forest at 8:30 p.m., leaving a\n\nmessage on his answering machine, and again at 9:10 p.m., when they\n\nreached Forest on the phone.        The detectives asked Forest to come\n\nto the police station, but Forest declined because he could not\n\nreach his attorney.    At 10 p.m., after speaking with his attorney,\n\nForest called the detectives and agreed to voluntarily appear at\n\nthe police station.    On January 26, 2000, Forest was arrested and\n\ncharged with second degree sexual assault.\n\n            Detective Feeley prepared the affidavit in support of the\n\narrest warrant on the evening of January 24, after he received the\n\ncomplaint from Montella, verified the incident with Montella’s\n\nmother,   and   confirmed   the   incident   with   Principal   Rousselle.\n\nFeeley did not interview Forest, the teaching assistant, or any\n\nother students present in the classroom at the time of the alleged\n\nincident.   But, Feeley stated that he found Montella’s claim to be\n\ncredible.\n\n            The affidavit in support of the arrest warrant recounted\n\nMontella’s story, explaining that Forest asked Montella about his\n\nnew fleece jacket, and allegedly rubbed Montella’s penis while he\n\nreached upward to feel the jacket material. Feeley did not include\n\nin the affidavit an explanation that Montella was a special needs\n\nstudent taking Ritalin for his Attention Deficit Hyperactivity\n\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fDisorder, nor did he indicate that there were other students in the\n\nclassroom during the alleged incident who may have witnessed the\n\nevent.   Bail Commissioner Ernest Pratt reviewed the affidavit,\n\nfound probable cause to arrest Forest, and signed the warrant.\n\n          The Pawtucket School Department investigated Montella’s\n\nallegation    and   found   that   “[t]here   was   no   credible   evidence\n\npresented that Jeffrey Montella was fondled sexually by Richard\n\nForest in the Life Skills Class.”         Subsequently, the Rhode Island\n\nAttorney General’s office declined to prosecute, and the Rhode\n\nIsland state district court dismissed the case.\n\n             After the charges were dismissed, Forest brought suit\n\nraising eleven counts against multiple defendants.2                 Counts I\n\nthrough VII, which included claims brought under the Fourth and\n\nFifth Amendments plus multiple state law claims, were raised\n\nagainst the city, the police department, and several officers\n\ninvolved (“Pawtucket Defendants”). Counts VIII through XI included\n\nstate law claims raised against Montella and his family members\n\n(“Montella Defendants”).       Only the Pawtucket Defendants filed a\n\nmotion for summary judgment, which was granted by the District\n\nCourt.   Therefore, counts VIII through XI involving the Montella\n\nDefendants were not considered on summary judgment before the\n\n\n\n     2\n       The District Court maintained jurisdiction over the\noriginal federal claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, and over\nthe state law claims pursuant to diversity jurisdiction, 28\nU.S.C. § 1332(a). This court has jurisdiction over an appeal of\nthe District Court’s grant of summary judgment under 28 U.S.C. §\n1291.\n\n                                    -7-\n\fDistrict Court, and are not now before this court on appeal.\n\nFurthermore, Forest only appeals the District Court’s grant of\n\nsummary judgment on Count I involving the alleged violation of his\n\nFourth Amendment rights.      Our review is limited to this single\n\nissue.\n\n                                II.\n\n          Forest’s   Fourth    Amendment   claim   asserts   that   his\n\nconstitutional rights were violated because he was arrested without\n\nprobable cause.   The District Court granted summary judgment on\n\nthis claim based on two separate, but related grounds.       First, the\n\nDistrict Court found that the detectives had probable cause to\n\narrest Forest, and thus there was no constitutional violation. The\n\nPawtucket Defendants were therefore entitled to qualified immunity.\n\nSecond, the Court’s finding of no constitutional violation also\n\njustified summary judgment on the merits of the § 1983 claim.       See\n\nMorales v. Ramirez, 906 F.2d 784, 787 (1st Cir. 1990) (explaining\n\nthat although qualified immunity and the merits of § 1983 suit are\n\nseparate inquiries, a finding of no constitutional violation may\n\nresolve both).\n\n          We review the District Court’s grant of summary judgment\n\nde novo. Grant’s Dairy-Maine LLC v. Comm’r of Maine Dept. of\n\nAgric., Food and Rural Res., 232 F.3d 8, 14 (1st Cir. 2000).        We\n\nreview all evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving\n\nparty, and will affirm if we conclude that there are no issues of\n\nmaterial fact, and the Appellees deserve judgment as a matter of\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\flaw. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Morrissey v. Boston Five Cents Savings\n\nBank, 54 F.3d 27, 31 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n                                    III.\n\n            Qualified immunity is not a defense on the merits, but is\n\n“an entitlement not to stand trial or face the other burdens of\n\nlitigation.”    Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 200 (2001) (citation\n\nomitted).     Consequently, it is important to resolve the immunity\n\nquestion as early as possible in the litigation.                  Id. at 201.\n\nGovernment officials will not be entitled to qualified immunity if\n\ntheir conduct violated a statutory or constitutional right that is\n\n“clearly established.” Id. Thus, the first threshold inquiry must\n\nbe whether the facts, taken in the light most favorable to the\n\nparty claiming injury, show that an officer’s conduct violated a\n\nstatutory or constitutional right. If the facts do not support the\n\nviolation of a right, then the inquiry ends at that point, and the\n\ncourt does not proceed to the second question of whether the right\n\nallegedly violated was clearly established.           Id.\n\n            Probable cause analysis requires inquiry into the facts\n\nand circumstances within the arresting officer’s knowledge at the\n\ntime of arrest to determine if a person of “reasonable caution and\n\nprudence” would have believed that the defendant committed a crime.\n\nFloyd v. Farrell, 765 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1985).                  It does not\n\nrequire   evidence     to   prove   guilt   beyond    a    reasonable    doubt.\n\n“[P]robable    cause   need   not   be   tantamount       to   proof   beyond   a\n\nreasonable doubt . . . . Probability is the touchstone.”                U.S. v.\n\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fGrant, 218 F.3d 72, 75 (1st Cir. 2000) (citation omitted).                          “The\n\nprobable cause standard does not require the officers’ conclusion\n\nto be ironclad, or even highly probable.                        Their conclusion that\n\nprobable       cause    exists     need       only    be   reasonable.”       U.S.    v.\n\nWinchenbach, 197 F.3d 548, 555-56 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n               This     court    has    affirmed       that     police   officers     can\n\njustifiably rely upon the credible complaint by a victim to support\n\na finding of probable cause.                     B.C.R. Transport Co., Inc. v.\n\nFontaine, 727 F.2d 7, 10 (1st Cir. 1984) (noting that although not\n\na   per   se   rule,     a   probable     cause       determination      predicated   on\n\ninformation      furnished       by     the    victim      is   generally   considered\n\nreliable).      Therefore, the primary inquiry in this case is whether\n\nthere is any evidence that the officers acted unreasonably when\n\nthey determined that Montella’s accusation was credible, in light\n\nof all the circumstances known at the time.\n\n               Forest     argues       that     the    accusation     was   inherently\n\nunreliable because Montella alleged that the incident occurred in\n\nfront of an entire classroom of students and a teaching aide, none\n\nof whom were interviewed prior to the arrest.                      However, the facts\n\nknown to the detectives at the time of arrest do not support this\n\nconclusion.       Montella did not claim that Forest molested him in\n\nclear view of an entire classroom of students.                       According to the\n\ndiagram provided by Montella, there were only four other students\n\nand a teaching assistant in the class at the time of the incident,\n\nand only two of the other students were facing Montella.                              The\n\n\n\n                                              -10-\n\fothers in the room were situated to Montella’s side where they\n\nwould not necessarily have had a clear view.            Also, Montella\n\nexplained that Forest was commenting on, and touching Montella’s\n\njacket when the alleged molestation occurred.        Therefore, it was\n\nreasonable for the detectives to conclude that even an eye witness\n\nwould not necessarily have recognized any inappropriate touching.\n\n          Forest also argues that because Montella was a special\n\nneeds student, his credibility should have been questioned.           But\n\nthere is no evidence that Montella’s condition of Attention Deficit\n\nand Hyperactivity Disorder, and his prescription of Ritalin, had\n\nany effect on his credibility.     Rather, Detective Feeley believed\n\nthat Montella was not mentally incapacitated in any relevant\n\nmanner, and made an independent determination that Montella was\n\n“fairly intelligent and credible.”\n\n          Finally, Forest argues that under Bevier v. Hucal, 806\n\nF.2d 123 (7th Cir. 1986), the officers were required to interview\n\nreadily available witnesses before seeking an arrest warrant.\n\nHowever, Bevier does not support Forest’s argument. In Bevier, the\n\npolice arrested two parents for child abuse with absolutely no\n\ninvestigation   or   evidence   supporting   the   abuse,   even   though\n\nwitnesses who could have been consulted were readily available.\n\nId. at 128.   In this case, the police did conduct an investigation.\n\nThe detectives interviewed Montella twice to ascertain his primary\n\naccusation, interviewed his mother to verify the account and learn\n\nthat Montella had complained in the past of inappropriate touching,\n\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fand confirmed the events with Principal Rousselle.         All of the\n\ninformation gleaned from these interviews and statements provided\n\nreasonable evidence to support probable cause.\n\n          Forest asserts that the officers should have interviewed\n\nthe other students in the classroom and the teaching assistant\n\nbefore seeking the arrest warrant.      However, the law is clear that\n\nonce police officers are presented with probable cause to support\n\nan arrest, no further investigation is required at that point.\n\nSee, e.g., Brodnicki v. City of Omaha, 75 f.3d 1261, 1264 (8th Cir.\n\n1996) (noting that officers are not required to conduct mini-trials\n\nbefore arrest).\n\n          We agree with the District Court that probable cause\n\nexisted to arrest Forest.   Therefore, there was no violation of\n\nForest’s Fourth Amendment rights, and the Pawtucket Defendants are\n\nentitled to qualified immunity.\n\n                                  IV.\n\n          Forest argues in the alternative that the Pawtucket\n\nPolice exaggerated the evidence presented in the arrest warrant\n\nknowing that Montella’s claim was not credible. A Fourth Amendment\n\nviolation may be established if a defendant can show that officers\n\nacted in reckless disregard, with a “high degree of awareness of\n\n[the statements’] probable falsity.”       Wilson v. Russo, 212 F.3d\n\n781, 788 (3d Cir. 2000) (citation omitted).       Forest asserts that\n\nthe officers acted with reckless disregard because they relied on\n\nwitnesses who were not present during the incident (i.e. Montella’s\n\n\n\n                               -12-\n\fmother and Principal Rousselle), and because the officers added\n\ninformation about Forest’s gift giving to the Montella family,\n\nwhich was speculative and irrelevant.\n\n            We believe that Forest’s claim of reckless disregard must\n\nfail.     First, the detectives did not rely on the statements of\n\nMontella’s mother and Principal Rousselle to verify the account of\n\nthe alleged assault in the classroom.             Rather, the detectives\n\nrelied on those statements to confirm (1) that Montella actually\n\nleft the classroom and went straight to the principal’s office to\n\nreport the incident, and (2) that Montella had complained of\n\ninappropriate touching by Forest in the past.           Both of these items\n\nwere    relevant   to   a   finding   of   probable   cause.     Second,   the\n\ninclusion of Forest’s generosity towards the Montellas in the past\n\nwas relevant when considered in the context explained by Montella’s\n\nmother.    Gail Montella stated that she believed her son’s claim\n\nbecause he had no reason to harbor any ill will towards Forest;\n\nForest had been kind to the Montellas in the past.             Therefore, the\n\ninclusion of this fact directly supports Montella’s credibility.\n\n            Forest also argues that the officers omitted crucial\n\nfacts from the affidavit, particularly that the alleged assault\n\ntook place in front of the entire class and the teaching assistant.\n\nYet, as explained above, Forest’s assertion that the incident took\n\nplace in front of the entire class is an overstatement.            The entire\n\nclass consisted of only five students including Montella, and only\n\ntwo of the students were facing Montella at the time of the alleged\n\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fincident.     Additionally, Montella alleged that the touching took\n\nplace under the pretense of Forest’s feeling his jacket, so under\n\nthis scenario, even an eye witness may not have realized what was\n\noccurring.    Therefore, the officer’s omission of these facts from\n\nthe affidavit was not misleading, and there is no basis for the\n\nclaim of reckless disregard.\n\n                                 V.\n\n             For the reasons set forth above, the District Court’s\n\ngrant of summary judgment is affirmed.    Each party is to bear its\n\nown cost.\n\n\n\n\n                                -14-\n\f",

The question is: how deep must a police investigation extend before there is sufficient probable cause for the arrest of a school teacher accused of sexually molesting a student? At stake is the professional career and reputation of a high school teacher on one hand, and on the other the safety, health, and moral values of the student.

The complaint led to an investigation and the arrest of the teacher by the Pawtucket, Rhode Island, Police Department. The charge against the teacher, Richard Forest (\"Forest\"), a Massachusetts resident, was ultimately dismissed by the state court. Forest thereupon brought a civil suit under 42 U.S.C. &#167;1983 in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island against the City of Pawtucket, the Police Department, and individual officers, claiming a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights under the Federal Constitution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The District Court found that the police officers had reasonable probable cause to arrest Forest and granted summary judgment in their favor. Forest timely appealed. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Forest had been employed by the Pawtucket School District in Rhode Island as a full-time special education teacher at Tolman High School for 30 years. At the time of the events relevant to this case, he taught a \"life skills\" course for special needs children. Jeffrey Montella (\"Montella\"), one of his students, left Forest's classroom on January 24, 2000, and went to the principal's office to report an incident of misconduct. Montella informed Principal Rousselle (\"Rousselle\") that Forest touched him inappropriately in a sexual manner during class. Montella provided a written statement to Rousselle detailing the incident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At approximately 5 p.m. that evening, Montella and his mother, Gail Montella, went to the Pawtucket Police Department and filed a complaint against Forest. Montella gave Officer Dennis Smith a written statement alleging that Forest \"grabbed and rubbed [his] penis during class.\" Montella also disclosed that Forest had rubbed his shoulders and legs in the past, in a way that made him uncomfortable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officer Smith referred the complaint to Detectives Scott Feeley and William Magill, who reinterviewed Montella and his mother on that same evening. During the second interview, Montella drew a diagram depicting the seating arrangement in the class at the time of the alleged incident. The diagram shows that when the misconduct allegedly occurred, there were four other students in the classroom, two sitting beside Montella and two sitting across the room facing him. A teaching assistant, Cheryl Ann Lainhart, was seated a short distance to the left of the row occupied by Montella and his two fellow students.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gail Montella also provided a written statement to the detectives. She affirmed that her son told her about the inappropriate touching that occurred earlier in the day, and that her son had complained in the past about Forest rubbing his shoulders and thigh. Ms. Montella explained that when her son originally complained of inappropriate touching, she did not believe it to be significant because she assumed that Forest was simply being nice to her son. She also assumed that Forest's attention to Montella was not out of the ordinary, as Forest had been generous with the Montella family in the past, giving them a large bag of gifts at Christmas and a $50 gift certificate to a grocery store. Ms. Montella explained in her statement that she believed her son's story about the alleged misconduct in the classroom because Forest had always been nice to her family, and therefore her son had no reason to lie in order to harm him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Detectives Feeley and Magill interviewed Principal Rousselle on the same evening of the complaint. Rousselle confirmed that Montella had come to his office during class that day, made an oral complaint, and provided a written statement regarding the incident. After confirming the incident with Rousselle, the detectives called Forest at 8:30 p.m., leaving a message on his answering machine, and again at 9:10 p.m., when they reached Forest on the phone. The detectives asked Forest to come to the police station, but Forest declined because he could not reach his attorney. At 10 p.m., after speaking with his attorney, Forest called the detectives and agreed to voluntarily appear at the police station. On January 26, 2000, Forest was arrested and charged with second degree sexual assault.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Detective Feeley prepared the affidavit in support of the arrest warrant on the evening of January 24, after he received the complaint from Montella, verified the incident with Montella's mother, and confirmed the incident with Principal Rousselle. Feeley did not interview Forest, the teaching assistant, or any other students present in the classroom at the time of the alleged incident. But, Feeley stated that he found Montella's claim to be credible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The affidavit in support of the arrest warrant recounted Montella's story, explaining that Forest asked Montella about his new fleece jacket, and allegedly rubbed Montella's penis while he reached upward to feel the jacket material. Feeley did not include in the affidavit an explanation that Montella was a special needs student taking Ritalin for his Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, nor did he indicate that there were other students in the classroom during the alleged incident who may have witnessed the event. Bail Commissioner Ernest Pratt reviewed the affidavit, found probable cause to arrest Forest, and signed the warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Pawtucket School Department investigated Montella's allegation and found that \"[t]here was no credible evidence presented that Jeffrey Montella was fondled sexually by Richard Forest in the Life Skills Class.\" Subsequently, the Rhode Island Attorney General's office declined to prosecute, and the Rhode Island state district court dismissed the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the charges were dismissed, Forest brought suit raising eleven counts against multiple defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Counts I through VII, which included claims brought under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments plus multiple state law claims, were raised against the city, the police department, and several officers involved (\"Pawtucket Defendants\"). Counts VIII through XI included state law claims raised against Montella and his family members (\"Montella Defendants\"). Only the Pawtucket Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted by the District Court. Therefore, counts VIII through XI involving the Montella Defendants were not considered on summary judgment before the District Court, and are not now before this court on appeal. Furthermore, Forest only appeals the District Court's grant of summary judgment on Count I involving the alleged violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. Our review is limited to this single issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Forest's Fourth Amendment claim asserts that his constitutional rights were violated because he was arrested without probable cause. The District Court granted summary judgment on this claim based on two separate, but related grounds. First, the District Court found that the detectives had probable cause to arrest Forest, and thus there was no constitutional violation. The Pawtucket Defendants were therefore entitled to qualified immunity. Second, the Court's finding of no constitutional violation also justified summary judgment on the merits of the &#167;1983 claim. <i>See Morales v. Ramirez,</i> 906 F.2d 784, 787 (1st Cir.1990) (explaining that although qualified immunity and the merits of &#167;1983 suit are separate inquiries, a finding of no constitutional violation may resolve both).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the District Court's grant of summary judgment <i>de novo. Grant's Dairy-Maine LLC v. Comm'r of Maine Dept. of Agric., Food and Rural Res.,</i> 232 F.3d 8, 14 (1st Cir.2000). We review all evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and will affirm if we conclude that there are no issues of material fact, and the Appellees deserve judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <i>Morrissey v. Boston Five Cents Savings Bank,</i> 54 F.3d 27, 31 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Qualified immunity is not a defense on the merits, but is \"an entitlement not to stand trial or face the other burdens of litigation.\" <i>Saucier v. Katz,</i> 533 U.S. 194, 200, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001) (citation omitted). Consequently, it is important to resolve the immunity question as early as possible in the litigation. <i>Id.</i> at 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151. Government officials will not be entitled to qualified immunity if their conduct violated a statutory or constitutional right that is \"clearly established.\" <i>Id.</i> Thus, the first threshold inquiry must be whether the facts, taken in the light most favorable to the party claiming injury, show that an officer's conduct violated a statutory or constitutional right. If the facts do not support the violation of a right, then the inquiry ends at that point, and the court does not proceed to the second question of whether the right allegedly violated was clearly established. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Probable cause analysis requires inquiry into the facts and circumstances within the arresting officer's knowledge at the time of arrest to determine if a person of \"reasonable caution and prudence\" would have believed that the defendant committed a crime. <i>Floyd v. Farrell,</i> 765 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1985). It does not require evidence to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. \"[P]robable cause need not be tantamount to proof beyond a reasonable doubt.... Probability is the touchstone.\" <i>U.S. v. Grant,</i> 218 F.3d 72, 75 (1st Cir.2000) (citation omitted). \"The probable cause standard does not require the officers' conclusion to be ironclad, or even highly probable. Their conclusion that probable cause exists need only be reasonable.\" <i>U.S. v. Winchenbach,</i> 197 F.3d 548, 555-56 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has affirmed that police officers can justifiably rely upon the credible complaint by a victim to support a finding of probable cause. <i>B.C.R. Transport Co., Inc. v. Fontaine,</i> 727 F.2d 7, 10 (1st Cir.1984) (noting that although not a per se rule, a probable cause determination predicated on information furnished by the victim is generally considered reliable). Therefore, the primary inquiry in this case is whether there is any evidence that the officers acted unreasonably when they determined that Montella's accusation was credible, in light of all the circumstances known at the time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Forest argues that the accusation was inherently unreliable because Montella alleged that the incident occurred in front of an entire classroom of students and a teaching aide, none of whom were interviewed prior to the arrest. However, the facts known to the detectives at the time of arrest do not support this conclusion. Montella did not claim that Forest molested him in clear view of an entire classroom of students. According to the diagram provided by Montella, there were only four other students and a teaching assistant in the class at the time of the incident, and only two of the other students were facing Montella. The others in the room were situated to Montella's side where they would not necessarily have had a clear view. Also, Montella explained that Forest was commenting on, and touching Montella's jacket when the alleged molestation occurred. Therefore, it was reasonable for the detectives to conclude that even an eye witness would not necessarily have recognized any inappropriate touching.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Forest also argues that because Montella was a special needs student, his credibility should have been questioned. But there is no evidence that Montella's condition of Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder, and his prescription of Ritalin, had any effect on his credibility. Rather, Detective Feeley believed that Montella was not mentally incapacitated in any relevant manner, and made an independent determination that Montella was \"fairly intelligent and credible.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Forest argues that under <i>BeVier v. Hucal,</i> 806 F.2d 123 (7th Cir.1986), the officers were required to interview readily available witnesses before seeking an arrest warrant. However, <i>BeVier</i> does not support Forest's argument. In <i>BeVier,</i> the police arrested two parents for child abuse with absolutely no investigation or evidence supporting the abuse, even though witnesses who could have been consulted were readily available. <i>Id.</i> at 128. In this case, the police did conduct an investigation. The detectives interviewed Montella twice to ascertain his primary accusation, interviewed his mother to verify the account and learn that Montella had complained in the past of inappropriate touching, and confirmed the events with Principal Rousselle. All of the information gleaned from these interviews and statements provided reasonable evidence to support probable cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Forest asserts that the officers should have interviewed the other students in the classroom and the teaching assistant before seeking the arrest warrant. However, the law is clear that once police officers are presented with probable cause to support an arrest, no further investigation is required at that point. <i>See, e.g., Brodnicki v. City of Omaha,</i> 75 F.3d 1261, 1264 (8th Cir.1996) (noting that officers are not required to conduct mini-trials before arrest).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the District Court that probable cause existed to arrest Forest. Therefore, there was no violation of Forest's Fourth Amendment rights, and the Pawtucket Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Forest argues in the alternative that the Pawtucket Police exaggerated the evidence presented in the arrest warrant knowing that Montella's claim was not credible. A Fourth Amendment violation may be established if a defendant can show that officers acted in reckless disregard, with a \"high degree of awareness of [the statements'] probable falsity.\" <i>Wilson v. Russo,</i> 212 F.3d 781, 788 (3d Cir.2000) (citation omitted). Forest asserts that the officers acted with reckless disregard because they relied on witnesses who were not present during the incident (i.e. Montella's mother and Principal Rousselle), and because the officers added information about Forest's gift giving to the Montella family, which was speculative and irrelevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe that Forest's claim of reckless disregard must fail. First, the detectives did not rely on the statements of Montella's mother and Principal Rousselle to verify the account of the alleged assault in the classroom. Rather, the detectives relied on those statements to confirm (1) that Montella actually left the classroom and went straight to the principal's office to report the incident, and (2) that Montella had complained of inappropriate touching by Forest in the past. Both of these items were relevant to a finding of probable cause. Second, the inclusion of Forest's generosity towards the Montellas in the past was relevant when considered in the context explained by Montella's mother. Gail Montella stated that she believed her son's claim because he had no reason to harbor any ill will towards Forest; Forest had been kind to the Montellas in the past. Therefore, the inclusion of this fact directly supports Montella's credibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Forest also argues that the officers omitted crucial facts from the affidavit, particularly that the alleged assault took place in front of the entire class and the teaching assistant. Yet, as explained above, Forest's assertion that the incident took place in front of the entire class is an overstatement. The entire class consisted of only five students including Montella, and only two of the students were facing Montella at the time of the alleged incident. Additionally, Montella alleged that the touching took place under the pretense of Forest's feeling his jacket, so under this scenario, even an eye witness may not have realized what was occurring. Therefore, the officer's omission of these facts from the affidavit was not misleading, and there is no basis for the claim of reckless disregard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons set forth above, the District Court's grant of summary judgment is affirmed.

Feeley did not include in the affidavit an explanation that Montella was a special needs student taking Ritalin for his Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, nor did he indicate that there were other students in the classroom during the alleged incident who may have witnessed the event.

Counts VIII through XI included state law claims raised against Montella and his family members (\"Montella Defendants\"). Only the Pawtucket Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted by the District Court. Therefore, counts VIII through XI involving the Montella Defendants were not considered on summary judgment before the District Court, and are not now before this court on appeal. Furthermore, Forest only appeals the District Court's grant of summary judgment on Count I involving the alleged violation of his Fourth Amendment rights.

The District Court granted summary judgment on this claim based on two separate, but related grounds. First, the District Court found that the detectives had probable cause to arrest Forest, and thus there was no constitutional violation. The Pawtucket Defendants were therefore entitled to qualified immunity. Second, the Court's finding of no constitutional violation also justified summary judgment on the merits of the &#167;1983 claim. <i>See Morales v.

Transport Co., Inc. v. Fontaine,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"430971\"><a href=\"/opinion/430971/bcr-transport-co-inc-v-norman-fontaine/\"><span class=\"volume\">727</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 10 (1st Cir.1984) (noting that although not a per se rule, a probable cause determination predicated on information furnished by the victim is generally considered reliable). Therefore, the primary inquiry in this case is whether there is any evidence that the officers acted unreasonably when they determined that Montella's accusation was credible, in light of all the circumstances known at the time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Forest argues that the accusation was inherently unreliable because Montella alleged that the incident occurred in front of an entire classroom of students and a teaching aide, none of whom were interviewed prior to the arrest. However, the facts known to the detectives at the time of arrest do not support this conclusion. Montella did not claim that Forest molested him in clear view of an entire classroom of students. According to the diagram provided by Montella, there were only four other students and a teaching assistant in the class at the time of the incident, and only two of the other students were facing Montella. The others in the room were situated to Montella's side where they would not necessarily have had a clear view. Also, Montella explained that Forest was commenting on, and touching Montella's jacket when the alleged molestation occurred. Therefore, it was reasonable for the detectives to conclude that even an eye witness would not necessarily have recognized any inappropriate touching.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Forest also argues that because Montella was a special needs student, his credibility should have been questioned. But there is no evidence that Montella's condition of Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder, and his prescription of Ritalin, had any effect on his credibility. Rather, Detective Feeley believed that Montella was not mentally incapacitated in any relevant manner, and made an independent determination that Montella was \"fairly intelligent and credible.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Forest argues that under <i>BeVier v. Hucal,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"479889\"><a href=\"/opinion/479889/robert-bevier-and-annette-bevier-v-steven-hucal/\"><span class=\"volume\">806</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">123</span></a></span> (7th Cir.1986), the officers were required to interview readily available witnesses before seeking an arrest warrant. However, <i>BeVier</i> does not support Forest's argument. In <i>BeVier,</i> the police arrested two parents for child abuse with absolutely no investigation or evidence supporting the abuse, even though witnesses who could have been consulted were readily available. <i>Id.</i> at 128. In this case, the police did conduct an investigation. The detectives interviewed Montella twice to ascertain his primary accusation, interviewed his mother to verify the account and learn that Montella had complained in the past of inappropriate touching, and confirmed the events with Principal Rousselle. All of the information gleaned from these interviews and statements provided reasonable evidence to support probable cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Forest asserts that the officers should have interviewed the other students in the classroom and the teaching assistant before seeking the arrest warrant. However, the law is clear that once police officers are presented with probable cause to support an arrest, no further investigation is required at that point. <i>See, e.g., Brodnicki v. City of Omaha,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"712213\"><a href=\"/opinion/712213/edward-brodnicki-v-city-of-omaha-nebraska-a-municipal-corporation-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1261</span></a></span>, 1264 (8th Cir.1996) (noting that officers are not required to conduct mini-trials before arrest).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the District Court that probable cause existed to arrest Forest. Therefore, there was no violation of Forest's Fourth Amendment rights, and the Pawtucket Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Forest argues in the alternative that the Pawtucket Police exaggerated the evidence presented in the arrest warrant knowing that Montella's claim was not credible. A Fourth Amendment violation may be established if a defendant can show that officers acted in reckless disregard, with a \"high degree of awareness of [the statements'] probable falsity.\" <i>Wilson v. Russo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768725\"><a href=\"/opinion/768725/no-98-5283/\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">781</span></a></span>, 788 (3d Cir.2000) (citation omitted). Forest asserts that the officers acted with reckless disregard because they relied on witnesses who were not present during the incident (i.e. Montella's mother and Principal Rousselle), and because the officers added information about Forest's gift giving to the Montella family, which was speculative and irrelevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe that Forest's claim of reckless disregard must fail. First, the detectives did not rely on the statements of Montella's mother and Principal Rousselle to verify the account of the alleged assault in the classroom. Rather, the detectives relied on those statements to confirm (1) that Montella actually left the classroom and went straight to the principal's office to report the incident, and (2) that Montella had complained of inappropriate touching by Forest in the past. Both of these items were relevant to a finding of probable cause. Second, the inclusion of Forest's generosity towards the Montellas in the past was relevant when considered in the context explained by Montella's mother. Gail Montella stated that she believed her son's claim because he had no reason to harbor any ill will towards Forest; Forest had been kind to the Montellas in the past. Therefore, the inclusion of this fact directly supports Montella's credibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Forest also argues that the officers omitted crucial facts from the affidavit, particularly that the alleged assault took place in front of the entire class and the teaching assistant. Yet, as explained above, Forest's assertion that the incident took place in front of the entire class is an overstatement. The entire class consisted of only five students including Montella, and only two of the students were facing Montella at the time of the alleged incident. Additionally, Montella alleged that the touching took place under the pretense of Forest's feeling his jacket, so under this scenario, even an eye witness may not have realized what was occurring. Therefore, the officer's omission of these facts from the affidavit was not misleading, and there is no basis for the claim of reckless disregard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons set forth above, the District Court's grant of summary judgment is affirmed.
