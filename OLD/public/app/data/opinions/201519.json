José A. Fusté, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                      Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                   Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                     and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Alexander Zeno for appellant.\n     Thomas Klumper, Assistant U.S. Attorney, with whom H.S.\nGarcía, U.S. Attorney, and Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant U.S.\nAttorney and Senior Appellate Attorney, were on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n                           April 5, 2005\n\f          LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.    On January 8, 2001, Juan Manuel\n\nCruzado Laureano, sometimes called \"Manny\" for short, took office\n\nas mayor of Vega Alta, one of Puerto Rico's municipalities.      On\n\nJanuary 25, 2002, a federal grand jury returned a superseding\n\nindictment that charged him with a number of crimes tied to abuse\n\nof his public office, including extortion, embezzlement, theft,\n\nmoney laundering, and witness tampering.      After a fourteen-day\n\ntrial, Cruzado was convicted of the following charges: one count of\n\nembezzlement from a program receiving federal funds, 18 U.S.C. §\n\n666(a)(1)(A)(i) and (a)(1)(A)(ii); five counts of extortion, id. §\n\n1951(a); five counts of money laundering, id. § 1956(a)(1)(B)(i)\n\nand (a)(1)(B)(ii); and one count of tampering with witnesses, id.\n\n§ 1512(b)(1) and (b)(2).    The district court sentenced Cruzado to\n\n63 months' imprisonment on all counts except for the witness\n\ntampering, for which Cruzado received 12 months.     The sentences\n\nwere to run concurrently with each other.   In this appeal, Cruzado\n\nchallenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his counts of\n\nconviction.   He also argues that his sentence was erroneously\n\ncalculated.   Although we affirm the convictions, we vacate the\n\nsentence and remand for resentencing.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          We first provide a brief overview of the case, taking our\n\ninformation from the record as viewed in the light most favorable\n\nto the jury's verdict.     See United States v. Lara, 181 F.3d 183,\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\f190 (1st Cir. 1999).       We reserve a fuller discussion of the facts\n\nfor later sections to which they are particularly relevant.\n\n            After graduating from the University of Puerto Rico in\n\n1969, Cruzado taught advanced mathematics at a local high school\n\nuntil   1976.      At   that    point,      he   moved     into   the   construction\n\nbusiness.    In 1992, he went into business with his then-wife, a\n\npediatric dentist, who opened a medical practice, incorporated as\n\nOficina Dental Las Colinas, Inc., often referred to by its acronym,\n\nOnaden,   Inc.      From       1992   to    1995,     Cruzado     handled     routine\n\nadministrative tasks for Onaden, including the opening of a bank\n\naccount at a local branch of Banco Popular, which would later prove\n\nuseful to his criminal endeavors.                  The account, in the name of\n\nOficina   Dental    Las    Colinas,        Inc.,    with    Cruzado     as   the   only\n\nsignatory, was used for such items as lease payments. When Cruzado\n\nbecame mayor, however, he did not disclose the account’s existence\n\nas required by the Ethics Office for the Commonwealth of Puerto\n\nRico.\n\n            From 1996 to 2000, Cruzado ran a check-cashing business,\n\nEl Cajero Expresso. In November 2000, Cruzado was elected mayor of\n\nVega Alta -- his first try at running for public office -- as a\n\nmember of the Popular Democratic Party and was duly sworn into\n\noffice on January 8, 2001.            Upon his election, Cruzado appears to\n\nhave sold the check-cashing business to his oldest son, who took\n\nover day-to-day control.         Cruzado, however, retained the last word\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fin business affairs and kept control over the business's checking\n\naccount.\n\n              Within a scant few weeks of becoming mayor, Cruzado began\n\nusing his official position to embezzle and extort thousands of\n\ndollars from the municipality and from contractors who were working\n\nfor the municipality; he then laundered the money in the Onaden\n\nbank account.       We now describe the particulars of his criminal\n\nactivity.      (See the chart, attached as an appendix, for a summary\n\nof the charges and parties involved.)\n\n              A.   Cristalería Vega Alta, Inc.\n\n              Cristalería Vega Alta is a firm that installs and repairs\n\nglass   and    aluminum   doors.   Cristalería's    owner,   Juan   Cuevas\n\nRodríguez, first got to know Cruzado through Cristalería's glass\n\nwork for Cruzado's construction business.         Shortly after Cruzado\n\ntook office in January 2001, he embarked on an extensive program to\n\nrenovate Vega Alta's city hall, which was in poor shape.            Cruzado\n\nrequested that Cristalería perform some locksmithing and remodeling\n\nwork on the building, and he asked Cuevas for a price estimate.\n\nCuevas quoted a price of $5,814.         Cruzado then told Cuevas to add\n\n$2,000 to his quote and give the extra money to him.         Fearing that\n\nhe might be cut off from future work if he disobeyed, Cuevas\n\nobliged.\n\n              Cristalería’s contract provided that the company would be\n\npaid from a trust account of the municipality at Banco Santander,\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fwhose funds were reserved for making improvements to the city hall.\n\nFor some reason, there was a delay in the disbursement of those\n\nfunds. Cruzado spoke to Vega Alta’s director of finance, Damien O.\n\nColón Pabón, telling him that Cristalería was getting impatient\n\nabout the delay and asking whether the municipality could expedite\n\npayment.    Colón told Cruzado that the municipality’s regular\n\nchecking account might be faster, although disbursing funds from\n\nthat account would require additional paperwork: price quotes,\n\ninvoices, and various other papers.     Also, when Banco Santander\n\neventually made the disbursement from the trust account, that money\n\nwould have to be put into the municipality’s checking account.\n\n           Cruzado then informed Cuevas that, to be paid, he would\n\nneed to procure some other, competing bids that were higher than\n\nCristalería's.   Cuevas complied: he approached two competing glass\n\nshops and told them to prepare fake bids that were higher than\n\nCristalería's quote.   They agreed to do so, even though they had no\n\nintention of submitting a formal bid for the work.\n\n           On April 4, 2001, the check from the trust account to pay\n\nCristalería for its work was delivered to Cruzado’s office.   Colón\n\nrequested that the mayor deposit the check into the municipality’s\n\nchecking account.   The mayor responded that Cristalería would be\n\nworking for the municipality in the future, and that the check\n\nwould be used to pay for that work.    Colón criticized that plan,\n\nreaffirming that the check should go into Vega Alta’s checking\n\n\n                                -5-\n\faccount and that, if Cristalería needed to be paid for new work,\n\nthen a new contract should be drawn up and the disbursements could\n\nbe    made    on   that    basis.     Cruzado         assured      Colón    that   those\n\nformalities        were   not   necessary;      he    would     be   responsible     for\n\nretaining the check and making payments to Cristalería.\n\n              Cristalería was then paid twice for its work, receiving\n\nchecks from both of Vega Alta's bank accounts.                       Specifically, on\n\nMarch 23, 2001, Cuevas picked up a check from city hall, drawn on\n\nthe municipality's regular checking account, for the inflated price\n\nof $8,549 (minus a certain sum that Cuevas owed the municipality in\n\nlicensing fees). Cuevas deposited that check in Cristalería’s bank\n\naccount.      Then, on April 4, 2001, Cuevas received a visit in his\n\noffice from Cruzado, who came bearing another check, this one also\n\nfor $8,549 (again, minus certain immaterial deductions) drawn from\n\nthe   trust    account.         Cruzado   told       Cuevas   to     take   the    check,\n\nexplaining that Cristalería would earn the double payment by doing\n\nmore jobs for Vega Alta in the future.                   The next day, April 5,\n\n2001, Cuevas issued two checks drawn on Cristalería’s account, each\n\nfor $2,000: one made out to \"cash,\" and one made out to \"Onaden,\n\nInc.,\" according to Cruzado's instructions.                     Cruzado's chauffeur\n\ncashed the first check at the check-cashing business of Cruzado’s\n\nson and gave Cruzado the money, while Cruzado deposited the second\n\ncheck into the Onaden account at Banco Popular.\n\n              In early October 2001, Cruzado asked to meet with Cuevas,\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\ftelling him he had something important to discuss. He claimed that\n\nhe was being audited, and that he was nervous about the $2,000\n\ncheck that Cuevas had issued to Onaden, Inc.         Cruzado told Cuevas\n\nthat, if asked about the check, he should say that it was a\n\nrepayment of a loan extended to him by Cruzado before becoming\n\nmayor.\n\n            B.   Sidney Travel and Tours, Inc.\n\n            In 2001, Vega Alta was celebrating its 225th anniversary\n\nand, at Cruzado’s request, the organizers of the annual Puerto Rico\n\nDay Parade in New York were going to dedicate that year’s parade to\n\nthe town.    As mayor, Cruzado formed a committee, called the Puerto\n\nRico Day Parade Committee, to raise money and arrange for Vega\n\nAlta’s delegation to travel to New York for the June parade.             The\n\ncommittee,    which    was   composed   of   governmental    employees   and\n\nrepresentatives from local cultural groups, opened a checking\n\naccount under the name “Centro Cultural de Vega Alta,” which had\n\ntwo signatories, neither of whom was Cruzado.        The Committee chose\n\na local travel agency, Sidney Travel and Tours, to arrange for\n\nairplane tickets, ground transportation, and hotels.            Cruzado was\n\nthe only member of the committee who was handling lodging and hotel\n\naccommodations.       Sidney Travel’s owner, Lilia Alonso Alvarez, had\n\nnumerous contacts over the next few months with the committee while\n\nplanning the trip to New York.          Between April and June 2001, the\n\ncommittee    raised      about   $160,000:     $40,000      given   by   the\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fmunicipality’s assembly, the rest through private donations.                           Any\n\nmoney    not    needed     for    the   trip       was   to   be   refunded       to   the\n\nmunicipality.\n\n               The committee put down an initial deposit with Sidney\n\nTravel to secure plane and hotel reservations.                     As the date of the\n\nparade neared and the travel arrangements assumed their final form,\n\nAlonso   calculated      that     (1)   the    committee       owed      Sidney   Travel\n\n$67,240.90; and (2) Sidney Travel owed the committee a refund of\n\n$14,816.74, which could be offset against the larger amount.\n\nAlonso informed the committee of her tally.                        On May 25, 2001,\n\nCruzado arrived at Sidney Travel for a financial reckoning, bearing\n\na blank check from Centro Cultural's account.                            He was alone.\n\nInstead of allowing Alonso to credit the entire $14,816.74 to the\n\ncommittee's account, Cruzado told her that he wanted part of the\n\ncredit as a separate payment, which would be useful to him as food\n\nmoney    for    children    who    would      be    attending      the    parade.       So\n\ninstructed, Alonso made out a check for $5,816.74 to Onaden, Inc.,\n\nand credited the remaining $9,000 to the committee's balance.                          The\n\nmayor then paid off the balance with a Centro Cultural check for\n\n$58,240.90.      He later deposited the Onaden check into his private\n\naccount.\n\n               In New York, Cruzado stayed at the Grand Hyatt Hotel,\n\nwhile most of Vega Alta’s other parade attendees stayed at the\n\nMarriot Marquis.         On June 11, 2001, the day after the parade,\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fCruzado sent a messenger to speak to Marilyn García, who served as\n\none of the two signatories on Centro Cultural checks.     Cruzado’s\n\nmessage: he wanted three signed, blank checks drawn on the Centro\n\nCultural account. García handed over the checks. Cruzado made out\n\nthe first two checks to the Grand Hyatt; the third, he made out to\n\nOnaden, Inc., in the amount of $4,164.   On July 3, 2001, that check\n\nwas deposited in the Onaden account.\n\n          On July 6, 2001, after the trip was over, Sidney Travel\n\nmade a final accounting.   Again, a refund was due to the committee.\n\nCruzado went to Sidney Travel himself and instructed Alonso to\n\nissue a check in the name of Onaden, Inc., for $8,174.80.    Later,\n\nthat check was deposited into Onaden’s account.\n\n          On August 3, 2001, the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\nspoke to Alonso about Cruzado’s role in the committee’s travel\n\npreparations.    The next day, she informed Cruzado of the FBI’s\n\ninterest in his dealings.    Cruzado then made out an Onaden check\n\nfor $13,991.54 (the total of Sidney Travel's May 25 and July 6\n\nchecks to Onaden), dated it July 7, 2001, and deposited it into the\n\nCentro Cultural account on August 13, 2001.\n\n          C.    Vega Alta Medical Hospital, Inc.\n\n          Like city hall, Vega Alta’s local health clinic, the\n\nCentro de Diagnóstico y Tratamiento (CDT), needed renovations.\n\nLocated throughout Puerto Rico, CDTs provide basic health care to\n\n\n\n\n                                -9-\n\flocal populations.1        Shortly before the events of this case, Puerto\n\nRico had privatized many CDTs.           Vega Alta’s CDT had been purchased\n\nby a partnership formed by two doctors: Luis González Bermúdez and\n\nEmilio Rivera Costas.        The partnership was named Vega Alta Medical\n\nHospital, Inc.      The partners divided their responsibilities: Dr.\n\nGonzález was      the    medical      director,   while   Dr.    Rivera    was   the\n\nadministrator, handling tasks relating to maintenance, repair, and\n\nmanagement.       The      partners    had   agreed    with     the    municipality\n\n(although not in a written contract) that Vega Alta would provide\n\ntwo    services     --     ambulance     service,     crucial     to    the   CDT’s\n\nfunctioning, as well as groundskeeping.               Vega Alta had also agreed\n\nto donate an old, unused mobile health vehicle, which the CDT could\n\nrepair and then use to provide health care to rural and outlying\n\nareas.     Dr. González testified that the municipality was in charge\n\nof    maintaining    and    fixing     the   CDT's    physical    facilities,     as\n\ndirected by Dr. Rivera.\n\n             Vega Alta’s CDT also lacked air conditioning in the\n\nemergency room and administrative offices, a violation of Puerto\n\nRico’s health code.         The doctors had been soliciting quotes from\n\nseveral air-conditioning businesses to remedy the problem.                        In\n\n\n\n       1\n       Puerto Rican law defines a CDT as \"an independent facility\nor one operated in conjunction with a hospital which provides\ncommunity services for the diagnosis and treatment of ambulatory\npatients under the professional supervision of persons licensed to\npractice medicine, surgery or dentistry in Puerto Rico.\" 24 P.R.\nLaws Ann. § 331a(A)(4).\n\n                                        -10-\n\fJanuary 2001, Cruzado visited the CDT for the first time, where he\n\nmet with Dr. Rivera, who explained to him some of their problems.\n\nCruzado said that he would send over a company, Martínez Air\n\nConditioning, who had done some work for the municipality in the\n\npast, and that Dr. Rivera need not continue seeking bids.              Cruzado\n\nalso informed Dr. Rivera that Martínez Air Conditioning would\n\ninstall an air-conditioning unit in the CDT’s dentistry office,\n\nlocated in a dilapidated and partially abandoned annex to the main\n\nbuilding.    Dr. Rivera protested that his priority was to get air\n\nconditioning for the emergency room, but Cruzado persisted.\n\n            Cruzado subsequently paid the CDT another visit to speak\n\nto Dr. González, Dr. Rivera’s partner.            The two men were alone.\n\nCruzado explained that his political party was trying to raise\n\nmoney   through    donations.       Feeling     pressured   by   the   mayor’s\n\nauthority and aware of the CDT’s critical need for ambulance\n\nservice from the municipality, Dr. González told him that he would\n\ncontribute, even though Dr. González did not belong to the mayor’s\n\npolitical party.     At the time, however, Dr. González did not give\n\nthe mayor any money.\n\n            Martínez Air Conditioning then arrived on the premises,\n\ninstalled the air conditioner in the dentistry office, and invoiced\n\nthe   CDT   for   $2,895,   which   the   CDT   did   not   immediately   pay.\n\nMeanwhile, Martínez sent an invoice to the municipality for the\n\nsame amount, from which he received a check on May 4, 2001.\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fShortly thereafter, the mayor asked Martínez to remove the air\n\nconditioner from the CDT, for reasons known only to himself, and to\n\ntake it to a nearby police station.           Martínez did so, and was paid\n\nfor his trouble with an $850 check from the municipality dated June\n\n14, 2001.2\n\n             On July 10, 2001, Cruzado arrived at the CDT and asked\n\nfor money from Dr. Rivera, who understood the payment to be related\n\nto the air conditioner (which, by then, had already been both\n\ninstalled and removed).      Dr. Rivera testified that he knew nothing\n\nabout the political contribution that Cruzado and Dr. González had\n\ndiscussed.    Dr. Rivera asked for an invoice; Cruzado left for five\n\nor   ten   minutes   and   returned    with    an   invoice    for   $5,000   on\n\nletterhead reading “Onaden, Inc.”            The invoice referred, however,\n\nto work performed by Martínez Air Conditioning.3\n\n             Dr. Rivera had a blank payroll check available that had\n\nalready been signed by Dr. González.            When Dr. Rivera called Dr.\n\nGonzález to inform him of the impending payment, the two partners\n\ndid not discuss the purpose of the payment.                Dr. Rivera merely\n\n\n      2\n        The record does not disclose                if   the   emergency   room\neventually got an air conditioner.\n      3\n       We note that the CDT had already received one invoice from\nMartínez Air Conditioning. Apparently, the CDT had also received\nan invoice from the municipality for the same air conditioner.\nAccording to Dr. González, however, the municipality bore the\nultimate responsibility for maintaining the CDT’s physical\nfacilities. Given the various invoices flying back and forth, the\nprecise division of financial obligations between the CDT and the\nmunicipality for the cost of the air conditioner is unclear.\n\n                                      -12-\n\finformed Dr. González that the mayor was there looking for money,\n\nand Dr. González said that paying him was fine.          According to their\n\ntestimony, Dr. Rivera understood the payment to be for the air\n\nconditioner, and Dr. González understood the payment to be the\n\npolitical    contribution    that    he    had   discussed   with   the   mayor\n\nearlier.    Dr. Rivera then handed Cruzado a $5,000 check made out to\n\nOnaden.\n\n            Later in October, while being investigated by the FBI,\n\nCruzado spoke to Dr. Rivera.        Cruzado told Dr. Rivera to “tell the\n\ntruth,” which, according to Cruzado, was that the payment was a\n\npolitical donation.      Dr. Rivera refused, saying that he would\n\nmaintain that the payment was for the air conditioner, as evidenced\n\nby the invoice.\n\n            D. Ebanistería Familia\n\n            Ebanistería Familia is a woodworking shop in Vega Alta\n\nowned by Pedro A. Colón Muñoz, who knew Cruzado from patronizing\n\nhis check-cashing business.         During his mayoral campaign, Cruzado\n\nasked Colón for wooden poles to support advertising banners, which\n\nColón provided free of charge.            Soon after his election, Cruzado\n\ncalled Colón to city hall, where he explained that he wanted some\n\nglasswork and woodwork done in the lobby of the building, including\n\nseven wooden doors and some mahogany cabinets.               Colón took some\n\nmeasurements and quoted a price of $7,500.           Cruzado then requested\n\nsome additional work.       On February 12, 2001, Colón gave Cruzado a\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fwritten price quote for $9,200, which included the requested extra\n\nwork.   Colón testified that, typically, he requested a 50 percent\n\ndeposit from customers before beginning work, which he uses to buy\n\nmaterials.    He was told by Cruzado, however, that the municipality\n\ndid not pay such deposits.   Cruzado then offered to lend Colón the\n\nmoney from his son's check-cashing business.       Colón went to El\n\nCajero Expresso and received $5,200.\n\n             After Colón had begun the work, Cruzado told him to\n\nreduce the scope of the project, eliminating much of the extra work\n\nwhich would have raised the project cost to $9,200. Colón complied\n\nand eventually installed the woodwork at city hall.      On April 4,\n\n2001, Cruzado arrived at Colón’s place of business bearing a $8,556\n\ncheck ($9,200 minus 7 percent taxes), drawn on the municipality’s\n\ntrust fund at Banco Santander.         Evidently, the municipality's\n\npayment had not been adjusted downward to account for the reduced\n\nwork.    Cruzado asked Colón to take the check and give the excess\n\nfunds back in the form of a check payable to cash.     Colón’s wife,\n\na certified public accountant who helped with the family business,\n\nlater prepared a check payable to herself for $6,956 (the $5,200\n\nloan plus the municipality’s $1,756 overpayment), endorsed it, and\n\ngave the check to Colón.     Colón dropped off the check, which was\n\nnow as good as cash, at the check-cashing business of Cruzado's\n\nson.    The check was later cashed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -14-\n\f           E. Premier Electrical and General Contractors, Inc.\n\n           Premier Electrical and General Contractors, Inc. (Premier\n\nElectrical), was owned by Juan Marrero Visalden, an electrician.\n\nOn June 19, 2001, Marrero contracted with Vega Alta (Cruzado signed\n\nthe contract) to build a local indoor basketball court, which would\n\ninclude cement foundations, bathrooms, a cafeteria, sidewalks,\n\nwiring work, and drainage.         The base price for the project was\n\n$293,000; with some additional items, the total price was $342,000.\n\nAfter signing the contract, Premier Electrical began work in June\n\nor July.\n\n           Cruzado paid occasional visits to the site, observing the\n\nwork and making casual conversation with Marrero.          On one visit in\n\nSeptember, Cruzado asked Marrero for a $10,000 payment for the\n\nCentro Cultural de Vega Alta.       Marrero, who testified that he felt\n\n“rather stunned” by the request, agreed to pay. When Marrero asked\n\nhow he could contact Cruzado, the mayor gave Marrero his business\n\ncard, on which he had written his cell phone number.\n\n           On September 28, 2001, Marrero issued a $10,000 check\n\npayable to   “Centro    Cultural    de   Vega   Alta,”   drawn   on   Premier\n\nElectrical’s account. By coincidence, that same day Cruzado showed\n\nup at the project site.     When Marrero told him that the check was\n\nready, however, the mayor told him to prepare a different check\n\npayable to “cash.”     The mayor said that he needed the money to take\n\ncare of some “problems” at the Centro Cultural.            On October 15,\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\f2001, Marrero followed those instructions, issued the new check,\n\nand gave it to the mayor at his office in city hall.\n\n          After   Cruzado   was    arrested   on    October    24,   Marrero\n\ndiscovered that the check had not been cashed yet.            The next day,\n\nhe ordered his bank to stop payment on it.         Later, when Cruzado had\n\nposted bond, he paid another visit to the project site.              Cruzado\n\nasked what Marrero had done with the check.         When Marrero told him\n\nthat he had stopped payment on it, Cruzado told him he had done, in\n\nMarrero’s words, “a good job.”\n\n          Later, when Cruzado was no longer mayor, he kept calling\n\nMarrero. For example, he informed Marrero that his company had won\n\na bid that it had submitted to Vega Alta for improvements to a\n\nlocal baseball field.   Marrero knew that he had won the bid but had\n\nyet to receive any official papers confirming that fact.             In that\n\nconversation, Cruzado also asked him whether he had met with the\n\nFBI.   When Marrero admitted that he had, Cruzado told him that he\n\nwould have to call him back. Eventually, Marrero felt compelled to\n\nretain an attorney, who sent a letter to Cruzado asking that he\n\nstop calling and checking into Marrero’s business affairs.\n\n           F. Mundo Construction, Inc.\n\n           Mundo Construction, Inc., owned by Luis A. Vargas López,\n\ndid business under the name Ferretería Mundo as a construction\n\ncompany and hardware store.       Like Colón, the owner of Ebanistería\n\nFamilia, Vargas knew Cruzado from using his check-cashing business.\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\fVargas, too, helped with Cruzado’s mayoral campaign, setting up\n\nplatforms for political rallies without charge. In September 2001,\n\nCruzado took Vargas to a neighborhood in Vega Alta, where they\n\ndiscussed a possible construction project involving sidewalks,\n\ncurbs, and drainage.        Cruzado asked for a price quote from Vargas.\n\nA few days later, after taking some measurements, Vargas delivered\n\na written estimate of $39,500 to the clerk’s office at city hall.\n\nVargas then received a telephone call from the mayor, who asked him\n\nto add $2,000 to his quote.         Vargas refused, explaining that he was\n\nreluctant to pass the $40,000 mark in his bid.4                    Moreover, Vargas\n\nbelieved that Cruzado wanted the extra money for his private\n\nbenefit.    Consequently, Vargas refused to add $2,000 to his bid,\n\nand Cruzado then told him that the project would not be built\n\nbecause    of   a   lack    of    funds.         Cruzado    was   arrested     shortly\n\nthereafter, and another contractor later completed most of the work\n\nthat Cruzado and Vargas had discussed.\n\n                                           II.\n\n            Some     time    in    2001,     the     federal      government    began\n\ninvestigating       Cruzado's     conduct.         During    that    investigation,\n\nCruzado added to his troubles when he attempted to tamper with\n\n\n\n     4\n        For contracts worth more than $40,000, prospective\ncontractors had to satisfy more formal bidding requirements imposed\nby Vega Alta. It appears that the price for the total project was\nalready over $40,000, having been divided, somewhat artificially,\ninto one bid for the sidewalks and curbs – $39,500 – and another\nbid for the drainage.\n\n                                       -17-\n\fpotential witnesses, the owners of Cristalería and Vega Alta\n\nMedical Hospital.       The mayor was eventually indicted and arrested\n\non October 24, 2001.      Cruzado posted bond on November 2, 2001, and\n\nwas released, whereupon he tampered with another potential witness,\n\nthe owner of Premier Electrical.\n\n            On January 25, 2002, the grand jury returned a 14-count\n\nsuperseding      indictment,   charging   Cruzado    with   the   following\n\noffenses:\n\n            •     Count 1: embezzlement, 18 U.S.C. § 666(a)(1)(A)(i)\n                  and (a)(1)(A)(ii);\n            •     Counts 2, 4, 6, 12, 13, & 14: extortion, id. §\n                  1951(a);\n            •     Counts 3, 5, 7, 8, 9 & 10: money laundering, id. §\n                  1956(a)(1)(B)(i) and 1956(a)(1)(B)(ii);\n            •     Count   11:  tampering   with  witnesses,   id.  §\n                  1512(b)(1) and 1512(b)(2).\n\nThese counts are listed on the chart attached as an appendix to\n\nthis opinion, which shows how Cruzado's laundering counts all\n\nderive from money that he was charged with embezzling or extorting.\n\n            Trial began on May 20, 2002.           The government used a\n\ncombination of testimony from Cruzado’s victims and acquaintances,\n\nalong with documentary evidence of cancelled checks and the like,\n\nto build its case.      After the government rested on May 28, Cruzado\n\nfiled a motion for judgment of acquittal on counts 1, 4 through 10,\n\nand 11 (thereby declining to challenge counts 2, 3, 12, 13, and\n\n14).   That motion was denied.\n\n            In    his   defense,   through   the    cross-examination    of\n\ngovernment witnesses and his own testimony, Cruzado tried to\n\n                                   -18-\n\fcharacterize some payments as political contributions; as for\n\nothers, he stressed that they had been innocent mistakes and that\n\nhe had eventually returned the money (he had returned some payments\n\nafter the government had begun investigating his dealings).      He\n\nalso used character witnesses.\n\n            After Cruzado rested his case on June 5, he renewed his\n\nmotion for judgment of acquittal, which the court granted as to\n\ncount 10.     On June 7, the jury found Cruzado guilty on all\n\nremaining counts except count 12, for which it returned a verdict\n\nof not guilty.     On June 14, Cruzado filed a second motion for\n\njudgment of acquittal as to all remaining counts except 2, 3, 13,\n\nand 14, which the court denied on July 31, 2002.    On November 8,\n\n2002, Cruzado was sentenced to 63 months in prison for Counts 1\n\nthrough 9, 13, and 14; and 1 year for Count 11, the terms to run\n\nconcurrently.    More than a year later, on November 24, 2003, the\n\ndistrict court ordered Cruzado to pay restitution in the amount of\n\n$14,251.82 to Vega Alta.5   This appeal followed.\n\n                                 III.\n\n            We review de novo a district court’s denial of a motion\n\nfor judgment of acquittal under Fed. R. Crim. P. 29.6   Our task is\n\n\n     5\n       The government told us at oral argument that the district\ncourt had not made any findings as to loss amounts. It apparently\noverlooked the district court’s restitution order.\n     6\n       Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(a) provides in part: \"After the\ngovernment closes its evidence or after the close of all the\nevidence, the court on the defendant's motion must enter a judgment\n\n                                 -19-\n\fto decide “whether, after assaying all the evidence in the light\n\nmost   amiable   to   the   government,   and    taking   all   reasonable\n\ninferences in its favor, a rational factfinder could find, beyond\n\na reasonable doubt, that the prosecution successfully proved the\n\nessential elements of the crime.”         United States v. O’Brien, 14\n\nF.3d 703, 706 (1st Cir. 1994); see also United States v. Piper, 298\n\nF.3d 47, 59 (1st Cir. 2002).     The government may satisfy its burden\n\nof proof \"by either direct or circumstantial evidence, or by any\n\ncombination thereof.\"       United States v. Gifford, 17 F.3d 462, 467\n\n(1st Cir. 1994).       Moreover, we must \"resolve all credibility\n\ndisputes in the verdict's favor.\" United States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d\n\n967, 974 (1st Cir. 1995).      Ultimately, the court \"need not believe\n\nthat no verdict other than a guilty verdict could sensibly be\n\nreached, but must only satisfy itself that the guilty verdict finds\n\nsupport in a plausible rendition of the record.\"          United States v.\n\nGomez, 255 F.3d 31, 35 (1st Cir. 2001) (citation and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n           Those daunting hurdles apply to the counts that Cruzado\n\ncontested below with a Rule 29 motion.          He faces an even greater\n\nchallenge on the counts that he did not so contest: counts 2, 3,\n\n13, and 14.   Cruzado's failure to move for judgment of acquittal on\n\nthose counts means that he must show “clear and gross injustice” to\n\n\n\nof acquittal of any offense for which the evidence is insufficient\nto sustain a conviction.\"\n\n                                   -20-\n\fprevail now.7         United States v.

With   those     principles     in    mind,    we     assess    the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence, beginning with Cruzado’s unpreserved\n\nchallenges.\n\n                     A.    Cruzado's unpreserved challenges\n\n               1.    Three counts of extortion (Counts 2, 13, and 14)\n\n               To establish a violation of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. §\n\n1951, the government must prove three elements beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt:      (i)     that   the    defendant   induced      someone     to    part    with\n\nproperty; (ii) that the defendant knowingly and willfully did so by\n\nextortionate means; and (iii) that the extortionate transaction\n\naffected       interstate        commerce.      Id.   §    1951(a).8        “The     term\n\n‘extortion’ means the obtaining of property from another, with his\n\nconsent, induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force,\n\nviolence, or fear, or under color of official right.”                               Id. §\n\n1951(b)(2).\n\n               Extortion by \"fear\" can mean fear of economic loss,\n\nincluding the possibility of lost business opportunities.                       United\n\nStates v. Bucci, 839 F.2d 825, 827-28 (1st Cir. 1988); see also\n\n\n       7\n       Although Cruzado failed to move the court for judgment of\nacquittal on count 12, the jury ultimately acquitted him of that\ncharge.\n       8\n       In 1946, Congress passed the Hobbs Act to amend the 1934\nAnti-Racketeering Act. See Act of July 3, 1946, ch. 537, § 1(c),\n60 Stat. 420. Rep. Hobbs introduced the bill that became law.\n\n                                         -21-\n\fUnited States v. Hathaway, 534 F.2d 386, 396 (1st Cir. 1976).          The\n\ngovernment must \"show that the victim believed that economic loss\n\nwould result from his or her failure to comply with the alleged\n\nextortionist's terms, and that the circumstances . . . rendered\n\nthat fear reasonable.\"      Bucci, 839 F.2d at 828; see also United\n\nStates v. Rivera Rangel, 396 F.3d 476, 483 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nAlternatively, to prove extortion under color of official right,\n\n\"the Government need only show that a public official has obtained\n\na payment to which he was not entitled, knowing that the payment\n\nwas made in return for official acts.\"       Evans v. United States, 504\n\nU.S. 255, 268 (1992).\n\n          a.   Extortion of Cristalería (Count 2)\n\n          Count 2 charged that on April 5, 2001, Cruzado extorted\n\nmoney from Cuevas, Cristalería’s owner, by asking him to inflate\n\nhis price quote by $2,000 for work that he was doing at city hall.\n\nAfter Cuevas was paid twice for the same work (one payment from the\n\nmunicipality’s trust account, one from the city’s regular checking\n\naccount), Cuevas paid Cruzado $4,000.\n\n          Cruzado first stresses that the only evidence as to\n\nCruzado’s reason for requesting an extra $2,000 was Cuevas’s\n\ntestimony, which he assails as “speculative.” Next, he claims that\n\nCuevas never gave him the money.            Finally, Cruzado makes the\n\ncurious   argument   that   what   really    happened   was   theft,   not\n\nextortion, because the money did not truly belong to Cuevas but to\n\n\n                                   -22-\n\fthe municipality: “In order for there to be extortion the money\n\nmust have belonged to Mr. Cuevas.          However, the money they shared\n\nbelonged to the municipality.”\n\n          Cruzado’s    first      two    arguments      reduce   to   a   simple\n\ncredibility dispute: Cuevas’s account supports the conviction,\n\nwhile Cruzado’s does not.        Appellate courts, however, are wisely\n\nreluctant to “second-guess” a jury’s credibility determination.\n\nUnited States v. Carroll, 105 F.3d 740, 743 (1st Cir. 1997); see\n\nalso United States v. Laboy-Delgado, 84 F.3d 22, 27 (1st Cir.\n\n1996). In the context of a sufficiency challenge, moreover, we are\n\nbound to “resolve all credibility disputes in the verdict's favor.\"\n\nTaylor, 54 F.3d at 974.          A reasonable jury could have rejected\n\nCruzado’s self-serving testimony, finding instead that Cuevas was\n\ntelling the truth.\n\n          Cruzado’s third argument -- that the money was not\n\nlegitimately Cuevas’s to begin with -– also fails.                The statute\n\ndoes not require that a victim of extortion part with his own\n\nproperty. Indeed, \"a defendant's claim of right to the property is\n\nirrelevant.   One     may   be   found    guilty   of    extortion    even   for\n\nobtaining one's own property.\"          United States v. Sturman, 49 F.3d\n\n1275, 1284 (7th Cir. 1995).       To be sure, the rightful owner of the\n\n$4,000 was the municipality, not Cuevas; it was paying for work\n\nthat it had not received.         Still, a reasonable jury could have\n\nfound beyond a reasonable doubt that the mayor induced Cuevas to\n\n\n                                    -23-\n\fpart with the money when Cuevas had actual possession over the\n\nproperty -- actual possession being \"the state of immediate,\n\nhands-on physical possession.\"         United States v. Zavala Maldonado,\n\n23 F.3d 4, 6 (1st Cir. 1994).          Cuevas had deposited one of Vega\n\nAlta’s checks into his bank account and had cashed the other; it\n\nwas solely because of the mayor’s actions that he relinquished\n\ncontrol over that money.\n\n           b. Attempted extortion of Premier Electrical (Count 13)\n\n           Premier Electrical’s owner, Marrero, had contracted with\n\nthe municipality to build an indoor basketball court.               Cruzado\n\nasked him for $10,000, supposedly on behalf of the Puerto Rico Day\n\nParade    Committee,    which   was     having   unspecified    “problems.”\n\nUltimately, Marrero gave the mayor a check payable to “cash” but\n\nwas able to stop payment after Cruzado was arrested.\n\n           Cruzado     argues   that   he   requested   the   $10,000   as   a\n\npolitical donation to Centro Cultural, “an entity controlled by his\n\nparty.”    He thereby tries to use the requirement that a specific\n\nquid pro quo is necessary for conviction under the Hobbs Act when\n\nan official receives a political contribution.           See McCormick v.\n\nUnited States, 500 U.S. 257, 273 (1991) (official is guilty of\n\nextortion \"if the payments are made in return for an explicit\n\npromise or undertaking by the official to perform or not to perform\n\nan official act\").      Here, Cruzado avers that he promised nothing\n\nspecific in return for accepting the “contribution,” and that\n\n\n                                   -24-\n\ftherefore a reasonable jury could not have found him guilty.\n\n          This argument leads nowhere.           Although Cruzado asserts\n\nthat the payment was a political contribution, he does not point to\n\nany evidence showing that Centro Cultural was a political body or\n\nhad anything to do with his political campaign.           In fact, Centro\n\nCultural was not under the control of Cruzado’s political party or\n\nof any political party.          While the committee had a number of\n\ngovernmental representatives on it, there was no testimony that\n\nthey   were   members   of   a    particular     party.    Moreover,   the\n\ngovernmental representatives were outnumbered on the committee by\n\nmembers of other cultural groups, which belies the idea that the\n\ncommittee was “controlled” by Cruzado’s party.\n\n          Finally,      according    to    the    testimony   of   Premier\n\nElectrical’s owner, Cruzado requested in the end that the check be\n\nmade out to “cash,” not “Centro Cultural.” A reasonable jury could\n\nhave inferred that Cruzado intended not to use the money for\n\nanything related to the committee’s activities (especially because\n\nthe committee was formed specifically for the Puerto Rico Day\n\nParade, then more than three months in the past), and that Cruzado\n\nintended to cash the check and take the money for himself.             The\n\njury could have further inferred from Marrero's testimony that, if\n\nhe did not pay Cruzado, the mayor would use his official power to\n\npunish Marrero in the future by withholding city business.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -25-\n\f            c. Extortion of Mundo Construction (Count 14)\n\n            Like Cristalería, Mundo Construction was a prospective\n\ncontractor with the municipality.       Its owner, Vargas, knew Cruzado\n\nfrom his check-cashing business and had donated free supplies to\n\nhis political campaign.        As he did with Cristalería’s owner,\n\nCruzado asked Vargas to pad his price quote with an extra $2,000,\n\nwithout    explaining   the   purpose   of   the   extra   money.   Vargas\n\nunderstood, however, that the money was for the mayor’s private\n\nbenefit.     When Vargas refused to pay, Cruzado suddenly told him\n\nthat there was no money after all            for the project to build\n\nsidewalks, curbs, and drainage.\n\n            Cruzado assails this conviction as being based on sheer\n\nspeculation as to his intent.      It is true that, in this instance,\n\nthe jury did not have the benefit of following the transaction\n\nthrough to completion, with the victim’s checks deposited in the\n\nOnaden account (as with Cristalería).         However, the jury was well\n\nwithin its rights to believe Vargas's testimony and to find that\n\nCruzado canceled the project (which was later built by someone\n\nelse) as a reprisal for Vargas’s refusal to submit to his demands\n\nfor money.\n\n            2.   One count of laundering money\n                  from Cristalería (Count 3)\n\n            Cruzado received two $2,000 checks from Cristaleria: one\n\npayable to “cash,” and one payable to “Onaden, Inc.” His chauffeur\n\ncashed the first at the check-cashing business of Cruzado's son;\n\n                                   -26-\n\fthe second was deposited into Cruzado’s private account.\n\n            To convict Cruzado of this offense, the government had to\n\nprove four elements beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) that Cruzado\n\nknowingly conducted a \"financial transaction,\" (2) that he knew the\n\ntransaction involved funds that were the proceeds of some form of\n\nunlawful activity, (3) that the funds involved were in fact the\n\nproceeds of a \"specified unlawful activity,\" and (4) that Cruzado\n\nengaged in the financial transaction knowing that it was designed\n\nin whole or in part to conceal or disguise the nature, location,\n\nsource, ownership, or control of the proceeds of such unlawful\n\nactivity.     See   U.S.C.    §   1956(a)(1)(B)(i);    United     States   v.\n\nCornier-Ortiz, 361 F.3d 29, 37 (1st Cir. 2004); United States v.\n\nMartínez-Medina, 279 F.3d 105, 115 (1st Cir. 2002).          A conviction\n\nrequires evidence of intent to disguise or conceal the transaction,\n\nwhether from direct evidence, like the defendant’s own statements,\n\nor from circumstantial evidence, like the use of a third party to\n\ndisguise the true owner, or unusual secrecy.         See United States v.\n\nCastro-Lara, 970 F.2d 976, 981 (1st Cir. 1992) (“[C]ircumstantial\n\nevidence,    in   and   of   itself,   is   often   enough   to   ground    a\n\nconviction.”); see also Bourjaily v. United States, 483 U.S. 171,\n\n179-80 (1987) (“[I]ndividual pieces of evidence, insufficient in\n\nthemselves to prove a point, may in cumulation prove it.”).\n\n            Cruzado essentially challenges only the fourth element,\n\nintent to conceal.      In his view, merely depositing his ill-gotten\n\n\n                                    -27-\n\fgains in the account of Oficina Dental Las Colinas, Inc., hardly\n\nsignifies an intent to conceal.   Cruzado was well known all over\n\nVega Alta as the mayor and as a prominent citizen, and, according\n\nto him, no rational jury could conclude that Cruzado was trying to\n\nconceal the source of the money by depositing it in a bank where\n\neveryone knew him and knew his sources of income.\n\n           We are, to say the least, unconvinced by this argument.\n\nCruzado deposited these funds, as he did with the other sums he\n\nacquired, in an account in the name of his then-wife’s former\n\ndental practice, for which he was the only signatory, and which he\n\nfailed to report upon being elected mayor.   No one else knew of the\n\naccount.   Every witness asked about the account testified that he\n\nor she had never heard of “Onaden,” but assumed that it was\n\nlegitimate on the mayor’s authority.     A reasonable jury could\n\neasily have concluded that Cruzado intended to conceal the money\n\nthere and use it for his own private purposes.     We see no “clear\n\nand gross injustice” in this conviction.     Hadfield, 918 F.2d at\n\n996.\n\n                B. Cruzado's preserved challenges\n\n           1.   One count of embezzlement or theft of more than\n           $5,000 from Vega Alta (count 1)\n\n           To convict Cruzado on this count, the government had to\n\nprove three elements beyond a reasonable doubt: (i) that Cruzado\n\nwas “an agent of an organization, or of a State, local, or Indian\n\ntribal government, or any agency thereof;” (ii) that Cruzado\n\n                               -28-\n\fembezzled, stole, obtained by fraud, or converted or intentionally\n\nmisapplied    property    “valued     at     $5,000      or    more”   from    “such\n\norganization,     government,    or    agency;”          and   (iii)    that    such\n\n“organization, government, or agency receives, in any one year\n\nperiod [federal funds] in excess of $10,000.”                  18 U.S.C. § 666(a)\n\nand (b).    Theft can be committed in a variety of ways under § 666.\n\n“The first four prohibitions cover any possibility of taking money\n\nfor one’s own use or benefit. Intentional misapplication, in order\n\nto avoid redundancy, must mean intentional misapplication for\n\notherwise    legitimate    purposes;       if     it   were     for    illegitimate\n\npurposes,    it   would   be   covered       by    the    prohibitions        against\n\nembezzlement, stealing, obtaining by fraud, or conversion.\" United\n\nStates v. Urlacher, 979 F.2d 935, 938 (2d Cir. 1992) (quoted in\n\nUnited States v. Cornier-Ortiz, 361 F.3d 29, 36-37 (1st Cir.\n\n2004)).     The total value of funds stolen can be aggregated to\n\nsatisfy the $5,000 minimum that triggers criminal liability under\n\n§ 666.     United States v. Sanderson, 966 F.2d 184, 189 (6th Cir.\n\n1992).\n\n            Cruzado concedes on appeal that he was an agent of a\n\nlocal government -- namely, the mayor of Vega Alta -- which\n\nreceived $10,000 or more in federal funds within a one-year period.\n\nHe maintains, however, that the government failed to present\n\nsufficient evidence to allow a reasonable jury to conclude that he\n\nembezzled or stole more than $5,000 from Vega Alta.                           Without\n\n\n                                      -29-\n\fexplanation,    Cruzado    limits   his    possible   wrongdoing   to    two\n\ntransactions: (1) Centro Cultural’s $4,165 check to Onaden, which\n\nCruzado wrote while in New York at the Puerto Rico Day Parade; and\n\n(2) the $1,756 check made out to “cash,” which he obtained from\n\nEbanistería    Familia’s   owner,   Colón,   and   which   represented    an\n\noverpayment from Vega Alta for work that Colón had not done.\n\n          Cruzado argues that, first, he spent the $4,165 on\n\nexpenses related to the trip to New York.             Even if he had not,\n\nhowever, the money belonged not to the municipality but to the\n\nparade committee, which had received it from Vega Alta with “no\n\nstrings attached.”    Therefore, if Cruzado stole any money, he did\n\nso from the committee, not Vega Alta.         Second, Cruzado maintains\n\nthat Colón owed him the $1,756 as interest on the money that Colón\n\nhad borrowed from him as an advance.           As noted, after Cruzado\n\nclaimed that the municipality would not pay a deposit on Colón’s\n\nnewly contracted job (as Colón’s other customers did), the mayor\n\noffered to provide a loan from his son's check-cashing business, El\n\nCajero Expresso.    Cruzado, in his words, “might be guilty of being\n\na smart businessman and/or a usurer, but he was not being accused\n\nof usury.”\n\n          The facts, when viewed in the light most favorable to the\n\ngovernment, easily support Cruzado’s conviction on this count.\n\nFirst of all, as the government points out, Cruzado neglects to\n\nconsider other incidents besides the two he cites as possibilities.\n\n\n                                    -30-\n\fFor example, there was the $4,000 that he instructed Cristalería’s\n\nowner to skim from Vega Alta’s double payment to him (one payment\n\nfrom Vega Alta’s trust account, and one from its regular checking\n\naccount). While arguing against the extortion conviction vis-à-vis\n\nCristalería,   Cruzado   himself   virtually   concedes    the   theft   by\n\nwriting, “Clearly, the evidence of what occurred on April 5th,\n\n2001, the time period when the crime occurred, points to theft of\n\nMunicipal funds, not extortion.”      In addition, there were two more\n\npayments related to the trip to New York; in both cases, Cruzado\n\nintercepted reimbursements from Sidney Travel that were intended\n\nfor the committee (and, ultimately, the municipality) and deposited\n\nthem in his own bank account.        Those two payments amounted to\n\n$13,991.54.\n\n          Even considering the two payments alone that Cruzado\n\ncites, a reasonable jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt\n\nthat Cruzado took them for his own private gain.          First, there is\n\nno evidence that Cruzado spent the $4,165 while in New York; to the\n\ncontrary, that check was deposited into the Onaden account on July\n\n3, several weeks after the trip had ended.        Cruzado produced no\n\nreceipts for the supposed expenditures.\n\n          His attempt to avoid the conviction by disputing that the\n\nmunicipality was the victim also fails. The parade committee, with\n\nCruzado as its chairman, had agreed that any remaining funds would\n\nbe given to the municipality.      Furthermore, Vega Alta required an\n\n\n                                   -31-\n\faccounting of the funds received by the committee.                 A reasonable\n\njury could have found that, by taking the $4,165, Cruzado was\n\nintercepting the money from being ultimately reimbursed to the\n\nmunicipality and such an interception constituted theft under §\n\n666.\n\n            A reasonable jury could also have disbelieved Cruzado’s\n\nargument that the $1,756 that Cruzado took from Colón, Ebanistería\n\nFamilia’s owner, represented interest on a loan.               Cruzado had no\n\nevidence for this interpretation besides his own self-serving\n\ntestimony, while Colón testified that Cruzado had specifically\n\nrequested    that   he   receive   the   excess     funds   from   Vega   Alta’s\n\npayment.    Believing Cruzado’s explanation would require a perfect\n\ncoincidence between, on the one hand, the amount that Colón owed\n\nCruzado in interest and, on the other, Vega Alta’s overpayment to\n\nColón.     The jury could reasonably reject such an argument that\n\n“would elevate coincidence to an art form.”           Lara, 181 F.3d at 201.\n\n            2. Two counts of extortion\n\n            a.   Extortion of Sidney Travel (Count 4)\n\n            Cruzado twice intercepted refunds that Sidney Travel owed\n\nto   the   committee     (and,   ultimately,   to    the    municipality)   and\n\ndeposited them in his private bank account.                 First, on May 25,\n\n2001, he went to Sidney Travel and told its owner, Alonso, that\n\ninstead of issuing a check to the committee, she should issue a\n\ncheck payable to Onaden, which he claimed to need for food money\n\n\n                                     -32-\n\ffor children who were traveling to New York.              Alonso complied,\n\nissuing the check to a payee she had never heard of, in large part\n\nbecause of Cruzado’s authority as the mayor.            Second, on July 6,\n\n2001, Cruzado again instructed Alonso to issue a check payable to\n\nOnaden, which he deposited in his private account.              She complied\n\nagain, largely for the same reasons.\n\n          Cruzado   claims   that    he    was   not   acting   as   a   public\n\nofficial but only as the chairman of a non-profit organization\n\nwhich was unaffiliated with the municipality.            Hence, the “under\n\ncolor of public office” element of extortion does not apply.\n\nCruzado also argues that the money was due to the committee as a\n\nrefund anyway.   Cruzado was the authorized representative for the\n\ncommittee; Alonso knew that.    Therefore, a rational jury could not\n\nconclude that    Cruzado   induced    her   to   part   with    property    for\n\nunlawful reasons, when he was merely asking her for a refund under\n\nthe authority that he had.           Finally, Cruzado argues that he\n\nreturned the money as soon as he could (which happened to be soon\n\nafter the government opened its investigation); he notes that there\n\nwas no deadline to return the money, and he should not be punished\n\nfor the government’s unexpectedly hasty actions.\n\n          These are specious arguments.           First, Cruzado did not\n\ndivest himself of his authority as mayor when he walked in the door\n\nof Sidney Travel, especially when his mission on behalf of the\n\nparade committee was so closely tied to the municipality itself;\n\n\n                                    -33-\n\fCruzado was chairman because he was the mayor, the committee had\n\nseveral other government officials as members, and the committee’s\n\nentire reason for being was the celebration of the municipality’s\n\n225th anniversary.         A reasonable jury could have believed that\n\nCruzado knew that his authority would allow him to obtain the\n\nrefunds from Alonso, in return for his continued good graces and\n\nfuture business from the municipality.\n\n             Cruzado’s other two arguments are easily dispatched. His\n\nargument that the money was owed to the committee anyway is simply\n\nquestion-begging.      Of course the money was owed to the committee.\n\nCruzado’s criminal conduct relates to what happened to that money\n\nbefore it could get to the committee.       Finally, Cruzado’s argument\n\nthat he returned the money (a point which he repeated throughout\n\ntrial and on appeal) is little more than an implicit admission of\n\nguilt and a plea for leniency.         The jury was entitled to accord\n\nlittle if any weight to such eleventh-hour maneuvers.\n\n             In   short,   Cruzado’s   mishmash   of   allegedly   innocent\n\nmistakes and neutral explanations fails to convince us that a\n\nreasonable jury could not have found Cruzado guilty of extorting\n\nmoney from Sidney Travel.\n\n             b. Extortion of Vega Alta Medical Hospital (Count 6)\n\n             On July 10, 2001, after Cruzado had arrived at the CDT\n\nasking for money, Dr. Rivera gave the mayor a $5,000 check payable\n\nto Onaden.    Dr. Rivera testified that he understood the payment to\n\n\n                                    -34-\n\fbe for the air conditioner that had been installed in the CDT’s\n\ndentistry office (at Cruzado’s instruction), even though that air\n\nconditioner   had   by   then   been   removed   (again,   at   Cruzado’s\n\ninstruction).   Dr. González, meanwhile, had earlier promised to\n\ngive the mayor a $5,000 political contribution; he testified that\n\nhe understood the July 10 payment to be for that purpose.\n\n          Cruzado repeats here his argument that what looks like\n\nextortion was in fact only a political contribution.        To sustain a\n\nconviction under the Hobbs Act for political contributions, he\n\nstresses, requires showing that the public official promised a\n\nspecific quid pro quo, see McCormick, 500 U.S. at 274, and he did\n\nnot promise anything. In support of his argument, he describes the\n\ntwo doctors’ testimony as contradictory, resolving that supposed\n\ncontradiction in favor of Dr. González’s professed understanding\n\nthat the $5,000 payment was a political contribution.             Cruzado\n\nargues that Dr. Rivera would not have paid for an air conditioner\n\non July 10 which had already been removed by June 14.       In Cruzado’s\n\nview, then, Dr. Rivera testified untruthfully, and the $5,000 check\n\nmust have been a political contribution as testified to by the\n\nperson who authorized the check, Dr. González.\n\n          A reasonable jury could have found beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt that, despite the past discussion between the mayor and Dr.\n\nGonzález of a political contribution, Cruzado asked for a check\n\nmade out to “Onaden” so that he could deposit the check in his own\n\n\n                                  -35-\n\fprivate bank account, and the doctors were too scared to refuse\n\nhim.   After all, they both testified to their critical dependence\n\non the municipality for ambulance service.        The jury could have\n\nfurther concluded that the sham invoice given to Dr. Rivera served\n\nto cover the illegal conduct initiated by Cruzado.     The mystery of\n\npaying for an air conditioner that had already been removed from\n\nthe CDT's premises only further buttresses such an inference.     And\n\nCruzado never explains what connection Onaden might have had to\n\nCruzado’s Popular Democratic Party, or why he gave Dr. Rivera an\n\ninvoice for air-conditioning work in exchange for a political\n\ncontribution.\n\n           3.   Four counts of laundering money\n\n           Cruzado was convicted of laundering money derived from\n\nillegal transactions involving Sidney Travel (counts 5 and 8),\n\nCentro Cultural (count 7), and Vega Alta Medical Hospital (count\n\n9).    Cruzado’s argument here is the same as his argument for the\n\ncount charging him with laundering money from Cristalería: no\n\nrational jury could conclude that Cruzado was trying to conceal the\n\nsource of his money, when he was simply depositing the money in a\n\nbank where everyone knew him and knew his sources of income.\n\n           Our response, too, remains the same.     A reasonable jury\n\ncould easily have concluded that Cruzado was concealing these funds\n\nin the Onaden account, which was unknown to anyone else and for\n\nwhich he was the only signatory.   That is a paradigm case of money\n\n\n                                -36-\n\flaundering, and a reasonable jury was free to so find beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.\n\n           4. One count of tampering with three potential witnesses\n           (Count 11)9\n\n           To convict Cruzado on this count, the government had to\n\nprove beyond a reasonable doubt that he: (i) knowingly (ii) used\n\nintimidation, threatened, corruptly     persuaded another person, or\n\nattempted to do so, or engaged in misleading conduct toward another\n\nperson (iii) with intent to influence testimony (iv) in an official\n\nproceeding.   18 U.S.C. § 1512(b)(1).   Trying to persuade a witness\n\nto give false testimony counts as “corruptly persuading” under §\n\n1512(b).   United States v. Khatami, 280 F.3d 907, 912-13 (9th Cir.\n\n2002) (citing cases).   However, “it is an affirmative defense, as\n\nto which the defendant has the burden of proof by a preponderance\n\nof the evidence, that the conduct consisted solely of lawful\n\nconduct and that the defendant’s sole intention was to encourage,\n\ninduce, or cause the other person to testify truthfully.”        18\n\nU.S.C. § 1512(e) (2005) (formerly subsection (d)).\n\n           The jury found Cruzado guilty of tampering or attempting\n\nto tamper with the testimony of Cuevas (Cristalería's owner) on or\n\n\n\n     9\n       Cruzado erroneously contends that the jury found him guilty\nof tampering with Lilia Alonso Alvarez (Sidney Travel's owner) in\na telephone call on August 4, 2001; Milton Martínez Arroyo (owner\nof Martínez Air Conditioning) in late 2000 or early 2001; and Luis\nA. Vargas López (owner of Mundo Construction, Inc.) in a telephone\ncall on December 9, 2001. The jury found him not guilty as to\nthose incidents.\n\n                               -37-\n\fabout October 9, 2001; Drs. González and Rivera (owners of Vega\n\nAlta Medical Hospital, Inc.) on October 17, 2001; and Marrero\n\n(owner of Premier Electrical) in a telephone call on December 10,\n\n2001.\n\n             Cruzado’s   argument    is   simple:    all    he   did   was   urge\n\nwitnesses to tell the truth, which is not a crime.                 According to\n\nthe witnesses, Cruzado did ask that they tell the truth; however,\n\nhis version of “the truth” that he urged upon them was anything but\n\nthe truth. To Cuevas, Cruzado described the $4,000 as repayment of\n\na loan extended to Cuevas before he became mayor.            At first, Cuevas\n\nmaintained that story in front of the FBI.             He then changed his\n\ntune, admitting that the money was skimmed from the inflated bid he\n\nsubmitted to Vega Alta and the double payment he received in\n\nreturn.      As for the doctors, the jury was entitled to reject\n\nCruzado’s characterization of the $5,000 payment as a political\n\ncontribution, and instead find that the doctors’ need for the\n\nmayor’s good graces induced them to hand over the money.               Even with\n\nrespect to Dr. Rivera’s testimony -- that he believed the money was\n\nfor the air conditioner, as evidenced by the invoice he received\n\n(on Onaden letterhead) -- the jury could have found that Cruzado\n\nwas trying to persuade a witness to testify to something other than\n\nhis   true   beliefs.     Finally,    the   jury    could   have    found    that\n\nCruzado’s repeated calls to Marrero and his continued interest in\n\nMarrero's business affairs, which culminated in Marrero's hiring a\n\n\n                                     -38-\n\flawyer to send a cease-and-desist letter, constituted tampering.\n\n                                    III.\n\n                   A. Choosing the correct guidelines manual\n\n            As a threshold matter, a sentencing court must first\n\ndecide which edition of the sentencing guidelines to use.                    A\n\ndefendant should be sentenced according to the guidelines in effect\n\non the date of sentencing, unless \"the court determines that use of\n\nthe Guidelines Manual in effect on the date that the defendant is\n\nsentenced would violate the ex post facto clause of the United\n\nStates Constitution,” in which case “the court shall use the\n\nGuidelines Manual in effect on the date that the offense of\n\nconviction was committed.\"         USSG § 1B1.11(b)(1).10        Cruzado was\n\nsentenced on November 8, 2002, seven days after the November 1\n\neffective date of the 2002 guidelines.          Nevertheless, the PSR used\n\na two-year-old edition of the guidelines, its only explanation\n\nbeing the flat assertion that the \"2000 edition . . . has been used\n\nin   this   case   to   comply   with   the   provisions   of   Guidelines   §\n\n1B1.11(b)(1).\"      The district court followed the PSR's lead and\n\nsentenced Cruzado under the 2000 edition of the guidelines.\n\n            The PSR and the district court made a mistake, however,\n\n\n\n      10\n       The Constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws,\nU.S. Const., art. I, § 9, cl. 3, requires that a defendant be\nsentenced under the guidelines in effect when he committed the\noffense, rather than those in effect at time of sentencing, where\nsubsequent amendments would have increased his punishment.    See\nUnited States v. Colón-Muñoz, 318 F.3d 348, 361 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n                                    -39-\n\fbecause Cruzado’s last offense of conviction occurred on December\n\n10, 2001, thereby making the 2001 guidelines –- not 2000 –- the\n\nrelevant comparison with the 2002 guidelines for ex post facto\n\npurposes.   Even in a complex case like this one, involving conduct\n\nthat occurred on dates implicating different versions of the\n\nmanual, \"it will not be necessary to compare more than two manuals\n\nto determine the applicable guideline range -- the manual in effect\n\nat the time the last offense of conviction was completed and the\n\nmanual in effect at the time of sentencing.\"            Id. § 1B1.11, cmt.\n\nbackground (emphasis added).\n\n            Count    11   charged   Cruzado   with,   among   other   things,\n\nunlawful conduct on December 10, 2001 -- tampering with the owner\n\nof Premier Electrical.        Cruzado was convicted of that offense.\n\nDecember 10, 2001, was more than a month after the effective date\n\nof the guidelines' 2001 edition.        Therefore, the comparison for ex\n\npost facto purposes is between the 2002 edition and the 2001\n\nedition.    As it turns out, the relevant sentencing guidelines did\n\nnot change between those two years.           Therefore, Cruzado is right\n\nthat he should have been sentenced under the 2002 guidelines, and\n\nthe court, misled by the PSR, plainly erred in applying the 2000\n\nguidelines.\n\n                    B. Reasons for remanding\n\n            Arguably, we could continue our analysis to see if\n\nCruzado was prejudiced by the application of the 2000 guidelines.\n\n\n                                     -40-\n\fSee United States v. Sedoma, 332 F.3d 20, 28 (1st Cir. 2003)\n\n(reviewing a sentence for plain error). That analysis might reveal\n\nthat a sentence under the 2002 guidelines would involve the same\n\nguidelines range as the 2000 guidelines.         On the other hand,\n\nCruzado argues that he would receive a lower sentence under the\n\n2002 guidelines, while the government and the district court\n\nbelieve that he would receive a higher sentence.     For two reasons,\n\nhowever, we decline to undertake such an analysis here.\n\n           First, between the 2000 and 2002 editions, the sentencing\n\ncommission introduced a major change in the way that sentences for\n\nmoney laundering are calculated.       The 2000 guidelines simply gave\n\na fixed number as the base offense level for money laundering.   The\n\n2002 guidelines take a more complicated approach by incorporating\n\nthe offense level of the underlying offense.11      Sentencing under\n\nthat new regime might involve factual disputes or legal issues\n\nwhich the district court has not yet had an opportunity to address.\n\nIf we were to explore this uncharted territory ourselves, we, in\n\neffect, would be doing the sentencing rather than the district\n\ncourt.    That is not an appropriate allocation of functions.     See\n\nKoon v. United States, 518 U.S. 81, 98 (1996) (\"District courts\n\nhave an institutional advantage over appellate courts\" in some\n\n\n     11\n       The laundering guideline says to use the \"offense level for\nthe underlying offense from which the laundered funds were derived,\nif (A) the defendant committed the underlying offense . . . ; and\n(B) the offense level for that offense can be determined.\" USSG §\n2S1.1(a)(1). Both conditions are true for Cruzado.\n\n                                -41-\n\fsentencing matters.); United States v. Rivera, 994 F.2d 942, 950\n\n(1st Cir. 1993) (Breyer, C.J.) (referring to district courts'\n\n\"institutional strength\" as being able to \"best understand the\n\nrelation of the Guidelines to case-specific, detailed facts\").\n\n           Second, after United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. __, 125\n\nS. Ct. 738 (2005), the sentencing guidelines are now advisory\n\nrather than mandatory.     See also United States v. Antonakopoulos,\n\n399 F.3d 68 (1st Cir. 2005).     That legal development injects even\n\nmore uncertainty into an attempt by us to reconstruct a sentencing\n\ndecision   by   the   district   court   under   the   2002   guidelines.\n\nTherefore, we conclude that the most prudent course is to vacate\n\nthe sentence and remand for resentencing under the correct edition\n\nof the guidelines.\n\n                                   IV.\n\n           We AFFIRM Cruzado’s convictions.        We VACATE Cruzado’s\n\nsentence and REMAND for further proceedings not inconsistent with\n\nthis opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -42-\n\f                                     Appendix\n\n                   Embezzlement &    Extortion       Laundering 12    Tampering\n                        Theft\n\n  Count 1: 18      Between Mar.\n    U.S.C. §       2001 & Jan.\n666(a)(1)(A)       25, 2002:\n                   stole more\n   (i) and         than $5,000\n(a)(1)(A)(ii)      from Vega\n                   Alta.\n\n Count 2: id. §                     April 5,\n    1951(a)                         2001: $4,000\n                                    from\n                                    Cristalería\n\n   Count 3: id.

On January 25, 2002, a federal grand jury returned a superseding indictment that charged him with a number of crimes tied to abuse of his public office, including extortion, embezzlement, theft, money laundering, and witness tampering. After a fourteen-day trial, Cruzado was convicted of the following charges: one count of embezzlement from a program receiving federal funds, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 666(a)(1)(A)(i) and (a)(1)(A)(ii); five counts of extortion, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1951(a); five counts of money laundering, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1956(a)(1)(B)(i) and (a)(1)(B)(ii); and one count of tampering with witnesses, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1512(b)(1) and (b)(2). The district court sentenced Cruzado to 63 months' imprisonment on all counts except for the witness tampering, for which Cruzado received 12 months. The sentences were to run concurrently with each other. In this appeal, Cruzado challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his counts of conviction. He also argues that his sentence was erroneously calculated. Although we affirm the convictions, we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first provide a brief overview of the case, taking our information from the record as viewed in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict. <i>See United States v. Lara,</i> 181 F.3d 183, 190 (1st Cir.1999). We reserve a fuller discussion of the facts for later sections to which they are particularly relevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After graduating from the University of Puerto Rico in 1969, Cruzado taught advanced mathematics at a local high school until 1976. At that point, he moved into the construction business. In 1992, he went into business with his then-wife, a pediatric dentist, who opened a medical practice, incorporated as Oficina Dental Las Colinas, Inc., often referred to by its acronym, Onaden, Inc. From 1992 to 1995, Cruzado handled routine administrative tasks for Onaden, including the opening of a bank account at a local branch of Banco Popular, which would later prove useful to his criminal endeavors. The account, in the name of Oficina Dental Las Colinas, Inc., with Cruzado as the only signatory, was used for such items as lease payments. When Cruzado became mayor, however, he did not disclose the account's existence as required by the Ethics Office for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From 1996 to 2000, Cruzado ran a check-cashing business, El Cajero Expresso. In November 2000, Cruzado was elected mayor of Vega Alta &#8212; his first try at running for public office &#8212; as a member of the Popular Democratic Party and was duly sworn into office on January 8, 2001. Upon his election, Cruzado appears to have sold the check-cashing business to his oldest son, who took over day-to-day control. Cruzado, however, retained the last word in business affairs and kept control over the business's checking account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Within a scant few weeks of becoming mayor, Cruzado began using his official position to embezzle and extort thousands of dollars from the municipality and from contractors who were working for the municipality; he then laundered the money in the Onaden bank account. We now describe the particulars of his criminal activity. (See the chart, attached as an appendix, for a summary of the charges and parties involved.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Cristaler&#237;a Vega Alta, Inc.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cristaler&#237;a Vega Alta is a firm that installs and repairs glass and aluminum doors. Cristaler&#237;a's owner, Juan Cuevas Rodr&#237;guez, first got to know Cruzado through Cristaler&#237;a's glass work for Cruzado's construction business. Shortly after Cruzado took office in January 2001, he embarked on an extensive program to renovate Vega Alta's city hall, which was in poor shape. Cruzado requested that Cristaler&#237;a perform some locksmithing and remodeling work on the building, and he asked Cuevas for a price estimate. Cuevas quoted a price of $5,814. Cruzado then told Cuevas to add $2,000 to his quote and give the extra money to him. Fearing that he might be cut off from future work if he disobeyed, Cuevas obliged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cristaler&#237;a's contract provided that the company would be paid from a trust account of the municipality at Banco Santander, whose funds were reserved for making improvements to the city hall. For some reason, there was a delay in the disbursement of those funds. Cruzado spoke to Vega Alta's director of finance, Damien O. Col&#243;n Pab&#243;n, telling him that Cristaler&#237;a was getting impatient about the delay and asking whether the municipality could expedite payment. Col&#243;n told Cruzado that the municipality's regular checking account might be faster, although disbursing funds from that account would require additional paperwork: price quotes, invoices, and various other papers. Also, when Banco Santander eventually made the disbursement from the trust account, that money would have to be put into the municipality's checking account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cruzado then informed Cuevas that, to be paid, he would need to procure some other, competing bids that were higher than Cristaler&#237;a's. Cuevas complied: he approached two competing glass shops and told them to prepare fake bids that were higher than Cristaler&#237;a's quote. They agreed to do so, even though they had no intention of submitting a formal bid for the work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 4, 2001, the check from the trust account to pay Cristaler&#237;a for its work was delivered to Cruzado's office. Colon requested that the mayor deposit the check into the municipality's checking account. The mayor responded that Cristaler&#237;a would be working for the municipality in the future, and that the check would be used to pay for that work. Colon criticized that plan, reaffirming that the check should go into Vega Alta's checking account and that, if Cristaler&#237;a needed to be paid for new work, then a new contract should be drawn up and the disbursements could be made on that basis. Cruzado assured Colon that those formalities were not necessary; he would be responsible for retaining the check and making payments to Cristaler&#237;a.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cristaler&#237;a was then paid twice for its work, receiving checks from both of Vega Alta's bank accounts. Specifically, on March 23, 2001, Cuevas picked up a check from city hall, drawn on the municipality's regular checking account, for the inflated price of $8,549 (minus a certain sum that Cuevas owed the municipality in licensing fees). Cuevas deposited that check in Cristaler&#237;a's bank account. Then, on April 4, 2001, Cuevas received a visit in his office from Cruzado, who came bearing another check, this one also for $8,549 (again, minus certain immaterial deductions) drawn from the trust account. Cruzado told Cuevas to take the check, explaining that Cristaler&#237;a would earn the double payment by doing more jobs for Vega Alta in the future. The next day, April 5, 2001, Cuevas issued two checks drawn on Cristaler&#237;a's account, each for $2,000: one made out to \"cash,\" and one made out to \"Onaden, Inc.,\" according to Cruzado's instructions. Cruzado's chauffeur cashed the first check at the check-cashing business of Cruzado's son and gave Cruzado the money, while Cruzado deposited the second check into the Onaden account at Banco Popular.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early October 2001, Cruzado asked to meet with Cuevas, telling him he had something important to discuss. He claimed that he was being audited, and that he was nervous about the $2,000 check that Cuevas had issued to Onaden, Inc. Cruzado told Cuevas that, if asked about the check, he should say that it was a repayment of a loan extended to him by Cruzado before becoming mayor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Sidney Travel and Tours, Inc.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 2001, Vega Alta was celebrating its 225th anniversary and, at Cruzado's request, the organizers of the annual Puerto Rico Day Parade in New York were going to dedicate that year's parade to the town. As mayor, Cruzado formed a committee, called the Puerto Rico Day Parade Committee, to raise money and arrange for Vega Alta's delegation to travel to New York for the June parade. The committee, which was composed of governmental employees and representatives from local cultural groups, opened a checking account under the name \"Centro Cultural de Vega Alta,\" which had two signatories, neither of whom was Cruzado. The Committee chose a local travel agency, Sidney Travel and Tours, to arrange for airplane tickets, ground transportation, and hotels. Cruzado was the only member of the committee who was handling lodging and hotel accommodations. Sidney Travel's owner, Lilia Alonso Alvarez, had numerous contacts over the next few months with the committee while planning the trip to New York. Between April and June 2001, the committee raised about $160,000: $40,000 given by the municipality's assembly, the rest through private donations. Any money not needed for the trip was to be refunded to the municipality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The committee put down an initial deposit with Sidney Travel to secure plane and hotel reservations. As the date of the parade neared and the travel arrangements assumed their final form, Alonso calculated that (1) the committee owed Sidney Travel $67,240.90; and (2) Sidney Travel owed the committee a refund of $14,816.74, which could be offset against the larger amount. Alonso informed the committee of her tally. On May 25, 2001, Cruzado arrived at Sidney Travel for a financial reckoning, bearing a blank check from Centro Cultural's account. He was alone. Instead of allowing Alonso to credit the entire $14,816.74 to the committee's account, Cruzado told her that he wanted part of the credit as a separate payment, which would be useful to him as food money for children who would be attending the parade. So instructed, Alonso made out a check for $5,816.74 to Onaden, Inc., and credited the remaining $9,000 to the committee's balance. The mayor then paid off the balance with a Centro Cultural check for $58,240.90. He later deposited the Onaden check into his private account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In New York, Cruzado stayed at the Grand Hyatt Hotel, while most of Vega Alta's other parade attendees stayed at the Marriot Marquis. On June 11, 2001, the day after the parade, Cruzado sent a messenger to speak to Marilyn Garc&#237;a, who served as one of the two signatories on Centro Cultural checks. Cruzado's message: he wanted three signed, blank checks drawn on the Centro Cultural account. Garc&#237;a handed over the checks. Cruzado made out the first two checks to the Grand Hyatt; the third, he made out to Onaden, Inc., in the amount of $4,164. On July 3, 2001, that check was deposited in the Onaden account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 6, 2001, after the trip was over, Sidney Travel made a final accounting. Again, a refund was due to the committee. Cruzado went to Sidney Travel himself and instructed Alonso to issue a check in the name of Onaden, Inc., for $8,174.80. Later, that check was deposited into Onaden's account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 3, 2001, the Federal Bureau of Investigation spoke to Alonso about Cruzado's role in the committee's travel preparations. The next day, she informed Cruzado of the FBI's interest in his dealings. Cruzado then made out an Onaden check for $13,991.54 (the total of Sidney Travel's May 25 and July 6 checks to Onaden), dated it July 7, 2001, and deposited it into the Centro Cultural account on August 13, 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Vega Alta Medical Hospital, Inc.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like city hall, Vega Alta's local health clinic, the Centro de Diagn&#243;stico y Tratamiento (CDT), needed renovations. Located throughout Puerto Rico, CDTs provide basic health care to local populations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Shortly before the events of this case, Puerto Rico had privatized many CDTs. Vega Alta's CDT had been purchased by a partnership formed by two doctors: Luis Gonz&#225;lez Berm&#250;dez and Emilio Rivera Costas. The partnership was named Vega Alta Medical Hospital, Inc. The partners divided their responsibilities: Dr. Gonz&#225;lez was the medical director, while Dr. Rivera was the administrator, handling tasks relating to maintenance, repair, and management. The partners had agreed with the municipality (although not in a written contract) that Vega Alta would provide two services &#8212; ambulance service, crucial to the CDT's functioning, as well as groundskeeping. Vega Alta had also agreed to donate an old, unused mobile health vehicle, which the CDT could repair and then use to provide health care to rural and outlying areas. Dr. Gonz&#225;lez testified that the municipality was in charge of maintaining and fixing the CDT's physical facilities, as directed by Dr. Rivera.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vega Alta's CDT also lacked air conditioning in the emergency room and administrative offices, a violation of Puerto Rico's health code. The doctors had been soliciting quotes from several air-conditioning businesses to remedy the problem. In January 2001, Cruzado visited the CDT for the first time, where he met with Dr. Rivera, who explained to him some of their problems. Cruzado said that he would send over a company, Martinez Air Conditioning, who had done some work for the municipality in the past, and that Dr. Rivera need not continue seeking bids. Cruzado also informed Dr. Rivera that Mart&#237;nez Air Conditioning would install an air-conditioning unit in the CDT's dentistry office, located in a dilapidated and partially abandoned annex to the main building. Dr. Rivera protested that his priority was to get air conditioning for the emergency room, but Cruzado persisted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cruzado subsequently paid the CDT another visit to speak to Dr. Gonz&#225;lez, Dr. Rivera's partner. The two men were alone. Cruzado explained that his political party was trying to raise money through donations. Feeling pressured by the mayor's authority and aware of the CDT's critical need for ambulance service from the municipality, Dr. Gonz&#225;lez told him that he would contribute, even though Dr. Gonz&#225;lez did not belong to the mayor's political party. At the time, however, Dr. Gonz&#225;lez did not give the mayor any money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mart&#237;nez Air Conditioning then arrived on the premises, installed the air conditioner in the dentistry office, and invoiced the CDT for $2,895, which the CDT did not immediately pay. Meanwhile, Mart&#237;nez sent an invoice to the municipality for the same amount, from which he received a check on May 4, 2001. Shortly thereafter, the mayor asked Martinez to remove the air conditioner from the CDT, for reasons known only to himself, and to take it to a nearby police station. Mart&#237;nez did so, and was paid for his trouble with an $850 check from the municipality dated June 14, 2001.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 10, 2001, Cruzado arrived at the CDT and asked for money from Dr. Rivera, who understood the payment to be related to the air conditioner (which, by then, had already been both installed and removed). Dr. Rivera testified that he knew nothing about the political contribution that Cruzado and Dr. Gonz&#225;lez had discussed. Dr. Rivera asked for an invoice; Cruzado left for five or ten minutes and returned with an invoice for $5,000 on letterhead reading \"Onaden, Inc.\" The invoice referred, however, to work performed by Mart&#237;nez Air Conditioning.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Rivera had a blank payroll check available that had already been signed by Dr. Gonz&#225;lez. When Dr. Rivera called Dr. Gonz&#225;lez to inform him of the impending payment, the two partners did not discuss the purpose of the payment. Dr. Rivera merely informed Dr. Gonz&#225;lez that the mayor was there looking for money, and Dr. Gonz&#225;lez said that paying him was fine. According to their testimony, Dr. Rivera understood the payment to be for the air conditioner, and Dr. Gonz&#225;lez understood the payment to be the political contribution that he had discussed with the mayor earlier. Dr. Rivera then handed Cruzado a $5,000 check made out to Onaden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later in October, while being investigated by the FBI, Cruzado spoke to Dr. Rivera. Cruzado told Dr. Rivera to \"tell the truth,\" which, according to Cruzado, was that the payment was a political donation. Dr. Rivera refused, saying that he would maintain that the payment was for the air conditioner, as evidenced by the invoice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Ebanister&#237;a Familia</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ebanister&#237;a Familia is a woodworking shop in Vega Alta owned by Pedro A. Col&#243;n Mu&#241;oz, who knew Cruzado from patronizing his check-cashing business. During his mayoral campaign, Cruzado asked Col&#243;n for wooden poles to support advertising banners, which Col&#243;n provided free of charge. Soon after his election, Cruzado called Col&#243;n to city hall, where he explained that he wanted some glasswork and woodwork done in the lobby of the building, including seven wooden doors and some mahogany cabinets. Col&#243;n took some measurements and quoted a price of $7,500. Cruzado then requested some additional work. On February 12, 2001, Col&#243;n gave Cruzado a written price quote for $9,200, which included the requested extra work. Col&#243;n testified that, typically, he requested a 50 percent deposit from customers before beginning work, which he uses to buy materials. He was told by Cruzado, however, that the municipality did not pay such deposits. Cruzado then offered to lend Col&#243;n the money from his son's check-cashing business. Col&#243;n went to El Cajero Expresso and received $5,200.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Col&#243;n had begun the work, Cruzado told him to reduce the scope of the project, eliminating much of the extra work which would have raised the project cost to $9,200. Col&#243;n complied and eventually installed the woodwork at city hall. On April 4, 2001, Cruzado arrived at Col&#243;n's place of business bearing a $8,556 check ($9,200 minus 7 percent taxes), drawn on the municipality's trust fund at Banco Santander. Evidently, the municipality's payment had not been adjusted downward to account for the reduced work. Cruzado asked Col&#243;n to take the check and give the excess funds back in the form of a check payable to cash. Col&#243;n's wife, a certified public accountant who helped with the family business, later prepared a check payable to herself for $6,956 (the $5,200 loan plus the municipality's $1,756 overpayment), endorsed it, and gave the check to Col&#243;n. Col&#243;n dropped off the check, which was now as good as cash, at the check-cashing business of Cruzado's son. The check was later cashed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">E. Premier Electrical and General Contractors, Inc.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Premier Electrical and General Contractors, Inc. (Premier Electrical), was owned by Juan Marrero Visalden, an electrician. On June 19, 2001, Marrero contracted with Vega Alta (Cruzado signed the contract) to build a local indoor basketball court, which would include cement foundations, bathrooms, a cafeteria, sidewalks, wiring work, and drainage. The base price for the project was $293,000; with some additional items, the total price was $342,000. After signing the contract, Premier Electrical began work in June or July.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cruzado paid occasional visits to the site, observing the work and making casual conversation with Marrero. On one visit in September, Cruzado asked Marrero for a $10,000 payment for the Centro Cultural de Vega Alta. Marrero, who testified that he felt \"rather stunned\" by the request, agreed to pay. When Marrero asked how he could contact Cruzado, the mayor gave Marrero his business card, on which he had written his cell phone number.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 28, 2001, Marrero issued a $10,000 check payable to \"Centro Cultural de Vega Alta,\" drawn on Premier Electrical's account. By coincidence, that same day Cruzado showed up at the project site. When Marrero told him that the check was ready, however, the mayor told him to prepare a different check payable to \"cash.\" The mayor said that he needed the money to take care of some \"problems\" at the Centro Cultural. On October 15, 2001, Marrero followed those instructions, issued the new check, and gave it to the mayor at his office in city hall.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Cruzado was arrested on October 24, Marrero discovered that the check had not been cashed yet. The next day, he ordered his bank to stop payment on it. Later, when Cruzado had posted bond, he paid another visit to the project site. Cruzado asked what Marrero had done with the check. When Marrero told him that he had stopped payment on it, Cruzado told him he had done, in Marrero's words, \"a good job.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later, when Cruzado was no longer mayor, he kept calling Marrero. For example, he informed Marrero that his company had won a bid that it had submitted to Vega Alta for improvements to a local baseball field. Marrero knew that he had won the bid but had yet to receive any official papers confirming that fact. In that conversation, Cruzado also asked him whether he had met with the FBI. When Marrero admitted that he had, Cruzado told him that he would have to call him back. Eventually, Marrero felt compelled to retain an attorney, who sent a letter to Cruzado asking that he stop calling and checking into Marrero's business affairs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">F.

Vargas L&#243;pez, did business under the name Ferreteria Mundo as a construction company and hardware store. Like Colon, the owner of Ebanisteria Familia, Vargas knew Cruzado from using his check-cashing business. Vargas, too, helped with Cruzado's mayoral campaign, setting up platforms for political rallies without charge. In September 2001, Cruzado took Vargas to a neighborhood in Vega Alta, where they discussed a possible construction project involving sidewalks, curbs, and drainage. Cruzado asked for a price quote from Vargas. A few days later, after taking some measurements, Vargas delivered a written estimate of $39,500 to the clerk's office at city hall. Vargas then received a telephone call from the mayor, who asked him to add $2,000 to his quote. Vargas refused, explaining that he was reluctant to pass the $40,000 mark in his bid.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Moreover, Vargas believed that Cruzado wanted the extra money for his private benefit. Consequently, Vargas refused to add $2,000 to his bid, and Cruzado then told him that the project would not be built because of a lack of funds. Cruzado was arrested shortly thereafter, and another contractor later completed most of the work that Cruzado and Vargas had discussed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some time in 2001, the federal government began investigating Cruzado's conduct. During that investigation, Cruzado added to his troubles when he attempted to tamper with potential witnesses, the owners of Cristaler&#237;a and Vega Alta Medical Hospital. The mayor was eventually indicted and arrested on October 24, 2001. Cruzado posted bond on November 2, 2001, and was released, whereupon he tampered with another potential witness, the owner of Premier Electrical.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 25, 2002, the grand jury returned a 14-count superseding indictment, charging Cruzado with the following offenses:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; Count 1: embezzlement, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 666(a)(1)(A)(i) and (a)(1)(A)(ii);</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; Counts 2, 4, 6, 12, 13, &amp; 14: extortion, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1951(a);</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; Counts 3, 5, 7, 8, 9 &amp; 10: money laundering, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1956(a)(1)(B)(i) and 1956(a)(1)(B)(ii);</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; Count 11: tampering with witnesses, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1512(b)(1) and 1512(b)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These counts are listed on the chart attached as an appendix to this opinion, which shows how Cruzado's laundering counts all derive from money that he was charged with embezzling or extorting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial began on May 20, 2002. The government used a combination of testimony from Cruzado's victims and acquaintances, along with documentary evidence of cancelled checks and the like, to build its case. After the government rested on May 28, Cruzado filed a motion for judgment of acquittal on counts 1, 4 through 10, and 11 (thereby declining to challenge counts 2, 3, 12, 13, and 14). That motion was denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his defense, through the cross-examination of government witnesses and his own testimony, Cruzado tried to characterize some payments as political contributions; as for others, he stressed that they had been innocent mistakes and that he had eventually returned the money (he had returned some payments after the government had begun investigating his dealings). He also used character witnesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Cruzado rested his case on June 5, he renewed his motion for judgment of acquittal, which the court granted as to count 10. On June 7, the jury found Cruzado guilty on all remaining counts except count 12, for which it returned a verdict of not guilty. On June 14, Cruzado filed a second motion for judgment of acquittal as to all remaining counts except 2, 3, 13, and 14, which the court denied on July 31, 2002. On November 8, 2002, Cruzado was sentenced to 63 months in prison for Counts 1 through 9, 13, and 14; and 1 year for Count 11, the terms to run concurrently. More than a year later, on November 24, 2003, the district court ordered Cruzado to pay restitution in the amount of $14,251.82 to Vega Alta.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review <i>de novo</i> a district court's denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal under Fed.R.Crim.P. 29.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Our task is to decide \"whether, after assaying all the evidence in the light most amiable to the government, and taking all reasonable inferences in its favor, a rational factfinder could find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the prosecution successfully proved the essential elements of the crime.\" <i>United States v.

The government may satisfy its burden of proof \"by either direct or circumstantial evidence, or by any combination thereof.\" <i>United States v. Gifford,</i> 17 F.3d 462, 467 (1st Cir.1994). Moreover, we must \"resolve all credibility disputes in the verdict's favor.\" <i>United States v. Taylor,</i> 54 F.3d 967, 974 (1st Cir.1995). Ultimately, the court \"need not believe that no verdict other than a guilty verdict could sensibly be reached, but must only satisfy itself that the guilty verdict finds support in a plausible rendition of the record.\" <i>United States v.

He faces an even greater challenge on the counts that he did not so contest: counts 2, 3, 13, and 14. Cruzado's failure to move for judgment of acquittal on those counts means that he must show \"clear and gross injustice\" to prevail now.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> <i>United States v.

Bucci,</i> 839 F.2d 825, 827-28 (1st Cir.1988); <i>see also United States v. Hathaway,</i> 534 F.2d 386, 396 (1st Cir.1976). The government must \"show that the victim believed that economic loss would result from his or her failure to comply with the alleged extortionist's terms, and that the circumstances ... rendered that fear reasonable.\" <i>Bucci,</i> 839 F.2d at 828; <i>see also United States v. Rivera Rangel,</i> 396 F.3d 476, 483 (1st Cir.2005). Alternatively, to prove extortion under color of official right, \"the Government need only show that a public official has obtained a payment to which he was not entitled, knowing that the payment was made in return for official acts.\" <i>Evans v. United States,</i> 504 U.S. 255, 268, 112 S.Ct. 1881, 119 L.Ed.2d 57 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>a. Extortion of Cristaler&#237;a (Count 2)</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Count 2 charged that on April 5, 2001, Cruzado extorted money from Cuevas, Cristaler&#237;a's owner, by asking him to inflate his price quote by $2,000 for work that he was doing at city hall. After Cuevas was paid twice for the same work (one payment from the municipality's trust account, one from the city's regular checking account), Cuevas paid Cruzado $4,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cruzado first stresses that the only evidence as to Cruzado's reason for requesting an extra $2,000 was Cuevas's testimony, which he assails as \"speculative.\" Next, he claims that Cuevas never gave him the money. Finally, Cruzado makes the curious argument that what really happened was theft, not extortion, because the money did not truly belong to Cuevas but to the municipality: \"In order for there to be extortion the money must have belonged to Mr. Cuevas. However, the money they shared belonged to the municipality.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cruzado's first two arguments reduce to a simple credibility dispute: Cuevas's account supports the conviction, while Cruzado's does not. Appellate courts, however, are wisely reluctant to \"second-guess\" a jury's credibility determination. <i>United States v. Carroll,</i> 105 F.3d 740, 743 (1st Cir.1997); <i>see also United States v. Laboy-Delgado,</i> 84 F.3d 22, 27 (1st Cir.1996). In the context of a sufficiency challenge, moreover, we are bound to \"resolve all credibility disputes in the verdict's favor.\" <i>Taylor,</i> 54 F.3d at 974. A reasonable jury could have rejected Cruzado's self-serving testimony, finding instead that Cuevas was telling the truth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cruzado's third argument &#8212; that the money was not legitimately Cuevas's to begin with &#8212; also fails. The statute does not require that a victim of extortion part with his own property. Indeed, \"a defendant's claim of right to the property is irrelevant. One may be found guilty of extortion even for obtaining one's own property.\" <i>United States v. Sturman,</i> 49 F.3d 1275, 1284 (7th Cir.1995). To be sure, the rightful owner of the $4,000 was the municipality, not Cuevas; it was paying for work that it had not received. Still, a reasonable jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the mayor induced Cuevas to part with the money when Cuevas had actual possession over the property &#8212; actual possession being \"the state of immediate, hands-on physical possession.\" <i>United States v. Zavala Maldonado,</i> 23 F.3d 4, 6 (1st Cir.1994). Cuevas had deposited one of Vega Alta's checks into his bank account and had cashed the other; it was solely because of the mayor's actions that he relinquished control over that money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>b. Attempted extortion of Premier Electrical (Count 13)</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Premier Electrical's owner, Marrero, had contracted with the municipality to build an indoor basketball court. Cruzado asked him for $10,000, supposedly on behalf of the Puerto Rico Day Parade Committee, which was having unspecified \"problems.\" Ultimately, Marrero gave the mayor a check payable to \"cash\" but was able to stop payment after Cruzado was arrested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cruzado argues that he requested the $10,000 as a political donation to Centro Cultural, \"an entity controlled by his party.\" He thereby tries to use the requirement that a specific <i>quid pro quo</i> is necessary for conviction under the Hobbs Act when an official receives a political contribution. <i>See McCormick v. United States,</i> 500 U.S. 257, 273, 111 S.Ct. 1807, 114 L.Ed.2d 307 (1991) (official is guilty of extortion \"if the payments are made in return for an explicit promise or undertaking by the official to perform or not to perform an official act\"). Here, Cruzado avers that he promised nothing specific in return for accepting the \"contribution,\" and that therefore a reasonable jury could not have found him guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument leads nowhere. Although Cruzado asserts that the payment was a political contribution, he does not point to any evidence showing that Centro Cultural was a political body or had anything to do with his political campaign. In fact, Centro Cultural was not under the control of Cruzado's political party or of any political party. While the committee had a number of governmental representatives on it, there was no testimony that they were members of a particular party. Moreover, the governmental representatives were outnumbered on the committee by members of other cultural groups, which belies the idea that the committee was \"controlled\" by Cruzado's party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, according to the testimony of Premier Electrical's owner, Cruzado requested in the end that the check be made out to \"cash,\" not \"Centro Cultural.\" A reasonable jury could have inferred that Cruzado intended not to use the money for anything related to the committee's activities (especially because the committee was formed specifically for the Puerto Rico Day Parade, then more than three months in the past), and that Cruzado intended to cash the check and take the money for himself. The jury could have further inferred from Marrero's testimony that, if he did not pay Cruzado, the mayor would use his official power to punish Marrero in the future by withholding city business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>c. Extortion of Mundo Construction (Count 14)</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like Cristaler&#237;a, Mundo Construction was a prospective contractor with the municipality. Its owner, Vargas, knew Cruzado from his check-cashing business and had donated free supplies to his political campaign. As he did with Cristaler&#237;a's owner, Cruzado asked Vargas to pad his price quote with an extra $2,000, without explaining the purpose of the extra money. Vargas understood, however, that the money was for the mayor's private benefit. When Vargas refused to pay, Cruzado suddenly told him that there was no money after all for the project to build sidewalks, curbs, and drainage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cruzado assails this conviction as being based on sheer speculation as to his intent. It is true that, in this instance, the jury did not have the benefit of following the transaction through to completion, with the victim's checks deposited in the Onaden account (as with Cristaler&#237;a). However, the jury was well within its rights to believe Vargas's testimony and to find that Cruzado canceled the project (which was later built by someone else) as a reprisal for Vargas's refusal to submit to his demands for money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>2. One count of laundering money from Cristaler&#237;a (Count 3)</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cruzado received two $2,000 checks from Cristaleria: one payable to \"cash,\" and one payable to \"Onaden, Inc.\" His chauffeur cashed the first at the check-cashing business of Cruzado's son; the second was deposited into Cruzado's private account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To convict Cruzado of this offense, the government had to prove four elements beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) that Cruzado knowingly conducted a \"financial transaction,\" (2) that he knew the transaction involved funds that were the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity, (3) that the funds involved were in fact the proceeds of a \"specified unlawful activity,\" and (4) that Cruzado engaged in the financial transaction knowing that it was designed in whole or in part to conceal or disguise the nature, location, source, ownership, or control of the proceeds of such unlawful activity. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(a)(1)(B)(i); <i>United States v. Cornier-Ortiz,</i> 361 F.3d 29, 37 (1st Cir.2004); <i>United States v. Martinez-Medina,</i> 279 F.3d 105, 115 (1st Cir.2002). A conviction requires evidence of intent to disguise or conceal the transaction, whether from direct evidence, like the defendant's own statements, or from circumstantial evidence, like the use of a third party to disguise the true owner, or unusual secrecy. <i>See United States v. Castro-Lara,</i> 970 F.2d 976, 981 (1st Cir.1992) (\"[C]ircumstantial evidence, in and of itself, is often enough to ground a conviction.\"); <i>see also Bourjaily v. United States,</i> 483 U.S. 171, 179-80, 107 S.Ct. 2775, 97 L.Ed.2d 144 (1987) (\"[I]ndividual pieces of evidence, insufficient in themselves to prove a point, may in cumulation prove it.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cruzado essentially challenges only the fourth element, intent to conceal. In his view, merely depositing his ill-gotten gains in the account of Oficina Dental Las Colinas, Inc., hardly signifies an intent to conceal. Cruzado was well known all over Vega Alta as the mayor and as a prominent citizen, and, according to him, no rational jury could conclude that Cruzado was trying to conceal the source of the money by depositing it in a bank where everyone knew him and knew his sources of income.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are, to say the least, unconvinced by this argument. Cruzado deposited these funds, as he did with the other sums he acquired, in an account in the name of his then-wife's former dental practice, for which he was the only signatory, and which he failed to report upon being elected mayor. No one else knew of the account. Every witness asked about the account testified that he or she had never heard of \"Onaden,\" but assumed that it was legitimate on the mayor's authority. A reasonable jury could easily have concluded that Cruzado intended to conceal the money there and use it for his own private purposes. We see no \"clear and gross injustice\" in this conviction. <i>Hadfield,</i> 918 F.2d at 996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Cruzado's preserved challenges</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>1. One count of embezzlement or theft of more than $5,000 from Vega Alta (count 1)</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To convict Cruzado on this count, the government had to prove three elements beyond a reasonable doubt: (i) that Cruzado was \"an agent of an organization, or of a State, local, or Indian tribal government, or any agency thereof;\" (ii) that Cruzado embezzled, stole, obtained by fraud, or converted or intentionally misapplied property \" valued at $5,000 or more\" from \"such organization, government, or agency;\" and (iii) that such \"organization, government, or agency receives, in any one year period [federal funds] in excess of $10,000.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 666(a) and (b). Theft can be committed in a variety of ways under &#167; 666. \"The first four prohibitions cover any possibility of taking money for one's own use or benefit. Intentional misapplication, in order to avoid redundancy, must mean intentional misapplication for otherwise legitimate purposes; if it were for illegitimate purposes, it would be covered by the prohibitions against embezzlement, stealing, obtaining by fraud, or conversion.\" <i>United States v. Urlacher,</i> 979 F.2d 935, 938 (2d Cir.1992) (quoted in <i>United States v. Cornier-Ortiz,</i> 361 F.3d 29, 36-37 (1st Cir.2004)). The total value of funds stolen can be aggregated to satisfy the $5,000 minimum that triggers criminal liability under &#167; 666. <i>United States v. Sanderson,</i> 966 F.2d 184, 189 (6th Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cruzado concedes on appeal that he was an agent of a local government &#8212; namely, the mayor of Vega Alta &#8212; which received $10,000 or more in federal funds within a one-year period. He maintains, however, that the government failed to present sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable jury to conclude that he embezzled or stole more than $5,000 from Vega Alta. Without explanation, Cruzado limits his possible wrongdoing to two transactions: (1) Centro Cultural's $4,165 check to Onaden, which Cruzado wrote while in New York at the Puerto Rico Day Parade; and (2) the $1,756 check made out to \"cash,\" which he obtained from Ebanisteria Familia's owner, Col&#243;n, and which represented an overpayment from Vega Alta for work that Col&#243;n had not done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cruzado argues that, first, he spent the $4,165 on expenses related to the trip to New York. Even if he had not, however, the money belonged not to the municipality but to the parade committee, which had received it from Vega Alta with \"no strings attached.\" Therefore, if Cruzado stole any money, he did so from the committee, not Vega Alta. Second, Cruzado maintains that Col&#243;n owed him the $1,756 as interest on the money that Col&#243;n had borrowed from him as an advance. As noted, after Cruzado claimed that the municipality would not pay a deposit on Col&#243;n's newly contracted job (as Col&#243;n's other customers did), the mayor offered to provide a loan from his son's check-cashing business, El Cajero Expresso. Cruzado, in his words, \"might be guilty of being a smart businessman and/or a usurer, but he was not being accused of usury.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts, when viewed in the light most favorable to the government, easily support Cruzado's conviction on this count. First of all, as the government points out, Cruzado neglects to consider other incidents besides the two he cites as possibilities. For example, there was the $4,000 that he instructed Cristaler&#237;a's owner to skim from Vega Alta's double payment to him (one payment from Vega Alta's trust account, and one from its regular checking account). While arguing against the extortion conviction vis-&#224;-vis Cristaler&#237;a, Cruzado himself virtually concedes the theft by writing, \"Clearly, the evidence of what occurred on April 5th, 2001, the time period when the crime occurred, points to theft of Municipal funds, not extortion.\" In addition, there were two more payments related to the trip to New York; in both cases, Cruzado intercepted reimbursements from Sidney Travel that were intended for the committee (and, ultimately, the municipality) and deposited them in his own bank account. Those two payments amounted to $13,991.54.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even considering the two payments alone that Cruzado cites, a reasonable jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Cruzado took them for his own private gain. First, there is no evidence that Cruzado spent the $4,165 while in New York; to the contrary, that check was deposited into the Onaden account on July 3, several weeks after the trip had ended. Cruzado produced no receipts for the supposed expenditures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">His attempt to avoid the conviction by disputing that the municipality was the victim also fails. The parade committee, with Cruzado as its chairman, had agreed that any remaining funds would be given to the municipality. Furthermore, Vega Alta required an accounting of the funds received by the committee. A reasonable jury could have found that, by taking the $4,165, Cruzado was intercepting the money from being ultimately reimbursed to the municipality and such an interception constituted theft under &#167; 666.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A reasonable jury could also have disbelieved Cruzado's argument that the $1,756 that Cruzado took from Col&#243;n, Ebanisteria Familia's owner, represented interest on a loan. Cruzado had no evidence for this interpretation besides his own self-serving testimony, while Col&#243;n testified that Cruzado had specifically requested that he receive the excess funds from Vega Alta's payment. Believing Cruzado's explanation would require a perfect coincidence between, on the one hand, the amount that Col&#243;n owed Cruzado in interest and, on the other, Vega Alta's overpayment to Col&#243;n. The jury could reasonably reject such an argument that \"would elevate coincidence to an art form.\" <i>Lara,</i> 181 F.3d at 201.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>2. Two counts of extortion</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>a. Extortion of Sidney Travel (Count 4)</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cruzado twice intercepted refunds that Sidney Travel owed to the committee (and, ultimately, to the municipality) and deposited them in his private bank account. First, on May 25, 2001, he went to Sidney Travel and told its owner, Alonso, that instead of issuing a check to the committee, she should issue a check payable to Onaden, which he claimed to need for food money for children who were traveling to New York. Alonso complied, issuing the check to a payee she had never heard of, in large part because of Cruzado's authority as the mayor. Second, on July 6, 2001, Cruzado again instructed Alonso to issue a check payable to Onaden, which he deposited in his private account. She complied again, largely for the same reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cruzado claims that he was not acting as a public official but only as the chairman of a non-profit organization which was unaffiliated with the municipality. Hence, the \"under color of public office\" element of extortion does not apply. Cruzado also argues that the money was due to the committee as a refund anyway. Cruzado was the authorized representative for the committee; Alonso knew that. Therefore, a rational jury could not conclude that Cruzado induced her to part with property for unlawful reasons, when he was merely asking her for a refund under the authority that he had. Finally, Cruzado argues that he returned the money as soon as he could (which happened to be soon after the government opened its investigation); he notes that there was no deadline to return the money, and he should not be punished for the government's unexpectedly hasty actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These are specious arguments. First, Cruzado did not divest himself of his authority as mayor when he walked in the door of Sidney Travel, especially when his mission on behalf of the parade committee was so closely tied to the municipality itself; Cruzado was chairman because he was the mayor, the committee had several other government officials as members, and the committee's entire reason for being was the celebration of the municipality's 225th anniversary. A reasonable jury could have believed that Cruzado knew that his authority would allow him to obtain the refunds from Alonso, in return for his continued good graces and future business from the municipality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cruzado's other two arguments are easily dispatched. His argument that the money was owed to the committee anyway is simply question-begging. Of course the money was owed to the committee. Cruzado's criminal conduct relates to what happened to that money before it could get to the committee. Finally, Cruzado's argument that he returned the money (a point which he repeated throughout trial and on appeal) is little more than an implicit admission of guilt and a plea for leniency. The jury was entitled to accord little if any weight to such eleventh-hour maneuvers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, Cruzado's mishmash of allegedly innocent mistakes and neutral explanations fails to convince us that a reasonable jury could not have found Cruzado guilty of extorting money from Sidney Travel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>b.

Dr. Rivera testified that he understood the payment to be for the air conditioner that had been installed in the CDT's dentistry office (at Cruzado's instruction), even though that air conditioner had by then been removed (again, at Cruzado's instruction). Dr. Gonz&#225;lez, meanwhile, had earlier promised to give the mayor a $5,000 political contribution; he testified that he understood the July 10 payment to be for that purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cruzado repeats here his argument that what looks like extortion was in fact only a political contribution. To sustain a conviction under the Hobbs Act for political contributions, he stresses, requires showing that the public official promised a specific <i>quid pro quo, see McCormick,</i> 500 U.S. at 274, 111 S.Ct. 1807, and he did not promise anything. In support of his argument, he describes the two doctors' testimony as contradictory, resolving that supposed contradiction in favor of Dr. Gonz&#225;lez's professed understanding that the $5,000 payment was a political contribution. Cruzado argues that Dr. Rivera would not have paid for an air conditioner on July 10 which had already been removed by June 14. In Cruzado's view, then, Dr. Rivera testified untruthfully, and the $5,000 check must have been a political contribution as testified to by the person who authorized the check, Dr. Gonz&#225;lez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A reasonable jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that, despite the past discussion between the mayor and Dr. Gonz&#225;lez of a political contribution, Cruzado asked for a check made out to \"Onaden\" so that he could deposit the check in his own private bank account, and the doctors were too scared to refuse him. After all, they both testified to their critical dependence on the municipality for ambulance service. The jury could have further concluded that the sham invoice given to Dr. Rivera served to cover the illegal conduct initiated by Cruzado. The mystery of paying for an air conditioner that had already been removed from the CDT's premises only further buttresses such an inference.

Four counts of laundering money</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cruzado was convicted of laundering money derived from illegal transactions involving Sidney Travel (counts 5 and 8), Centro Cultural (count 7), and Vega Alta Medical Hospital (count 9). Cruzado's argument here is the same as his argument for the count charging him with laundering money from Cristaler&#237;a: no rational jury could conclude that Cruzado was trying to conceal the source of his money, when he was simply depositing the money in a bank where everyone knew him and knew his sources of income.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our response, too, remains the same. A reasonable jury could easily have concluded that Cruzado was concealing these funds in the Onaden account, which was unknown to anyone else and for which he was the only signatory. That is a paradigm case of money laundering, and a reasonable jury was free to so find beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>4. One count of tampering with three potential witnesses (Count 11)</i>\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To convict Cruzado on this count, the government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he: (i) knowingly (ii) used intimidation, threatened, corruptly persuaded another person, or attempted to do so, or engaged in misleading conduct toward another person (iii) with intent to influence testimony (iv) in an official proceeding. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1512(b)(1). Trying to persuade a witness to give false testimony counts as \"corruptly persuading\" under &#167; 1512(b). <i>United States v. Khatami,</i> 280 F.3d 907, 912-13 (9th Cir.2002) (citing cases). However, \"it is an affirmative defense, as to which the defendant has the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence, that the conduct consisted solely of lawful conduct and that the defendant's sole intention was to encourage, induce, or cause the other person to testify truthfully.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1512(e) (2005) (formerly subsection (d)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury found Cruzado guilty of tampering or attempting to tamper with the testimony of Cuevas (Cristaler&#237;a's owner) on or about October 9, 2001; Drs. Gonz&#225;lez and Rivera (owners of Vega Alta Medical Hospital, Inc.) on October 17, 2001; and Marrero (owner of Premier Electrical) in a telephone call on December 10, 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cruzado's argument is simple: all he did was urge witnesses to tell the truth, which is not a crime. According to the witnesses, Cruzado did ask that they tell the truth; however, his version of \"the truth\" that he urged upon them was anything but the truth. To Cuevas, Cruzado described the $4,000 as repayment of a loan extended to Cuevas before he became mayor. At first, Cuevas maintained that story in front of the FBI. He then changed his tune, admitting that the money was skimmed from the inflated bid he submitted to Vega Alta and the double payment he received in return. As for the doctors, the jury was entitled to reject Cruzado's characterization of the $5,000 payment as a political contribution, and instead find that the doctors' need for the mayor's good graces induced them to hand over the money. Even with respect to Dr. Rivera's testimony &#8212; that he believed the money was for the air conditioner, as evidenced by the invoice he received (on Onaden letterhead) &#8212; the jury could have found that Cruzado was trying to persuade a witness to testify to something other than his true beliefs. Finally, the jury could have found that Cruzado's repeated calls to Marrero and his continued interest in Marrero's business affairs, which culminated in Marrero's hiring a lawyer to send a cease-and-desist letter, constituted tampering.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <p>A. Choosing the correct guidelines manual</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a threshold matter, a sentencing court must first decide which edition of the sentencing guidelines to use. A defendant should be sentenced according to the guidelines in effect on the date of sentencing, unless \"the court determines that use of the Guidelines Manual in effect on the date that the defendant is sentenced would violate the ex post facto clause of the United States Constitution,\" in which case \"the court shall use the Guidelines Manual in effect on the date that the offense of conviction was committed.\" USSG &#167; 1B1.11(b)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Cruzado was sentenced on November 8, 2002, seven days after the November 1 effective date of the 2002 guidelines. Nevertheless, the PSR used a two-year-old edition of the guidelines, its only explanation being the flat assertion that the \"2000 edition... has been used in this case to comply with the provisions of Guidelines &#167; 1B1.11(b)(1).\" The district court followed the PSR's lead and sentenced Cruzado under the 2000 edition of the guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PSR and the district court made a mistake, however, because Cruzado's last offense of conviction occurred on December 10, 2001, thereby making the 2001 guidelines &#8212; not 2000 &#8212; the relevant comparison with the 2002 guidelines for ex post facto purposes. Even in a complex case like this one, involving conduct that occurred on dates implicating different versions of the manual, \"it will not be necessary to compare more than two manuals to determine the applicable guideline range &#8212; the manual in effect <i>at the time the last offense of conviction was completed</i> and the manual in effect at the time of sentencing.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1B1.11, cmt. background (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Count 11 charged Cruzado with, among other things, unlawful conduct on December 10, 2001 &#8212; tampering with the owner of Premier Electrical. Cruzado was convicted of that offense. December 10, 2001, was more than a month after the effective date of the guidelines' 2001 edition. Therefore, the comparison for ex post facto purposes is between the 2002 edition and the 2001 edition. As it turns out, the relevant sentencing guidelines did not change between those two years. Therefore, Cruzado is right that he should have been sentenced under the 2002 guidelines, and the court, misled by the PSR, plainly erred in applying the 2000 guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Reasons for remanding</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arguably, we could continue our analysis to see if Cruzado was prejudiced by the application of the 2000 guidelines. <i>See United States v. Sedoma,</i> 332 F.3d 20, 28 (1st Cir.2003) (reviewing a sentence for plain error). That analysis might reveal that a sentence under the 2002 guidelines would involve the same guidelines range as the 2000 guidelines. On the other hand, Cruzado argues that he would receive a lower sentence under the 2002 guidelines, while the government and the district court believe that he would receive a higher sentence. For two reasons, however, we decline to undertake such an analysis here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, between the 2000 and 2002 editions, the sentencing commission introduced a major change in the way that sentences for money laundering are calculated. The 2000 guidelines simply gave a fixed number as the base offense level for money laundering. The 2002 guidelines take a more complicated approach by incorporating the offense level of the underlying offense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Sentencing under that new regime might involve factual disputes or legal issues which the district court has not yet had an opportunity to address. If we were to explore this uncharted territory ourselves, we, in effect, would be doing the sentencing rather than the district court. That is not an appropriate allocation of functions. <i>See Koon v. United States,</i> 518 U.S. 81, 98, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996) (\"District courts have an institutional advantage over appellate courts\" in some sentencing matters.); <i>United States v. Rivera,</i> 994 F.2d 942, 950 (1st Cir.1993) (Breyer, C.J.) (referring to district courts'\"institutional strength\" as being able to \"best understand the relation of the Guidelines to case-specific, detailed facts\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, after <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. ___, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the sentencing guidelines are now advisory rather than mandatory. <i>See also United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d 68 (1st Cir.2005). That legal development injects even more uncertainty into an attempt by us to reconstruct a sentencing decision by the district court under the 2002 guidelines. Therefore, we conclude that the most prudent course is to vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing under the correct edition of the guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We <i>AFFIRM</i> Cruzado's convictions.

On January 25, 2002, a federal grand jury returned a superseding indictment that charged him with a number of crimes tied to abuse of his public office, including extortion, embezzlement, theft, money laundering, and witness tampering. After a fourteen-day trial, Cruzado was convicted of the following charges: one count of embezzlement from a program receiving federal funds, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 666(a)(1)(A)(i) and (a)(1)(A)(ii); five counts of extortion, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1951(a); five counts of money laundering, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1956(a)(1)(B)(i) and (a)(1)(B)(ii); and one count of tampering with witnesses, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1512(b)(1) and (b)(2). The district court sentenced Cruzado to 63 months' imprisonment on all counts except for the witness tampering, for which Cruzado received 12 months. The sentences were to run concurrently with each other. In this appeal, Cruzado challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his counts of conviction. He also argues that his sentence was erroneously calculated. Although we affirm the convictions, we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first provide a brief overview of the case, taking our information from the record as viewed in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict. <i>See United States v. Lara,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764882\"><a href=\"/opinion/764882/united-states-v-giovanni-lara-appellantno-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">181</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">183</span></a></span>, 190 (1st Cir.1999). We reserve a fuller discussion of the facts for later sections to which they are particularly relevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After graduating from the University of Puerto Rico in 1969, Cruzado taught advanced mathematics at a local high school until 1976. At that point, he moved into the construction business. In 1992, he went into business with his then-wife, a pediatric dentist, who opened a medical practice, incorporated as Oficina Dental Las Colinas, Inc., often referred to by its acronym, Onaden, Inc. From 1992 to 1995, Cruzado handled routine administrative tasks for Onaden, including the opening of a bank account at a local branch of Banco Popular, which would later prove useful to his criminal endeavors. The account, in the name of Oficina Dental Las Colinas, Inc., with Cruzado as the only signatory, was used for such items as lease payments. When Cruzado became mayor, however, he did not disclose the account's existence as required by the Ethics Office for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From 1996 to 2000, Cruzado ran a check-cashing business, El Cajero Expresso. In November 2000, Cruzado was elected mayor of Vega Alta &#8212; his first try at running for public office &#8212; as a member of the Popular Democratic Party and was duly sworn into office on January 8, 2001. Upon his election, Cruzado appears to have sold the check-cashing business to his oldest son, who took over day-to-day control. Cruzado, however, retained the last word in business affairs and kept control over the business's checking account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Within a scant few weeks of becoming mayor, Cruzado began using his official position to embezzle and extort thousands of dollars from the municipality and from contractors who were working for the municipality; he then laundered the money in the Onaden bank account. We now describe the particulars of his criminal activity. (See the chart, attached as an appendix, for a summary of the charges and parties involved.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Cristaler&#237;a Vega Alta, Inc.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cristaler&#237;a Vega Alta is a firm that installs and repairs glass and aluminum doors. Cristaler&#237;a's owner, Juan Cuevas Rodr&#237;guez, first got to know Cruzado through Cristaler&#237;a's glass work for Cruzado's construction business. Shortly after Cruzado took office in January 2001, he embarked on an extensive program to renovate Vega Alta's city hall, which was in poor shape. Cruzado requested that Cristaler&#237;a perform some locksmithing and remodeling work on the building, and he asked Cuevas for a price estimate. Cuevas quoted a price of $5,814. Cruzado then told Cuevas to add $2,000 to his quote and give the extra money to him. Fearing that he might be cut off from future work if he disobeyed, Cuevas obliged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cristaler&#237;a's contract provided that the company would be paid from a trust account of the municipality at Banco Santander, whose funds were reserved for making improvements to the city hall. For some reason, there was a delay in the disbursement of those funds. Cruzado spoke to Vega Alta's director of finance, Damien O. Col&#243;n Pab&#243;n, telling him that Cristaler&#237;a was getting impatient about the delay and asking whether the municipality could expedite payment. Col&#243;n told Cruzado that the municipality's regular checking account might be faster, although disbursing funds from that account would require additional paperwork: price quotes, invoices, and various other papers. Also, when Banco Santander eventually made the disbursement from the trust account, that money would have to be put into the municipality's checking account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cruzado then informed Cuevas that, to be paid, he would need to procure some other, competing bids that were higher than Cristaler&#237;a's. Cuevas complied: he approached two competing glass shops and told them to prepare fake bids that were higher than Cristaler&#237;a's quote. They agreed to do so, even though they had no intention of submitting a formal bid for the work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 4, 2001, the check from the trust account to pay Cristaler&#237;a for its work was delivered to Cruzado's office. Colon requested that the mayor deposit the check into the municipality's checking account. The mayor responded that Cristaler&#237;a would be working for the municipality in the future, and that the check would be used to pay for that work. Colon criticized that plan, reaffirming that the check should go into Vega Alta's checking account and that, if Cristaler&#237;a needed to be paid for new work, then a new contract should be drawn up and the disbursements could be made on that basis. Cruzado assured Colon that those formalities were not necessary; he would be responsible for retaining the check and making payments to Cristaler&#237;a.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cristaler&#237;a was then paid twice for its work, receiving checks from both of Vega Alta's bank accounts. Specifically, on March 23, 2001, Cuevas picked up a check from city hall, drawn on the municipality's regular checking account, for the inflated price of $8,549 (minus a certain sum that Cuevas owed the municipality in licensing fees). Cuevas deposited that check in Cristaler&#237;a's bank account. Then, on April 4, 2001, Cuevas received a visit in his office from Cruzado, who came bearing another check, this one also for $8,549 (again, minus certain immaterial deductions) drawn from the trust account. Cruzado told Cuevas to take the check, explaining that Cristaler&#237;a would earn the double payment by doing more jobs for Vega Alta in the future. The next day, April 5, 2001, Cuevas issued two checks drawn on Cristaler&#237;a's account, each for $2,000: one made out to \"cash,\" and one made out to \"Onaden, Inc.,\" according to Cruzado's instructions. Cruzado's chauffeur cashed the first check at the check-cashing business of Cruzado's son and gave Cruzado the money, while Cruzado deposited the second check into the Onaden account at Banco Popular.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early October 2001, Cruzado asked to meet with Cuevas, telling him he had something important to discuss. He claimed that he was being audited, and that he was nervous about the $2,000 check that Cuevas had issued to Onaden, Inc. Cruzado told Cuevas that, if asked about the check, he should say that it was a repayment of a loan extended to him by Cruzado before becoming mayor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Sidney Travel and Tours, Inc.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 2001, Vega Alta was celebrating its 225th anniversary and, at Cruzado's request, the organizers of the annual Puerto Rico Day Parade in New York were going to dedicate that year's parade to the town. As mayor, Cruzado formed a committee, called the Puerto Rico Day Parade Committee, to raise money and arrange for Vega Alta's delegation to travel to New York for the June parade. The committee, which was composed of governmental employees and representatives from local cultural groups, opened a checking account under the name \"Centro Cultural de Vega Alta,\" which had two signatories, neither of whom was Cruzado. The Committee chose a local travel agency, Sidney Travel and Tours, to arrange for airplane tickets, ground transportation, and hotels. Cruzado was the only member of the committee who was handling lodging and hotel accommodations. Sidney Travel's owner, Lilia Alonso Alvarez, had numerous contacts over the next few months with the committee while planning the trip to New York. Between April and June 2001, the committee raised about $160,000: $40,000 given by the municipality's assembly, the rest through private donations. Any money not needed for the trip was to be refunded to the municipality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The committee put down an initial deposit with Sidney Travel to secure plane and hotel reservations. As the date of the parade neared and the travel arrangements assumed their final form, Alonso calculated that (1) the committee owed Sidney Travel $67,240.90; and (2) Sidney Travel owed the committee a refund of $14,816.74, which could be offset against the larger amount. Alonso informed the committee of her tally. On May 25, 2001, Cruzado arrived at Sidney Travel for a financial reckoning, bearing a blank check from Centro Cultural's account. He was alone. Instead of allowing Alonso to credit the entire $14,816.74 to the committee's account, Cruzado told her that he wanted part of the credit as a separate payment, which would be useful to him as food money for children who would be attending the parade. So instructed, Alonso made out a check for $5,816.74 to Onaden, Inc., and credited the remaining $9,000 to the committee's balance. The mayor then paid off the balance with a Centro Cultural check for $58,240.90. He later deposited the Onaden check into his private account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In New York, Cruzado stayed at the Grand Hyatt Hotel, while most of Vega Alta's other parade attendees stayed at the Marriot Marquis. On June 11, 2001, the day after the parade, Cruzado sent a messenger to speak to Marilyn Garc&#237;a, who served as one of the two signatories on Centro Cultural checks. Cruzado's message: he wanted three signed, blank checks drawn on the Centro Cultural account. Garc&#237;a handed over the checks. Cruzado made out the first two checks to the Grand Hyatt; the third, he made out to Onaden, Inc., in the amount of $4,164. On July 3, 2001, that check was deposited in the Onaden account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 6, 2001, after the trip was over, Sidney Travel made a final accounting. Again, a refund was due to the committee. Cruzado went to Sidney Travel himself and instructed Alonso to issue a check in the name of Onaden, Inc., for $8,174.80. Later, that check was deposited into Onaden's account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 3, 2001, the Federal Bureau of Investigation spoke to Alonso about Cruzado's role in the committee's travel preparations. The next day, she informed Cruzado of the FBI's interest in his dealings. Cruzado then made out an Onaden check for $13,991.54 (the total of Sidney Travel's May 25 and July 6 checks to Onaden), dated it July 7, 2001, and deposited it into the Centro Cultural account on August 13, 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Vega Alta Medical Hospital, Inc.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like city hall, Vega Alta's local health clinic, the Centro de Diagn&#243;stico y Tratamiento (CDT), needed renovations. Located throughout Puerto Rico, CDTs provide basic health care to local populations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Shortly before the events of this case, Puerto Rico had privatized many CDTs. Vega Alta's CDT had been purchased by a partnership formed by two doctors: Luis Gonz&#225;lez Berm&#250;dez and Emilio Rivera Costas. The partnership was named Vega Alta Medical Hospital, Inc. The partners divided their responsibilities: Dr. Gonz&#225;lez was the medical director, while Dr. Rivera was the administrator, handling tasks relating to maintenance, repair, and management. The partners had agreed with the municipality (although not in a written contract) that Vega Alta would provide two services &#8212; ambulance service, crucial to the CDT's functioning, as well as groundskeeping. Vega Alta had also agreed to donate an old, unused mobile health vehicle, which the CDT could repair and then use to provide health care to rural and outlying areas. Dr. Gonz&#225;lez testified that the municipality was in charge of maintaining and fixing the CDT's physical facilities, as directed by Dr. Rivera.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vega Alta's CDT also lacked air conditioning in the emergency room and administrative offices, a violation of Puerto Rico's health code. The doctors had been soliciting quotes from several air-conditioning businesses to remedy the problem. In January 2001, Cruzado visited the CDT for the first time, where he met with Dr. Rivera, who explained to him some of their problems. Cruzado said that he would send over a company, Martinez Air Conditioning, who had done some work for the municipality in the past, and that Dr. Rivera need not continue seeking bids. Cruzado also informed Dr. Rivera that Mart&#237;nez Air Conditioning would install an air-conditioning unit in the CDT's dentistry office, located in a dilapidated and partially abandoned annex to the main building. Dr. Rivera protested that his priority was to get air conditioning for the emergency room, but Cruzado persisted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cruzado subsequently paid the CDT another visit to speak to Dr. Gonz&#225;lez, Dr. Rivera's partner. The two men were alone. Cruzado explained that his political party was trying to raise money through donations. Feeling pressured by the mayor's authority and aware of the CDT's critical need for ambulance service from the municipality, Dr. Gonz&#225;lez told him that he would contribute, even though Dr. Gonz&#225;lez did not belong to the mayor's political party. At the time, however, Dr. Gonz&#225;lez did not give the mayor any money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mart&#237;nez Air Conditioning then arrived on the premises, installed the air conditioner in the dentistry office, and invoiced the CDT for $2,895, which the CDT did not immediately pay. Meanwhile, Mart&#237;nez sent an invoice to the municipality for the same amount, from which he received a check on May 4, 2001. Shortly thereafter, the mayor asked Martinez to remove the air conditioner from the CDT, for reasons known only to himself, and to take it to a nearby police station. Mart&#237;nez did so, and was paid for his trouble with an $850 check from the municipality dated June 14, 2001.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 10, 2001, Cruzado arrived at the CDT and asked for money from Dr. Rivera, who understood the payment to be related to the air conditioner (which, by then, had already been both installed and removed). Dr. Rivera testified that he knew nothing about the political contribution that Cruzado and Dr. Gonz&#225;lez had discussed. Dr. Rivera asked for an invoice; Cruzado left for five or ten minutes and returned with an invoice for $5,000 on letterhead reading \"Onaden, Inc.\" The invoice referred, however, to work performed by Mart&#237;nez Air Conditioning.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Rivera had a blank payroll check available that had already been signed by Dr. Gonz&#225;lez. When Dr. Rivera called Dr. Gonz&#225;lez to inform him of the impending payment, the two partners did not discuss the purpose of the payment. Dr. Rivera merely informed Dr. Gonz&#225;lez that the mayor was there looking for money, and Dr. Gonz&#225;lez said that paying him was fine. According to their testimony, Dr. Rivera understood the payment to be for the air conditioner, and Dr. Gonz&#225;lez understood the payment to be the political contribution that he had discussed with the mayor earlier. Dr. Rivera then handed Cruzado a $5,000 check made out to Onaden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later in October, while being investigated by the FBI, Cruzado spoke to Dr. Rivera. Cruzado told Dr. Rivera to \"tell the truth,\" which, according to Cruzado, was that the payment was a political donation. Dr. Rivera refused, saying that he would maintain that the payment was for the air conditioner, as evidenced by the invoice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Ebanister&#237;a Familia</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ebanister&#237;a Familia is a woodworking shop in Vega Alta owned by Pedro A. Col&#243;n Mu&#241;oz, who knew Cruzado from patronizing his check-cashing business. During his mayoral campaign, Cruzado asked Col&#243;n for wooden poles to support advertising banners, which Col&#243;n provided free of charge. Soon after his election, Cruzado called Col&#243;n to city hall, where he explained that he wanted some glasswork and woodwork done in the lobby of the building, including seven wooden doors and some mahogany cabinets. Col&#243;n took some measurements and quoted a price of $7,500. Cruzado then requested some additional work. On February 12, 2001, Col&#243;n gave Cruzado a written price quote for $9,200, which included the requested extra work. Col&#243;n testified that, typically, he requested a 50 percent deposit from customers before beginning work, which he uses to buy materials. He was told by Cruzado, however, that the municipality did not pay such deposits. Cruzado then offered to lend Col&#243;n the money from his son's check-cashing business. Col&#243;n went to El Cajero Expresso and received $5,200.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Col&#243;n had begun the work, Cruzado told him to reduce the scope of the project, eliminating much of the extra work which would have raised the project cost to $9,200. Col&#243;n complied and eventually installed the woodwork at city hall. On April 4, 2001, Cruzado arrived at Col&#243;n's place of business bearing a $8,556 check ($9,200 minus 7 percent taxes), drawn on the municipality's trust fund at Banco Santander. Evidently, the municipality's payment had not been adjusted downward to account for the reduced work. Cruzado asked Col&#243;n to take the check and give the excess funds back in the form of a check payable to cash. Col&#243;n's wife, a certified public accountant who helped with the family business, later prepared a check payable to herself for $6,956 (the $5,200 loan plus the municipality's $1,756 overpayment), endorsed it, and gave the check to Col&#243;n. Col&#243;n dropped off the check, which was now as good as cash, at the check-cashing business of Cruzado's son. The check was later cashed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">E. Premier Electrical and General Contractors, Inc.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Premier Electrical and General Contractors, Inc. (Premier Electrical), was owned by Juan Marrero Visalden, an electrician. On June 19, 2001, Marrero contracted with Vega Alta (Cruzado signed the contract) to build a local indoor basketball court, which would include cement foundations, bathrooms, a cafeteria, sidewalks, wiring work, and drainage. The base price for the project was $293,000; with some additional items, the total price was $342,000. After signing the contract, Premier Electrical began work in June or July.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cruzado paid occasional visits to the site, observing the work and making casual conversation with Marrero. On one visit in September, Cruzado asked Marrero for a $10,000 payment for the Centro Cultural de Vega Alta. Marrero, who testified that he felt \"rather stunned\" by the request, agreed to pay. When Marrero asked how he could contact Cruzado, the mayor gave Marrero his business card, on which he had written his cell phone number.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 28, 2001, Marrero issued a $10,000 check payable to \"Centro Cultural de Vega Alta,\" drawn on Premier Electrical's account. By coincidence, that same day Cruzado showed up at the project site. When Marrero told him that the check was ready, however, the mayor told him to prepare a different check payable to \"cash.\" The mayor said that he needed the money to take care of some \"problems\" at the Centro Cultural. On October 15, 2001, Marrero followed those instructions, issued the new check, and gave it to the mayor at his office in city hall.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Cruzado was arrested on October 24, Marrero discovered that the check had not been cashed yet. The next day, he ordered his bank to stop payment on it. Later, when Cruzado had posted bond, he paid another visit to the project site. Cruzado asked what Marrero had done with the check. When Marrero told him that he had stopped payment on it, Cruzado told him he had done, in Marrero's words, \"a good job.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later, when Cruzado was no longer mayor, he kept calling Marrero. For example, he informed Marrero that his company had won a bid that it had submitted to Vega Alta for improvements to a local baseball field. Marrero knew that he had won the bid but had yet to receive any official papers confirming that fact. In that conversation, Cruzado also asked him whether he had met with the FBI. When Marrero admitted that he had, Cruzado told him that he would have to call him back. Eventually, Marrero felt compelled to retain an attorney, who sent a letter to Cruzado asking that he stop calling and checking into Marrero's business affairs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">F.

Vargas L&#243;pez, did business under the name Ferreteria Mundo as a construction company and hardware store. Like Colon, the owner of Ebanisteria Familia, Vargas knew Cruzado from using his check-cashing business. Vargas, too, helped with Cruzado's mayoral campaign, setting up platforms for political rallies without charge. In September 2001, Cruzado took Vargas to a neighborhood in Vega Alta, where they discussed a possible construction project involving sidewalks, curbs, and drainage. Cruzado asked for a price quote from Vargas. A few days later, after taking some measurements, Vargas delivered a written estimate of $39,500 to the clerk's office at city hall. Vargas then received a telephone call from the mayor, who asked him to add $2,000 to his quote. Vargas refused, explaining that he was reluctant to pass the $40,000 mark in his bid.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Moreover, Vargas believed that Cruzado wanted the extra money for his private benefit. Consequently, Vargas refused to add $2,000 to his bid, and Cruzado then told him that the project would not be built because of a lack of funds. Cruzado was arrested shortly thereafter, and another contractor later completed most of the work that Cruzado and Vargas had discussed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some time in 2001, the federal government began investigating Cruzado's conduct. During that investigation, Cruzado added to his troubles when he attempted to tamper with potential witnesses, the owners of Cristaler&#237;a and Vega Alta Medical Hospital. The mayor was eventually indicted and arrested on October 24, 2001. Cruzado posted bond on November 2, 2001, and was released, whereupon he tampered with another potential witness, the owner of Premier Electrical.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 25, 2002, the grand jury returned a 14-count superseding indictment, charging Cruzado with the following offenses:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; Count 1: embezzlement, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 666(a)(1)(A)(i) and (a)(1)(A)(ii);</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; Counts 2, 4, 6, 12, 13, &amp; 14: extortion, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1951(a);</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; Counts 3, 5, 7, 8, 9 &amp; 10: money laundering, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1956(a)(1)(B)(i) and 1956(a)(1)(B)(ii);</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; Count 11: tampering with witnesses, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1512(b)(1) and 1512(b)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These counts are listed on the chart attached as an appendix to this opinion, which shows how Cruzado's laundering counts all derive from money that he was charged with embezzling or extorting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial began on May 20, 2002. The government used a combination of testimony from Cruzado's victims and acquaintances, along with documentary evidence of cancelled checks and the like, to build its case. After the government rested on May 28, Cruzado filed a motion for judgment of acquittal on counts 1, 4 through 10, and 11 (thereby declining to challenge counts 2, 3, 12, 13, and 14). That motion was denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his defense, through the cross-examination of government witnesses and his own testimony, Cruzado tried to characterize some payments as political contributions; as for others, he stressed that they had been innocent mistakes and that he had eventually returned the money (he had returned some payments after the government had begun investigating his dealings). He also used character witnesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Cruzado rested his case on June 5, he renewed his motion for judgment of acquittal, which the court granted as to count 10. On June 7, the jury found Cruzado guilty on all remaining counts except count 12, for which it returned a verdict of not guilty. On June 14, Cruzado filed a second motion for judgment of acquittal as to all remaining counts except 2, 3, 13, and 14, which the court denied on July 31, 2002. On November 8, 2002, Cruzado was sentenced to 63 months in prison for Counts 1 through 9, 13, and 14; and 1 year for Count 11, the terms to run concurrently. More than a year later, on November 24, 2003, the district court ordered Cruzado to pay restitution in the amount of $14,251.82 to Vega Alta.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review <i>de novo</i> a district court's denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal under Fed.R.Crim.P. 29.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Our task is to decide \"whether, after assaying all the evidence in the light most amiable to the government, and taking all reasonable inferences in its favor, a rational factfinder could find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the prosecution successfully proved the essential elements of the crime.\" <i>United States v.

After Cuevas was paid twice for the same work (one payment from the municipality's trust account, one from the city's regular checking account), Cuevas paid Cruzado $4,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cruzado first stresses that the only evidence as to Cruzado's reason for requesting an extra $2,000 was Cuevas's testimony, which he assails as \"speculative.\" Next, he claims that Cuevas never gave him the money. Finally, Cruzado makes the curious argument that what really happened was theft, not extortion, because the money did not truly belong to Cuevas but to the municipality: \"In order for there to be extortion the money must have belonged to Mr. Cuevas. However, the money they shared belonged to the municipality.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cruzado's first two arguments reduce to a simple credibility dispute: Cuevas's account supports the conviction, while Cruzado's does not. Appellate courts, however, are wisely reluctant to \"second-guess\" a jury's credibility determination. <i>United States v.

In the context of a sufficiency challenge, moreover, we are bound to \"resolve all credibility disputes in the verdict's favor.\" <i>Taylor,</i> 54 F.3d at 974.

The statute does not require that a victim of extortion part with his own property. Indeed, \"a defendant's claim of right to the property is irrelevant.

To be sure, the rightful owner of the $4,000 was the municipality, not Cuevas; it was paying for work that it had not received. Still, a reasonable jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the mayor induced Cuevas to part with the money when Cuevas had actual possession over the property &#8212; actual possession being \"the state of immediate, hands-on physical possession.\" <i>United States v.

Here, Cruzado avers that he promised nothing specific in return for accepting the \"contribution,\" and that therefore a reasonable jury could not have found him guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument leads nowhere. Although Cruzado asserts that the payment was a political contribution, he does not point to any evidence showing that Centro Cultural was a political body or had anything to do with his political campaign. In fact, Centro Cultural was not under the control of Cruzado's political party or of any political party. While the committee had a number of governmental representatives on it, there was no testimony that they were members of a particular party. Moreover, the governmental representatives were outnumbered on the committee by members of other cultural groups, which belies the idea that the committee was \"controlled\" by Cruzado's party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, according to the testimony of Premier Electrical's owner, Cruzado requested in the end that the check be made out to \"cash,\" not \"Centro Cultural.\" A reasonable jury could have inferred that Cruzado intended not to use the money for anything related to the committee's activities (especially because the committee was formed specifically for the Puerto Rico Day Parade, then more than three months in the past), and that Cruzado intended to cash the check and take the money for himself. The jury could have further inferred from Marrero's testimony that, if he did not pay Cruzado, the mayor would use his official power to punish Marrero in the future by withholding city business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>c.

Its owner, Vargas, knew Cruzado from his check-cashing business and had donated free supplies to his political campaign. As he did with Cristaler&#237;a's owner, Cruzado asked Vargas to pad his price quote with an extra $2,000, without explaining the purpose of the extra money. Vargas understood, however, that the money was for the mayor's private benefit. When Vargas refused to pay, Cruzado suddenly told him that there was no money after all for the project to build sidewalks, curbs, and drainage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cruzado assails this conviction as being based on sheer speculation as to his intent. It is true that, in this instance, the jury did not have the benefit of following the transaction through to completion, with the victim's checks deposited in the Onaden account (as with Cristaler&#237;a). However, the jury was well within its rights to believe Vargas's testimony and to find that Cruzado canceled the project (which was later built by someone else) as a reprisal for Vargas's refusal to submit to his demands for money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>2.

In his view, merely depositing his ill-gotten gains in the account of Oficina Dental Las Colinas, Inc., hardly signifies an intent to conceal. Cruzado was well known all over Vega Alta as the mayor and as a prominent citizen, and, according to him, no rational jury could conclude that Cruzado was trying to conceal the source of the money by depositing it in a bank where everyone knew him and knew his sources of income.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are, to say the least, unconvinced by this argument. Cruzado deposited these funds, as he did with the other sums he acquired, in an account in the name of his then-wife's former dental practice, for which he was the only signatory, and which he failed to report upon being elected mayor. No one else knew of the account. Every witness asked about the account testified that he or she had never heard of \"Onaden,\" but assumed that it was legitimate on the mayor's authority. A reasonable jury could easily have concluded that Cruzado intended to conceal the money there and use it for his own private purposes.

He maintains, however, that the government failed to present sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable jury to conclude that he embezzled or stole more than $5,000 from Vega Alta. Without explanation, Cruzado limits his possible wrongdoing to two transactions: (1) Centro Cultural's $4,165 check to Onaden, which Cruzado wrote while in New York at the Puerto Rico Day Parade; and (2) the $1,756 check made out to \"cash,\" which he obtained from Ebanisteria Familia's owner, Col&#243;n, and which represented an overpayment from Vega Alta for work that Col&#243;n had not done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cruzado argues that, first, he spent the $4,165 on expenses related to the trip to New York. Even if he had not, however, the money belonged not to the municipality but to the parade committee, which had received it from Vega Alta with \"no strings attached.\" Therefore, if Cruzado stole any money, he did so from the committee, not Vega Alta. Second, Cruzado maintains that Col&#243;n owed him the $1,756 as interest on the money that Col&#243;n had borrowed from him as an advance. As noted, after Cruzado claimed that the municipality would not pay a deposit on Col&#243;n's newly contracted job (as Col&#243;n's other customers did), the mayor offered to provide a loan from his son's check-cashing business, El Cajero Expresso. Cruzado, in his words, \"might be guilty of being a smart businessman and/or a usurer, but he was not being accused of usury.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts, when viewed in the light most favorable to the government, easily support Cruzado's conviction on this count. First of all, as the government points out, Cruzado neglects to consider other incidents besides the two he cites as possibilities. For example, there was the $4,000 that he instructed Cristaler&#237;a's owner to skim from Vega Alta's double payment to him (one payment from Vega Alta's trust account, and one from its regular checking account). While arguing against the extortion conviction vis-&#224;-vis Cristaler&#237;a, Cruzado himself virtually concedes the theft by writing, \"Clearly, the evidence of what occurred on April 5th, 2001, the time period when the crime occurred, points to theft of Municipal funds, not extortion.\" In addition, there were two more payments related to the trip to New York; in both cases, Cruzado intercepted reimbursements from Sidney Travel that were intended for the committee (and, ultimately, the municipality) and deposited them in his own bank account. Those two payments amounted to $13,991.54.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even considering the two payments alone that Cruzado cites, a reasonable jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Cruzado took them for his own private gain. First, there is no evidence that Cruzado spent the $4,165 while in New York; to the contrary, that check was deposited into the Onaden account on July 3, several weeks after the trip had ended. Cruzado produced no receipts for the supposed expenditures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">His attempt to avoid the conviction by disputing that the municipality was the victim also fails. The parade committee, with Cruzado as its chairman, had agreed that any remaining funds would be given to the municipality. Furthermore, Vega Alta required an accounting of the funds received by the committee. A reasonable jury could have found that, by taking the $4,165, Cruzado was intercepting the money from being ultimately reimbursed to the municipality and such an interception constituted theft under &#167; 666.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A reasonable jury could also have disbelieved Cruzado's argument that the $1,756 that Cruzado took from Col&#243;n, Ebanisteria Familia's owner, represented interest on a loan. Cruzado had no evidence for this interpretation besides his own self-serving testimony, while Col&#243;n testified that Cruzado had specifically requested that he receive the excess funds from Vega Alta's payment. Believing Cruzado's explanation would require a perfect coincidence between, on the one hand, the amount that Col&#243;n owed Cruzado in interest and, on the other, Vega Alta's overpayment to Col&#243;n. The jury could reasonably reject such an argument that \"would elevate coincidence to an art form.\" <i>Lara,</i> 181 F.3d at 201.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>2.

First, on May 25, 2001, he went to Sidney Travel and told its owner, Alonso, that instead of issuing a check to the committee, she should issue a check payable to Onaden, which he claimed to need for food money for children who were traveling to New York. Alonso complied, issuing the check to a payee she had never heard of, in large part because of Cruzado's authority as the mayor. Second, on July 6, 2001, Cruzado again instructed Alonso to issue a check payable to Onaden, which he deposited in his private account. She complied again, largely for the same reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cruzado claims that he was not acting as a public official but only as the chairman of a non-profit organization which was unaffiliated with the municipality. Hence, the \"under color of public office\" element of extortion does not apply. Cruzado also argues that the money was due to the committee as a refund anyway. Cruzado was the authorized representative for the committee; Alonso knew that. Therefore, a rational jury could not conclude that Cruzado induced her to part with property for unlawful reasons, when he was merely asking her for a refund under the authority that he had. Finally, Cruzado argues that he returned the money as soon as he could (which happened to be soon after the government opened its investigation); he notes that there was no deadline to return the money, and he should not be punished for the government's unexpectedly hasty actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These are specious arguments. First, Cruzado did not divest himself of his authority as mayor when he walked in the door of Sidney Travel, especially when his mission on behalf of the parade committee was so closely tied to the municipality itself; Cruzado was chairman because he was the mayor, the committee had several other government officials as members, and the committee's entire reason for being was the celebration of the municipality's 225th anniversary. A reasonable jury could have believed that Cruzado knew that his authority would allow him to obtain the refunds from Alonso, in return for his continued good graces and future business from the municipality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cruzado's other two arguments are easily dispatched. His argument that the money was owed to the committee anyway is simply question-begging. Of course the money was owed to the committee. Cruzado's criminal conduct relates to what happened to that money before it could get to the committee. Finally, Cruzado's argument that he returned the money (a point which he repeated throughout trial and on appeal) is little more than an implicit admission of guilt and a plea for leniency. The jury was entitled to accord little if any weight to such eleventh-hour maneuvers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, Cruzado's mishmash of allegedly innocent mistakes and neutral explanations fails to convince us that a reasonable jury could not have found Cruzado guilty of extorting money from Sidney Travel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>b.

Dr. Rivera testified that he understood the payment to be for the air conditioner that had been installed in the CDT's dentistry office (at Cruzado's instruction), even though that air conditioner had by then been removed (again, at Cruzado's instruction). Dr. Gonz&#225;lez, meanwhile, had earlier promised to give the mayor a $5,000 political contribution; he testified that he understood the July 10 payment to be for that purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cruzado repeats here his argument that what looks like extortion was in fact only a political contribution. To sustain a conviction under the Hobbs Act for political contributions, he stresses, requires showing that the public official promised a specific <i>quid pro quo, see McCormick,</i> 500 U.S. at 274, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112596\"><a href=\"/opinion/112596/mccormick-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1807</span></a></span>, and he did not promise anything. In support of his argument, he describes the two doctors' testimony as contradictory, resolving that supposed contradiction in favor of Dr. Gonz&#225;lez's professed understanding that the $5,000 payment was a political contribution. Cruzado argues that Dr. Rivera would not have paid for an air conditioner on July 10 which had already been removed by June 14. In Cruzado's view, then, Dr. Rivera testified untruthfully, and the $5,000 check must have been a political contribution as testified to by the person who authorized the check, Dr. Gonz&#225;lez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A reasonable jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that, despite the past discussion between the mayor and Dr. Gonz&#225;lez of a political contribution, Cruzado asked for a check made out to \"Onaden\" so that he could deposit the check in his own private bank account, and the doctors were too scared to refuse him. After all, they both testified to their critical dependence on the municipality for ambulance service. The jury could have further concluded that the sham invoice given to Dr. Rivera served to cover the illegal conduct initiated by Cruzado. The mystery of paying for an air conditioner that had already been removed from the CDT's premises only further buttresses such an inference. And Cruzado never explains what connection Onaden might have had to Cruzado's Popular Democratic Party, or why he gave Dr. Rivera an invoice for air-conditioning work in exchange for a political contribution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>3.

Cruzado's argument here is the same as his argument for the count charging him with laundering money from Cristaler&#237;a: no rational jury could conclude that Cruzado was trying to conceal the source of his money, when he was simply depositing the money in a bank where everyone knew him and knew his sources of income.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our response, too, remains the same. A reasonable jury could easily have concluded that Cruzado was concealing these funds in the Onaden account, which was unknown to anyone else and for which he was the only signatory. That is a paradigm case of money laundering, and a reasonable jury was free to so find beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>4.

However, \"it is an affirmative defense, as to which the defendant has the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence, that the conduct consisted solely of lawful conduct and that the defendant's sole intention was to encourage, induce, or cause the other person to testify truthfully.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1512(e) (2005) (formerly subsection (d)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury found Cruzado guilty of tampering or attempting to tamper with the testimony of Cuevas (Cristaler&#237;a's owner) on or about October 9, 2001; Drs. Gonz&#225;lez and Rivera (owners of Vega Alta Medical Hospital, Inc.) on October 17, 2001; and Marrero (owner of Premier Electrical) in a telephone call on December 10, 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cruzado's argument is simple: all he did was urge witnesses to tell the truth, which is not a crime. According to the witnesses, Cruzado did ask that they tell the truth; however, his version of \"the truth\" that he urged upon them was anything but the truth. To Cuevas, Cruzado described the $4,000 as repayment of a loan extended to Cuevas before he became mayor. At first, Cuevas maintained that story in front of the FBI. He then changed his tune, admitting that the money was skimmed from the inflated bid he submitted to Vega Alta and the double payment he received in return. As for the doctors, the jury was entitled to reject Cruzado's characterization of the $5,000 payment as a political contribution, and instead find that the doctors' need for the mayor's good graces induced them to hand over the money. Even with respect to Dr. Rivera's testimony &#8212; that he believed the money was for the air conditioner, as evidenced by the invoice he received (on Onaden letterhead) &#8212; the jury could have found that Cruzado was trying to persuade a witness to testify to something other than his true beliefs. Finally, the jury could have found that Cruzado's repeated calls to Marrero and his continued interest in Marrero's business affairs, which culminated in Marrero's hiring a lawyer to send a cease-and-desist letter, constituted tampering.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <p>A. Choosing the correct guidelines manual</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a threshold matter, a sentencing court must first decide which edition of the sentencing guidelines to use. A defendant should be sentenced according to the guidelines in effect on the date of sentencing, unless \"the court determines that use of the Guidelines Manual in effect on the date that the defendant is sentenced would violate the ex post facto clause of the United States Constitution,\" in which case \"the court shall use the Guidelines Manual in effect on the date that the offense of conviction was committed.\" USSG &#167; 1B1.11(b)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Cruzado was sentenced on November 8, 2002, seven days after the November 1 effective date of the 2002 guidelines. Nevertheless, the PSR used a two-year-old edition of the guidelines, its only explanation being the flat assertion that the \"2000 edition... has been used in this case to comply with the provisions of Guidelines &#167; 1B1.11(b)(1).\" The district court followed the PSR's lead and sentenced Cruzado under the 2000 edition of the guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PSR and the district court made a mistake, however, because Cruzado's last offense of conviction occurred on December 10, 2001, thereby making the 2001 guidelines &#8212; not 2000 &#8212; the relevant comparison with the 2002 guidelines for ex post facto purposes. Even in a complex case like this one, involving conduct that occurred on dates implicating different versions of the manual, \"it will not be necessary to compare more than two manuals to determine the applicable guideline range &#8212; the manual in effect <i>at the time the last offense of conviction was completed</i> and the manual in effect at the time of sentencing.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1B1.11, cmt. background (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Count 11 charged Cruzado with, among other things, unlawful conduct on December 10, 2001 &#8212; tampering with the owner of Premier Electrical. Cruzado was convicted of that offense. December 10, 2001, was more than a month after the effective date of the guidelines' 2001 edition. Therefore, the comparison for ex post facto purposes is between the 2002 edition and the 2001 edition. As it turns out, the relevant sentencing guidelines did not change between those two years. Therefore, Cruzado is right that he should have been sentenced under the 2002 guidelines, and the court, misled by the PSR, plainly erred in applying the 2000 guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Reasons for remanding</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arguably, we could continue our analysis to see if Cruzado was prejudiced by the application of the 2000 guidelines. <i>See United States v. Sedoma,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200501\"><a href=\"/opinion/200501/united-states-v-sedoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">332</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 28 (1st Cir.2003) (reviewing a sentence for plain error). That analysis might reveal that a sentence under the 2002 guidelines would involve the same guidelines range as the 2000 guidelines. On the other hand, Cruzado argues that he would receive a lower sentence under the 2002 guidelines, while the government and the district court believe that he would receive a higher sentence. For two reasons, however, we decline to undertake such an analysis here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, between the 2000 and 2002 editions, the sentencing commission introduced a major change in the way that sentences for money laundering are calculated. The 2000 guidelines simply gave a fixed number as the base offense level for money laundering. The 2002 guidelines take a more complicated approach by incorporating the offense level of the underlying offense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Sentencing under that new regime might involve factual disputes or legal issues which the district court has not yet had an opportunity to address. If we were to explore this uncharted territory ourselves, we, in effect, would be doing the sentencing rather than the district court. That is not an appropriate allocation of functions. <i>See Koon v.

That legal development injects even more uncertainty into an attempt by us to reconstruct a sentencing decision by the district court under the 2002 guidelines.
