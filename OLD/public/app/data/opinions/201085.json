Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                         Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n                John R. Gibson,* Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                      and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Mary A. Davis with whom Tisdale & Davis, P.A. was on brief,\nfor appellant.\n     Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, with whom Paula D.\nSilsby, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.\n\n\n                            June 28, 2004\n\n\n\n\n    *\n        Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f               Per Curiam.   Patrick Mazzillo appeals the revocation of\n\nhis   supervised     release     and    resulting      imprisonment.       Mazzillo\n\npleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess heroin with the intent to\n\ndistribute and was sentenced to eight months in prison and three\n\nyears    of    supervised    release.          One   condition    for    Mazzillo's\n\nsupervised release was that he not engage in criminal conduct. The\n\ndistrict court found that Mazzillo violated this condition by\n\npossessing controlled substances.              As a result, the court revoked\n\nhis supervised release and sentenced him to an additional eight\n\nmonths    of    imprisonment.          The   court     also    ordered   that   upon\n\nMazzillo's \"release from imprisonment, [his] term of supervised\n\nrelease shall be terminated.\"            Bureau of Prisons records indicate\n\nthat Mazzillo completed serving his sentence on March 29, 2004.\n\nThis case was argued and taken under advisement by this court on\n\nApril 6, 2004.\n\n               Based on these facts, we questioned our jurisdiction to\n\ndecide this appeal because the question of the propriety of the\n\nrevocation order appeared moot.              See Matos v. Clinton Sch. Dist.,\n\n367   F.3d     68,   72   (1st   Cir.    2004)       (\"[A]    cognizable   case   or\n\ncontroversy must exist not merely at the time an appeal is taken,\n\nbut at all subsequent stages of appellate review.\"); García-\n\nVelazquez v. Frito Lay Snacks Carribean, 358 F.3d 6, 8 (1st Cir.\n\n2004) (stating that an appellate court has an obligation to satisfy\n\nitself of jurisdiction in every case). We ordered Mazzillo to show\n\n                                         -2-\n\fcause why we shouldn’t conclude that a live controversy no longer\n\nexisted.   Mazzillo responded that under prevailing case law his\n\nappeal was moot but asked us nevertheless to consider the appeal\n\nunder the rule that courts may review otherwise moot cases where\n\nthe issue is capable of repetition but will evade review.                      See S.\n\nPac. Terminal Co. v. ICC, 219 U.S. 498, 514 (1911).                We decline the\n\ninvitation. An appeal from an order revoking supervised release is\n\nordinarily moot if the sentence is completed before the appeal is\n\ndecided.   See Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U.S. 1, 18 (1998) (declaring\n\nmoot a challenge to an allegedly erroneous parole revocation\n\nbecause the defendant had already served his entire sentence);\n\nUnited   States   v.    Myers,     200    F.3d   715,    723    (10th   Cir.   2000)\n\n(declaring moot a challenge to a revocation of supervised release\n\nwhere the defendant completed the term of imprisonment resulting\n\nfrom the revocation); United States v. Clark, 193 F.3d 845, 847-48\n\n(5th Cir. 1999) (per curiam) (applying Spencer to dismiss as moot\n\na   challenge    to    the   district     court's      extension   of     supervised\n\nrelease); United States v. Probber, 170 F.3d 345, 348-49 (2d Cir.\n\n1999) (applying Spencer and dismissing as moot a challenge to the\n\ndistrict   court's      revocation       of   supervised      release).     Because\n\nMazzillo does not dispute that he has completed his sentence and\n\nhas   provided    no    adequate    legal      basis    for    distinguishing     or\n\ndeparting from the cited authority, his appeal is moot.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\f            Mazzillo's claim does not fall within the exception to\n\nthe mootness doctrine for cases that are capable of repetition but\n\nwill evade review.       This doctrine is reserved for cases in which\n\nthe party asking the court to exercise jurisdiction can demonstrate\n\nthat \"(1) the challenged action is in its duration too short to be\n\nfully litigated prior to cessation or expiration, and (2) there is\n\na reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be\n\nsubject to the same action again.\"              United States v. Reid,\n\n--F.3d--,    2004   WL   1197360   (1st        Cir.   May   27,     2004)    (quoting\n\nSpencer, 523 U.S. at 17).          Mazzillo's claim fails this second\n\nprong because there is no reason to expect that he will again face\n\nthe revocation of a supervised release period.\n\n            The Supreme Court addressed a similar claim in Weinstein\n\nv. Bradford, 423 U.S. 147, 149 (1975) (per curiam).                         There, a\n\nprisoner sued the North Carolina Board of Parole concerning the\n\nprocedures by which the Board granted parole requests. Id. at 147.\n\nWhile the appeal was pending, the prisoner was granted parole,\n\nthereby   mooting    the   case.         The    Supreme     Court    rejected       the\n\nprisoner's    argument     that    his     appeal      nevertheless         could   be\n\nconsidered under \"the capable of repetition, yet evading review\"\n\nexception because there was \"no demonstrated probability that the\n\nrespondent\" would again be eligible for parole.                       Id. at 419.\n\nSimilarly, Mazzillo has not demonstrated that he will ever be in\n\nthe position of challenging an order revoking his supervised\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\frelease.1   See Arnold v. Panora, 593 F.2d 161, 164 (1st Cir. 1979)\n\n(stating that case does not fall within second Weinstein exception\n\nwhere there was no evidence that party again would be arrested).\n\nThe \"capable of repetition, yet evading review\" exception therefore\n\ndoes not provide a basis for jurisdiction.\n\n            Dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       We note also that it was not a foregone conclusion that\nMazzillo's sentence would have expired before we could have decided\nhis appeal. He could have moved to stay the imposition of sentence\npending appeal and/or moved for expedited consideration of his\nappeal. He did neither.\n\n                                -5-\n\f",

There, a prisoner sued the North Carolina Board of Parole concerning the procedures by which the Board granted parole requests. <i>Id.</i> at 147, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109338\"><a href=\"/opinion/109338/weinstein-v-bradford/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Supreme Court rejected the prisoner's argument that his appeal nevertheless could be considered under \"the capable of repetition, yet evading review\" exception because there was \"no demonstrated probability that the respondent\" would again be eligible for parole. <i>Id.</i> at 149, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109338\"><a href=\"/opinion/109338/weinstein-v-bradford/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
