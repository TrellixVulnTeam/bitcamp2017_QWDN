Saris, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                          Lynch, Chief Judge,\n                  Boudin and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Gordon W. Spencer with whom Carol Mallory was on brief for\nappellant.\n     Michael A. Rotker, Attorney, U.S. Department of Justice,\nwith whom Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, and\nTheodore B. Heinrich, Assistant United States Attorney, were on\nbrief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           August 21, 2008\n\f            LYNCH, Chief Judge.      A decade ago there were a series of\n\nshootings and murders involving two warring Cape Verdean youth\n\ngangs, Stonehurst and Wendover, in Boston and in Brockton, a\n\nneighboring community.        Federal prosecutions ensued under the\n\nRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations statute (\"RICO\"), 18\n\nU.S.C. §§ 1961-68, and the Violent Crimes in Aid of Racketeering\n\nstatute   (\"VICAR\"),   18   U.S.C.    §    1959.   See    United   States    v.\n\nNascimento, 491 F.3d 25 (1st Cir. 2007) (affirming RICO, VICAR, and\n\nfirearms violations convictions of three Stonehurst members). This\n\ncase, against Angelo Brandao, was one of those prosecutions.                The\n\nindictment charged Brandao, who was eighteen at the time, with\n\nconspiracy to commit the 1999 murder of a high school student,\n\nDinho Fernandes, and the shootings of Alcides Depina and Antonio\n\nDias.\n\n            Angelo Brandao appeals his conviction on four RICO counts\n\nand one VICAR count.   The appeal requires us to consider two issues\n\nof particular note.    One concerns the content of the \"associated\n\nwith,\"    \"relatedness,\"    and   \"pattern    of   racketeering    activity\"\n\nelements of RICO.      Brandao challenges the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence that the government presented at trial on each of these\n\nelements.    The second concerns a constructive amendment of the\n\nindictment via the jury instructions and the standard of prejudice\n\nthat will be applied to his unpreserved claim of error.            That issue\n\nis the subject of a split among the circuits.            We affirm Brandao's\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fconviction and sentence, acknowledging the able advocacy by defense\n\ncounsel.\n\n                                   I.\n\n            Brandao's numerous attacks on the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence require an extensive discussion of the facts of the case.\n\nThose facts are taken in the light most favorable to the verdict.\n\nUnited States v. DeCologero, 530 F.3d 36, 47 (1st Cir. 2008).         We\n\nalso account for defense theories in analyzing the permissible\n\ninferences from the evidence.\n\nA.          Stonehurst-Wendover Feud\n\n            In the early 1990s, Augusto \"Gus\" Lopes, his younger\n\nbrother Nardo Lopes, and Bobby Mendes belonged to a group whose\n\nactivities    centered   around   Wendover    Street   in   the   Roxbury\n\nneighborhood of Boston.    In 1995, Nardo Lopes was charged with the\n\nmurder of Mendes and fled Boston.       Gus Lopes, who was in prison at\n\nthe time of the killing, vowed to eliminate any potential witnesses\n\nto his brother's crime and to exact revenge on members of the\n\nWendover group who remained sympathetic to Mendes and who harassed\n\nLopes's relatives.\n\n            After his release from prison, Gus Lopes became close to\n\nAmando \"Manny\" Monteiro.    Monteiro is the cousin of the defendant\n\nhere.      In 1997, Monteiro introduced Lopes to others who had\n\npreexisting antagonisms with the Wendover group. Lopes joined this\n\nStonehurst group, named after Stonehurst Street in the Dorchester\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fneighborhood.     Lopes and Monteiro became leaders of the Stonehurst\n\ngroup and led Stonehurst members on numerous \"missions\" to hunt\n\ndown and shoot members of Wendover.          Wendover members did the same\n\nas to Stonehurst. The Stonehurst-Wendover shootings reached their\n\napex in the period from June 1998 to July 2000.\n\nB.         Dinho Fernandes Murder\n\n           A relatively trivial dispute between classmates at a\n\nBrockton high school on the morning of March 17, 1999 started a\n\nsequence of events which led to the death of one of the students,\n\nDinho Fernandes.       The dispute continued after school ended and a\n\nscuffle followed, involving Fernandes and Adalberto Barros at\n\nBarros's home.      Defendant Brandao was there to support Barros.\n\nBoth defendant and Barros were cousins of Manny Monteiro.\n\n           Later that day, Lopes and Monteiro were at work at a gas\n\nstation in Brookline, Massachusetts when Monteiro received a page\n\non his beeper around 4:00pm.       After answering the page, Monteiro\n\nasked to borrow Lopes's car and told Lopes that a \"family member\"\n\nwas \"having problems\" in Brockton.           Lopes never knew who made the\n\ncall.   The defense theory was that the call came from Barros, not\n\nthe defendant.      Lopes offered to drive Monteiro to Brockton in\n\nLopes's rental car, a bright red Dodge Stratus. Lopes and Monteiro\n\nstopped   twice   en   route,   first   at    Monteiro's   house,   then   in\n\nRandolph, Massachusetts to pick up Louis Rodrigues, another member\n\nof Stonehurst.     Lopes explained to Rodrigues that they were going\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fto Brockton \"to check out Manny's cousin.\"    The trio then drove to\n\nBrandao's home in Brockton.   There was no evidence about the prior\n\nrelationship between Brandao and his cousin Manny Monteiro.\n\n          Shortly after the Stonehurst members arrived, a blue\n\nHonda occupied by Brandao and an unidentified male pulled up behind\n\nthe Dodge.   Although Brandao was Monteiro's cousin, this was the\n\nfirst time Monteiro's friend Lopes ever saw Brandao.      The Dodge\n\nfollowed the Honda to nearby Hunt Street, where Brandao pointed out\n\nthe window of the Honda toward three teenagers standing on the\n\ncorner who appeared to be of Cape Verdean descent.    In the Dodge,\n\nLopes directed Monteiro and Rodrigues to \"blaze them.\"       At the\n\ntime, none of the three Stonehurst members were armed so they\n\nneeded to get a weapon.\n\n          Both cars returned to Brandao's home, which Monteiro\n\nentered briefly before returning to the Dodge.        There was no\n\nevidence on whether Brandao entered the house as well.    The Dodge\n\nthen followed the Honda back toward Hunt Street.        Before they\n\narrived, Rodrigues motioned for the Honda to pull over, and both\n\ncars stopped by the side of the road.        Brandao got out of the\n\nHonda, and handed Monteiro, in the Dodge, a 9mm handgun.    Brandao\n\nreturned to the Honda, and the cars again drove toward Hunt Street.\n\n          When Lopes spotted the teenagers Brandao had identified,\n\nMonteiro fired at them from the back window of the Dodge, emptying\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\fhis clip.     Two of the teenagers were seriously wounded, and\n\nanother, Dinho Fernandes, died on the scene.\n\n            After    the   shooting,    Lopes,   Monteiro,   and   Rodrigues\n\nreturned to Brandao's house. Monteiro went into the house with the\n\nshooting weapon and came out unarmed. The weapon, a 9mm handgun,\n\nhad been used in earlier Stonehurst shootings before Brandao handed\n\nit to Monteiro.\n\nC.          Antonio Dias Shooting\n\n            Within   days   of   the   Fernandes   murder,   Brandao   began\n\ncommuting between Brockton and Boston to meet with Lopes and help\n\nhim hunt down Wendover members.         Among Lopes's targets were Jimmy\n\nGomes and Antonio Dias.      Lopes went on about half a dozen missions\n\nto Brockton to look for Gomes and Dias between 1998 and 2000.\n\nAlthough Gomes and Dias were not members of Wendover, they had\n\ntaken the side of a Wendover member in a dispute between him and\n\nJohn and Mario DeSoto.       The DeSotos were friends of Lopes as well\n\nas Brandao's cousins.\n\n            On April 27, 1999, Lopes, Brandao, and Stonehurst member\n\nValdir Fernandes spotted Dias in Brockton during one of their\n\nmissions.    Lopes and Brandao lay in wait for Dias outside of a\n\nhouse.    When Dias emerged, Lopes and Brandao fired repeatedly at\n\nDias.    The bullets damaged Dias's car, but Dias escaped unharmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fD.           Alcides Depina Shooting\n\n             On the night of May 14, 1999, Jimmy Gomes's brother\n\nAlcides Depina was walking towards Gomes's home in Brockton when he\n\nnoticed an Acura driving slowly towards him with its lights off.\n\nA man in a blue jogging suit emerged from the passenger side of the\n\ncar and ran towards Depina.    As Depina ran away, he saw a red beam\n\nshining over his shoulder and heard multiple gunshots.        Depina\n\nmanaged to reach Gomes's house safely, and the shooter ran back\n\ntowards the car.\n\n             Within minutes, the police responded to calls about the\n\nshooting and detained a black Acura at a nearby gas station.\n\nPolice officers took Depina to the gas station to make a field\n\nidentification.      There, Depina confirmed that the police had\n\ndetained the black Acura and the man in the blue track suit that\n\nhad earlier chased him.    The man in the track suit turned out to be\n\nStonehurst member Manuel \"J\" Lopes.      Depina also identified the\n\ndriver of the vehicle as Angelo Brandao, whom he knew because their\n\nmothers were acquainted.\n\n             Police arrested Brandao and Manuel Lopes and impounded\n\nthe Acura.    A police officer conducting an inventory search of the\n\ncar at the station house discovered a 9mm Ruger with an attached\n\nlaser sight concealed behind a panel in the glove compartment. The\n\ngun was loaded and the safety was off.     Three ballisticians later\n\ndetermined that the gun had been used in the Depina shooting, the\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fDias shooting, and another shooting in which two Stonehurst members\n\nattacked a Wendover member.\n\nE.          Station House Interview\n\n            Police took Brandao, after his arrest, to the Brockton\n\npolice station for questioning in the early morning hours of May\n\n15, 1999, directly following the Depina shooting.               Once at the\n\nstation house, Brandao asked for Massachusetts State Trooper John\n\nDuggan by name.      Duggan had previously met with and questioned\n\nBrandao during the course of his investigation of the Fernandes\n\nmurder.    Brandao signed a waiver of his Miranda rights, and Duggan\n\nand Detective Mark Reardon of the Brockton Police Department began\n\ninterrogating Brandao at 3:15am.\n\n            Brandao appeared calm at first, but when Duggan told\n\nBrandao that the police had located the car used in the Fernandes\n\nshooting and had a witness who identified the people in the car,\n\nBrandao became visibly agitated.         Brandao's eyes welled up and he\n\nput his head on the table.       Brandao asked Duggan, \"Is that the car\n\nthat was in the paper?\"      Early media accounts of the Fernandes\n\nmurder had reported that the shooters drove a red Honda.              When the\n\npolice later learned that the car was in fact a red Dodge, they\n\nwithheld    that   information    from    the   press   to   test    suspects'\n\nknowledge.   When Duggan answered Brandao that it was not the car in\n\nthe papers, Brandao again put his head on the table.           Brandao asked\n\nDuggan, \"What am I looking at, twenty-five to life?                 I can't do\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fthat time.    Even if I tell you what happened, I'm still looking at\n\ntime.\"\n\n             When Duggan mentioned Gus Lopes in connection with the\n\nFernandes shooting, Brandao replied, \"I guess there's nothing left\n\nfor me to do.\"    He then said that he would tell Duggan the details\n\nof the whole story at some point, although he never did.\n\n             In July 2000, after years of orchestrating gang warfare,\n\nGus Lopes was arrested when he attempted to buy guns from an\n\nundercover police officer.       Lopes agreed to cooperate in the\n\ngovernment's prosecution of fellow Stonehurst members in exchange\n\nfor a reduced sentence on the firearms charge.\n\n                                  II.\n\n             On September 30, 2004, a federal grand jury delivered a\n\nsuperseding indictment charging Brandao and twelve others with\n\nmultiple counts of RICO, VICAR, and firearms violations.         The\n\nindictment alleged that Stonehurst was a RICO enterprise, the\n\nactivities of which affected interstate commerce.     The indictment\n\nimputed multiple purposes to the Stonehurst enterprise, including\n\n\"to shoot and kill members, associates, and perceived supporters of\n\n. . . Wendover\" and \"to protect and defend its members and\n\nassociates from acts and threats of violence and to shoot and kill\n\n\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fother people with whom members and associates of the Enterprise\n\nwere engaged in violent or drug-related disputes.\"1\n\n            The   indictment   named   Brandao   individually   in   eight\n\ncounts.    The first two counts were for racketeering, see 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1962(c), and racketeering conspiracy, see id. § 1962(d), both in\n\nviolation of RICO.     The indictment named Brandao in four specific\n\nacts as predicates to the racketeering charge:        (1) conspiracy to\n\nmurder members of Wendover (racketeering Act One); (2) assault with\n\nintent to murder Antonio Dias (racketeering Act Ten); (3) assault\n\nwith intent to murder Alcides Depina (racketeering Act Eleven); and\n\n(4) conspiracy to murder Dinho Fernandes (racketeering Act Twenty).\n\n            The indictment also charged Brandao under VICAR, see id.\n\n§ 1959(a), for committing each of these four violent criminal acts\n\nin aid of racketeering.        The indictment characterized the Dinho\n\nFernandes shooting differently for purposes of the RICO and VICAR\n\ncharges.    While the indictment treated the shooting as \"Murder in\n\nAid of Racketeering\" (emphasis added) for the VICAR charge, the\n\nsame activity was described as \"conspir[acy] to murder Dinho\n\nFernandes\"    (emphasis   added)   for    purposes   of   establishing   a\n\npredicate act under RICO.       Finally, Brandao was charged under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 924(c) for use of a firearm during the Dias and Depina\n\nshootings.\n\n\n     1\n          The indictment also alleged that Stonehurst's activities\nencompassed the sale of crack and marijuana, but the government\nabandoned those charges before Brandao's trial.\n\n                                   -10-\n\f              The   district   court   divided    the    thirteen   Stonehurst\n\ndefendants into groups for trial.             The connections of the first\n\ngroup of defendants are described in Nascimento, 491 F.3d at 30.\n\nBrandao was tried later with one co-defendant, Brima Wurie, who was\n\nacquitted.     On February 9, 2006, following a fourteen-day trial, a\n\njury convicted Brandao on the substantive RICO and RICO conspiracy\n\ncharges.      The jury also convicted Brandao on the VICAR charge of\n\nassault in aid of racketeering based on the Depina shooting and the\n\nassociated firearms charge.\n\n              With respect to the substantive RICO charge, the jury\n\nreturned special findings that the prosecution had proven beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that Brandao had assaulted Alcides Depina with\n\nintent to murder him (racketeering Act Eleven) and conspired to\n\nmurder Dinho Fernandes (racketeering Act Twenty).              The jury found\n\nthat the prosecution had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that\n\nBrandao either conspired to murder Wendover members (racketeering\n\nAct One) or assaulted Antonio Dias with intent to murder him\n\n(racketeering Act Ten).\n\n              Brandao submitted a motion for acquittal or for a new\n\ntrial, which the district court denied in a published opinion on\n\nSeptember 8, 2006.       United States v. Brandao, 448 F. Supp. 2d 311\n\n(D.   Mass.    2006).    On    December   13,    2006,   the   district   court\n\nsentenced Brandao to 213 months' imprisonment for the RICO and\n\n\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fVICAR convictions, to be followed by 120 months' imprisonment for\n\nthe firearms violation.              Brandao timely appealed.\n\n                                            III.\n\nA.           Sufficiency        of    the    Evidence       as    to    RICO      and   VICAR\n             Convictions\n\n             Brandao        disputes     the   sufficiency             of   the    evidence\n\npresented at trial to support each charge of conviction. We review\n\nthe    record     de   novo    and    affirm   the     jury's      conclusions          if   we\n\nconclude, after looking at all the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to the prosecution, and taking all reasonable inferences\n\nin its favor, that a rational fact finder could find, beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt, that the prosecution successfully proved the\n\nessential elements of the crime.                   United States v. Connolly, 341\n\nF.3d 16, 22 (1st Cir. 2003); see also United States v. Boulerice,\n\n325 F.3d 75, 79 (1st Cir. 2003).                   Our inquiry pays \"considerable\n\ndeference to a jury's assessment of the evidence,\" and \"we will\n\nreverse only if the verdict is irrational.\"                      Connolly, 341 F.3d at\n\n22.\n\n             1.        Substantive RICO\n\n             For a defendant to be convicted of a substantive RICO\n\nviolation, the government must prove the following elements beyond\n\na reasonable doubt: (1) the existence of an enterprise (2) that\n\naffected interstate commerce; and (3) that the defendant was\n\nassociated with the enterprise; (4) and conducted or participated\n\nin    the   conduct    of     the    enterprise;      (5)    through        a   pattern      of\n\n                                            -12-\n\fracketeering activity.         Nascimento, 491 F.3d at 31; United States\n\nv. Marino, 277 F.3d 11, 33 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n              The first two elements are not contested.         Indeed, in an\n\nearlier appeal, this court affirmed jury verdicts that Stonehurst\n\nconstituted an enterprise and was one that affected interstate\n\ncommerce.      See Nascimento, 491 F.3d at 45; see also United States\n\nv. Patrick, 248 F.3d 11, 19 (1st Cir. 2001) (youth street gang in\n\nBoston was RICO enterprise).\n\n              Brandao's appeal from RICO convictions focuses on the\n\ndetails of his involvement with Stonehurst in three respects.\n\nFirst,   he    argues   that    the   government    presented   insufficient\n\nevidence that he was \"associated with\" Stonehurst at any time\n\nbefore   the    Dinho   Fernandes     murder.      Specifically,   there   was\n\ninsufficient evidence Brandao had sufficient knowledge there was a\n\nStonehurst gang or that his cousin, Monteiro, was a member of the\n\ngang, in order for him to have been associated with Stonehurst at\n\nthe time of Fernandes's murder.         He concedes the evidence supports\n\nan inference that Brandao knew his cousin had a propensity to\n\ncommit violent crimes, but not that Monteiro's criminality was part\n\nof his gang affiliation with Stonehurst.\n\n              Second, he argues the evidence did not support the jury's\n\nfinding that the Fernandes murder was a purpose or affair of the\n\nStonehurst gang, as opposed to a purely personal dispute.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\f           Third, Brandao argues that the evidence does not support\n\nthe   conclusion   that   the   Dinho   Fernandes   and   Alcides   Depina\n\nshootings constituted a \"pattern of racketeering activity.\"\n\n           a. Association2 -- In order to establish a substantive\n\nRICO violation, the prosecution had to prove that Brandao was\n\n\"associated with\" Stonehurst at the time that he committed the\n\npredicate racketeering acts.        The murder of Fernandes is the\n\npredicate act which concerns us.        The government does not contend\n\nthat Brandao was associated with Stonehurst before March 17, 1999,\n\nbut that he became associated with it by his actions that day.        The\n\nevidence of defendant's association with Stonehurst after Fernandes\n\nwas killed for the remaining shootings which are predicate acts\n\ncannot be seriously questioned.\n\n           Some knowledge of the enterprise is necessary as part of\n\nthe requirement of showing association with the enterprise.          \"The\n\nRICO net is woven tightly to trap even the smallest fish, those\n\nperipherally involved with the enterprise.\" Marino, 277 F.3d at 33\n\n\n      2\n          There is no claim the jury was not properly instructed.\nThe jury instruction here was:\n          A person is associated with an enterprise if\n          he   knowingly   participates,  directly   or\n          indirectly, in the conduct of the affairs of\n          an enterprise. One need not have an official\n          position in the enterprise to be associated\n          with it. One need not formally align himself\n          with an enterprise to associate with it.\n          Association may be by means of an informal or\n          a loose relationship. Mere presence, however,\n          is not enough.\nThe requirement of association with the enterprise is not strict.\n\n                                   -14-\n\f(quoting United States v. Elliott, 571 F.2d 880, 903 (5th Cir.\n\n1978)) (internal quotation marks omitted). \"The RICO statute seeks\n\nto encompass those people who are 'merely associated with' the\n\nenterprise.\"   Id. (quoting Elliott, 571 F.2d at 903).   As we held\n\nin Marino, \"[t]he defendant need only be 'aware of at least the\n\ngeneral existence of the enterprise named in the indictment,'\" id.\n\n(quoting United States v. Console, 13 F.3d 641, 653 (3d Cir.\n\n1993)), \"and know about its related activities,\" id. (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Martino, 648 F.2d 367, 394 (5th Cir. 1981).\n\n           As the Fifth Circuit noted some time ago, the point of\n\nmaking the government show that the defendants have some knowledge\n\nof the nature of the enterprises is to avoid an unjust association\n\nof the defendant with the crimes of others.      United States v.\n\nManzella, 782 F.2d 533, 538 (5th Cir. 1986); see also Elliott, 571\n\nF.2d at 903.\n\n           In essence, Brandao's claim is that the prosecution\n\nfailed to introduce any direct evidence that Brandao knew his\n\ncousin Monteiro was a member of Stonehurst or even what Stonehurst\n\nwas.   Absent such direct evidence, Brandao argues, the inferences\n\nof knowledge from the other evidence are equally balanced and\n\ncannot constitute proof beyond a reasonable doubt. See United\n\nStates v. Morillo, 158 F.3d 18, 22 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"[W]here an\n\nequal or nearly equal theory of guilt and a theory of innocence is\n\nsupported by the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the\n\n\n                               -15-\n\fprosecution,    'a    reasonable   jury       must   necessarily    entertain     a\n\nreasonable doubt.'\" (quoting United States v. Flores-Rivera, 56\n\nF.3d 319, 323 (1st Cir. 1995)) (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\nWe conclude a rational jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt\n\nthat Brandao had the requisite knowledge, and that the inferences\n\nwere far from equally balanced.          Nascimento, 491 F.3d at 47.\n\n            Brandao makes much of the fact that no direct testimony\n\nat trial explicitly named Brandao as the party who paged Monteiro\n\nat the gas station on the afternoon of the Fernandes murder.                    The\n\nargument is not a strong one.          Even if some individual other than\n\nBrandao    actually    spoke    with    Monteiro      on   the    phone,   it    is\n\nuncontested that as a result of that conversation, Monteiro went to\n\nBrockton to help a cousin of his, and that they went to the home of\n\nBrandao, a cousin of Monteiro's.          They did not go to the home of\n\nBarros, whom defendant argues paged Monteiro.\n\n            Brandao and Monteiro acted together.            Brandao joined his\n\ncousin    Monteiro    at   Brandao's    home    in   a   Honda,   and   then    led\n\nMonteiro's car to the intended victims, where Brandao pointed out\n\nthe victims.    The two cars returned to Brandao's home, then back\n\ntoward where the victims were.           Before reaching the victims, the\n\ntwo cars stopped, and Brandao got out and handed the murder weapon\n\nto his cousin Monteiro.        Brandao returned to his home.            After the\n\nshooting, Monteiro returned to Brandao's home and left the home\n\nunarmed.    This is very strong evidence that Brandao instigated\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\fMonteiro's   trip,   and    the   purpose    of    the   trip     was   to    murder\n\nFernandes.\n\n            As Brandao concedes, the jury had ample cause to find\n\nthat Brandao knew that Monteiro was prone to commit violent crimes.\n\nBrandao did not object or pose any questions when Monteiro brought\n\ntwo other men along to assist in the shooting.             The very lack of a\n\nneed for communication between Brandao and his three fellow gang\n\nmembers is strong evidence of familiarity and common purposes.\n\nThat evidence alone, however, might not be sufficient itself to\n\nshow beyond a reasonable doubt that Brandao knew that his cousin\n\nwas a member of Stonehurst, and that by enlisting Monteiro, Brandao\n\nwas enlisting Stonehurst, the RICO enterprise.\n\n            On all of the evidence, a jury could infer beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that Brandao knew that Monteiro, Lopes, and\n\nRodrigues belonged to the Stonehurst group, and that their group\n\nregularly engaged in shootings of rival gang members. Monteiro and\n\nLopes were gang leaders; leaders are frequently known by name. The\n\nmurder of Bobby Mendes and the ensuing conflict between Stonehurst\n\nand   Wendover   affected    many   members       of   Boston's    Cape      Verdean\n\ncommunity.   Further, Brandao was a cousin to the DeSoto brothers,\n\nwho were embroiled in a separate dispute with a prominent member of\n\nWendover.     Ironically,     another   of    Brandao's         cousins,     Gelson\n\nBrandao, was known to associate with Wendover and was targeted by\n\nStonehurst members, further supporting the inference of Brandao's\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fknowledge of the two gangs and who was a member of which.                     The\n\nvictim was a member of the Cape Verdean community, as was Brandao.\n\nThat makes it unlikely Brandao did not know of Stonehurst or\n\nMonteiro's association with it.\n\n             Brandao argues he lived in Brockton and not in the\n\ngeographic center of the Stonehurst and Wendover groups, which was\n\nin the Dorchester and Roxbury neighborhoods of Boston.                    But the\n\njury heard evidence that Gus Lopes and other Stonehurst members\n\nrepeatedly traveled to Brockton on missions in search of rivals to\n\nshoot.\n\n             The evidence of knowledge goes well beyond the fact that\n\nBrandao may have known of Monteiro's relationship with Stonehurst\n\nmerely because they were cousins.               It is unlikely that when\n\ncommissioning      a   shooting   by   his    cousin,     Brandao   was   unaware\n\nMonteiro's expertise in shooting people came from his being a\n\nStonehurst member.\n\n             The jury could also reach its conclusion based on the\n\nfact that the gun used to kill Fernandes was a gun which had been\n\nused in earlier Stonehurst shootings, and that Brandao had the gun.\n\nAt trial, Gus Lopes testified that he recognized the gun when\n\nBrandao handed it to Monteiro.          In fact, Lopes knew the gun to be\n\none   that   had   been   used    in   at   least   two   previous   Stonehurst\n\nshootings.      Police later found the same gun during a search\n\nincident to the arrest of Stonehurst member Jackson Nascimento.\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\f           The jury could reasonably infer that this network of\n\npersonal and family ties and the possession of a gang gun would put\n\nBrandao on notice of Stonehurst's \"general existence\" and \"related\n\nactivities.\"\n\n           b. Relationship of Fernandes Shooting to Stonehurst --\n\nBrandao argues that the prosecution failed to produce sufficient\n\nevidence   of   relatedness    between     the    Fernandes     murder    and\n\nStonehurst's purposes or affairs to be \"through\" a pattern of\n\nracketeering    activities.     The   prosecution    must   prove   Brandao\n\nparticipated    in   Stonehurst's     affairs    \"through   a   pattern   of\n\nracketeering activity.\" 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). The statute's use of\n\nthe word \"through\" implies \"a nexus between these racketeering acts\n\nand the enterprise.\"     Nascimento, 491 F.3d at 45.          \"A sufficient\n\nnexus or relationship exists between the racketeering acts and the\n\nenterprise if the defendant was able to commit the predicate acts\n\nby means of, by consequence of, by reason of, by the agency of, or\n\nby the instrumentality of his association with the enterprise.\"\n\nMarino, 277 F.3d at 27.\n\n           The jury could reasonably find that the evidence in this\n\ncase fulfills the test.       Brandao did not himself fire the shots\n\nwhich killed Fernandes. Instead, he sought the assistance of three\n\nmembers of Stonehurst who were well-rehearsed in the techniques of\n\ndrive-by shootings.      Brandao quite literally conspired to kill\n\n\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\fFernandes \"by the agency of\" and \"by the instrumentality of his\n\nassociation with\" three members of Stonehurst.\n\n            If that were not enough, the \"nexus or relationship\" test\n\nmay be met by proof that \"the resources, property, or facilities of\n\nthe enterprise are used by the defendant to commit the predicate\n\nacts.\"   Id. at 28.       The gun used to kill Fernandes was such a\n\nresource.    The gun that killed Fernandes passed from the ownership\n\nand control of Stonehurst members to Brandao and back again.\n\nEvidence that a gun shared amongst Stonehurst members killed\n\nFernandes could permit a rational jury to find a relationship\n\nbetween the shooting and Stonehurst itself.\n\n            Brandao mounts a similar attack based on the third\n\nelement of RICO culpability requiring that a defendant participate\n\nin the conduct of the enterprise's affairs. Brandao cites Reves v.\n\nErnst & Young, 507 U.S. 170 (1993), for the proposition that\n\nliability under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) \"depends on showing that the\n\ndefendants    conducted    or   participated   in   the   conduct   of   the\n\n'enterprise's affairs,' not just their own affairs.\"          Id. at 185.\n\nBrandao interprets this language as foreclosing RICO liability for\n\npredicate acts undertaken for personal motivations.\n\n            The argument takes Reves out of context.          At issue in\n\nReves was the liability of an outside accounting firm with a mere\n\ncontractual relationship with the corrupt enterprise.          See id. at\n\n186.   Cases involving \"outsiders\" to the enterprise as defendants\n\n\n                                   -20-\n\fare   different    from   those   involving       \"insiders\"    as   defendants.\n\nUnited States v. Houlihan, 92 F.3d 1271, 1298-99 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\nInsiders     --   those    \"who   are     integral    to     carrying   out   the\n\nenterprise's racketeering activities\" -- by definition participate\n\nin the conduct of the enterprise.              Id. at 1299.\n\n           The jury in this case heard evidence that the Fernandes\n\nshooting   was    related   to    Stonehurst's       affairs.     The   criminal\n\nenterprise    here   had     particularly        malleable     purposes.      The\n\nindictment defined that purpose in part as being \"to shoot and kill\n\nother people with whom members and associates of [Stonehurst] were\n\nengaged in violent or drug-related disputes.\"              The jury rationally\n\ncould have concluded that the purpose of the murder of Fernandes\n\nwas to kill someone with whom an associate of Stonehurst had a\n\nviolent dispute.\n\n           When asked why he participated in the Fernandes shooting,\n\nGus Lopes testified, \"Because Manny was my boy, and that's his\n\ncousin, and I'm going to help Manny with whatever problem he's\n\ngot.\"   The jury could have interpreted this statement as a simple\n\nexpression of personal loyalty, but also could have concluded\n\notherwise.     The other evidence supported an inference that Lopes\n\nwas motivated by a desire for a quid pro quo that would benefit\n\nStonehurst's interests and further the campaign against Wendover.\n\nMarcelino Rodrigues, a Stonehurst member who was incarcerated in\n\nmid-1999, testified that Gus Lopes visited him in prison and told\n\n\n                                        -21-\n\fhim   about    his   new   acquaintance,    Angelo    Brandao.     Lopes   told\n\nRodrigues that \"they both did favors for each other,\" with Lopes\n\noperating in Boston and Brandao reciprocating in Brockton.                 That\n\ntestimony     was    consistent   with   Lopes's     assertion   that   Brandao\n\n\"became part of Stonehurst\" on the occasion of the Fernandes\n\nshooting.\n\n              c. Pattern of Racketeering Activity -- Brandao next\n\nargues that the prosecution presented insufficient evidence of a\n\n\"pattern\" of racketeering activity on his part.            A RICO conviction\n\nrequires proof of \"at least two acts of racketeering activity\" over\n\na period of ten years.3        18 U.S.C. § 1961(5).        More than numbers\n\nare required to establish a \"pattern\" of racketeering acts. \"It is\n\nnot the number of predicates but the relationship that they bear to\n\neach other or to some external organizing principle that renders\n\nthem\" a pattern.      H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 238\n\n(1989).     Thus, two or more racketeering predicates constitute a\n\n\"pattern\" if they are (1) \"related\" and (2) \"amount to or pose a\n\nthreat of continued criminal activity.\"            Id. at 239.\n\n              The \"relatedness\" prong may be satisfied by proof that\n\nthe predicate acts \"have the same or similar purposes, results,\n\nparticipants, victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are\n\n\n\n      3\n          There must have been at least two predicate acts in order\nto make out a pattern under RICO. See H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel.\nCo., 492 U.S. 229, 237 (1989); United States v. Cianci, 378 F.3d\n71, 88 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n                                     -22-\n\finterrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated\n\nevents.\"       Id. at 240 (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 3575(e) (repealed 1987))\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).              The standard is intentionally\n\nflexible, id. at 238, and will take into account the nature of the\n\nenterprise.       \"[A] criminal enterprise is more, not less, dangerous\n\nif   it   is    versatile,      flexible,     diverse   in   its   objectives     and\n\ncapabilities.        Versatility, flexibility, and diversity are not\n\ninconsistent with pattern.\"            United States v. Masters, 924 F.2d\n\n1362, 1367 (7th Cir. 1991).\n\n               Stonehurst was a criminal enterprise with purposes broad\n\nenough to include shooting antagonists of the Stonehurst members as\n\na preferred method of resolving conflict.                    The jury could have\n\nreasonably concluded that Brandao and Manuel Lopes targeted Alcides\n\nDepina for his perceived loyalties, however attenuated, to members\n\nof Wendover.\n\n               In addition, both the Fernandes and Depina shootings\n\nshared distinguishing characteristics common to Stonehurst.                      Three\n\nprominent       members    of    the   gang    assisted      Brandao    in    killing\n\nFernandes, while another member accompanied Brandao on the attack\n\nagainst Depina.       Each of those shootings involved guns shared by\n\nStonehurst       members     and   implicated      in     multiple     gang-related\n\nshootings.          Both        incidents      involved      drive-by        shootings\n\ncharacteristic of Stonehurst's \"missions\" to hunt and kill Wendover\n\nrivals.\n\n\n                                        -23-\n\f          Brandao argues, in essence, that the Fernandes and Depina\n\nshootings cannot form a \"pattern\" because they were not directly\n\nrelated to each other.    This argument misses the mark.   Whether\n\nBrandao's motivations for conspiring to kill Dinho Fernandes and\n\nassisting in the assault on Alcides Depina were the same, whether\n\nidentical Stonehurst members accompanied Brandao on both outings,\n\nand whether the same gun or car were used in each attack are not\n\ndispositive.   Rather, the attacks' relatedness to Stonehurst, its\n\npurposes, its members, and its methods provides the \"external\n\norganizing principle\" behind both acts.\n\n          Likewise, there was sufficient evidence for a finding\n\nthat Brandao's participation with Stonehurst posed a \"threat of\n\ncontinued criminal activity.\"\n\n          [T]he threat of continuity may be established\n          by showing that the predicate acts or offenses\n          are part of an ongoing entity's regular way of\n          doing   business.     Thus,   the  threat   of\n          continuity is sufficiently established where\n          the predicates can be attributed to a\n          defendant operating as part of a long-term\n          association that exists for criminal purposes.\n\nH.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 242-43.\n\n          Here, Stonehurst engaged in a long-term campaign of\n\nviolence aimed at killing members of Wendover and other enemies of\n\nStonehurst members.   Once Brandao joined the group, he met with\n\nStonehurst members several times a week with the aim of \"helping\n\n[them] with shootings.\"   The jury found that Brandao participated\n\nin the Depina shooting and heard evidence that he participated in\n\n                                 -24-\n\fthe Dias shooting, acts for which Brandao's only motivation was his\n\nrelationship with Stonehurst.         Once Brandao associated with the\n\nenterprise, his violent activity would continue as long as that\n\nassociation continued.\n\n              2.      RICO Conspiracy\n\n              Brandao argues that there was insufficient evidence to\n\nsupport the RICO conspiracy conviction for all of the reasons given\n\nabove that the substantive RICO conviction must be vacated.             Those\n\narguments fail, as does the argument that there was no agreement to\n\njoin the RICO conspiracy, as we have just held.\n\n              3.      Second VICAR Count\n\n              Brandao alleges there was insufficient evidence to show,\n\nunder the second VICAR count, that his shooting of Alcides Depina,\n\non May 14, 1999, was motivated by a purpose of maintaining or\n\nincreasing his position in Stonehurst.\n\n              VICAR prohibits \"assault with a dangerous weapon\" for\n\n\"the purpose of . . . maintaining or increasing position in an\n\nenterprise engaged in racketeering activity.\" 18 U.S.C. § 1959(a).\n\nThis circuit has defined the motive requirement in VICAR as a\n\ngeneral one, satisfied by proof either that the crime was committed\n\nin furtherance of defendant's membership in the enterprise or\n\nbecause it was expected of him by reason of his membership.            United\n\nStates   v.    Tse,   135   F.3d   200,   206   (1st   Cir.   1998);   accord\n\nNascimento, 491 F.3d at 47.        In light of the congressional purpose\n\n\n                                     -25-\n\fin   VICAR     of   curtailing       violent    activity      associated   with\n\nracketeering enterprises, we rejected a reading that the government\n\nmust prove this was the sole purpose.           Tse, 135 F.3d at 206.\n\n             The government argues there was a basis in the evidence\n\nfor the jury to find either that the crime was committed in\n\nfurtherance of Brandao's membership or that it was expected by him\n\nby reason of his membership.          The defendant argues that his motive\n\nwas personal, and not gang affiliated.           He says Depina was not an\n\nenemy of Stonehurst, and Depina was shot as a result of Brandao's\n\nrelationship with DeSoto, which led to Brandao's dispute with\n\nGomes, which led to the shooting.              Brandao cites to two cases\n\nholding    there    can   be   no   VICAR   liability   for   purely   personal\n\nmatters.     United States v. Bruno, 383 F.3d 65, 85 (2nd Cir. 2004);\n\nUnited States v. Thai, 29 F.3d 785, 818 (2nd Cir. 1994).               But those\n\ncases are inapposite, involving vastly different facts.\n\n             This question of motive under VICAR was for the jury to\n\nresolve.     The jury had sufficient evidence to support a conclusion\n\nthat a general motive was that Brandao did what he did, in large\n\npart or even solely, to improve his standing or because it was\n\nexpected of him in Stonehurst or both.           By the time of the Depina\n\nshooting in May of 1999, Brandao had, a jury could find, been a\n\nmember of Stonehurst for just two months and, anxious to earn his\n\nspurs, he had been helping with shootings.              Soon after Lopes, the\n\ngang leader, told Brandao about problems with Gomes and Dias,\n\n\n                                       -26-\n\fBrandao was out with other gang members shooting at Depina, using\n\na gun and a car previously used in gang shootings.                         A jury could\n\neasily      conclude       that   Brandao    did    so     to    impress   and   further\n\ningratiate himself with the gang leader.\n\nB.            Constructive Amendment\n\n              Brandao argues that the indictment was constructively\n\namended.       The error here was that the jury instruction as to\n\nracketeering Act Twenty charged the substantive crime of murder\n\n(the murder of Dinho Fernandes), even though the grand jury's\n\nindictment had only charged conspiracy to murder.4                           Conspiracy\n\nrequires the element of agreement, which murder does not. The jury\n\nverdict      form    also    described      the    count    as    murder   rather       than\n\nconspiracy to murder.             The jury found this racketeering act was\n\nproven beyond a reasonable doubt as to Brandao.\n\n              The     district       court        distributed       its    draft        jury\n\ninstructions to counsel more than a week before the jury was\n\ncharged      and    held    two   conferences       on   the     instructions      in    the\n\ninterim, yet Brandao did not object to the instruction or verdict\n\nform as to racketeering Act Twenty.                  Brandao, 448 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n317.       Brandao first raised the constructive amendment issue in a\n\n\n\n\n       4\n          This problem was created by the poor drafting of the\nindictment. Racketeering Act Twenty was titled \"Murder of Dinho\nFernandes,\" even though it charged that Brandao and others\n\"willfully and knowingly did conspire to murder\" Fernandes. See\nBrandao, 448 F. Supp. 2d at 316-17.\n\n                                            -27-\n\fpost-trial motion, which the district court denied.5                     Id. at 317,\n\n326.\n\n            As    an     unpreserved      objection,      Brandao's     constructive\n\namendment claim is subject to plain error review.                 Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n52(b); United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 722, 731 (1993); see also\n\nUnited States v. Johnson, 520 U.S. 462, 466 (1997) (Rule 52(b)'s\n\nplain error review applies to all direct appeals from federal\n\nconvictions, even as to structural errors).                   That test has four\n\nprongs: there must be (1) an error (2) that is plain and (3) that\n\nhas affected the defendant's substantial rights; and if the first\n\nthree prongs are satisfied, then a court may exercise discretion to\n\ncorrect a forfeited error if (4) the error \"seriously affect[s] the\n\nfairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"\n\nOlano, 507 U.S. at 732 (alteration in original) (quoting United\n\nStates v. Young, 470 U.S. 1, 15 (1985)) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n            We do not explore the question of whether this was in\n\nfact a constructive amendment.             In this case, the parties and the\n\ndistrict     court       have   agreed     that    the    jury    instruction        for\n\nracketeering       Act     Twenty   was    a     constructive     amendment.         \"A\n\nconstructive      amendment      occurs    when     the   charging      terms   of   an\n\nindictment       are     altered,   either       literally   or    in    effect,     by\n\n\n       5\n            We do not get into the debate between the parties about\nwhether the district court erred in itself utilizing plain error\nreview.\n\n                                          -28-\n\fprosecution or court after the grand jury has last passed upon\n\nthem.\"      United States v. Pierre, 484 F.3d 75, 81 (1st Cir. 2007)\n\n(quoting United States v. Fisher, 3 F.3d 456, 462 (1st Cir. 1993))\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).               In Stirone v. United States,\n\n361 U.S. 212 (1960), the Supreme Court emphasized the rule that \"a\n\ncourt cannot permit a defendant to be tried on charges that are not\n\nmade in the indictment against him.\"               Id. at 217.      The prohibition\n\non constructive amendment exists to preserve the defendant's Fifth\n\nAmendment     right   to     indictment      by   grand     jury,   to   prevent   re-\n\nprosecution     for    the    same    offense     in   violation     of   the   Sixth\n\nAmendment, and to protect the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to\n\nbe informed of the charges against him.                   Pierre, 484 F.3d at 81\n\n(citing United States v. Vavlitis, 9 F.3d 206, 210 (1st Cir.\n\n1993)).     The parties and the district court agreed the first two\n\nprongs of plain error review were met: there was error and it was\n\nplain.\n\n             This brings us to the third prong of the Olano plain\n\nerror analysis and the heart of the issue in this case.                   Rule 52(b)\n\nrequires the plain error to \"affect substantial rights,\" which \"in\n\nmost cases . . . means that the error must have been prejudicial:\n\nIt   must     have    affected       the    outcome    of    the    district    court\n\nproceedings.\"        Olano, 507 U.S. at 734.           It is the defendant who\n\nbears the burden of demonstrating a reasonable probability that,\n\nbut for the error, the result of the proceeding would have been\n\n\n                                           -29-\n\fdifferent.   United States v. Dominguez Benitez, 542 U.S. 74, 81-82\n\n(2004); United States v. Borrero-Acevedo, No. 06-2655, ___ F.3d\n\n___, 2008 WL 2687355, at *3 (1st Cir. July 10, 2008); United States\n\nv. Padilla, 415 F.3d 211, 220-21 (1st Cir. 2005) (en banc).\n\n          The Supreme Court in Olano reserved the question of\n\nwhether there might be some errors for which specific prejudice\n\nneed not be shown.   Olano, 507 U.S. at 735.   In this context, the\n\nCourt referred to structural errors -- constitutional errors that\n\ndeprive the defendant of a fundamentally fair trial and thus may\n\nnot be found harmless under Rule 52(a)'s harmless error standard --\n\nand \"those errors that should be presumed prejudicial if the\n\ndefendant cannot make a specific showing of prejudice.\"6   Id.   If\n\nthis category of errors not requiring a showing of prejudice does\n\nexist, the Court's conclusion that \"[n]ormally, although perhaps\n\nnot in every case, the defendant must make a specific showing of\n\nprejudice,\" id., suggests that it is very limited.\n\n          Brandao argues that constructive amendment falls into\n\nthis limited category, whether it is labeled structural error or\n\nper se prejudicial, and thus that the third prong of the plain\n\n\n\n     6\n          Some have distinguished between these two concepts\n(structural error and presumed prejudice).       See, e.g., United\nStates v. Syme, 276 F.3d 131, 153 (3d Cir. 2002); United States v.\nFloresca, 38 F.3d 706, 713 n.16 (4th Cir. 1994) (en banc)\n(describing \"presumed prejudice\" as a separate category of errors\nand suggesting that the Court was referring to errors necessitating\na rebuttable presumption). Whether or not there is a distinction,\nit does not affect our analysis or conclusion.\n\n                               -30-\n\ferror test is automatically satisfied in this case.                                 He points to\n\ndicta in this circuit's case law and to the broad language of the\n\nSupreme Court's decision in Stirone in support of his position. We\n\nhave never confronted this question directly, and our sister\n\ncircuits have reached disparate conclusions.\n\n               The    Fourth       Circuit        has    held        that   the     constructive\n\namendment of an indictment is a structural error. United States v.\n\nFloresca, 38 F.3d 706, 713 (4th Cir. 1994) (en banc).                                 The Second\n\nCircuit has held that it is per se prejudicial.                              United States v.\n\nThomas, 274 F.3d 655, 670 (2d Cir. 2001) (en banc); see also United\n\nStates v. Ford, 435 F.3d 204, 216 (2d Cir. 2006).                                 Both circuits\n\nthus presume that a constructive amendment will always satisfy the\n\nthird prong of Olano.\n\n               The Fifth, Seventh, Ninth, and District of Columbia\n\nCircuits       adhere       to     the    usual     plain        error      formulation     when\n\nconsidering constructive amendments, requiring the defendant to\n\nbear the burden of showing specific prejudice.                               United States v.\n\nHugs,    384     F.3d       762,    768     (9th        Cir.    2004)       (finding     that   a\n\nconstructive         amendment           error     did         not     violate       defendant's\n\nsubstantial rights under prong three without discussion of per se\n\nprejudice or structural error); United States v. Fletcher, 121 F.3d\n\n187,    192-93       (5th    Cir.        1997),    abrogated          on    other    grounds    as\n\nrecognized by United States v. Robinson, 367 F.3d 278, 286 n.11\n\n(5th Cir. 2004); United States v. Remsza, 77 F.3d 1039, 1044 (7th\n\n\n                                              -31-\n\fCir. 1996); United States v. Lawton, 995 F.2d 290, 294 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1993) (finding that a constructive amendment error was prejudicial\n\nunder    prong   three   without     discussion   of   per   se   prejudice   or\n\nstructural error).       Both the Fifth and the Ninth Circuits have\n\nrecognized that their pre-Olano jurisprudence required automatic\n\nreversal for constructive amendments even on plain error review,\n\nbut that more recent Supreme Court case law had raised serious\n\ndoubts that such a per se approach was still appropriate.               United\n\nStates v. Dipentino, 242 F.3d 1090, 1095 (9th Cir. 2001); Fletcher,\n\n121 F.3d at 192-93; see also United States v. Daniels, 252 F.3d\n\n411, 414 n.8 (5th Cir. 2001) (describing Fletcher as replacing\n\nautomatic    reversal    rule   in    constructive     amendment   cases   with\n\nstandard plain error review in order to align with Olano).7\n\n            Finally, the Third Circuit alone has departed from the\n\nusual plain error protocol and fashioned a rebuttable presumption\n\nof prejudice for unpreserved claims of constructive amendment on\n\nplain error review.      United States v. Syme, 276 F.3d 131, 154 (3d\n\nCir. 2002) (en banc); see also United States v. McKee, 506 F.3d\n\n\n\n     7\n          The Tenth Circuit has avoided the question altogether by\ninstead finding Olano's fourth prong unsatisfied, similar to the\nSupreme Court's approach in Johnson and United States v. Cotton,\n535 U.S. 625 (2002). See United States v. Brown, 400 F.3d 1242,\n1253-54 (10th Cir. 2005); United States v. Gonzalez Edeza, 359 F.3d\n1246, 1250-52 (10th Cir. 2004).     In Brown, however, the Tenth\nCircuit noted that following Cotton, any tension in its case law\nbetween automatic reversal and plain error review of unpreserved\nclaims of constructive amendment must be resolved against automatic\nreversal. Brown, 400 F.3d at 1253 n.6.\n\n                                      -32-\n\f225, 229 (3d Cir. 2007).   On the assumption that it will normally\n\nbe difficult for a defendant to prove a constructive amendment\n\nresulted in prejudice, that circuit presumes a defendant has met\n\nthe prejudice requirement of the third prong unless the government\n\nmeets its burden of rebuttal.8    Syme, 276 F.3d at 154.\n\n          This circuit's cases have often described constructive\n\namendments as \"prejudicial per se,\" but always in dicta. This \"per\n\nse\" language seems to have begun with dicta in United States v.\n\nDunn, 758 F.2d 30, 35 (1st Cir. 1985), and has carried through in\n\nmany a circuit case since, most recently in United States v. Bucci,\n\n525 F.3d 116, 131 (1st Cir. 2008).      In almost every one of these\n\ncases, the court found no constructive amendment and thus no error,\n\nwhether or not the objection had been preserved in the district\n\ncourt.9\n\n\n\n     8\n          The court in Syme noted, however, that even though it\nbelieves that constructive amendments are presumed prejudicial, it\ndoubts that constructive amendments would be structural error,\ngiven recent Supreme Court decisions. 276 F.3d at 155 n.10.\n     9\n          Bucci, 525 F.3d at 131; United States v. Hernández, 490\nF.3d 81, 83-84 (1st Cir. 2007); United States v. Malpica-García,\n489 F.3d 393, 398 (1st Cir. 2007); Pierre, 484 F.3d at 81-82;\nUnited States v. Mueffelman, 470 F.3d 33, 38 (1st Cir. 2006);\nUnited States v. DeCicco, 439 F.3d 36, 43, 46-47 (1st Cir. 2006);\nUnited States v. Gómez-Rosario, 418 F.3d 90, 104-05 (1st Cir.\n2005); United States v. Fornia-Castillo, 408 F.3d 52, 65-66 (1st\nCir. 2005); United States v. Cianci, 378 F.3d 71, 93-94 (1st Cir.\n2004); United States v. Dubón-Otero, 292 F.3d 1, 4 & n.2 (1st Cir.\n2002); United States v. Portela, 167 F.3d 687, 701-02 (1st Cir.\n1999); United States v. Paredes-Rodriguez, 160 F.3d 49, 55 (1st\nCir. 1998); Vavlitis, 9 F.3d at 210; United States v. Fisher, 3\nF.3d 456, 462-63 (1st Cir. 1993); Dunn, 758 F.2d at 35, 38.\n\n                                 -33-\n\f            Only two of our cases require further discussion.                In\n\nUnited    States   v.   Iacaboni,   363    F.3d   1   (1st   Cir.   2004),   the\n\ndefendant pled guilty to one type of money laundering, but the\n\ndistrict court ordered forfeiture under a different theory of money\n\nlaundering.    Id. at 7.     We reversed the relevant portion of the\n\nforfeiture order because we concluded a constructive amendment had\n\noccurred and that such an \"alteration is . . . per se prejudicial.\"\n\nId.      That case is distinguishable.            First, we held that the\n\ndefendant had preserved his claim below, so the question of plain\n\nerror review was not implicated.          Id.   Second, Iacaboni considered\n\nan error in sentencing, not an error in conviction, and the\n\ndistinction could be meaningful; in Iacaboni, for instance, the\n\nconstructive amendment led directly to a forfeiture order amounting\n\nto $7,495, clearly a prejudicial outcome.\n\n            As for United States v. Santa-Manzano, 842 F.2d 1 (1st\n\nCir. 1988), the court spoke there in terms of variance, not\n\nconstructive amendment; it predated Olano; it did not use the\n\nlanguage of prejudice per se; and it described the variance in\n\nterms of prejudice, namely that the defendant did not have adequate\n\n\n\n\n                                    -34-\n\fnotice of the charges against him.10   Id. at 2-3.   These cases do\n\nnot address or resolve the question before us today.\n\n          Thus we are confronted squarely with this question for\n\nthe first time.    We agree with those circuits that apply the\n\nstandard prejudice evaluation to constructive amendment claims on\n\nplain error review and do not presume prejudice.       We do so for\n\nseveral reasons.\n\n          First, the Supreme Court's jurisprudence is increasingly\n\nwary of recognizing new structural errors or otherwise establishing\n\nper se outcomes under plain error review.   When listing structural\n\nerrors in recent cases, the Court has not included constructive\n\namendments.   See Washington v. Recuenco, ___ U.S. ___, 126 S. Ct.\n\n2546, 2551 n.2 (2006); Neder v. United States, 527 U.S. 1, 8\n\n(1999); Johnson, 520 U.S. at 468-69.   The Court has also expressed\n\nunwillingness to expand that list of structural errors any further,\n\nrecognizing that \"most constitutional errors can be harmless.\"\n\nNeder, 527 U.S. at 8 (quoting Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U.S. 277,\n\n306 (1991)) (internal quotation marks omitted).   Indeed, the Court\n\nhas said \"if the defendant had counsel and was tried by an\n\n\n\n     10\n          Our opinion in United States v. Mojica-Baez, 229 F.3d 292\n(1st Cir. 2000), dealt with failure to submit an element of an\noffense to the jury, which meant that the defendant was sentenced\nfor a more serious offense than that for which he was indicted and\nfound guilty.   Id. at 306.   On plain error review, we rejected\ndefendant's argument that the error should be considered a\nstructural error and required a showing of prejudice under prong\nthree. Id. at 307, 309-10.\n\n                               -35-\n\fimpartial adjudicator, there is a strong presumption that any other\n\n[constitutional] errors that may have occurred are subject to\n\nharmless-error analysis\" and are thus not structural errors.             Id.\n\n(quoting   Rose   v.   Clark,   478   U.S.   570,   579   (1986))   (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). In recent years, the Court has routinely\n\nrejected arguments that additional specific categories of errors\n\nshould be considered structural errors.              See, e.g., id. at 8\n\n(omission of element of offense in jury instructions); Fulminante,\n\n499 U.S. at 310-11 (collecting cases).         This unwillingness is even\n\nmore pronounced in the plain error context, with the Court bluntly\n\nstating that \"[a] per se approach to plain-error review is flawed.\"\n\nYoung, 470 U.S. at 16 n.14.           In keeping with this trend, this\n\ncourt, sitting en banc in Padilla, refused to expand the category\n\nof structural errors beyond those already recognized by the Supreme\n\nCourt, noting the category has been reserved for a very limited\n\nclass of cases involving \"only the most pervasive and debilitating\n\nerrors.\"   415 F.3d at 219.\n\n           Second, there are good reasons not to extend the list of\n\nstructural errors to include constructive amendments. Constructive\n\namendments come in many varieties: some constructive amendments\n\nbroaden indictments; some effectively narrow indictments.             In many\n\ncases, constructive amendments will not be the sort of error that\n\nwill \"deprive defendants of 'basic protections' without which a\n\n'criminal trial cannot reliably serve its function as a vehicle for\n\n\n                                      -36-\n\fdetermining guilt or innocence . . . and no criminal punishment may\n\nbe regarded as fundamentally fair.'\"                  Neder, 527 U.S. at 8-9\n\n(quoting    Rose,    478   U.S.    at    577-78).      We   believe   this    case\n\ndemonstrates that point. Because the term \"constructive amendment\"\n\nincludes a number of different types of errors, some of which will\n\nnot always be prejudicial, the term \"constructive amendment\" does\n\nnot create a good candidate for departing from usual plain error\n\nreview. Cf. id. at 14 (describing approach to structural errors as\n\ntraditionally       categorical:    \"a    constitutional     error    is    either\n\nstructural or it is not\").          Labels like \"constructive amendment\"\n\nshould rarely dictate outcomes.                We also agree with the Fifth\n\nCircuit that abandoning the usual plain error rule will create\n\nperverse incentives which may harm the administration of the\n\ncriminal justice system.          See Fletcher, 121 F.3d at 193; see also\n\nFloresca, 38 F.3d at 727 (Russell, J., dissenting).\n\n            Third, Stirone does not, as defendant argues, compel a\n\ncontrary conclusion. In Stirone, a union official was charged with\n\nviolating the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1951, by interfering with\n\ninterstate commerce through extortion.                361 U.S. at 213.        The\n\nindictment charged Stirone with obstructing shipments of sand to\n\nPennsylvania to make concrete to build steel mills, but the judge\n\nallowed    the   government   to     argue     that   Stirone's   actions     also\n\naffected interstate commerce by interfering with the steel mill's\n\nability to ship steel from Pennsylvania.              Id. at 213-14.       Because\n\n\n                                        -37-\n\fthe jury was allowed to convict on either theory of interference\n\nwith interstate commerce, and because the indictment had made no\n\nmention of the second theory, it was possible that Stirone had been\n\nconvicted on a charge not made (and not intended) by the grand\n\njury.     Id. at 214, 218-19.             The Supreme Court reversed the\n\nconviction,      holding    that    the   trial    court    had   impermissibly\n\nbroadened the indictment in violation of defendant's constitutional\n\nrights.    Id. at 219.\n\n            Significantly, Stirone did not involve the issue which\n\nconfronts us here: in Stirone, the objection to the constructive\n\namendment was preserved; the case did not involve plain error\n\nreview at all.11         361 U.S. at 214.         Under modern Supreme Court\n\njurisprudence, the difference between harmless error and plain\n\nerror review is a meaningful one.          See, e.g., Johnson, 520 U.S. at\n\n469-70 (even structural errors are subject to plain error review's\n\nfourth prong).\n\n            We    also     note    that   the     Supreme   Court   has   never\n\nspecifically resolved \"the more sophisticated question of whether\n\na structural error necessarily affects substantial rights, thereby\n\nautomatically satisfying the third element of the plain error\n\ntest.\"    Padilla, 415 F.3d at 220 n.1.           Some courts have concluded\n\nthat errors that cannot be harmless must also be per se prejudicial\n\n\n     11\n          The government argues Stirone may have involved, in\ntoday's terminology, a variance and not a constructive amendment.\nWe do not address the issue.\n\n                                      -38-\n\funder Olano's third prong.     See id. (collecting cases).             But that\n\nis not a necessary outcome.         See, e.g., Syme, 276 F.3d at 152\n\n(noting that per se reversal rule for preserved errors might not\n\nextend to plain error review); Remsza, 77 F.3d at 1044 (noting that\n\ncircuit's rule requiring prejudice analysis for all errors on plain\n\nerror   review);   Floresca,   38     F.3d    at    722-23       (Russell,    J.,\n\ndissenting) (disagreeing with majority's presumption that errors\n\nnot subject to harmless error review will also not necessitate a\n\nshowing of prejudice under plain error review).                   Thus even if\n\nStirone does require automatic reversal of constructive amendments\n\nfor preserved claims of error on harmless error review, that would\n\nnot necessarily mean that prejudice should be presumed on plain\n\nerror review.\n\n          Further, the Court has not extended Stirone's per se\n\nreversal approach to closely related situations.                 See Neder, 527\n\nU.S. at 8 (omission of element of offense in jury charge not a\n\nstructural   error);   Johnson,   520      U.S.    at   469-70    (refusing    to\n\nexercise discretion under Olano's fourth prong where trial court\n\nfailed to submit element of offense to jury); United States v.\n\nMiller, 471 U.S. 130, 145 (1985) (finding no violation of grand\n\njury right where charges in indictment were broader than proof\n\npresented at trial).     The facts of this case make it likewise\n\ndistinguishable from Stirone, as discussed below.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -39-\n\f            We also decline to alter the usual plain error standard\n\nto provide defendant with a presumption of prejudice that would\n\nshift the burden to the government to show lack of prejudice.            We\n\nsee no basis in Supreme Court holdings to do so.12              We will not\n\nconclude that in all cases it will be \"well-nigh impossible to\n\ndetermine    the   amount   of   harm\"   resulting   from   a   constructive\n\namendment.    United States v. Mojica-Baez, 229 F.3d 292, 309 (1st\n\nCir. 2000).    We believe that, depending on the facts of a given\n\ncase, some constructive amendments will, by their nature and from\n\nthe risks they create for defendant, be so great that a reviewing\n\ncourt may find the requisite prejudice under Olano's third prong.\n\n            We hold that the defendant must make the required showing\n\nof prejudice under Olano and its progeny.            Defendant here cannot\n\nmeet his burden.     Defendant views the error as involving primarily\n\nhis Fifth Amendment rights to a grand jury indictment; the district\n\ncourt viewed the error as involving primarily defendant's Sixth\n\nAmendment rights.     However considered, this constructive amendment\n\ndid not seriously jeopardize defendant's rights and did not present\n\na reasonable probability of affecting the outcome of the district\n\ncourt proceedings.\n\n            As the district court astutely pointed out, here, \"unlike\n\nStirone, Defendant was not charged with an act not alleged at all\n\n\n     12\n          We acknowledge the Third and the Fourth Circuits'\nargument that there is such a basis based on dicta in Olano. See\nSyme, 276 F.3d at 153; Floresca, 28 F.3d at 713 n.16.\n\n                                    -40-\n\fin the indictment.\"       Brandao, 448 F. Supp. 2d at 319.            Although\n\nracketeering Act Twenty under Count Two of the indictment charged\n\nconspiracy to murder, and not murder, the grand jury alleged in\n\nCount Thirty-Three that Brandao murdered Fernandes when it charged\n\nthat Brandao committed the murder to maintain or increase his\n\nposition in the Stonehurst enterprise. We do not have to speculate\n\nwhether the grand jury would have indicted Brandao for the actual\n\nmurder of Fernandes; in practical terms it did.               Cf. Stirone, 361\n\nU.S. at 217 (noting that no court \"can know that the grand jury\n\nwould   have   been   willing    to   charge\"     defendant   on   grounds    not\n\nmentioned in indictment but presented to petit jury); Thomas, 274\n\nF.3d at 670 (warning against speculating what a grand jury might\n\nhave charged in its indictment).        We thus have no concerns that the\n\ngrand jury would have returned a conforming indictment charging\n\nmurder.   For the same reason, Brandao was provided adequate notice\n\nof the charges against him.       Cf. Miller, 471 U.S. at 134-35 (noting\n\nlack of notice concerns in finding no error where variance narrowed\n\nindictment); Hugs, 384 F.3d at 768 (finding no prejudice where\n\nindictment     provided   fair    notice     of   evidence     that   would   be\n\nintroduced at trial).\n\n           The district court also cogently explained why the error\n\ncould not have affected the trial's outcome: given the evidence at\n\ntrial, the jury could not have found Brandao guilty of murder (the\n\namended charge) if it had not also found he had colluded with\n\n\n                                      -41-\n\fothers to carry out the murder.               \"Because the government never\n\nsuggested that Defendant pulled the trigger, an agreement was a\n\nnecessary condition of the jury's finding Defendant guilty of the\n\nsubstantive murder via an aiding and abetting theory.\"                   Brandao,\n\n448 F. Supp. 2d at 323-24.13\n\n             Indeed, as the district court and the government have\n\nnoted,     this    case   resembles    those     cases   in   which   the    court\n\nerroneously omits an element of an offense when instructing the\n\njury (here the element of agreement).             See id. at 324.     Given the\n\nevidence at trial and the jury's actual verdict, the record could\n\nnot \"rationally lead to a contrary finding with respect to the\n\nomitted element,\" the prejudice analysis applied in Neder.                        527\n\nU.S. at 19.\n\n             This case does not raise concerns of adequate notice, of\n\nwhether the grand jury would have indicted on the amended charge,\n\nor   of    material   unfairness      to   the   defendant.      There      was   no\n\nprejudice.        We add, but do not rely on, our view that Brandao's\n\nclaim would fail in any event under the fourth prong of the plain\n\nerror test.\n\n\n      13\n          The fact that the jury acquitted Brandao on Count Thirty-\nThree does not call this reasoning into doubt. As the district\ncourt explained, the jury could have found Brandao guilty of\nmurdering Fernandes while not also finding that, as required for a\nVICAR conviction, he committed the murder to maintain or improve\nhis position in Stonehurst.     Brandao, 448 F. Supp. 2d at 320.\nRather, the evidence presented at trial could have allowed the jury\nto find that Brandao's participation in the Fernandes murder\nprovided Brandao's entry into the Stonehurst enterprise. Id.\n\n                                       -42-\n\fC.          Prosecutor's Closing Arguments\n\n            Brandao argues that the prosecutor made improper comments\n\nin closing, and those remarks so offended defendant's due process\n\nrights as to deny him a fair trial.         The usual test is whether the\n\nprosecutor's misconduct \"'so poisoned the well' that the trial's\n\noutcome was likely affected.\"          United States v. Azubike, 504 F.3d\n\n30, 39 (1st Cir. 2007) (quoting United States v. Joyner, 191 F.3d\n\n47, 54 (1st Cir. 1999)) (internal quotation marks omitted).             But\n\nhere there was no objection, so review is for plain error.\n\n            The claim is that there were two types of impropriety in\n\nthe closing: that certain arguments had no basis in the evidence\n\nand that one remark impermissibly broadened the indictment.              We\n\ndisagree.     See United States v. Duval, 496 F.3d 64, 78 (1st Cir.\n\n2007).\n\n            Brandao objects to the prosecution's statements that his\n\nactions   before   and   after   the    Fernandes   shooting   demonstrated\n\nBrandao was \"enlisting [Stonehurst's] services.\" The statement was\n\nrelevant to the element of the nexus between the shooting and the\n\nenterprise.    The prosecution did nothing wrong in asking the jury\n\nto draw this permissible inference from the evidence.                United\n\nStates v. Hernández, 218 F.3d 58, 68-69 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n            The second claim is that the prosecution broadened the\n\nindictment when, during rebuttal, at closing, the prosecutor said,\n\n\"any problem of a member was the gang's problem.\"         The argument was\n\n\n                                   -43-\n\fmade in response to a key theme in the defense's closing: that each\n\nof the charged shootings was personal and therefore unconnected\n\nwith the RICO enterprise. It was fair for the prosecution to argue\n\nthat merely because there was some personal benefit from a shooting\n\ndid not mean the shooting was unconnected from the enterprise.\n\nWhile it is not literally true in the abstract that any problem of\n\na member was the gang's problem, in context, there is no reason to\n\nbelieve the jury took the government to be arguing that.\n\n            The prosecutor did overstate in its closing, in one\n\nsentence    made    in   anticipation   of   a   defense   argument.   The\n\nprosecutor said the \"shootings . . . were related to the affairs of\n\nthe enterprise and were to protect people in order to carry on\n\ntheir business, in order to recruit.\" (Emphasis added.) While the\n\nstatement may be true in other cases, the government, on appeal,\n\nadmits there was no evidence that Stonehurst tried to recruit\n\nBrandao.    But attorneys for both sides misspeak during closings,\n\nand there is no reason to think this lone comment had any effect on\n\nthe jury.    The transcript of the prosecutor's closing is thirty-\n\nseven pages.       United States v. Allen, 469 F.3d 11, 16 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).   The statement did not even evoke an objection from defense\n\ncounsel, and the court instructed that the closing arguments were\n\nnot evidence.\n\n            We reject the claim of error.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -44-\n\fD.        Denial of Motion for a New Trial: Claim the Government\n          Suppressed Impeachment Material\n\n          The district court rejected Brandao's motion for a new\n\ntrial based on his claim that the government suppressed potential\n\nimpeachment evidence in violation of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S.\n\n83, 87 (1963).     \"Impeachment evidence must be material before its\n\nsuppression justifies a new trial.\"     Conley v. United States, 415\n\nF.3d 183, 188 (1st Cir. 2005).       Review of the district court's\n\ndecision to deny a defendant's motion for a new trial on the basis\n\nof alleged Brady violations is for manifest abuse of discretion.\n\nUnited States v. Morales-Rodríguez, 467 F.3d 1, 14 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n          The court found there was no bad faith involved in the\n\nprosecution's failure to learn and to disclose that Lopes, its key\n\nwitness, had a new state criminal conviction, after it had told the\n\ndefense about the underlying state charges.       Such a conviction\n\nviolated his federal plea agreement and yet he was not punished.\n\nThis would have given defense counsel an argument to counter the\n\ngovernment's assertion that Lopes's plea agreement gave him every\n\nincentive to tell the truth for fear of punishment.\n\n          The court found that while there was some impeachment\n\nvalue to the evidence, the evidence was cumulative of a great deal\n\nof other evidence that Lopes had incentive to lie.   Brandao, 448 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 328.    But the court also noted that Lopes's basic story\n\nabout the events in this case had not changed over the four years\n\nbefore trial.      Id.    And Lopes's testimony was reinforced by\n\n                                 -45-\n\fBrandao's own statements to the police, by ballistics evidence, and\n\nby the discovery of a firearm in the car Brandao drove for the\n\nDepina shooting.     Id.\n\n           There was no abuse of discretion in finding this omission\n\nwas not material.\n\nE.         Sentencing\n\n           The district court sentenced Brandao to a total sentence\n\nof   333   months'      imprisonment,      rejecting     the    government's\n\nrecommendations    that    would   have    effectively    amounted    to   life\n\nimprisonment.    To Brandao's benefit, the court imposed concurrent\n\ntwenty-year sentences on the two RICO counts (reduced for time\n\nserved) and added the mandatory consecutive ten-year sentence on\n\nthe VICAR count.     The court then adjusted the twenty-year sentence\n\ndownward by subtracting twenty-seven months to account for the time\n\nBrandao spent in state custody on the Depina shooting.               The court\n\nordered a five-year period of supervised release and ordered\n\nrestitution of $6,955 to Dinho Fernandes's family to pay for the\n\nfuneral service.\n\n           Brandao argues that the sentence was unreasonable because\n\nit was disproportionate to his activities and criminal history and\n\nbecause it created an unwarranted disparity with other defendants,\n\nmore culpable, he says, than he.\n\n           The   district   judge   presided    over     and   sentenced    the\n\ndefendants in both this and the Nascimento case.                   The court\n\n\n                                    -46-\n\fthoughtfully explained its rationale for the sentence.                     The fact\n\nthat the court did not explicitly mention the 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)\n\nsentencing    factors    means    nothing      in   this   case,    as    the   court\n\nobviously considered them. See United States v. Alli, 444 F.3d 34,\n\n41 (1st Cir. 2006) (affirming sentence where district court did not\n\nexplicitly address any of the § 3553(a) factors individually).\n\n             The court addressed both Brandao's particular activities\n\nin the commission of the crime and his criminal history.                  The court\n\ntook into account that Brandao did not shoot Fernandes and that\n\nMonteiro did.      The judge considered the defendant's lack of a\n\ncriminal record and could find no reason in his background to\n\nexplain Brandao's crimes. The court also considered Brandao's luck\n\nthat Lopes was a \"lousy shot\" and did not manage to kill Depina.\n\nThe court also recognized that Stonehurst gunned down people for\n\ntrivial gripes, leading to longstanding and senseless violence in\n\nthe community.\n\n             As to the supposed disparity with the other Stonehurst\n\ndefendants,     the     court    also     considered       and     explained     the\n\ndispositions for the other players: those were largely driven by\n\nthe prosecution's charging decisions, the strength of the evidence\n\nagainst the various defendants, and the fact that Monteiro pled\n\nguilty while Brandao chose to go to trial.             The court's conclusion\n\nthat   the    players    were    not    similarly     situated      was    entirely\n\nreasonable.     See United States v. Cirilo-Muñoz, 504 F.3d 106, 134\n\n\n                                        -47-\n\f(1st Cir. 2007) (co-defendant who pled guilty is not similarly\n\nsituated to co-defendant who was found guilty by a jury).\n\n          Even before the Supreme Court's decisions in Gall v.\n\nUnited States, ___ U.S. ___, 128 S. Ct. 586 (2007), and Kimbrough\n\nv. United States, ___ U.S. ___, 128 S. Ct. 558 (2007), we would\n\nhave found no fault in this sentence and we find none today.\n\n                              III.\n\n          The convictions and sentence are affirmed.\n\n\n\n                  -Concurring Opinion Follows-\n\n\n\n\n                              -48-\n\f            LIPEZ, Circuit Judge, concurring.                   I concur with the\n\nmajority's sufficiency of the evidence analysis and its conclusion\n\nthat   we    should    apply       the    standard      prejudice    framework    to\n\nconstructive amendment claims on plain error review and not presume\n\nprejudice.     However, I adopt that conclusion only because of my\n\nagreement    with     the    majority     that   many    so-called    constructive\n\namendment claims lend themselves readily to ordinary plain error\n\nanalysis.    This case illustrates that point well.\n\n            For me, this rationale alone justifies our conclusion\n\nthat the standard prejudice framework should apply to unpreserved\n\nconstructive amendment claims.               I specifically do not join the\n\nmajority's analysis of the Supreme Court's jurisprudence related to\n\nstructural    errors        and   the    compatibility     of   a   presumption   of\n\nprejudice with the Supreme Court's plain error jurisprudence.                     In\n\nmy view, that analysis is not essential to our conclusion on the\n\nconsequences of a constructive amendment that was not the subject\n\nof a timely objection.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -49-\n\f",

A decade ago there were a series of\n\nshootings and murders involving two warring Cape Verdean youth\n\ngangs, Stonehurst and Wendover, in Boston and in Brockton, a\n\nneighboring community.        Federal prosecutions ensued under the\n\nRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations statute (\"RICO\"), 18\n\nU.S.C. §§ 1961-68, and the Violent Crimes in Aid of Racketeering\n\nstatute   (\"VICAR\"),   18   U.S.C.    §    1959.

This\n\ncase, against Angelo Brandao, was one of those prosecutions.                The\n\nindictment charged Brandao, who was eighteen at the time, with\n\nconspiracy to commit the 1999 murder of a high school student,\n\nDinho Fernandes, and the shootings of Alcides Depina and Antonio\n\nDias.\n\n            Angelo Brandao appeals his conviction on four RICO counts\n\nand one VICAR count.   The appeal requires us to consider two issues\n\nof particular note.    One concerns the content of the \"associated\n\nwith,\"    \"relatedness,\"    and   \"pattern    of   racketeering    activity\"\n\nelements of RICO.      Brandao challenges the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence that the government presented at trial on each of these\n\nelements.    The second concerns a constructive amendment of the\n\nindictment via the jury instructions and the standard of prejudice\n\nthat will be applied to his unpreserved claim of error.

We\n\nalso account for defense theories in analyzing the permissible\n\ninferences from the evidence.\n\nA.          Stonehurst-Wendover Feud\n\n            In the early 1990s, Augusto \"Gus\" Lopes, his younger\n\nbrother Nardo Lopes, and Bobby Mendes belonged to a group whose\n\nactivities    centered   around   Wendover    Street   in   the   Roxbury\n\nneighborhood of Boston.    In 1995, Nardo Lopes was charged with the\n\nmurder of Mendes and fled Boston.       Gus Lopes, who was in prison at\n\nthe time of the killing, vowed to eliminate any potential witnesses\n\nto his brother's crime and to exact revenge on members of the\n\nWendover group who remained sympathetic to Mendes and who harassed\n\nLopes's relatives.\n\n            After his release from prison, Gus Lopes became close to\n\nAmando \"Manny\" Monteiro.    Monteiro is the cousin of the defendant\n\nhere.      In 1997, Monteiro introduced Lopes to others who had\n\npreexisting antagonisms with the Wendover group. Lopes joined this\n\nStonehurst group, named after Stonehurst Street in the Dorchester\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fneighborhood.     Lopes and Monteiro became leaders of the Stonehurst\n\ngroup and led Stonehurst members on numerous \"missions\" to hunt\n\ndown and shoot members of Wendover.          Wendover members did the same\n\nas to Stonehurst. The Stonehurst-Wendover shootings reached their\n\napex in the period from June 1998 to July 2000.\n\nB.         Dinho Fernandes Murder\n\n           A relatively trivial dispute between classmates at a\n\nBrockton high school on the morning of March 17, 1999 started a\n\nsequence of events which led to the death of one of the students,\n\nDinho Fernandes.       The dispute continued after school ended and a\n\nscuffle followed, involving Fernandes and Adalberto Barros at\n\nBarros's home.      Defendant Brandao was there to support Barros.\n\nBoth defendant and Barros were cousins of Manny Monteiro.\n\n           Later that day, Lopes and Monteiro were at work at a gas\n\nstation in Brookline, Massachusetts when Monteiro received a page\n\non his beeper around 4:00pm.       After answering the page, Monteiro\n\nasked to borrow Lopes's car and told Lopes that a \"family member\"\n\nwas \"having problems\" in Brockton.           Lopes never knew who made the\n\ncall.   The defense theory was that the call came from Barros, not\n\nthe defendant.      Lopes offered to drive Monteiro to Brockton in\n\nLopes's rental car, a bright red Dodge Stratus. Lopes and Monteiro\n\nstopped   twice   en   route,   first   at    Monteiro's   house,   then   in\n\nRandolph, Massachusetts to pick up Louis Rodrigues, another member\n\nof Stonehurst.     Lopes explained to Rodrigues that they were going\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fto Brockton \"to check out Manny's cousin.\"    The trio then drove to\n\nBrandao's home in Brockton.   There was no evidence about the prior\n\nrelationship between Brandao and his cousin Manny Monteiro.\n\n          Shortly after the Stonehurst members arrived, a blue\n\nHonda occupied by Brandao and an unidentified male pulled up behind\n\nthe Dodge.   Although Brandao was Monteiro's cousin, this was the\n\nfirst time Monteiro's friend Lopes ever saw Brandao.      The Dodge\n\nfollowed the Honda to nearby Hunt Street, where Brandao pointed out\n\nthe window of the Honda toward three teenagers standing on the\n\ncorner who appeared to be of Cape Verdean descent.    In the Dodge,\n\nLopes directed Monteiro and Rodrigues to \"blaze them.\"       At the\n\ntime, none of the three Stonehurst members were armed so they\n\nneeded to get a weapon.\n\n          Both cars returned to Brandao's home, which Monteiro\n\nentered briefly before returning to the Dodge.        There was no\n\nevidence on whether Brandao entered the house as well.    The Dodge\n\nthen followed the Honda back toward Hunt Street.        Before they\n\narrived, Rodrigues motioned for the Honda to pull over, and both\n\ncars stopped by the side of the road.        Brandao got out of the\n\nHonda, and handed Monteiro, in the Dodge, a 9mm handgun.    Brandao\n\nreturned to the Honda, and the cars again drove toward Hunt Street.\n\n          When Lopes spotted the teenagers Brandao had identified,\n\nMonteiro fired at them from the back window of the Dodge, emptying\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\fhis clip.     Two of the teenagers were seriously wounded, and\n\nanother, Dinho Fernandes, died on the scene.\n\n            After    the   shooting,    Lopes,   Monteiro,   and   Rodrigues\n\nreturned to Brandao's house. Monteiro went into the house with the\n\nshooting weapon and came out unarmed. The weapon, a 9mm handgun,\n\nhad been used in earlier Stonehurst shootings before Brandao handed\n\nit to Monteiro.\n\nC.          Antonio Dias Shooting\n\n            Within   days   of   the   Fernandes   murder,   Brandao   began\n\ncommuting between Brockton and Boston to meet with Lopes and help\n\nhim hunt down Wendover members.         Among Lopes's targets were Jimmy\n\nGomes and Antonio Dias.      Lopes went on about half a dozen missions\n\nto Brockton to look for Gomes and Dias between 1998 and 2000.\n\nAlthough Gomes and Dias were not members of Wendover, they had\n\ntaken the side of a Wendover member in a dispute between him and\n\nJohn and Mario DeSoto.       The DeSotos were friends of Lopes as well\n\nas Brandao's cousins.\n\n            On April 27, 1999, Lopes, Brandao, and Stonehurst member\n\nValdir Fernandes spotted Dias in Brockton during one of their\n\nmissions.    Lopes and Brandao lay in wait for Dias outside of a\n\nhouse.    When Dias emerged, Lopes and Brandao fired repeatedly at\n\nDias.    The bullets damaged Dias's car, but Dias escaped unharmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fD.           Alcides Depina Shooting\n\n             On the night of May 14, 1999, Jimmy Gomes's brother\n\nAlcides Depina was walking towards Gomes's home in Brockton when he\n\nnoticed an Acura driving slowly towards him with its lights off.\n\nA man in a blue jogging suit emerged from the passenger side of the\n\ncar and ran towards Depina.    As Depina ran away, he saw a red beam\n\nshining over his shoulder and heard multiple gunshots.        Depina\n\nmanaged to reach Gomes's house safely, and the shooter ran back\n\ntowards the car.\n\n             Within minutes, the police responded to calls about the\n\nshooting and detained a black Acura at a nearby gas station.\n\nPolice officers took Depina to the gas station to make a field\n\nidentification.      There, Depina confirmed that the police had\n\ndetained the black Acura and the man in the blue track suit that\n\nhad earlier chased him.    The man in the track suit turned out to be\n\nStonehurst member Manuel \"J\" Lopes.      Depina also identified the\n\ndriver of the vehicle as Angelo Brandao, whom he knew because their\n\nmothers were acquainted.\n\n             Police arrested Brandao and Manuel Lopes and impounded\n\nthe Acura.    A police officer conducting an inventory search of the\n\ncar at the station house discovered a 9mm Ruger with an attached\n\nlaser sight concealed behind a panel in the glove compartment. The\n\ngun was loaded and the safety was off.     Three ballisticians later\n\ndetermined that the gun had been used in the Depina shooting, the\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fDias shooting, and another shooting in which two Stonehurst members\n\nattacked a Wendover member.\n\nE.          Station House Interview\n\n            Police took Brandao, after his arrest, to the Brockton\n\npolice station for questioning in the early morning hours of May\n\n15, 1999, directly following the Depina shooting.               Once at the\n\nstation house, Brandao asked for Massachusetts State Trooper John\n\nDuggan by name.      Duggan had previously met with and questioned\n\nBrandao during the course of his investigation of the Fernandes\n\nmurder.    Brandao signed a waiver of his Miranda rights, and Duggan\n\nand Detective Mark Reardon of the Brockton Police Department began\n\ninterrogating Brandao at 3:15am.\n\n            Brandao appeared calm at first, but when Duggan told\n\nBrandao that the police had located the car used in the Fernandes\n\nshooting and had a witness who identified the people in the car,\n\nBrandao became visibly agitated.         Brandao's eyes welled up and he\n\nput his head on the table.       Brandao asked Duggan, \"Is that the car\n\nthat was in the paper?\"      Early media accounts of the Fernandes\n\nmurder had reported that the shooters drove a red Honda.              When the\n\npolice later learned that the car was in fact a red Dodge, they\n\nwithheld    that   information    from    the   press   to   test    suspects'\n\nknowledge.   When Duggan answered Brandao that it was not the car in\n\nthe papers, Brandao again put his head on the table.           Brandao asked\n\nDuggan, \"What am I looking at, twenty-five to life?                 I can't do\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fthat time.    Even if I tell you what happened, I'm still looking at\n\ntime.\"\n\n             When Duggan mentioned Gus Lopes in connection with the\n\nFernandes shooting, Brandao replied, \"I guess there's nothing left\n\nfor me to do.\"    He then said that he would tell Duggan the details\n\nof the whole story at some point, although he never did.\n\n             In July 2000, after years of orchestrating gang warfare,\n\nGus Lopes was arrested when he attempted to buy guns from an\n\nundercover police officer.       Lopes agreed to cooperate in the\n\ngovernment's prosecution of fellow Stonehurst members in exchange\n\nfor a reduced sentence on the firearms charge.\n\n                                  II.\n\n             On September 30, 2004, a federal grand jury delivered a\n\nsuperseding indictment charging Brandao and twelve others with\n\nmultiple counts of RICO, VICAR, and firearms violations.         The\n\nindictment alleged that Stonehurst was a RICO enterprise, the\n\nactivities of which affected interstate commerce.     The indictment\n\nimputed multiple purposes to the Stonehurst enterprise, including\n\n\"to shoot and kill members, associates, and perceived supporters of\n\n. . . Wendover\" and \"to protect and defend its members and\n\nassociates from acts and threats of violence and to shoot and kill\n\n\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fother people with whom members and associates of the Enterprise\n\nwere engaged in violent or drug-related disputes.\"1\n\n            The   indictment   named   Brandao   individually   in   eight\n\ncounts.    The first two counts were for racketeering, see 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1962(c), and racketeering conspiracy, see id. § 1962(d), both in\n\nviolation of RICO.     The indictment named Brandao in four specific\n\nacts as predicates to the racketeering charge:        (1) conspiracy to\n\nmurder members of Wendover (racketeering Act One); (2) assault with\n\nintent to murder Antonio Dias (racketeering Act Ten); (3) assault\n\nwith intent to murder Alcides Depina (racketeering Act Eleven); and\n\n(4) conspiracy to murder Dinho Fernandes (racketeering Act Twenty).\n\n            The indictment also charged Brandao under VICAR, see id.\n\n§ 1959(a), for committing each of these four violent criminal acts\n\nin aid of racketeering.        The indictment characterized the Dinho\n\nFernandes shooting differently for purposes of the RICO and VICAR\n\ncharges.    While the indictment treated the shooting as \"Murder in\n\nAid of Racketeering\" (emphasis added) for the VICAR charge, the\n\nsame activity was described as \"conspir[acy] to murder Dinho\n\nFernandes\"    (emphasis   added)   for    purposes   of   establishing   a\n\npredicate act under RICO.       Finally, Brandao was charged under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 924(c) for use of a firearm during the Dias and Depina\n\nshootings.\n\n\n     1\n          The indictment also alleged that Stonehurst's activities\nencompassed the sale of crack and marijuana, but the government\nabandoned those charges before Brandao's trial.\n\n                                   -10-\n\f              The   district   court   divided    the    thirteen   Stonehurst\n\ndefendants into groups for trial.             The connections of the first\n\ngroup of defendants are described in Nascimento, 491 F.3d at 30.\n\nBrandao was tried later with one co-defendant, Brima Wurie, who was\n\nacquitted.     On February 9, 2006, following a fourteen-day trial, a\n\njury convicted Brandao on the substantive RICO and RICO conspiracy\n\ncharges.      The jury also convicted Brandao on the VICAR charge of\n\nassault in aid of racketeering based on the Depina shooting and the\n\nassociated firearms charge.\n\n              With respect to the substantive RICO charge, the jury\n\nreturned special findings that the prosecution had proven beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that Brandao had assaulted Alcides Depina with\n\nintent to murder him (racketeering Act Eleven) and conspired to\n\nmurder Dinho Fernandes (racketeering Act Twenty).              The jury found\n\nthat the prosecution had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that\n\nBrandao either conspired to murder Wendover members (racketeering\n\nAct One) or assaulted Antonio Dias with intent to murder him\n\n(racketeering Act Ten).\n\n              Brandao submitted a motion for acquittal or for a new\n\ntrial, which the district court denied in a published opinion on\n\nSeptember 8, 2006.

Specifically,   there   was\n\ninsufficient evidence Brandao had sufficient knowledge there was a\n\nStonehurst gang or that his cousin, Monteiro, was a member of the\n\ngang, in order for him to have been associated with Stonehurst at\n\nthe time of Fernandes's murder.         He concedes the evidence supports\n\nan inference that Brandao knew his cousin had a propensity to\n\ncommit violent crimes, but not that Monteiro's criminality was part\n\nof his gang affiliation with Stonehurst.\n\n              Second, he argues the evidence did not support the jury's\n\nfinding that the Fernandes murder was a purpose or affair of the\n\nStonehurst gang, as opposed to a purely personal dispute.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\f           Third, Brandao argues that the evidence does not support\n\nthe   conclusion   that   the   Dinho   Fernandes   and   Alcides   Depina\n\nshootings constituted a \"pattern of racketeering activity.\"\n\n           a. Association2 -- In order to establish a substantive\n\nRICO violation, the prosecution had to prove that Brandao was\n\n\"associated with\" Stonehurst at the time that he committed the\n\npredicate racketeering acts.        The murder of Fernandes is the\n\npredicate act which concerns us.        The government does not contend\n\nthat Brandao was associated with Stonehurst before March 17, 1999,\n\nbut that he became associated with it by his actions that day.        The\n\nevidence of defendant's association with Stonehurst after Fernandes\n\nwas killed for the remaining shootings which are predicate acts\n\ncannot be seriously questioned.\n\n           Some knowledge of the enterprise is necessary as part of\n\nthe requirement of showing association with the enterprise.          \"The\n\nRICO net is woven tightly to trap even the smallest fish, those\n\nperipherally involved with the enterprise.\" Marino, 277 F.3d at 33\n\n\n      2\n          There is no claim the jury was not properly instructed.\nThe jury instruction here was:\n          A person is associated with an enterprise if\n          he   knowingly   participates,  directly   or\n          indirectly, in the conduct of the affairs of\n          an enterprise. One need not have an official\n          position in the enterprise to be associated\n          with it. One need not formally align himself\n          with an enterprise to associate with it.\n          Association may be by means of an informal or\n          a loose relationship. Mere presence, however,\n          is not enough.\nThe requirement of association with the enterprise is not strict.\n\n                                   -14-\n\f(quoting United States v.

Nascimento, 491 F.3d at 47.\n\n            Brandao makes much of the fact that no direct testimony\n\nat trial explicitly named Brandao as the party who paged Monteiro\n\nat the gas station on the afternoon of the Fernandes murder.                    The\n\nargument is not a strong one.          Even if some individual other than\n\nBrandao    actually    spoke    with    Monteiro      on   the    phone,   it    is\n\nuncontested that as a result of that conversation, Monteiro went to\n\nBrockton to help a cousin of his, and that they went to the home of\n\nBrandao, a cousin of Monteiro's.          They did not go to the home of\n\nBarros, whom defendant argues paged Monteiro.\n\n            Brandao and Monteiro acted together.            Brandao joined his\n\ncousin    Monteiro    at   Brandao's    home    in   a   Honda,   and   then    led\n\nMonteiro's car to the intended victims, where Brandao pointed out\n\nthe victims.    The two cars returned to Brandao's home, then back\n\ntoward where the victims were.           Before reaching the victims, the\n\ntwo cars stopped, and Brandao got out and handed the murder weapon\n\nto his cousin Monteiro.        Brandao returned to his home.            After the\n\nshooting, Monteiro returned to Brandao's home and left the home\n\nunarmed.    This is very strong evidence that Brandao instigated\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\fMonteiro's   trip,   and    the   purpose    of    the   trip     was   to    murder\n\nFernandes.\n\n            As Brandao concedes, the jury had ample cause to find\n\nthat Brandao knew that Monteiro was prone to commit violent crimes.\n\nBrandao did not object or pose any questions when Monteiro brought\n\ntwo other men along to assist in the shooting.             The very lack of a\n\nneed for communication between Brandao and his three fellow gang\n\nmembers is strong evidence of familiarity and common purposes.\n\nThat evidence alone, however, might not be sufficient itself to\n\nshow beyond a reasonable doubt that Brandao knew that his cousin\n\nwas a member of Stonehurst, and that by enlisting Monteiro, Brandao\n\nwas enlisting Stonehurst, the RICO enterprise.\n\n            On all of the evidence, a jury could infer beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that Brandao knew that Monteiro, Lopes, and\n\nRodrigues belonged to the Stonehurst group, and that their group\n\nregularly engaged in shootings of rival gang members. Monteiro and\n\nLopes were gang leaders; leaders are frequently known by name. The\n\nmurder of Bobby Mendes and the ensuing conflict between Stonehurst\n\nand   Wendover   affected    many   members       of   Boston's    Cape      Verdean\n\ncommunity.   Further, Brandao was a cousin to the DeSoto brothers,\n\nwho were embroiled in a separate dispute with a prominent member of\n\nWendover.     Ironically,     another   of    Brandao's         cousins,     Gelson\n\nBrandao, was known to associate with Wendover and was targeted by\n\nStonehurst members, further supporting the inference of Brandao's\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fknowledge of the two gangs and who was a member of which.                     The\n\nvictim was a member of the Cape Verdean community, as was Brandao.\n\nThat makes it unlikely Brandao did not know of Stonehurst or\n\nMonteiro's association with it.\n\n             Brandao argues he lived in Brockton and not in the\n\ngeographic center of the Stonehurst and Wendover groups, which was\n\nin the Dorchester and Roxbury neighborhoods of Boston.                    But the\n\njury heard evidence that Gus Lopes and other Stonehurst members\n\nrepeatedly traveled to Brockton on missions in search of rivals to\n\nshoot.\n\n             The evidence of knowledge goes well beyond the fact that\n\nBrandao may have known of Monteiro's relationship with Stonehurst\n\nmerely because they were cousins.               It is unlikely that when\n\ncommissioning      a   shooting   by   his    cousin,     Brandao   was   unaware\n\nMonteiro's expertise in shooting people came from his being a\n\nStonehurst member.\n\n             The jury could also reach its conclusion based on the\n\nfact that the gun used to kill Fernandes was a gun which had been\n\nused in earlier Stonehurst shootings, and that Brandao had the gun.\n\nAt trial, Gus Lopes testified that he recognized the gun when\n\nBrandao handed it to Monteiro.          In fact, Lopes knew the gun to be\n\none   that   had   been   used    in   at   least   two   previous   Stonehurst\n\nshootings.      Police later found the same gun during a search\n\nincident to the arrest of Stonehurst member Jackson Nascimento.\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\f           The jury could reasonably infer that this network of\n\npersonal and family ties and the possession of a gang gun would put\n\nBrandao on notice of Stonehurst's \"general existence\" and \"related\n\nactivities.\"\n\n           b. Relationship of Fernandes Shooting to Stonehurst --\n\nBrandao argues that the prosecution failed to produce sufficient\n\nevidence   of   relatedness    between     the    Fernandes     murder    and\n\nStonehurst's purposes or affairs to be \"through\" a pattern of\n\nracketeering    activities.     The   prosecution    must   prove   Brandao\n\nparticipated    in   Stonehurst's     affairs    \"through   a   pattern   of\n\nracketeering activity.\" 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). The statute's use of\n\nthe word \"through\" implies \"a nexus between these racketeering acts\n\nand the enterprise.\"     Nascimento, 491 F.3d at 45.          \"A sufficient\n\nnexus or relationship exists between the racketeering acts and the\n\nenterprise if the defendant was able to commit the predicate acts\n\nby means of, by consequence of, by reason of, by the agency of, or\n\nby the instrumentality of his association with the enterprise.\"\n\nMarino, 277 F.3d at 27.\n\n           The jury could reasonably find that the evidence in this\n\ncase fulfills the test.       Brandao did not himself fire the shots\n\nwhich killed Fernandes. Instead, he sought the assistance of three\n\nmembers of Stonehurst who were well-rehearsed in the techniques of\n\ndrive-by shootings.      Brandao quite literally conspired to kill\n\n\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\fFernandes \"by the agency of\" and \"by the instrumentality of his\n\nassociation with\" three members of Stonehurst.\n\n            If that were not enough, the \"nexus or relationship\" test\n\nmay be met by proof that \"the resources, property, or facilities of\n\nthe enterprise are used by the defendant to commit the predicate\n\nacts.\"   Id. at 28.       The gun used to kill Fernandes was such a\n\nresource.    The gun that killed Fernandes passed from the ownership\n\nand control of Stonehurst members to Brandao and back again.\n\nEvidence that a gun shared amongst Stonehurst members killed\n\nFernandes could permit a rational jury to find a relationship\n\nbetween the shooting and Stonehurst itself.\n\n            Brandao mounts a similar attack based on the third\n\nelement of RICO culpability requiring that a defendant participate\n\nin the conduct of the enterprise's affairs. Brandao cites Reves v.\n\nErnst & Young, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112826\"><a href=\"/opinion/112826/reves-v-ernst-young/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">170</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1993), for the proposition that\n\nliability under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) \"depends on showing that the\n\ndefendants    conducted    or   participated   in   the   conduct   of   the\n\n'enterprise's affairs,' not just their own affairs.\"          Id. at 185.\n\nBrandao interprets this language as foreclosing RICO liability for\n\npredicate acts undertaken for personal motivations.\n\n            The argument takes Reves out of context.          At issue in\n\nReves was the liability of an outside accounting firm with a mere\n\ncontractual relationship with the corrupt enterprise.          See id. at\n\n186.   Cases involving \"outsiders\" to the enterprise as defendants\n\n\n                                   -20-\n\fare   different    from   those   involving       \"insiders\"    as   defendants.\n\nUnited States v. Houlihan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196936\"><a href=\"/opinion/196936/united-states-v-houlihan/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1271</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1298-99 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\nInsiders     --   those    \"who   are     integral    to     carrying   out   the\n\nenterprise's racketeering activities\" -- by definition participate\n\nin the conduct of the enterprise.              Id. at 1299.\n\n           The jury in this case heard evidence that the Fernandes\n\nshooting   was    related   to    Stonehurst's       affairs.     The   criminal\n\nenterprise    here   had     particularly        malleable     purposes.      The\n\nindictment defined that purpose in part as being \"to shoot and kill\n\nother people with whom members and associates of [Stonehurst] were\n\nengaged in violent or drug-related disputes.\"              The jury rationally\n\ncould have concluded that the purpose of the murder of Fernandes\n\nwas to kill someone with whom an associate of Stonehurst had a\n\nviolent dispute.\n\n           When asked why he participated in the Fernandes shooting,\n\nGus Lopes testified, \"Because Manny was my boy, and that's his\n\ncousin, and I'm going to help Manny with whatever problem he's\n\ngot.\"   The jury could have interpreted this statement as a simple\n\nexpression of personal loyalty, but also could have concluded\n\notherwise.     The other evidence supported an inference that Lopes\n\nwas motivated by a desire for a quid pro quo that would benefit\n\nStonehurst's interests and further the campaign against Wendover.\n\nMarcelino Rodrigues, a Stonehurst member who was incarcerated in\n\nmid-1999, testified that Gus Lopes visited him in prison and told\n\n\n                                        -21-\n\fhim   about    his   new   acquaintance,    Angelo    Brandao.     Lopes   told\n\nRodrigues that \"they both did favors for each other,\" with Lopes\n\noperating in Boston and Brandao reciprocating in Brockton.                 That\n\ntestimony     was    consistent   with   Lopes's     assertion   that   Brandao\n\n\"became part of Stonehurst\" on the occasion of the Fernandes\n\nshooting.\n\n              c. Pattern of Racketeering Activity -- Brandao next\n\nargues that the prosecution presented insufficient evidence of a\n\n\"pattern\" of racketeering activity on his part.            A RICO conviction\n\nrequires proof of \"at least two acts of racketeering activity\" over\n\na period of ten years.3        18 U.S.C. § 1961(5).        More than numbers\n\nare required to establish a \"pattern\" of racketeering acts. \"It is\n\nnot the number of predicates but the relationship that they bear to\n\neach other or to some external organizing principle that renders\n\nthem\" a pattern.

Thus, two or more racketeering predicates constitute a\n\n\"pattern\" if they are (1) \"related\" and (2) \"amount to or pose a\n\nthreat of continued criminal activity.\"            Id. at 239.\n\n              The \"relatedness\" prong may be satisfied by proof that\n\nthe predicate acts \"have the same or similar purposes, results,\n\nparticipants, victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are\n\n\n\n      3\n          There must have been at least two predicate acts in order\nto make out a pattern under RICO.

The jury could have\n\nreasonably concluded that Brandao and Manuel Lopes targeted Alcides\n\nDepina for his perceived loyalties, however attenuated, to members\n\nof Wendover.\n\n               In addition, both the Fernandes and Depina shootings\n\nshared distinguishing characteristics common to Stonehurst.                      Three\n\nprominent       members    of    the   gang    assisted      Brandao    in    killing\n\nFernandes, while another member accompanied Brandao on the attack\n\nagainst Depina.       Each of those shootings involved guns shared by\n\nStonehurst       members     and   implicated      in     multiple     gang-related\n\nshootings.          Both        incidents      involved      drive-by        shootings\n\ncharacteristic of Stonehurst's \"missions\" to hunt and kill Wendover\n\nrivals.\n\n\n                                        -23-\n\f          Brandao argues, in essence, that the Fernandes and Depina\n\nshootings cannot form a \"pattern\" because they were not directly\n\nrelated to each other.    This argument misses the mark.   Whether\n\nBrandao's motivations for conspiring to kill Dinho Fernandes and\n\nassisting in the assault on Alcides Depina were the same, whether\n\nidentical Stonehurst members accompanied Brandao on both outings,\n\nand whether the same gun or car were used in each attack are not\n\ndispositive.   Rather, the attacks' relatedness to Stonehurst, its\n\npurposes, its members, and its methods provides the \"external\n\norganizing principle\" behind both acts.\n\n          Likewise, there was sufficient evidence for a finding\n\nthat Brandao's participation with Stonehurst posed a \"threat of\n\ncontinued criminal activity.\"\n\n          [T]he threat of continuity may be established\n          by showing that the predicate acts or offenses\n          are part of an ongoing entity's regular way of\n          doing   business.     Thus,   the  threat   of\n          continuity is sufficiently established where\n          the predicates can be attributed to a\n          defendant operating as part of a long-term\n          association that exists for criminal purposes.\n\nH.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 242-43.\n\n          Here, Stonehurst engaged in a long-term campaign of\n\nviolence aimed at killing members of Wendover and other enemies of\n\nStonehurst members.   Once Brandao joined the group, he met with\n\nStonehurst members several times a week with the aim of \"helping\n\n[them] with shootings.\"   The jury found that Brandao participated\n\nin the Depina shooting and heard evidence that he participated in\n\n                                 -24-\n\fthe Dias shooting, acts for which Brandao's only motivation was his\n\nrelationship with Stonehurst.         Once Brandao associated with the\n\nenterprise, his violent activity would continue as long as that\n\nassociation continued.\n\n              2.      RICO Conspiracy\n\n              Brandao argues that there was insufficient evidence to\n\nsupport the RICO conspiracy conviction for all of the reasons given\n\nabove that the substantive RICO conviction must be vacated.             Those\n\narguments fail, as does the argument that there was no agreement to\n\njoin the RICO conspiracy, as we have just held.\n\n              3.      Second VICAR Count\n\n              Brandao alleges there was insufficient evidence to show,\n\nunder the second VICAR count, that his shooting of Alcides Depina,\n\non May 14, 1999, was motivated by a purpose of maintaining or\n\nincreasing his position in Stonehurst.\n\n              VICAR prohibits \"assault with a dangerous weapon\" for\n\n\"the purpose of . . . maintaining or increasing position in an\n\nenterprise engaged in racketeering activity.\" 18 U.S.C. § 1959(a).\n\nThis circuit has defined the motive requirement in VICAR as a\n\ngeneral one, satisfied by proof either that the crime was committed\n\nin furtherance of defendant's membership in the enterprise or\n\nbecause it was expected of him by reason of his membership.

The defendant argues that his motive\n\nwas personal, and not gang affiliated.           He says Depina was not an\n\nenemy of Stonehurst, and Depina was shot as a result of Brandao's\n\nrelationship with DeSoto, which led to Brandao's dispute with\n\nGomes, which led to the shooting.

By the time of the Depina\n\nshooting in May of 1999, Brandao had, a jury could find, been a\n\nmember of Stonehurst for just two months and, anxious to earn his\n\nspurs, he had been helping with shootings.              Soon after Lopes, the\n\ngang leader, told Brandao about problems with Gomes and Dias,\n\n\n                                       -26-\n\fBrandao was out with other gang members shooting at Depina, using\n\na gun and a car previously used in gang shootings.                         A jury could\n\neasily      conclude       that   Brandao    did    so     to    impress   and   further\n\ningratiate himself with the gang leader.\n\nB.            Constructive Amendment\n\n              Brandao argues that the indictment was constructively\n\namended.       The error here was that the jury instruction as to\n\nracketeering Act Twenty charged the substantive crime of murder\n\n(the murder of Dinho Fernandes), even though the grand jury's\n\nindictment had only charged conspiracy to murder.4                           Conspiracy\n\nrequires the element of agreement, which murder does not. The jury\n\nverdict      form    also    described      the    count    as    murder   rather       than\n\nconspiracy to murder.             The jury found this racketeering act was\n\nproven beyond a reasonable doubt as to Brandao.\n\n              The     district       court        distributed       its    draft        jury\n\ninstructions to counsel more than a week before the jury was\n\ncharged      and    held    two   conferences       on   the     instructions      in    the\n\ninterim, yet Brandao did not object to the instruction or verdict\n\nform as to racketeering Act Twenty.                  Brandao, 448 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n317.       Brandao first raised the constructive amendment issue in a\n\n\n\n\n       4\n          This problem was created by the poor drafting of the\nindictment. Racketeering Act Twenty was titled \"Murder of Dinho\nFernandes,\" even though it charged that Brandao and others\n\"willfully and knowingly did conspire to murder\" Fernandes. See\nBrandao, 448 F. Supp. 2d at 316-17.\n\n                                            -27-\n\fpost-trial motion, which the district court denied.5                     Id. at 317,\n\n326.\n\n            As    an     unpreserved      objection,      Brandao's     constructive\n\namendment claim is subject to plain error review.

Olano, 507 U.S. at 735.   In this context, the\n\nCourt referred to structural errors -- constitutional errors that\n\ndeprive the defendant of a fundamentally fair trial and thus may\n\nnot be found harmless under Rule 52(a)'s harmless error standard --\n\nand \"those errors that should be presumed prejudicial if the\n\ndefendant cannot make a specific showing of prejudice.\"6   Id.

We agree with those circuits that apply the\n\nstandard prejudice evaluation to constructive amendment claims on\n\nplain error review and do not presume prejudice.       We do so for\n\nseveral reasons.\n\n          First, the Supreme Court's jurisprudence is increasingly\n\nwary of recognizing new structural errors or otherwise establishing\n\nper se outcomes under plain error review.   When listing structural\n\nerrors in recent cases, the Court has not included constructive\n\namendments.   See Washington v.

Clark,   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111750\"><a href=\"/opinion/111750/rose-v-clark/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span>   <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>   <span class=\"page\">570</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,   579   (1986))   (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). In recent years, the Court has routinely\n\nrejected arguments that additional specific categories of errors\n\nshould be considered structural errors.              See, e.g., id. at 8\n\n(omission of element of offense in jury instructions); Fulminante,\n\n499 U.S. at 310-11 (collecting cases).         This unwillingness is even\n\nmore pronounced in the plain error context, with the Court bluntly\n\nstating that \"[a] per se approach to plain-error review is flawed.\"\n\nYoung, 470 U.S. at 16 n.14.           In keeping with this trend, this\n\ncourt, sitting en banc in Padilla, refused to expand the category\n\nof structural errors beyond those already recognized by the Supreme\n\nCourt, noting the category has been reserved for a very limited\n\nclass of cases involving \"only the most pervasive and debilitating\n\nerrors.\"   415 F.3d at 219.\n\n           Second, there are good reasons not to extend the list of\n\nstructural errors to include constructive amendments. Constructive\n\namendments come in many varieties: some constructive amendments\n\nbroaden indictments; some effectively narrow indictments.             In many\n\ncases, constructive amendments will not be the sort of error that\n\nwill \"deprive defendants of 'basic protections' without which a\n\n'criminal trial cannot reliably serve its function as a vehicle for\n\n\n                                      -36-\n\fdetermining guilt or innocence . . . and no criminal punishment may\n\nbe regarded as fundamentally fair.'\"                  Neder, 527 U.S. at 8-9\n\n(quoting    Rose,    478   U.S.    at    577-78).      We   believe   this    case\n\ndemonstrates that point. Because the term \"constructive amendment\"\n\nincludes a number of different types of errors, some of which will\n\nnot always be prejudicial, the term \"constructive amendment\" does\n\nnot create a good candidate for departing from usual plain error\n\nreview. Cf. id. at 14 (describing approach to structural errors as\n\ntraditionally       categorical:    \"a    constitutional     error    is    either\n\nstructural or it is not\").          Labels like \"constructive amendment\"\n\nshould rarely dictate outcomes.                We also agree with the Fifth\n\nCircuit that abandoning the usual plain error rule will create\n\nperverse incentives which may harm the administration of the\n\ncriminal justice system.          See Fletcher, 121 F.3d at 193; see also\n\nFloresca, 38 F.3d at 727 (Russell, J., dissenting).\n\n            Third, Stirone does not, as defendant argues, compel a\n\ncontrary conclusion. In Stirone, a union official was charged with\n\nviolating the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1951, by interfering with\n\ninterstate commerce through extortion.                361 U.S. at 213.        The\n\nindictment charged Stirone with obstructing shipments of sand to\n\nPennsylvania to make concrete to build steel mills, but the judge\n\nallowed    the   government   to     argue     that   Stirone's   actions     also\n\naffected interstate commerce by interfering with the steel mill's\n\nability to ship steel from Pennsylvania.              Id. at 213-14.       Because\n\n\n                                        -37-\n\fthe jury was allowed to convict on either theory of interference\n\nwith interstate commerce, and because the indictment had made no\n\nmention of the second theory, it was possible that Stirone had been\n\nconvicted on a charge not made (and not intended) by the grand\n\njury.     Id. at 214, 218-19.             The Supreme Court reversed the\n\nconviction,      holding    that    the   trial    court    had   impermissibly\n\nbroadened the indictment in violation of defendant's constitutional\n\nrights.    Id. at 219.\n\n            Significantly, Stirone did not involve the issue which\n\nconfronts us here: in Stirone, the objection to the constructive\n\namendment was preserved; the case did not involve plain error\n\nreview at all.11         361 U.S. at 214.         Under modern Supreme Court\n\njurisprudence, the difference between harmless error and plain\n\nerror review is a meaningful one.          See, e.g., Johnson, 520 U.S. at\n\n469-70 (even structural errors are subject to plain error review's\n\nfourth prong).\n\n            We    also     note    that   the     Supreme   Court   has   never\n\nspecifically resolved \"the more sophisticated question of whether\n\na structural error necessarily affects substantial rights, thereby\n\nautomatically satisfying the third element of the plain error\n\ntest.\"    Padilla, 415 F.3d at 220 n.1.           Some courts have concluded\n\nthat errors that cannot be harmless must also be per se prejudicial\n\n\n     11\n          The government argues Stirone may have involved, in\ntoday's terminology, a variance and not a constructive amendment.\nWe do not address the issue.\n\n                                      -38-\n\funder Olano's third prong.     See id. (collecting cases).             But that\n\nis not a necessary outcome.         See, e.g., Syme, 276 F.3d at 152\n\n(noting that per se reversal rule for preserved errors might not\n\nextend to plain error review); Remsza, 77 F.3d at 1044 (noting that\n\ncircuit's rule requiring prejudice analysis for all errors on plain\n\nerror   review);   Floresca,   38     F.3d    at    722-23       (Russell,    J.,\n\ndissenting) (disagreeing with majority's presumption that errors\n\nnot subject to harmless error review will also not necessitate a\n\nshowing of prejudice under plain error review).                   Thus even if\n\nStirone does require automatic reversal of constructive amendments\n\nfor preserved claims of error on harmless error review, that would\n\nnot necessarily mean that prejudice should be presumed on plain\n\nerror review.\n\n          Further, the Court has not extended Stirone's per se\n\nreversal approach to closely related situations.                 See Neder, 527\n\nU.S. at 8 (omission of element of offense in jury charge not a\n\nstructural   error);   Johnson,   520      U.S.    at   469-70    (refusing    to\n\nexercise discretion under Olano's fourth prong where trial court\n\nfailed to submit element of offense to jury); United States v.\n\nMiller, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111404\"><a href=\"/opinion/111404/united-states-v-miller/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">130</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 145 (1985) (finding no violation of grand\n\njury right where charges in indictment were broader than proof\n\npresented at trial).     The facts of this case make it likewise\n\ndistinguishable from Stirone, as discussed below.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -39-\n\f            We also decline to alter the usual plain error standard\n\nto provide defendant with a presumption of prejudice that would\n\nshift the burden to the government to show lack of prejudice.            We\n\nsee no basis in Supreme Court holdings to do so.12              We will not\n\nconclude that in all cases it will be \"well-nigh impossible to\n\ndetermine    the   amount   of   harm\"   resulting   from   a   constructive\n\namendment.    United States v. Mojica-Baez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770724\"><a href=\"/opinion/770724/united-states-v-john-alexis-mojica-baez-united-states-of-america-v-josue/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">292</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 309 (1st\n\nCir. 2000).    We believe that, depending on the facts of a given\n\ncase, some constructive amendments will, by their nature and from\n\nthe risks they create for defendant, be so great that a reviewing\n\ncourt may find the requisite prejudice under Olano's third prong.\n\n            We hold that the defendant must make the required showing\n\nof prejudice under Olano and its progeny.            Defendant here cannot\n\nmeet his burden.     Defendant views the error as involving primarily\n\nhis Fifth Amendment rights to a grand jury indictment; the district\n\ncourt viewed the error as involving primarily defendant's Sixth\n\nAmendment rights.     However considered, this constructive amendment\n\ndid not seriously jeopardize defendant's rights and did not present\n\na reasonable probability of affecting the outcome of the district\n\ncourt proceedings.\n\n            As the district court astutely pointed out, here, \"unlike\n\nStirone, Defendant was not charged with an act not alleged at all\n\n\n     12\n          We acknowledge the Third and the Fourth Circuits'\nargument that there is such a basis based on dicta in Olano. See\nSyme, 276 F.3d at 153; Floresca, 28 F.3d at 713 n.16.\n\n                                    -40-\n\fin the indictment.\"       Brandao, 448 F. Supp. 2d at 319.            Although\n\nracketeering Act Twenty under Count Two of the indictment charged\n\nconspiracy to murder, and not murder, the grand jury alleged in\n\nCount Thirty-Three that Brandao murdered Fernandes when it charged\n\nthat Brandao committed the murder to maintain or increase his\n\nposition in the Stonehurst enterprise. We do not have to speculate\n\nwhether the grand jury would have indicted Brandao for the actual\n\nmurder of Fernandes; in practical terms it did.               Cf. Stirone, 361\n\nU.S. at 217 (noting that no court \"can know that the grand jury\n\nwould   have   been   willing    to   charge\"     defendant   on   grounds    not\n\nmentioned in indictment but presented to petit jury); Thomas, 274\n\nF.3d at 670 (warning against speculating what a grand jury might\n\nhave charged in its indictment).        We thus have no concerns that the\n\ngrand jury would have returned a conforming indictment charging\n\nmurder.   For the same reason, Brandao was provided adequate notice\n\nof the charges against him.       Cf. Miller, 471 U.S. at 134-35 (noting\n\nlack of notice concerns in finding no error where variance narrowed\n\nindictment); Hugs, 384 F.3d at 768 (finding no prejudice where\n\nindictment     provided   fair    notice     of   evidence     that   would   be\n\nintroduced at trial).\n\n           The district court also cogently explained why the error\n\ncould not have affected the trial's outcome: given the evidence at\n\ntrial, the jury could not have found Brandao guilty of murder (the\n\namended charge) if it had not also found he had colluded with\n\n\n                                      -41-\n\fothers to carry out the murder.               \"Because the government never\n\nsuggested that Defendant pulled the trigger, an agreement was a\n\nnecessary condition of the jury's finding Defendant guilty of the\n\nsubstantive murder via an aiding and abetting theory.\"                   Brandao,\n\n448 F. Supp. 2d at 323-24.13\n\n             Indeed, as the district court and the government have\n\nnoted,     this    case   resembles    those     cases   in   which   the    court\n\nerroneously omits an element of an offense when instructing the\n\njury (here the element of agreement).             See id. at 324.     Given the\n\nevidence at trial and the jury's actual verdict, the record could\n\nnot \"rationally lead to a contrary finding with respect to the\n\nomitted element,\" the prejudice analysis applied in Neder.                        527\n\nU.S. at 19.\n\n             This case does not raise concerns of adequate notice, of\n\nwhether the grand jury would have indicted on the amended charge,\n\nor   of    material   unfairness      to   the   defendant.      There      was   no\n\nprejudice.        We add, but do not rely on, our view that Brandao's\n\nclaim would fail in any event under the fourth prong of the plain\n\nerror test.\n\n\n      13\n          The fact that the jury acquitted Brandao on Count Thirty-\nThree does not call this reasoning into doubt. As the district\ncourt explained, the jury could have found Brandao guilty of\nmurdering Fernandes while not also finding that, as required for a\nVICAR conviction, he committed the murder to maintain or improve\nhis position in Stonehurst.     Brandao, 448 F. Supp. 2d at 320.\nRather, the evidence presented at trial could have allowed the jury\nto find that Brandao's participation in the Fernandes murder\nprovided Brandao's entry into the Stonehurst enterprise.

Prosecutor's Closing Arguments\n\n            Brandao argues that the prosecutor made improper comments\n\nin closing, and those remarks so offended defendant's due process\n\nrights as to deny him a fair trial.         The usual test is whether the\n\nprosecutor's misconduct \"'so poisoned the well' that the trial's\n\noutcome was likely affected.\"          United States v.

Hernández, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769364\"><a href=\"/opinion/769364/united-states-v-jose-ramon-hernandez-united-states-of-america-v-douglas/\"><span class=\"volume\">218</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 68-69 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n            The second claim is that the prosecution broadened the\n\nindictment when, during rebuttal, at closing, the prosecutor said,\n\n\"any problem of a member was the gang's problem.\"         The argument was\n\n\n                                   -43-\n\fmade in response to a key theme in the defense's closing: that each\n\nof the charged shootings was personal and therefore unconnected\n\nwith the RICO enterprise. It was fair for the prosecution to argue\n\nthat merely because there was some personal benefit from a shooting\n\ndid not mean the shooting was unconnected from the enterprise.\n\nWhile it is not literally true in the abstract that any problem of\n\na member was the gang's problem, in context, there is no reason to\n\nbelieve the jury took the government to be arguing that.\n\n            The prosecutor did overstate in its closing, in one\n\nsentence    made    in   anticipation   of   a   defense   argument.   The\n\nprosecutor said the \"shootings . . . were related to the affairs of\n\nthe enterprise and were to protect people in order to carry on\n\ntheir business, in order to recruit.\" (Emphasis added.) While the\n\nstatement may be true in other cases, the government, on appeal,\n\nadmits there was no evidence that Stonehurst tried to recruit\n\nBrandao.    But attorneys for both sides misspeak during closings,\n\nand there is no reason to think this lone comment had any effect on\n\nthe jury.

Denial of Motion for a New Trial: Claim the Government\n          Suppressed Impeachment Material\n\n          The district court rejected Brandao's motion for a new\n\ntrial based on his claim that the government suppressed potential\n\nimpeachment evidence in violation of Brady v.

Review of the district court's\n\ndecision to deny a defendant's motion for a new trial on the basis\n\nof alleged Brady violations is for manifest abuse of discretion.\n\nUnited States v. Morales-Rodríguez, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 14 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n          The court found there was no bad faith involved in the\n\nprosecution's failure to learn and to disclose that Lopes, its key\n\nwitness, had a new state criminal conviction, after it had told the\n\ndefense about the underlying state charges.       Such a conviction\n\nviolated his federal plea agreement and yet he was not punished.\n\nThis would have given defense counsel an argument to counter the\n\ngovernment's assertion that Lopes's plea agreement gave him every\n\nincentive to tell the truth for fear of punishment.\n\n          The court found that while there was some impeachment\n\nvalue to the evidence, the evidence was cumulative of a great deal\n\nof other evidence that Lopes had incentive to lie.   Brandao, 448 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 328.    But the court also noted that Lopes's basic story\n\nabout the events in this case had not changed over the four years\n\nbefore trial.      Id.    And Lopes's testimony was reinforced by\n\n                                 -45-\n\fBrandao's own statements to the police, by ballistics evidence, and\n\nby the discovery of a firearm in the car Brandao drove for the\n\nDepina shooting.     Id.\n\n           There was no abuse of discretion in finding this omission\n\nwas not material.\n\nE.         Sentencing\n\n           The district court sentenced Brandao to a total sentence\n\nof   333   months'      imprisonment,      rejecting     the    government's\n\nrecommendations    that    would   have    effectively    amounted    to   life\n\nimprisonment.    To Brandao's benefit, the court imposed concurrent\n\ntwenty-year sentences on the two RICO counts (reduced for time\n\nserved) and added the mandatory consecutive ten-year sentence on\n\nthe VICAR count.     The court then adjusted the twenty-year sentence\n\ndownward by subtracting twenty-seven months to account for the time\n\nBrandao spent in state custody on the Depina shooting.               The court\n\nordered a five-year period of supervised release and ordered\n\nrestitution of $6,955 to Dinho Fernandes's family to pay for the\n\nfuneral service.\n\n           Brandao argues that the sentence was unreasonable because\n\nit was disproportionate to his activities and criminal history and\n\nbecause it created an unwarranted disparity with other defendants,\n\nmore culpable, he says, than he.\n\n           The   district   judge   presided    over     and   sentenced    the\n\ndefendants in both this and the Nascimento case.                   The court\n\n\n                                    -46-\n\fthoughtfully explained its rationale for the sentence.                     The fact\n\nthat the court did not explicitly mention the 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)\n\nsentencing    factors    means    nothing      in   this   case,    as    the   court\n\nobviously considered them. See United States v. Alli, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202173\"><a href=\"/opinion/202173/united-states-v-alli/\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n41 (1st Cir. 2006) (affirming sentence where district court did not\n\nexplicitly address any of the § 3553(a) factors individually).\n\n             The court addressed both Brandao's particular activities\n\nin the commission of the crime and his criminal history.                  The court\n\ntook into account that Brandao did not shoot Fernandes and that\n\nMonteiro did.      The judge considered the defendant's lack of a\n\ncriminal record and could find no reason in his background to\n\nexplain Brandao's crimes. The court also considered Brandao's luck\n\nthat Lopes was a \"lousy shot\" and did not manage to kill Depina.\n\nThe court also recognized that Stonehurst gunned down people for\n\ntrivial gripes, leading to longstanding and senseless violence in\n\nthe community.\n\n             As to the supposed disparity with the other Stonehurst\n\ndefendants,     the     court    also     considered       and     explained     the\n\ndispositions for the other players: those were largely driven by\n\nthe prosecution's charging decisions, the strength of the evidence\n\nagainst the various defendants, and the fact that Monteiro pled\n\nguilty while Brandao chose to go to trial.             The court's conclusion\n\nthat   the    players    were    not    similarly     situated      was    entirely\n\nreasonable.     See United States v.

I concur with the\n\nmajority's sufficiency of the evidence analysis and its conclusion\n\nthat   we    should    apply       the    standard      prejudice    framework    to\n\nconstructive amendment claims on plain error review and not presume\n\nprejudice.     However, I adopt that conclusion only because of my\n\nagreement    with     the    majority     that   many    so-called    constructive\n\namendment claims lend themselves readily to ordinary plain error\n\nanalysis.    This case illustrates that point well.\n\n            For me, this rationale alone justifies our conclusion\n\nthat the standard prejudice framework should apply to unpreserved\n\nconstructive amendment claims.               I specifically do not join the\n\nmajority's analysis of the Supreme Court's jurisprudence related to\n\nstructural    errors        and   the    compatibility     of   a   presumption   of\n\nprejudice with the Supreme Court's plain error jurisprudence.                     In\n\nmy view, that analysis is not essential to our conclusion on the\n\nconsequences of a constructive amendment that was not the subject\n\nof a timely objection.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -49-\n\f</pre>",
