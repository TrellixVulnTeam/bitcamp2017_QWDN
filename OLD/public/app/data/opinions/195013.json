We vacate the  district court judgment and remand for\n\nfurther proceedings.\n\n                                I\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          The  relevant facts  are  recited  in  the  light  most\n\nfavorable to SMA.   O'Connor v. Steeves, 994  F.2d 905, 907  (1st\n                                       \n\nCir. 1993).   V lez was diagnosed with  multiple sclerosis around\n\n1983.   Sometime in 1986,  V lez and his  wife attended a  dinner\n\nparty at the home of their neighbor, Isidro Ortiz Pep n.  Amongst\n\na group of people at the party, V lez's wife  made comments about\n\nher husband's health.  There  is no evidence that Ortiz overheard\n\nor  participated in  the conversation,  nor that Ortiz  was aware\n\nV lez had multiple sclerosis.1\n\n          Shortly  thereafter,  Ortiz,  who was  neither  an  SMA\n\nemployee nor authorized to sell its insurance, arranged for V lez\n\nto meet with Luis R. Montes, an SMA  agent.  There was no discus-\n\nsion of  V lez's condition  at their meeting  and Montes  was not\n\n                    \n\n     1There is evidence that Ortiz learned that V lez was experi-\nencing  \"achaques,\" a Spanish word roughly equivalent to \"general\naches and pains.\"\n\nmade  aware of  V lez's  \"achaques\"  or  the  multiple  sclerosis\n\ndiagnosis.\n\n          V lez represented on the SMA insurance application that\n\nhe had  not been diagnosed  with, or received treatment  for, any\n           \n\nnerve  disorder (viz., multiple  sclerosis) during  the preceding\n                     \n\nten years.  On November 24, 1986,  SMA issued a disability-income\n\ninsurance policy designating V lez as the insured.\n\n          In  June  of  1989, V lez,  claiming  total disability,\n\napplied  for benefits under the SMA policy.  Based on the alleged\n\nmaterial  misstatement by V lez in the insurance application, SMA\n\nrefused  to pay  on the  policy and  refunded all  premiums, with\n\ninterest.  Whereupon, V lez brought the present action.\n\n          Following  discovery, the  parties filed  cross-motions\n\nfor summary  judgment.   V lez contended  that  the two-year  bar\n\nperiod for contesting the policy had  expired, and, further, that\n\nSMA  was estopped  from contesting  the  policy based  on V lez's\n\npreexisting medical  condition  because  Ortiz,  allegedly  SMA's\n\nagent, had known at the time the policy was issued that V lez was\n\nsuffering  from multiple  sclerosis.   According to  SMA, on  the\n\nother  hand,  the  incontestability  clause  tolled  the two-year\n\nperiod while V lez  was disabled, V lez became disabled less than\n\ntwo years after  the policy went into effect  and, therefore, SMA\n\nwas still entitled to contest the policy.\n\n          The  district court found  for V lez on  the incontest-\n\nability clause issue and two other liability theories.  See V lez\n                                                                 \n\n                                4\n\nGom z  v. SMA  Life Assur. Co.,  793 F.

Goldman v. First Nat'l Bank, 985 F.2d 1113, 1116\n                                            \n\n(1st  Cir.  1993).   Summary  judgment is  appropriate  where the\n\nrecord,  viewed in  the light  most favorable  to the  non-moving\n\nparty,  reveals no  trialworthy  issue of  material fact  and the\n\nmoving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Id.2\n                                                             \n\n1.   The Incontestability Clause.\n                                \n\n          Incontestability  clauses  set  temporal limits  on  an\n\ninsurer's  right to  challenge  its  insurance  policy  based  on\n\nalleged  misstatements in  the insurance  application.   The  SMA\n\nincontestability  clause,  a  simplified  version  of  the  model\n\ncontained in the  Puerto Rico Insurance Code, see  P.R. Laws Ann.\n                                                 \n\ntit. 26,   1606 (1977), provides:\n\n          (a) After this  policy has been in  force for\n          two years during your lifetime (excluding any\n                                                       \n          period during which you are disabled),  [SMA]\n                                              \n          will not  be able  to contest the  statements\n          made in the application.\n\n                    \n\n     2Contrary to  V lez's novel  contention, SMA's  cross-motion\nfor summary judgment does not estop it from claiming that genuine\nissues of material fact precluded summary judgment against SMA.\n                                                              \n\n                                5\n\n(Emphasis added.)  The quoted parenthetical governs this case.3\n\n          The district court found the parenthetical ambiguous as\n\nto  \"whether  . . . disability  is  determined from  the  time of\n\nactual physical  disability, or  . . . from the  time of  the in-\n\nsurer's notice of disability.\"  V lez Gom z,  793 F. Supp. at 381\n                                           \n\n(emphasis  added).   On  appeal, SMA  contends that  the district\n\ncourt improvised ambiguity where there was none.\n\n          The insurance policy is to be interpreted in accordance\n\nwith Puerto Rico law recently surveyed by this court:\n\n               Under  Puerto  Rico law,  the  Insurance\n          Code of Puerto  Rico, 26 L.P.R.A.     101, et\n          seq., controls  the interpretation  of insur-\n          ance contracts.

As a  general matter, ordinary rules of construction\n\napply to incontestability clauses.  1A J. Appleman, Insurance Law\n                                                                 \n\nand Practice,   311 at  313 (1981) (hereinafter Appleman);  18 G.\n                                                        \n\nCouch, Couch on Insurance 2d    72:9 (rev. ed. 1983) (hereinafter\n                            \n\nCouch).\n     \n\n          The  first  interpretive  waymark, of  course,  is  the\n\nlanguage of the parenthetical tolling provision itself:  \"exclud-\n                                                                 \n\ning any period  during which you are disabled,\" where  we find no\n                                             \n\nambiguity whatever.  Rather,  the parenthetical straightforwardly\n\ntolls the  running of the two-year period for the duration of any\n\ndisability  commencing  within  it.   When  \"the  wording  of the\n\ncontract is  explicit and  its language is  clear, its  terms and\n\nconditions are binding on the parties.\"   Nieves, 964 F.2d at  63\n                                                \n\n(citations omitted).\n\n          Related  provisions  within  the  four  corners of  the\n\npolicy  likewise  counsel  a common-sense  reading  of  the plain\n\nlanguage of the tolling provision.  First, the  term \"disability\"\n\nis  defined in the policy as \"injury or sickness [that] makes you\n\nunable to engage in your regular  occupation.\"  Thus, the date of\n\n                                7\n\ndisability is  the relevant tolling  event.  There is  nothing to\n\nsuggest  that  post-disability  notification of  the  insurer  is\n\ngermane to the  tolling inquiry.   Second, our interpretation  of\n\nthe  parenthetical in paragraph  (a) comports precisely  with the\n\nlanguage in companion paragraph (b):\n\n          (b) [SMA] will not be able  to reduce or deny\n          any claim  for disability which  starts after\n                                                 \n          two  years from the date of issue because the\n          disease or physical  condition existed before\n          the date of issue.  \n\n(Emphasis added.)   The hand-and-glove fit between  these coordi-\n\nnate provisions is completely undone by V lez's interpretation.\n\n          The parenthetical is adapted from a standardized incon-\n\ntestability clause  mandated by  statute in  at least  forty-five\n\nstates, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, in\n\naddition to Puerto  Rico.  We consider it  significant that every\n\nother court that has considered the matter to date has arrived at\n\nthe interpretation  urged by  SMA, and no  court has  suggested a\n\nnotification requirement.   See, e.g., Wischmeyer v.  Paul Revere\n                                                                 \n\nLife Ins.  Co., 725  F. Supp.  995, 998  (S.D.

In  mandating a  contractual period  of repose  on insurer\n\nchallenges to disability-income  insurance policies predicated on\n\nalleged misrepresentations in the insurance application, legisla-\n\ntures  accommodate the interests  of both insurers  and insureds,\n\nbased  on two competing  policies:  promoting  insurance security\n\nand deterring insurance  fraud.  See Appleman,    311 at 305-306;\n                                             \n\nsee also Couch,    72:16.  Thus, after  the contestability period\n              \n\nhas  run, the insurer  cannot withdraw insurance  protection even\n                                                                 \n\nthough the insurance application contained misstatements.  On the\n      \n\nother hand, to  better forfend against the occasional insured who\n\nwould perpetrate  fraud  at the  expense  of insurers  and  their\n\nfellow insurance consumers, the contractual limitations period is\n\ntolled  for  the duration  of any  disability arising  within the\n\nrelativelybriefcontestabilityperiodfollowingissuanceofthepolicy.4\n\n                    \n\n     4As the Wischmeyer court explained:\n                       \n\n          The clause protects an insured who is healthy\n          enough to work throughout the two-year period\n          from losing  the security  of disability  in-\n          surance because of some prior condition  that\n          might eventually  disable him.  On  the other\n          hand,  the insurer is protected in that it is\n          not precluded from denying benefits to an ap-\n          plicant  whose pre-existing  condition is  so\n          bad that he becomes disabled during  the two-\n          year period.\n\nWischmeyer, 725 F. Supp. at 1001-02.\n          \n\n     Under the \"notification\"  theory adopted  below, however,  a\ndishonest insured  could frustrate  this legislative intent  com-\npletely, simply by  waiting out the contestability  period before\nsubmitting a claim.   Thus, in our view  the parenthetical clause\n\n                                9\n\n2.   The Date of Disability.\n                           \n\n          As  an alternate basis  for summary judgment,  the dis-\n\ntrict court specifically found that V lez did not become disabled\n                                                                 \n\nuntil March 1,  1989, more  than two years  after the  policy was\n\nissued on November 24, 1986.  Thus, even under our reading of the\n\nincontestability clause, SMA  would be barred from  asserting the\n\npresent challenge.\n\n          The district  court based  its disability-date  finding\n\nexclusively on a letter from IBM, stating that V lez was employed\n\nfrom August 9, 1971 until March 1, 1989, when he went on \"medical\n\ndisability.\"5   The  IBM  letter did  not  stand alone,  however.\n\nV lez's  claim for  disability  benefits  under  the  SMA  policy\n\nincluded a statement from his own physician indicating that V lez\n\nbecame \"totally  disabled (unable to  work)\" in October  of 1988,\n\nwithin two calendar  years after the policy issued.   The summary\n\njudgment record  further reveals  that V lez  filed a  disability\n\nclaim with the Social Security Administration on June 5, 1989, in\n\nwhich he  represented (in  the  words of  the administrative  law\n\njudge) that  \"he became  disabled as of  November 2, 1987  due to\n\nMultiple Sclerosis.\"   Given  this evidence,  and the  reasonable\n\ninferences  therefrom, Goldman,  985 F.2d  at  1116, the  factual\n                              \n\n                    \n\nclearly reflects  the legislature's rejection  of the  \"notifica-\ntion\" theory,  based on  policy grounds well within its exclusive\ndomain.  Id. at 1004.\n            \n\n     5The  IBM letter states:   \"This will serve as certification\nthat Mr.  Julio Velez was  employed by [IBM] from  August 9, 1971\nuntil he went on Medical Disability on March 1, 1989.\"\n\n                                10\n\ndispute  over the  onset  of V lez's  disability  simply was  not\n\namenable to summary disposition.\n\n3.   The Duty to Investigate.\n                            \n\n          As  its third ground for summary judgment, the district\n\ncourt held  SMA estopped from  contesting the policy  because (1)\n\nOrtiz  knew of  V lez's  multiple  sclerosis  before  the  policy\n\nissued;  (2)  Ortiz was  SMA's  agent; (3)  Ortiz's  knowledge is\n\nimputable to SMA; (4) V lez's health problems would have prompted\n\na reasonably  prudent insurer to  investigate V lez's preexisting\n\ncondition; and (5) SMA failed to  investigate during the contest-\n\nability period.   Even assuming that the many  subsidiary factual\n\nand legal elements in its conclusion were properly resolved under\n\nour summary judgment jurisprudence,  the district court's conclu-\n\nsion cannot  stand.  Its thesis that SMA  failed to meet its duty\n\nto  investigate \"during the  contestability period\"  collapses in\n                                                  \n\nview of  our determination, see  supra at pp. 6-8,  that the two-\n                                      \n\nyear  contestability  period was  tolled  by V lez's  intervening\n\ndisability.\n\n          Further,  the  district  court ruling  falters  on  its\n\nimpermissible  factual premise that SMA was on notice of \"certain\n\nmedical conditions\" which  would have prompted a  prudent insurer\n\nto investigate.    Our summary  judgment jurisprudence  precludes\n\njudicial resolution of genuine issues of material fact.  Goldman,\n                                                                \n\n985 F.2d at 1116.  No doubt what Ortiz knew about V lez's medical\n\ncondition, see supra at pp. 2-3, may be hotly contested at trial.\n                    \n\nAt the  summary judgment  stage, however, there  is \"no  room for\n\n                                11\n\ncredibility  determinations, no room for the measured weighing of\n\nconflicting  evidence such as the trial  process entails, no room\n\nfor the  judge to  superimpose his own  ideas of  probability and\n\nlikelihood (no matter how reasonable those ideas may be) . . . .\"\n\nGreenburg v.  Puerto Rico  Maritime Shipping Auth., 835 F.2d 932,\n                                                  \n\n936  (1st Cir. 1987). Drawing all reasonable inferences favorable\n\nto  SMA,  as  we must,  see  Goldman,  985 F.2d  at  1116,  it is\n                                    \n\ninconceivable  to  us  that V lez's  wife's  dinner-party comment\n\nabout  her husband's  \"achaques\" (\"aches  and pains\")  reasonably\n                               \n\ncould be considered  conclusive evidence sufficient to  require a\n\nprudent insurer to act on  any general duty to investigate during\n\nthe contestability period.6\n\n          Given the plain language in the incontestability clause\n\nand the  inconclusive state of  the summary judgment  record, the\n\nlegal and factual grounds for holding that SMA violated a duty to\n\ninvestigate during the contestability period were untenable. \n\n                    \n\n     6The two cases the district  court relied on for its holding\nthat  insurers have  a general \"duty  to investigate\"  during the\ncontestability period, Rodriguez  v. John Hancock, 110  D.P.R. 1,\n                                                 \n10 Official Translations 913 (1980),  and Heirs of Roche v.

Both involved attempts to contest policies after\nthe expiration of the contestability period.  Neither case stands\nfor the proposition that insurers have a general duty to investi-\ngate, nor  that a failure  to investigate might estop  an insurer\nfrom challenging a policy, during the contestability period.\n                                                           \n\n                                12\n\n                               III\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n                                      \n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district\n\ncourt must be vacated  and the case must be remanded  for further\n\nproceedings.\n\n          The  district court judgment is vacated and the case is\n                                                                 \n\nremandedfor further proceedings consistent herewith.

O'Connor v. Steeves, 994 F.2d 905, 907 (1st Cir.1993).   Velez was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis around 1983.   Sometime in 1986, Velez and his wife attended a dinner party at the home of their neighbor, Isidro Ortiz Pepin.   Amongst a group of people at the party, Velez's wife made comments about her husband's health.   There is no evidence that Ortiz overheard or participated in the conversation, nor that Ortiz was aware Velez had multiple sclerosis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly thereafter, Ortiz, who was neither an SMA employee nor authorized to sell its insurance, arranged for Velez to meet with Luis R. Montes, an SMA agent.   There was no discussion of Velez's condition at their meeting and Montes was not made aware of Velez's \"achaques\" or the multiple sclerosis diagnosis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Velez represented on the SMA insurance application that he had not been diagnosed with, or received treatment for, any nerve disorder (viz., multiple sclerosis) during the preceding ten years.   On November 24, 1986, SMA issued a disability-income insurance policy designating Velez, as the insured.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June of 1989, Velez, claiming total disability, applied for benefits under the SMA policy.   Based on the alleged material misstatement by Velez in the insurance application, SMA refused to pay on the policy and refunded all premiums, with interest.   Whereupon, Velez brought the present action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following discovery, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.   Velez contended that the two-year bar period for contesting the policy had expired, and, further, that SMA was estopped from contesting the policy based on Velez's preexisting medical condition because Ortiz, allegedly SMA's agent, had known at the time the policy was issued that Velez was suffering from multiple sclerosis.   According to SMA, on the other hand, the incontestability clause tolled the two-year period while Velez was disabled, Velez became disabled less than two years after the policy went into effect and, therefore, SMA was still entitled to contest the policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found for Velez on the incontestability clause issue and two other liability theories.

Goldman v. First Nat'l Bank, 985 F.2d 1113, 1116 (1st Cir.1993).   Summary judgment is appropriate where the record, viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, reveals no trialworthy issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

The SMA incontestability clause, a simplified version of the model contained in the Puerto Rico Insurance Code, see P.R.Laws Ann. tit. 26, &#167; 1606 (1977), provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>(a) After this policy has been in force for two years during your lifetime (excluding any period during which you are disabled ), [SMA] will not be able to contest the statements made in the application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis added.)

On appeal, SMA contends that the district court improvised ambiguity where there was none.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The insurance policy is to be interpreted in accordance with Puerto Rico law recently surveyed by this court:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Puerto Rico law, the Insurance Code of Puerto Rico, 26 L.P.R.A. &#167;&#167; 101, et seq., controls the interpretation of insurance contracts.   Roberto Melendez Pinero v. Levitt &amp; Sons of Puerto Rico, Inc., 91 J.T.S. 95, 9052 (December 13, 1991).   Article 11.250 of the Insurance Code of Puerto Rico provides that every insurance contract \"shall be construed according to the entirety of its terms and conditions as set forth in the policy, and as amplified, extended, or modified by any lawful rider, endorsement, or application attached and made a part of the policy.\"  26 L.P.R.A. &#167; 1125.   See also Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority v. Philipps, 645 F.Supp. 770, 772 (D.P.R.1986).   When the Insurance Code of Puerto Rico does not provide an interpretive approach for a particular situation, the Civil Code is used as a supplemental source of law in interpreting the insurance contract.   Puerto Rico Housing Bank v. Pagan Insurance Underwriters, 11 Official Translations 3, 8 (1981);  111 D.P.R. 1, 6;  Gonzalez v. John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., 927 F.2d 659, 669 (1st Cir.1991).   Article 1233 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code provides that when \"the terms of a contract are clear and leave no doubt as to the intentions of the contracting parties, the literal sense of its stipulations shall be observed.\"  31 L.P.R.A. &#167; 3471.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nieves v. Intercontinental Life Ins. Co., 964 F.2d 60, 63 (1st Cir.1992).   As a general matter, ordinary rules of construction apply to incontestability clauses.   1A J. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice, &#167; 311 at 313 (1981) (hereinafter Appleman);  18 G. Couch, Couch on Insurance 2d &#167; 72:9 (rev. ed. 1983) (hereinafter Couch).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first interpretive waymark, of course, is the language of the parenthetical tolling provision itself:  \"excluding any period during which you are disabled,\" where we find no ambiguity whatever.   Rather, the parenthetical straightforwardly tolls the running of the two-year period for the duration of any disability commencing within it.   When \"the wording of the contract is explicit and its language is clear, its terms and conditions are binding on the parties.\"  Nieves, 964 F.2d at 63 (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Related provisions within the four corners of the policy likewise counsel a common-sense reading of the plain language of the tolling provision.   First, the term \"disability\" is defined in the policy as \"injury or sickness [that] makes you unable to engage in your regular occupation.\"   Thus, the date of disability is the relevant tolling event.   There is nothing to suggest that post-disability notification of the insurer is germane to the tolling inquiry.   Second, our interpretation of the parenthetical in paragraph (a) comports precisely with the language in companion paragraph (b):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>(b) [SMA] will not be able to reduce or deny any claim for disability which starts after two years from the date of issue because the disease or physical condition existed before the date of issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis added.)   The hand-and-glove fit between these coordinate provisions is completely undone by Velez's interpretation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parenthetical is adapted from a standardized incontestability clause mandated by statute in at least forty-five states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, in addition to Puerto Rico.   We consider it significant that every other court that has considered the matter to date has arrived at the interpretation urged by SMA, and no court has suggested a notification requirement.   See, e.g., Wischmeyer v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., 725 F.Supp. 995, 998 (S.D.Ind.1989) (\"This clause of the contract is plain and unambiguous.\")  (emphasis added);  Bronson v. Washington Nat'l Ins. Co., 59 Ill.App.2d 253, 207 N.E.2d 172, 176 (1965) (Holding contestability period tolled at onset of insured's disability);  Taylor v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 106 N.H. 455, 214 A.2d 109, 114-15 (1965) (same);  Standard Security  Life Ins. Co. v. Klamer, 27 A.D.2d 656, 276 N.Y.S.2d 645, 646 (1967) (same);  Union Mut. Life Ins. Co. v.

In mandating a contractual period of repose on insurer challenges to disability-income insurance policies predicated on alleged misrepresentations in the insurance application, legislatures accommodate the interests of both insurers and insureds, based on two competing policies:  promoting insurance security and deterring insurance fraud.   See Appleman, &#167; 311 at 305-306;  see also Couch, &#167; 72:16.   Thus, after the contestability period has run, the insurer cannot withdraw insurance protection even though the insurance application contained misstatements.   On the other hand, to better forfend against the occasional insured who would perpetrate fraud at the expense of insurers and their fellow insurance consumers, the contractual limitations period is tolled for the duration of any disability arising within the relatively brief contestability period following issuance of the policy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>2.

Thus, even under our reading of the incontestability clause, SMA would be barred from asserting the present challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court based its disability-date finding exclusively on a letter from IBM, stating that Velez was employed from August 9, 1971 until March 1, 1989, when he went on \"medical disability.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The IBM letter did not stand alone, however.   Velez's claim for disability benefits under the SMA policy included a statement from his own physician indicating that Velez became \"totally disabled (unable to work)\" in October of 1988, within two calendar years after the policy issued.   The summary judgment record further reveals that Velez filed a disability claim with the Social Security Administration on June 5, 1989, in which he represented (in the words of the administrative law judge) that \"he became disabled as of November 2, 1987 due to Multiple Sclerosis.\"   Given this evidence, and the reasonable inferences therefrom, Goldman, 985 F.2d at 1116, the factual dispute over the onset of Velez's disability simply was not amenable to summary disposition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>3. The Duty to Investigate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As its third ground for summary judgment, the district court held SMA estopped from contesting the policy because (1) Ortiz knew of Velez's multiple sclerosis before the policy issued;  (2) Ortiz was SMA's agent;  (3) Ortiz's knowledge is imputable to SMA;  (4) Velez's health problems would have prompted a reasonably prudent insurer to investigate Velez's preexisting condition;  and (5) SMA failed to investigate during the contestability period.   Even assuming that the many subsidiary factual and legal elements in its conclusion were properly resolved under our summary judgment jurisprudence, the district court's conclusion cannot stand.   Its thesis that SMA failed to meet its duty to investigate \"during the contestability period\" collapses in view of our determination, see supra at pp. 875-76, that the two-year contestability period was tolled by Velez's intervening disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the district court ruling falters on its impermissible factual premise that SMA was on notice of \"certain medical conditions\" which would have prompted a prudent insurer to investigate.   Our summary judgment jurisprudence precludes judicial resolution of genuine issues of material fact.  Goldman, 985 F.2d at 1116.   No doubt what Ortiz knew about Velez's medical condition, see supra at p. 874, may be hotly contested at trial.   At the summary judgment stage, however, there is \"no room for credibility determinations, no room for the measured weighing of conflicting evidence such as the trial process entails, no room for the judge to superimpose his own ideas of probability and likelihood (no matter how reasonable those ideas may be)....\"  Greenburg v. Puerto Rico Maritime Shipping Auth., 835 F.2d 932, 936 (1st Cir.1987).   Drawing all reasonable inferences favorable to SMA, as we must, see Goldman, 985 F.2d at 1116, it is inconceivable to us that Velez's wife's dinner-party comment about her husband's \"achaques\" (\"aches and pains\") reasonably could be considered conclusive evidence sufficient to require a prudent insurer to act on any general duty to investigate during the contestability period.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the plain language in the incontestability clause and the inconclusive state of the summary judgment record, the legal and factual grounds for holding that SMA violated a duty to investigate during the contestability period were untenable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court must be vacated and the case must be remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court judgment is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent herewith.

Velez was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis around 1983.   Sometime in 1986, Velez and his wife attended a dinner party at the home of their neighbor, Isidro Ortiz Pepin.   Amongst a group of people at the party, Velez's wife made comments about her husband's health.   There is no evidence that Ortiz overheard or participated in the conversation, nor that Ortiz was aware Velez had multiple sclerosis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly thereafter, Ortiz, who was neither an SMA employee nor authorized to sell its insurance, arranged for Velez to meet with Luis R. Montes, an SMA agent.   There was no discussion of Velez's condition at their meeting and Montes was not made aware of Velez's \"achaques\" or the multiple sclerosis diagnosis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Velez represented on the SMA insurance application that he had not been diagnosed with, or received treatment for, any nerve disorder (viz., multiple sclerosis) during the preceding ten years.   On November 24, 1986, SMA issued a disability-income insurance policy designating Velez, as the insured.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June of 1989, Velez, claiming total disability, applied for benefits under the SMA policy.   Based on the alleged material misstatement by Velez in the insurance application, SMA refused to pay on the policy and refunded all premiums, with interest.

Velez contended that the two-year bar period for contesting the policy had expired, and, further, that SMA was estopped from contesting the policy based on Velez's preexisting medical condition because Ortiz, allegedly SMA's agent, had known at the time the policy was issued that Velez was suffering from multiple sclerosis.   According to SMA, on the other hand, the incontestability clause tolled the two-year period while Velez was disabled, Velez became disabled less than two years after the policy went into effect and, therefore, SMA was still entitled to contest the policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found for Velez on the incontestability clause issue and two other liability theories.

Rather, the parenthetical straightforwardly tolls the running of the two-year period for the duration of any disability commencing within it.   When \"the wording of the contract is explicit and its language is clear, its terms and conditions are binding on the parties.\"  Nieves, 964 F.2d at 63 (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Related provisions within the four corners of the policy likewise counsel a common-sense reading of the plain language of the tolling provision.   First, the term \"disability\" is defined in the policy as \"injury or sickness [that] makes you unable to engage in your regular occupation.\"   Thus, the date of disability is the relevant tolling event.   There is nothing to suggest that post-disability notification of the insurer is germane to the tolling inquiry.   Second, our interpretation of the parenthetical in paragraph (a) comports precisely with the language in companion paragraph (b):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>(b) [SMA] will not be able to reduce or deny any claim for disability which starts after two years from the date of issue because the disease or physical condition existed before the date of issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis added.)

In mandating a contractual period of repose on insurer challenges to disability-income insurance policies predicated on alleged misrepresentations in the insurance application, legislatures accommodate the interests of both insurers and insureds, based on two competing policies:  promoting insurance security and deterring insurance fraud.   See Appleman, &#167; 311 at 305-306;  see also Couch, &#167; 72:16.   Thus, after the contestability period has run, the insurer cannot withdraw insurance protection even though the insurance application contained misstatements.   On the other hand, to better forfend against the occasional insured who would perpetrate fraud at the expense of insurers and their fellow insurance consumers, the contractual limitations period is tolled for the duration of any disability arising within the relatively brief contestability period following issuance of the policy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>2.

Velez's claim for disability benefits under the SMA policy included a statement from his own physician indicating that Velez became \"totally disabled (unable to work)\" in October of 1988, within two calendar years after the policy issued.   The summary judgment record further reveals that Velez filed a disability claim with the Social Security Administration on June 5, 1989, in which he represented (in the words of the administrative law judge) that \"he became disabled as of November 2, 1987 due to Multiple Sclerosis.\"   Given this evidence, and the reasonable inferences therefrom, Goldman, 985 F.2d at 1116, the factual dispute over the onset of Velez's disability simply was not amenable to summary disposition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>3. The Duty to Investigate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As its third ground for summary judgment, the district court held SMA estopped from contesting the policy because (1) Ortiz knew of Velez's multiple sclerosis before the policy issued;  (2) Ortiz was SMA's agent;  (3) Ortiz's knowledge is imputable to SMA;  (4) Velez's health problems would have prompted a reasonably prudent insurer to investigate Velez's preexisting condition;  and (5) SMA failed to investigate during the contestability period.   Even assuming that the many subsidiary factual and legal elements in its conclusion were properly resolved under our summary judgment jurisprudence, the district court's conclusion cannot stand.   Its thesis that SMA failed to meet its duty to investigate \"during the contestability period\" collapses in view of our determination, see supra at pp. 875-76, that the two-year contestability period was tolled by Velez's intervening disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the district court ruling falters on its impermissible factual premise that SMA was on notice of \"certain medical conditions\" which would have prompted a prudent insurer to investigate.   Our summary judgment jurisprudence precludes judicial resolution of genuine issues of material fact.  Goldman, 985 F.2d at 1116.   No doubt what Ortiz knew about Velez's medical condition, see supra at p. 874, may be hotly contested at trial.   At the summary judgment stage, however, there is \"no room for credibility determinations, no room for the measured weighing of conflicting evidence such as the trial process entails, no room for the judge to superimpose his own ideas of probability and likelihood (no matter how reasonable those ideas may be)....\"  Greenburg v.

Drawing all reasonable inferences favorable to SMA, as we must, see Goldman, 985 F.2d at 1116, it is inconceivable to us that Velez's wife's dinner-party comment about her husband's \"achaques\" (\"aches and pains\") reasonably could be considered conclusive evidence sufficient to require a prudent insurer to act on any general duty to investigate during the contestability period.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the plain language in the incontestability clause and the inconclusive state of the summary judgment record, the legal and factual grounds for holding that SMA violated a duty to investigate during the contestability period were untenable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court must be vacated and the case must be remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court judgment is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent herewith.

Deviations from the Insurance Code model (e.g., SMA's use of a two-year, rather than a three-year, contestability period) are permitted provided they benefit the insured.

On the other hand, the insurer is protected in that it is not precluded from denying benefits to an applicant whose pre-existing condition is so bad that he becomes disabled during the two-year period.</p>\n        <p>Wischmeyer, 725 F.Supp. at 1001-02.</p>\n        <p>Under the \"notification\" theory adopted below, however, a dishonest insured could frustrate this legislative intent completely, simply by waiting out the contestability period before submitting a claim.   Thus, in our view the parenthetical clause clearly reflects the legislature's rejection of the \"notification\" theory, based on policy grounds well within its exclusive domain.  Id. at 1004.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The IBM letter states:  \"This will serve as certification that Mr. Julio Velez was employed by [IBM] from August 9, 1971 until he went on Medical Disability on March 1, 1989.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The two cases the district court relied on for its holding that insurers have a general \"duty to investigate\" during the contestability period, Rodriguez v.

Both involved attempts to contest policies after the expiration of the contestability period.   Neither case stands for the proposition that insurers have a general duty to investigate, nor that a failure to investigate might estop an insurer from challenging a policy, during the contestability period</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
