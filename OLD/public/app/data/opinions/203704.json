SABOL, WARDEN OF FMC DEVENS,\n\n                        Respondent, Appellee.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n              [Hon. Nancy Gertner, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                          Lynch, Chief Judge,\n                  Boudin and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Timothy G. Watkins, Federal Defender Office, for appellant.\n     Anton P. Giedt, Assistant U.S. Attorney, with whom Michael\nJ. Sullivan, U.S. Attorney, was on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          February 27, 2009\n\f            LYNCH, Chief Judge.   The primary issue raised on this\n\nfederal habeas appeal is whether an escaped prisoner can shorten\n\nhis term of actual incarceration under the common law doctrine of\n\ncredit for time erroneously at liberty because, after he was picked\n\nup, he was inadvertently released and remained at liberty for a\n\nperiod of fourteen months before he was eventually arrested again.\n\nThe district court answered this question \"No,\" Espinoza v. Sabol,\n\nNo. 06-cv-11974-NG (D. Mass. Apr. 30, 2008), and so do we.\n\n                                  I.\n\n            In 1987, Gilbert Espinoza was sentenced to a term of 84\n\nmonths' imprisonment for two federal drug convictions.     The U.S.\n\nParole Commission set a presumptive parole date of January 9, 1994\n\nfor Espinoza.    He never met that date while in custody and so was\n\nnot on parole.    Instead, about two weeks before his presumptive\n\nparole date, he escaped.   On December 26, 1993, he walked away from\n\nthe New Mexico halfway house in which he had been serving his\n\nsentence.   At that point, more than two years of the 84-month term\n\nremained to be served.\n\n            The Bureau of Prisons (\"BOP\") on January 6, 1994 found\n\nhim guilty of escape and subsequently made a recommendation to the\n\nParole Commission that his presumptive parole date be rescinded,\n\nafter a disciplinary hearing which Espinoza did not attend.      On\n\nJanuary 31, 1994, the Commission reopened and \"retarded\" his\n\npresumptive parole date and scheduled a rescission hearing to take\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fplace upon Espinoza's return to a federal institution.      See 28\n\nC.F.R. ยง 2.34(a) (1993).   \"Retard\" is a term of art in the parole\n\ncontext and means to postpone a presumptive parole date.   See King\n\nv. Simpson, 189 F.3d 284, 288 (2d Cir. 1999).    A criminal escape\n\ncharge under 18 U.S.C. ยง 751(a) was also filed against Espinoza in\n\nfederal court.\n\n          Espinoza remained at liberty until June 5, 1995, when\n\nstate authorities in New Mexico arrested him for shoplifting.1\n\nThey transferred him to the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service.\n\nFederal prosecutors declined to pursue the criminal escape charge.\n\nThe U.S. Marshals Service, rather than returning Espinoza to prison\n\nto serve the remainder of his sentence for the 1987 drug crimes,\n\nmistakenly released him from custody on June 7, 1995. Although the\n\nrecord is not clear, the Marshals seem to have booked Espinoza\n\nincorrectly -- Espinoza, whose full name is Gilbert Espinoza-Saenz,\n\nwas apparently misidentified as Gilbert Espinoza-Sanchez, a man of\n\napproximately the same age with a social security number similar to\n\nEspinoza's and who was not subject to a prison sentence at the\n\ntime.\n\n          Fourteen months later, on August 6, 1996, Espinoza was\n\narrested again, this time on new federal drug charges.   In federal\n\ncourt in New Mexico, he pled guilty and was sentenced to a term of\n\n\n\n     1\n          Espinoza concedes that he cannot obtain sentence credit\nfor the period between December 26, 1993 and June 5, 1995.\n\n                                -3-\n\f151 months' imprisonment on March 10, 1997.               The sentencing court\n\nwas aware of Espinoza's prior sentence -- Espinoza's pre-sentence\n\nreport noted that he had time remaining on his 1987 sentence and\n\nthat he had committed his new offense after escaping.                 The court\n\nwas not explicit as to whether Espinoza's new sentence should run\n\nconcurrently with his 1987 sentence or whether they should run\n\nconsecutively.\n\n             Upon Espinoza's return to custody and after a hearing on\n\nAugust 14, 1997, the BOP found him guilty of escape.                 The Parole\n\nCommission rescinded Espinoza's presumptive parole date on April\n\n21, 1998 on the basis of this finding, as well as based on his new\n\nconviction.         The   BOP    then     calculated    Espinoza's   period   of\n\nincarceration, concluding that he had to serve the remainder of his\n\n1987 sentence with credit for periods that he spent in custody,\n\nincluding the period of June 5-7, 1995.                 Because the New Mexico\n\nfederal district court had been silent as to whether Espinoza's new\n\nsentence would be served concurrently or consecutively with the\n\n1987 sentence, the BOP decided the question and concluded that the\n\nsentences were consecutive.             The result was that Espinoza served\n\nthe remainder of his 1987 sentence from August 6, 1996 to January\n\n10,   1999    and    began      serving    his   1997    sentence    immediately\n\nthereafter.\n\n             Espinoza filed a pro se petition for habeas relief under\n\n28 U.S.C. ยง 2241 in Massachusetts federal court, alleging that the\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fBOP had erred in calculating his period of incarceration and was\n\nrequiring him to serve time on the dismissed escape charge.               The\n\ncourt   appointed   counsel,    who    reframed   the    issues.     In    a\n\nsupplemental pleading, Espinoza argued that he was entitled to\n\ncredit against his sentence for the time he spent at liberty\n\nbetween June 7, 1995 and August 6, 1996 and that the BOP had erred\n\nin determining that his two sentences were to run consecutively.\n\n          On   April   30,   2008,    the   district   court   granted    the\n\ngovernment's motion to dismiss, holding that the June 5-7, 1995\n\ndetention did not recommence his sentence and thus did not trigger\n\nthe time at liberty doctrine and that the BOP had correctly\n\ndetermined that Espinoza's sentences were to run consecutively.\n\nThe court concluded that the Parole Commission had erred in not\n\nholding a rescission hearing within 90 days of Espinoza's return to\n\nfederal custody, see 28 C.F.R. ยง 2.34(a), but that this error did\n\nnot entitle Espinoza to additional sentence credit.\n\n                                     II.\n\nA.        The Doctrine of Credit for Time Erroneously at Liberty\n\n          Espinoza argues he should be given credit against his\n\nsentence for the time he spent erroneously at liberty.          Espinoza's\n\nargument is that because the U.S. Marshals Service erred (by\n\nconfusing him with a similarly named person with a like social\n\nsecurity number) in releasing him on June 7, 1995, he should be\n\ngiven credit through August 6, 1996, the date of his next arrest,\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\ftoward his sentence.   He says it was not his fault he was released\n\non June 7, 1995, but the government's, and so his final release\n\ndate should have been October 28, 2008 and not December 26, 2009.\n\n          The length of the term of actual imprisonment to be\n\nserved following a criminal conviction and sentence is subject to\n\nvarious constitutional and other legal restraints, both as to\n\nincreases and as to decreases of the time in confinement.        For\n\nexample, an increase in sentence after a defendant has begun to\n\nserve his sentence may contravene the constitutional prohibition\n\nagainst double jeopardy.    Breest v. Helgemoe, 579 F.2d 95, 99 (1st\n\nCir. 1978).   However, if the original sentence was erroneous, the\n\nConstitution contains no general rule prohibiting a court from\n\nfinding that sentence erroneous and holding that a sentence of\n\ngreater length was required by law.     DeWitt v. Ventetoulo, 6 F.3d\n\n32, 34 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n          As to a claimed decrease in time of incarceration,\n\nsubstantive due process may prohibit the continued incarceration of\n\na prisoner under certain facts.    The substantive component of the\n\nDue Process Clause is violated by executive action \"when it 'can\n\nproperly be characterized as arbitrary, or conscience shocking, in\n\na constitutional sense.'\"   County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S.\n\n833, 847 & n.8 (1998) (quoting Collins v. City of Harker Heights,\n\n\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\f503 U.S. 115, 128 (1992));2 see also United States v. Acosta-\n\nMartinez, 252 F.3d 13, 21 (1st Cir. 2001) (\"When testing executive\n\naction, the Supreme Court has used the 'shocking to the conscience'\n\ntest.\"); DeWitt, 6 F.3d at 35.               Most cases in which a prisoner\n\nseeks       credit   for   his   time   at   liberty   involve   some   form    of\n\nconstitutional due process claim.3             While we have not explicitly\n\naddressed such a claim, we have recognized that in the \"extreme\n\ncase\" -- based on a number of factors -- sentence revision may\n\n\"cross[] the line\" and violate due process; and our rationale could\n\nconceivably apply to a time at liberty constitutional claim.                   See\n\nDeWitt, 6 F.3d at 34-36.            But this is not an extreme case, and\n\n\n     2\n            \"[The] criteria to identify what is fatally arbitrary\n[under the Due Process Clause] differ depending on whether it is\nlegislation or a specific act of a governmental officer that is at\nissue.\" Lewis, 523 U.S. at 846. The alternate formulation of the\ntest usually applied to legislative action is whether the conduct\nviolates a fundamental right or liberty implicit in the prisoner's\ndue process rights. Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 719-21\n(1997). No court has held that a prisoner has a fundamental right\nto remain free after he has been released erroneously, and some\nhave flatly rejected the claim. See, e.g., Hawkins v. Freeman, 195\nF.3d 732, 747 (4th Cir. 1999) (en banc).\n        3\n          Some circuits have addressed a due process theory that a\nstate waives its jurisdiction when it delays executing a sentence.\nBonebrake v. Norris, 417 F.3d 938, 941-44 (8th Cir. 2005)\n(rejecting claim based on four years' delay by a state in\nimprisoning petitioner).   Others have used the theory that the\ngovernment is constitutionally estopped from reincarcerating the\npetitioner. Green v. Christiansen, 732 F.2d 1397, 1399 (9th Cir.\n1984). The Ninth Circuit has treated similar arguments in a case\ninvolving erroneous release on parole under a non-constitutional\nequitable estoppel theory. Johnson v. Williford, 682 F.2d 868 (9th\nCir. 1982).   Other courts have approached similar questions as\nconstitutional ones of implied pardon or commutation. See, e.g.,\nShields v. Beto, 370 F.2d 1003 (5th Cir. 1967).\n\n                                         -7-\n\fappropriately Espinoza does not make any claims to release based on\n\na constitutional provision.       We will assume, in Espinoza's favor,\n\nthat he may seek relief even when no due process claim is stated.\n\n          In the federal criminal justice system, mechanisms for\n\ngranting credits that can be used to adjust time served have been\n\nlargely set by legislation.        For example, 18 U.S.C. ยง 3585(b)\n\nspecifies that a defendant convicted of a federal crime has a right\n\nto receive credit for certain time spent in official detention\n\nbefore his sentence begins.        That credit is determined by the\n\nAttorney General, not by a court.     See United States v. Wilson, 503\n\nU.S. 329, 334-35 (1992).     In the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984,\n\nCongress, with few exceptions, abolished parole, which eliminated\n\none mechanism for allowing prisoners credit to reduce their time\n\nserved.   Prisoners   may   now    receive   credit   only   in   carefully\n\ncircumscribed situations, such as for their good behavior while\n\nincarcerated.4   See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. ยง 3624(b) (allowing grant of\n\ncredit toward the service of a sentence for satisfactory behavior).\n\nThe relationship between the release date and credits to be given\n\nfor satisfactory behavior is set forth in 18 U.S.C. ยง 3624.            See\n\nPerez-Olivo v. Chavez, 394 F.3d 45, 47 & n.1 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nAlthough Congress could have codified some program of credit for\n\n\n\n     4\n          Further, Fed. R. Crim. P. 35 permits a judge, on motion\nof the prosecution, to reduce a sentence for specified reasons,\nsuch as post-conviction cooperation and substantial assistance to\nthe prosecution.\n\n                                    -8-\n\fpersons erroneously released, it has not done so. Espinoza's claim\n\nto early release is not based on any statute.\n\n            Congress's strong interest in federal sentences raises\n\nother considerations, which interact with the claim Espinoza makes.\n\nEspinoza's argument raises a concern about the allocation of power\n\nover the length of actual imprisonment between the federal judicial\n\nbranch and the executive branch.      See Wilson, 503 U.S. at 335-36.\n\nBy definition, arguments such as Espinoza's are presented to courts\n\nwhen the executive branch officials, exercising whatever discretion\n\nhas been allotted to them, have decided not to give the prisoner\n\nthe credits he seeks.\n\n            Second, concerns may be raised about whether the asserted\n\nfederal common law doctrine alone survives the Sentencing Reform\n\nAct of 1984.    See G.J. Chin, Getting Out of Jail Free: Sentence\n\nCredits for Periods of Mistaken Liberty, 45 Cath. U. L. Rev. 403,\n\n404 (1996).    The answer to that question is neither briefed to us\n\nnor necessary to our conclusion.         Application of the common law\n\ndoctrine, however, may not be divorced from the overall purposes\n\nfor sentencing set by Congress in the 1984 Sentencing Reform Act.\n\nThese purposes include the need for \"uniformity, honesty, and\n\nproportionality.\"    United States v. O'Neil, 11 F.3d 292, 297 n.4\n\n(1st Cir. 1993); see also S. Rep. No. 98-225, at 50-60, reprinted\n\nin   1984   U.S.C.C.A.N.   3182,   3233-43   (listing   statutory   goals\n\n\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fincluding    comprehensiveness    and    consistency,   elimination   of\n\nsentencing disparity, and certainty in release dates).\n\n            Espinoza's claim is based entirely on the common law\n\n\"time at liberty\" doctrine.5     We will assume the federal common law\n\ndoctrine still has vitality, despite its lack of legislative\n\nrecognition. The federal doctrine was apparently first articulated\n\nin 1930 in White v. Pearlman, 42 F.2d 788 (10th Cir. 1930).       Judge\n\nPosner, in Dunne v. Keohane, 14 F.3d 335 (7th Cir. 1994), set forth\n\na core purpose of the doctrine:\n\n            The government is not permitted to play cat\n            and   mouse   with the   prisoner,   delaying\n            indefinitely the expiation of his debt to\n            society and his reintegration into the free\n            community. Punishment on the installment plan\n            is forbidden.\n\nId. at 336.      In this view, the doctrine is \"only a rule of\n\ninterpretation, . . . an attempt laden with considerations of\n\npolicy, to divine the will of the legislature.\"         Id. at 337; see\n\nalso Boston v. Att'y Gen., 210 F. App'x 190, 193 & n.2 (3d Cir.\n\n2006) (per curiam) (\"[W]here the danger animating the rule is not\n\npresent, the common law rule need not be inflexibly applied.\"). We\n\nagree that the doctrine is not a general criminal equity doctrine,\n\nto be exercised at the discretion of federal courts.\n\n\n\n     5\n          This court has never published an opinion on the\ndoctrine. Some form of the issue was raised in one case, which was\nsettled by an agreement that the defendant would receive credit\nagainst his sentence for more than 13 months. See United States v.\nNickens, No. 94-1861, 1995 WL 314483 (1st Cir. April 14, 1995).\n\n                                  -10-\n\f            The situations the doctrine was designed to encompass\n\nhave been variously explained. Some courts, most notably the Fifth\n\nand Seventh Circuits, have indicated that it should be applied only\n\nwhere \"the government is trying to delay the expiration of the\n\ndefendant's sentence.\"       Dunne, 14 F.3d at 337; see Bintzler v.\n\nGonzales, 239 F. App'x 271, 275 (7th Cir. 2007) (finding the\n\ndoctrine \"of dubious application where the government has not\n\nintentionally sought to delay . . . imprisonment\") (emphasis\n\nadded); Free v. Miles, 333 F.3d 550, 554 (5th Cir. 2003) (stressing\n\nthat the doctrine's \"sole purpose is to prevent the government from\n\nabusing its coercive power to imprison a person by artificially\n\nextending   the   duration   of   his   sentence   through   releases   and\n\nreincarcerations\").\n\n            Other courts have focused instead on the right of the\n\nprisoner \"to re-establish himself and live down his past\" and have\n\ntherefore applied the doctrine where a prisoner is discharged\n\nwithout fault regardless whether the government's discharge was\n\nintentional or negligent.     White, 42 F.2d at 789; see also United\n\nStates v. Greenhaus, 89 F.2d 634, 635 (2d Cir. 1937) (per curiam).\n\nThe most recent court to adopt and expand upon the latter view is\n\nthe Third Circuit.    Vega v. United States, 493 F.3d 310, 319 (3d\n\nCir. 2007) (adopting a burden-shifting framework whereby, once the\n\nprisoner shows he has been released with unserved time remaining on\n\nhis sentence, \"the burden shifts to the government to prove either\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\f(1) that there was no negligence on the part of the imprisoning\n\nsovereign, or (2) that the prisoner obtained or retained his\n\nliberty through his own efforts\").6\n\n              Espinoza    urges   adoption        of   the    Vega   burden-shifting\n\nframework, claiming he is entitled to a presumption of credit based\n\non his showing that he was released despite having time remaining\n\non his sentence; therefore, the burden shifts to the government to\n\nnegate negligence or show he was at fault.                        We need not decide\n\nwhether negligence might, in certain situations and in combination\n\nwith other factors, suffice to trigger the doctrine.                       However, our\n\nview is quite different than the Third Circuit's, both as to the\n\nallocation     of   burdens     and     as   to    the   role      given    negligence\n\nsimpliciter.\n\n              In our view, the burden of proof under ยง 2241 is on the\n\nprisoner Espinoza, as it is on other prisoners in ยง 2241 cases.\n\nEspinoza's claim is that he has a right to be released upon the\n\ngrounds that the sentence was imposed in violation of law.                            The\n\nburden   of    proof     of   showing   deprivation          of   rights    leading   to\n\nunlawful detention is on the petitioner.7                Walker v. Johnston, 312\n\n\n     6\n          Even under the broader view, the doctrine is not a broad\ndiscretionary criminal equity doctrine but takes into account\nsociety's interest in having prisoners serve their sentences, the\nneed to avoid intentional abuses of government power, and the\nimpact on a prisoner who has genuinely started a new life.\n     7\n          On a federal habeas petition, there is also a presumption\nof regularity of the sentence, which the petitioner must overcome.\nDaniels v. United States, 532 U.S. 374, 381 (2001); Johnson v.\n\n                                        -12-\n\fU.S. 275, 286 (1941); see also Waddington v. Sarausad, 129 S. Ct.\n\n823, 831 (2009); Smith v. Robbins, 528 U.S. 259, 285-86 (2000);\n\nBader v. Warden, 488 F.3d 483, 488 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n           As to the use of negligence in evaluating the claim, we\n\nwill assume the government was negligent in releasing Espinoza.\n\nIndeed, it strikes us that in virtually every case in which there\n\nwas a mistaken release of a prisoner there will have been some form\n\nof government negligence.       The degree of negligence and, indeed,\n\nwhether there was intentional error by the government may be highly\n\nrelevant considerations, but do not shift any burdens.           There are\n\nother   legal   reasons   for   this.     Courts   must   be   cautious   in\n\napproaching federal common law.         See Atherton v. FDIC, 519 U.S.\n\n213, 225-26 (1997) (requiring significant conflict with or threat\n\nto federal interest before allowing creation of federal common\n\nlaw); Mauser v. Raytheon Co. Pension Plan for Salaried Employees,\n\n239 F.3d 51, 57 (1st Cir. 2001) (stressing the need to \"exercise\n\ncaution in creating new common law rules\" under ERISA).\n\n           In addition, practical concerns support our view.              The\n\nBOP releases about 41,000 inmates a year; all U.S. correctional\n\nsystems combined release about 630,000 inmates a year.          D. Wall, A\n\nGame of Cat and Mouse -- or Government and Prisoner:              Granting\n\nRelief to an Erroneously Released Prisoner in Vega v. United\n\n\nZerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 468 (1938); Lema v. United States, 987 F.2d\n48, 51 (1st Cir. 1993); cf. United States v. Butt, 731 F.2d 75, 80\n(1st Cir. 1984) (motion to vacate sentence).\n\n                                   -13-\n\fStates, 53 Vill. L. Rev. 385, 386 n.9 (2008).          One court has noted\n\nthat erroneous releases are frequent, and thus not so uncommon as\n\nto raise an issue of executive branch arbitrariness.           Hawkins, 195\n\nF.3d at 742.\n\n            Petitioner argues that a broad understanding of the at\n\nliberty doctrine is necessary as a deterrent to mistakes being made\n\nby the executive.      That deterrence rationale is flawed; we doubt\n\nvery much that bureaucratic mistakes of the sort made here would be\n\nin the least deterred.     The U.S. Marshals service has no incentive\n\nto release prisoners contrary to rules.             Cf. Herring v. United\n\nStates, 129 S. Ct. 695, 700 (2009) (noting that Fourth Amendment\n\nexclusionary rule is meant to apply only where necessary to deter\n\nfuture governmental misconduct).\n\n            In the end, we need not define the outer reaches of the\n\ndoctrine.    We hold that Espinoza has not met his burden of showing\n\nthat the at liberty doctrine applies in this case.         We acknowledge\n\nthat Espinoza does not seek credit for his entire time at liberty\n\nbut only for that time following his mistaken release.           Still, the\n\nerroneous    release   happened   only    because   Espinoza   had   earlier\n\nescaped from his halfway house and this caused the need to process\n\nhim again when he was first apprehended.             Espinoza created the\n\nsituation.     But for his escape, the issue would not have arisen.\n\nThere was no intent by the government to string out the time\n\nEspinoza had to serve; this is plainly not a case of punishment of\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fthe prisoner on the installment plan.      There is not the slightest\n\nhint in the record that the mistake was motivated by a desire to\n\nsingle out Espinoza or by any improper motive.          Nor was there\n\narbitrariness or capriciousness by any government actor.      At most\n\nthere was a mistake; mistakes are simply part of life.\n\n            The at liberty doctrine, even in its broader incarnations\n\namong the circuit courts, was never meant to reward prisoners for\n\nescaping.     At common law, an escaped prisoner could not have\n\nreceived credit for the time he was at large, and there must not\n\nhave been any contributing fault on his part.      See White, 42 F.2d\n\nat 789.   A doctrine meant to protect against government abuses of\n\nprisoners through cat and mouse games of imprisonment cannot be\n\nturned into a game of catch me if you can.\n\n            The district court's rejection of the doctrine in this\n\ncase is affirmed.\n\nB.          Other Arguments\n\n            Espinoza also claims he is entitled to immediate release\n\nbecause the BOP erred in determining that his 1987 and 1997\n\nsentences were to run consecutively.       Thus, his ยง 2241 petition\n\nbefore the district court also challenged that BOP determination.\n\n            The initial question is one of the appropriate standards\n\nof review.    Our review of the district court's rejection of his\n\nhabeas claim is de novo.      See Teti v. Bender, 507 F.3d 50, 56 (1st\n\nCir. 2007).     Most circuits consider that the district court's\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\freview of a BOP decision about credits is for abuse of discretion.\n\nSee, e.g., Fegans v. United States, 506 F.3d 1101, 1105 (8th Cir.\n\n2007); Bintzler, 239 F. App'x at 275-76; see also United States v.\n\nWhite, 91 F. App'x 162, 163 (1st Cir. 2004) (per curiam) (noting\n\nthat the discretion to credit time served is vested in the Attorney\n\nGeneral,    through   the   BOP).     We     need   not   resolve   the    latter\n\nstandard.\n\n            Whether multiple terms of imprisonment are consecutive or\n\nconcurrent is governed by 18 U.S.C. ยง 3584(a), which states:\n\n            If multiple terms of imprisonment are imposed\n            on a defendant at the same time, or if a term\n            of imprisonment is imposed on a defendant who\n            is already subject to an undischarged term of\n            imprisonment, the terms may run concurrently\n            or consecutively . . . . Multiple terms of\n            imprisonment imposed at different times run\n            consecutively unless the court orders that the\n            terms are to run concurrently.\n\nThe   district    court   concluded    that    because    the   1987    and    1997\n\nsentences were imposed at different times, Espinoza was subject to\n\nthe   statutory    presumption      that     the    sentences    were     to    run\n\nconsecutively.     It held that Espinoza had offered nothing to rebut\n\nthe presumption.\n\n            On appeal, Espinoza argues that, because he had only two\n\nweeks remaining on his 1987 sentence at the time of his escape, the\n\nBOP could only credit two weeks of the time he spent in custody\n\nbetween his August 6, 1996 arrest and his March 10, 1997 sentencing\n\nto that sentence.     See 18 U.S.C. ยง 3585(b)(1).         He argues from this\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fhe   was   not   \"already    subject      to    an   undischarged     term    of\n\nimprisonment\"    within   the   meaning    of    ยง   3584(a),   and   thus   the\n\nstatutory presumption that his terms were consecutive did not\n\nattach.\n\n           Espinoza reaches this conclusion on the basis of his\n\nerroneous view that his presumptive parole date of January 9, 1994\n\nremained effective until the Parole Commission officially rescinded\n\nit on April 21, 1998.       The record is directly contrary.          Espinoza\n\nescaped from custody before reaching his presumptive parole date\n\nand that parole date was retarded.         Thus, he was not on parole and\n\nremained subject to the undischarged term of his sentence.\n\n           When the Parole Commission reopened and retarded his\n\npresumptive parole date in January 1994, it also scheduled a\n\nrescission hearing upon Espinoza's return to a federal institution.\n\nSee generally 28 C.F.R. ยง 2.34(a) (1993).8            Because Espinoza never\n\n\n     8\n          Espinoza's argument is incorrect that the Parole\nCommission violated a regulatory requirement that it hold a\nrescission hearing within 90 days of his return to federal custody.\nThe 90-day provision applies only to decisions to reopen and retard\nparole made without a hearing. See 28 C.F.R. ยง 2.34(a) (1993).\nBecause Espinoza committed new criminal behavior (the escape), he\nwas subject to a separate provision of ยง 2.34(a) under which a\nrescission hearing was scheduled for him \"on the first docket\nfollowing [his] return to a federal institution.\" Id.; see also\nU.S. Parole Comm'n, Rules & Procedures Manual 115, available at\nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/uspc/rules_procedures/uspc-manual111507.pdf.\nRegardless of the length of the delay, Espinoza cannot show he was\nprejudiced by it and thus it cannot serve as the basis for habeas\nrelief. Cf. White v. Hubbard, No. 95-1750, 1996 WL 86190, at *1\n(1st Cir. Feb. 29, 1996) (per curiam) (discussing delay in parole\nrevocation hearing); see also Tippins v. Luther, 869 F. Supp. 331,\n337 (W.D. Pa. 1994). Espinoza was not prejudiced because the delay\n\n                                   -17-\n\freached his presumptive parole date before he escaped and because\n\nthe Parole Commission reopened and retarded his parole date before\n\nhe was able to serve the time remaining on his sentence, he\n\nremained subject to his undischarged prison term.          He was serving\n\nthat   sentence,   which    had   approximately    22   months   remaining\n\nfactoring in good time credit, when the New Mexico federal district\n\ncourt sentenced him in March 1997.         The BOP so concluded.\n\n            Espinoza was subject to the presumption in ยง 3584(a) that\n\nhis 1997 sentence was to be served consecutively to his 1987\n\nsentence.    He has provided nothing to defeat that presumption.\n\n                                    III.\n\n            We   affirm    the    district   court's    order    dismissing\n\nEspinoza's habeas corpus petition under 28 U.S.C. ยง 2241.\n\n\n\n\nhad no effect on his ability to present a defense or on the length\nof his resulting sentence.\n\n                                    -18-\n\f",

Nancy Gertner, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                          Lynch, Chief Judge,\n                  Boudin and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Timothy G.

The primary issue raised on this\n\nfederal habeas appeal is whether an escaped prisoner can shorten\n\nhis term of actual incarceration under the common law doctrine of\n\ncredit for time erroneously at liberty because, after he was picked\n\nup, he was inadvertently released and remained at liberty for a\n\nperiod of fourteen months before he was eventually arrested again.\n\nThe district court answered this question \"No,\" Espinoza v. Sabol,\n\nNo. 06-cv-11974-NG (D. Mass. Apr. 30, 2008), and so do we.\n\n                                  I.\n\n            In 1987, Gilbert Espinoza was sentenced to a term of 84\n\nmonths' imprisonment for two federal drug convictions.     The U.S.\n\nParole Commission set a presumptive parole date of January 9, 1994\n\nfor Espinoza.    He never met that date while in custody and so was\n\nnot on parole.    Instead, about two weeks before his presumptive\n\nparole date, he escaped.   On December 26, 1993, he walked away from\n\nthe New Mexico halfway house in which he had been serving his\n\nsentence.   At that point, more than two years of the 84-month term\n\nremained to be served.\n\n            The Bureau of Prisons (\"BOP\") on January 6, 1994 found\n\nhim guilty of escape and subsequently made a recommendation to the\n\nParole Commission that his presumptive parole date be rescinded,\n\nafter a disciplinary hearing which Espinoza did not attend.      On\n\nJanuary 31, 1994, the Commission reopened and \"retarded\" his\n\npresumptive parole date and scheduled a rescission hearing to take\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fplace upon Espinoza's return to a federal institution.      See 28\n\nC.F.R. ยง 2.34(a) (1993).   \"Retard\" is a term of art in the parole\n\ncontext and means to postpone a presumptive parole date.   See King\n\nv. Simpson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765872\"><a href=\"/opinion/765872/eugene-t-king-jr-v-john-r-simpson-eastern-regional-commissioner/\"><span class=\"volume\">189</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">284</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 288 (2d Cir. 1999).    A criminal escape\n\ncharge under 18 U.S.C. ยง 751(a) was also filed against Espinoza in\n\nfederal court.\n\n          Espinoza remained at liberty until June 5, 1995, when\n\nstate authorities in New Mexico arrested him for shoplifting.1\n\nThey transferred him to the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service.\n\nFederal prosecutors declined to pursue the criminal escape charge.\n\nThe U.S. Marshals Service, rather than returning Espinoza to prison\n\nto serve the remainder of his sentence for the 1987 drug crimes,\n\nmistakenly released him from custody on June 7, 1995. Although the\n\nrecord is not clear, the Marshals seem to have booked Espinoza\n\nincorrectly -- Espinoza, whose full name is Gilbert Espinoza-Saenz,\n\nwas apparently misidentified as Gilbert Espinoza-Sanchez, a man of\n\napproximately the same age with a social security number similar to\n\nEspinoza's and who was not subject to a prison sentence at the\n\ntime.\n\n          Fourteen months later, on August 6, 1996, Espinoza was\n\narrested again, this time on new federal drug charges.   In federal\n\ncourt in New Mexico, he pled guilty and was sentenced to a term of\n\n\n\n     1\n          Espinoza concedes that he cannot obtain sentence credit\nfor the period between December 26, 1993 and June 5, 1995.\n\n                                -3-\n\f151 months' imprisonment on March 10, 1997.               The sentencing court\n\nwas aware of Espinoza's prior sentence -- Espinoza's pre-sentence\n\nreport noted that he had time remaining on his 1987 sentence and\n\nthat he had committed his new offense after escaping.                 The court\n\nwas not explicit as to whether Espinoza's new sentence should run\n\nconcurrently with his 1987 sentence or whether they should run\n\nconsecutively.\n\n             Upon Espinoza's return to custody and after a hearing on\n\nAugust 14, 1997, the BOP found him guilty of escape.                 The Parole\n\nCommission rescinded Espinoza's presumptive parole date on April\n\n21, 1998 on the basis of this finding, as well as based on his new\n\nconviction.         The   BOP    then     calculated    Espinoza's   period   of\n\nincarceration, concluding that he had to serve the remainder of his\n\n1987 sentence with credit for periods that he spent in custody,\n\nincluding the period of June 5-7, 1995.                 Because the New Mexico\n\nfederal district court had been silent as to whether Espinoza's new\n\nsentence would be served concurrently or consecutively with the\n\n1987 sentence, the BOP decided the question and concluded that the\n\nsentences were consecutive.             The result was that Espinoza served\n\nthe remainder of his 1987 sentence from August 6, 1996 to January\n\n10,   1999    and    began      serving    his   1997    sentence    immediately\n\nthereafter.\n\n             Espinoza filed a pro se petition for habeas relief under\n\n28 U.S.C. ยง 2241 in Massachusetts federal court, alleging that the\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fBOP had erred in calculating his period of incarceration and was\n\nrequiring him to serve time on the dismissed escape charge.               The\n\ncourt   appointed   counsel,    who    reframed   the    issues.     In    a\n\nsupplemental pleading, Espinoza argued that he was entitled to\n\ncredit against his sentence for the time he spent at liberty\n\nbetween June 7, 1995 and August 6, 1996 and that the BOP had erred\n\nin determining that his two sentences were to run consecutively.\n\n          On   April   30,   2008,    the   district   court   granted    the\n\ngovernment's motion to dismiss, holding that the June 5-7, 1995\n\ndetention did not recommence his sentence and thus did not trigger\n\nthe time at liberty doctrine and that the BOP had correctly\n\ndetermined that Espinoza's sentences were to run consecutively.\n\nThe court concluded that the Parole Commission had erred in not\n\nholding a rescission hearing within 90 days of Espinoza's return to\n\nfederal custody, see 28 C.F.R. ยง 2.34(a), but that this error did\n\nnot entitle Espinoza to additional sentence credit.\n\n                                     II.\n\nA.        The Doctrine of Credit for Time Erroneously at Liberty\n\n          Espinoza argues he should be given credit against his\n\nsentence for the time he spent erroneously at liberty.          Espinoza's\n\nargument is that because the U.S. Marshals Service erred (by\n\nconfusing him with a similarly named person with a like social\n\nsecurity number) in releasing him on June 7, 1995, he should be\n\ngiven credit through August 6, 1996, the date of his next arrest,\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\ftoward his sentence.   He says it was not his fault he was released\n\non June 7, 1995, but the government's, and so his final release\n\ndate should have been October 28, 2008 and not December 26, 2009.\n\n          The length of the term of actual imprisonment to be\n\nserved following a criminal conviction and sentence is subject to\n\nvarious constitutional and other legal restraints, both as to\n\nincreases and as to decreases of the time in confinement.        For\n\nexample, an increase in sentence after a defendant has begun to\n\nserve his sentence may contravene the constitutional prohibition\n\nagainst double jeopardy.    Breest v.

We will assume, in Espinoza's favor,\n\nthat he may seek relief even when no due process claim is stated.\n\n          In the federal criminal justice system, mechanisms for\n\ngranting credits that can be used to adjust time served have been\n\nlargely set by legislation.        For example, 18 U.S.C. ยง 3585(b)\n\nspecifies that a defendant convicted of a federal crime has a right\n\nto receive credit for certain time spent in official detention\n\nbefore his sentence begins.        That credit is determined by the\n\nAttorney General, not by a court.     See United States v.

In the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984,\n\nCongress, with few exceptions, abolished parole, which eliminated\n\none mechanism for allowing prisoners credit to reduce their time\n\nserved.   Prisoners   may   now    receive   credit   only   in   carefully\n\ncircumscribed situations, such as for their good behavior while\n\nincarcerated.4   See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. ยง 3624(b) (allowing grant of\n\ncredit toward the service of a sentence for satisfactory behavior).\n\nThe relationship between the release date and credits to be given\n\nfor satisfactory behavior is set forth in 18 U.S.C. ยง 3624.

See Wilson, 503 U.S. at 335-36.\n\nBy definition, arguments such as Espinoza's are presented to courts\n\nwhen the executive branch officials, exercising whatever discretion\n\nhas been allotted to them, have decided not to give the prisoner\n\nthe credits he seeks.\n\n            Second, concerns may be raised about whether the asserted\n\nfederal common law doctrine alone survives the Sentencing Reform\n\nAct of 1984.    See G.J. Chin, Getting Out of Jail Free: Sentence\n\nCredits for Periods of Mistaken Liberty, 45 Cath. U. L. Rev. 403,\n\n404 (1996).    The answer to that question is neither briefed to us\n\nnor necessary to our conclusion.

We hold that Espinoza has not met his burden of showing\n\nthat the at liberty doctrine applies in this case.         We acknowledge\n\nthat Espinoza does not seek credit for his entire time at liberty\n\nbut only for that time following his mistaken release.           Still, the\n\nerroneous    release   happened   only    because   Espinoza   had   earlier\n\nescaped from his halfway house and this caused the need to process\n\nhim again when he was first apprehended.             Espinoza created the\n\nsituation.     But for his escape, the issue would not have arisen.\n\nThere was no intent by the government to string out the time\n\nEspinoza had to serve; this is plainly not a case of punishment of\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fthe prisoner on the installment plan.      There is not the slightest\n\nhint in the record that the mistake was motivated by a desire to\n\nsingle out Espinoza or by any improper motive.          Nor was there\n\narbitrariness or capriciousness by any government actor.      At most\n\nthere was a mistake; mistakes are simply part of life.\n\n            The at liberty doctrine, even in its broader incarnations\n\namong the circuit courts, was never meant to reward prisoners for\n\nescaping.     At common law, an escaped prisoner could not have\n\nreceived credit for the time he was at large, and there must not\n\nhave been any contributing fault on his part.      See White, 42 F.2d\n\nat 789.   A doctrine meant to protect against government abuses of\n\nprisoners through cat and mouse games of imprisonment cannot be\n\nturned into a game of catch me if you can.\n\n            The district court's rejection of the doctrine in this\n\ncase is affirmed.\n\nB.          Other Arguments\n\n            Espinoza also claims he is entitled to immediate release\n\nbecause the BOP erred in determining that his 1987 and 1997\n\nsentences were to run consecutively.       Thus, his ยง 2241 petition\n\nbefore the district court also challenged that BOP determination.\n\n            The initial question is one of the appropriate standards\n\nof review.    Our review of the district court's rejection of his\n\nhabeas claim is de novo.      See Teti v.

We     need   not   resolve   the    latter\n\nstandard.\n\n            Whether multiple terms of imprisonment are consecutive or\n\nconcurrent is governed by 18 U.S.C. ยง 3584(a), which states:\n\n            If multiple terms of imprisonment are imposed\n            on a defendant at the same time, or if a term\n            of imprisonment is imposed on a defendant who\n            is already subject to an undischarged term of\n            imprisonment, the terms may run concurrently\n            or consecutively . . . . Multiple terms of\n            imprisonment imposed at different times run\n            consecutively unless the court orders that the\n            terms are to run concurrently.\n\nThe   district    court   concluded    that    because    the   1987    and    1997\n\nsentences were imposed at different times, Espinoza was subject to\n\nthe   statutory    presumption      that     the    sentences    were     to    run\n\nconsecutively.     It held that Espinoza had offered nothing to rebut\n\nthe presumption.\n\n            On appeal, Espinoza argues that, because he had only two\n\nweeks remaining on his 1987 sentence at the time of his escape, the\n\nBOP could only credit two weeks of the time he spent in custody\n\nbetween his August 6, 1996 arrest and his March 10, 1997 sentencing\n\nto that sentence.     See 18 U.S.C. ยง 3585(b)(1).         He argues from this\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fhe   was   not   \"already    subject      to    an   undischarged     term    of\n\nimprisonment\"    within   the   meaning    of    ยง   3584(a),   and   thus   the\n\nstatutory presumption that his terms were consecutive did not\n\nattach.\n\n           Espinoza reaches this conclusion on the basis of his\n\nerroneous view that his presumptive parole date of January 9, 1994\n\nremained effective until the Parole Commission officially rescinded\n\nit on April 21, 1998.       The record is directly contrary.          Espinoza\n\nescaped from custody before reaching his presumptive parole date\n\nand that parole date was retarded.         Thus, he was not on parole and\n\nremained subject to the undischarged term of his sentence.\n\n           When the Parole Commission reopened and retarded his\n\npresumptive parole date in January 1994, it also scheduled a\n\nrescission hearing upon Espinoza's return to a federal institution.\n\nSee generally 28 C.F.R. ยง 2.34(a) (1993).8            Because Espinoza never\n\n\n     8\n          Espinoza's argument is incorrect that the Parole\nCommission violated a regulatory requirement that it hold a\nrescission hearing within 90 days of his return to federal custody.\nThe 90-day provision applies only to decisions to reopen and retard\nparole made without a hearing. See 28 C.F.R. ยง 2.34(a) (1993).\nBecause Espinoza committed new criminal behavior (the escape), he\nwas subject to a separate provision of ยง 2.34(a) under which a\nrescission hearing was scheduled for him \"on the first docket\nfollowing [his] return to a federal institution.\" Id.; see also\nU.S. Parole Comm'n, Rules & Procedures Manual 115, available at\nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/uspc/rules_procedures/uspc-manual111507.pdf.\nRegardless of the length of the delay, Espinoza cannot show he was\nprejudiced by it and thus it cannot serve as the basis for habeas\nrelief.

Espinoza was not prejudiced because the delay\n\n                                   -17-\n\freached his presumptive parole date before he escaped and because\n\nthe Parole Commission reopened and retarded his parole date before\n\nhe was able to serve the time remaining on his sentence, he\n\nremained subject to his undischarged prison term.          He was serving\n\nthat   sentence,   which    had   approximately    22   months   remaining\n\nfactoring in good time credit, when the New Mexico federal district\n\ncourt sentenced him in March 1997.         The BOP so concluded.\n\n            Espinoza was subject to the presumption in ยง 3584(a) that\n\nhis 1997 sentence was to be served consecutively to his 1987\n\nsentence.    He has provided nothing to defeat that presumption.\n\n                                    III.\n\n            We   affirm    the    district   court's    order    dismissing\n\nEspinoza's habeas corpus petition under 28 U.S.C. ยง 2241.\n\n\n\n\nhad no effect on his ability to present a defense or on the length\nof his resulting sentence.\n\n                                    -18-\n\f</pre>",
