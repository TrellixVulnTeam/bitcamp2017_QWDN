O'Toole, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                Lipez and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Thomas M. Furtado, Memorandum in Support of a Certificate of\nAppealability pro se.\n\n\n\n                           February 18, 2005\n\f           Per Curiam.    Thomas M. Furtado seeks a certificate of\n\nappealability (COA) to appeal from the denial of his second Rule\n\n60(b) motion to obtain relief from the dismissal of his petition\n\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 2254 because it was \"mixed,\" containing both\n\nexhausted and unexhausted claims.         Because the district court did\n\nnot address the merits of Furtado's claims, a COA should may issue\n\nif he has shown that \"(1) the soundness of the procedural ruling is\n\ndebatable, and (2) the constitutional claim is also colorable.\n\nSlack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484-85 (2000).\" Mateo v. United\n\nStates, 310 F.3d 39, 40 (1st Cir. 2002).         Because Furtado cannot\nmeet the merits prong of the COA test, we need not determine\n\nwhether the procedural prong has been satisfied.\n           1. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n           Petitioner's one exhausted claim is that the district\n\ncourt   violated his due process rights by denying his motion for a\nrequired finding of not guilty where \"no evidence of identification\nwas presented.\" The constitutional standard for sufficiency of the\n\nevidence claims is whether \"viewing the evidence in the light most\nfavorable to the prosecution, . . . no rational trier of fact could\nhave found, beyond a reasonable doubt, sufficient evidence of the\n\ncrime for which the defendant was convicted.\" Joseph v. Fair, 763\n\nF.2d 9, 10 (1st Cir. 1985) (citing Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307\n\n(1979)).\n\n           A   summary   of   the   evidence    is   set    forth   in   the\nMassachusetts Appeals Court decision, Commonwealth v. Furtado, 53\n\nMass. App. Ct. 1108, 2001 WL 1609078 (2001).               Based upon that\n\n                                    -2-\n\fevidence, petitioner cannot make even a colorable claim that no\n\nrational    juror    could   have   found,     beyond    a    reasonable   doubt,\n\nsufficient evidence that Furtado was one of the perpetrators of the\ncharged offenses of armed robbery and assault with intent to rob.\n\nFurtado's main argument here is that the identification evidence\n\nwas entirely circumstantial.         However, \"[t]he government need not\nproduce     direct    evidence      to     meet    its       burden   of   proof:\n\n'circumstantial evidence, if it meets all the other criteria of\n\nadmissibility, is just as appropriate as direct evidence and is\n\nentitled to be given whatever weight the jury deems it should be\n\ngiven under the circumstances within which it unfolds.'\" United\n\nStates v. Hughes, 211 F.3d 676, 681 (1st Cir. 2000) (citations\n\nomitted).\n            2. Jury Coercion\n\n            The constitutional right at issue here is the right to an\n\nuncoerced verdict.      \"Any criminal defendant . . . being tried by a\njury is entitled to the uncoerced verdict of that body.\" Lowenfield\n\nv. Phelps, 484 U.S. 231, 241 (1988).              This court has stated that\n\n\"[a]ny supplemental instruction in response to a jury's deadlock\n\ncan have a significant coercive effect by intimating that some jury\n\nmembers should capitulate to others' views, or by suggesting that\n\nthe members should compromise their rational positions in order to\n\nreach agreement.\" United States v. Hernandez-Albino, 177 F.3d 33,\n\n38 (1st Cir. 1999).     But this court has also recognized that \"[t]he\n\nright not to be put twice to the bar is of a very high order,\"\n\nUnited States v. Hotz, 620 F.2d 5, 6 (1st Cir. 1980), and that a\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fjudge should exercise his discretion to declare a mistrial on the\n\nbasis that the jury has reached an impasse, only \"with great\n\nreluctance.\" Id. at 7.\n            Furtado has not made even a colorable claim of jury\n\ncoercion.       \"Where . . . the judge reasonably concludes that the\n\njury is not deadlocked . . . , the defendant is not prejudiced by\na simple instruction to continue deliberating.\" United States v.\n\nFigueroa-Encarnaciòn, 343 F.3d 23, 32 (1st Cir. 2003), cert. denied,\n\n540 U.S. 1140 (2004).      And the district court's failure to grant\n\ndefense    counsel's    request   for     a   second   instruction    on   the\n\ngovernment's burden of proof did not create a colorable due process\n\nissue. Under similar circumstances this court has held that \"[t]he\n\nfailure of the trial court to reinstruct the jury on the burden of\nproof     was    not   constitutionally       defective   since      extensive\n\ninstructions had been previously given.\" Salemme v. Ristaino, 587\n\nF.2d 81, 89 (1st Cir. 1978).      Finally, there was no colorable claim\nof constitutional magnitude stemming from the jury's communication\n\nof its division on the question whether further deliberations could\nassist them in returning a verdict. See Lowenfield, 484 U.S. at\n\n240.\n\n            3. References by Prosecutor to Excluded Evidence\n\n            Furtado argued that his due process rights were violated\n\nby the prosecutor's improper conduct in ignoring the court's in\n\nlimine order excluding any statements made by the deceased victim.\n\nProsecutorial misconduct violates a petitioner's due process rights\n\nonly \"if the conduct 'so infected the trial with unfairness as to\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fmake the resulting conviction a denial of due process.'\"                    Moreno-\n\nMorales v. United States, 334 F.3d 140, 148 (1st Cir. 2003).                      The\n\nAppeals Court found that \"the judge submitted the case to the jury\nsolely as a circumstantial evidence case.\" Furtado, 2001 WL 1609078\n\nat ***1 n.2.     The court also supportably found that \"[v]iewed in\n\nthe   light    most    favorable   to    the    Commonwealth     .     .    .,    the\ncircumstantial        evidence   and    the    reasonable    inferences          drawn\n\ntherefrom     were    sufficient   for    a    jury   to    conclude       beyond    a\n\nreasonable doubt that the defendants were the robbers.\" Id. at\n\n***1. Under these circumstances, Furtado has not made a colorable\n\nclaim that any misconduct by the prosecutor in referring to Jones'\n\nidentification of the defendants deprived Furtado of a fair trial.\n\n            4. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n            Finally, Furtado claimed that he was denied effective\n\nassistance of counsel because his attorney 1) did not move for a\n\nmistrial on the ground that the jury was deadlocked, and 2)\n\"fail[ed] to join in the Motion to Strike when the prosecutor\n\nignored the court's earlier ruling that Jones' statements were\n\ninadmissible.\"        Petitioner cannot make a colorable showing of\n\nprejudice as to either claim.            A motion for a mistrial for the\n\ndistrict court's alleged failure to conform to Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\n\n234, § 34 would not have succeeded.                The failure to join co-\n\ndefendant's motion to strike did not prejudice Furtado because the\n\nmotion was granted.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\f          We conclude that Furtado's § 2254 claims are not even\n\ncolorable.   Therefore, his request for a COA is denied and the\n\nappeal is terminated.\n\n\n\n\n                              -6-\n\f",
