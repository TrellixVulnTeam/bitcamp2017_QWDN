Juan M. Pérez-Giménez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n              Lynch, Lipez, and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Carlos R. Ramirez and John F. Nevares & Associates, PSC on\nbrief for appellant.\n     Roberto J. Sánchez-Ramos, Solicitor General, Kenneth Pamias-\nVelázquez, Deputy Solicitor General, and Irene S. Soroeta-Kodesh,\nAssistant Solicitor General, on brief for appellees Ramón Cantero-\nFrau, William Riefkohl, Blanca I. Mera, Carmen González, Armando\nPortalatín and Hilda Rivera-Santiago, in their individual\ncapacities.\n     Carl Schuster, Mariela Rexach Rexach and Schuster Usera &\nAguiló LLP on brief for appellee William Riefkohl, in his official\ncapacity.\n\n\n                            February 18, 2005\n\f            Per Curiam.    Plaintiff Eddie Otero-Varcálcel sued his\n\nemployer, the Puerto Rico Industrial Development Company (PRIDCO),1\n\nand several fellow employees, claiming, inter alia, that he had\n\nbeen systematically stripped of his duties and responsibilities\n\nbecause of his political affiliation in violation of his First\n\nAmendment rights.     Otero, who is a member of the New Progressive\n\nParty (NPP), alleges that these privations occurred following the\n\n2000 election in which the Popular Democratic Party (PDP) took\n\npower in Puerto Rico (and control of PRIDCO).      At the conclusion of\n\ndiscovery, the       district court awarded the defendants summary\n\njudgment, because Otero held a policy-making position for which\n\npolitical affiliation is a permissible requirement.        In so ruling,\n\nthe court considered only the evidence submitted by the defendants\n\nbecause Otero’s opposition papers were not timely filed.\n\n            Otero’s principal appellate argument is that the district\n\ncourt abused its discretion when it declined to take account of his\n\nopposition materials, which were due within ten days of the filing\n\nof the defendants’ motion.       See D.P.R. L.R. 311.5, 311.12 (2002)\n\n(repealed    2004)   (imposing   a    ten-day   response   deadline   and\n\nauthorizing the court to deem admitted any material facts not\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      PRIDCO is a Puerto Rico public corporation created to\n“promote, persuade and induce private capital to initiate and\nmaintain in operation . . . all kinds of commercial, cooperative or\nmining operations . . . .” 23 P.R. Laws Ann. § 275 (2002).\n\n                                     -2-\n\fcontroverted by timely opposition).2          After repeated requests for\n\nextensions, only the first of which was granted, Otero submitted\n\nhis opposition four days after the extended deadline (and one day\n\nbeyond the final date he requested).\n\n            “This court has held repeatedly that the district court\n\nin Puerto Rico is justified in holding one party’s submitted\n\nuncontested facts to be admitted when the other party fails to file\n\noppositions in compliance with local rules.”               Torres-Rosado v.\n\nRotger-Sabat, 335 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2003) (collecting cases).\n\nHere, the court explained that it was rejecting Otero’s submission\n\nnot only because it was untimely, but also because Otero had\n\npreviously ignored a discovery order and had played a “prominent\n\nrole” in delaying the entire pretrial process.                  The court was\n\nwithin its discretion in ruling as it did.            See Young v. Gordon,\n\n330 F.3d 76, 81-82 (1st Cir. 2003) (affirming district court’s\n\nsanction of dismissal for, inter alia, noncompliance with court\n\norders and failing to meet self-imposed deadlines).\n\n            Otero also challenges the merits of the summary judgment\n\nruling,   but    he   provides   us   with   no   basis   for   upsetting   the\n\njudgment.       “[W]hen a trial court accurately sizes up a case,\n\napplies the law faultlessly to the discerned facts, decides the\n\nmatter, and articulates a convincing rationale for the decision,\n\n\n\n     2\n      Local Rule 311 was replaced with Local Rule 7.1, effective\nApril 5, 2004, which maintains the ten-day requirement.\n\n                                      -3-\n\fthere is no need for a reviewing court to wax longiloquent.”\n\nVargas-Ruiz v. Golden Arch Development, Inc., 368 F.3d 1, 2 (1st\n\nCir. 2004).   We therefore add only the following brief comments.\n\n          The   district   court’s    ruling   was   rooted   in    a\n\ndetermination, based on the job description submitted by the\n\ndefendants with their summary judgment papers, that Otero held a\n\npolicy-making position at PRIDCO, and thus could be demoted or\n\nterminated because of his political affiliation.3     See Rutan v.\n\nRepub. Party of Ill., 497 U.S. 62 (1990); Branti v. Finkel, 445\n\nU.S. 507 (1980); Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347 (1976).         Otero\n\ncontends that the evidence he submitted, whichkfg the court did not\n\nconsider, generated a trialworthy issue as to whether, in fact, he\n\nheld a policy-making position. But the evidence Otero attempted to\n\nintroduce showed only that Otero had not personally wielded many of\n\nthe policy-making powers listed in the job description.        This\n\nargument fails because “the analysis must focus upon the powers\n\ninherent in a given office, as opposed to the functions performed\n\nby a particular occupant of that office.” O’Conner v. Steeves, 994\n\nF.2d 905, 911 (1st Cir. 1993) (citation and internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted). The official job description is the best objective\n\n     3\n      Otero holds the position of Director of Labor Relations,\nwhich is listed in the trust service as one of free selection and\nremoval.   The position’s responsibilities include, among other\nthings, formulating and implementing the public policy related to\nlabor relations, advising PRIDCO’s Executive Director and other\nhigh-ranking managerial personnel, administering the assigned\noffice budget, and establishing contacts with high-level officials\nin both the private and public sectors.\n\n                                -4-\n\fevidence of the powers inherent in a given office.   See Mendez-\n\nPalou v. Rohena-Betancourt, 813 F.2d 1255, 1260 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\nThus, the defendants would have been entitled to summary judgment\n\neven had Otero’s materials been considered.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -5-\n\f",
