This       case      explores      the\n\nMassachusetts law of close corporations and the ability of those\n\ncorporations to give releases of claims of self-dealing.                        A jury\n\nfound that the defendants, an officer/director and the controlling\n\nshareholders      in    two    close    family    corporations,          had   unjustly\n\nenriched themselves           from   corporate    funds      in   the    sum   of   over\n\n$380,000.        This   appeal       concerns    whether      that      liability     was\n\nextinguished by a release in favor of the defendants that was\n\nexecuted    by   the    corporation       and    its    remaining       directors     and\n\nshareholders on March 31, 1990, as part of mutual releases given in\n\nconnection with a stock redemption of the defendants' shares.                          If\n\nliability is extinguished, then the plaintiffs, who are creditors\n\nin bankruptcy standing in the shoes of the corporation, cannot\n\nrecover on the jury verdict.\n\n            The district court did not reach the questions about the\n\nvalidity and enforceability of the release because it ruled that\n\nthe creditors could not assert such claims -- essentially, that\n\nthey lacked standing.            While that standing analysis has some\n\nattraction, it is ultimately unpersuasive. The questions about the\n\nrelease will have to be addressed on remand because this record\n\ndoes not    permit      their    resolution.           No   Massachusetts      case    is\n\ndirectly on point as to the standards to be used.                        This opinion\n\nattempts to provide guidance for the case on remand, in an area of\n\nlaw marked by ambiguity and inconsistency.\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\f                                  I.\n\n          Mi-Lor Corporation was in the business of manufacturing,\n\ndistributing, and selling plastic dental and hair products, such as\n\ntoothbrushes and combs. The company was formed under Massachusetts\n\nlaw in 1977 by three family groupings -- the Robert Gottsegen\n\nfamily, the Stuart Gottsegen family, and the Lawrence Gottsegen\n\nfamily1 -- and an individual named Larry Wald.         Robert was the\n\npresident of the company, and he, Stuart, and Wald served as Mi-\n\nLor's directors.   Lawrence was primarily responsible for sales;\n\nWald was responsible for Mi-Lor's financial operations.\n\n          Robert's children, Lori and Michael, and Robert's ex-\n\nwife, Dorothy, were stockholders of the company, as were Stuart,\n\nLawrence, and Wald.2   Two trusts, one for the benefit of Michael\n\nand one for the benefit of Lori, also owned Mi-Lor stock.     Lawrence\n\nwas the trustee of both trusts.   Although Robert did not own Mi-Lor\n\nstock, he effectively controlled the company in his capacity as the\n\nsole voting trustee of a voting trust that owned sixty-five percent\n\nof Mi-Lor's voting stock.   Wald was the only stockholder who was\n\nnot a member of the voting trust.      The voting trust included all of\n\nthe stock held by Dorothy, Lori, Michael, and the two trusts.       To\n\nthe extent that Robert's interests were aligned with the interests\n\n\n     1\n          Stuart is Robert's brother and Lawrence is Robert's\ncousin.\n     2\n          Arthur Gottsegen, John Bambera, and Anthony Glydon were\nstockholders initially, but they sold their stock in the 1980s.\n\n                                  -4-\n\fof the other members of his family unit, the Robert Gottsegen group\n\neffectively functioned as one unit in three intertwined capacities:\n\nas the president, as a director, and as the majority shareholder of\n\nMi-Lor.\n\n          Professional Brush, Inc. (\"Pro Brush\") was formed in 1987\n\nand was in the business of manufacturing, distributing, and selling\n\ntoothbrushes and other dental care products.          Robert was president\n\nand a director of the company; Lawrence, Stuart, and Wald were the\n\nother directors.     Michael and Lori owned Pro Brush stock, as did\n\nSteven Gottsegen, Stuart, and Wald.\n\n          In 1989, Robert suffered a heart attack.            On March 31,\n\n1990, pursuant to a stock redemption agreement, Mi-Lor redeemed all\n\nof the shares held by Michael, Lori, Dorothy, and the two trusts.\n\nAs of the same date, the voting trust was terminated, Robert\n\nresigned as both president and director, and the management of the\n\ncorporation   changed     accordingly.3   As   part    of   the    redemption\n\nagreement, in exchange for 2,480 shares of stock and for other\n\nconsideration      (including    \"consulting,      confidentiality         and\n\nnoncompetition\"     agreements     with   Robert      and    Dorothy,      and\n\n\"confidentiality    and    noncompetition\"   agreements     with    Lori   and\n\n\n     3\n          Initially, Wald became president and Lawrence filled the\ndirector position vacated by Robert.    Then, after Wald died in\n1991, Stuart became president and Steven, Lawrence's son, filled\nthe vacant director position.      After Wald's death, Lawrence\nallegedly first discovered and investigated Wald's misuse of\ncorporate funds. Mi-Lor filed suit in state court against Wald's\nestate in July 1992.\n\n                                   -5-\n\fMichael), Mi-Lor assigned to Michael, Lori, Dorothy, and the\n\ntrustee of the two trusts the proceeds (totaling approximately $1\n\nmillion) from the merger of Solo Products, Inc. into Mi-Lor and\n\ngranted them entitlements to receive certain other payments.\n\n          Also on March 31, 1990, Michael and Lori entered into a\n\nstock redemption agreement with Pro Brush, whereby Michael and Lori\n\neach received twenty-five dollars in exchange for the 625 shares of\n\nPro Brush stock that each held.       Pursuant to a provision in this\n\nredemption agreement, Robert resigned as president and director of\n\nPro Brush.\n\n          As   part   of   the   Mi-Lor   stock   redemption   agreement,4\n\nRobert, Dorothy, Lori, Michael, and the two trusts (the \"Redeeming\n\nPrincipals\" or the \"Robert Gottsegen group\") also entered into an\n\nAgreement of Mutual Release (the \"Release\") with the company and\n\nits remaining principals5 on March 31, 1990.        Under its terms, Mi-\n\nLor and its remaining shareholders agreed to release the Redeeming\n\nPrincipals from \"any and all actions, causes of action, damages, .\n\n. . claims or demands of whatever kind or nature . . . which the\n\n\n     4\n          Several agreements were executed ancillary to the Mi-Lor\nstock redemption agreement. Pursuant to a consulting agreement,\nfor example, Robert remained connected to Mi-Lor. Within a year of\nthe stock transaction, Robert instituted an arbitration proceeding\nto force Mi-Lor to pay him according to the terms of the consulting\nagreement. The parties settled and Mi-Lor agreed to pay Robert.\n     5\n          The remaining principals were Wald, Stuart, Lawrence,\nJoan Gottsegen, Steven Gottsegen, and four trusts (two for which\nLawrence served as trustee and two for which Sandra Gottsegen\nserved as trustee).\n\n                                   -6-\n\fCompany and Remaining Principals ever had or claimed to have\"\n\nrelating to \"any act, omission, cause or thing done or omitted\"\n\nwith respect to the \"formation, incorporation or operation of the\n\nCompany . . . .\"    The Release excluded claims related to \"the\n\ncontinuing obligations owed by the Redeeming Principals . . . under\n\nthe terms . . . of the Redemption Agreement ... and the collateral\n\n. . . agreements\" and claims arising from \"any legal proceeding\n\ninitiated by Alfred Stauble.\"   The Release was signed by all of Mi-\n\nLor's shareholders and all of its directors.     It is this release\n\nthat is at issue here.\n\n          In June 1994, the Redeeming Principals sued Mi-Lor in\n\nstate court alleging that they were owed additional payments under\n\nthe stock redemption agreement based on Mi-Lor's attainment of a\n\nspecified level of pre-tax earnings.     They also alleged fraud on\n\nthe part of Mi-Lor in the termination of the voting trust.        A\n\ndefault judgment was entered against Mi-Lor for $226,984.80, and\n\nthe voting trust was reinstated.        On February 10, 1995, the\n\nRedeeming Principals and Mi-Lor entered into a settlement agreement\n\nwhereby the voting trust was again terminated and Robert was\n\nelected a director but agreed not to prevent Mi-Lor from filing for\n\nbankruptcy.\n\n          On March 3, 1995, Mi-Lor and Pro Brush voluntarily filed\n\nChapter 11 petitions.    On February 28, 1997, Mi-Lor and Pro Brush,\n\nas debtors-in-possession, brought an adversary proceeding against\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fthe Redeeming Principals alleging a host of claims.         Among other\n\nthings, the complaint alleged that the Redeeming Principals had\n\ncaused Mi-Lor to pay for their personal expenses and make other\n\nexpenditures for their benefit that had no legitimate corporate\n\npurpose.6     The   defendants'   affirmative   defenses   included   the\n\nRelease and the statute of limitations.\n\n            On November 2, 1998, the bankruptcy court confirmed the\n\nSecond Amended Liquidating Joint Plan of Reorganization of the\n\nDebtors.    The court's order established that all property of the\n\nMi-Lor and Pro Brush bankruptcy estates would thereafter be vested\n\nin the Creditors Trust and that the trustees of the Creditors Trust\n\nwould succeed to the debtors' right to bring or continue causes of\n\naction.     Subsequently, James M. Liston and John J. Monaghan, in\n\ntheir capacity as Creditors Trustees, replaced Mi-Lor and Pro Brush\n\nas plaintiffs in the corporations' suit against the Redeeming\n\nPrincipals.\n\n            The defendants moved for summary judgment based on the\n\nrelease and statute of limitations defenses, and the bankruptcy\n\ncourt denied the motion on February 26, 1999.       On May 7, 1999, the\n\nbankruptcy court sua sponte vacated its February 26 order and\n\ngranted partial summary judgment to the plaintiffs on the statute\n\nof limitations defense.    Discovery ensued.     The defendants filed a\n\n\n     6\n          It was through the discovery proceeding in the state suit\nagainst Wald's estate (see supra note 3) that Lawrence claims to\nhave first learned of Robert's misuse of Mi-Lor funds.\n\n                                   -8-\n\fmotion to vacate the May 7 order in December 2000, and the district\n\ncourt denied that motion on January 25, 2001 after de novo review.\n\n            During the five day trial in April 2001, the parties\n\ndisagreed, among other things, about the extent to which the\n\ndefendants    had    received   personal      payments,   about   whether   the\n\ndefendants had reimbursed the company for the payments of personal\n\nexpenses they did receive, and about whether the defendants had made\n\nloans to the company.        There was general agreement, however, that\n\nMi-Lor funds were indeed used to pay the personal expenses of the\n\ndefendants      in     the      first     instance,       and     that   other\n\ndirectors/shareholders in Mi-Lor also received payments of personal\n\nexpenses.     By agreement, the release defense was not submitted to\n\nthe jury.\n\n             In a special verdict, the jury found that Mi-Lor had paid\n\n$380,807.66 of the Redeeming Principals' personal, non-business\n\nexpenses and that the Redeeming Principals had not reimbursed Mi-Lor\n\nfor such payments.7 Among the allegedly unreimbursed payments shown\n\nto have been made to Robert and other members of his family unit\n\nwere country club dues and expenses; payments to pharmacies for\n\nmedications; automobile expenses; payments for telephone calls from\n\n\n     7\n          The special verdict did not specifically characterize the\nfinding as one of \"unjust enrichment.\" The district court's August\n17, 2001 memorandum and order stated that the \"jury found in favor\nof the plaintiffs on the unjust enrichment claim.\" The defendants\ndid not raise an objection to the characterization of the jury\nverdict as a finding of unjust enrichment and have waived the\nissue.\n\n                                        -9-\n\fRobert's home in Bermuda; legal fees for litigation to which Mi-Lor\n\nwas not a party; payments to Robert's divorce lawyers; monthly\n\npayments to Robert's mother; rent payments for an apartment occupied\n\nby Michael; and monthly payments to Dorothy.\n\n          The parties filed motions for judgment as a matter of law\n\nunder Rule 50 regarding whether the Release should bar the unjust\n\nenrichment claim, and the district court scheduled an evidentiary\n\nhearing on that issue. The parties then agreed to have the district\n\ncourt decide the issues pertaining to the Release without hearing\n\nfurther evidence, so the district court cancelled the hearing.\n\n          The district court's memorandum and order on the parties'\n\nrespective motions for judgment as a matter of law concluded,\n\nagainst the plaintiffs, that the Release was (1) executed by Mi-Lor,\n\nbecause there was sufficient evidence that Mi-Lor had assented to\n\nit, despite its formal shortcomings, and (2) enforceable, because\n\nit was executed at a time when no duties were owed to Mi-Lor's\n\ncreditors.    The district court entered judgment in favor of the\n\ndefendants.\n\n          The   Creditors   Trustees   appeal   the   district   court's\n\ndecisions to deny their motion for judgment as a matter of law\n\nregarding the Release and to allow the defendants' motion for\n\njudgment as a matter of law.    The defendants' cross-appeal on the\n\nstatute of limitations ruling argues that their statutory and\n\n\n\n\n                                -10-\n\fconstitutional rights were violated when the bankruptcy court sua\n\nsponte granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs on May 7, 1999.\n\n                                 II.\n\nA.   Creditors Trustees as Plaintiffs\n\n           The district court construed the question of the validity\n\nand enforceability of the Release as an issue of law.       It first\n\ndetermined that the Release had been executed by the corporation,\n\neven though no signature qua corporation was designated.8    It also\n\ndetermined that the broad scope of the Release would cover the\n\nunjust enrichment claims, if the Release was deemed valid and\n\nenforceable.\n\n           The district court then explained that the corporation's\n\nshareholders could have brought a derivative action if the unjustly\n\nenriched participants had acted to the detriment of the corporation\n\nin   executing the Release.      However, the court held that the\n\nplaintiffs here were creditors and could not bring an action\n\nchallenging the Release unless its execution contributed to the\n\ncorporation's insolvency or took place while the corporation was\n\ninsolvent.     Because the corporation was not insolvent at the time\n\nof the Release and there was no evidence suggesting that the Release\n\ncontributed to its subsequent insolvency, the court ruled:\n\n\n\n      8\n          The plaintiffs argued that no one had signed the Release\nspecifically on behalf of Mi-Lor.      The plaintiffs' attack is\nwithout merit. There was ample evidence to support the district\ncourt's factual determination.\n\n                                 -11-\n\f           While shareholders may have been able to object to the\n           Release, in fact, every shareholder signed it. The fact\n           that Mi-Lor is presently insolvent does not mean that the\n           Release suddenly becomes invalid as a result of duties\n           owed to creditors or to the corporation on behalf of the\n           creditors.   Invalidating the Release years after its\n           execution because of its adverse effects on creditors'\n           interests would create fiduciary duties to creditors\n           where they simply do not exist.\n\nAccordingly, the court did not reach the questions raised about the\n\nvalidity and enforceability of the Release.\n\n           On appeal, the plaintiffs argue that the court applied the\n\nwrong analytical principles in choosing to deny creditors the\n\nability   to     pursue   claims    as    substitute   plaintiffs   for   the\n\ncorporation.     They argue that the company, as debtor-in-possession,\n\nproperly filed an adversary proceeding              against the defendants\n\npursuant to the rules of the federal bankruptcy system.                   This\n\nposition is correct.      A corporation may bring an action against its\n\ndirectors,     current    or   former,   for   self-dealing.    See   Boston\n\nChildren's Heart Foundation, Inc. v. Nadal-Ginard, 73 F.3d 429 (1st\n\nCir. 1996) (applying Massachusetts law). And a debtor-in-possession\n\nmay   commence    an   action   without     court   approval.   Collier    on\n\nBankruptcy ¶ 323.01 (15th ed. rev.).\n\n           The Creditors Trustees then argue that, by order of the\n\nbankruptcy court, they properly stepped into the shoes of the\n\ncorporation as plaintiffs.         In those shoes, they are asserting the\n\ncorporation's right to recover to the estate the amount of the\n\nunjust enrichment.        That they, as creditors, would be the real\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fbeneficiaries of any recovery is, they say, happenstance and does\n\nnot alter the fact that they sue in the shoes of the company.    The\n\ndefendants do not contest this proposition; indeed, no objection was\n\nmade to the bankruptcy court when it permitted the creditors to sue,\n\nand the case was characterized to the jury as just explained.\n\n            While the district court's contrary view is a well-\n\nreasoned position,9 it ultimately must give way on the question of\n\nstanding.   The court's intuition does, though, inform the analysis\n\nlater.\n\n            The Creditors Trustees may properly stand in the shoes of\n\nthe corporation and its shareholders for purposes of the suit\n\nbecause they are continuing the corporation's cause of action, not\n\ninitiating a separate action on behalf of creditors.     See Collier\n\non Bankruptcy ¶ 541.08 (15th ed. rev.) (\"The trustee . . . stands\n\nin the shoes of the debtor corporation in prosecuting a cause of\n\naction belonging to the debtor . . . .\"); id. ¶ 323.01 (\"A trustee\n\nappointed in a chapter 11 case . . . is automatically substituted\n\nas a party in any pending action, proceeding or matter and therefore\n\nhas the same rights and obligations as the . . . debtor in\n\npossession.\").     When a corporation sues its fiduciaries or a\n\n\n     9\n          Frequently, the statute of limitations will bar claims by\ncreditors pursuing actions in the capacity of the corporation when\nthose claims reach back to transactions from years earlier. In\naddition, some claims of this sort may trigger a successful laches\ndefense. But here, the district court correctly determined that\nthe statute of limitations was no bar, and no laches defense was\nraised.\n\n                                 -13-\n\fstockholder brings a derivative suit against corporate fiduciaries\n\nto enforce the corporation's rights, any recovery for the fiduciary\n\nbreach    belongs   to   the   corporation.10   See,   e.g.,   Bessette   v.\n\nBessette, 434 N.E.2d 206, 208 (Mass. 1982) (\"It is a basic principle\n\nof corporate law that if a majority shareholder receives corporate\n\ncash distributions and a salary in excess of the reasonable value\n\nof services rendered, the right to recover the overpayments belongs\n\nto the corporation.\").         Sums recovered by a corporation in such\n\nsuits are paid first to creditors, before any distributions are made\n\nto shareholders.11       See Bagdon v. Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., 916\n\nF.2d 379, 383 (7th Cir. 1990) (\"Recoveries [in derivative suits]\n\npass through the corporate treasury, a process that both protects\n\ncreditors (who get first dibs) and avoids questions of apportionment\n\n. . . .\").    As a result, the issues pretermitted by the district\n\n\n\n     10\n          In some circumstances, the Donahue doctrine permits\nstockholders of close corporations to sue for direct injuries and\nrecover personal relief for breaches of fiduciary duties owed\ndirectly to them. See Donahue v. Rodd Electrotype Co., 328 N.E.2d\n505, 515 (Mass. 1975).     Such a suit for personal relief is\nappropriate where it would be difficult to establish a breach of\nduty owed to the corporation, as in the case of a freeze-out of\nminority shareholders. Id. at 514-15. The Creditors Trustees,\nhowever, do not sue as Donahue plaintiffs.\n     11\n          This result explains why the plaintiff in Bessette\nrefused to assert a derivative rather than a direct claim.\nBessette involved a company on the verge of bankruptcy, and as one\ncommentator explained: \"The plaintiff presumably wanted personal\nrelief because he feared the corporation's creditors, not its\nstockholders, would reap the benefits of any recovery in a\nderivative action.\"    Richard W. Southgate & Donald W. Glazer,\nMassachusetts Corporation Law & Practice § 16.5(b) (2003 Supp.).\n\n                                     -14-\n\fcourt about the validity and enforceability of the release must be\n\nreached.\n\n            In one sense it is quite true that the other shareholders\n\nwere the victims of the unjust enrichment and of any failure to make\n\nadequate disclosure to them in securing the Release, and they are\n\nnot complaining about either.           But to the extent that unjust\n\nenrichment occurred, it was through a misuse of the corporation's\n\nassets; and the Release, although ratified by the shareholders, was\n\na corporate act surrendering a claim of the corporation.             Whatever\n\nright the corporation may have to recover for unjust enrichment,\n\nthrough the invalidation of the Release, is an asset of the\n\ncorporation and now belongs to the creditors.\n\nB.    Standard for Determining the Enforceability of the Release\n\n            In essence, this case involves two claims of fiduciary\n\nbreach.    The first, on which the jury found for the plaintiffs, is\n\nthat the Redeeming Principals had unjustly enriched themselves from\n\nthe corporation's coffers.      The second claim is that the Redeeming\n\nPrincipals committed a fiduciary breach that renders the Release\n\nunenforceable.      The    plaintiffs     argue    that   the   Release    is\n\nunenforceable at a minimum because the defendants failed to disclose\n\nthe   material   details   of   their   unjust    enrichment    to   Mi-Lor's\n\nremaining shareholders and directors when seeking the Release. They\n\nalso argue that the Release is unenforceable because the defendants\n\nhave not demonstrated that the Release was fair to the company.\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\f           At issue, then, is the standard for determining the\n\nenforceability of a release, executed by a close corporation and its\n\ndirectors and shareholders, of claims later proven to a jury that\n\ncertain corporate directors and shareholders unjustly enriched\n\nthemselves   at   the    expense   of   the   corporation.      There   is    no\n\nMassachusetts case directly on point.\n\n           Corporations, whether close or public, have a strong\n\ninterest in being able to give valid and enforceable releases.                A\n\nrelease of claims by a close corporation in particular, even a\n\nrelease of self-dealing claims against its controlling shareholders,\n\nmay benefit the close corporation by allowing it to resolve internal\n\ndisputes in a swift and cost-effective manner and by enabling it to\n\nfacilitate the termination of the involvement of its principals.12\n\nClose corporations like Mi-Lor also present fewer concerns about\n\npossible   injury   to   the   investing      public   from   the   actions   of\n\n\n     12\n          Massachusetts does not prohibit a company from releasing\ndirectors from claims of self-dealing. Massachusetts does prohibit\na corporation from including in its articles of organization a\nprovision that eliminates or limits the liability of a director:\n(1) for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the\ncorporation or its stockholders; (2) for acts or omissions not in\ngood faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing\nviolation of law; (3) for illegal distributions to stockholders and\nimproper loans to directors or officers; or (4) for any\ntransactions from which the director derived an improper personal\nbenefit.    Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 156B, § 13(B)(1.5).          And a\nMassachusetts corporation may not enact a by-law that conflicts\nwith either a statute or its articles of organization. Ch. 156B,\n§ 16; Assessors of Boston v. World Wide Broadcasting Foundation of\nMass., Inc., 59 N.E.2d 188, 191 (Mass. 1945) (noting that by-laws\nmay not enlarge or alter the powers conferred by the articles of\norganization or by statute).\n\n                                    -16-\n\fcorporate directors and shareholders than do public corporations or\n\ncharitable corporations.          And where all of the shareholders (as\n\nopposed to the directors) of a close corporation execute a release\n\nafter having received full disclosure, there are self-evident policy\n\nreasons to enforce such a release.\n\n              Even so, within close corporations there are fiduciary\n\nduties imposed on directors, officers, and, for some purposes,\n\nshareholders, in connection with their respective dealings with, and\n\non behalf of, the close corporation and its shareholders.                 See\n\nDemoulas v. Demoulas Super Mkts., Inc., 677 N.E. 2d 159, 179-80\n\n(Mass. 1997); Donahue v. Rodd Electrotype Co., 328 N.E. 2d 505, 515-\n\n16 (Mass. 1975).       The release transaction involved here was not\n\nentered into by two or more independent business entities, but\n\nrather, was an entirely intra-corporation transaction -- entered\n\ninto   by     the   close     corporation   itself   (acting    through   the\n\nratification of its shareholders) with its own principals.                The\n\nintra-corporation nature of the transaction, the plaintiffs argue,\n\ngave   rise    to   certain    fiduciary    obligations   by   the   Redeeming\n\nPrincipals.\n\n              In Demoulas, the most recent Massachusetts case about\n\nself-dealing, the plaintiff brought a derivative action against the\n\npresident/director/voting trustee of a close corporation and certain\n\naffiliated persons and entities, alleging that the defendants had\n\ndiverted corporate opportunities and engaged in self-dealing.             677\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\fN.E.2d at 165-66.      The Supreme Judicial Court explained that a\n\ncorporate fiduciary is not entirely barred from pursuing a corporate\n\nopportunity or entering into a self-dealing transaction.         When such\n\nactions are taken, though, the corporate fiduciary has a duty to\n\ndisclose the details of the opportunity/transaction to the corporate\n\ndecision-makers   and,    at    least   when    the   decision-makers   are\n\ninterested directors, has the burden of proving that the opportunity\n\nor transaction is fair.        Id. at 180-82.    The court summarized the\n\nstandard as follows:\n\n          In short, to meet a fiduciary's duty of loyalty, a\n          director or officer who wishes to take advantage of a\n          corporate opportunity or engage in self-dealing must\n          first disclose material details of the venture to the\n          corporation, and then either receive the assent of\n          disinterested directors or shareholders, or otherwise\n          prove that the decision is fair to the corporation.\n\nId. at 182.\n\n          It is clear from Demoulas that Massachusetts imposes on\n\ncorporate fiduciaries a duty of full disclosure of material facts\n\nin connection with self-dealing.           Material information about the\n\nself-dealing transaction is needed to make an educated decision\n\nabout whether to allow it, and in the case of a self-dealing\n\nrelease, information about the conduct of the potential recipients\n\nof the release is necessary for deciding whether to grant the\n\nrelease encompassing such conduct. Thus, the Demoulas rule protects\n\ndecision-makers by giving them information.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\f              But Demoulas does not explicitly address the question of\n\nwhether full disclosure to interested shareholders suffices in the\n\ncontext of a release given with unanimous shareholder consent.13\n\nAnd more generally, Demoulas leaves open the question of the effect\n\nof ratification by interested shareholders and the question of what\n\nrole fairness plays when interested shareholders have ratified.\n\n              The law in this area is a tangled web.                  Language from\n\ncases in both the Supreme Judicial Court and in this court could,\n\nif lifted out of context, be taken to mean that a showing of\n\nfairness is always a requirement.                See Winchell v. Plywood Corp.,\n\n85   N.E.2d     313,    316-17   (Mass.    1949)    (requiring    a    self-dealing\n\ncorporate fiduciary to prove full disclosure and fairness to the\n\ncorporation); Boston Children's Heart Foundation, Inc. v. Nadal-\n\nGinard,    73    F.3d    429,    433-34   (1st    Cir.   1996)   (same,    applying\n\nMassachusetts law).        This language in modern opinions, which seems\n\nto invoke a universal requirement of showing fairness, is at odds\n\nwith older cases saying that transactions between corporations and\n\ntheir fiduciaries that are open and informed may be approved by the\n\nexpress \"consent of all the stockholders.\"                Warren v. Para Rubber\n\nShoe Co., 44 N.E. 112, 113 (Mass. 1896) (holding that a corporation\n\n\n      13\n          It is unclear from the quoted language from Demoulas\nwhether the term \"disinterested\" modifies only \"directors\" or\nmodifies both \"directors\" and \"shareholders.\"       That is, can\nshareholders assent only if they are disinterested?       If the\nmodifier applies to both words, then, apparently, interested\nshareholders cannot, even upon full disclosure and unanimous\nagreement, approve self-dealing by corporate fiduciaries.\n\n                                          -19-\n\fcould contract with directors when the contract was made openly and\n\nwith the assent of all the stockholders and the stockholders were\n\nnot ignorant of the terms of the contract or of the self-dealing\n\nrelationship between the contracting parties). Until Massachusetts\n\naddresses these questions directly, we are left to work out the\n\nissue.\n\n          On balance, we conclude the wiser rule is that where there\n\nis unanimous and fully informed shareholder approval in a close\n\ncorporation, such approval suffices (subject to special rules for\n\ninsolvency).    If   there   is   not   full    disclosure   and   unanimous\n\napproval, the question arises whether a showing of fairness alone\n\nwould suffice to validate the Release.         This appears to be the rule\n\nin most jurisdictions, Gevurtz, Corporation Law 324 (2000); yet a\n\nvery literal reading of Demoulas' language quoted above might\n\nsuggest the need for both full disclosure and fairness -- although\n\nthis variation was not decided there.          Quite possibly the question\n\nneed not be answered in the present case (and we do not seek to do\n\nso) because, if the transaction embracing the Release was fair,\n\narguably this means that the corporation has already been properly\n\ncompensated for its unjust enrichment claim.\n\n          The rule we adopt is close to the non-exclusive rule in\n\nthe Delaware   statute14   that   a   self-dealing    transaction    may   be\n\n\n     14\n          It is true that Massachusetts has not always followed\nDelaware law on corporations. Compare Donahue, 328 N.E.2d at 515\n& n.17 (creating a new fiduciary duty of utmost good faith and\n\n                                   -20-\n\fapproved by the consent of all shareholders -- whether interested\n\nor not -- so long as there is disclosure to those shareholders of\n\nall material facts concerning the self-dealing.15    See Del. Code\n\nAnn. tit. 8, § 144(a); R. Clark, Corporate Law 168 (1986).     That\n\nstatutory rule is modified by Delaware case law, but the case law\n\nregarding the effect of the fully informed consent of shareholders\n\nin various contexts16 has been described by the Delaware Chancery\n\n\n\n\nloyalty among the stockholders of Massachusetts close corporations\nthat is more exacting than the duty traditionally owed by corporate\ndirectors and officers), with Nixon v. Blackwell, 626 A.2d 1366,\n1379-81 (Del. 1993) (noting that directors have the same fiduciary\nduties under Delaware law whether or not a corporation is closely\nheld and declining to fashion \"a special judicially-created rule\nfor minority investors\" in close corporations).      Massachusetts'\nindependent view expressed in Donahue does not address how the\nduties imposed on fiduciaries in close corporations might be\naffected where there is unanimous ratification by informed\nshareholders. The applications of fiduciary duties in Donahue and\nin Demoulas do not involve second-guessing the unanimous decision\nof informed shareholders, so neither of those cases reaches as far\nas this case requires.\n     15\n          Under the Delaware statute, a self-dealing transaction\nmay be approved by the consent of a majority of fully-informed and\ndisinterested directors; by the consent of fully-informed\nshareholders; or by a showing that \"the contract or transaction is\nfair to the corporation as of the time it is authorized, approved\nor ratified, by the board of directors, a committee or the\nshareholders.\" Del. Code Ann. tit. 8, § 144(a)(3). Delaware case\nlaw suggests that the approval of a majority of informed\nshareholders is sufficient under the statute, but the cases\ndisagree about whether interested shareholders may be counted\ntowards the majority.\n     16\n          One commentator has noted the weaknesses of relying on\nshareholder approval in public corporations to protect investors'\ninterests. See R. Clark, Corporate Law 180-183 (1986).\n\n                               -21-\n\fCourt as \"not a model of clarity.\"         Solomon v. Armstrong, 747 A.2d\n\n1098, 1113 (Del. Ch. 1999).\n\n           Here, there was unanimous shareholder approval, so the\n\ncase does not present the question of what to do where a majority\n\nof shareholders approve but that majority is controlled by or\n\ncomposed of the defendants.   If fully informed shareholder approval\n\nwere simply by a majority, then different rules and shifting burdens\n\nmight apply, see, e.g., Wachsler, Inc. v. Florafax Int'l, Inc., 778\n\nF.2d 547, 552 (10th Cir. 1985), because then, \"even an informed\n\nshareholder vote may not afford the minority sufficient protection\n\nto obviate the judicial oversight role.\" In re Wheelabrator Techs.,\n\nInc. S'holders Litig., 663 A.2d 1194, 1204 (Del. Ch. 1995).           That\n\nrationale for requiring an additional fairness showing -- the\n\nprotection of dissenting minority shareholders who, perforce, have\n\nbrought a derivative action -- is inapplicable where the fully\n\ninformed   shareholder   owners   of   a    close   corporation,   even   if\n\ninterested, unanimously consent to the giving of a release.\n\n           As a practical matter, many close corporations are family\n\ncorporations and/or do not have any disinterested shareholders or\n\ndisinterested directors.    Because the shareholders are the owners,\n\nif all of the owners, \"interested\" or not, of a close corporation\n\nagree to allow a release of claims of self-dealing after receiving\n\nfull information about it, then they have had the opportunity to\n\nprotect their own interests and there are no dissenting shareholders\n\n\n                                  -22-\n\fwho may need further protection.   It would ordinarily be unwise to\n\ninvolve courts in reviewing the informed and unanimous decisions of\n\nthe owners, absent special circumstances.\n\n          Massachusetts, of course, may choose a different path in\n\nthe future.   It may, for example, feel that creditors of close\n\ncorporations deserve protection against the mutual looting of\n\ncorporate assets by all of a close corporation's shareholders.   The\n\nlaw, however, already provides a degree of such protection.   As the\n\ndistrict court aptly recognized, a corporation may not act to\n\nrelease claims when that action would cause the corporation to go\n\ninto insolvency or would take place during insolvency.     See Mass.\n\nGen. Laws ch. 109A, § 5; In re Tufts Elecs., Inc., 746 F.2d 915, 917\n\n(Mass. App. Ct. 1984) (explaining that \"prejudice [to creditors]\n\narises where the transaction is a fraudulent conveyance or one which\n\nled to corporate insolvency\").\n\n          If there has not been adequate disclosure to the remaining\n\nMi-Lor shareholders, then there may be defenses available such as\n\nlack of causation or lack of damages, the availability or force of\n\nwhich we need not determine.\n\nC.   Burden of Proving the Enforceability of the Release\n\n           The fact of a release is an affirmative defense, and the\n\nparty seeking to have a release enforced usually bears the initial\n\nburden of pleading and proving the existence of that release.    See\n\n\n\n\n                                 -23-\n\fSharon v. City of Newton, 769 N.E.2d 738, 742-43 (Mass. 2002). That\n\nwas done here.\n\n           Once the burden of proving the existence of an executed\n\nrelease has been met, the burden of proving or disproving its\n\nenforceability may lie with either party, depending on the context\n\nin which the release was given.            The defendants argue that the\n\nRelease is a contract and cannot be nullified absent the plaintiff's\n\nproving   \"fraud,     misrepresentation,     mutual    mistake,   breach    of\n\nfiduciary duty, or undue influence\" or \"that at the time the release\n\nwas given the corporation was insolvent or became insolvent as a\n\nresult of the release.\"      The last ground for nullification does not\n\napply on the facts here. As to the other grounds for nullification,\n\nthe burden of proof is generally on the plaintiff in non-fiduciary\n\nduty situations.      See, e.g., Sharon, 769 N.E.2d at 743 n.6.            The\n\ndefendants    argue   that   the   plaintiffs   have   the   burden   on   the\n\nenforceability issue here.\n\n             The defendants' argument ignores the special fiduciary\n\ncontext of the Release:       that the Release goes to a proven breach\n\nof fiduciary duty by a corporate officer/director and shareholders.\n\nAt least where an underlying claim of breach of fiduciary duty has\n\nbeen proven,17 we conclude that Massachusetts would place the burden\n\n\n     17\n          We need not decide who has the burden of showing\nenforceability when there is an unadjudicated claim of an\nunderlying breach of fiduciary duty by the corporate fiduciary. As\na federal court sitting in diversity, we prefer to make narrow\nrulings on issues of state law. See, e.g., V. Suarez & Co., Inc.\n\n                                    -24-\n\fof   showing   the   enforceability   of   a   release   on   the   corporate\n\nfiduciary who relies on that release to extinguish any recovery for\n\nthe underlying breach.     Two doctrines converge to place this burden\n\non the corporate fiduciary.      First, Massachusetts adopts the rule\n\nthat \"[a] release executed in favor of one standing in a fiduciary\n\nrelation to the one executing the release will be subjected to the\n\nclosest scrutiny by the court.\" Allen v. Moushegian, 71 N.E.2d 393,\n\n400 (Mass. 1947) (involving a release issued by a client to her\n\nattorney).     Second, Massachusetts refers to the law of trusts in\n\ncases involving corporate fiduciaries, see, e.g., Demoulas, 677\n\nN.E.2d at 171 (\"Trust law applies . . . to the management of\n\ncorporations.\"), and under trust law, a release of a trustee is\n\n\"subjected to the closest scrutiny,\" Akin v. Warner, 63 N.E.2d 566,\n\n570 (Mass. 1945); Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 217(2).\n\nD.   Application of the Standards to the Mi-Lor Release\n\n             The trial court held in an earlier order, on August 17,\n\n2001, that those who executed the Release were not disinterested.\n\nThe defendants have not argued this issue on appeal, other than\n\nsimply stating in a footnote that \"there was adequate evidence in\n\nthe record to show . . . that the recipients of the release were\n\ndisinterested.\"      The issue is waived.18\n\n\nv. Dow Brands, Inc., 337 F.3d 1, 8-9 (1st Cir. 2003).\n      18\n          Even were it not waived, the ruling is fully supportable.\nA director or officer may be \"interested\" under Massachusetts law\nif she is a party to the transaction; has a business, financial, or\n\n                                   -25-\n\f          Defendants argue that the record establishes that they\n\nmade full disclosure of all material facts about the Release. There\n\nis no formal ruling on this issue, either in the November 20, 2002\n\nmemorandum entering judgment for defendants on the Release or\n\nelsewhere.     Defendants point to the following comment made by the\n\ntrial judge during a colloquy with counsel on April 20, 2001: \"Full\n\ndisclosure as to what?       . . . [T]hey all played the same game.\n\nThere certainly was full disclosure.     Everybody knew that everybody\n\nwas doing 'it,' whatever it is.\"     This comment is far from a ruling\n\nand, in any event, does not foreclose the disclosure issue.\n\n             First, the defendants' argument does not logically follow.\n\nThe fact that Mi-Lor's remaining directors and shareholders also had\n\nexpenses paid by the corporation means that they were most likely\n\nnot disinterested, because they benefitted from a practice of\n\ncorporate largesse.       But it certainly does not mean that the\n\nRedeeming Principals fully disclosed all material details regarding\n\ntheir own self-dealing.\n\n\n\n\nfamilial relationship with a party to the transaction; has a\nmaterial pecuniary interest in the transaction; or is subject to a\ncontrolling influence by a party to the transaction who has a\nmaterial pecuniary interest. Harhen v. Brown, 730 N.E.2d 859, 864\n& n.5 (Mass. 2000) (adopting the definition of \"interested\" stated\nin 1 ALI Principles of Corporate Governance § 1.23 (1994)).       A\nshareholder is \"interested\" if she is a party to the transaction or\nis also an interested director or officer. Id. The directors and\nshareholders who approved the Release had interconnected familial,\nfinancial, and business relationships with parties on both sides of\nthe Release.\n\n                                  -26-\n\f           Second, we cannot say that the record establishes full\n\ndisclosure, thus resolving the issue.       At oral argument, this court\n\nasked defendants' counsel to indicate what evidence was in the\n\nrecord to show that the defendants had made full disclosure.\n\nCounsel replied that Mi-Lor's bookkeeper had testified that he knew\n\nof the details of the unjust enrichment. The bookkeeper's knowledge\n\ndoes not even come close to establishing full disclosure, which must\n\nbe made to the remaining shareholders.\n\n           The plaintiffs, in turn, contend that they are entitled\n\nto judgment because the defendants have the burden of proof and did\n\nnot prove that they made full disclosure of their self-dealing. The\n\nargument is premature.     No one yet has had the benefit of the full\n\nanalysis of this issue from the distinguished judge who sat through\n\nthe trial and has lived with this case for some years. This opinion\n\nclarifies the applicable standards and burdens, and whether to\n\naccept additional evidence on this or any other matter is an issue\n\nfor the trial judge.      The defendants bear the burden on remand of\n\nestablishing full disclosure.\n\n           Plaintiffs also urge us to hold as a matter of law that\n\nthe Release was unfair because there was no consideration given for\n\nit.   They cite cases which they say hold that redemption of stock\n\nnever benefits a corporation.     See In re Roco Corp., 701 F.2d 978\n\n(1st Cir. 1983); In re Main St. Brewing Co., Ltd., 210 B.R. 662\n\n(Bankr.   D.   Mass.   1997).   Those    cases   do   not   stand   for   that\n\n\n                                  -27-\n\fproposition at all.      Instead, Roco essentially says that when a\n\ncorporation is insolvent on the date it redeems shares of its stock,\n\nthe corporation receives nothing of value, 701 F.2d at 982, and Main\n\nSt. Brewing says that stock redemption claims in bankruptcy are\n\nsubordinated to the claims of creditors, 210 B.R. at 664-65.               In\n\nMarch 1990, when Mi-Lor redeemed the stock of the defendants, the\n\ncompany was not insolvent and its stock was not worthless.            And the\n\nequitable subordination issue in Main St. Brewing is not at all\n\nrelevant to the fairness of the Release.            Furthermore, agreements\n\nby   a    corporation   to   purchase   its   own    stock   are    generally\n\nenforceable.    Winchell, 85 N.E.2d at 317.\n\n            There was no finding on fairness by the district judge and\n\nthe record does not, from our reading of it, readily provide an\n\nanswer.    In theory, the Release could have benefitted both parties.\n\nThe corporation, for its part, received stock back, which enhanced\n\nthe value of its remaining shares and which conceivably could have\n\nled to some benefit to it; it also received cooperation and non-\n\ncompete    agreements   from   the    defendants,     a   release   from   the\n\ndefendants of claims against it, and miscellaneous benefits.               In\n\nturn, the corporation paid out $1 million for the redeemed shares\n\nand other consideration and gave up claims that, eleven years later,\n\nled to a judgment of $380,807.66 (exclusive of interest). It is not\n\nclear what the value of the shares was or how to assess the expected\n\nvalue of the unjust enrichment claim at the time the Release was\n\n\n                                     -28-\n\fsigned, given the risks and costs of litigation and other factors.\n\nIn short, it is better to have the trial court determine this matter\n\non remand.       Cf. Lawton v. Nyman, 327 F.3d 30, 51 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n                                          III.\n\n             In their cross-appeal, the defendants argue that their\n\nstatutory     and     constitutional       rights     were   violated     when    the\n\nbankruptcy       court    sua   sponte    granted    summary      judgment   to   the\n\nplaintiffs on the statute of limitations defense in response to the\n\nsame defendants' motion that the bankruptcy court had denied over\n\ntwo months earlier.\n\n             The cross-appeal is close to frivolous.                   The district\n\ncourt reviewed the bankruptcy court's summary judgment ruling de\n\nnovo after both a hearing and the completion of discovery and\n\naffirmed the bankruptcy court's order.               Any deficiency in the sua\n\nsponte nature of the bankruptcy court's decision was cured by the\n\ndistrict court's de novo review.\n\n                                          IV.\n\nConclusion\n\n             The     underlying    sum     involved       here    is   approximately\n\n$380,000, and considerable counsel fees have been spent to this\n\npoint.      We     urge   the   parties    to    settle    this   case   before   the\n\nadditional costs of further proceedings become a reality.\n\n             The decision of the district court that the Release is\n\nvalid and enforceable is reversed; entry of judgment for the\n\n\n                                          -29-\n\fdefendants is vacated; the decision of the district court on the\n\nstatute of limitations is affirmed; and the case is remanded to the\n\ndistrict court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nCosts are awarded to the Creditors Trustees.   So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -30-\n\f",

A jury found that the defendants, an officer/director and the controlling shareholders in two close family corporations, had unjustly enriched themselves from corporate funds in the sum of over $380,000. This appeal concerns whether that liability was extinguished by a release in favor of the defendants that was executed by the corporation and its remaining directors and shareholders on March 31, 1990, as part of mutual releases given in connection with a stock redemption of the defendants' shares. If liability is extinguished, then the plaintiffs, who are creditors in bankruptcy standing in the shoes of the corporation, cannot recover on the jury verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not reach the questions about the validity and enforceability of the release because it ruled that the creditors could not assert such claims &#8212; essentially, that they lacked standing. While that standing analysis has some attraction, it is ultimately unpersuasive. The questions about the release will have to be addressed on remand because this record does not permit their resolution. No Massachusetts case is directly on point as to the standards to be used. This opinion attempts to provide guidance for the case on remand, in an area of law marked by ambiguity and inconsistency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mi-Lor Corporation was in the business of manufacturing, distributing, and selling plastic dental and hair products, such as toothbrushes and combs. The company was formed under Massachusetts law in 1977 by three family groupings &#8212; the Robert Gottsegen family, the Stuart Gottsegen family, and the Lawrence Gottsegen family<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> &#8212; and an individual named Larry Wald. Robert was the president of the company, and he, Stuart, and Wald served as Mi-Lor's directors. Lawrence was primarily responsible for sales; Wald was responsible for Mi-Lor's financial operations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robert's children, Lori and Michael, and Robert's ex-wife, Dorothy, were stockholders of the company, as were Stuart, Lawrence, and Wald.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Two trusts, one for the benefit of Michael and one for the benefit of Lori, also owned Mi-Lor stock. Lawrence was the trustee of both trusts. Although Robert did not own Mi-Lor stock, he effectively controlled the company in his capacity as the sole voting trustee of a voting trust that owned sixty-five percent of Mi-Lor's voting stock. Wald was the only stockholder who was not a member of the voting trust. The voting trust included all of the stock held by Dorothy, Lori, Michael, and the two trusts. To the extent that Robert's interests were aligned with the interests of the other members of his family unit, the Robert Gottsegen group effectively functioned as one unit in three intertwined capacities: as the president, as a director, and as the majority shareholder of Mi-Lor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Professional Brush, Inc. (\"Pro Brush\") was formed in 1987 and was in the business of manufacturing, distributing, and selling toothbrushes and other dental care products. Robert was president and a director of the company; Lawrence, Stuart, and Wald were the other directors. Michael and Lori owned Pro Brush stock, as did Steven Gottsegen, Stuart, and Wald.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1989, Robert suffered a heart attack. On March 31, 1990, pursuant to a stock redemption agreement, Mi-Lor redeemed all of the shares held by Michael, Lori, Dorothy, and the two trusts. As of the same date, the voting trust was terminated, Robert resigned as both president and director, and the management of the corporation changed accordingly.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> As part of the redemption agreement, in exchange for 2,480 shares of stock and for other consideration (including \"consulting, confidentiality and noncompetition\" agreements with Robert and Dorothy, and \"confidentiality and noncompetition\" agreements with Lori and Michael), Mi-Lor assigned to Michael, Lori, Dorothy, and the trustee of the two trusts the proceeds (totaling approximately $1 million) from the merger of Solo Products, Inc. into Mi-Lor and granted them entitlements to receive certain other payments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also on March 31, 1990, Michael and Lori entered into a stock redemption agreement with Pro Brush, whereby Michael and Lori each received twenty-five dollars in exchange for the 625 shares of Pro Brush stock that each held. Pursuant to a provision in this redemption agreement, Robert resigned as president and director of Pro Brush.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As part of the Mi-Lor stock redemption agreement,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Robert, Dorothy, Lori, Michael, and the two trusts (the \"Redeeming Principals\" or the \"Robert Gottsegen group\") also entered into an Agreement of Mutual Release (the \"Release\") with the company and its remaining principals<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> on March 31, 1990. Under its terms, Mi-Lor and its remaining shareholders agreed to release the Redeeming Principals from \"any and all actions, causes of action, damages,... claims or demands of whatever kind or nature ... which the Company and Remaining Principals ever had or claimed to have\" relating to \"any act, omission, cause or thing done or omitted\" with respect to the \"formation, incorporation or operation of the Company....\" The Release excluded claims related to \"the continuing obligations owed by the Redeeming Principals ... under the terms ... of the Redemption Agreement ... and the collateral... agreements\" and claims arising from \"any legal proceeding initiated by Alfred Stauble.\" The Release was signed by all of Mi-Lor's shareholders and all of its directors. It is this release that is at issue here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1994, the Redeeming Principals sued Mi-Lor in state court alleging that they were owed additional payments under the stock redemption agreement based on Mi-Lor's attainment of a specified level of pre-tax earnings. They also alleged fraud on the part of Mi-Lor in the termination of the voting trust. A default judgment was entered against Mi-Lor for $226,984.80, and the voting trust was reinstated. On February 10, 1995, the Redeeming Principals and Mi-Lor entered into a settlement agreement whereby the voting trust was again terminated and Robert was elected a director but agreed not to prevent Mi-Lor from filing for bankruptcy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 3, 1995, Mi-Lor and Pro Brush voluntarily filed Chapter 11 petitions. On February 28, 1997, Mi-Lor and Pro Brush, as debtors-in-possession, brought an adversary proceeding against the Redeeming Principals alleging a host of claims. Among other things, the complaint alleged that the Redeeming Principals had caused Mi-Lor to pay for their personal expenses and make other expenditures for their benefit that had no legitimate corporate purpose.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The defendants' affirmative defenses included the Release and the statute of limitations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 2, 1998, the bankruptcy court confirmed the Second Amended Liquidating Joint Plan of Reorganization of the Debtors. The court's order established that all property of the Mi-Lor and Pro Brush bankruptcy estates would thereafter be vested in the Creditors Trust and that the trustees of the Creditors Trust would succeed to the debtors' right to bring or continue causes of action. Subsequently, James M. Liston and John J. Monaghan, in their capacity as Creditors Trustees, replaced Mi-Lor and Pro Brush as plaintiffs in the corporations' suit against the Redeeming Principals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants moved for summary judgment based on the release and statute of limitations defenses, and the bankruptcy court denied the motion on February 26, 1999. On May 7, 1999, the bankruptcy court <i>sua sponte</i> vacated its February 26 order and granted partial summary judgment to the plaintiffs on the statute of limitations defense. Discovery ensued. The defendants filed a motion to vacate the May 7 order in December 2000, and the district court denied that motion on January 25, 2001 after <i>de novo</i> review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the five day trial in April 2001, the parties disagreed, among other things, about the extent to which the defendants had received personal payments, about whether the defendants had reimbursed the company for the payments of personal expenses they did receive, and about whether the defendants had made loans to the company. There was general agreement, however, that Mi-Lor funds were indeed used to pay the personal expenses of the defendants in the first instance, and that other directors/shareholders in Mi-Lor also received payments of personal expenses. By agreement, the release defense was not submitted to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a special verdict, the jury found that Mi-Lor had paid $380,807.66 of the Redeeming Principals' personal, non-business expenses and that the Redeeming Principals had not reimbursed Mi-Lor for such payments.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Among the allegedly unreimbursed payments shown to have been made to Robert and other members of his family unit were country club dues and expenses; payments to pharmacies for medications; automobile expenses; payments for telephone calls from Robert's home in Bermuda; legal fees for litigation to which Mi-Lor was not a party; payments to Robert's divorce lawyers; monthly payments to Robert's mother; rent payments for an apartment occupied by Michael; and monthly payments to Dorothy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties filed motions for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50 regarding whether the Release should bar the unjust enrichment claim, and the district court scheduled an evidentiary hearing on that issue. The parties then agreed to have the district court decide the issues pertaining to the Release without hearing further evidence, so the district court cancelled the hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's memorandum and order on the parties' respective motions for judgment as a matter of law concluded, against the plaintiffs, that the Release was (1) executed by Mi-Lor, because there was sufficient evidence that Mi-Lor had assented to it, despite its formal shortcomings, and (2) enforceable, because it was executed at a time when no duties were owed to Mi-Lor's creditors. The district court entered judgment in favor of the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Creditors Trustees appeal the district court's decisions to deny their motion for judgment as a matter of law regarding the Release and to allow the defendants' motion for judgment as a matter of law. The defendants' cross-appeal on the statute of limitations ruling argues that their statutory and constitutional rights were violated when the bankruptcy court <i>sua sponte</i> granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs on May 7, 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Creditors Trustees as Plaintiffs</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court construed the question of the validity and enforceability of the Release as an issue of law. It first determined that the Release had been executed by the corporation, even though no signature qua corporation was designated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> It also determined that the broad scope of the Release would cover the unjust enrichment claims, if the Release was deemed valid and enforceable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court then explained that the corporation's shareholders could have brought a derivative action if the unjustly enriched participants had acted to the detriment of the corporation in executing the Release. However, the court held that the plaintiffs here were creditors and could not bring an action challenging the Release unless its execution contributed to the corporation's insolvency or took place while the corporation was insolvent. Because the corporation was not insolvent at the time of the Release and there was no evidence suggesting that the Release contributed to its subsequent insolvency, the court ruled:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While shareholders may have been able to object to the Release, in fact, every shareholder signed it. The fact that Mi-Lor is presently insolvent does not mean that the Release suddenly becomes invalid as a result of duties owed to creditors or to the corporation on behalf of the creditors. Invalidating the Release years after its execution because of its adverse effects on creditors' interests would create fiduciary duties to creditors where they simply do not exist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the court did not reach the questions raised about the validity and enforceability of the Release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the plaintiffs argue that the court applied the wrong analytical principles in choosing to deny creditors the ability to pursue claims as substitute plaintiffs for the corporation. They argue that the company, as debtor-in-possession, properly filed an adversary proceeding against the defendants pursuant to the rules of the federal bankruptcy system. This position is correct. A corporation may bring an action against its directors, current or former, for self-dealing. <i>See Boston Children's Heart Foundation, Inc. v. Nadal-Ginard,</i> 73 F.3d 429 (1st Cir. 1996) (applying Massachusetts law). And a debtor-in-possession may commence an action without court approval. <i>Collier on Bankruptcy</i> &#182; 323.01 (15th ed. rev.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Creditors Trustees then argue that, by order of the bankruptcy court, they properly stepped into the shoes of the corporation as plaintiffs. In those shoes, they are asserting the corporation's right to recover to the estate the amount of the unjust enrichment. That they, as creditors, would be the real beneficiaries of any recovery is, they say, happenstance and does not alter the fact that they sue in the shoes of the company. The defendants do not contest this proposition; indeed, no objection was made to the bankruptcy court when it permitted the creditors to sue, and the case was characterized to the jury as just explained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the district court's contrary view is a well-reasoned position,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> it ultimately must give way on the question of standing. The court's intuition does, though, inform the analysis later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Creditors Trustees may properly stand in the shoes of the corporation and its shareholders for purposes of the suit because they are continuing the corporation's cause of action, not initiating a separate action on behalf of creditors. <i>See Collier on Bankruptcy</i> &#182; 541.08 (15th ed. rev.) (\"The trustee ... stands in the shoes of the debtor corporation in prosecuting a cause of action belonging to the debtor....\"); <i>id.</i> &#182; 323.01 (\"A trustee appointed in a chapter 11 case ... is automatically substituted as a party in any pending action, proceeding or matter and therefore has the same rights and obligations as the ... debtor in possession.\"). When a corporation sues its fiduciaries or a stockholder brings a derivative suit against corporate fiduciaries to enforce the corporation's rights, any recovery for the fiduciary breach belongs to the corporation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> <i>See, e.g., Bessette v. Bessette,</i> 385 Mass. 806, 434 N.E.2d 206, 208 (1982) (\"It is a basic principle of corporate law that if a majority shareholder receives corporate cash distributions and a salary in excess of the reasonable value of services rendered, the right to recover the overpayments belongs to the corporation.\"). Sums recovered by a corporation in such suits are paid first to creditors, before any distributions are made to shareholders.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> <i>See Bagdon v. Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc.,</i> 916 F.2d 379, 383 (7th Cir.1990) (\"Recoveries [in derivative suits] pass through the corporate treasury, a process that both protects creditors (who get first dibs) and avoids questions of apportionment....\"). As a result, the issues pretermitted by the district court about the validity and enforceability of the release must be reached.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In one sense it is quite true that the other shareholders were the victims of the unjust enrichment and of any failure to make adequate disclosure to them in securing the Release, and they are not complaining about either. But to the extent that unjust enrichment occurred, it was through a misuse of the <i>corporation's</i> assets; and the Release, although ratified by the shareholders, was a <i>corporate</i> act surrendering a claim of the corporation. Whatever right the corporation may have to recover for unjust enrichment, through the invalidation of the Release, is an asset of the corporation and now belongs to the creditors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Standard for Determining the Enforceability of the Release</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In essence, this case involves two claims of fiduciary breach. The first, on which the jury found for the plaintiffs, is that the Redeeming Principals had unjustly enriched themselves from the corporation's coffers. The second claim is that the Redeeming Principals committed a fiduciary breach that renders the Release unenforceable. The plaintiffs argue that the Release is unenforceable at a minimum because the defendants failed to disclose the material details of their unjust enrichment to Mi-Lor's remaining shareholders and directors when seeking the Release. They also argue that the Release is unenforceable because the defendants have not demonstrated that the Release was fair to the company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At issue, then, is the standard for determining the enforceability of a release, executed by a close corporation and its directors and shareholders, of claims later proven to a jury that certain corporate directors and shareholders unjustly enriched themselves at the expense of the corporation. There is no Massachusetts case directly on point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Corporations, whether close or public, have a strong interest in being able to give valid and enforceable releases. A release of claims by a close corporation in particular, even a release of self-dealing claims against its controlling shareholders, may benefit the close corporation by allowing it to resolve internal disputes in a swift and cost-effective manner and by enabling it to facilitate the termination of the involvement of its principals.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Close corporations like Mi-Lor also present fewer concerns about possible injury to the investing public from the actions of corporate directors and shareholders than do public corporations or charitable corporations. And where <i>all</i> of the shareholders (as opposed to the directors) of a close corporation execute a release after having received full disclosure, there are self-evident policy reasons to enforce such a release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even so, within close corporations there are fiduciary duties imposed on directors, officers, and, for some purposes, shareholders, in connection with their respective dealings with, and on behalf of, the close corporation and its shareholders. <i>See Demoulas v. Demoulas Super Mkts., Inc.,</i> 424 Mass. 501, 677 N.E.2d 159, 179-80 (1997); <i>Donahue v. Rodd Electrotype Co.,</i> 367 Mass. 578, 328 N.E.2d 505, 515-16 (1975). The release transaction involved here was not entered into by two or more independent business entities, but rather, was an entirely intra-corporation transaction &#8212; entered into by the close corporation itself (acting through the ratification of its shareholders) with its own principals. The intra-corporation nature of the transaction, the plaintiffs argue, gave rise to certain fiduciary obligations by the Redeeming Principals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Demoulas,</i> the most recent Massachusetts case about self-dealing, the plaintiff brought a derivative action against the president/director/voting trustee of a close corporation and certain affiliated persons and entities, alleging that the defendants had diverted corporate opportunities and engaged in self-dealing. 677 N.E.2d at 165-66. The Supreme Judicial Court explained that a corporate fiduciary is not entirely barred from pursuing a corporate opportunity or entering into a self-dealing transaction. When such actions are taken, though, the corporate fiduciary has a duty to disclose the details of the opportunity/transaction to the corporate decision-makers and, at least when the decision-makers are interested directors, has the burden of proving that the opportunity or transaction is fair. <i>Id.</i> at 180-82. The court summarized the standard as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, to meet a fiduciary's duty of loyalty, a director or officer who wishes to take advantage of a corporate opportunity or engage in self-dealing must first disclose material details of the venture to the corporation, and then either receive the assent of disinterested directors or shareholders, or otherwise prove that the decision is fair to the corporation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 182.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear from <i>Demoulas</i> that Massachusetts imposes on corporate fiduciaries a duty of full disclosure of material facts in connection with self-dealing. Material information about the self-dealing transaction is needed to make an educated decision about whether to allow it, and in the case of a self-dealing release, information about the conduct of the potential recipients of the release is necessary for deciding whether to grant the release encompassing such conduct. Thus, the <i>Demoulas</i> rule protects decision-makers by giving them information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But <i>Demoulas</i> does not explicitly address the question of whether full disclosure to <i>interested shareholders</i> suffices in the context of a release given with unanimous shareholder consent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> And more generally, <i>Demoulas</i> leaves open the question of the effect of ratification by interested shareholders and the question of what role fairness plays when interested shareholders have ratified.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The law in this area is a tangled web. Language from cases in both the Supreme Judicial Court and in this court could, if lifted out of context, be taken to mean that a showing of fairness is always a requirement. <i>See Winchell v. Plywood Corp.,</i> 324 Mass. 171, 85 N.E.2d 313, 316-17 (1949) (requiring a self-dealing corporate fiduciary to prove full disclosure <i>and</i> fairness to the corporation); <i>Boston Children's Heart Foundation, Inc. v. Nadal-Ginard,</i> 73 F.3d 429, 433-34 (1st Cir.1996) (same, applying Massachusetts law). This language in modern opinions, which seems to invoke a universal requirement of showing fairness, is at odds with older cases saying that transactions between corporations and their fiduciaries that are open and informed may be approved by the express \"consent of all the stockholders.\" <i>Warren v. Para Rubber Shoe Co.,</i> 166 Mass. 97, 44 N.E. 112, 113 (1896) (holding that a corporation could contract with directors when the contract was made openly and with the assent of all the stockholders and the stockholders were not ignorant of the terms of the contract or of the self-dealing relationship between the contracting parties). Until Massachusetts addresses these questions directly, we are left to work out the issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On balance, we conclude the wiser rule is that where there is unanimous and fully informed shareholder approval in a close corporation, such approval suffices (subject to special rules for insolvency). If there is not full disclosure and unanimous approval, the question arises whether a showing of fairness alone would suffice to validate the Release. This appears to be the rule in most jurisdictions, Gevurtz, <i>Corporation Law</i> 324 (2000); yet a very literal reading of <i>Demoulas'</i> language quoted above might suggest the need for both full disclosure and fairness &#8212; although this variation was not decided there. Quite possibly the question need not be answered in the present case (and we do not seek to do so) because, if the transaction embracing the Release was fair, arguably this means that the corporation has already been properly compensated for its unjust enrichment claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rule we adopt is close to the non-exclusive rule in the Delaware statute<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> that a self-dealing transaction may be approved by the consent of all shareholders &#8212; whether interested or not &#8212; so long as there is disclosure to those shareholders of all material facts concerning the self-dealing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> <i>See</i> Del.Code Ann. tit. 8, &#167; 144(a); R. Clark, <i>Corporate Law</i> 168 (1986). That statutory rule is modified by Delaware case law, but the case law regarding the effect of the fully informed consent of shareholders in various contexts<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> has been described by the Delaware Chancery Court as \"not a model of clarity.\" <i>Solomon v. Armstrong,</i> 747 A.2d 1098, 1113 (Del.Ch.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, there was unanimous shareholder approval, so the case does not present the question of what to do where a majority of shareholders approve but that majority is controlled by or composed of the defendants. If fully informed shareholder approval were simply by a majority, then different rules and shifting burdens might apply, <i>see, e.g., Wachsler, Inc. v. Florafax Int'l, Inc.,</i> 778 F.2d 547, 552 (10th Cir. 1985), because then, \"even an informed shareholder vote may not afford the minority sufficient protection to obviate the judicial oversight role.\" <i>In re Wheelabrator Techs., Inc. S'holders Litig.,</i> 663 A.2d 1194, 1204 (Del.Ch.1995). That rationale for requiring an additional fairness showing &#8212; the protection of dissenting minority shareholders who, perforce, have brought a derivative action &#8212; is inapplicable where the fully informed shareholder owners of a close corporation, even if interested, unanimously consent to the giving of a release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a practical matter, many close corporations are family corporations and/or do not have any disinterested shareholders or disinterested directors. Because the shareholders are the owners, if <i>all</i> of the owners, \"interested\" or not, of a close corporation agree to allow a release of claims of self-dealing after receiving full information about it, then they have had the opportunity to protect their own interests and there are no dissenting shareholders who may need further protection. It would ordinarily be unwise to involve courts in reviewing the informed and unanimous decisions of the owners, absent special circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts, of course, may choose a different path in the future. It may, for example, feel that creditors of close corporations deserve protection against the mutual looting of corporate assets by all of a close corporation's shareholders. The law, however, already provides a degree of such protection. As the district court aptly recognized, a corporation may not act to release claims when that action would cause the corporation to go into insolvency or would take place during insolvency. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 109A, &#167; 5; <i>In re Tufts Elecs., Inc.,</i> 746 F.2d 915, 917 (Mass.App.Ct.1984) (explaining that \"prejudice [to creditors] arises where the transaction is a fraudulent conveyance or one which led to corporate insolvency\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If there has not been adequate disclosure to the remaining Mi-Lor shareholders, then there may be defenses available such as lack of causation or lack of damages, the availability or force of which we need not determine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Burden of Proving the Enforceability of the Release</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact of a release is an affirmative defense, and the party seeking to have a release enforced usually bears the initial burden of pleading and proving the existence of that release. <i>See Sharon v. City of Newton,</i> 437 Mass. 99, 769 N.E.2d 738, 742-43 (2002). That was done here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the burden of proving the existence of an executed release has been met, the burden of proving or disproving its enforceability may lie with either party, depending on the context in which the release was given. The defendants argue that the Release is a contract and cannot be nullified absent the plaintiff's proving \"fraud, misrepresentation, mutual mistake, breach of fiduciary duty, or undue influence\" or \"that at the time the release was given the corporation was insolvent or became insolvent as a result of the release.\" The last ground for nullification does not apply on the facts here. As to the other grounds for nullification, the burden of proof is generally on the plaintiff in non-fiduciary duty situations. <i>See, e.g., Sharon,</i> 769 N.E.2d at 743 n. 6. The defendants argue that the plaintiffs have the burden on the enforceability issue here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants' argument ignores the special fiduciary context of the Release: that the Release goes to a proven breach of fiduciary duty by a corporate officer/director and shareholders. At least where an underlying claim of breach of fiduciary duty has been proven,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> we conclude that Massachusetts would place the burden of showing the enforceability of a release on the corporate fiduciary who relies on that release to extinguish any recovery for the underlying breach. Two doctrines converge to place this burden on the corporate fiduciary. First, Massachusetts adopts the rule that \"[a] release executed in favor of one standing in a fiduciary relation to the one executing the release will be subjected to the closest scrutiny by the court.\" <i>Allen v. Moushegian,</i> 320 Mass. 746, 71 N.E.2d 393, 400 (1947) (involving a release issued by a client to her attorney). Second, Massachusetts refers to the law of trusts in cases involving corporate fiduciaries, <i>see, e.g., Demoulas,</i> 677 N.E.2d at 171 (\"Trust law applies ... to the management of corporations.\"), and under trust law, a release of a trustee is \"subjected to the closest scrutiny,\" <i>Akin v. Warner,</i> 318 Mass. 669, 63 N.E.2d 566, 570 (1945); Restatement (Second) of Trusts &#167; 217(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D. Application of the Standards to the Mi-Lor Release</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court held in an earlier order, on August 17, 2001, that those who executed the Release were not disinterested. The defendants have not argued this issue on appeal, other than simply stating in a footnote that \"there <i>was</i> adequate evidence in the record to show ... that the recipients of the release were disinterested.\" The issue is waived.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that the record establishes that they made full disclosure of all material facts about the Release. There is no formal ruling on this issue, either in the November 20, 2002 memorandum entering judgment for defendants on the Release or elsewhere. Defendants point to the following comment made by the trial judge during a colloquy with counsel on April 20, 2001: \"Full disclosure as to what? ... [T]hey all played the same game. There certainly was full disclosure. Everybody knew that everybody was doing `it,' whatever it is.\" This comment is far from a ruling and, in any event, does not foreclose the disclosure issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the defendants' argument does not logically follow. The fact that Mi-Lor's remaining directors and shareholders also had expenses paid by the corporation means that they were most likely not disinterested, because they benefitted from a practice of corporate largesse. But it certainly does not mean that the Redeeming Principals fully disclosed all material details regarding their own self-dealing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, we cannot say that the record establishes full disclosure, thus resolving the issue. At oral argument, this court asked defendants' counsel to indicate what evidence was in the record to show that the defendants had made full disclosure. Counsel replied that Mi-Lor's bookkeeper had testified that he knew of the details of the unjust enrichment. The bookkeeper's knowledge does not even come close to establishing full disclosure, which must be made to the remaining shareholders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs, in turn, contend that they are entitled to judgment because the defendants have the burden of proof and did not prove that they made full disclosure of their self-dealing. The argument is premature. No one yet has had the benefit of the full analysis of this issue from the distinguished judge who sat through the trial and has lived with this case for some years. This opinion clarifies the applicable standards and burdens, and whether to accept additional evidence on this or any other matter is an issue for the trial judge. The defendants bear the burden on remand of establishing full disclosure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs also urge us to hold as a matter of law that the Release was unfair because there was no consideration given for it. They cite cases which they say hold that redemption of stock never benefits a corporation. <i>See In re Roco Corp.,</i> 701 F.2d 978 (1st Cir.1983); <i>In re Main St. Brewing Co., Ltd.,</i> 210 B.R. 662 (Bankr. D.Mass.1997). Those cases do not stand for that proposition at all. Instead, Roco essentially says that when a corporation is insolvent on the date it redeems shares of its stock, the corporation receives nothing of value, 701 F.2d at 982, and <i>Main St. Brewing</i> says that stock redemption claims in bankruptcy are subordinated to the claims of creditors, 210 B.R. at 664-65. In March 1990, when Mi-Lor redeemed the stock of the defendants, the company was not insolvent and its stock was not worthless. And the equitable subordination issue in <i>Main St. Brewing</i> is not at all relevant to the fairness of the Release. Furthermore, agreements by a corporation to purchase its own stock are generally enforceable. <i>Winchell,</i> 85 N.E.2d at 317.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was no finding on fairness by the district judge and the record does not, from our reading of it, readily provide an answer. In theory, the Release could have benefitted both parties. The corporation, for its part, received stock back, which enhanced the value of its remaining shares and which conceivably could have led to some benefit to it; it also received cooperation and non-compete agreements from the defendants, a release from the defendants of claims against it, and miscellaneous benefits. In turn, the corporation paid out $1 million for the redeemed shares and other consideration and gave up claims that, eleven years later, led to a judgment of $380,807.66 (exclusive of interest). It is not clear what the value of the shares was or how to assess the expected value of the unjust enrichment claim at the time the Release was signed, given the risks and costs of litigation and other factors. In short, it is better to have the trial court determine this matter on remand. <i>Cf. Lawton v. Nyman,</i> 327 F.3d 30, 51 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their cross-appeal, the defendants argue that their statutory and constitutional rights were violated when the bankruptcy court <i>sua sponte</i> granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs on the statute of limitations defense in response to the same defendants' motion that the bankruptcy court had denied over two months earlier.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cross-appeal is close to frivolous. The district court reviewed the bankruptcy court's summary judgment ruling <i>de novo</i> after both a hearing and the completion of discovery and affirmed the bankruptcy court's order. Any deficiency in the <i>sua sponte</i> nature of the bankruptcy court's decision was cured by the district court's <i>de novo</i> review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The underlying sum involved here is approximately $380,000, and considerable counsel fees have been spent to this point.

A jury found that the defendants, an officer/director and the controlling shareholders in two close family corporations, had unjustly enriched themselves from corporate funds in the sum of over $380,000. This appeal concerns whether that liability was extinguished by a release in favor of the defendants that was executed by the corporation and its remaining directors and shareholders on March 31, 1990, as part of mutual releases given in connection with a stock redemption of the defendants' shares. If liability is extinguished, then the plaintiffs, who are creditors in bankruptcy standing in the shoes of the corporation, cannot recover on the jury verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not reach the questions about the validity and enforceability of the release because it ruled that the creditors could not assert such claims &#8212; essentially, that they lacked standing. While that standing analysis has some attraction, it is ultimately unpersuasive. The questions about the release will have to be addressed on remand because this record does not permit their resolution. No Massachusetts case is directly on point as to the standards to be used. This opinion attempts to provide guidance for the case on remand, in an area of law marked by ambiguity and inconsistency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mi-Lor Corporation was in the business of manufacturing, distributing, and selling plastic dental and hair products, such as toothbrushes and combs. The company was formed under Massachusetts law in 1977 by three family groupings &#8212; the Robert Gottsegen family, the Stuart Gottsegen family, and the Lawrence Gottsegen family<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> &#8212; and an individual named Larry Wald. Robert was the president of the company, and he, Stuart, and Wald served as Mi-Lor's directors. Lawrence was primarily responsible for sales; Wald was responsible for Mi-Lor's financial operations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robert's children, Lori and Michael, and Robert's ex-wife, Dorothy, were stockholders of the company, as were Stuart, Lawrence, and Wald.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Two trusts, one for the benefit of Michael and one for the benefit of Lori, also owned Mi-Lor stock. Lawrence was the trustee of both trusts. Although Robert did not own Mi-Lor stock, he effectively controlled the company in his capacity as the sole voting trustee of a voting trust that owned sixty-five percent of Mi-Lor's voting stock. Wald was the only stockholder who was not a member of the voting trust. The voting trust included all of the stock held by Dorothy, Lori, Michael, and the two trusts. To the extent that Robert's interests were aligned with the interests of the other members of his family unit, the Robert Gottsegen group effectively functioned as one unit in three intertwined capacities: as the president, as a director, and as the majority shareholder of Mi-Lor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Professional Brush, Inc. (\"Pro Brush\") was formed in 1987 and was in the business of manufacturing, distributing, and selling toothbrushes and other dental care products. Robert was president and a director of the company; Lawrence, Stuart, and Wald were the other directors. Michael and Lori owned Pro Brush stock, as did Steven Gottsegen, Stuart, and Wald.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1989, Robert suffered a heart attack. On March 31, 1990, pursuant to a stock redemption agreement, Mi-Lor redeemed all of the shares held by Michael, Lori, Dorothy, and the two trusts. As of the same date, the voting trust was terminated, Robert resigned as both president and director, and the management of the corporation changed accordingly.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> As part of the redemption agreement, in exchange for 2,480 shares of stock and for other consideration (including \"consulting, confidentiality and noncompetition\" agreements with Robert and Dorothy, and \"confidentiality and noncompetition\" agreements with Lori and Michael), Mi-Lor assigned to Michael, Lori, Dorothy, and the trustee of the two trusts the proceeds (totaling approximately $1 million) from the merger of Solo Products, Inc. into Mi-Lor and granted them entitlements to receive certain other payments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also on March 31, 1990, Michael and Lori entered into a stock redemption agreement with Pro Brush, whereby Michael and Lori each received twenty-five dollars in exchange for the 625 shares of Pro Brush stock that each held. Pursuant to a provision in this redemption agreement, Robert resigned as president and director of Pro Brush.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As part of the Mi-Lor stock redemption agreement,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Robert, Dorothy, Lori, Michael, and the two trusts (the \"Redeeming Principals\" or the \"Robert Gottsegen group\") also entered into an Agreement of Mutual Release (the \"Release\") with the company and its remaining principals<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> on March 31, 1990. Under its terms, Mi-Lor and its remaining shareholders agreed to release the Redeeming Principals from \"any and all actions, causes of action, damages,... claims or demands of whatever kind or nature ... which the Company and Remaining Principals ever had or claimed to have\" relating to \"any act, omission, cause or thing done or omitted\" with respect to the \"formation, incorporation or operation of the Company....\" The Release excluded claims related to \"the continuing obligations owed by the Redeeming Principals ... under the terms ... of the Redemption Agreement ... and the collateral... agreements\" and claims arising from \"any legal proceeding initiated by Alfred Stauble.\" The Release was signed by all of Mi-Lor's shareholders and all of its directors. It is this release that is at issue here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1994, the Redeeming Principals sued Mi-Lor in state court alleging that they were owed additional payments under the stock redemption agreement based on Mi-Lor's attainment of a specified level of pre-tax earnings. They also alleged fraud on the part of Mi-Lor in the termination of the voting trust. A default judgment was entered against Mi-Lor for $226,984.80, and the voting trust was reinstated. On February 10, 1995, the Redeeming Principals and Mi-Lor entered into a settlement agreement whereby the voting trust was again terminated and Robert was elected a director but agreed not to prevent Mi-Lor from filing for bankruptcy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 3, 1995, Mi-Lor and Pro Brush voluntarily filed Chapter 11 petitions. On February 28, 1997, Mi-Lor and Pro Brush, as debtors-in-possession, brought an adversary proceeding against the Redeeming Principals alleging a host of claims. Among other things, the complaint alleged that the Redeeming Principals had caused Mi-Lor to pay for their personal expenses and make other expenditures for their benefit that had no legitimate corporate purpose.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The defendants' affirmative defenses included the Release and the statute of limitations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 2, 1998, the bankruptcy court confirmed the Second Amended Liquidating Joint Plan of Reorganization of the Debtors. The court's order established that all property of the Mi-Lor and Pro Brush bankruptcy estates would thereafter be vested in the Creditors Trust and that the trustees of the Creditors Trust would succeed to the debtors' right to bring or continue causes of action. Subsequently, James M. Liston and John J. Monaghan, in their capacity as Creditors Trustees, replaced Mi-Lor and Pro Brush as plaintiffs in the corporations' suit against the Redeeming Principals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants moved for summary judgment based on the release and statute of limitations defenses, and the bankruptcy court denied the motion on February 26, 1999. On May 7, 1999, the bankruptcy court <i>sua sponte</i> vacated its February 26 order and granted partial summary judgment to the plaintiffs on the statute of limitations defense. Discovery ensued. The defendants filed a motion to vacate the May 7 order in December 2000, and the district court denied that motion on January 25, 2001 after <i>de novo</i> review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the five day trial in April 2001, the parties disagreed, among other things, about the extent to which the defendants had received personal payments, about whether the defendants had reimbursed the company for the payments of personal expenses they did receive, and about whether the defendants had made loans to the company. There was general agreement, however, that Mi-Lor funds were indeed used to pay the personal expenses of the defendants in the first instance, and that other directors/shareholders in Mi-Lor also received payments of personal expenses. By agreement, the release defense was not submitted to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a special verdict, the jury found that Mi-Lor had paid $380,807.66 of the Redeeming Principals' personal, non-business expenses and that the Redeeming Principals had not reimbursed Mi-Lor for such payments.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Among the allegedly unreimbursed payments shown to have been made to Robert and other members of his family unit were country club dues and expenses; payments to pharmacies for medications; automobile expenses; payments for telephone calls from Robert's home in Bermuda; legal fees for litigation to which Mi-Lor was not a party; payments to Robert's divorce lawyers; monthly payments to Robert's mother; rent payments for an apartment occupied by Michael; and monthly payments to Dorothy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties filed motions for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50 regarding whether the Release should bar the unjust enrichment claim, and the district court scheduled an evidentiary hearing on that issue. The parties then agreed to have the district court decide the issues pertaining to the Release without hearing further evidence, so the district court cancelled the hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's memorandum and order on the parties' respective motions for judgment as a matter of law concluded, against the plaintiffs, that the Release was (1) executed by Mi-Lor, because there was sufficient evidence that Mi-Lor had assented to it, despite its formal shortcomings, and (2) enforceable, because it was executed at a time when no duties were owed to Mi-Lor's creditors. The district court entered judgment in favor of the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Creditors Trustees appeal the district court's decisions to deny their motion for judgment as a matter of law regarding the Release and to allow the defendants' motion for judgment as a matter of law. The defendants' cross-appeal on the statute of limitations ruling argues that their statutory and constitutional rights were violated when the bankruptcy court <i>sua sponte</i> granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs on May 7, 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Creditors Trustees as Plaintiffs</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court construed the question of the validity and enforceability of the Release as an issue of law. It first determined that the Release had been executed by the corporation, even though no signature qua corporation was designated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> It also determined that the broad scope of the Release would cover the unjust enrichment claims, if the Release was deemed valid and enforceable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court then explained that the corporation's shareholders could have brought a derivative action if the unjustly enriched participants had acted to the detriment of the corporation in executing the Release. However, the court held that the plaintiffs here were creditors and could not bring an action challenging the Release unless its execution contributed to the corporation's insolvency or took place while the corporation was insolvent. Because the corporation was not insolvent at the time of the Release and there was no evidence suggesting that the Release contributed to its subsequent insolvency, the court ruled:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While shareholders may have been able to object to the Release, in fact, every shareholder signed it. The fact that Mi-Lor is presently insolvent does not mean that the Release suddenly becomes invalid as a result of duties owed to creditors or to the corporation on behalf of the creditors. Invalidating the Release years after its execution because of its adverse effects on creditors' interests would create fiduciary duties to creditors where they simply do not exist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the court did not reach the questions raised about the validity and enforceability of the Release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the plaintiffs argue that the court applied the wrong analytical principles in choosing to deny creditors the ability to pursue claims as substitute plaintiffs for the corporation. They argue that the company, as debtor-in-possession, properly filed an adversary proceeding against the defendants pursuant to the rules of the federal bankruptcy system. This position is correct. A corporation may bring an action against its directors, current or former, for self-dealing. <i>See Boston Children's Heart Foundation, Inc. v. Nadal-Ginard,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196516\"><a href=\"/opinion/196516/boston-childrens-v-nadal-ginard/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">429</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1996) (applying Massachusetts law). And a debtor-in-possession may commence an action without court approval. <i>Collier on Bankruptcy</i> &#182; 323.01 (15th ed. rev.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Creditors Trustees then argue that, by order of the bankruptcy court, they properly stepped into the shoes of the corporation as plaintiffs. In those shoes, they are asserting the corporation's right to recover to the estate the amount of the unjust enrichment. That they, as creditors, would be the real beneficiaries of any recovery is, they say, happenstance and does not alter the fact that they sue in the shoes of the company. The defendants do not contest this proposition; indeed, no objection was made to the bankruptcy court when it permitted the creditors to sue, and the case was characterized to the jury as just explained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the district court's contrary view is a well-reasoned position,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> it ultimately must give way on the question of standing. The court's intuition does, though, inform the analysis later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Creditors Trustees may properly stand in the shoes of the corporation and its shareholders for purposes of the suit because they are continuing the corporation's cause of action, not initiating a separate action on behalf of creditors. <i>See Collier on Bankruptcy</i> &#182; 541.08 (15th ed. rev.) (\"The trustee ... stands in the shoes of the debtor corporation in prosecuting a cause of action belonging to the debtor....\"); <i>id.</i> &#182; 323.01 (\"A trustee appointed in a chapter 11 case ... is automatically substituted as a party in any pending action, proceeding or matter and therefore has the same rights and obligations as the ... debtor in possession.\"). When a corporation sues its fiduciaries or a stockholder brings a derivative suit against corporate fiduciaries to enforce the corporation's rights, any recovery for the fiduciary breach belongs to the corporation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> <i>See, e.g., Bessette v.

As a result, the issues pretermitted by the district court about the validity and enforceability of the release must be reached.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In one sense it is quite true that the other shareholders were the victims of the unjust enrichment and of any failure to make adequate disclosure to them in securing the Release, and they are not complaining about either. But to the extent that unjust enrichment occurred, it was through a misuse of the <i>corporation's</i> assets; and the Release, although ratified by the shareholders, was a <i>corporate</i> act surrendering a claim of the corporation. Whatever right the corporation may have to recover for unjust enrichment, through the invalidation of the Release, is an asset of the corporation and now belongs to the creditors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Standard for Determining the Enforceability of the Release</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In essence, this case involves two claims of fiduciary breach. The first, on which the jury found for the plaintiffs, is that the Redeeming Principals had unjustly enriched themselves from the corporation's coffers. The second claim is that the Redeeming Principals committed a fiduciary breach that renders the Release unenforceable. The plaintiffs argue that the Release is unenforceable at a minimum because the defendants failed to disclose the material details of their unjust enrichment to Mi-Lor's remaining shareholders and directors when seeking the Release. They also argue that the Release is unenforceable because the defendants have not demonstrated that the Release was fair to the company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At issue, then, is the standard for determining the enforceability of a release, executed by a close corporation and its directors and shareholders, of claims later proven to a jury that certain corporate directors and shareholders unjustly enriched themselves at the expense of the corporation. There is no Massachusetts case directly on point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Corporations, whether close or public, have a strong interest in being able to give valid and enforceable releases. A release of claims by a close corporation in particular, even a release of self-dealing claims against its controlling shareholders, may benefit the close corporation by allowing it to resolve internal disputes in a swift and cost-effective manner and by enabling it to facilitate the termination of the involvement of its principals.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Close corporations like Mi-Lor also present fewer concerns about possible injury to the investing public from the actions of corporate directors and shareholders than do public corporations or charitable corporations. And where <i>all</i> of the shareholders (as opposed to the directors) of a close corporation execute a release after having received full disclosure, there are self-evident policy reasons to enforce such a release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even so, within close corporations there are fiduciary duties imposed on directors, officers, and, for some purposes, shareholders, in connection with their respective dealings with, and on behalf of, the close corporation and its shareholders. <i>See Demoulas v.

The release transaction involved here was not entered into by two or more independent business entities, but rather, was an entirely intra-corporation transaction &#8212; entered into by the close corporation itself (acting through the ratification of its shareholders) with its own principals. The intra-corporation nature of the transaction, the plaintiffs argue, gave rise to certain fiduciary obligations by the Redeeming Principals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Demoulas,</i> the most recent Massachusetts case about self-dealing, the plaintiff brought a derivative action against the president/director/voting trustee of a close corporation and certain affiliated persons and entities, alleging that the defendants had diverted corporate opportunities and engaged in self-dealing. 677 N.E.2d at 165-66. The Supreme Judicial Court explained that a corporate fiduciary is not entirely barred from pursuing a corporate opportunity or entering into a self-dealing transaction. When such actions are taken, though, the corporate fiduciary has a duty to disclose the details of the opportunity/transaction to the corporate decision-makers and, at least when the decision-makers are interested directors, has the burden of proving that the opportunity or transaction is fair. <i>Id.</i> at 180-82. The court summarized the standard as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, to meet a fiduciary's duty of loyalty, a director or officer who wishes to take advantage of a corporate opportunity or engage in self-dealing must first disclose material details of the venture to the corporation, and then either receive the assent of disinterested directors or shareholders, or otherwise prove that the decision is fair to the corporation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 182.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear from <i>Demoulas</i> that Massachusetts imposes on corporate fiduciaries a duty of full disclosure of material facts in connection with self-dealing. Material information about the self-dealing transaction is needed to make an educated decision about whether to allow it, and in the case of a self-dealing release, information about the conduct of the potential recipients of the release is necessary for deciding whether to grant the release encompassing such conduct. Thus, the <i>Demoulas</i> rule protects decision-makers by giving them information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But <i>Demoulas</i> does not explicitly address the question of whether full disclosure to <i>interested shareholders</i> suffices in the context of a release given with unanimous shareholder consent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> And more generally, <i>Demoulas</i> leaves open the question of the effect of ratification by interested shareholders and the question of what role fairness plays when interested shareholders have ratified.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The law in this area is a tangled web. Language from cases in both the Supreme Judicial Court and in this court could, if lifted out of context, be taken to mean that a showing of fairness is always a requirement. <i>See Winchell v. Plywood Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">324</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">171</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">313</span></span>, 316-17 (1949) (requiring a self-dealing corporate fiduciary to prove full disclosure <i>and</i> fairness to the corporation); <i>Boston Children's Heart Foundation, Inc. v.

This language in modern opinions, which seems to invoke a universal requirement of showing fairness, is at odds with older cases saying that transactions between corporations and their fiduciaries that are open and informed may be approved by the express \"consent of all the stockholders.\" <i>Warren v. Para Rubber Shoe Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">166</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">112</span></span>, 113 (1896) (holding that a corporation could contract with directors when the contract was made openly and with the assent of all the stockholders and the stockholders were not ignorant of the terms of the contract or of the self-dealing relationship between the contracting parties). Until Massachusetts addresses these questions directly, we are left to work out the issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On balance, we conclude the wiser rule is that where there is unanimous and fully informed shareholder approval in a close corporation, such approval suffices (subject to special rules for insolvency). If there is not full disclosure and unanimous approval, the question arises whether a showing of fairness alone would suffice to validate the Release. This appears to be the rule in most jurisdictions, Gevurtz, <i>Corporation Law</i> 324 (2000); yet a very literal reading of <i>Demoulas'</i> language quoted above might suggest the need for both full disclosure and fairness &#8212; although this variation was not decided there. Quite possibly the question need not be answered in the present case (and we do not seek to do so) because, if the transaction embracing the Release was fair, arguably this means that the corporation has already been properly compensated for its unjust enrichment claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rule we adopt is close to the non-exclusive rule in the Delaware statute<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> that a self-dealing transaction may be approved by the consent of all shareholders &#8212; whether interested or not &#8212; so long as there is disclosure to those shareholders of all material facts concerning the self-dealing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> <i>See</i> Del.Code Ann. tit. 8, &#167; 144(a); R. Clark, <i>Corporate Law</i> 168 (1986). That statutory rule is modified by Delaware case law, but the case law regarding the effect of the fully informed consent of shareholders in various contexts<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> has been described by the Delaware Chancery Court as \"not a model of clarity.\" <i>Solomon v.

If fully informed shareholder approval were simply by a majority, then different rules and shifting burdens might apply, <i>see, e.g., Wachsler, Inc. v. Florafax Int'l, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"461420\"><a href=\"/opinion/461420/robert-a-wachsler-inc-a-connecticut-corporation-v-florafax/\"><span class=\"volume\">778</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></a></span>, 552 (10th Cir. 1985), because then, \"even an informed shareholder vote may not afford the minority sufficient protection to obviate the judicial oversight role.\" <i>In re Wheelabrator Techs., Inc. S'holders Litig.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1497632\"><a href=\"/opinion/1497632/in-re-wheelabrator-tech-shareholders-lit/\"><span class=\"volume\">663</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1194</span></a></span>, 1204 (Del.Ch.1995). That rationale for requiring an additional fairness showing &#8212; the protection of dissenting minority shareholders who, perforce, have brought a derivative action &#8212; is inapplicable where the fully informed shareholder owners of a close corporation, even if interested, unanimously consent to the giving of a release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a practical matter, many close corporations are family corporations and/or do not have any disinterested shareholders or disinterested directors. Because the shareholders are the owners, if <i>all</i> of the owners, \"interested\" or not, of a close corporation agree to allow a release of claims of self-dealing after receiving full information about it, then they have had the opportunity to protect their own interests and there are no dissenting shareholders who may need further protection. It would ordinarily be unwise to involve courts in reviewing the informed and unanimous decisions of the owners, absent special circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts, of course, may choose a different path in the future. It may, for example, feel that creditors of close corporations deserve protection against the mutual looting of corporate assets by all of a close corporation's shareholders. The law, however, already provides a degree of such protection. As the district court aptly recognized, a corporation may not act to release claims when that action would cause the corporation to go into insolvency or would take place during insolvency. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 109A, &#167; 5; <i>In re Tufts Elecs., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"443208\"><a href=\"/opinion/443208/in-re-tufts-electronics-inc-tufts-radio-electronics-inc-debtor/\"><span class=\"volume\">746</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">915</span></a></span>, 917 (Mass.App.Ct.1984) (explaining that \"prejudice [to creditors] arises where the transaction is a fraudulent conveyance or one which led to corporate insolvency\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If there has not been adequate disclosure to the remaining Mi-Lor shareholders, then there may be defenses available such as lack of causation or lack of damages, the availability or force of which we need not determine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Burden of Proving the Enforceability of the Release</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact of a release is an affirmative defense, and the party seeking to have a release enforced usually bears the initial burden of pleading and proving the existence of that release. <i>See Sharon v. City of Newton,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">437</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">99</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">769</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></span>, 742-43 (2002). That was done here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the burden of proving the existence of an executed release has been met, the burden of proving or disproving its enforceability may lie with either party, depending on the context in which the release was given. The defendants argue that the Release is a contract and cannot be nullified absent the plaintiff's proving \"fraud, misrepresentation, mutual mistake, breach of fiduciary duty, or undue influence\" or \"that at the time the release was given the corporation was insolvent or became insolvent as a result of the release.\" The last ground for nullification does not apply on the facts here. As to the other grounds for nullification, the burden of proof is generally on the plaintiff in non-fiduciary duty situations. <i>See, e.g., Sharon,</i> 769 N.E.2d at 743 n. 6. The defendants argue that the plaintiffs have the burden on the enforceability issue here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants' argument ignores the special fiduciary context of the Release: that the Release goes to a proven breach of fiduciary duty by a corporate officer/director and shareholders. At least where an underlying claim of breach of fiduciary duty has been proven,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> we conclude that Massachusetts would place the burden of showing the enforceability of a release on the corporate fiduciary who relies on that release to extinguish any recovery for the underlying breach. Two doctrines converge to place this burden on the corporate fiduciary. First, Massachusetts adopts the rule that \"[a] release executed in favor of one standing in a fiduciary relation to the one executing the release will be subjected to the closest scrutiny by the court.\" <i>Allen v. Moushegian,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">320</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">746</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">393</span></span>, 400 (1947) (involving a release issued by a client to her attorney). Second, Massachusetts refers to the law of trusts in cases involving corporate fiduciaries, <i>see, e.g., Demoulas,</i> 677 N.E.2d at 171 (\"Trust law applies ... to the management of corporations.\"), and under trust law, a release of a trustee is \"subjected to the closest scrutiny,\" <i>Akin v. Warner,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">669</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">566</span></span>, 570 (1945); Restatement (Second) of Trusts &#167; 217(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D. Application of the Standards to the Mi-Lor Release</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court held in an earlier order, on August 17, 2001, that those who executed the Release were not disinterested. The defendants have not argued this issue on appeal, other than simply stating in a footnote that \"there <i>was</i> adequate evidence in the record to show ... that the recipients of the release were disinterested.\" The issue is waived.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that the record establishes that they made full disclosure of all material facts about the Release. There is no formal ruling on this issue, either in the November 20, 2002 memorandum entering judgment for defendants on the Release or elsewhere. Defendants point to the following comment made by the trial judge during a colloquy with counsel on April 20, 2001: \"Full disclosure as to what? ... [T]hey all played the same game. There certainly was full disclosure. Everybody knew that everybody was doing `it,' whatever it is.\" This comment is far from a ruling and, in any event, does not foreclose the disclosure issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the defendants' argument does not logically follow. The fact that Mi-Lor's remaining directors and shareholders also had expenses paid by the corporation means that they were most likely not disinterested, because they benefitted from a practice of corporate largesse. But it certainly does not mean that the Redeeming Principals fully disclosed all material details regarding their own self-dealing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, we cannot say that the record establishes full disclosure, thus resolving the issue. At oral argument, this court asked defendants' counsel to indicate what evidence was in the record to show that the defendants had made full disclosure. Counsel replied that Mi-Lor's bookkeeper had testified that he knew of the details of the unjust enrichment. The bookkeeper's knowledge does not even come close to establishing full disclosure, which must be made to the remaining shareholders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs, in turn, contend that they are entitled to judgment because the defendants have the burden of proof and did not prove that they made full disclosure of their self-dealing. The argument is premature. No one yet has had the benefit of the full analysis of this issue from the distinguished judge who sat through the trial and has lived with this case for some years. This opinion clarifies the applicable standards and burdens, and whether to accept additional evidence on this or any other matter is an issue for the trial judge. The defendants bear the burden on remand of establishing full disclosure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs also urge us to hold as a matter of law that the Release was unfair because there was no consideration given for it. They cite cases which they say hold that redemption of stock never benefits a corporation. <i>See In re Roco Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"415363\"><a href=\"/opinion/415363/in-re-roco-corporation-dba-standard-supply-company-debtor-edward/\"><span class=\"volume\">701</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">978</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1983); <i>In re Main St. Brewing Co., Ltd.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2000426\"><a href=\"/opinion/2000426/in-re-main-street-brewing-co-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">210</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">662</span></a></span> (Bankr. D.Mass.1997). Those cases do not stand for that proposition at all. Instead, Roco essentially says that when a corporation is insolvent on the date it redeems shares of its stock, the corporation receives nothing of value, 701 F.2d at 982, and <i>Main St. Brewing</i> says that stock redemption claims in bankruptcy are subordinated to the claims of creditors, 210 B.R. at 664-65. In March 1990, when Mi-Lor redeemed the stock of the defendants, the company was not insolvent and its stock was not worthless. And the equitable subordination issue in <i>Main St. Brewing</i> is not at all relevant to the fairness of the Release. Furthermore, agreements by a corporation to purchase its own stock are generally enforceable. <i>Winchell,</i> 85 N.E.2d at 317.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was no finding on fairness by the district judge and the record does not, from our reading of it, readily provide an answer. In theory, the Release could have benefitted both parties. The corporation, for its part, received stock back, which enhanced the value of its remaining shares and which conceivably could have led to some benefit to it; it also received cooperation and non-compete agreements from the defendants, a release from the defendants of claims against it, and miscellaneous benefits. In turn, the corporation paid out $1 million for the redeemed shares and other consideration and gave up claims that, eleven years later, led to a judgment of $380,807.66 (exclusive of interest). It is not clear what the value of the shares was or how to assess the expected value of the unjust enrichment claim at the time the Release was signed, given the risks and costs of litigation and other factors. In short, it is better to have the trial court determine this matter on remand. <i>Cf. Lawton v. Nyman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200444\"><a href=\"/opinion/200444/lawton-v-nyman/\"><span class=\"volume\">327</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 51 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their cross-appeal, the defendants argue that their statutory and constitutional rights were violated when the bankruptcy court <i>sua sponte</i> granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs on the statute of limitations defense in response to the same defendants' motion that the bankruptcy court had denied over two months earlier.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cross-appeal is close to frivolous.

Massachusetts does prohibit a corporation from including in its articles of organization a provision that eliminates or limits the liability of a director: (1) for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders; (2) for acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; (3) for illegal distributions to stockholders and improper loans to directors or officers; or (4) for any transactions from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 156B, &#167; 13(B)(1.5). And a Massachusetts corporation may not enact a by-law that conflicts with either a statute or its articles of organization. Ch. 156B, &#167; 16;<i>Assessors of Boston v. World Wide Broadcasting Foundation of Mass., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">317</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">598</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">188</span></span>, 191 (1945) (noting that by-laws may not enlarge or alter the powers conferred by the articles of organization or by statute).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> It is unclear from the quoted language from<i>Demoulas</i> whether the term \"disinterested\" modifies only \"directors\" or modifies both \"directors\" and \"shareholders.\" That is, can shareholders assent only if they are disinterested? If the modifier applies to both words, then, apparently, <i>interested</i> shareholders cannot, even upon full disclosure and unanimous agreement, approve self-dealing by corporate fiduciaries.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> It is true that Massachusetts has not always followed Delaware law on corporations<i>Compare Donahue,</i> 328 N.E.2d at 515 &amp; n. 17 (creating a new fiduciary duty of utmost good faith and loyalty among the stockholders of Massachusetts close corporations that is more exacting than the duty traditionally owed by corporate directors and officers), <i>with Nixon v. Blackwell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1478250\"><a href=\"/opinion/1478250/nixon-v-blackwell/\"><span class=\"volume\">626</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1366</span></a></span>, 1379-81 (Del. 1993) (noting that directors have the same fiduciary duties under Delaware law whether or not a corporation is closely held and declining to fashion \"a special judicially-created rule for minority investors\" in close corporations). Massachusetts' independent view expressed in <i>Donahue</i> does not address how the duties imposed on fiduciaries in close corporations might be affected where there is unanimous ratification by informed shareholders. The applications of fiduciary duties in <i>Donahue</i> and in <i>Demoulas</i> do not involve second-guessing the unanimous decision of informed shareholders, so neither of those cases reaches as far as this case requires.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> Under the Delaware statute, a self-dealing transaction may be approved by the consent of a majority of fully-informed and disinterested directors; by the consent of fully-informed shareholders; or by a showing that \"the contract or transaction is fair to the corporation as of the time it is authorized, approved or ratified, by the board of directors, a committee or the shareholders.\" Del.Code Ann. tit. 8, &#167; 144(a)(3). Delaware case law suggests that the approval of a majority of informed shareholders is sufficient under the statute, but the cases disagree about whether interested shareholders may be counted towards the majority</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> One commentator has noted the weaknesses of relying on shareholder approval in public corporations to protect investors' interests<i>See</i> R. Clark, <i>Corporate Law</i> 180 183 (1986).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn17\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17_ref\">17</a>\n        <p> We need not decide who has the burden of showing enforceability when there is an unadjudicated claim of an underlying breach of fiduciary duty by the corporate fiduciary. As a federal court sitting in diversity, we prefer to make narrow rulings on issues of state law<i>See, e.g., V. Suarez &amp; Co., Inc. v. Dow Brands, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200554\"><a href=\"/opinion/200554/v-suarez-co-inc-v-dow-brands-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">337</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 8-9 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> Even were it not waived, the ruling is fully supportable. A director or officer may be \"interested\" under Massachusetts law if she is a party to the transaction; has a business, financial, or familial relationship with a party to the transaction; has a material pecuniary interest in the transaction; or is subject to a controlling influence by a party to the transaction who has a material pecuniary interest<i>Harhen v. Brown,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">838</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">730</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">859</span></span>, 864 &amp; n. 5 (2000) (adopting the definition of \"interested\" stated in 1 ALI Principles of Corporate Governance &#167; 1.23 (1994)). A shareholder is \"interested\" if she is a party to the transaction or is also an interested director or officer. <i>Id.</i> The directors and shareholders who approved the Release had interconnected familial, financial, and business relationships with parties on both sides of the Release.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
