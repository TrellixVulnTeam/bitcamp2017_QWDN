Claimant Luis A. Padilla appeals from a\n\ndecision of the district court accepting the opinion and order of\n\nthe   magistrate     judge   affirming          the    Commissioner's       denial    of\n\ndisability   benefits     under     the    Social       Security    Act.      We    have\n\ncarefully reviewed the briefs and the record, Rodriguez Pagan v.\n\nSecretary of Health & Human Services, 819 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1987)\n\n(per curiam), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1012 (1988), and find that the\n\nCommissioner's      decision   is    not        supported    by    the     substantial\n\nevidence.\n\n            Padilla was 45 years old when he filed his application\n\nfor Social Security disability benefits in June 2000. His last job\n\nhad ended in November 1996, when he injured his knee with a machete\n\nwhile working as a tree cutter.             Before that, Padilla had worked\n\nfor almost twenty years as a materials handler and group leader for\n\nBaxter HealthCare Corp. Pharmaceutical Co. Padilla claimed that he\n\nwas unable to work because of hypertension, Type II diabetes,\n\narthritis, the injury to his knee, and an adjustment order with\n\ndepressed mood.       Padilla's application was denied, as was his\n\nrequest   for     reconsideration.          A    hearing     was    held    before    an\n\nadministrative law judge (\"ALJ\") in December 2001.                   Padilla waived\n\nhis right to attend, but was represented by his attorney.\n\n            The    seven-minute     hearing           consisted    entirely    of    the\n\ntestimony of the Commissioner's vocational expert in response to\n\nhypothetical questions posed by the ALJ.                  Although the vocational\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\fexpert testified that in his opinion, if the reports of Padilla's\n\ntreating psychiatrist and physician were given \"full credibility,\"\n\nPadilla is completely unable to \"function vocationally,\" the ALJ\n\ndiscredited this testimony.\n\n            Instead, in reaching his decision that Padilla retained\n\nthe residual functional capacity to perform \"light work\" under Rule\n\n202.18 of the Medical-Vocational Guidelines (\"the Grid\"), 20 C.F.R.\n\n§   404,   App.   2,    Subpt.   P,   the    ALJ     apparently   relied   on   the\n\nvocational expert's answer to a confusing compound hypothetical\n\nquestion, as well as the opinions and reports of the consulting\n\nphysicians and psychologist which were based on an incomplete\n\nmedical record.         As a result, substantial evidence in the record\n\nregarding Padilla's physical and mental impairments was ignored.\n\n            In    his    first   hypothetical         question    posed    to   the\n\nvocational expert, the ALJ directed the expert to assume that\n\nPadilla could perform \"light work\" -- with certain limitations\n\napparently derived from the physical residual functional capacity\n\n(\"RFC\")    assessment      completed        by   a    non-examining   consulting\n\nphysician -- and then asked whether such work existed in the\n\nnational economy and whether Padilla could perform his past \"heavy\"\n\nwork.   The expert did not respond to the first portion of the ALJ's\n\ncompound question, but did reply that in his opinion, Padilla is\n\nunable to perform \"the job he did in the past.\"              Perhaps attempting\n\nto alert the ALJ to the problem with the question as it was posed,\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fPadilla's counsel stipulated that the vocational expert would be\n\nable to enumerate a \"significant number of examples of jobs that\n\nunder the proposed hypothesis the claimant or any other person with\n\nthat vocational profile\" could perform (emphasis added).\n\n            The ALJ erroneously regarded this stipulation as an\n\nadmission that Padilla could perform light work.           The ALJ never\n\nasked the vocational expert whether, given any of the specific\n\nlimitations described by the consulting physicians or psychologist,\n\nPadilla could perform light work.          All that the ALJ asked was\n\nwhether Padilla could perform his past work and, assuming that\n\nPadilla could perform light work, whether such jobs existed.\n\nCounsel's   stipulation   simply   confirmed   that   if   Padilla   could\n\nperform light work, such jobs existed.\n\n            In his next question, the ALJ specifically referenced the\n\nfall 2001 mental rfc assessment prepared by Padilla's treating\n\npsychiatrist and asked the vocational expert whether, if the report\n\nwere fully credited, Padilla could \"perform any type of jobs that\n\nexist in the national economy.\"          The expert answered that \"[a]\n\nperson with those limitations could not function in the industry of\n\nour country.\"    The ALJ then asked the same question based on the\n\nfall 2001 physical assessment prepared by the physician treating\n\nPadilla for his rheumatoid arthritis.        Again, the expert answered\n\nthat \"a person under those circumstances would not be able to\n\nfunction vocationally.\"    The ALJ kept the record open for ten days\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fso that Padilla could submit his psychiatrist's progress notes, but\n\nthe ALJ did not request the treating physician's progress notes.\n\nThe   psychiatrist's   notes   were   not   submitted   within   the   time\n\nallowed.1\n\n            The ALJ found Padilla's claims of disabling physical and\n\nmental impairments not \"credible.\"       The ALJ based his decision on\n\nthe opinions of the consulting physicians and psychologist, all of\n\nwhom had examined Padilla before December 2000 or rendered their\n\nopinions based on the medical record as it existed in December\n\n2000, thus precluding consideration of the physical and psychiatric\n\nassessments    prepared   by   Padilla's    treating    psychiatrist   and\n\nphysician almost a full year later.          The ALJ explained that he\n\ndiscredited Padilla's psychiatrist's assessment (and the vocational\n\nexpert's opinion based on it) because of the missing progress\n\nnotes, but he did not explain why he ignored Padilla's physician's\n\nassessment of his physical limitations and pain and the vocational\n\nexpert's opinion based on that report.       The ALJ ruled that the type\n\nand dosage of medications Padilla took were not indicative of\n\n\"severe, chronic, and unrelenting pain,\" yet no such finding\n\nappears in the record and no medical expert testified at the\n\nhearing.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n        The progress notes were later submitted to the Appeals\nCouncil, which entered an order making them part of the evidentiary\nrecord.\n\n                                   -5-\n\f              Because the ALJ discounted and ignored the treating\n\nphysicians'        reports      and    the    corresponding      testimony     of    the\n\nvocational expert, his findings are based entirely on the use of\n\nthe Grid.      Exclusive reliance on the grid is not appropriate in\n\nmixed exertional/nonexertional cases. Ortiz v. Secretary of Health\n\n& Human Services, 890 F.2d 520, 524-25 (1st Cir. 1989) (per\n\ncuriam).       We       have   also   noted    that   \"[p]ain     can    constitute     a\n\nsignificant        non-exertional        impairment      which     precludes      naked\n\napplication of the Grid and requires use of a vocational expert.\"\n\nNguyen v. Chater, 172 F.3d 31, 36 (1st Cir. 1999) (per curiam)\n\n(collecting cases).\n\n              If    a    vocational     expert's      testimony    is    to   have    any\n\nprobative value, the hypothetical questions posed to the expert\n\nmust contain the relevant facts. In Lizotte v. Secretary of Health\n\n& Human Services, 654 F.2d 127, 131 (1st Cir. 1981), for example,\n\nthe various hypothetical questions posed to the vocational expert\n\nasked   him    to       consider      appellant's     ability     to    perform     under\n\ndifferent assumptions, including restrictions precluding appellant\n\nfrom tolerating a regular eight-hour day on a sustained basis,\n\nsignificant restrictions in appellant's ability to concentrate and\n\npay attention, and other restrictions.                    In that case, the ALJ\n\ndisregarded the opinions it determined were based on discredited\n\nevidence.      In this case, only three hypothetical questions were\n\nasked and answered, and each presents a different problem:                           the\n\n\n                                             -6-\n\ffirst question was constructed in such a way that it assumed the\n\nultimate    answer,    thus    preventing    the    vocational      expert    from\n\nproviding his opinion regarding whether Padilla could perform light\n\nwork under any set of assumptions; the ALJ decided to discredit the\n\nsecond question and answer because of missing progress notes that\n\nhave since been made part of the record; and the ALJ simply, and\n\nwithout explanation, ignored the third question and answer.\n\n            As a result, the ALJ disregarded the most current medical\n\ninformation in the record and relied exclusively on the opinions\n\nand assessments of the consulting physicians and psychologist\n\nwhich, in turn, were based on an incomplete medical record.                   This\n\nfact   counsels   against      assigning    controlling         weight   to   these\n\nopinions.    Gordils v. Secretary of Health & Human Services, 921\n\nF.2d 327, 330 (1sr Cir. 1990) (per curiam).               Furthermore, there is\n\nno dispute in the record that in addition to osteoarthritis,\n\nPadilla    suffers    from    rheumatoid    arthritis,      a   progressive     and\n\ndegenerative disease affecting all of the joints of the body, for\n\nwhich there is no cure.           One of the non-examining consulting\n\nphysicians    stated    in    December     2000    that    Padilla's     physical\n\ncondition was \"not severe at this time,\" apparently recognizing\n\nthat his condition could change, yet the ALJ did not follow up on\n\nthis issue or obtain a medical expert's opinion regarding its\n\nsignificance.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f           A similar problem attends the ALJ's decision to discredit\n\nPadilla's psychiatrist's mental RFC assessment, purportedly because\n\nof the lack of progress notes or explanation of the basis of the\n\ndoctor's opinion in the record.              The ALJ instead credited the\n\nmental RFC and Psychiatric Review Technique prepared by the non-\n\nexamining consulting psychologist, which is even more conclusory\n\nand consisted entirely of checked boxes on the forms, without\n\nnarrative or explanation, and with no mention of Padilla's suicide\n\nattempt or the \"guarded\" prognosis provided by the Commissioner's\n\nconsulting    psychiatrist.       The    opinion    of     Padilla's    treating\n\npsychiatrist is not entitled to more weight simply because of her\n\nstatus as a treating source, Rodriguez Pagan v. Secretary of Health\n\n& Human Services, 819 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1987) (per curiam), cert.\n\ndenied, 484 U.S. 1012 (1988), but rather because her opinion is\n\nconsistent both with the record as a whole and with many of the\n\nfactors listed in 20 C.F.R. § 404.1527(d).\n\n           Finally, the ALJ erred when he found that Padilla's\n\nhypertension    is   \"under   control.\"        No   such    diagnosis    appears\n\nanywhere in the record; rather, the record shows that despite the\n\ntreatment he has received over the years, Padilla's blood pressure\n\nreadings     consistently     remain    in    the   hypertensive       and   pre-\n\nhypertensive range.     On appeal, Padilla argues for the first time\n\nthat his condition is cognizable as cardiovascular disease or is\n\nmedically equivalent to a Listing Impairment under 20 C.F.R. Part\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\f404, Subpart P, App. 1, § 400.     It is well-settled that this court\n\nwill not consider issues not raised below.     Dupuis v. Secretary of\n\nHealth & Human Services, 869 F.2d 622, 623 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n           We vacate the judgment of the district court and direct\n\nthe district court to remand the case to the Commissioner for\n\nfurther   proceedings   consistent   with   this   opinion,   including\n\nobtaining any expert medical evidence needed to illuminate the\n\nmedical record.   We express no opinion as to the ultimate outcome\n\nof the case.\n\n           Vacated and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\f",

Again, the expert answered\n\nthat \"a person under those circumstances would not be able to\n\nfunction vocationally.\"    The ALJ kept the record open for ten days\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fso that Padilla could submit his psychiatrist's progress notes, but\n\nthe ALJ did not request the treating physician's progress notes.\n\nThe   psychiatrist's   notes   were   not   submitted   within   the   time\n\nallowed.1\n\n            The ALJ found Padilla's claims of disabling physical and\n\nmental impairments not \"credible.\"       The ALJ based his decision on\n\nthe opinions of the consulting physicians and psychologist, all of\n\nwhom had examined Padilla before December 2000 or rendered their\n\nopinions based on the medical record as it existed in December\n\n2000, thus precluding consideration of the physical and psychiatric\n\nassessments    prepared   by   Padilla's    treating    psychiatrist   and\n\nphysician almost a full year later.          The ALJ explained that he\n\ndiscredited Padilla's psychiatrist's assessment (and the vocational\n\nexpert's opinion based on it) because of the missing progress\n\nnotes, but he did not explain why he ignored Padilla's physician's\n\nassessment of his physical limitations and pain and the vocational\n\nexpert's opinion based on that report.       The ALJ ruled that the type\n\nand dosage of medications Padilla took were not indicative of\n\n\"severe, chronic, and unrelenting pain,\" yet no such finding\n\nappears in the record and no medical expert testified at the\n\nhearing.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n        The progress notes were later submitted to the Appeals\nCouncil, which entered an order making them part of the evidentiary\nrecord.\n\n                                   -5-\n\f              Because the ALJ discounted and ignored the treating\n\nphysicians'        reports      and    the    corresponding      testimony     of    the\n\nvocational expert, his findings are based entirely on the use of\n\nthe Grid.      Exclusive reliance on the grid is not appropriate in\n\nmixed exertional/nonexertional cases. Ortiz v.

In that case, the ALJ\n\ndisregarded the opinions it determined were based on discredited\n\nevidence.      In this case, only three hypothetical questions were\n\nasked and answered, and each presents a different problem:                           the\n\n\n                                             -6-\n\ffirst question was constructed in such a way that it assumed the\n\nultimate    answer,    thus    preventing    the    vocational      expert    from\n\nproviding his opinion regarding whether Padilla could perform light\n\nwork under any set of assumptions; the ALJ decided to discredit the\n\nsecond question and answer because of missing progress notes that\n\nhave since been made part of the record; and the ALJ simply, and\n\nwithout explanation, ignored the third question and answer.\n\n            As a result, the ALJ disregarded the most current medical\n\ninformation in the record and relied exclusively on the opinions\n\nand assessments of the consulting physicians and psychologist\n\nwhich, in turn, were based on an incomplete medical record.                   This\n\nfact   counsels   against      assigning    controlling         weight   to   these\n\nopinions.    Gordils v.

Furthermore, there is\n\nno dispute in the record that in addition to osteoarthritis,\n\nPadilla    suffers    from    rheumatoid    arthritis,      a   progressive     and\n\ndegenerative disease affecting all of the joints of the body, for\n\nwhich there is no cure.           One of the non-examining consulting\n\nphysicians    stated    in    December     2000    that    Padilla's     physical\n\ncondition was \"not severe at this time,\" apparently recognizing\n\nthat his condition could change, yet the ALJ did not follow up on\n\nthis issue or obtain a medical expert's opinion regarding its\n\nsignificance.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f           A similar problem attends the ALJ's decision to discredit\n\nPadilla's psychiatrist's mental RFC assessment, purportedly because\n\nof the lack of progress notes or explanation of the basis of the\n\ndoctor's opinion in the record.              The ALJ instead credited the\n\nmental RFC and Psychiatric Review Technique prepared by the non-\n\nexamining consulting psychologist, which is even more conclusory\n\nand consisted entirely of checked boxes on the forms, without\n\nnarrative or explanation, and with no mention of Padilla's suicide\n\nattempt or the \"guarded\" prognosis provided by the Commissioner's\n\nconsulting    psychiatrist.       The    opinion    of     Padilla's    treating\n\npsychiatrist is not entitled to more weight simply because of her\n\nstatus as a treating source, Rodriguez Pagan v.
