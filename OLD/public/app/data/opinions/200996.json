Lalonde and Machelle A.\n\nSimon-Grech, acting on behalf of a putative class of participants\n\nin and beneficiaries of an employee stock ownership plan (\"ESOP\")\n\nknown as the Textron Savings Plan, brought lawsuits (that were\n\neventually consolidated) against the plan; Textron, Inc. (the\n\nplan's sponsor); the Textron executives who allegedly administered\n\nthe plan (the \"Textron Savings Plan Committee\"); and the plan's\n\ntrustee, the   Putnam   Fiduciary   Trust   Company.   Insofar   as   is\n\nrelevant,1 the operative complaint asserts that, between January 1,\n\n2000, and December 31, 2001, defendants violated the Employee\n\nRetirement Income Security Act (ERISA) by breaching fiduciary\n\nduties owed to the class, see 29 U.S.C. § 1104(a), and by violating\n\nERISA's anti-inurement provision, see 29 U.S.C. § 1103(c)(1).2\n\nPlaintiffs seek to remedy these statutory lapses through ERISA's\n\nenforcement provisions, 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1) and (3), which\n\nauthorize certain actions by plan participants and beneficiaries.\n\n          Throughout the class period, defendants directed 50% of\n\nemployee contributions and 100% of employer matching contributions3\n\n\n\n     1\n      We confine ourselves to essentials in setting the stage for\nour discussion of the issues in this appeal. Readers interested in\ngreater detail may consult the district court's published opinion.\nSee Lalonde v. Textron, Inc., 270 F. Supp. 2d 272 (D.R.I. 2003).\n     2\n      Relevant statutory provisions are reproduced in a statutory\nappendix to this opinion in the order in which we cite them.\n     3\n      Textron contributed $0.50 or an equivalent amount of Textron\nstock for each $1.00 an employee contributed.\n\n                                -3-\n\finto a stock fund that held only Textron common stock.                     Plaintiffs\n\nclaim that, in investing so much of the class's funds in Textron\n\nstock during the class period, defendants violated duties of\n\nloyalty   owed    to    the   class   and     acted      in    an   unlawfully   self-\n\naggrandizing manner because defendants knew or had reason to know\n\nthat Textron faced troubles that were certain to cause (and did in\n\nfact cause) a significant decline in the value of its stock.                          In\n\nsupport of these claims, plaintiffs allege (with varying degrees of\n\nspecificity)     that,    during      the   class     period,       defendants     were\n\nfiduciaries      within   the   meaning       of    29    U.S.C.     §   1002(21)(A);\n\nTextron's   earnings      per   share       declined      by    over     70%;   Textron\n\ninitiated a restructuring that was expected to culminate in the\n\ntermination of over 10% of its workforce; Textron artificially\n\ninflated the price of its stock by concealing internal problems\n\nthat led to its lost earnings and restructuring (malfeasance that\n\nwas alleged to have been the subject of a federal securities\n\nlawsuit brought by Textron's shareholders); and Textron common\n\nstock significantly underperformed in comparison to the market as\n\na whole (measured in terms of the Standard & Poor's 500) and\n\nTextron's   peer       group.    Despite       this      bleak      scenario    and   in\n\ndereliction of their duties, plaintiffs say, defendants continued\n\n\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fto fund the Textron stock fund and prohibited the class from\n\ndiversifying its retirement accounts.4\n\n          Defendants elected to challenge these claims under Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).   In support of their arguments that the claims\n\nwere not viable, defendants asserted that plaintiffs had pleaded\n\ninsufficient facts to establish that any one of them was an ERISA\n\nfiduciary and/or that any one of them breached any fiduciary duties\n\nowed to the class.5    Putnam additionally argued that, as a so-\n\ncalled \"directed fiduciary,\" see 29 U.S.C. § 1103(a)(1), it lacked\n\nthe investment discretion that must be found to have been abused if\n\na viable breach of fiduciary duty claim is to lie.       Central to\n\ndefendants' arguments was the fact that the plan was an ESOP and,\n\nas such, designed to invest primarily in qualifying employer\n\n\n\n     4\n      Defendants lifted the prohibition on diversification on\nJanuary 1, 2002 (the date that corresponds with the closing of the\nclass period), at which point approximately 20% of the plan's\n35,000 or so participants \"almost immediately\" (in the words of the\ncomplaint) divested themselves of some or all of their Textron\nstock.\n     5\n      Defendants attached to their motions and relied upon in their\narguments the summary plan description, the plan documents, and the\ntrust and service agreements between Textron and Putnam.        The\ndistrict court treated these documents as merged into the complaint\nbecause the complaint's allegations depended on them and plaintiffs\nmade a number of references to them at oral argument on defendants'\nmotions. See Beddall v. State Street Bank & Trust Co., 137 F.3d\n12, 17 (1st Cir. 1998) (documents on which a complaint depends and\nto which it refers \"merge[] into the pleadings and the trial court\ncan review [them] in deciding [a Rule 12(b)(6)] motion\").\nPlaintiffs do not argue that the court erred in considering these\ndocuments or dispute that these documents are properly before us\nfor purposes of our review.\n\n                                 -5-\n\fsecurities.           See     26   U.S.C.      §    4975(e)(7)(A);      29   U.S.C.   §\n\n1107(d)(6)(A).           In   essence,      defendants'     pleading     rhetorically\n\nasked, how can defendants be found to have violated ERISA in\n\nconnection with the Textron ESOP when they did nothing more than\n\nwhat       Congress    contemplated         would      happen    when   an    employer\n\nestablishes an ESOP?\n\n              In a thorough opinion and order, the district court\n\ngranted defendants' motions to dismiss. With respect to the breach\n\nof fiduciary duty claims against the Textron defendants, the court\n\nadopted the reasoning of Moench v. Robertson, 62 F.3d 553, 571 (3d\n\nCir. 1995), and Kuper v. Iovenko, 66 F.3d 1447, 1459 (6th Cir.\n\n1995),      and   held      that   an   ESOP       fiduciary6   \"is   entitled   to   a\n\npresumption that its decision to remain invested in employer\n\n\n\n       6\n      The district court decided that factual issues precluded\ndismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) on the ground that the Textron\ndefendants were not fiduciaries of the class with respect to the\nconduct in question. See 270 F. Supp. 2d at 277 n.4. The Textron\ndefendants do not argue that the court's ruling was erroneous in\nthis respect except to suggest that there is no such thing as the\nTextron Savings Plan Committee and to contend that the plan is not\na proper defendant because (1) there are no allegations that the\nplan acted as a fiduciary with respect to its own assets, and (2)\nplaintiffs are seeking relief on the plan's behalf (and not from\nthe plan). The point about the Textron Savings Plan Committee is\nnot susceptible to resolution on the pleadings and may be taken up\nfollowing the limited remand that we order at the conclusion of\nthis opinion.    The point about the plan not being a proper\ndefendant is effectively conceded by the plaintiffs, who make no\nresponse to it in their reply brief.      We therefore affirm the\ndismissal of plaintiffs' breach of fiduciary duty and anti-\ninurement claims against the plan. Henceforth, the phrase \"the\nTextron defendants\" should be understood to encompass only Textron\nand the Textron Savings Plan Committee.\n\n                                            -6-\n\fsecurities    was    reasonable.\"         270   F.     Supp.    2d     at    279.\n\n\"Accordingly,\" the court continued, \"in order to state a viable\n\nclaim, Plaintiffs must plead facts that, if proven at trial, would\n\nestablish that [the Textron defendants] abused their discretion in\n\nfailing to diversify Textron stock during the years 2000 and 2001.\"\n\nId.\n\n            In defining the boundaries of the Textron defendants'\n\ndiscretion, the district court attempted to reconcile Congress's\n\nconcern    that   ERISA-plan   fiduciaries      must   always    act    in   the\n\ninterests of plan beneficiaries with Congress's endorsement of\n\nemployee stock ownership through the ESOP mechanism.                 See id. at\n\n278-79.7   In doing so, the district court looked to Moench, Kuper,\n\n\n      7\n      The court explained the difficulty an ESOP fiduciary faces in\nperforming this reconciliation:\n\n           An ESOP is an ERISA plan that invests primarily in\n      \"qualifying employer securities,\" which typically are\n      shares of stock in the employer that creates the plan.\n      29 U.S.C. § 1107(d)(6)(A). In creating ESOPs, Congress\n      sought to develop plans that would function as both an\n      employee retirement benefit plan and a technique of\n      corporate finance that would encourage employee ownership\n      of a company. As a result of these dual purposes, ESOPs\n      are not intended to guarantee retirement funds, and they\n      place employee retirement assets at a greater risk than\n      the typical diversified, ERISA-regulated plan . . . .\n\n           Nonetheless,   ESOPs   are  governed   by   ERISA's\n      requirements for fiduciaries. An ERISA fiduciary must\n      employ within the defined domain \"the care, skill,\n      prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then\n      prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity\n      and familiar with such matters would use.\" [29 U.S.C. §\n      1104(a)(1)(B)].   If a fiduciary fails to meet these\n      stringent requirements, it may be held liable for losses\n\n                                    -7-\n\fand Wright v. Oregon Metallurgical Corp., 222 F. Supp. 2d 1224,\n\n1233-34 (D. Or. 2002), aff'd 360 F.3d 1090 (9th Cir. 2004), all of\n\nwhich grappled with this same problem.     See 270 F. Supp. 2d at 280.\n\nBuilding from the facts and holdings of these cases, the court\n\nconcluded that, in exercising its discretion to continue purchasing\n\ncompany   stock,   an   ESOP   fiduciary   enjoys   a   presumption   of\n\nreasonableness that \"may be overcome when a precipitous decline in\n\nthe employer's stock is combined with evidence that the company is\n\non the brink of collapse or is undergoing serious mismanagement.\"\n\nId.   The court then granted the Textron defendants' motion to\n\ndismiss because \"[t]his is not one of those cases.\"            Id.    In\n\nsupport of its ruling, the court stated that the complaint had\n\nalleged only a drop in stock price, a decline in corporate profits,\n\nand a restructuring of the company during the class period.           See\n\nid.   The court also speculated that, had the Textron defendants\n\ndecided not to remain fully invested in Textron stock per the terms\n\nof the plan, they might have triggered an even steeper sell-off\n\nand/or invited a lawsuit when the stock later appreciated. See id.\n\n           Although this line of reasoning applies with equal force\n\nto the breach of fiduciary duty claims against Putnam, the district\n\n\n      to the plan that result from breaches of that duty. 29\n      U.S.C. § 1109(a). Consequently, ESOP fiduciaries are in\n      the unique situation of having to facilitate the ESOP\n      goal of employee ownership, while at the same time being\n      bound by ERISA's rigorous fiduciary obligations.\n\nId. at 278 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n                                  -8-\n\fcourt also went on to analyze whether Putnam was a \"directed\n\nfiduciary\" within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. § 1103(a)(1).    See id.\n\nat 280-82.     Following the course charted in Beddall, 137 F.3d at\n\n19-21, the court parsed the plan documents and concluded that\n\nPutnam was a directed fiduciary as a matter of law.      See 270 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 281-82.   As such, the court reasoned, Putnam lacked the\n\ndiscretionary authority to do what plaintiffs say it should have\n\ndone:    ignore the directions of the plan administrator to keep\n\ninvesting (and to remain invested in) Textron stock.     See id. at\n\n282.    The court did not, however, go on to discuss plaintiffs'\n\nalternative argument that, even if Putnam were a directed trustee,\n\nit still could be held to have violated 29 U.S.C. 1103(a)(1) if it\n\nfollowed directions from the Textron defendants that were \"contrary\n\nto [ERISA].\"    Id.\n\n           With respect to plaintiffs' anti-inurement claims, the\n\ndistrict court granted Textron's motion to dismiss on the basis of\n\na line of cases holding that 29 U.S.C. § 1103(c)(1) \"does not\n\nprevent an employer from enjoying indirect benefits associated with\n\nplan investment decisions.\"    Id. at 284 (collecting cases).   The\n\ncourt granted Putnam's motion on the basis of its prior ruling that\n\nPutnam lacked discretion with respect to investment decisions and\n\ntherefore was not a fiduciary subject to liability under ERISA's\n\nanti-inurement provision.    Id. at 284 n.9.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f          On appeal, plaintiffs contend that the district court\n\nerroneously scrutinized their allegations as if defendants had\n\nmoved not to dismiss the complaint under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6),\n\nbut rather for summary judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.            In\n\npressing this claim, plaintiffs make a subsidiary argument that the\n\ncourt defined an ESOP fiduciary's duty too narrowly when it stated\n\nthat a discontinuation of plan funding is required only where there\n\nis a precipitous decline in the value of the company's stock\n\ncombined with evidence of an impending collapse or serious internal\n\nmismanagement.8   Textron responds by suggesting in a footnote that\n\nthe court's formulation of an ESOP fiduciary's duty \"is not . . .\n\nadequately   deferential   to   Congress's   intent   to   foster   ESOP\n\ninvestment in employer stock,\"9 but otherwise is content to defend\n\n\n\n\n     8\n      Plaintiffs also take issue with the court's conclusions that\nPutnam lacked discretion with respect to the funds and that the\nabsence of such discretion automatically rendered non-viable their\nbreach of fiduciary duty and anti-inurement claims.     We do not\nreach these arguments (or the responses to them) because, as we\nshall explain, plaintiffs failed to allege facts sufficient to\nground a judgment in their favor even if disputes about the plan\ndocuments and the law were resolved in their favor.\n     9\n      The Ninth Circuit recently expressed sympathy for Textron's\nposition in its opinion affirming the Wright decision that was\nrelied upon by the district court.      See 360 F.3d at 1097-98\n(questioning in dicta whether Moench and Kuper undermine\ncongressional purpose in holding that ESOP fiduciaries sometimes\nmust diversify plan investments); id. at 1098 n.4 (suggesting in\ndicta that Moench and Kuper are \"problematic [under the federal\nsecurities laws] to the extent that [they] inadvertently\nencourage[] corporate officers to utilize inside information for\nthe exclusive benefit of the corporation and its employees\").\n\n                                 -10-\n\fthe court's dismissal under the rule the court derived from Moench,\n\nKuper, and Wright.\n\n            We turn first to plaintiffs' breach of fiduciary duty\n\nclaims against Textron.         As set forth above, the district court\n\nconcluded that the allegations in the complaint (and the reasonable\n\ninferences they give rise to) were insufficient because the facts\n\nalleged -- declines in stock price and corporate profits and a\n\nsignificant    corporate   restructuring       --   never   could   support    a\n\nfinding that the Moench/Kuper/Wright rule had been satisfied.                See\n\nLalonde, 270 F. Supp. 2d at 280.           As an initial matter, we share\n\nthe parties' concerns about the court's distillation of the breach\n\nof fiduciary standard into the more specific decisional principle\n\nextracted from Moench, Kuper, and Wright and applied to plaintiffs'\n\npleading. Because the important and complex area of law implicated\n\nby plaintiffs' claims is neither mature nor uniform, see supra n.9,\n\nwe believe that we would run a very high risk of error were we to\n\nlay down a hard-and-fast rule (or to endorse the district court's\n\nrule) based only on the statute's text and history, the sparse\n\npleadings, and the few and discordant judicial decisions discussing\n\nthe issue     we   face.   Under    the    circumstances,    further   record\n\ndevelopment -- and particularly input from those with expertise in\n\nthe arcane area of the law where ERISA's ESOP provisions intersect\n\nwith its fiduciary duty requirements -- seems to us essential to a\n\nreasoned    elaboration    of   that   which    constitutes    a    breach    of\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\ffiduciary duty in this context.      Cf. Doe v. Walker, 193 F.3d 42, 46\n\n(1st Cir. 1999) (vacating a Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) dismissal on\n\nan issue with \"important social and moral implications\" and with an\n\nundeveloped factual background \"in part because further facts may\n\nmake it unnecessary to decide the hard case but also because the\n\nfacts are likely to contribute to a more sensitive assessment of\n\nwhat the law 'is' (which, absent decisive precedent, means what it\n\n'should be')\").\n\n              In any event, we believe that the breach of fiduciary\n\nduty judgment in favor of the Textron defendants cannot withstand\n\nconventional Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) scrutiny. A complaint should\n\nbe dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6) \"only if it is clear that no\n\nrelief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved\n\nconsistent with the allegations.\" Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534\n\nU.S. 506, 514 (2002); see also id. at 511 (\"When a federal court\n\nreviews the sufficiency of a complaint, before the reception of any\n\nevidence either by affidavit or admissions, its task is necessarily\n\na   limited    one.   The   issue   is   not   whether   a   plaintiff    will\n\nultimately prevail but whether the claimant is entitled to offer\n\nevidence to support the claims.\") (quoting Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416\n\nU.S. 232, 236 (1974) (internal quotation marks omitted)).                Here,\n\nthe district court's analysis, while perhaps convincing on its own\n\nterms, failed to take account of plaintiffs' allegation that,\n\nduring the period identified in the complaint, Textron artificially\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\finflated its stock price by concealing \"the disparate problems\n\nthroughout Textron's segments and their adverse effect on Textron\n\nwhich     are    the   subject    of   a   federal   securities   lawsuit    by\n\nshareholders against Textron and certain of its officers and\n\ndirectors.\"         While this allegation is not terribly specific,\n\nTextron surely is aware of the nature of the charges it faces in\n\nthe separate lawsuit.10          The allegation is thus sufficient to play\n\nits part in effectuating the purposes of Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a):                to\n\ngive Textron \"fair notice of what [plaintiffs'] claim is and the\n\ngrounds upon which it rests.\" Id. at 512 (quoting Conley v. Gibson,\n\n355 U.S. 41, 47 (1957) (internal quotation marks omitted)).                 And,\n\nwhen combined with the other allegations, it is sufficient to clear\n\nthe Rule 12(b)(6) hurdle.\n\n                Consider, for example, a (purely hypothetical) scenario\n\nunder which plaintiffs unearth during discovery documents showing\n\nthat, during the class period, the Textron officials responsible\n\nfor administration of the ESOP were concerned that Textron was not\n\ngoing to survive its downsizing and wanted the plan documents to be\n\namended so as to keep their employees from investing in a dying\n\nventure.        Consider further a scenario under which the plaintiffs\n\nuncover evidence that these officials were dissuaded from so acting\n\n\n\n     10\n      If it were not, the proper response should have been a motion\nfor a more definite statement under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(e) and not\na motion for dismissal on the merits. See Swierkiewicz, 534 U.S.\nat 514.\n\n                                       -13-\n\fby higher-ups concerned about sustaining the company's stock price\n\nuntil stock options that they held could vest.                  Such evidence\n\ncertainly    would   be    entirely       consistent     with     plaintiffs'\n\nallegations.    Moreover, it might well be sufficient (much would\n\ndepend on the nature of the additional factual development to which\n\nwe previously alluded) to support a finding that the Textron\n\ndefendants had breached their fiduciary duty to the class.\n\n            The odds of plaintiffs succeeding on their breach of\n\nfiduciary duty claims against the Textron defendants might be very\n\nlong, but \"that is not the test.\"          Swierkiewicz, 534 U.S. at 515\n\n(quoting Scheuer, 416 U.S. at 236) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).    Accordingly, we shall vacate the judgment in favor of\n\nthe   Textron   defendants   and    remand     for     further    proceedings\n\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n            Plaintiffs'   breach   of   fiduciary      duty   claims   against\n\nPutnam, and their anti-inurement claims against all defendants,\n\nstand on different footing.        Even if we were to assume arguendo\n\nthat the district court erred in concluding that Putnam was a\n\ndirected fiduciary and that directed fiduciaries are shielded from\n\nliability for following the directives in the plan documents, there\n\nis absolutely nothing in the complaint which permits an inference\n\nthat Putnam abused any discretion it might have had.             Putnam is not\n\nalleged to have knowledge of any malfeasance within Textron; it is\n\n\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\falleged only to have learned (as the events were unfolding) that\n\nTextron's stock price and profits were declining and that the\n\ncompany was undergoing a restructuring.       As the district court\n\naptly observed, this simply is not enough to ground a finding that\n\nPutnam violated any duties it might have owed to the class.         It\n\nwould subvert the purposes of ERISA to permit lawsuits against plan\n\nfiduciaries (again, assuming that Putnam is a plan fiduciary) every\n\ntime a company's fortunes took a relatively unexceptional turn for\n\nthe worse.    We therefore decline to upset the judgment in favor of\n\nPutnam on plaintiff's breach of fiduciary duty claims.        So too do\n\nwe decline to upset the judgments in favor of all defendants on\n\nplaintiffs' anti-inurement claims, the appellate attacks on which\n\nare set forth in a few sentences which seek only to differentiate\n\nthe facts of this case from those of the cases relied upon by the\n\ndistrict court and which make no effort at all to explain how the\n\nscheme alleged caused plan assets to inure to the benefit of\n\nTextron itself.

Lalonde and Machelle A. Simon-Grech, acting on behalf of a putative class of participants in and beneficiaries of an employee stock ownership plan (\"ESOP\") known as the Textron Savings Plan, brought lawsuits (that were eventually consolidated) against the plan; Textron, Inc. (the plan's sponsor); the Textron executives who allegedly administered the plan (the \"Textron Savings Plan Committee\"); and the plan's trustee, the Putnam Fiduciary Trust Company. Insofar as is relevant,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> the operative complaint asserts that, between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2001, defendants violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) by breaching fiduciary duties owed to the class, <i>see</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1104(a), and by violating ERISA's anti-inurement provision, <i>see</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1103(c)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Plaintiffs seek to remedy these statutory lapses through ERISA's enforcement provisions, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(a)(1) and (3), which authorize certain actions by plan participants and beneficiaries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Throughout the class period, defendants directed 50% of employee contributions and 100% of employer matching contributions<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> into a stock fund that held only Textron common stock. Plaintiffs claim that, in investing so much of the class's funds in Textron stock during the class period, defendants violated duties of loyalty owed to the class and acted in an unlawfully self-aggrandizing manner because defendants knew or had reason to know that Textron faced troubles that were certain to cause (and did in fact cause) a significant decline in the value of its stock. In support of these claims, plaintiffs allege (with varying degrees of specificity) that, during the class period, defendants were fiduciaries within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1002(21)(A); Textron's earnings per share declined by over 70%; Textron initiated a restructuring that was expected to culminate in the termination of over 10% of its workforce; Textron artificially inflated the price of its stock by concealing internal problems that led to its lost earnings and restructuring (malfeasance that was alleged to have been the subject of a federal securities lawsuit brought by Textron's shareholders); and Textron common stock significantly underperformed in comparison to the market as a whole (measured in terms of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500) and Textron's peer group. Despite this bleak scenario and in dereliction of their duties, plaintiffs say, defendants continued to fund the Textron stock fund and prohibited the class from diversifying its retirement accounts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants elected to challenge these claims under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). In support of their arguments that the claims were not viable, defendants asserted that plaintiffs had pleaded insufficient facts to establish that any one of them was an ERISA fiduciary and/or that any one of them breached any fiduciary duties owed to the class.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Putnam additionally argued that, as a so-called \"directed fiduciary,\" <i>see</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1103(a)(1), it lacked the investment discretion that must be found to have been abused if a viable breach of fiduciary duty claim is to lie. Central to defendants' arguments was the fact that the plan was an ESOP and, as such, designed to invest primarily in qualifying employer securities. <i>See</i> 26 U.S.C. &#167; 4975(e)(7)(A); 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1107(d)(6)(A). In essence, defendants' pleading rhetorically asked, how can defendants be found to have violated ERISA in connection with the Textron ESOP when they did nothing more than what Congress contemplated would happen when an employer establishes an ESOP?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a thorough opinion and order, the district court granted defendants' motions to dismiss. With respect to the breach of fiduciary duty claims against the Textron defendants, the court adopted the reasoning of <i>Moench v. Robertson,</i> 62 F.3d 553, 571 (3d Cir.1995), and <i>Kuper v. Iovenko,</i> 66 F.3d 1447, 1459 (6th Cir.1995), and held that an ESOP fiduciary<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> \"is entitled to a presumption that its decision to remain invested in employer securities was reasonable.\" 270 F.Supp.2d at 279. \"Accordingly,\" the court continued, \"in order to state a viable claim, Plaintiffs must plead facts that, if proven at trial, would establish that [the Textron defendants] abused their discretion in failing to diversify Textron stock during the years 2000 and 2001.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In defining the boundaries of the Textron defendants' discretion, the district court attempted to reconcile Congress's concern that ERISA-plan fiduciaries must always act in the interests of plan beneficiaries with Congress's endorsement of employee stock ownership through the ESOP mechanism. <i>See id.</i> at 278-79.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> In doing so, the district court looked to <i>Moench, Kuper,</i> and <i>Wright v. Oregon Metallurgical Corp.,</i> 222 F.Supp.2d 1224, 1233-34 (D.Or.2002), <i>aff'd</i> 360 F.3d 1090 (9th Cir.2004), all of which grappled with this same problem. <i>See</i> 270 F.Supp.2d at 280. Building from the facts and holdings of these cases, the court concluded that, in exercising its discretion to continue purchasing company stock, an ESOP fiduciary enjoys a presumption of reasonableness that \"may be overcome when a precipitous decline in the employer's stock is combined with evidence that the company is on the brink of collapse or is undergoing serious mismanagement.\" <i>Id.</i> The court then granted the Textron defendants' motion to dismiss because \"[t]his is not one of those cases.\" <i>Id.</i> In support of its ruling, the court stated that the complaint had alleged only a drop in stock price, a decline in corporate profits, and a restructuring of the company during the class period. <i>See id.</i> The court also speculated that, had the Textron defendants decided not to remain fully invested in Textron stock per the terms of the plan, they might have triggered an even steeper sell-off and/or invited a lawsuit when the stock later appreciated. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although this line of reasoning applies with equal force to the breach of fiduciary duty claims against Putnam, the district court also went on to analyze whether Putnam was a \"directed fiduciary\" within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1103(a)(1). <i>See id.</i> at 280-82. Following the course charted in <i>Beddall,</i> 137 F.3d at 19-21, the court parsed the plan documents and concluded that Putnam was a directed fiduciary as a matter of law. <i>See</i> 270 F.Supp.2d at 281-82. As such, the court reasoned, Putnam lacked the discretionary authority to do what plaintiffs say it should have done: ignore the directions of the plan administrator to keep investing (and to remain invested in) Textron stock. <i>See id.</i> at 282. The court did not, however, go on to discuss plaintiffs' alternative argument that, even if Putnam were a directed trustee, it still could be held to have violated 29 U.S.C. 1103(a)(1) if it followed directions from the Textron defendants that were \"contrary to [ERISA].\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to plaintiffs' anti-inurement claims, the district court granted Textron's motion to dismiss on the basis of a line of cases holding that 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1103(c)(1) \"does not prevent an employer from enjoying indirect benefits associated with plan investment decisions.\" <i>Id.</i> at 284 (collecting cases). The court granted Putnam's motion on the basis of its prior ruling that Putnam lacked discretion with respect to investment decisions and therefore was not a fiduciary subject to liability under ERISA's anti-inurement provision. <i>Id.</i> at 284 n. 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, plaintiffs contend that the district court erroneously scrutinized their allegations as if defendants had moved not to dismiss the complaint under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), but rather for summary judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56. In pressing this claim, plaintiffs make a subsidiary argument that the court defined an ESOP fiduciary's duty too narrowly when it stated that a discontinuation of plan funding is required only where there is a precipitous decline in the value of the company's stock combined with evidence of an impending collapse or serious internal mismanagement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Textron responds by suggesting in a footnote that the court's formulation of an ESOP fiduciary's duty \"is not ... adequately deferential to Congress's intent to foster ESOP investment in employer stock,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> but otherwise is content to defend the court's dismissal under the rule the court derived from <i>Moench, Kuper,</i> and <i>Wright.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn first to plaintiffs' breach of fiduciary duty claims against Textron. As set forth above, the district court concluded that the allegations in the complaint (and the reasonable inferences they give rise to) were insufficient because the facts alleged &#8212; declines in stock price and corporate profits and a significant corporate restructuring &#8212; never could support a finding that the <i>Moench/Kuper/Wright</i> rule had been satisfied. <i>See Lalonde,</i> 270 F.Supp.2d at 280. As an initial matter, we share the parties' concerns about the court's distillation of the breach of fiduciary standard into the more specific decisional principle extracted from <i>Moench, Kuper,</i> and <i>Wright</i> and applied to plaintiffs' pleading. Because the important and complex area of law implicated by plaintiffs' claims is neither mature nor uniform, <i>see supra</i> n. 9, we believe that we would run a very high risk of error were we to lay down a hard-and-fast rule (or to endorse the district court's rule) based only on the statute's text and history, the sparse pleadings, and the few and discordant judicial decisions discussing the issue we face. Under the circumstances, further record development &#8212; and particularly input from those with expertise in the arcane area of the law where ERISA's ESOP provisions intersect with its fiduciary duty requirements &#8212; seems to us essential to a reasoned elaboration of that which constitutes a breach of fiduciary duty in this context. <i>Cf. Doe v. Walker,</i> 193 F.3d 42, 46 (1st Cir.1999) (vacating a Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) dismissal on an issue with \"important social and moral implications\" and with an undeveloped factual background \"in part because further facts may make it unnecessary to decide the hard case but also because the facts are likely to contribute to a more sensitive assessment of what the law `is' (which, absent decisive precedent, means what it `should be')\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, we believe that the breach of fiduciary duty judgment in favor of the Textron defendants cannot withstand conventional Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) scrutiny.

Sorema N.A.,</i> 534 U.S. 506, 514, 122 S.Ct. 992, 152 L.Ed.2d 1 (2002); <i>see also id.</i> at 511, 122 S.Ct. 992 (\"When a federal court reviews the sufficiency of a complaint, before the reception of any evidence either by affidavit or admissions, its task is necessarily a limited one.

Rhodes,</i> 416 U.S. 232, 236, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 40 L.Ed.2d 90 (1974) (internal quotation marks omitted)). Here, the district court's analysis, while perhaps convincing on its own terms, failed to take account of plaintiffs' allegation that, during the period identified in the complaint, Textron artificially inflated its stock price by concealing \"the disparate problems throughout Textron's segments and their adverse effect on Textron which are the subject of a federal securities lawsuit by shareholders against Textron and certain of its officers and directors.\" While this allegation is not terribly specific, Textron surely is aware of the nature of the charges it faces in the separate lawsuit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> The allegation is thus sufficient to play its part in effectuating the purposes of Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a): to give Textron \"fair notice of what [plaintiffs'] claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\" <i>Id.</i> at 512, 94 S.Ct. 1683 (quoting <i>Conley v. Gibson,</i> 355 U.S. 41, 47, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957) (internal quotation marks omitted)). And, when combined with the other allegations, it is sufficient to clear the Rule 12(b)(6) hurdle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consider, for example, a (purely hypothetical) scenario under which plaintiffs unearth during discovery documents showing that, during the class period, the Textron officials responsible for administration of the ESOP were concerned that Textron was not going to survive its downsizing and wanted the plan documents to be amended so as to keep their employees from investing in a dying venture. Consider further a scenario under which the plaintiffs uncover evidence that these officials were dissuaded from so acting by higher-ups concerned about sustaining the company's stock price until stock options that they held could vest. Such evidence certainly would be entirely consistent with plaintiffs' allegations. Moreover, it might well be sufficient (much would depend on the nature of the additional factual development to which we previously alluded) to support a finding that the Textron defendants had breached their fiduciary duty to the class.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The odds of plaintiffs succeeding on their breach of fiduciary duty claims against the Textron defendants might be very long, but \"that is not the test.\" <i>Swierkiewicz,</i> 534 U.S. at 515, 122 S.Ct. 992 (quoting <i>Scheuer,</i> 416 U.S. at 236, 94 S.Ct. 1683) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, we shall vacate the judgment in favor of the Textron defendants and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' breach of fiduciary duty claims against Putnam, and their anti-inurement claims against all defendants, stand on different footing. Even if we were to assume <i>arguendo</i> that the district court erred in concluding that Putnam was a directed fiduciary and that directed fiduciaries are shielded from liability for following the directives in the plan documents, there is absolutely nothing in the complaint which permits an inference that Putnam abused any discretion it might have had. Putnam is not alleged to have knowledge of any malfeasance within Textron; it is alleged only to have learned (as the events were unfolding) that Textron's stock price and profits were declining and that the company was undergoing a restructuring. As the district court aptly observed, this simply is not enough to ground a finding that Putnam violated any duties it might have owed to the class. It would subvert the purposes of ERISA to permit lawsuits against plan fiduciaries (again, assuming that Putnam is a plan fiduciary) every time a company's fortunes took a relatively unexceptional turn for the worse. We therefore decline to upset the judgment in favor of Putnam on plaintiff's breach of fiduciary duty claims. So too do we decline to upset the judgments in favor of all defendants on plaintiffs' anti-inurement claims, the appellate attacks on which are set forth in a few sentences which seek only to differentiate the facts of this case from those of the cases relied upon by the district court and which make no effort at all to explain how the scheme alleged caused plan assets to inure to the benefit of Textron itself. <i>See United States v.

State Street Bank &amp; Trust Co.,</i> 137 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir.1998) (documents on which a complaint depends and to which it refers \"merge[] into the pleadings and the trial court can review [them] in deciding [a Rule 12(b)(6)] motion\").

The Textron defendants do not argue that the court's ruling was erroneous in this respect except to suggest that there is no such thing as the Textron Savings Plan Committee and to contend that the plan is not a proper defendant because (1) there are no allegations that the plan acted as a fiduciary with respect to its own assets, and (2) plaintiffs are seeking relief on the plan's behalf (and not from the plan). The point about the Textron Savings Plan Committee is not susceptible to resolution on the pleadings and may be taken up following the limited remand that we order at the conclusion of this opinion. The point about the plan not being a proper defendant is effectively conceded by the plaintiffs, who make no response to it in their reply brief. We therefore affirm the dismissal of plaintiffs' breach of fiduciary duty and anti-inurement claims against the plan. Henceforth, the phrase \"the Textron defendants\" should be understood to encompass only Textron and the Textron Savings Plan Committee.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The court explained the difficulty an ESOP fiduciary faces in performing this reconciliation:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">An ESOP is an ERISA plan that invests primarily in \"qualifying employer securities,\" which typically are shares of stock in the employer that creates the plan. 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1107(d)(6)(A). In creating ESOPs, Congress sought to develop plans that would function as both an employee retirement benefit plan and a technique of corporate finance that would encourage employee ownership of a company. As a result of these dual purposes, ESOPs are not intended to guarantee retirement funds, and they place employee retirement assets at a greater risk than the typical diversified, ERISA-regulated plan....</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, ESOPs are governed by ERISA's requirements for fiduciaries. An ERISA fiduciary must employ within the defined domain \"the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use.\" [29 U.S.C. &#167; 1104(a)(1)(B)]. If a fiduciary fails to meet these stringent requirements, it may be held liable for losses to the plan that result from breaches of that duty. 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1109(a). Consequently, ESOP fiduciaries are in the unique situation of having to facilitate the ESOP goal of employee ownership, while at the same time being bound by ERISA's rigorous fiduciary obligations.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 278 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Plaintiffs also take issue with the court's conclusions that Putnam lacked discretion with respect to the funds and that the absence of such discretion automatically rendered non-viable their breach of fiduciary duty and anti-inurement claims.

Plaintiffs claim that, in investing so much of the class's funds in Textron stock during the class period, defendants violated duties of loyalty owed to the class and acted in an unlawfully self-aggrandizing manner because defendants knew or had reason to know that Textron faced troubles that were certain to cause (and did in fact cause) a significant decline in the value of its stock. In support of these claims, plaintiffs allege (with varying degrees of specificity) that, during the class period, defendants were fiduciaries within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1002(21)(A); Textron's earnings per share declined by over 70%; Textron initiated a restructuring that was expected to culminate in the termination of over 10% of its workforce; Textron artificially inflated the price of its stock by concealing internal problems that led to its lost earnings and restructuring (malfeasance that was alleged to have been the subject of a federal securities lawsuit brought by Textron's shareholders); and Textron common stock significantly underperformed in comparison to the market as a whole (measured in terms of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500) and Textron's peer group. Despite this bleak scenario and in dereliction of their duties, plaintiffs say, defendants continued to fund the Textron stock fund and prohibited the class from diversifying its retirement accounts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants elected to challenge these claims under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).

Central to defendants' arguments was the fact that the plan was an ESOP and, as such, designed to invest primarily in qualifying employer securities. <i>See</i> 26 U.S.C. &#167; 4975(e)(7)(A); 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1107(d)(6)(A).

Building from the facts and holdings of these cases, the court concluded that, in exercising its discretion to continue purchasing company stock, an ESOP fiduciary enjoys a presumption of reasonableness that \"may be overcome when a precipitous decline in the employer's stock is combined with evidence that the company is on the brink of collapse or is undergoing serious mismanagement.\" <i>Id.</i> The court then granted the Textron defendants' motion to dismiss because \"[t]his is not one of those cases.\" <i>Id.</i> In support of its ruling, the court stated that the complaint had alleged only a drop in stock price, a decline in corporate profits, and a restructuring of the company during the class period. <i>See id.</i> The court also speculated that, had the Textron defendants decided not to remain fully invested in Textron stock per the terms of the plan, they might have triggered an even steeper sell-off and/or invited a lawsuit when the stock later appreciated. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although this line of reasoning applies with equal force to the breach of fiduciary duty claims against Putnam, the district court also went on to analyze whether Putnam was a \"directed fiduciary\" within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1103(a)(1). <i>See id.</i> at 280-82. Following the course charted in <i>Beddall,</i> 137 F.3d at 19-21, the court parsed the plan documents and concluded that Putnam was a directed fiduciary as a matter of law. <i>See</i> 270 F.Supp.2d at 281-82. As such, the court reasoned, Putnam lacked the discretionary authority to do what plaintiffs say it should have done: ignore the directions of the plan administrator to keep investing (and to remain invested in) Textron stock. <i>See id.</i> at 282. The court did not, however, go on to discuss plaintiffs' alternative argument that, even if Putnam were a directed trustee, it still could be held to have violated 29 U.S.C. 1103(a)(1) if it followed directions from the Textron defendants that were \"contrary to [ERISA].\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to plaintiffs' anti-inurement claims, the district court granted Textron's motion to dismiss on the basis of a line of cases holding that 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1103(c)(1) \"does not prevent an employer from enjoying indirect benefits associated with plan investment decisions.\" <i>Id.</i> at 284 (collecting cases). The court granted Putnam's motion on the basis of its prior ruling that Putnam lacked discretion with respect to investment decisions and therefore was not a fiduciary subject to liability under ERISA's anti-inurement provision. <i>Id.</i> at 284 n. 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, plaintiffs contend that the district court erroneously scrutinized their allegations as if defendants had moved not to dismiss the complaint under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), but rather for summary judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56. In pressing this claim, plaintiffs make a subsidiary argument that the court defined an ESOP fiduciary's duty too narrowly when it stated that a discontinuation of plan funding is required only where there is a precipitous decline in the value of the company's stock combined with evidence of an impending collapse or serious internal mismanagement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Textron responds by suggesting in a footnote that the court's formulation of an ESOP fiduciary's duty \"is not ... adequately deferential to Congress's intent to foster ESOP investment in employer stock,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> but otherwise is content to defend the court's dismissal under the rule the court derived from <i>Moench, Kuper,</i> and <i>Wright.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn first to plaintiffs' breach of fiduciary duty claims against Textron. As set forth above, the district court concluded that the allegations in the complaint (and the reasonable inferences they give rise to) were insufficient because the facts alleged &#8212; declines in stock price and corporate profits and a significant corporate restructuring &#8212; never could support a finding that the <i>Moench/Kuper/Wright</i> rule had been satisfied. <i>See Lalonde,</i> 270 F.Supp.2d at 280. As an initial matter, we share the parties' concerns about the court's distillation of the breach of fiduciary standard into the more specific decisional principle extracted from <i>Moench, Kuper,</i> and <i>Wright</i> and applied to plaintiffs' pleading. Because the important and complex area of law implicated by plaintiffs' claims is neither mature nor uniform, <i>see supra</i> n. 9, we believe that we would run a very high risk of error were we to lay down a hard-and-fast rule (or to endorse the district court's rule) based only on the statute's text and history, the sparse pleadings, and the few and discordant judicial decisions discussing the issue we face. Under the circumstances, further record development &#8212; and particularly input from those with expertise in the arcane area of the law where ERISA's ESOP provisions intersect with its fiduciary duty requirements &#8212; seems to us essential to a reasoned elaboration of that which constitutes a breach of fiduciary duty in this context. <i>Cf.

Consider further a scenario under which the plaintiffs uncover evidence that these officials were dissuaded from so acting by higher-ups concerned about sustaining the company's stock price until stock options that they held could vest. Such evidence certainly would be entirely consistent with plaintiffs' allegations.

Even if we were to assume <i>arguendo</i> that the district court erred in concluding that Putnam was a directed fiduciary and that directed fiduciaries are shielded from liability for following the directives in the plan documents, there is absolutely nothing in the complaint which permits an inference that Putnam abused any discretion it might have had. Putnam is not alleged to have knowledge of any malfeasance within Textron; it is alleged only to have learned (as the events were unfolding) that Textron's stock price and profits were declining and that the company was undergoing a restructuring. As the district court aptly observed, this simply is not enough to ground a finding that Putnam violated any duties it might have owed to the class. It would subvert the purposes of ERISA to permit lawsuits against plan fiduciaries (again, assuming that Putnam is a plan fiduciary) every time a company's fortunes took a relatively unexceptional turn for the worse. We therefore decline to upset the judgment in favor of Putnam on plaintiff's breach of fiduciary duty claims. So too do we decline to upset the judgments in favor of all defendants on plaintiffs' anti-inurement claims, the appellate attacks on which are set forth in a few sentences which seek only to differentiate the facts of this case from those of the cases relied upon by the district court and which make no effort at all to explain how the scheme alleged caused plan assets to inure to the benefit of Textron itself. <i>See United States v.

State Street Bank &amp; Trust Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197817\"><a href=\"/opinion/197817/beddall-v-state-street-trust/\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1998) (documents on which a complaint depends and to which it refers \"merge[] into the pleadings and the trial court can review [them] in deciding [a Rule 12(b)(6)] motion\"). Plaintiffs do not argue that the court erred in considering these documents or dispute that these documents are properly before us for purposes of our review.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The district court decided that factual issues precluded dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) on the ground that the Textron defendants were not fiduciaries of the class with respect to the conduct in question<i>See</i> 270 F.Supp.2d at 277 n. 4. The Textron defendants do not argue that the court's ruling was erroneous in this respect except to suggest that there is no such thing as the Textron Savings Plan Committee and to contend that the plan is not a proper defendant because (1) there are no allegations that the plan acted as a fiduciary with respect to its own assets, and (2) plaintiffs are seeking relief on the plan's behalf (and not from the plan). The point about the Textron Savings Plan Committee is not susceptible to resolution on the pleadings and may be taken up following the limited remand that we order at the conclusion of this opinion. The point about the plan not being a proper defendant is effectively conceded by the plaintiffs, who make no response to it in their reply brief. We therefore affirm the dismissal of plaintiffs' breach of fiduciary duty and anti-inurement claims against the plan. Henceforth, the phrase \"the Textron defendants\" should be understood to encompass only Textron and the Textron Savings Plan Committee.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The court explained the difficulty an ESOP fiduciary faces in performing this reconciliation:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">An ESOP is an ERISA plan that invests primarily in \"qualifying employer securities,\" which typically are shares of stock in the employer that creates the plan. 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1107(d)(6)(A). In creating ESOPs, Congress sought to develop plans that would function as both an employee retirement benefit plan and a technique of corporate finance that would encourage employee ownership of a company. As a result of these dual purposes, ESOPs are not intended to guarantee retirement funds, and they place employee retirement assets at a greater risk than the typical diversified, ERISA-regulated plan....</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, ESOPs are governed by ERISA's requirements for fiduciaries. An ERISA fiduciary must employ within the defined domain \"the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use.\" [29 U.S.C. &#167; 1104(a)(1)(B)]. If a fiduciary fails to meet these stringent requirements, it may be held liable for losses to the plan that result from breaches of that duty. 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1109(a). Consequently, ESOP fiduciaries are in the unique situation of having to facilitate the ESOP goal of employee ownership, while at the same time being bound by ERISA's rigorous fiduciary obligations.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 278 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Plaintiffs also take issue with the court's conclusions that Putnam lacked discretion with respect to the funds and that the absence of such discretion automatically rendered non-viable their breach of fiduciary duty and anti-inurement claims.
