José Antonio Fusté, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                        Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n                  Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                    and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Rafael A. Oliveras Lopez de Victoria for appellants.\n     Isabel Muñoz-Acosta, Assistant United States Attorney with\nwhom H.S. Garcia, United States Attorney and Miguel A. Fernandez,\nAssistant United States Attorney, Chief, Civil Division, were on\nbrief, for appellees.\n\n\n\n                              June 3, 2005\n\f              Per Curiam.     Plaintiffs Nery F. Camacho-Rodríguez, a\n\nUnited States postal service letter carrier, and members of his\n\nfamily sued the Postmaster General of the United States and a\n\npostal service employee for violations of the Americans with\n\nDisabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213.           The plaintiffs\n\nasserted that the postal service failed reasonably to accommodate\n\nCamacho for a severe back condition that prevented him from lifting\n\nin excess of fifty pounds.\n\n              The defendants did not respond to the complaint and were\n\ntherefore defaulted.         Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(e), a judgment by\n\ndefault may not enter against the United States unless the claimant\n\nestablishes a right to relief by evidence satisfactory to the\n\ncourt.   In accord with this rule, the district court held a trial\n\nto   determine     whether    the   plaintiff   could   establish    an    ADA\n\nviolation.\n\n              While recognizing that, as this case was postured, \"the\n\nquantum and quality of evidence that might satisfy a court can be\n\nless   than    normally   required,\"    the   court   determined    that   the\n\nplaintiffs had nevertheless failed to establish an ADA violation.\n\nSee Camacho-Rodríguez v. Potter, No. 04-1193, slip op. at 5 (D.P.R.\n\nDec. 5, 2003) (quoting Alameda v. Sec'y of Health Ed. and Welfare,\n\n622 F.2d 1044, 1048 (1st Cir. 1980)).         The court found that Camacho\n\nwas not disabled under the ADA because the plaintiffs did not\n\ndemonstrate that Camacho's back condition substantially limited the\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fmajor life activities of lifting or working.         See id. at 10.       As\n\nto lifting, the court concluded that the plaintiffs had produced\n\nevidence of Camacho's lifting limitation at work but did not show\n\nthat his inability to lift was so severe that it substantially\n\nlimited his ability to lift outside the parameters of his job.\n\nSee id. at 9.       As to working, the court concluded that the\n\nplaintiffs had shown that Camacho was unable to perform his job as\n\na letter carrier but did not prove that Camacho was precluded from\n\nperforming a class of jobs because of his back condition.             See id.\n\nat 10.\n\n          We    have   considered    the    plaintiffs'      arguments   for\n\noverturning the district court's ruling and reviewed the entire\n\nrecord.   The district court did not err in concluding that the\n\nplaintiffs failed to establish that Camacho suffered a disability\n\nunder the ADA.    We have no cause to add to the district court's\n\nwell-reasoned opinion and therefore affirm substantially on the\n\ngrounds stated therein.        See Corrada Betances v. Sea-Land Serv.\n\nInc., 248 F.3d 40, 43 (1st Cir. 2001) (\"Where, as here, a trial\n\njudge astutely takes the measure of a case and hands down a\n\nconvincing,    well-reasoned    decision,   an   appellate    court   should\n\nrefrain from writing at length to no other end than to hear its own\n\nwords resonate.\").\n\n          In addition to challenging the district court's ruling on\n\nthe merits, the plaintiffs contend that the district court abused\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fits discretion by denying them a continuance so that one of\n\nCamacho's treating physicians could testify.      The plaintiffs did\n\nnot subpoena the physician and, on the day of trial, the physician\n\ndid not appear.   The plaintiffs requested a continuance which the\n\ncourt granted until the next day.       The physician again did not\n\nappear. The court permitted Camacho to testify concerning his care\n\nby the physician and allowed the plaintiffs to submit certain\n\ndocumentary medical information.      The court asked the plaintiffs'\n\ncounsel if this evidence was a sufficient substitute for the\n\nphysician's testimony.   He responded that it was and that the case\n\ncould be submitted for decision.\n\n          The plaintiffs have waived any argument concerning the\n\nfailure of the physician to testify.     The plaintiffs agreed to the\n\ncourt's alternate procedure for introducing the necessary evidence\n\nand told the court that they were satisfied.     After affirmatively\n\napproving the court's handling of the physician's absence, they\n\ncannot now complain that they were prejudiced by the court's\n\ndecision not to grant a further continuance so that they could\n\nsecure the physician's presence at trial.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -4-\n\f",
