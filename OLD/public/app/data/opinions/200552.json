In Rochester Lincoln-Mercury v. Ford Motor\n\nCo., 248 F.3d 46 (1st Cir. 2001), we concluded that N.H. Rev. Stat.\n\nAnn. § 357-C:3, I (prohibiting motor vehicle manufacturers from,\n\ninter alia, engaging \"in any action which is arbitrary, in bad\n\nfaith, or unconscionable and which causes damage to any [motor\n\nvehicle dealer]\") does not provide a motor vehicle franchisee a\n\ncause of action against a manufacturer for unfairly denying it an\n\nadditional    franchise.      See   id.    at    47-48.      In    reaching   this\n\nconclusion,    we   clarified   that      the   statute     protects   only    the\n\ndealer's existing franchise.        Id. (applying Roberts v. Gen. Motors\n\nCorp., 643 A.2d 956, 958-59 (N.H. 1994) and emphasizing that the\n\nstatute's enforcement provision, N.H. Rev. Stat.

Stat. Ann. § 357-C:3, I because it harmed Depot with respect\n\nto its existing \"business or property.\" American Honda removed the\n\naction to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction and\n\neventually secured summary judgment.   In ruling for Honda on the\n\nstatutory claim, the district court concluded that Depot's alleged\n\nreliance upon conduct by Pugh and Nicholson was unjustifiable\n\nbecause there existed in Depot's franchise agreement with American\n\nHonda a provision stating that only a few, specified American Honda\n\nofficers (not including Pugh or Nicholson) were capable of making\n\npromises and commitments that would bind the manufacturer.       This\n\nprovision, in the court's view, put Depot on notice that it acted\n\nat its own peril in relying upon Pugh or Nicholson.   Depot appeals,\n\nframing the issue presented as follows:\n\n          May Depot's franchise agreement, which provides that\n     no employee of American Honda, other than certain senior\n     officers of the corporation, \"may make any promise or\n     commitment on behalf of American Honda or in any way bind\n     American Honda\" and that \"[d]ealer agrees that it will\n     not rely on any statements or purported statements except\n     from\" these top [American] Honda officers, preclude\n     Depot's claims under the New Hampshire Dealer Protection\n     Statute . . . where that Statute specifically forbids a\n     manufacturer-franchisor from limiting its statutory\n     liability in its franchise agreements?\n\nBrief for Appellant at vii.\n\n          The issue of New Hampshire law that Depot has raised is\n\n\n                               -3-\n\finteresting and potentially difficult, but it is not one that we\n\nwill decide in this appeal (or certify to the New Hampshire Supreme\n\nCourt, as Depot alternatively requests).          We are free to affirm on\n\nany   ground    revealed   by   the   record,    e.g.,   Houlton   Citizens'\n\nCoalition v. Town of Houlton, 175 F.3d 178, 184 (1st Cir. 1999),\n\nand here perceive a considerably more straightforward basis for\n\nupholding      the   district   court's     judgment.     The   conduct   and\n\nstatements of Pugh and Nicholson, when evaluated in an appropriate\n\nfactual context, simply cannot give rise to liability under N.H.\n\nRev. Stat. Ann. § 357-C:3, I even if they were imputed to American\n\nHonda.    We briefly explain.\n\n            Depot is and since 1994 has been located in the town of\n\nRye, in Rockingham County, New Hampshire.           Depot's agreement with\n\nAmerican Honda gives it a nonexclusive right to buy Honda products\n\nand to advertise itself as a Honda dealer.               The agreement also\n\nreserves to American Honda the right to appoint other authorized\n\nHonda dealers wherever it deems appropriate (except as limited by\n\nlaw). In 1996, Dover Honda, a motorcycle dealership located in the\n\nnearby town of Somersworth, in Strafford County, New Hampshire,\n\nceased operations.      Following Dover Honda's closure, Depot was the\n\ndealer closest to Strafford County.          In January 1997, Pugh offered\n\nMailloux a six-month period for Depot to recoup Dover Honda's sales\n\nand to help American Honda achieve 30% market share in Strafford\n\nCounty.     Depot fell well short of achieving the market share\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fAmerican Honda sought within the six-month period or at any time\n\nthereafter.\n\n              The conduct underlying Depot's statutory violation claim\n\nbegan    sometime    prior    to   August     1997   (when   the   six-month\n\nprobationary period expired) and continued throughout 1998.              As\n\nsummarized by Depot, it included (1) Pugh recruiting one Paul\n\nGladstone, who lacked motorcycle sales experience but employed\n\nPugh's then-girlfriend, to open a new Strafford County dealership\n\nprior to the expiration of the six-month period during which Depot\n\nwas attempting to recoup Dover Honda's sales (and was concomitantly\n\ninvesting in its facility and inventory to facilitate its efforts);\n\n(2) Pugh informing Mailloux in October 1997 (after sending an\n\napplication to Gladstone) that American Honda would be establishing\n\nan \"open point,\" or location for a potential new dealership, in the\n\nStrafford County town of Rochester, New Hampshire, but assuring\n\nMailloux that the open point would not be filled at that time and\n\nthat he would speak to her and permit her to apply before awarding\n\nthe dealership to another; (3) American Honda (apparently acting at\n\nthe behest of Pugh) sending a second application for the Rochester\n\nopen point to one Miles Cook, a friend of Pugh's, in February 1998\n\nwithout informing Mailloux; (4) American Honda (again, apparently\n\nacting   at    the   behest   of   Pugh)    tentatively   approving   Cook's\n\napplication in June 1998 (and subsequently extending deadlines by\n\nwhich he was to complete construction of the dealership until\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fFebruary   1,   1999)   without   informing   Mailloux;   (5)   Pugh   and\n\nNicholson refusing to allow Mailloux to apply for the dealership\n\nafter she learned in December 1998 that the Rochester open point\n\nwas in the process of being filled by Cook; and (6) Pugh and\n\nNicholson conjuring an untruthful excuse for deterring Mailloux's\n\napplication -- that American Honda had a policy on not allowing a\n\nsingle dealer to have two contiguous markets.             See Brief for\n\nAppellant at 18-19.\n\n           While these allegations, which we credit for summary\n\njudgment purposes, certainly do not reflect well on Pugh and\n\nNicholson, we are at a loss to see how they describe \"action which\n\n[was] arbitrary, in bad faith, or unconscionable and which cause[d]\n\ndamage to [Depot] . . . .\"        N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 357-C:12, I\n\n(emphasis supplied). Depot's submissions have been extraordinarily\n\nvague on damage and causation, but a review of the record suggests\n\nan intention to argue that the challenged conduct harmed the Depot\n\nfranchise by causing it to invest in its facility and to grow its\n\ninventory so as to serve the Strafford County market, and/or by\n\ncausing it to lose sales to the new Rochester dealership.*        Yet no\n\nreasonable fact-finder could fairly link either source of \"damage\"\n\nto the allegedly unlawful conduct.\n\n\n\n     *\n      Rochester Lincoln-Mercury precludes any claim under the\nstatute for damage arising out of Depot's failure to secure the\nRochester dealership. See 248 F.3d at 47-48.\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\f            Because Depot's franchise agreement is both nonexclusive\n\nand expressly reserves to American Honda the right to appoint\n\nadditional dealers wherever it deems appropriate, the harms Depot\n\nsuffered in attempting to serve the Strafford County market and in\n\nlosing sales to the Rochester dealership cannot be considered to\n\nhave     been   wrongly    inflicted      by       American   Honda   unless    the\n\nmanufacturer     was   somehow    bound      by    an   extra-contractual      legal\n\nobligation to forswear appointing a dealer to rival Depot in the\n\nStrafford County market.         The only such obligation even suggested\n\nby the record was the January 1997 commitment to permit Depot to\n\nservice Strafford County without competition from a dealership\n\nreplacing Dover Honda.         But this commitment extended only through\n\nAugust 1997, and was explicitly conditioned on Depot helping\n\nAmerican Honda achieve a 30% market share.                      And as we have\n\nobserved, Depot never came close to obtaining the specified market\n\nshare.     Nor did American Honda establish a competing dealership\n\nuntil    approximately     a   year    and     a    half   after   the   six-month\n\nprobationary period expired.          The evidence thus does not allow for\n\na finding that American Honda breached the commitment it made to\n\nDepot in January 1997.\n\n            That leaves only the evidence that Pugh committed to\n\ntalking with Mailloux before American Honda awarded the dealership\n\nto another. But this evidence simply cannot support a damage award\n\nunder the statute.        First, Pugh's commitment was temporally vague\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fand   arguably   not   even   breached    because   Mailloux   undisputedly\n\nlearned of American Honda's plans to fill the Rochester open point\n\nseveral months before the actual establishment of the Rochester\n\ndealership.      Second, the record is bereft of evidence that any\n\ninvestments in facility and/or inventory made in reliance on Pugh's\n\npost-August 1997 failure to be upfront with Mailloux -- the only of\n\nDepot's two damage theories potentially impacted by Pugh's silence\n\n-- caused Depot economic harm.\n\n           Affirmed.    Costs to appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\f",

Depot's submissions have been extraordinarily\n\nvague on damage and causation, but a review of the record suggests\n\nan intention to argue that the challenged conduct harmed the Depot\n\nfranchise by causing it to invest in its facility and to grow its\n\ninventory so as to serve the Strafford County market, and/or by\n\ncausing it to lose sales to the new Rochester dealership.*        Yet no\n\nreasonable fact-finder could fairly link either source of \"damage\"\n\nto the allegedly unlawful conduct.\n\n\n\n     *\n      Rochester Lincoln-Mercury precludes any claim under the\nstatute for damage arising out of Depot's failure to secure the\nRochester dealership. See 248 F.3d at 47-48.\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\f            Because Depot's franchise agreement is both nonexclusive\n\nand expressly reserves to American Honda the right to appoint\n\nadditional dealers wherever it deems appropriate, the harms Depot\n\nsuffered in attempting to serve the Strafford County market and in\n\nlosing sales to the Rochester dealership cannot be considered to\n\nhave     been   wrongly    inflicted      by       American   Honda   unless    the\n\nmanufacturer     was   somehow    bound      by    an   extra-contractual      legal\n\nobligation to forswear appointing a dealer to rival Depot in the\n\nStrafford County market.         The only such obligation even suggested\n\nby the record was the January 1997 commitment to permit Depot to\n\nservice Strafford County without competition from a dealership\n\nreplacing Dover Honda.         But this commitment extended only through\n\nAugust 1997, and was explicitly conditioned on Depot helping\n\nAmerican Honda achieve a 30% market share.                      And as we have\n\nobserved, Depot never came close to obtaining the specified market\n\nshare.     Nor did American Honda establish a competing dealership\n\nuntil    approximately     a   year    and     a    half   after   the   six-month\n\nprobationary period expired.          The evidence thus does not allow for\n\na finding that American Honda breached the commitment it made to\n\nDepot in January 1997.\n\n            That leaves only the evidence that Pugh committed to\n\ntalking with Mailloux before American Honda awarded the dealership\n\nto another. But this evidence simply cannot support a damage award\n\nunder the statute.        First, Pugh's commitment was temporally vague\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fand   arguably   not   even   breached    because   Mailloux   undisputedly\n\nlearned of American Honda's plans to fill the Rochester open point\n\nseveral months before the actual establishment of the Rochester\n\ndealership.      Second, the record is bereft of evidence that any\n\ninvestments in facility and/or inventory made in reliance on Pugh's\n\npost-August 1997 failure to be upfront with Mailloux -- the only of\n\nDepot's two damage theories potentially impacted by Pugh's silence\n\n-- caused Depot economic harm.\n\n           Affirmed.    Costs to appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\f</pre>",
