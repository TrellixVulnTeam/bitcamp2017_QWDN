This appeal leads us into the\n\noften surreal world of Medicare administration.      It arises out of\n\nefforts by South Shore Hospital (the Hospital), an acute care\n\nhospital located in South Weymouth, Massachusetts, to obtain relief\n\nfor its transitional care center (the TCC) from Medicare's cost\n\nlimits on reimbursement of routine patient care expenses.         The\n\nHealth Care Financing Administration (HCFA) denied the Hospital's\n\napplication on the ground that its purchase of determination of\n\nneed (DON) rights from an unaffiliated nursing home rendered\n\nunavailable the so-called \"new provider\" exemption codified at 42\n\nC.F.R. § 413.30(e)(2) (1994).1    The Provider Reimbursement Review\n\nBoard (the Board) of the United States Department of Health and\n\nHuman Services (HHS) affirmed this determination.        See S. Shore\n\nHosp., No. 99-D38, 1999 WL 297452 (PRRB Apr. 21, 1999) (S. Shore\n\nI).   The federal district court, however, took a different view,\n\nreversing the Board's decision. S. Shore Hosp. v. Thompson, 204 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 76, 83 (D. Mass. 2002)   (S. Shore II).    This timely appeal\n\nensued.\n\n          We conclude that the new provider exemption is less than\n\npellucid; that the Secretary's interpretation of the relevant\n\n\n      1\n      Although the new provider exemption lately has migrated,\nafter certain amendments not relevant here, to 42 C.F.R. §\n413.30(d) (2000), the previous version of the rule was in effect at\nall times material hereto, and we will continue to refer to that\nversion.   By like token, even though HCFA is now known as the\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services, we will continue to use\nthe original acronym.\n\n                                  -2-\n\fregulatory language is reasonable (although not inevitable); that\n\nthe Hospital has failed to show that the Secretary vacillated in\n\nhis interpretation; and that substantial evidence supports the\n\nBoard's finding that the now-defunct nursing home from which the\n\nHospital    acquired     the    necessary     DON    rights    operated    as    an\n\nequivalent of the TCC.         Consequently, we sustain the Secretary's\n\nrefusal to classify the TCC as a new provider, reverse the decision\n\nof the district court, and direct the entry of judgment in favor of\n\nthe Secretary.\n\nI.   STATUTORY AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK\n\n             The Medicare Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1395-1395ggg, provides\n\nfederal funding for a range of medical services for the elderly and\n\ndisabled,    including      reimbursement     for    the   reasonable     cost    of\n\ncertain services provided by skilled nursing facilities (SNFs).\n\nId. § 1395f(b)(1); 42 C.F.R. § 413.1(a)(2)(ii), (b), (g).                 The Act\n\nexpressly vests in the Secretary of HHS the discretion to determine\n\nreasonable costs by regulations that, inter alia, \"may provide for\n\nthe establishment of limits on the [costs] to be recognized as\n\nreasonable    based    on   estimates    of   the    costs    necessary    in    the\n\nefficient    delivery    of    needed   health      services.\"     42   U.S.C.     §\n\n1395x(v)(1)(A).       In this regard, the Act mandates routine cost\n\nlimits (RCLs) that restrict per diem reimbursement to 112% of the\n\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fnational    average   for   similarly    situated     providers.2   Id.   §\n\n1395yy(a).    Exemptions and exceptions that permit higher rates of\n\nreimbursement are allowed \"to the extent the Secretary deems\n\nappropriate, based upon case mix or circumstances beyond the\n\ncontrol of the facility.\"      Id. § 1395yy(c).\n\n            At issue here is an exemption for \"new providers\" of\n\nskilled nursing services. 42 C.F.R. § 413.30(e)(2). The Secretary\n\npromulgated this exemptive regulation in 1979 to ameliorate the\n\n\"initial underutilization\" faced by many market entrants.           44 Fed.\n\nReg. 31,802.     It authorizes an exemption when \"[t]he provider of\n\ninpatient services has operated as the type of provider (or the\n\nequivalent) for which it is certified for Medicare, under present\n\nand previous ownership, for less than three full years.\" 42 C.F.R.\n\n§ 413.30(e)(2).       This, then, permits the Secretary, under some\n\ncircumstances, to deny the exemption by tying together present and\n\nprevious ownership.\n\n             Although this phraseology makes previous ownership an\n\nimportant datum, the regulation does not dictate how previous\n\nownership    determinations   should     be   made.    The   Secretary   has\n\ninterpreted this phrase, more majorum, by reference to Part I of\n\nHCFA's Provider Reimbursement Manual (the Manual).            Pertinently,\n\n\n     2\n      Routine service costs include those costs, such as room and\nboard, basic medical supplies, ordinary dietary and nursing\nservices, and other quotidian expenses, for which an institution\ntypically would assess a single per diem service charge. 42 C.F.R.\n§ 413.53(b).\n\n                                   -4-\n\fthe Manual has long defined \"change of ownership\" as including the\n\nsale of \"all or some portion of a provider's facility or assets\n\n(used to render patient care),\" so long as such sale \"affects\n\nlicensure or certification of the provider entity.\" PRM-1 § 1500.7\n\n(1976).     The Manual eventually integrated change of ownership, so\n\ndefined, into determinations of previous ownership and, ultimately,\n\ninto the definition of new provider.               See id. § 2533.1.E.1.b\n\n(1997). It warns, however, that \"[t]he mere existence of a [change\n\nof    ownership]    does    not    in   itself   make   an   institution   or\n\ninstitutional complex eligible for a new provider exemption.\"              Id.\n\n§ 2533.1.E.     Rather, the Secretary conducts a comparison of the\n\noperations conducted by the previous and current owners in order to\n\ndecide whether the current owner qualifies.             Equivalency plays an\n\nimportant    role   in     this   comparison,    for,   generally   speaking,\n\nprevious ownership will not be carried forward unless, at a bare\n\nminimum, the previous owner's operations and the current owner's\n\noperations are deemed equivalent.\n\nII.   PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n            The Hospital began to plan for the TCC in 1992, with an\n\neye toward supplementing its existing continuum of care. But there\n\nwas a rub: Massachusetts, like many states, titrates the provision\n\nof health care by requiring various types of facilities to secure\n\ndeterminations of need as a prerequisite to offering covered\n\n\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fservices.3      See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111, § 25C; Mass. Regs. Code\n\ntit. 105, § 100.352. Because Massachusetts had placed a moratorium\n\non the issuance of DON rights for skilled nursing beds, the\n\nHospital's plans were stymied until it arranged to purchase the\n\nnecessary    DON     rights    from   Prospect   Hill   Manor    Nursing     Home\n\n(Prospect Hill), a facility that had gone into receivership in\n\nMarch 1993.      No other transfers of property, patient records, or\n\nassets accompanied the purchase, and the entity known as Prospect\n\nHill vanished shortly after transferring the DON rights.\n\n             The Commonwealth of Massachusetts approved the transfer\n\nof DON rights on condition that the Hospital assume liability for\n\nany and all Medicaid overpayments to Prospect Hill.              Subsequently,\n\nit   approved    a   phantom    \"relocation\"     of   Prospect   Hill   to     the\n\nHospital's campus.      Armed with these approvals, the TCC opened its\n\ndoors in January of 1995.\n\n             On May 17, 1995, the Hospital petitioned HCFA to classify\n\nits nascent TCC as a new provider.               The Hospital's continuing\n\ninterest in the exemption is easily grasped:             in 1995 — its first\n\nfull year of operation — the TCC's routine service costs exceeded\n\nthe applicable RCLs by almost $900,000. And when Congress replaced\n\nMedicare's      existing      cost-based     reimbursement   system     with     a\n\n\n\n      3\n      What Massachusetts calls determination of need rights are\nknown elsewhere as certificate of need (CON) rights. See, e.g.,\nR.I. Gen. Laws § 23-15-1 to -10 (2001).    We use the two terms\ninterchangeably.\n\n                                       -6-\n\fprospective     payment     system     that     looked   to    a    facility's      1995\n\nreimbursement levels as a basis for setting future rates, see\n\nBalanced Budget Act of 1997, Pub. L. No. 105-33, § 4432(a), 111\n\nStat.   251,       422     (codified      as     amended       at    42     U.S.C.     §\n\n1395yy(e)(3)(A)(ii)), the lure of the new provider exemption became\n\nirresistible.\n\n            In due course, HCFA rejected the Hospital's application\n\non the ground that the conveyance of DON rights required that\n\nProspect    Hill's       previous    operations     be     imputed     to    the    TCC.\n\nFollowing     an    evidentiary        hearing,    the     Board     affirmed       this\n\ndetermination.       S. Shore I, supra, at *18.                In so holding, the\n\nBoard   found      that,    in   the    circumstances         of    this    case,    the\n\ntransferred DON rights were a sufficient basis for imputation of\n\nprevious ownership to the purchaser and that Prospect Hill and the\n\nTCC were equivalent providers.                 Id. at *16-*17.         In regard to\n\nequivalency the Board acknowledged that Prospect Hill had not\n\nfurnished the same level of nursing care that characterized the\n\noperations of the TCC, but nonetheless concluded that Prospect Hill\n\nhad been operating as an SNF during the three years prior to the\n\nconveyance. Id. at *17. The Secretary declined to intervene, thus\n\nmaking the Board's decision administratively final.                        42 U.S.C. §\n\n1395oo(f)(1).\n\n            The Hospital petitioned for judicial review.                      See id.\n\nThe district court reversed, declaring that the TCC was a new\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fprovider in every relevant sense and that the Board could not\n\nreasonably have ruled otherwise.            S. Shore II, 204 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n82.    Accordingly, the court remanded the matter to the Board for a\n\ndetermination of what level of reimbursement the TCC, as a new\n\nprovider, should receive.         Id. at 83.    This appeal followed.\n\nIII.    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n            An inquiring court can set aside an agency's adjudicatory\n\ndecisions only if those decisions are \"arbitrary, capricious, an\n\nabuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,\" 5\n\nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A), or \"unsupported by substantial evidence in the\n\nadministrative record,\" id. § 706(2)(E).             This standard tightly\n\ncircumscribes judicial review.         See Citizens to Preserve Overton\n\nPark, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 415-16 (1971); Henry v. INS, 74\n\nF.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n            Here,   there    is   a   further    gloss   on    this   familiar\n\nformulation.        Where   Congress    has     entrusted     rulemaking   and\n\nadministrative authority to an agency, courts normally accord the\n\nagency particular deference in respect to the interpretation of\n\nregulations promulgated under that authority.            Bowles v. Seminole\n\nRock & Sand Co., 325 U.S. 410, 414 (1945); Johnson v. Watts\n\nRegulator Co., 63 F.3d 1129, 1134-35 (1st Cir. 1995).                  Courts\n\nwithhold such deference only when the agency's interpretation of\n\nits regulation is \"plainly erroneous or inconsistent with\" its\n\nlanguage.    Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala, 512 U.S. 504, 512\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\f(1994). This deference is at its apex when, as in this instance, a\n\nregulation concerns \"a complex and highly technical regulatory\n\nprogram in which the identification and classification of relevant\n\ncriteria necessarily require significant expertise and entail the\n\nexercise of judgment grounded in policy concerns.\"             Id. (citation\n\nand internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n          Both the district court and the court of appeals are\n\nbound by these principles.            Therefore, we review the district\n\ncourt's resolution of such a case de novo, applying essentially the\n\nsame standards as pertained in that court.             Assoc. Fisheries of\n\nMe., Inc. v. Daley, 127 F.3d 104, 109 (1st Cir. 1997); Mass. DPW v.\n\nSec'y of Agric., 984 F.2d 514, 520 (1st Cir. 1993).                  That the\n\nparties brought the issues forward on cross-motions for summary\n\njudgment is not significant; substance must prevail over form, and\n\nthe fact remains that the parties have presented this matter as a\n\ncase stated, on a fully developed administrative record.                     Our\n\nreview proceeds accordingly.\n\nIV.   ANALYSIS\n\n           We    turn     now   to    the    Secretary's   construction      and\n\napplication      of     the   new    provider    exemption,   42    C.F.R.    §\n\n413.30(e)(2).         Our analysis proceeds in three steps.         First, we\n\ndiscuss the reasonableness of the Secretary's interpretation of the\n\nexemption.      Second, we address the Hospital's related claim that\n\nthe Secretary has applied the regulation willy-nilly.              Finally, we\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fscrutinize the Board's finding that Prospect Hill and the TCC were\n\nequivalent providers.\n\n               A.   Interpretation of the Exemption.\n\n           Despite the fact that Medicare rules fall squarely within\n\nthe   Secretary's   domain,    deference    is   due    to   the   Secretary's\n\ninterpretation of a particular regulation only when the language of\n\nthe regulation either (1) compels that interpretation or (2) admits\n\nof differing interpretations, and the Secretary chooses reasonably\n\namong them.    Christensen v. Harris County, 529 U.S. 576, 588\n\n(2000); Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467\n\nU.S. 837, 842-43 (1984).       Here, the Hospital's main argument is\n\nthat the new provider exemption is unambiguous and demands an\n\ninterpretation at odds with the Secretary's rendition.\n\n           We find the new provider provision vague (and, therefore,\n\nmanifestly ambiguous).        This case hinges on the meaning of the\n\nphrase \"previous    ownership,\"    and     section     413.30(e)(2)   neither\n\ndefines nor explains that phrase. To complicate matters, the terms\n\n\"provider\" and \"institution\" are central to an understanding of the\n\nexemption, and those terms subsume any number of components,\n\nchanges in one or all of which might, depending on the context,\n\nlead one to deduce that a new provider has (or has not) been\n\ncreated.   Because the regulation is not drawn in blacks and whites\n\nbut leaves significant gray areas unresolved, it is ambiguous. See\n\nParagon Health Network, Inc. v. Thompson, 251 F.3d 1141, 1148 (7th\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fCir. 2001) (discussing the same regulation and reaching the same\n\nconclusion).\n\n            To state the obvious, the fact that the regulation is\n\nambiguous means that some interpretation is inevitable.                   The\n\nquestion reduces, therefore, to whether using the transfer of DON\n\nrights as a basis for ascribing Prospect Hill's operations to the\n\nHospital    comes    within    a     reasonable   interpretation     of   the\n\nregulation.      We think that this question must be answered in the\n\naffirmative.\n\n            In this case, the Secretary relied on section 1500.7 of\n\nthe Manual for guidance.        Noting that Prospect Hill's DON rights\n\nwere virtually the only assets it owned              at the time of the\n\ntransfer, he determined that the sale of the rights qualified as a\n\npurchase of assets affecting licensure or certification (and,\n\ntherefore, constituted a change of ownership).          S. Shore I, supra,\n\nat *13.    In this connection, the Secretary explained that there\n\nneed not    be   a   high   degree   of   operational   continuity   between\n\nproviders in order for the operation of one to be imputed to the\n\nother.    Following this train of thought and citing section 2604.1\n\nof the Manual, the Secretary determined that the relocation of beds\n\nfrom Prospect Hill to the TCC did not substantially change the\n\npopulation served or the number of inpatient days accumulated. Id.\n\nat *15.    Concomitantly, the Secretary \"looked back\" at Prospect\n\nHill's operational history and determined that it had functioned as\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fthe equivalent of an SNF during the previous three years because it\n\nhad furnished some skilled nursing rehabilitation services, as\n\nidentified in 42 C.F.R. § 409.33(b) and (c).            S. Shore I, supra, at\n\n*14.       Accordingly, he denied the Hospital's application for a new\n\nprovider exemption.\n\n               The Hospital, ably represented, attempts to discredit the\n\nSecretary's      reasoning      in   several    different   ways.   First,   it\n\nemphasizes the genesis of the change of ownership definition\n\ncontained      in   PRM-1   §   1500.7    (which   originally   addressed    the\n\nobligations of facilities leaving the Medicare program) and argues\n\nthat the Secretary arbitrarily applied this definition to the new\n\nprovider exemption.         But the Secretary, through HCFA, historically\n\nhas defined change of ownership differently in different contexts,4\n\nand we see no reason why the Secretary, in the exercise of his\n\nbroad authority to interpret regulations that he himself has\n\npromulgated, cannot choose to apply section 1500.7's dilucidation\n\nin this context, regardless of the provision's origins.\n\n               The Hospital also argues that a transfer of DON rights\n\nalone cannot constitute a continuation of ownership for purposes of\n\nthis case because Prospect Hill closed its doors for unrelated\n\n\n       4\n      To cite one example, HCFA has regarded a transfer of\ncorporate stock as a change of ownership for some purposes but not\nfor others. See Las Encinas Hosp., No. 95-0303, 1998 WL 611452\n(PRRB Sept. 11, 1998). To cite another, HCFA defines changes of\nownership for Medicare certification purposes differently than for\nMedicare payment purposes. See N. Fla. Physical Therapy Serv., No.\n98-D10, 1998 WL 119693 (HCFA Feb. 3, 1998).\n\n                                         -12-\n\freasons (and, thus, the transfer did not contribute to the loss of\n\nits licensure and certification).                 The district court found merit\n\nin this argument, see S. Shore II, 204 F. Supp. 2d at 81-82, but we\n\ndo not.     Fairly read, section 1500.7 requires only that the\n\ntransfer \"affect\" licensure or certification, not that it be the\n\ndispositive factor.       Here, the DON rights were a sine qua non for\n\nthe operation of a nursing home (whether Prospect Hill or the TCC)\n\n— and the handsome price that the Hospital paid for them (which\n\nappears to have been in the range of $125,000 - $150,000) attests\n\nto their materiality.              We cannot say that the Secretary acted\n\nunreasonably in rejecting the conceit that the significance of DON\n\nrights should be measured solely by the happenstance of when the\n\noriginal owner of the rights went out of business.\n\n           In a related vein, we question the emphasis placed by the\n\nlower court on the fact that Prospect Hill's DON rights were out of\n\ncirculation at the time of the purchase.                      See id. at 82.       The\n\ncourt's    implication        is    that     Medicare     ought   to    spend     more\n\nreimbursement       dollars    for    routine       service    costs    because    the\n\nHospital has \"rescued\" these dormant beds from the scrap heap. Id.\n\nEven if we credit the district court's characterization of the\n\nHospital   as   a    rescuer,       however,       that   would   not   impugn     the\n\nSecretary's discretionary decision to treat all purchasers of DON\n\nrights alike. See Arkansas v. Oklahoma, 503 U.S. 91, 113-14 (1992)\n\n(affirming that, within wide limits, agencies may decide for\n\n\n                                           -13-\n\fthemselves what factors pertain to their decisionmaking).                       The\n\nSecretary's vision of the transfer as simply relocating the beds in\n\nquestion is not impermissible.\n\n            This     reasoning      also        defeats       the      Hospital's\n\n\"fragmentation\" argument, in which it points out that a previous\n\nowner may sell its DON rights to one party, its site to a second\n\nparty, and a third pivotal asset (say, its equipment) to yet\n\nanother party. According to the Hospital, this threatens to create\n\na situation where one previous owner can spawn a multitude of\n\nsuccessors, none of whom will be regarded as a new provider.\n\n            Unlike   the   Hospital,       we    find    this    result    to    be\n\nacceptable.    After all, we would not hesitate to use the term\n\n\"previous   ownership\"     in   reference       to   three   100-bed    hospitals\n\nresulting from the split of a single 300-bed facility.                    Cf. Md.\n\nGen. Hosp., Inc. v. Thompson, 155 F. Supp. 2d 459, 462-65 (D. Md.\n\n2001) (finding that \"previous ownership\" precluded a new provider\n\nexemption when a nascent facility bought CON rights from three\n\ndifferent institutions).        Consequently, the fragmentation argument\n\nfails.\n\n            The Hospital next asserts that its actions were guided by\n\nthe plain meaning of the regulation and that \"[a]ny contrary\n\ninterpretation of the regulation would require a gross distortion\n\nof the English language.\"        Appellee's Br. at 38.          This approach is\n\ndoubly flawed.       In the first place, it overlooks the patent\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fambiguity of the regulation.          In the second place, accepting it\n\nwould make a mockery of the deference due to the Secretary's\n\ninterpretation of his own regulations.             As the Hospital itself\n\nacknowledges, change of ownership is a term of art in the Medicare\n\ncontext.     As such, interpretation of the term lies peculiarly\n\nwithin the compass of the Secretary's expertise.                     See Thomas\n\nJefferson, 512 U.S. at 512; Pauley v. BethEnergy Mines, Inc., 501\n\nU.S. 680, 697 (1991).\n\n            In a variation on this theme, the Hospital maintains that\n\nthe   Secretary's   interpretation      of   the   new    provider    exemption\n\noppugns the underlying policy of the exemption when applied to\n\nstates, such as Massachusetts, that have imposed moratoria on new\n\nnursing home beds.      As the Seventh Circuit explained, however,\n\nmoratoria on DON rights effectively limit the number of permitted\n\nbeds and thus reduce competition among such facilities.                Paragon,\n\n251 F.3d at 1150.       This means that any given facility in a\n\nmoratorium state will be less likely to experience and sustain a\n\nhigh vacancy rate during its early years.                Consequently, new or\n\nexpanded facilities in moratorium states have less need for special\n\nswaddling     to    prevent     the     financial        drain   of     initial\n\nunderutilization.     See id.\n\n            The district court attempted to distinguish Paragon as a\n\nchange of ownership between related corporations. S. Shore II, 204\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 81.        But the court never explained how this\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\fcircumstance compromised the underlying policy of the new provider\n\nexemption.     Insofar as we can discern, relationship through a\n\ncommon corporate parent will have little effect on whether the\n\ntransfer of DON rights does (or does not) ameliorate a facility's\n\ninitial underutilization.      Once that is understood, there is no\n\nprincipled reason why the facility discussed in Paragon should have\n\nany diminished claim to improved reimbursement by virtue of being\n\na related subsidiary.5\n\n             In a further endeavor to blunt the force of Paragon, the\n\nHospital notes that the language of the regulation at issue does\n\nnot distinguish between facilities in states with and without\n\nmoratoria.       For   this   reason,   it   muses,   the   Secretary's\n\ninterpretation inevitably will lead to non-uniformity.       Relatedly,\n\n\n\n     5\n      The Hospital has called to our attention through successive\npost-argument letters, see Fed. R. App. P. 28(j); 1st Cir. R.\n28(j), the recent decisions in Mercy Med. SNF v. Mut. of Omaha Ins.\nCo., No. 97-0135, 2002 WL 1906219 (PRRB Aug. 7, 2002), and\nPeninsula Reg'l Med. Ctr. v. BCBS Assoc., No. 97-2659, 2002 WL ___\n(PRRB Sept. 27, 2002). In both instances the Board, relying in\nlarge part on the district court's opinion in this case, rejected\nthe Secretary's interpretation of the new provider exemption.\nMercy Med., supra, at *17; Peninsula Reg'l, supra, at *__. As the\ndissent in Mercy Med. observed, however, six PRRB decisions, eight\nreported HCFA determinations, five district court opinions, and a\ncourt of appeals opinion (Paragon) all have upheld the Secretary's\ninterpretation of the new provider exemption. Mercy Med., supra,\nat *19 (dissenting op.). Moreover, the Board recently granted the\nSecretary's   motion   to   reconsider   Mercy   Med.,   and   that\nreconsideration   is   presently   underway.      (The   time   for\nreconsideration has not yet run in Peninsula.) Given this mise-en-\nscène, we regard these decisions as founded upon a mistaken legal\ninterpretation and, therefore, entitled to little weight. See Good\nSamaritan Hosp. v. Shalala, 508 U.S. 402, 417 (1993).\n\n                                 -16-\n\fit suggests that the Secretary ought to bear the burden of adducing\n\nsufficient evidence or analysis to show that the putative oligopoly\n\neffect in moratorium states will help relieve initial costs.\n\n            In   asserting   these    propositions,       the    Hospital   leans\n\nheavily on the decision in Ashtabula County Med. Ctr. v. Thompson,\n\n191 F. Supp. 2d 884, 895-96 (N.D. Ohio 2002).                     We think that\n\nAshtabula — a case that is currently on appeal to the Sixth Circuit\n\n— erects the wrong decisional framework.                The court's opinion\n\nappears to place the burden on the Secretary to show that his\n\ninterpretation of a regulation is reasonable.             See id.    That is not\n\nthe law.    The burden is on the party challenging the Secretary's\n\nreasoning   to    show   that    it   fails   to   pass    muster     under   the\n\nreasonableness standard.        See Save Our Heritage, Inc. v. FAA, 269\n\nF.3d 49, 60 (1st Cir. 2001); St. Mary of Nazareth Hosp. Ctr. v.\n\nSchweiker, 718 F.2d 459, 466 (D.C. Cir. 1983).                  Hence, it is the\n\nHospital that must show that the Secretary unreasonably relied on\n\nthe oligopoly effect theory.          The Hospital has not done so (and,\n\nindeed, there is evidence in the record suggesting that the TCC did\n\nin fact enjoy a relatively high level of patient utilization from\n\nthe start).\n\n            As to the charge of non-uniformity, it suffices to say\n\nthat discretion, such as that specifically conferred upon the\n\nSecretary   to   establish      limits   on   routine     care    costs,    almost\n\ninvariably involves line-drawing (and, thus, inevitably entails\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\fsome level of variation).        See Sprandel v. Sec'y of HHS, 838 F.2d\n\n23,   27   (1st   Cir.   1988)   (per    curiam)    (observing    that   it   is\n\nimpossible to block out administrative categories that do not\n\n\"chafe at the outer edges\").            We need find only that, from some\n\nplausible standpoint, the Secretary had an organizing primum mobile\n\nsufficient to justify his actions.             The Secretary's proffered\n\noligopoly effect theory passes this test.\n\n            The   Hospital's     rejoinder     is    that   the   Secretary's\n\ninterpretation of section 1500.7 effectively obviates new provider\n\nstatus for many (or even all) \"new\" SNFs within Massachusetts.\n\nEven if true, this lament does not call the Secretary's judgment\n\ninto serious question.       The goal of regulation is not to provide\n\nexact uniformity of treatment, but, rather, to provide uniformity\n\nof rules so that those similarly situated will be treated alike.\n\nIn addition, as the Seventh Circuit suggested, the Secretary\n\nreasonably may have concluded that, in states that have imposed\n\nmoratoria because they no longer need additional nursing beds,\n\nsubsidizing the start-up costs of new SNFs is unnecessary for the\n\nefficient delivery of health-care services.            Paragon, 251 F.3d at\n\n1149.\n\n            To sum up, we find no plausible reason to discredit the\n\nSecretary's rationale that, when one facility purchases another's\n\nDON rights in a moratorium state, lessened competition will enhance\n\ninitial utilization (and, thus, will help defray costs in the\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\ftransferee facility's early years).      On that rationale, it makes\n\nsense, for purposes of construing the new provider exemption, to\n\nattribute the operations of the seller to the acquirer of the DON\n\nrights.    After all, \"[w]hen Congress entrusts an agency with the\n\nresponsibility for drawing lines, and the agency exercises that\n\nauthority in a reasonable way, neither the fact that there are\n\nother possible places at which the line could be drawn nor the fact\n\nthat the administrative scheme might occasionally operate unfairly\n\nfrom a particular participant's perspective is sufficient, standing\n\nalone, to undermine the scheme's legality.\" Mass. DPW, 984 F.2d at\n\n522.      We therefore follow Paragon and uphold the Secretary's\n\ninterpretation of the disputed regulation as against the Hospital's\n\n\"reasonableness\" challenge.\n\n                          B.    Consistency.\n\n            The Hospital has a fallback position:       even if the\n\nSecretary's interpretation of the new provider exemption is not\n\narbitrary and capricious, its thesis runs, his interpretation\n\nflouts prior practice.    The theoretical foundation on which this\n\nposition rests is sound:       if, over time, an agency interprets a\n\nregulation erratically, that inconsistency may warrant a court in\n\ndeclining to defer to the agency in a particular situation.      See\n\nGood Samaritan Hosp. v. Shalala, 508 U.S. 402, 417 (1993); INS v.\n\nCardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 446 n.30 (1987).       In this case,\n\nhowever, the Hospital's thesis fails.\n\n\n                                  -19-\n\f            Once proffered, agency interpretations are not chiseled\n\nin stone.       See    Good Samaritan Hosp., 508 U.S. at 417 (\"An\n\nadministrative agency is not disqualified from changing its mind.\")\n\n(citation omitted). As we have pointed out, \"[e]xperience is often\n\nthe best teacher, and agencies retain a substantial measure of\n\nfreedom to refine, reformulate, and even reverse their precedents\n\nin the light of new insights and changed circumstances.\"                 Davila-\n\nBardales v. INS, 27 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n            This does not mean that an agency may change positions\n\nwith the same ease that an actor changes costumes.             For example, an\n\nagency may not, without rhyme or reason, create conflicting lines\n\nof precedent governing materially identical situations.                  Shaw's\n\nSupermarkets, Inc. v. NLRB, 884 F.2d 34, 36-37 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\nBut an agency may learn from its mistakes and decide to discard one\n\ninterpretation in favor of another, as long as it thereafter\n\nconsistently applies the new interpretation.              See, e.g., Rust v.\n\nSullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 186-87 (1991); Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n v.\n\nState Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 42 (1983).\n\n            The    Hospital    complains    that   the   Secretary   has   only\n\nsporadically denied new provider exemptions to facilities that have\n\nacquired DON rights from other providers.           To support this plaint,\n\nthe Hospital cites a single incident, involving a facility known as\n\nMeridian-Spa Creek, in which HCFA granted a new provider exemption\n\ndespite   the     facility's   use   of   transferred    CON   rights.      This\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\fcitation is unpersuasive.        The incident occurred well before the\n\nTCC applied for its exemption, and it is impossible to tell from\n\nthe scanty record why HCFA granted Meridian-Spa Creek an exemption.\n\n          It is incumbent on a party complaining of inconsistency\n\nin administrative action \"to bring before the reviewing court\n\nsufficient particulars of how the appellant was situated, how the\n\nallegedly favored party was situated, and how such similarities as\n\nmay exist dictate similar treatment and how such dissimilarities as\n\nmay exist are irrelevant or outweighed.\"           P.I.A. Mich. City, Inc.\n\nv. Thompson, 292 F.3d 820, 826 (D.C. Cir. 2002).                While the\n\nHospital speculates that the unexplained grant of an exemption to\n\nMeridian-Spa   Creek   betrays    a    pervasive   inconsistency   in   HCFA\n\ndecisions, it has not supported this conjecture with proof.             Nor\n\nhas the Hospital shown that its circumstances bear a substantial\n\nsimilarity to those of Meridian-Spa Creek in all (or nearly all)\n\nrelevant aspects. Hence, we cannot say that the Meridian-Spa Creek\n\nscenario demonstrates administrative inconsistency.6\n\n\n     6\n      In all events, the Meridian-Spa Creek determination may be no\nmore than a waif in the wilderness. It was not appealed to the\nBoard, much less to the HCFA Administrator or the Secretary. Thus,\nthe determination may well be explained as the decision of a lower-\nlevel agency employee that cannot bind either the Board or the\nSecretary. See Irving v. United States, 162 F.3d 154, 166 (1st\nCir. 1998) (en banc) (\"To determine what is agency policy, courts\ncustomarily defer to the statements of the official policymaker,\nnot others, even though the others may occupy important agency\npositions.\"); Henry, 74 F.3d at 5-6 (recognizing that in large,\nbureaucratic agencies, \"different officials may not act identically\nin every case,\" but, nevertheless, \"[a] certain amount of asymmetry\nis lawful\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n                                      -21-\n\f              That   ends    this   aspect    of   the    matter.     Because     the\n\nHospital has failed to show that the Secretary's interpretation of\n\nthe new provider exemption constitutes a reversal of position, its\n\nargument fails.        Although patently inconsistent applications of\n\nagency standards to similar situations are by definition arbitrary,\n\nthe law does not demand perfect consistency in administrative\n\ndecisionmaking.       See Ill. Bell Tel. Co. v. FCC, 740 F.2d 465, 470-\n\n71 (7th Cir. 1984).\n\n              Along somewhat the same lines, the Hospital urges what\n\namounts to an ex post facto theory.                   It asseverates that HHS\n\npublished its new guideline, PRM-1 § 2533.1, in August of 1997,\n\nmore   than    two   years     after   the    Hospital     first    submitted     its\n\napplication for new provider status.               Thus, the Hospital asserts,\n\nthe Secretary should not be able to change the rules by applying\n\nthe new   guideline         retroactively.         This   is   especially   so,    it\n\nmaintains, because the prior guideline, PRM-1 § 2604.1, stated that\n\n\"changes of the institution's ownership or geographic location do\n\nnot in itself [sic] alter the type of health care furnished and\n\nshall not be considered in the determination of the length of\n\noperation.\"\n\n              This argument is unavailing.            The Manual is merely an\n\ninterpretive guide, and interpretive guides generally do not have\n\nthe force of law.      See, e.g., Arnold v. United Parcel Serv., Inc.,\n\n136 F.3d 854, 864 (1st Cir. 1998) (collecting cases).                       In any\n\n\n                                       -22-\n\fevent, the Board's decision in S. Shore I did not rely upon (and,\n\nindeed, never cited) PRM-1 § 2533.1.            Last — but far from least —\n\neven though the Manual did not specifically incorporate change of\n\nownership into the definition of new provider until 1997, there is\n\nample evidence that HCFA did apply the more limited concept of\n\nchange   of    ownership   involving      DON    rights     to   new     provider\n\ndeterminations prior to 1995 (the time when the Hospital initially\n\nrequested the exemption). See Appellee's Br. at 43 (conceding that\n\nHCFA previously had denied new provider exemptions on the basis of\n\ntransferred    DON   rights);    see    also     Larkin     Chase      Nursing    &\n\nRestorative Ctr. v. Shalala, No. 99-00214, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS\n\n23655 (D.D.C. Feb. 6, 2001).       Consequently, we see no basis for\n\ncharacterizing the 1997 implementation of PRM-1 § 2533.1 as a post\n\nhoc rationalization.\n\n                            C.   Equivalency.\n\n          Previous     ownership       aside,      an     applicant      is      not\n\ndisqualified from access to the new provider exemption unless it\n\n\"has operated as the [same] type of provider (or the equivalent)\"\n\nfor the prescribed period.       42 C.F.R. § 413.30(e)(2).             In a last-\n\nditch effort to ward off disqualification, the Hospital asks us to\n\nrule that the Board erred in finding that Prospect Hill had\n\noperated as the equivalent of an SNF (and, thus, as an equivalent\n\nof the TCC).    The district court did not reach this issue, and the\n\n\n\n\n                                   -23-\n\fSecretary requests us to remand it to the lower court for specific\n\nfindings.     The Hospital, however, urges us to decide it.\n\n             Although we sometimes decline to pass upon issues not\n\nfirst vetted by the district court, e.g., N.E. Reg'l Council of\n\nCarpenters v. Kinton, 284 F.3d 9, 19 (1st Cir. 2002), that is by no\n\nmeans an inflexible rule.      Where, as here, we are called upon to\n\nview a static administrative record through the same prism as the\n\nlower court, deciding the case fully is often the option of choice.\n\nSee, e.g., Trustees of Mich. Laborers' Health Care Fund v. Gibbons,\n\n209 F.3d 587, 595 & n.5 (6th Cir. 2000) (collecting cases).              This\n\nis a paradigmatic case for the application of such a principle:\n\nthe facts are straightforward and fully developed, and the parties\n\nhave had notice of, and ample opportunity to respond to, the merits\n\nof   the    unaddressed   issue.     We    turn,   then,    to   the   Board's\n\nequivalency finding.\n\n             The Hospital's argument on this point amounts to an\n\nattack upon the sufficiency of the evidence.               This is an uphill\n\nclimb, for courts ordinarily do not afford plenary review to\n\nadministrative factfinding.        So it is here:    our review is limited\n\nto whether the equivalency finding is supported by substantial\n\nevidence in the administrative record.         See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(E);\n\nsee also 42 U.S.C. § 1395oo(f)(1) (conforming judicial review in\n\nMedicare matters to the standards set forth in section 706 of the\n\nAPA).      So long as the Board reasonably could have credited those\n\n\n                                    -24-\n\fwitnesses and reports supporting its finding that Prospect Hill had\n\noperated    as   the   equivalent    of   an   SNF,    we    must   sustain    its\n\nequivalency finding.      See Mass. DPW, 984 F.2d at 525-26; Concerned\n\nCitizens on I-190 v. Sec'y of Transp., 641 F.2d 1, 7 (1st Cir.\n\n1981).     It is immaterial how we, if sitting as a court of first\n\ninstance, would have resolved the disputed questions of fact.\n\n            Generally speaking, substantial evidence comprises proof\n\nthat a reasonable mind might find adequate, in light of the record\n\nas a whole, to support a particular conclusion.                NLRB v. Beverly\n\nEnters.-Mass., Inc., 174 F.3d 13, 21-22 (1st Cir. 1999).                      Such\n\nproof suffices even if the evidence also might support some other,\n\ninconsistent conclusion.      Posadas de P.R. Assocs., Inc. v. NLRB,\n\n243 F.3d 87, 90 (1st Cir. 2001). So viewed, \"substantial evidence\"\n\nis an objective standard that gives the agency the benefit of the\n\ndoubt as to disputed facts. See Beverly Enters.-Mass., 174 F.3d at\n\n21-22.   This sets the bar fairly low.\n\n            In its original denial of the Hospital's application for\n\nan exemption, HCFA found that Prospect Hill had satisfied the\n\ndefinition of an SNF because it had furnished skilled nursing care\n\nand related services for qualified persons as set forth in 42\n\nC.F.R. § 409.33(b) and (c).         HCFA based this finding in part on\n\nservices    that   Prospect   Hill    provided        only   sporadically      (as\n\ndocumented in that facility's periodic activity reports) as well as\n\non the testimony of various witnesses presented at the Board's\n\n\n                                     -25-\n\fhearing.    The Hospital argues that the record contains conflicting\n\nevidence    and    that    the   witnesses   favorable    to   the    Hospital\n\noutnumbered those favorable to the Secretary.            These observations\n\nare true as far as they go — but neither goes very far.                 Within\n\nwide limits, the weight and credibility of the evidence are for the\n\nBoard to determine.        See Am. Textile Mfrs. Inst. v. Donovan, 452\n\nU.S. 490, 523 (1981); Posadas, 243 F.3d at 90.           Here, the Board's\n\nfinding is supported by substantial evidence in the record.                No\n\nmore is exigible.\n\n            Taking a slightly different tack, the Hospital seizes on\n\nan   undisputed    fact:     that    Prospect   Hill   typically     furnished\n\ncustodial services, performing more sophisticated services only\n\nrarely.     Extrapolating from this fact, it contends that Prospect\n\nHill could not have operated as the equivalent of an SNF (which\n\noffers sophisticated nursing care as a staple). This strikes us as\n\nan oversimplification.\n\n            To be sure, Prospect Hill, in its heyday, was a Medicaid-\n\ncertified Level III nursing home that provided custodial care\n\nprimarily to psychiatric patients — but it also periodically\n\ndelivered skilled nursing, restorative care, and other therapeutic\n\nservices.    The TCC has a different orientation:         it is a Level II\n\nnursing     home    providing       mostly   rehabilitative     care     (and,\n\n\n\n\n                                      -26-\n\foccasionally, custodial care) to a wide variety of patients.7\n\nBased on these and other differences, the Hospital suggests three\n\nways in which the Board may have embarrassed the substantial\n\nevidence standard.      First, the Hospital asserts that because the\n\nnew provider exemption makes no explicit allowance for facilities\n\nas   disparate   as   Prospect   Hill   and   the   TCC,   such   facilities\n\nnecessarily must lie outside the ambit of the equivalency rubric.\n\nSecond, the Hospital contends that in order to be an equivalent of\n\nan SNF, a facility would have to meet the definition of an SNF —\n\nand Prospect Hill did not.       Third, the Hospital posits that, given\n\nthe underlying policy of the new provider exemption, Prospect\n\nHill's sporadic deployment of skilled nursing services simply does\n\nnot justify a finding of equivalency.\n\n           All three of these arguments miss the essential point.\n\nThe Secretary, in his discretion, reasonably could have looked not\n\n\n      7\n      These levels are part of a taxonomy developed by the\nCommonwealth with respect to its administration of the Medicaid\nprogram. The Commonwealth defines a Level III nursing home as a\nsupportive nursing care facility \"that provide[s] routine nursing\nservices and periodic availability of skilled nursing, restorative\nand other therapeutic services, as indicated, in addition to the\nminimum, basic care and services required for patients whose\ncondition is stabilized to the point that they need only supportive\nnursing care, supervision and observation.\" S. Shore II, 204 F.\nSupp. 2d at 78 n.12 (quoting Mass. Regs. Code tit. 105, § 151.020).\nIt defines a Level II nursing home as a skilled nursing care\nfacility \"that provide[s] continuous skilled care and meaningful\navailability of restorative services and other therapeutic services\nin addition to the minimum, basic care and services required for\npatients who show potential for improvement or restoration to a\nstabilized condition or who have a deteriorating condition\nrequiring skilled care.\" Id.\n\n                                    -27-\n\fat the particular level of care provided by a nursing facility,\n\nbut, rather, at a broader definition of equivalency.          Although our\n\nreview is geared to whether the Secretary's decision rests on\n\nsubstantial evidence, we must in the process defer to what the\n\nSecretary reasonably found to be relevant.          To do otherwise would\n\nfetter the Secretary's discretion in an unwarranted manner.                See\n\nVilla View Cmty. Hosp., Inc. v. Heckler, 728 F.2d 539, 543 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1984); see also Mass. DPW, 984 F.2d at 527 (reiterating that\n\nthe court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the agency).\n\n             The Board accepted this premise — and reasonably so.          In\n\nthe process, it cited specifically to the nursing home reform\n\nprovisions    of    the   Omnibus   Budget   Reconciliation   Act   of    1987\n\ngoverning the certification of long-term care facilities under\n\nMedicare and Medicaid.        See Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of\n\n1987 (Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1987), Pub. L. No. 100-203, §§\n\n4211(a)(3) & (c), 4212(a) & (b), 4213(a), 4216, 101 Stat. 1330-182,\n\n-196, -204, -207, -212, -213, -220 (1987) (codified as amended at\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1395r).       These provisions indicate that both Medicare\n\nSNFs and Medicaid nursing facilities provide the same basic range\n\nof services.       See S. Shore I, supra, at *14, *17 (explaining that\n\nthese provisions require both Medicare SNFs and Medicaid nursing\n\nfacilities to provide the range of services described in sections\n\n1819(b)(4) and 1919(b)(4) of the Social Security Act).                   Thus,\n\nProspect Hill, as a Medicaid facility, \"would have already incurred\n\n\n                                     -28-\n\fthe start-up costs associated with the development of the capacity\n\nto furnish inpatient SNF services, by meeting the requirements for\n\nparticipation.\"        Id. at *2.\n\n              This is a convincing argument. Faced with it, we decline\n\nto substitute our judgment for the Secretary's as to whether so\n\nbroad-gauged a comparison contradicts the underlying purpose of\n\neither the challenged regulation or the enabling statute.                    In the\n\nlast    analysis,     Medicare      is     a     complex   and   highly   technical\n\nregulatory scheme, and courts should be hesitant to second-guess\n\nthe Secretary in such matters.                 See Thomas Jefferson, 512 U.S. at\n\n512; Cheshire Hosp. v. N.H.-Vt. Hosp'n Serv., Inc., 689 F.2d 1112,\n\n1117 (1st Cir. 1982); see also Villa View, 728 F.2d at 543\n\n(explaining that a court cannot reverse the Secretary's decision in\n\nsuch a case when doing so would require displacement of the\n\nSecretary's policy).          We therefore uphold the Board's finding of\n\nequivalency.\n\nV.    CONCLUSION\n\n              We need go no further.              Generic perceptions of reality\n\nare not the gold standard when administrative discretion is in\n\nplay.    Where Congress has chosen to cede substantial discretion to\n\nan agency, a reviewing court should scrutinize the administrative\n\nrecord    with      due    regard    for       that   discretion   and    weigh   the\n\nreasonableness of the Secretary's action accordingly.                     Mass. DPW,\n\n984    F.2d    at   522.      That    respectful        approach    is    especially\n\n\n                                           -29-\n\fappropriate when the challenged action — here, the interpretation\n\nof the new provider exemption — plainly calls for a delicate\n\nbalancing   of   a   melange    of   factors   within   the   scope   of   the\n\nSecretary's expertise.         Hewing to these precepts, we affirm the\n\nBoard's denial of the Hospital's application for a new provider\n\nexemption, reverse the district court's contrary decision, and\n\ndirect the entry of judgment in favor of the Secretary.\n\n\n\nReversed and remanded for the entry of judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -30-\n\f",

This appeal leads us into the\n\noften surreal world of Medicare administration.      It arises out of\n\nefforts by South Shore Hospital (the Hospital), an acute care\n\nhospital located in South Weymouth, Massachusetts, to obtain relief\n\nfor its transitional care center (the TCC) from Medicare's cost\n\nlimits on reimbursement of routine patient care expenses.         The\n\nHealth Care Financing Administration (HCFA) denied the Hospital's\n\napplication on the ground that its purchase of determination of\n\nneed (DON) rights from an unaffiliated nursing home rendered\n\nunavailable the so-called \"new provider\" exemption codified at 42\n\nC.F.R. § 413.30(e)(2) (1994).1    The Provider Reimbursement Review\n\nBoard (the Board) of the United States Department of Health and\n\nHuman Services (HHS) affirmed this determination.        See S. Shore\n\nHosp., No. 99-D38, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">297452</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (PRRB Apr. 21, 1999) (S. Shore\n\nI).   The federal district court, however, took a different view,\n\nreversing the Board's decision. S. Shore Hosp. v. Thompson, 204 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 76, 83 (D. Mass. 2002)   (S. Shore II).    This timely appeal\n\nensued.\n\n          We conclude that the new provider exemption is less than\n\npellucid; that the Secretary's interpretation of the relevant\n\n\n      1\n      Although the new provider exemption lately has migrated,\nafter certain amendments not relevant here, to 42 C.F.R. §\n413.30(d) (2000), the previous version of the rule was in effect at\nall times material hereto, and we will continue to refer to that\nversion.   By like token, even though HCFA is now known as the\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services, we will continue to use\nthe original acronym.\n\n                                  -2-\n\fregulatory language is reasonable (although not inevitable); that\n\nthe Hospital has failed to show that the Secretary vacillated in\n\nhis interpretation; and that substantial evidence supports the\n\nBoard's finding that the now-defunct nursing home from which the\n\nHospital    acquired     the    necessary     DON    rights    operated    as    an\n\nequivalent of the TCC.         Consequently, we sustain the Secretary's\n\nrefusal to classify the TCC as a new provider, reverse the decision\n\nof the district court, and direct the entry of judgment in favor of\n\nthe Secretary.\n\nI.   STATUTORY AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK\n\n             The Medicare Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1395-1395ggg, provides\n\nfederal funding for a range of medical services for the elderly and\n\ndisabled,    including      reimbursement     for    the   reasonable     cost    of\n\ncertain services provided by skilled nursing facilities (SNFs).\n\nId. § 1395f(b)(1); 42 C.F.R. § 413.1(a)(2)(ii), (b), (g).                 The Act\n\nexpressly vests in the Secretary of HHS the discretion to determine\n\nreasonable costs by regulations that, inter alia, \"may provide for\n\nthe establishment of limits on the [costs] to be recognized as\n\nreasonable    based    on   estimates    of   the    costs    necessary    in    the\n\nefficient    delivery    of    needed   health      services.\"     42   U.S.C.     §\n\n1395x(v)(1)(A).       In this regard, the Act mandates routine cost\n\nlimits (RCLs) that restrict per diem reimbursement to 112% of the\n\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fnational    average   for   similarly    situated     providers.2   Id.   §\n\n1395yy(a).    Exemptions and exceptions that permit higher rates of\n\nreimbursement are allowed \"to the extent the Secretary deems\n\nappropriate, based upon case mix or circumstances beyond the\n\ncontrol of the facility.\"      Id. § 1395yy(c).\n\n            At issue here is an exemption for \"new providers\" of\n\nskilled nursing services. 42 C.F.R. § 413.30(e)(2). The Secretary\n\npromulgated this exemptive regulation in 1979 to ameliorate the\n\n\"initial underutilization\" faced by many market entrants.           44 Fed.\n\nReg. 31,802.     It authorizes an exemption when \"[t]he provider of\n\ninpatient services has operated as the type of provider (or the\n\nequivalent) for which it is certified for Medicare, under present\n\nand previous ownership, for less than three full years.\" 42 C.F.R.\n\n§ 413.30(e)(2).       This, then, permits the Secretary, under some\n\ncircumstances, to deny the exemption by tying together present and\n\nprevious ownership.\n\n             Although this phraseology makes previous ownership an\n\nimportant datum, the regulation does not dictate how previous\n\nownership    determinations   should     be   made.    The   Secretary   has\n\ninterpreted this phrase, more majorum, by reference to Part I of\n\nHCFA's Provider Reimbursement Manual (the Manual).            Pertinently,\n\n\n     2\n      Routine service costs include those costs, such as room and\nboard, basic medical supplies, ordinary dietary and nursing\nservices, and other quotidian expenses, for which an institution\ntypically would assess a single per diem service charge. 42 C.F.R.\n§ 413.53(b).\n\n                                   -4-\n\fthe Manual has long defined \"change of ownership\" as including the\n\nsale of \"all or some portion of a provider's facility or assets\n\n(used to render patient care),\" so long as such sale \"affects\n\nlicensure or certification of the provider entity.\" PRM-1 § 1500.7\n\n(1976).     The Manual eventually integrated change of ownership, so\n\ndefined, into determinations of previous ownership and, ultimately,\n\ninto the definition of new provider.               See id. § 2533.1.E.1.b\n\n(1997). It warns, however, that \"[t]he mere existence of a [change\n\nof    ownership]    does    not    in   itself   make   an   institution   or\n\ninstitutional complex eligible for a new provider exemption.\"              Id.\n\n§ 2533.1.E.     Rather, the Secretary conducts a comparison of the\n\noperations conducted by the previous and current owners in order to\n\ndecide whether the current owner qualifies.             Equivalency plays an\n\nimportant    role   in     this   comparison,    for,   generally   speaking,\n\nprevious ownership will not be carried forward unless, at a bare\n\nminimum, the previous owner's operations and the current owner's\n\noperations are deemed equivalent.\n\nII.   PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n            The Hospital began to plan for the TCC in 1992, with an\n\neye toward supplementing its existing continuum of care. But there\n\nwas a rub: Massachusetts, like many states, titrates the provision\n\nof health care by requiring various types of facilities to secure\n\ndeterminations of need as a prerequisite to offering covered\n\n\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fservices.3      See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111, § 25C; Mass. Regs. Code\n\ntit. 105, § 100.352. Because Massachusetts had placed a moratorium\n\non the issuance of DON rights for skilled nursing beds, the\n\nHospital's plans were stymied until it arranged to purchase the\n\nnecessary    DON     rights    from   Prospect   Hill   Manor    Nursing     Home\n\n(Prospect Hill), a facility that had gone into receivership in\n\nMarch 1993.      No other transfers of property, patient records, or\n\nassets accompanied the purchase, and the entity known as Prospect\n\nHill vanished shortly after transferring the DON rights.\n\n             The Commonwealth of Massachusetts approved the transfer\n\nof DON rights on condition that the Hospital assume liability for\n\nany and all Medicaid overpayments to Prospect Hill.              Subsequently,\n\nit   approved    a   phantom    \"relocation\"     of   Prospect   Hill   to     the\n\nHospital's campus.      Armed with these approvals, the TCC opened its\n\ndoors in January of 1995.\n\n             On May 17, 1995, the Hospital petitioned HCFA to classify\n\nits nascent TCC as a new provider.               The Hospital's continuing\n\ninterest in the exemption is easily grasped:             in 1995 — its first\n\nfull year of operation — the TCC's routine service costs exceeded\n\nthe applicable RCLs by almost $900,000. And when Congress replaced\n\nMedicare's      existing      cost-based     reimbursement   system     with     a\n\n\n\n      3\n      What Massachusetts calls determination of need rights are\nknown elsewhere as certificate of need (CON) rights. See, e.g.,\nR.I. Gen. Laws § 23-15-1 to -10 (2001).    We use the two terms\ninterchangeably.\n\n                                       -6-\n\fprospective     payment     system     that     looked   to    a    facility's      1995\n\nreimbursement levels as a basis for setting future rates, see\n\nBalanced Budget Act of 1997, Pub. L. No. 105-33, § 4432(a), 111\n\nStat.   251,       422     (codified      as     amended       at    42     U.S.C.     §\n\n1395yy(e)(3)(A)(ii)), the lure of the new provider exemption became\n\nirresistible.\n\n            In due course, HCFA rejected the Hospital's application\n\non the ground that the conveyance of DON rights required that\n\nProspect    Hill's       previous    operations     be     imputed     to    the    TCC.\n\nFollowing     an    evidentiary        hearing,    the     Board     affirmed       this\n\ndetermination.       S. Shore I, supra, at *18.                In so holding, the\n\nBoard   found      that,    in   the    circumstances         of    this    case,    the\n\ntransferred DON rights were a sufficient basis for imputation of\n\nprevious ownership to the purchaser and that Prospect Hill and the\n\nTCC were equivalent providers.                 Id. at *16-*17.         In regard to\n\nequivalency the Board acknowledged that Prospect Hill had not\n\nfurnished the same level of nursing care that characterized the\n\noperations of the TCC, but nonetheless concluded that Prospect Hill\n\nhad been operating as an SNF during the three years prior to the\n\nconveyance. Id. at *17. The Secretary declined to intervene, thus\n\nmaking the Board's decision administratively final.                        42 U.S.C. §\n\n1395oo(f)(1).\n\n            The Hospital petitioned for judicial review.                      See id.\n\nThe district court reversed, declaring that the TCC was a new\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fprovider in every relevant sense and that the Board could not\n\nreasonably have ruled otherwise.            S. Shore II, 204 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n82.    Accordingly, the court remanded the matter to the Board for a\n\ndetermination of what level of reimbursement the TCC, as a new\n\nprovider, should receive.         Id. at 83.    This appeal followed.\n\nIII.

ANALYSIS\n\n           We    turn     now   to    the    Secretary's   construction      and\n\napplication      of     the   new    provider    exemption,   42    C.F.R.    §\n\n413.30(e)(2).         Our analysis proceeds in three steps.         First, we\n\ndiscuss the reasonableness of the Secretary's interpretation of the\n\nexemption.      Second, we address the Hospital's related claim that\n\nthe Secretary has applied the regulation willy-nilly.              Finally, we\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fscrutinize the Board's finding that Prospect Hill and the TCC were\n\nequivalent providers.\n\n               A.   Interpretation of the Exemption.\n\n           Despite the fact that Medicare rules fall squarely within\n\nthe   Secretary's   domain,    deference    is   due    to   the   Secretary's\n\ninterpretation of a particular regulation only when the language of\n\nthe regulation either (1) compels that interpretation or (2) admits\n\nof differing interpretations, and the Secretary chooses reasonably\n\namong them.

Here, the Hospital's main argument is\n\nthat the new provider exemption is unambiguous and demands an\n\ninterpretation at odds with the Secretary's rendition.\n\n           We find the new provider provision vague (and, therefore,\n\nmanifestly ambiguous).        This case hinges on the meaning of the\n\nphrase \"previous    ownership,\"    and     section     413.30(e)(2)   neither\n\ndefines nor explains that phrase. To complicate matters, the terms\n\n\"provider\" and \"institution\" are central to an understanding of the\n\nexemption, and those terms subsume any number of components,\n\nchanges in one or all of which might, depending on the context,\n\nlead one to deduce that a new provider has (or has not) been\n\ncreated.   Because the regulation is not drawn in blacks and whites\n\nbut leaves significant gray areas unresolved, it is ambiguous. See\n\nParagon Health Network, Inc. v. Thompson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773476\"><a href=\"/opinion/773476/paragon-health-network-inc-dba-milwaukee-subacute-center-aka/\"><span class=\"volume\">251</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1141</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1148 (7th\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fCir. 2001) (discussing the same regulation and reaching the same\n\nconclusion).\n\n            To state the obvious, the fact that the regulation is\n\nambiguous means that some interpretation is inevitable.                   The\n\nquestion reduces, therefore, to whether using the transfer of DON\n\nrights as a basis for ascribing Prospect Hill's operations to the\n\nHospital    comes    within    a     reasonable   interpretation     of   the\n\nregulation.      We think that this question must be answered in the\n\naffirmative.\n\n            In this case, the Secretary relied on section 1500.7 of\n\nthe Manual for guidance.        Noting that Prospect Hill's DON rights\n\nwere virtually the only assets it owned              at the time of the\n\ntransfer, he determined that the sale of the rights qualified as a\n\npurchase of assets affecting licensure or certification (and,\n\ntherefore, constituted a change of ownership).          S. Shore I, supra,\n\nat *13.    In this connection, the Secretary explained that there\n\nneed not    be   a   high   degree   of   operational   continuity   between\n\nproviders in order for the operation of one to be imputed to the\n\nother.    Following this train of thought and citing section 2604.1\n\nof the Manual, the Secretary determined that the relocation of beds\n\nfrom Prospect Hill to the TCC did not substantially change the\n\npopulation served or the number of inpatient days accumulated. Id.\n\nat *15.    Concomitantly, the Secretary \"looked back\" at Prospect\n\nHill's operational history and determined that it had functioned as\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fthe equivalent of an SNF during the previous three years because it\n\nhad furnished some skilled nursing rehabilitation services, as\n\nidentified in 42 C.F.R. § 409.33(b) and (c).            S. Shore I, supra, at\n\n*14.       Accordingly, he denied the Hospital's application for a new\n\nprovider exemption.\n\n               The Hospital, ably represented, attempts to discredit the\n\nSecretary's      reasoning      in   several    different   ways.   First,   it\n\nemphasizes the genesis of the change of ownership definition\n\ncontained      in   PRM-1   §   1500.7    (which   originally   addressed    the\n\nobligations of facilities leaving the Medicare program) and argues\n\nthat the Secretary arbitrarily applied this definition to the new\n\nprovider exemption.         But the Secretary, through HCFA, historically\n\nhas defined change of ownership differently in different contexts,4\n\nand we see no reason why the Secretary, in the exercise of his\n\nbroad authority to interpret regulations that he himself has\n\npromulgated, cannot choose to apply section 1500.7's dilucidation\n\nin this context, regardless of the provision's origins.\n\n               The Hospital also argues that a transfer of DON rights\n\nalone cannot constitute a continuation of ownership for purposes of\n\nthis case because Prospect Hill closed its doors for unrelated\n\n\n       4\n      To cite one example, HCFA has regarded a transfer of\ncorporate stock as a change of ownership for some purposes but not\nfor others. See Las Encinas Hosp., No. 95-0303, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">611452</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(PRRB Sept. 11, 1998). To cite another, HCFA defines changes of\nownership for Medicare certification purposes differently than for\nMedicare payment purposes. See N. Fla. Physical Therapy Serv., No.\n98-D10, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">119693</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (HCFA Feb. 3, 1998).\n\n                                         -12-\n\freasons (and, thus, the transfer did not contribute to the loss of\n\nits licensure and certification).                 The district court found merit\n\nin this argument, see S. Shore II, 204 F. Supp. 2d at 81-82, but we\n\ndo not.     Fairly read, section 1500.7 requires only that the\n\ntransfer \"affect\" licensure or certification, not that it be the\n\ndispositive factor.       Here, the DON rights were a sine qua non for\n\nthe operation of a nursing home (whether Prospect Hill or the TCC)\n\n— and the handsome price that the Hospital paid for them (which\n\nappears to have been in the range of $125,000 - $150,000) attests\n\nto their materiality.              We cannot say that the Secretary acted\n\nunreasonably in rejecting the conceit that the significance of DON\n\nrights should be measured solely by the happenstance of when the\n\noriginal owner of the rights went out of business.\n\n           In a related vein, we question the emphasis placed by the\n\nlower court on the fact that Prospect Hill's DON rights were out of\n\ncirculation at the time of the purchase.                      See id. at 82.       The\n\ncourt's    implication        is    that     Medicare     ought   to    spend     more\n\nreimbursement       dollars    for    routine       service    costs    because    the\n\nHospital has \"rescued\" these dormant beds from the scrap heap. Id.\n\nEven if we credit the district court's characterization of the\n\nHospital   as   a    rescuer,       however,       that   would   not   impugn     the\n\nSecretary's discretionary decision to treat all purchasers of DON\n\nrights alike. See Arkansas v. Oklahoma, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112698\"><a href=\"/opinion/112698/arkansas-v-oklahoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">91</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 113-14 (1992)\n\n(affirming that, within wide limits, agencies may decide for\n\n\n                                           -13-\n\fthemselves what factors pertain to their decisionmaking).                       The\n\nSecretary's vision of the transfer as simply relocating the beds in\n\nquestion is not impermissible.\n\n            This     reasoning      also        defeats       the      Hospital's\n\n\"fragmentation\" argument, in which it points out that a previous\n\nowner may sell its DON rights to one party, its site to a second\n\nparty, and a third pivotal asset (say, its equipment) to yet\n\nanother party. According to the Hospital, this threatens to create\n\na situation where one previous owner can spawn a multitude of\n\nsuccessors, none of whom will be regarded as a new provider.\n\n            Unlike   the   Hospital,       we    find    this    result    to    be\n\nacceptable.    After all, we would not hesitate to use the term\n\n\"previous   ownership\"     in   reference       to   three   100-bed    hospitals\n\nresulting from the split of a single 300-bed facility.

Consequently, the fragmentation argument\n\nfails.\n\n            The Hospital next asserts that its actions were guided by\n\nthe plain meaning of the regulation and that \"[a]ny contrary\n\ninterpretation of the regulation would require a gross distortion\n\nof the English language.\"        Appellee's Br. at 38.          This approach is\n\ndoubly flawed.       In the first place, it overlooks the patent\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fambiguity of the regulation.          In the second place, accepting it\n\nwould make a mockery of the deference due to the Secretary's\n\ninterpretation of his own regulations.             As the Hospital itself\n\nacknowledges, change of ownership is a term of art in the Medicare\n\ncontext.     As such, interpretation of the term lies peculiarly\n\nwithin the compass of the Secretary's expertise.                     See Thomas\n\nJefferson, 512 U.S. at 512; Pauley v. BethEnergy Mines, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112639\"><a href=\"/opinion/112639/pauley-v-bethenergy-mines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">680</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 697 (1991).\n\n            In a variation on this theme, the Hospital maintains that\n\nthe   Secretary's   interpretation      of   the   new    provider    exemption\n\noppugns the underlying policy of the exemption when applied to\n\nstates, such as Massachusetts, that have imposed moratoria on new\n\nnursing home beds.      As the Seventh Circuit explained, however,\n\nmoratoria on DON rights effectively limit the number of permitted\n\nbeds and thus reduce competition among such facilities.                Paragon,\n\n251 F.3d at 1150.       This means that any given facility in a\n\nmoratorium state will be less likely to experience and sustain a\n\nhigh vacancy rate during its early years.                Consequently, new or\n\nexpanded facilities in moratorium states have less need for special\n\nswaddling     to    prevent     the     financial        drain   of     initial\n\nunderutilization.     See id.\n\n            The district court attempted to distinguish Paragon as a\n\nchange of ownership between related corporations. S. Shore II, 204\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 81.        But the court never explained how this\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\fcircumstance compromised the underlying policy of the new provider\n\nexemption.     Insofar as we can discern, relationship through a\n\ncommon corporate parent will have little effect on whether the\n\ntransfer of DON rights does (or does not) ameliorate a facility's\n\ninitial underutilization.      Once that is understood, there is no\n\nprincipled reason why the facility discussed in Paragon should have\n\nany diminished claim to improved reimbursement by virtue of being\n\na related subsidiary.5\n\n             In a further endeavor to blunt the force of Paragon, the\n\nHospital notes that the language of the regulation at issue does\n\nnot distinguish between facilities in states with and without\n\nmoratoria.       For   this   reason,   it   muses,   the   Secretary's\n\ninterpretation inevitably will lead to non-uniformity.       Relatedly,\n\n\n\n     5\n      The Hospital has called to our attention through successive\npost-argument letters, see Fed. R. App. P. 28(j); 1st Cir. R.\n28(j), the recent decisions in Mercy Med.

We need find only that, from some\n\nplausible standpoint, the Secretary had an organizing primum mobile\n\nsufficient to justify his actions.             The Secretary's proffered\n\noligopoly effect theory passes this test.\n\n            The   Hospital's     rejoinder     is    that   the   Secretary's\n\ninterpretation of section 1500.7 effectively obviates new provider\n\nstatus for many (or even all) \"new\" SNFs within Massachusetts.\n\nEven if true, this lament does not call the Secretary's judgment\n\ninto serious question.       The goal of regulation is not to provide\n\nexact uniformity of treatment, but, rather, to provide uniformity\n\nof rules so that those similarly situated will be treated alike.\n\nIn addition, as the Seventh Circuit suggested, the Secretary\n\nreasonably may have concluded that, in states that have imposed\n\nmoratoria because they no longer need additional nursing beds,\n\nsubsidizing the start-up costs of new SNFs is unnecessary for the\n\nefficient delivery of health-care services.            Paragon, 251 F.3d at\n\n1149.\n\n            To sum up, we find no plausible reason to discredit the\n\nSecretary's rationale that, when one facility purchases another's\n\nDON rights in a moratorium state, lessened competition will enhance\n\ninitial utilization (and, thus, will help defray costs in the\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\ftransferee facility's early years).      On that rationale, it makes\n\nsense, for purposes of construing the new provider exemption, to\n\nattribute the operations of the seller to the acquirer of the DON\n\nrights.    After all, \"[w]hen Congress entrusts an agency with the\n\nresponsibility for drawing lines, and the agency exercises that\n\nauthority in a reasonable way, neither the fact that there are\n\nother possible places at which the line could be drawn nor the fact\n\nthat the administrative scheme might occasionally operate unfairly\n\nfrom a particular participant's perspective is sufficient, standing\n\nalone, to undermine the scheme's legality.\" Mass. DPW, 984 F.2d at\n\n522.      We therefore follow Paragon and uphold the Secretary's\n\ninterpretation of the disputed regulation as against the Hospital's\n\n\"reasonableness\" challenge.\n\n                          B.    Consistency.\n\n            The Hospital has a fallback position:       even if the\n\nSecretary's interpretation of the new provider exemption is not\n\narbitrary and capricious, its thesis runs, his interpretation\n\nflouts prior practice.    The theoretical foundation on which this\n\nposition rests is sound:       if, over time, an agency interprets a\n\nregulation erratically, that inconsistency may warrant a court in\n\ndeclining to defer to the agency in a particular situation.

To support this plaint,\n\nthe Hospital cites a single incident, involving a facility known as\n\nMeridian-Spa Creek, in which HCFA granted a new provider exemption\n\ndespite   the     facility's   use   of   transferred    CON   rights.      This\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\fcitation is unpersuasive.        The incident occurred well before the\n\nTCC applied for its exemption, and it is impossible to tell from\n\nthe scanty record why HCFA granted Meridian-Spa Creek an exemption.\n\n          It is incumbent on a party complaining of inconsistency\n\nin administrative action \"to bring before the reviewing court\n\nsufficient particulars of how the appellant was situated, how the\n\nallegedly favored party was situated, and how such similarities as\n\nmay exist dictate similar treatment and how such dissimilarities as\n\nmay exist are irrelevant or outweighed.\"           P.I.A.

While the\n\nHospital speculates that the unexplained grant of an exemption to\n\nMeridian-Spa   Creek   betrays    a    pervasive   inconsistency   in   HCFA\n\ndecisions, it has not supported this conjecture with proof.             Nor\n\nhas the Hospital shown that its circumstances bear a substantial\n\nsimilarity to those of Meridian-Spa Creek in all (or nearly all)\n\nrelevant aspects. Hence, we cannot say that the Meridian-Spa Creek\n\nscenario demonstrates administrative inconsistency.6\n\n\n     6\n      In all events, the Meridian-Spa Creek determination may be no\nmore than a waif in the wilderness. It was not appealed to the\nBoard, much less to the HCFA Administrator or the Secretary. Thus,\nthe determination may well be explained as the decision of a lower-\nlevel agency employee that cannot bind either the Board or the\nSecretary. See Irving v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"759695\"><a href=\"/opinion/759695/gail-merchant-irving-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 166 (1st\nCir. 1998) (en banc) (\"To determine what is agency policy, courts\ncustomarily defer to the statements of the official policymaker,\nnot others, even though the others may occupy important agency\npositions.\"); Henry, 74 F.3d at 5-6 (recognizing that in large,\nbureaucratic agencies, \"different officials may not act identically\nin every case,\" but, nevertheless, \"[a] certain amount of asymmetry\nis lawful\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n                                      -21-\n\f              That   ends    this   aspect    of   the    matter.     Because     the\n\nHospital has failed to show that the Secretary's interpretation of\n\nthe new provider exemption constitutes a reversal of position, its\n\nargument fails.        Although patently inconsistent applications of\n\nagency standards to similar situations are by definition arbitrary,\n\nthe law does not demand perfect consistency in administrative\n\ndecisionmaking.

It asseverates that HHS\n\npublished its new guideline, PRM-1 § 2533.1, in August of 1997,\n\nmore   than    two   years     after   the    Hospital     first    submitted     its\n\napplication for new provider status.               Thus, the Hospital asserts,\n\nthe Secretary should not be able to change the rules by applying\n\nthe new   guideline         retroactively.         This   is   especially   so,    it\n\nmaintains, because the prior guideline, PRM-1 § 2604.1, stated that\n\n\"changes of the institution's ownership or geographic location do\n\nnot in itself [sic] alter the type of health care furnished and\n\nshall not be considered in the determination of the length of\n\noperation.\"\n\n              This argument is unavailing.

The district court did not reach this issue, and the\n\n\n\n\n                                   -23-\n\fSecretary requests us to remand it to the lower court for specific\n\nfindings.

This sets the bar fairly low.\n\n            In its original denial of the Hospital's application for\n\nan exemption, HCFA found that Prospect Hill had satisfied the\n\ndefinition of an SNF because it had furnished skilled nursing care\n\nand related services for qualified persons as set forth in 42\n\nC.F.R. § 409.33(b) and (c).         HCFA based this finding in part on\n\nservices    that   Prospect   Hill    provided        only   sporadically      (as\n\ndocumented in that facility's periodic activity reports) as well as\n\non the testimony of various witnesses presented at the Board's\n\n\n                                     -25-\n\fhearing.

These observations\n\nare true as far as they go — but neither goes very far.

Here, the Board's\n\nfinding is supported by substantial evidence in the record.                No\n\nmore is exigible.\n\n            Taking a slightly different tack, the Hospital seizes on\n\nan   undisputed    fact:     that    Prospect   Hill   typically     furnished\n\ncustodial services, performing more sophisticated services only\n\nrarely.     Extrapolating from this fact, it contends that Prospect\n\nHill could not have operated as the equivalent of an SNF (which\n\noffers sophisticated nursing care as a staple). This strikes us as\n\nan oversimplification.\n\n            To be sure, Prospect Hill, in its heyday, was a Medicaid-\n\ncertified Level III nursing home that provided custodial care\n\nprimarily to psychiatric patients — but it also periodically\n\ndelivered skilled nursing, restorative care, and other therapeutic\n\nservices.    The TCC has a different orientation:         it is a Level II\n\nnursing     home    providing       mostly   rehabilitative     care     (and,\n\n\n\n\n                                      -26-\n\foccasionally, custodial care) to a wide variety of patients.7\n\nBased on these and other differences, the Hospital suggests three\n\nways in which the Board may have embarrassed the substantial\n\nevidence standard.      First, the Hospital asserts that because the\n\nnew provider exemption makes no explicit allowance for facilities\n\nas   disparate   as   Prospect   Hill   and   the   TCC,   such   facilities\n\nnecessarily must lie outside the ambit of the equivalency rubric.\n\nSecond, the Hospital contends that in order to be an equivalent of\n\nan SNF, a facility would have to meet the definition of an SNF —\n\nand Prospect Hill did not.       Third, the Hospital posits that, given\n\nthe underlying policy of the new provider exemption, Prospect\n\nHill's sporadic deployment of skilled nursing services simply does\n\nnot justify a finding of equivalency.\n\n           All three of these arguments miss the essential point.\n\nThe Secretary, in his discretion, reasonably could have looked not\n\n\n      7\n      These levels are part of a taxonomy developed by the\nCommonwealth with respect to its administration of the Medicaid\nprogram. The Commonwealth defines a Level III nursing home as a\nsupportive nursing care facility \"that provide[s] routine nursing\nservices and periodic availability of skilled nursing, restorative\nand other therapeutic services, as indicated, in addition to the\nminimum, basic care and services required for patients whose\ncondition is stabilized to the point that they need only supportive\nnursing care, supervision and observation.\" S. Shore II, 204 F.\nSupp. 2d at 78 n.12 (quoting Mass. Regs. Code tit. 105, § 151.020).\nIt defines a Level II nursing home as a skilled nursing care\nfacility \"that provide[s] continuous skilled care and meaningful\navailability of restorative services and other therapeutic services\nin addition to the minimum, basic care and services required for\npatients who show potential for improvement or restoration to a\nstabilized condition or who have a deteriorating condition\nrequiring skilled care.\" Id.\n\n                                    -27-\n\fat the particular level of care provided by a nursing facility,\n\nbut, rather, at a broader definition of equivalency.          Although our\n\nreview is geared to whether the Secretary's decision rests on\n\nsubstantial evidence, we must in the process defer to what the\n\nSecretary reasonably found to be relevant.          To do otherwise would\n\nfetter the Secretary's discretion in an unwarranted manner.                See\n\nVilla View Cmty. Hosp., Inc. v. Heckler, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"431801\"><a href=\"/opinion/431801/villa-view-community-hospital-inc-a-nonprofit-corporation-v-margaret-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">728</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">539</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 543 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1984); see also Mass. DPW, 984 F.2d at 527 (reiterating that\n\nthe court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the agency).\n\n             The Board accepted this premise — and reasonably so.          In\n\nthe process, it cited specifically to the nursing home reform\n\nprovisions    of    the   Omnibus   Budget   Reconciliation   Act   of    1987\n\ngoverning the certification of long-term care facilities under\n\nMedicare and Medicaid.        See Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of\n\n1987 (Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1987), Pub. L. No. 100-203, §§\n\n4211(a)(3) & (c), 4212(a) & (b), 4213(a), 4216, 101 Stat. 1330-182,\n\n-196, -204, -207, -212, -213, -220 (1987) (codified as amended at\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1395r).       These provisions indicate that both Medicare\n\nSNFs and Medicaid nursing facilities provide the same basic range\n\nof services.       See S. Shore I, supra, at *14, *17 (explaining that\n\nthese provisions require both Medicare SNFs and Medicaid nursing\n\nfacilities to provide the range of services described in sections\n\n1819(b)(4) and 1919(b)(4) of the Social Security Act).                   Thus,\n\nProspect Hill, as a Medicaid facility, \"would have already incurred\n\n\n                                     -28-\n\fthe start-up costs associated with the development of the capacity\n\nto furnish inpatient SNF services, by meeting the requirements for\n\nparticipation.\"        Id. at *2.\n\n              This is a convincing argument. Faced with it, we decline\n\nto substitute our judgment for the Secretary's as to whether so\n\nbroad-gauged a comparison contradicts the underlying purpose of\n\neither the challenged regulation or the enabling statute.                    In the\n\nlast    analysis,     Medicare      is     a     complex   and   highly   technical\n\nregulatory scheme, and courts should be hesitant to second-guess\n\nthe Secretary in such matters.                 See Thomas Jefferson, 512 U.S. at\n\n512; Cheshire Hosp. v. N.H.-Vt. Hosp'n Serv., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"409325\"><a href=\"/opinion/409325/cheshire-hospital-v-new-hampshire-vermont-hospitalization-service-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">689</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1112</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1117 (1st Cir. 1982); see also Villa View, 728 F.2d at 543\n\n(explaining that a court cannot reverse the Secretary's decision in\n\nsuch a case when doing so would require displacement of the\n\nSecretary's policy).          We therefore uphold the Board's finding of\n\nequivalency.\n\nV.    CONCLUSION\n\n              We need go no further.              Generic perceptions of reality\n\nare not the gold standard when administrative discretion is in\n\nplay.    Where Congress has chosen to cede substantial discretion to\n\nan agency, a reviewing court should scrutinize the administrative\n\nrecord    with      due    regard    for       that   discretion   and    weigh   the\n\nreasonableness of the Secretary's action accordingly.                     Mass. DPW,\n\n984    F.2d    at   522.      That    respectful        approach    is    especially\n\n\n                                           -29-\n\fappropriate when the challenged action — here, the interpretation\n\nof the new provider exemption — plainly calls for a delicate\n\nbalancing   of   a   melange    of   factors   within   the   scope   of   the\n\nSecretary's expertise.         Hewing to these precepts, we affirm the\n\nBoard's denial of the Hospital's application for a new provider\n\nexemption, reverse the district court's contrary decision, and\n\ndirect the entry of judgment in favor of the Secretary.\n\n\n\nReversed and remanded for the entry of judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -30-\n\f</pre>",
