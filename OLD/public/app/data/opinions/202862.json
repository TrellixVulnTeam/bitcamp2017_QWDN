Victor Josue Campos-Javier seeks review of\n\nan order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") rejecting his\n\nclaim   of    ineffective         assistance         of    counsel       in   the    removal\n\nproceedings against him.             We deny the petition.\n\n             Campos-Javier,          a   citizen      of    the    Dominican        Republic,\n\nentered    the     United      States    at    San    Juan,       Puerto      Rico    without\n\ninspection in 1994.            He soon married a United States citizen, who\n\nlater filed a visa application, known as an \"I-130,\" on his behalf\n\nin 1995.      See 8 U.S.C. § 1154(a)(1)(A)(i) (2007); 8 C.F.R. §\n\n204.2(a)(1) (2007).             After this application had been approved,\n\nCampos-Javier sought to adjust his immigration status to that of a\n\nlawful permanent resident, filing an \"I-485\" application.                              See 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1255(i) (2007); 8 C.F.R. §                        245.2 (2006).             But, in\n\nSeptember 1998, while that application was pending, his wife\n\nwithdrew     the   visa     application,        citing          \"domestic     violence    and\n\nbecause we have not lived together for a long time.\"1\n\n             Because      he    no   longer     had       the    visa,    Campos-Javier's\n\napplication for adjustment of status was denied on June 30, 2000.\n\nSee 8 C.F.R. § 245.1(c)(4).                   The INS simultaneously commenced\n\nremoval proceedings against him and took him into custody in Puerto\n\nRico.   Campos-Javier retained an attorney to represent him in the\n\nremoval proceedings. At the initial hearing before the immigration\n\n\n\n1\n The lawful status conferred by a visa can be revoked at any time\nfor \"good and sufficient cause.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1155 (2007).\n\n                                           -2-\n\fjudge (\"IJ\"), the attorney explained that Campos-Javier's wife, who\n\nwas at that time pregnant with their second child, would be willing\n\nto file another I-130 on his behalf, but that more time was needed\n\nto explore possible avenues of relief from removal.                  The IJ\n\ncontinued proceedings for one week.\n\n           When   they   reconvened,    Campos-Javier,    acting   through\n\ncounsel, made a request for voluntary departure.          The IJ granted\n\nit, giving Campos-Javier four months to leave the country.            See 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1229c(a)(1).      His attorney has since explained that she\n\ndid not pursue adjustment of status based on Campos-Javier's\n\nmarriage to an American citizen because, at that time, he no longer\n\nhad a visa \"immediately available\" as required for such relief.\n\nSee   8 U.S.C. § 1255(i)(2)(B).    The attorney recalls that she did\n\nask the IJ--off the record--to continue the proceedings so that\n\nanother I-130 visa application could be filed and processed, but\n\nthat the IJ denied the request.2        Campos-Javier's wife eventually\n\nfiled another I-130 application on his behalf, but not until May\n\n2003; it was approved in January 2005.\n\n           Campos-Javier did not comply with the voluntary departure\n\norder.   Instead, more than three years later, he filed a motion to\n\nreopen   the   removal   proceedings.     The   motion,   prepared    by   a\n\n\n\n2\n Though INS rules require off-the-record discussions at removal\nhearings to be summarized on-the-record, that did not occur here,\nat least according to the fragmentary transcript of the proceedings\nprovided to us.\n\n                                  -3-\n\fdifferent lawyer, claimed that Campos-Javier's prior counsel had\n\nprovided ineffective representation by failing to advise him of\n\nwhat he claimed was an opportunity to seek adjustment of status and\n\nby counseling him to seek voluntary departure instead.      The IJ\n\ndenied the motion to reopen, explaining that she was reluctant to\n\nsecond-guess the strategy of predecessor counsel.     The IJ also\n\nruled that, in any event, Campos-Javier had violated the voluntary\n\ndeparture order and therefore was barred from seeking adjustment of\n\nstatus for ten years.   8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d) (2007).\n\n          Campos-Javier appealed the denial of his motion to reopen\n\nto the BIA, which adopted and affirmed the IJ’s decision.   The BIA\n\nalso ruled that Campos-Javier had not complied with its procedural\n\nrequirements for prosecuting an ineffective assistance of counsel\n\nclaim as set forth in In re Lozada, 19 I. & N. Dec. 637 (BIA),\n\naff'd sub nom. Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\nSpecifically, the BIA found that Campos-Javier had not informed his\n\nformer attorney of the charge of ineffective assistance against her\n\nand provided her with an opportunity to respond.\n\n          Campos-Javier then filed a motion asking the BIA to\n\nreconsider its decision.   He argued that his prior counsel was, in\n\nfact, informed of his ineffective assistance claim, because he had\n\nfiled a complaint against her with the Disciplinary Committee of\n\nthe United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico,\n\nwhich, in turn, would have provided her with notice of the claim.\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fCampos-Javier also explained that he had not complied with the\n\nvoluntary departure order because of the hardship that leaving the\n\ncountry would cause his wife and children.\n\n            The BIA denied the motion to reconsider, concluding that\n\nthe motion failed to identify any error of law or fact in the BIA's\n\nprevious decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). Campos-Javier sought\n\nfurther relief by filing a petition for writ of habeas corpus in\n\nthe United States District Court for the Southern District of New\n\nYork.    While the petition was pending, however, the REAL ID Act\n\ntook effect, resulting in the transfer of the case to this court.\n\nREAL ID Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-13, Div. B, § 106(c), 119\n\nStat. 231, 311.     We treat the transferred habeas petition as a\n\npetition for review of a final order of removal under 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1252.    See, e.g., Grigous v. Gonzales, 460 F.3d 156, 159 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).\n\n            Campos-Javier argues that the BIA should have granted his\n\nmotion to reconsider because he \"substantially complied\" with the\n\nprocedural requirements for making an ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel claim set forth in Lozada.     We review the BIA's denial of\n\na motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion.    Zhang v. INS, 348\n\nF.3d 289, 293 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n            The BIA refused to reconsider its decision that Campos-\n\nJavier had failed to satisfy one of the Lozada prerequisites to an\n\nineffective assistance of counsel claim.    Those prerequisites are:\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f     (1) an affidavit describing in detail the agreement\n     between the alien and his counsel regarding the\n     litigation matters the attorney was retained to address;\n     (2) evidence that the alien informed his counsel as to\n     the alien’s ineffective assistance allegations and\n     afforded counsel an opportunity to respond; and (3)\n     evidence that the alien had either filed a complaint with\n     the appropriate disciplinary authority regarding the\n     attorney’s ethical or legal misfeasance, or a valid\n     excuse for failing to lodge such a complaint.\n\nBetouche v. Ashcroft, 357 F.3d 147, 149 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting\n\nLozada, 19 I. & N. Dec. at 639).          We have recognized that the BIA\n\nadopted these requirements \"to enable the efficient screening of\n\nfrivolous, collusive or dilatory claims\" of ineffective assistance.\n\nWang v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 25, 27 (1st Cir. 2004).               We have also\n\nrecognized, then, that the BIA may hold a petitioner to the Lozada\n\nrequirements, provided it does so in a non-arbitrary manner.                  See,\n\ne.g., Zeng v. Gonzales, 436 F.3d 26, 31 (1st Cir. 2006); Asaba v.\n\nAshcroft, 377 F.3d 9, 10 (1st Cir. 2004); Betouche, 357 F.3d at 149\n\nn.2; Saakian v. INS, 252 F.3d 21, 26 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n           Here,    the     BIA   rejected    Campos-Javier's     ineffective\n\nassistance claim under Lozada because he had not informed his\n\nformer attorney of the allegations against her and allowed her the\n\nopportunity to respond to them. Campos-Javier argues, as he did in\n\nhis motion to reconsider, that lodging those allegations with the\n\nDisciplinary      Committee       functionally     satisfied     the     notice\n\nrequirement, because the Committee itself would have provided the\n\nattorney   with    the    opportunity    to   respond.    But   we    expressly\n\nrejected   this    argument    in   Betouche,    where   we   found    that   the\n\n                                        -6-\n\fpetitioner had not notified his lawyer within the contemplation of\n\nLozada by filing a complaint against him with the Massachusetts\n\nBoard of Bar Overseers.      357 F.3d at 151.        There, we reasoned that\n\nthe filing \"simply established that [the petitioner] had notified\n\nthe Board of Bar Overseers of his complaint, not that either he or\n\nthe Board had notified [prior counsel].\"         Id.\n\n            The   same   reasoning    applies   here,        where    the   record\n\nprovides no indication that the Disciplinary Committee notified\n\nCampos-Javier's former attorney of his complaint.                    In fact, the\n\nCommittee responded to the complaint by asking Campos-Javier to\n\nprovide \"the actual case number\" so that it could \"answer his\n\nquestion\"--but he did not respond to the Committee until more than\n\nfive months later, right after the BIA had already denied his\n\nmotion to reopen because, inter alia, there was no evidence that he\n\nnotified his prior counsel of his ineffective assistance claim as\n\ndictated by Lozada.      Moreover, even when Campos-Javier moved for\n\nreconsideration of this ruling, he did not apprise the BIA of his\n\nresponse to the Committee.       So we cannot consider the effect of\n\nthat response, if any, on the question of whether the Committee in\n\nfact notified his previous attorney of the complaint; the response\n\nwas never made part of the record before the BIA.               See Asaba, 377\n\nF.3d at 12; Betouche, 357 F.3d at 151.\n\n            Though   Campos-Javier     relies   on    the     Committee's    rule\n\naffording   an    attorney   facing    allegations      of    misconduct     \"the\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fopportunity   to   be     heard,\"    that      rule   applies   only    when   such\n\nallegations, \"if substantiated, would warrant discipline on the\n\npart of an attorney admitted to practice before this Court.\"\n\nD.P.R. R. 85.3(b).       So the rule alone provides no basis for finding\n\nthat the Committee actually notified prior counsel of Campos-\n\nJavier's complaint and, as we have noted, the record is devoid of\n\nany other materials supporting that conclusion.\n\n           Furthermore, as we held in Asaba, Lozada demands that\n\ncounsel targeted by an ineffective assistance claim \"be provided an\n\nopportunity to respond before filing the motion to reopen.\"                    377\n\nF.3d at 12 (emphasis added).             In this way, \"[t]he Lozada notice\n\nrequirement provides a mechanism by which the [IJ] and the BIA 'may\n\nmore accurately assess the merits of a petitioner's ineffective\n\nassistance claim.'\" Id. (quoting Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592,\n\n599 (9th Cir. 2004)).         That mechanism cannot function when the\n\nattorney   does    not    learn     of   her    former   client's      ineffective\n\nassistance claim until after the BIA has decided whether to grant\n\nreopening on that basis.          Even if we could conclude that Campos-\n\nJavier's response to the Committee resulted in notice to his\n\nprevious attorney, then, that notice still would have come too late\n\nto satisfy Lozada.       See Asaba, 377 F.3d at 12.\n\n           Finally, Campos-Javier argues that he should not have\n\nbeen held to \"strict adherence\" to the notice requirement, because\n\nhis failure to honor it was \"beyond [his] control\" in light of his\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fdifficult family circumstances at the time he sought reopening.\n\nThough we have assumed that the \"Lozada requirements might be\n\nexcused where [the] alien demonstrated diligent (albeit deficient)\n\nefforts to comply,\" Betouche, 357 F.3d at 150 (citing Ontiveros-\n\nLopez v. INS, 213 F.3d 1121, 1124-25 (9th Cir. 2000)), we cannot\n\nconsider   such   an   argument   here,   because   Campos-Javier   never\n\npresented it to the BIA.          See, e.g., Molina De Massenet v.\n\nGonzales, 485 F.3d 661, 664 (1st Cir. 2007).           The petition for\n\nreview is denied.\n\n     So Ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\f",

The IJ also\n\nruled that, in any event, Campos-Javier had violated the voluntary\n\ndeparture order and therefore was barred from seeking adjustment of\n\nstatus for ten years.   8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d) (2007).\n\n          Campos-Javier appealed the denial of his motion to reopen\n\nto the BIA, which adopted and affirmed the IJ’s decision.   The BIA\n\nalso ruled that Campos-Javier had not complied with its procedural\n\nrequirements for prosecuting an ineffective assistance of counsel\n\nclaim as set forth in In re Lozada, 19 I. & N.

He argued that his prior counsel was, in\n\nfact, informed of his ineffective assistance claim, because he had\n\nfiled a complaint against her with the Disciplinary Committee of\n\nthe United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico,\n\nwhich, in turn, would have provided her with notice of the claim.\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fCampos-Javier also explained that he had not complied with the\n\nvoluntary departure order because of the hardship that leaving the\n\ncountry would cause his wife and children.\n\n            The BIA denied the motion to reconsider, concluding that\n\nthe motion failed to identify any error of law or fact in the BIA's\n\nprevious decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). Campos-Javier sought\n\nfurther relief by filing a petition for writ of habeas corpus in\n\nthe United States District Court for the Southern District of New\n\nYork.    While the petition was pending, however, the REAL ID Act\n\ntook effect, resulting in the transfer of the case to this court.\n\nREAL ID Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-13, Div.

Campos-Javier argues, as he did in\n\nhis motion to reconsider, that lodging those allegations with the\n\nDisciplinary      Committee       functionally     satisfied     the     notice\n\nrequirement, because the Committee itself would have provided the\n\nattorney   with    the    opportunity    to   respond.    But   we    expressly\n\nrejected   this    argument    in   Betouche,    where   we   found    that   the\n\n                                        -6-\n\fpetitioner had not notified his lawyer within the contemplation of\n\nLozada by filing a complaint against him with the Massachusetts\n\nBoard of Bar Overseers.      357 F.3d at 151.        There, we reasoned that\n\nthe filing \"simply established that [the petitioner] had notified\n\nthe Board of Bar Overseers of his complaint, not that either he or\n\nthe Board had notified [prior counsel].\"         Id.\n\n            The   same   reasoning    applies   here,        where    the   record\n\nprovides no indication that the Disciplinary Committee notified\n\nCampos-Javier's former attorney of his complaint.                    In fact, the\n\nCommittee responded to the complaint by asking Campos-Javier to\n\nprovide \"the actual case number\" so that it could \"answer his\n\nquestion\"--but he did not respond to the Committee until more than\n\nfive months later, right after the BIA had already denied his\n\nmotion to reopen because, inter alia, there was no evidence that he\n\nnotified his prior counsel of his ineffective assistance claim as\n\ndictated by Lozada.      Moreover, even when Campos-Javier moved for\n\nreconsideration of this ruling, he did not apprise the BIA of his\n\nresponse to the Committee.       So we cannot consider the effect of\n\nthat response, if any, on the question of whether the Committee in\n\nfact notified his previous attorney of the complaint; the response\n\nwas never made part of the record before the BIA.               See Asaba, 377\n\nF.3d at 12; Betouche, 357 F.3d at 151.\n\n            Though   Campos-Javier     relies   on    the     Committee's    rule\n\naffording   an    attorney   facing    allegations      of    misconduct     \"the\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fopportunity   to   be     heard,\"    that      rule   applies   only    when   such\n\nallegations, \"if substantiated, would warrant discipline on the\n\npart of an attorney admitted to practice before this Court.\"\n\nD.P.R. R. 85.3(b).       So the rule alone provides no basis for finding\n\nthat the Committee actually notified prior counsel of Campos-\n\nJavier's complaint and, as we have noted, the record is devoid of\n\nany other materials supporting that conclusion.\n\n           Furthermore, as we held in Asaba, Lozada demands that\n\ncounsel targeted by an ineffective assistance claim \"be provided an\n\nopportunity to respond before filing the motion to reopen.\"                    377\n\nF.3d at 12 (emphasis added).             In this way, \"[t]he Lozada notice\n\nrequirement provides a mechanism by which the [IJ] and the BIA 'may\n\nmore accurately assess the merits of a petitioner's ineffective\n\nassistance claim.'\" Id. (quoting Reyes v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785130\"><a href=\"/opinion/785130/pedro-vilarde-reyes-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">358</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">592</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n599 (9th Cir. 2004)).         That mechanism cannot function when the\n\nattorney   does    not    learn     of   her    former   client's      ineffective\n\nassistance claim until after the BIA has decided whether to grant\n\nreopening on that basis.          Even if we could conclude that Campos-\n\nJavier's response to the Committee resulted in notice to his\n\nprevious attorney, then, that notice still would have come too late\n\nto satisfy Lozada.       See Asaba, 377 F.3d at 12.\n\n           Finally, Campos-Javier argues that he should not have\n\nbeen held to \"strict adherence\" to the notice requirement, because\n\nhis failure to honor it was \"beyond [his] control\" in light of his\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fdifficult family circumstances at the time he sought reopening.\n\nThough we have assumed that the \"Lozada requirements might be\n\nexcused where [the] alien demonstrated diligent (albeit deficient)\n\nefforts to comply,\" Betouche, 357 F.3d at 150 (citing Ontiveros-\n\nLopez v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768874\"><a href=\"/opinion/768874/bernardo-ontiveros-lopez-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">213</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1121</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1124-25 (9th Cir. 2000)), we cannot\n\nconsider   such   an   argument   here,   because   Campos-Javier   never\n\npresented it to the BIA.
