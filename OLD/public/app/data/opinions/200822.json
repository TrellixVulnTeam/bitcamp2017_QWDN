This case arises from a dispute\n\nbetween    appellant    Royal   Maccabees    Life      Insurance   Company    and\n\nappellee    Rita   Foisy,   who      purchased    an    annuity    policy    from\n\nMaccabees.     Foisy received sixty months of annuity payments, but\n\nclaims that under the terms of the policy, she was entitled to\n\nlifetime payments. Maccabees disagrees, contending that the policy\n\nshe purchased provides only the sixty months of benefits and\n\nnothing further.       Foisy filed suit in Massachusetts state court,\n\nand Maccabees removed to federal court on the basis of diversity.1\n\nA jury trial resulted in a verdict for Foisy on claims of breach of\n\ncontract and negligent misrepresentation.               On appeal, Maccabees\n\nchallenges the timeliness of Foisy's action and the evidentiary\n\nbasis for the jury verdict.          We affirm the district court on all\n\ncounts.\n\n                                I.   Background\n\n     In 1994, seventy-six year old Rita Foisy consulted her son-in-\n\nlaw, Gerald Healy, about how she might use $40,000 received from\n\nher late husband's life insurance to secure an income stream for\n\nherself.     Healy, an independent licensed insurance broker and\n\ncredentialed    financial   consultant,      agreed      to   research   annuity\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      In accordance with 28 U.S.C. ยง 636(c) and Fed. R. Civ. P.\n73(b), the parties consented to a magistrate judge's conduct of all\nproceedings in the case, including jury trial and entry of the\nfinal judgment, with direct review by this court.\n\n                                       -2-\n\fproducts on her behalf.             Healy contacted Bader Insurance Agency,2\n\nwith       whom   he    had   an   established   business    relationship,3    for\n\ninformation        on    annuity    policies.    Bader,     in   turn,   contacted\n\nMaccabees.\n\n       In response to Bader's inquiry, Maccabees provided three\n\n\"illustrations\" of annuity policies for Foisy, each detailing a\n\ndifferent scenario available for a $40,000 premium.                 Bader passed\n\nthe illustrations on to Healy, who then met with Foisy to explain\n\nthe various policy options.            Foisy elected what both she and Healy\n\nbelieved to be an annuity that provided lifetime monthly payments\n\nof $710.99, including a guaranteed minimum of 60 payments totaling\n\n$42,659.40.            Healy and Foisy understood that should Foisy die\n\nbefore the minimum 60 payments, her beneficiary received the\n\nremainder of the guaranteed sum; if Foisy died after the 60 minimum\n\npayments, the annuity would simply cease with her death and there\n\nwould be no payment to the beneficiary.                   Healy filled out the\n\nportion of the annuity application reserved for writing agents (and\n\nin the process applied for an agent's license from Maccabees),\n\nFoisy signed the application, and the monthly payments began in May\n\n1994.\n\n\n       2\n      Bader Insurance Agency held general agency contracts with a\nnumber of insurers, and in turn sought writing agents to sell the\nproducts of those insurers to consumers.\n       3\n      Bader and Healy routinely did business together; Healy\nfrequently approached Bader with requests for product information\non behalf of his - Healy's - clients.\n\n                                         -3-\n\f     Foisy received exactly the benefits she expected until, in the\n\nfall of 1999, she began bouncing checks and discovered that the\n\nannuity payments that had been deposited directly into her checking\n\naccount had stopped in May.   When Healy contacted Maccabees on her\n\nbehalf,4 the company maintained that Foisy's policy provided only\n\n60 monthly payments, nothing thereafter, and that the provisions of\n\nthe contract had thus been fulfilled.5\n\n     Healy's efforts to persuade Maccabees that the policy provided\n\nlifetime benefits failed, and Foisy subsequently filed suit.   She\n\nreceived a jury verdict in her favor on counts of breach of\n\ncontract and negligent misrepresentation, and was awarded damages\n\nof $29,150.20 and $20,000, respectively.   Although Maccabees pled\n\nthe statute of limitations as a defense, at the close of evidence\n\nthe district court determined as a matter of law that Foisy's\n\n\n\n     4\n      Maccabees was acquired by another company in 1999; the\nadministration of all contracts issued outside of New York was\ntransferred to a third party in Texas, initially called Cybertech\nand subsequently Reassure America.      We will refer only to\nMaccabees, rather than any of the successor entities.\n     5\n      In insurance industry parlance, Foisy believed she had\npurchased a \"certain and continuous\" annuity while Maccabees\nmaintained the policy was a \"certain only\" annuity. A certain and\ncontinuous annuity provides a minimum number of guaranteed\npayments, regardless of whether the annuitant dies before the\nminimum payments are complete.     If the annuitant outlives the\nguaranteed minimum, payments will continue for life, ending upon\nthe death of the annuitant.     A certain only annuity yields a\nspecified number of payments and nothing beyond. A third option,\nonly tangentially relevant here, is the lifetime annuity, in which\nthe annuitant receives payments for life, with no guaranteed\nminimum.\n\n                                -4-\n\fclaims     were   timely,   and   thus    the    jury   did   not   consider   any\n\nlimitations issues.         The district court denied Maccabees' post-\n\ntrial motions for judgment as a matter of law or in the alternative\n\na new trial.\n\n     Maccabees appeals the district court's judgment on multiple\n\ngrounds. First, the company objects to the court's decision on the\n\nstatute of limitations, arguing that it is entitled to judgment as\n\na matter of law because the claims were barred or, at a minimum,\n\nthe jury should have decided the limitations question.                   Second,\n\nwith respect to the contract claim, Maccabees contests the district\n\ncourt's decision to allow the jury to interpret disputed language\n\nin   the    policy.     According        to    Maccabees,     the   contract   was\n\nunambiguous and should have been interpreted in its favor by the\n\njudge. The company further claims that, in any event, the evidence\n\nwas insufficient to support a finding of breach.                Third, Maccabees\n\nattacks the evidentiary basis for the negligent misrepresentation\n\nverdict, claiming that there is no support for the jury's finding\n\nthat Healy was Maccabees' agent and that Foisy reasonably relied on\n\nHealy's statements.\n\n      Maccabees bears a heavy burden in seeking relief from the\n\njudgment below.       In reviewing a denial of judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw, we examine the evidence in favor of Foisy, the non-moving\n\nparty.     Marrero v. Goya of Puerto Rico, Inc., 304 F.3d 7, 14 (1st\n\nCir. 2002).        Although our review of the court's decision is\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fplenary, our scrutiny of the jury verdict is tightly circumscribed;\n\nwe will reverse only \"if a reasonable person could not have reached\n\nthe conclusion of the jury.\" White v. New Hampshire Dep't of\n\nCorrections, 221 F.3d 254, 259 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n     We review denial of a motion for new trial for abuse of\n\ndiscretion, a similarly stringent standard which recognizes that a\n\ndistrict court should grant such a motion \"only if the verdict is\n\nagainst the demonstrable weight of the credible evidence or results\n\nin a blatant miscarriage of justice.\"        Sanchez v. Puerto Rico Oil\n\nCo., 37 F.3d 712, 717 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n                     II.   Statute of Limitations\n\n     Maccabees asserts that the statute of limitations began to run\n\non both claims when Foisy purchased the policy in April 1994.\n\nAccording to the company, the six-year limitations period for\n\ncontract claims and three-year limitations period for negligent\n\nmisrepresentation claims had passed by the time Foisy filed suit in\n\nMarch 2001.\n\n     Under Massachusetts law, which applies in this diversity case,\n\ncontract claims generally accrue at breach.               Saenger Org. v.\n\nNationwide Ins. Licensing Assocs., 119 F.3d 55, 64 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\nSimilarly, tort claims accrue at the time of injury.          Tagliente v.\n\nHimmer, 949 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1991).            Under the Massachusetts\n\ndiscovery   rule,   however,   a   claim   will    not   accrue   until   the\n\nplaintiff \"knows of the cause of action or         . . . should have known\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fof the cause of action.\"          Riley v. Presnell, 409 Mass. 239, 244,\n\n565 N.E.2d 780, 785 (1991).\n\n       We are unpersuaded by Maccabees' argument that our decision in\n\nLoguidice v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 336 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2003),\n\nrequires us to find that Foisy had knowledge of her claims as far\n\nback   as   1994.     In    Loguidice,    despite    a   sympathetic        factual\n\nbackground    in    which   an    unsavory   insurance        agent    misled   the\n\nplaintiff into believing she purchased a retirement plan when in\n\nfact she purchased life insurance, we held that the claims were\n\nbarred because the language of the policy clearly indicated it was\n\nlife insurance, thus putting the plaintiff on inquiry notice of her\n\nclaim.      See id. at 7.        Here, however, because the language in\n\nMaccabees' policy is ambiguous, see infra at 12, Foisy could not be\n\nexpected to have had knowledge of a particular construction of the\n\npolicy.\n\n       For the same reason, Maccabees' reliance on Quigley v. Unum\n\nLife Ins. Co., 688 F. Supp. 80 (D. Mass. 1988), is misplaced.                   The\n\nQuigley plaintiffs' contract and negligent misrepresentation claims\n\nwere barred because the contract's coverage was ascertainable had\n\nthe plaintiffs performed annuity calculations.                Maccabees suggests\n\nthat, a fortiori, the relative simplicity of the six-page Maccabees\n\npolicy requires a finding that Foisy should have known that she\n\npurchased a policy different from what she intended.                    Maccabees,\n\nhowever, confuses      brevity     with   clarity.       It    is     the   policy's\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fambiguity - unmitigated by the relatively short length - that made\n\nFoisy's claim unknowable until 1999.\n\n      Even absent a favorable ruling on its motion for judgment as\n\na matter of law, Maccabees contends that, at the very least, the\n\nquestion of accrual was for the jury to decide.      See Taygeta Corp.\n\nv. Varian Assoc., 436 Mass. 217, 229, 763 N.E.2d 1053, 1063 (2002)\n\n(\"In most instances, the question when a plaintiff knew or should\n\nhave known of its cause of action is one of fact that will be\n\ndecided by the trier of fact.\").        Having been deprived of jury\n\nconsideration on a material issue, Maccabees argues it is entitled\n\nto a new trial.   Acknowledging that the court's decision to rule on\n\nthe issue as a matter of law was a close call, we nevertheless\n\naffirm. In light of the jury's verdict, that decision was at worst\n\nharmless error.\n\n      Since the jury found that the contract was a life annuity - a\n\nverdict which we uphold, see infra at 14 - there could be no\n\nbreach, and therefore no accrual of the contract claim, until after\n\nMay 1999, when Maccabees stopped making monthly payments.            The\n\ncontract action, filed two years later, was thus timely.       Although\n\nthe   negligent   misrepresentation    claim   deserves   slightly   more\n\nattention, in the end Foisy prevails here as well.\n\n      Under the Massachusetts discovery rule, the limitations period\n\non a tort claim will not commence until a plaintiff is able to\n\nrecognize some causal connection between the defendant's actions\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fand her injury.    See, e.g., Szymanski v. Boston Mut. Life Ins. Co.,\n\n56 Mass. App. Ct. 367, 370-71, 778 N.E.2d 16, 20 (2002).      In other\n\nwords, Foisy's claim for negligent misrepresentation could not have\n\naccrued if the factual basis for it was \"inherently unknowable.\"\n\nCollins v. Nuzzo, 244 F.3d 246, 253 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n      We assume for purposes of analyzing this issue that the\n\ncontract did not provide a lifetime annuity, and that Healy's\n\nstatements to that effect thus were false.6     Foisy argues that she\n\ncould not have known that her understanding was incorrect because\n\nthe   contract's    ambiguous   language   reasonably   supported   her\n\ninterpretation.    We agree.\n\n      The district court's threshold finding that the policy was\n\nambiguous means that she could not be held to knowledge of her\n\nclaim until 1999, when the payments stopped.       We agree with the\n\ndistrict court that no other circumstances existed to put her on\n\nnotice that the company's interpretation differed substantially\n\nfrom her own.7\n\n\n      6\n      The jury's verdict in favor of Foisy on both claims rests on\nthe contradictory factual predicate that the contract was - for\npurposes of the contract claim - a certain and continuous policy,\nbut that - for purposes of the negligent misrepresentation claim -\nit was a certain only policy.    We see no grounds, however, for\ndisturbing the verdict on the basis of that inconsistency.\nSee infra at 14 n.8.\n      7\n      Contrary to Maccabees' contention at oral argument, the\nambiguity itself did not put Foisy on notice. As discussed infra,\nthe    ambiguity   here   yielded    two   different,   plausible\ninterpretations. If that were sufficient to put a plaintiff on\nnotice, an insurer could too easily wield ambiguity to avoid\n\n                                  -9-\n\f      We affirm the district court's denial of Maccabees' motion for\n\njudgment as a matter of law based on the statute of limitations, as\n\nwell as the motion for new trial.\n\n                              III.    Contract Claim\n\n      Maccabees contends that interpretation of the annuity policy\n\nwas a question of law for the trial judge and, furthermore, that\n\nthe evidence fails to support the jury verdict.\n\n          Maccabees correctly notes that construction of an insurance\n\ncontract is generally a question of law.               See Ruggerio Ambulance\n\nServ. v. Nat'l Grange Mut. Ins. Co., 430 Mass. 794, 797, 724 N.E.2d\n\n295, 298 (2000).          Acknowledging in passing that disputed facts\n\nbearing on interpretation may be submitted to the jury, see Vergato\n\nv. Commercial Union Ins. Co., 50 Mass. App. Ct. 824, 826, 741\n\nN.E.2d     486,    488   (2001),     Maccabees    continues   to   rely   on    its\n\nassertion that the contract unambiguously provides a \"certain only\"\n\nannuity, and should have been interpreted as such by the court as\n\na matter of law.         Foisy's contradictory reading of the contract is\n\nof   no    consequence      under    Maccabees'    argument   because     a    mere\n\ncontroversy over interpretation is not, by itself, enough to create\n\nambiguity.        See Center for Blood Research v. Coregis Ins. Co., 305\n\n\nlitigating the merits under the much less favorable rule that\nambiguities are construed in favor of the insured. See Utica Mut.\nIns. Co. v. Weathermark Investments, Inc., 292 F.3d 77, 80 (1st\nCir. 2002); Cody v. Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co., 387 Mass. 142,\n146, 439 N.E.2d 234, 237 (1982).     We do not decide under what\ncircumstances a patent or flagrant ambiguity would put a plaintiff\non notice.\n\n                                        -10-\n\fF.3d 38, 41 (1st Cir. 2002)(citing County of Barnstable v. Am. Fin.\n\nCorp., 51 Mass. App. Ct. 213, 215, 744 N.E.2d 1107, 1109 (2001)).\n\n\n\n     The rule of interpretation, however, has more nuance than\n\nMaccabees suggests.    If, upon \"application of pertinent rules of\n\nconstruction,\" the district court makes a threshold determination\n\nof ambiguity, and thus also finds that extrinsic evidence is\n\nnecessary to resolve the dispute, then a question of fact arises to\n\nbe resolved by the jury.     2 Couch on Insurance ยง 21:13 (3d ed.\n\n1999); see also Utica Mut. Ins. Co. v. Weathermark Investments,\n\nInc., 292 F.3d 77, 80 (1st Cir. 2002)(\"Only where a contractual\n\nterm is ambiguous does its interpretation pose a question of fact\n\n. . . [and] the parties may adduce extrinsic evidence of their\n\nrespective intendments.\").        A court may make such a threshold\n\nfinding of ambiguity if the contractual language is \"susceptible of\n\nmore than one meaning and reasonably intelligent persons [could]\n\ndiffer as to which meaning is the proper one.\" Center for Blood\n\nResearch, 305 F.3d at 41.\n\n     Contrary   to   Maccabees'    allegations,   the   district   court\n\nundertook an appropriate preliminary analysis of the contract prior\n\nto sending it to the jury.        Upon Maccabees' motion for summary\n\njudgment based on expiration of the limitations period, the court\n\ncarefully considered the substance of the policy.            Construing\n\ndisputed provisions in the contract, the judge determined that both\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fMaccabees    and   Foisy    offered   reasonable     interpretations.         As\n\nMaccabees stressed, the annuity benefits schedule listed total\n\nannuity benefits of $42,659.40 and annuity payments certain lasting\n\n60 months.    Conversely, Foisy highlighted language in the contract\n\nspecifying that \"[e]xcept as stated under Death of Owner, the\n\nAnnuity     Payments     will   end   with   the    death    of   the     owner.\"\n\nSignificantly,     the    court   observed   that    the    \"Death   of    Owner\"\n\nprovision did not address the situation at hand, in which the\n\nannuitant outlived the payments certain.            The controversy between\n\nFoisy and Maccabees arose from a genuine ambiguity in the contract,\n\nand the district court properly determined that the intent of the\n\nparties was therefore a question of fact suitable for trial.                  See\n\nSeaco Ins. Co. v. Barbosa, 435 Mass. 772, 779, 761 N.E.2d 946, 951\n\n(2002).\n\n     Maccabees also seeks to overturn the jury verdict, contending\n\nthat the evidence at trial supported only the conclusion that the\n\npolicy provided 60 months of payments and nothing further.                  Each\n\nparty, however, presented expert testimony supporting a different\n\ninterpretation of the policy.            John Stiefel, Foisy's expert,\n\noffered his opinion that, based on a review of the document, Foisy\n\npurchased a continuous and certain annuity providing lifetime\n\nbenefits.    Stiefel supported his opinion with cogent and pertinent\n\nobservations about the document, including use of the phrase \"life\n\nannuity\" in the title and the lack of any reference to an end date\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\ffor payments.   He also suggested that retired individuals like\n\nFoisy usually elect lifetime, rather than certain only, annuities\n\nbecause the primary motivation for purchase of the policy is to\n\nensure that the retiree does not outlive his or her income.\n\nButtressing the expert's opinion, Foisy and Healy each testified\n\nthat they intended to apply for a policy providing a lifetime\n\nannuity.   In short, there was substantial evidence on which the\n\njury could have based its verdict.\n\n     None of Maccabees' contradictory evidence compelled the jurors\n\nto reject Foisy's position.   Other than an annuity expert to rebut\n\nFoisy's expert, the only witness presented by Maccabees was a\n\nformer marketing employee, Nancy Pietrowski, who, although well-\n\nversed in the company's usual procedure in providing illustrations\n\nto agents, had no particular recollection of the transaction with\n\nFoisy. With respect to expert opinion, Maccabees' expert testified\n\nthat he interpreted the contract as a \"certain only\" annuity.   But\n\nneither party's expert was impeached, and it is well within the\n\njury's prerogative to accept the testimony of Foisy's expert over\n\nthat of the company's.\n\n     Although we cannot precisely ascertain each individual juror's\n\nrationale for finding one expert's testimony more credible than\n\nthat of another, the record reveals Maccabees' somewhat strained\n\nattempt to convince a jury to favor its proffered interpretation -\n\npieced together through multiple cross references - over the more\n\n\n                               -13-\n\fstraightforward argument that a document which says \"life annuity\"\n\non the cover is in fact just that.          Particularly in light of the\n\nrule - recited in the jury instructions - that \"if there are two\n\nrational   interpretations    of   policy    language,   the   insured    is\n\nentitled to the benefit of the one that is more favorable to it,\"\n\nHazen Paper Co. v. U.S. Fid. and Guar. Co., 407 Mass. 689, 700, 555\n\nN.E.2d 576, 583 (1990), we see no cause to find fault with the jury\n\nverdict on the contract claim.\n\n     The district court properly denied Maccabees' motion for\n\njudgment as a matter of law on the contract claim.\n\n                 IV.   Negligent Misrepresentation\n\n     Maccabees' final ground of appeal is that the negligent\n\nmisrepresentation    claim   fails   because    the   evidence   does    not\n\ndemonstrate   that   Healy   was   Maccabees'    agent   and   that   Foisy\n\nreasonably relied on Healy's representations about the policy.8\n\n\n     8\n      The foundation for the negligent misrepresentation claim is\nthat Maccabees, through Healy, represented that the policy provided\nlifetime benefits when, in fact, it did not.      We note that, in\ndetermining that Maccabees breached the contract, the jury had to\nfind that the policy was a certain and continuous life annuity. It\nwould therefore seem that any statement by Healy to that effect\ncould not be false, meaning that an essential element of the\nnegligent misrepresentation claim was lacking.         Counsel for\nMaccabees objected to giving any instruction at all on negligent\nmisrepresentation, based on alleged lack of evidence, but did not\nobject - either before the instructions were submitted to the jury\nor prior to the jury's discharge after rendering a verdict - on the\nbasis of inconsistency. See Howard v. Antilla, 294 F.3d 244, 247\nn.6, 250 (1st Cir. 2002)(barring objection to inconsistent verdict\nwhen not raised before discharge of the jury and noting further\nthat appellant failed to object to use of the jury form permitting\nsuch inconsistency).     We thus proceed with discussion of the\n\n                                   -14-\n\f       The jury was asked to make a threshold finding on agency by\n\nevaluating four factors:         who called Healy to the transaction, who\n\ncontrolled his actions, who paid him, and whose interests he\n\nattempted to protect.          The judge further explained that although\n\nthis        initial   agency   question   was   important,   it   was   not\n\ndeterminative of the claim.           Foisy could still prevail if she\n\ndemonstrated that she relied on false statements in the annuity\n\ndocuments themselves.          Because there is insufficient evidence in\n\nthe record suggesting that Foisy relied primarily on the documents\n\n- rather than on Healy's statements - in forming her opinion of the\n\npolicy's content,9 we consider the negligent misrepresentation\n\nclaim only by way of Healy's alleged agency.\n\n       Whether an individual has acted as an agent is a question of\n\nfact.       Pedersen v. Leahy, 397 Mass. 689, 691, 493 N.E.2d 486, 487\n\n(1986).       Maccabees contends that under Hudson v. Mass. Prop. Ins.\n\nUnderwriting Assoc., 386 Mass. 450, 455, 436 N.E.2d 155, 158\n\n(1982)(citations omitted), a broker \"is ordinarily the agent of the\n\ninsured\" while an insurance agent usually is deemed to represent\n\nthe insurer.10        See also Couch, supra, at ยง 45:5 (\"Absent some\n\n\nnegligent misrepresentation claim as if it did not conflict with\nthe jury's finding on the contract claim.\n       9\n      The only testimony on whether Foisy read the policy was her\nown somewhat equivocal statement, \"Well, I don't know - there's so\nmuch on those policies, you don't read all the fine print.\"\n       10\n      The industry distinction between \"broker\" and \"agent\" has the\npotential to engender confusion with the legal principle of agency.\n\n                                      -15-\n\fspecial condition or circumstance in the particular case, a broker\n\nis not an agent of the insurer . . . .\").                     By Massachusetts\n\nstatute, a broker \"acts or aids in any manner in negotiating\n\npolicies of insurance or annuity . . . for a person other than\n\nhimself,\" while an agent \"solicits insurance on behalf of any\n\ncompany,    or    transmits   for    a     person   other    than   himself    an\n\napplication for . . . an annuity . . . to or from such company.\"\n\nMass. Gen. L. ch. 175 ยง 162.         At the most rudimentary level, this\n\ndistinction means that a broker acts as the \"middleman\" between\n\ninsured and insurer, and will not be under the employ of any\n\nparticular insurance company.         Michelson v. Franklin Fire Ins. Co.\n\nof Philadelphia, 252 Mass. 336, 359, 147 N.E. 851, 852 (1925); see\n\nalso Couch, supra, at ยง 45:1.\n\n     As the statutory definitions indicate, however, the title of\n\nbroker or agent will not always identify the principal.                        An\n\nindividual may be considered a broker in the general sense, for\n\nexample, but nevertheless with respect to a specific transaction be\n\nthe agent of the insurer.             See Am. Country Ins. v. Bernhard\n\nWoodwork,   412    Mass.   734,     740,   592   N.E.2d     1319,   1323   (1992)\n\n(applying Illinois law, but utilizing the same agency factors\n\nconsidered by the jury in the current case).              When evaluating the\n\nrole of an individual who assumes the characteristics of both agent\n\n\nWith respect to representative capacity, both a broker and an agent\nmay be vested with agency authority; the question is whether the\ninsured or the insurer is the principal.\n\n                                      -16-\n\fand broker, we must \"look to the agent's conduct in the relevant\n\ntransaction to determine the nature of the various relationships.\"\n\nId. at 740.\n\n     Healy testified to having three relevant conversations with\n\nFoisy over the course of the transaction.               The first occurred when\n\nFoisy approached him about securing an income stream.                 The second\n\nhappened    in   April   1994,       after   Maccabees    submitted   the   three\n\ndifferent annuity options available for a $40,000 premium. At this\n\nmeeting, Healy explained the differences between the policies and\n\nadvocated   in   favor    of    purchasing      a    lifetime   annuity   with   no\n\nguaranteed minimum (resulting in a higher monthly payment). Foisy,\n\nhowever, opted for what she and Healy understood to be the five-\n\nyear certain and continuous plan.                The third conversation took\n\nplace soon after May 16, 1994, the date the policy was issued.                   At\n\nthis point, Healy had filled out the portion of Foisy's policy\n\napplication reserved for the agent, as well as submitted the\n\nnecessary information to Maccabees to become licensed with the\n\ncompany (necessary for him to serve as the writing agent on Foisy's\n\npolicy and receive a commission). Healy's testimony indicates that\n\nthis third conversation happened when the policy was still under a\n\n30-day \"free look\" period during which Foisy had the option of\n\nreturning the contract in exchange for a refund of her premium.\n\n     At    the   time    of    the   first     two   conversations,   Healy      was\n\nundoubtedly acting in his capacity as a broker; he had no prior\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\frelationship with Maccabees and advocated solely on Foisy's behalf.\n\nIf this were all, the negligent misrepresentation claim would fail\n\nbecause the necessary agency relationship would not have existed at\n\nthe time     the   statements    were     made.     The    third   conversation,\n\nhowever, deserves closer inspection.              Healy testified that during\n\nthis conversation, he continued to advise Foisy to elect the\n\nlifetime annuity option.         Foisy, still believing she purchased a\n\ncertain and continuous life annuity, elected to hold the contract\n\nbecause she wanted a beneficiary.\n\n       The   submission   of    Healy's    licensing      information     did   not\n\nautomatically render him Maccabees' agent; at most, we believe he\n\nwas a \"special agent for a single purpose.\"                See Couch, supra, at\n\nยง 45:1.      But it does give the jury's agency finding reasonable\n\ngrounds.      By this third conversation, Healy had initiated his\n\nrelationship with Maccabees, acting at least in part on its behalf\n\nin securing Foisy's business.             During this third conversation,\n\nFoisy continued to rely - to her detriment - on Healy's assurances\n\nthat she purchased a certain and continuous lifetime annuity.\n\n       Furthermore, at the time of the third conversation, the four\n\nfactors considered by the jury yield an inference more favorable to\n\nthe verdict than was the case earlier. Although Foisy called Healy\n\ninto   the   transaction,      Healy    now   stood   to    gain   from   Foisy's\n\npurchase.     In addition to the commission - paid by Maccabees -\n\nHealy would be able to offer Maccabees' products to other clients\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\f(subject to terms controlled by the company).    And, while he may\n\nhave counseled Foisy to opt for a different Maccabees policy, he\n\ndid not steer her towards the products of another insurer.\n\n     Certainly, the jury could have determined otherwise.      The\n\nevidence reasonably would have supported a finding that Healy was\n\nFoisy's agent, preventing a finding in her favor on the negligent\n\nmisrepresentation claim.   Such a result would have been factually\n\nconsistent with the verdict on the contract claim.   But because we\n\nreverse \"only if a reasonable person could not have reached the\n\nconclusion of the jury,\" White, 221 F.3d at 259, and lacking any\n\nobjection to inconsistency by Maccabees, see Babcock v. Gen. Motors\n\nCorp., 299 F.3d 60, 63-64 (1st Cir. 2002), we do not find that\n\nMaccabees was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.         The\n\ndistrict court thus properly denied Maccabees' motion.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -19-\n\f",

Foisy received sixty months of annuity payments, but claims that under the terms of the policy, she was entitled to lifetime payments. Maccabees disagrees, contending that the policy she purchased provides only the sixty months of benefits and nothing further. Foisy filed suit in Massachusetts state court, and Maccabees removed to federal court on the basis of diversity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> A jury trial resulted in a verdict for Foisy on claims of breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation. On appeal, Maccabees challenges the timeliness of Foisy's action and the evidentiary basis for the jury verdict. We affirm the district court on all counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1994, seventy-six year old Rita Foisy consulted her son-in-law, Gerald Healy, about how she might use $40,000 received from her late husband's life insurance to secure an income stream for herself. Healy, an independent licensed insurance broker and credentialed financial consultant, agreed to research annuity products on her behalf. Healy contacted Bader Insurance Agency,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> with whom he had an established business relationship,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> for information on annuity policies. Bader, in turn, contacted Maccabees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to Bader's inquiry, Maccabees provided three \"illustrations\" of annuity policies for Foisy, each detailing a different scenario available for a $40,000 premium. Bader passed the illustrations on to Healy, who then met with Foisy to explain the various policy options. Foisy elected what both she and Healy believed to be an annuity that provided lifetime monthly payments of $710.99, including a guaranteed minimum of 60 payments totaling $42,659.40. Healy and Foisy understood that should Foisy die before the minimum 60 payments, her beneficiary received the remainder of the guaranteed sum; if Foisy died after the 60 minimum payments, the annuity would simply cease with her death and there would be no payment to the beneficiary. Healy filled out the portion of the annuity application reserved for writing agents (and in the process applied for an agent's license from Maccabees), Foisy signed the application, and the monthly payments began in May 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Foisy received exactly the benefits she expected until, in the fall of 1999, she began bouncing checks and discovered that the annuity payments that had been deposited directly into her checking account had stopped in May. When Healy contacted Maccabees on her behalf,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> the company maintained that Foisy's policy provided only 60 monthly payments, nothing thereafter, and that the provisions of the contract had thus been fulfilled.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Healy's efforts to persuade Maccabees that the policy provided lifetime benefits failed, and Foisy subsequently filed suit. She received a jury verdict in her favor on counts of breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation, and was awarded damages of $29,150.20 and $20,000, respectively. Although Maccabees pled the statute of limitations as a defense, at the close of evidence the district court determined as a matter of law that Foisy's claims were timely, and thus the jury did not consider any limitations issues. The district court denied Maccabees' post-trial motions for judgment as a matter of law or in the alternative a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maccabees appeals the district court's judgment on multiple grounds. First, the company objects to the court's decision on the statute of limitations, arguing that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law because the claims were barred or, at a minimum, the jury should have decided the limitations question. Second, with respect to the contract claim, Maccabees contests the district court's decision to allow the jury to interpret disputed language in the policy. According to Maccabees, the contract was unambiguous and should have been interpreted in its favor by the judge. The company further claims that, in any event, the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of breach. Third, Maccabees attacks the evidentiary basis for the negligent misrepresentation verdict, claiming that there is no support for the jury's finding that Healy was Maccabees' agent and that Foisy reasonably relied on Healy's statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maccabees bears a heavy burden in seeking relief from the judgment below. In reviewing a denial of judgment as a matter of law, we examine the evidence in favor of Foisy, the non-moving party. <i>Marrero v. Goya of Puerto Rico, Inc.,</i> 304 F.3d 7, 14 (1st Cir.2002). Although our review of the court's decision is plenary, our scrutiny of the jury verdict is tightly circumscribed; we will reverse only \"if a reasonable person could not have reached the conclusion of the jury.\" <i>White v. New Hampshire Dep't of Corrections,</i> 221 F.3d 254, 259 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review denial of a motion for new trial for abuse of discretion, a similarly stringent standard which recognizes that a district court should grant such a motion \"only if the verdict is against the demonstrable weight of the credible evidence or results in a blatant miscarriage of justice.\" <i>Sanchez v. Puerto Rico Oil Co.,</i> 37 F.3d 712, 717 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Statute of Limitations</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maccabees asserts that the statute of limitations began to run on both claims when Foisy purchased the policy in April 1994. According to the company, the six-year limitations period for contract claims and three-year limitations period for negligent misrepresentation claims had passed by the time Foisy filed suit in March 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Massachusetts law, which applies in this diversity case, contract claims generally accrue at breach. <i>Saenger Org. v. Nationwide Ins. Licensing Assocs.,</i> 119 F.3d 55, 64 (1st Cir.1997). Similarly, tort claims accrue at the time of injury. <i>Tagliente v. Himmer,</i> 949 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1991). Under the Massachusetts discovery rule, however, a claim will not accrue until the plaintiff \"knows of the cause of action or ... should have known of the cause of action.\" <i>Riley v. Presnell,</i> 409 Mass. 239, 244, 565 N.E.2d 780, 785 (1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are unpersuaded by Maccabees' argument that our decision in <i>Loguidice v. Metro. Life Ins. Co.,</i> 336 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2003), requires us to find that Foisy had knowledge of her claims as far back as 1994. In <i>Loguidice,</i> despite a sympathetic factual background in which an unsavory insurance agent misled the plaintiff into believing she purchased a retirement plan when in fact she purchased life insurance, we held that the claims were barred because the language of the policy clearly indicated it was life insurance, thus putting the plaintiff on inquiry notice of her claim. <i>See id.</i> at 7. Here, however, because the language in Maccabees' policy is ambiguous, <i>see infra</i> at 148, Foisy could not be expected to have had knowledge of a particular construction of the policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the same reason, Maccabees' reliance on <i>Quigley v. Unum Life Ins. Co.,</i> 688 F.Supp. 80 (D.Mass.1988), is misplaced. The <i>Quigley</i> plaintiffs' contract and negligent misrepresentation claims were barred because the contract's coverage was ascertainable had the plaintiffs performed annuity calculations. Maccabees suggests that, <i>a fortiori,</i> the relative simplicity of the six-page Maccabees policy requires a finding that Foisy should have known that she purchased a policy different from what she intended. Maccabees, however, confuses brevity with clarity. It is the policy's ambiguity &#8212; unmitigated by the relatively short length &#8212; that made Foisy's claim unknowable until 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even absent a favorable ruling on its motion for judgment as a matter of law, Maccabees contends that, at the very least, the question of accrual was for the jury to decide. <i>See Taygeta Corp. v. Varian Assoc.,</i> 436 Mass. 217, 229, 763 N.E.2d 1053, 1063 (2002) (\"In most instances, the question when a plaintiff knew or should have known of its cause of action is one of fact that will be decided by the trier of fact.\"). Having been deprived of jury consideration on a material issue, Maccabees argues it is entitled to a new trial. Acknowledging that the court's decision to rule on the issue as a matter of law was a close call, we nevertheless affirm. In light of the jury's verdict, that decision was at worst harmless error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the jury found that the contract was a life annuity &#8212; a verdict which we uphold, <i>see infra</i> at 149 &#8212; there could be no breach, and therefore no accrual of the contract claim, until after May 1999, when Maccabees stopped making monthly payments. The contract action, filed two years later, was thus timely. Although the negligent misrepresentation claim deserves slightly more attention, in the end Foisy prevails here as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Massachusetts discovery rule, the limitations period on a tort claim will not commence until a plaintiff is able to recognize some causal connection between the defendant's actions and her injury. <i>See, e.g., Szymanski v. Boston Mut. Life Ins. Co.,</i> 56 Mass.App.Ct. 367, 370-71, 778 N.E.2d 16, 20 (2002). In other words, Foisy's claim for negligent misrepresentation could not have accrued if the factual basis for it was \"inherently unknowable.\" <i>Collins v. Nuzzo,</i> 244 F.3d 246, 253 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We assume for purposes of analyzing this issue that the contract did not provide a lifetime annuity, and that Healy's statements to that effect thus were false.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Foisy argues that she could not have known that her understanding was incorrect because the contract's ambiguous language reasonably supported her interpretation. We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's threshold finding that the policy was ambiguous means that she could not be held to knowledge of her claim until 1999, when the payments stopped. We agree with the district court that no other circumstances existed to put her on notice that the company's interpretation differed substantially from her own.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the district court's denial of Maccabees' motion for judgment as a matter of law based on the statute of limitations, as well as the motion for new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Contract Claim</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maccabees contends that interpretation of the annuity policy was a question of law for the trial judge and, furthermore, that the evidence fails to support the jury verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maccabees correctly notes that construction of an insurance contract is generally a question of law. <i>See Ruggerio Ambulance Serv. v. Nat'l Grange Mut. Ins. Co.,</i> 430 Mass. 794, 797, 724 N.E.2d 295, 298 (2000). Acknowledging in passing that disputed facts bearing on interpretation may be submitted to the jury, <i>see Vergato v. Commercial Union Ins. Co.,</i> 50 Mass.App.Ct. 824, 826, 741 N.E.2d 486, 488 (2001), Maccabees continues to rely on its assertion that the contract unambiguously provides a \"certain only\" annuity, and should have been interpreted as such by the court as a matter of law. Foisy's contradictory reading of the contract is of no consequence under Maccabees' argument because a mere controversy over interpretation is not, by itself, enough to create ambiguity. <i>See Center for Blood</i> <i>Research v. Coregis Ins. Co.,</i> 305 F.3d 38, 41 (1st Cir.2002)(citing <i>County of Barnstable v. Am. Fin. Corp.,</i> 51 Mass.App.Ct. 213, 215, 744 N.E.2d 1107, 1109 (2001)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rule of interpretation, however, has more nuance than Maccabees suggests. If, upon \"application of pertinent rules of construction,\" the district court makes a threshold determination of ambiguity, and thus also finds that extrinsic evidence is necessary to resolve the dispute, then a question of fact arises to be resolved by the jury. 2 <i>Couch on Insurance</i> &#167; 21:13 (3d ed.1999); <i>see also Utica Mut. Ins. Co. v. Weathermark Investments, Inc.,</i> 292 F.3d 77, 80 (1st Cir. 2002)(\"Only where a contractual term is ambiguous does its interpretation pose a question of fact ... [and] the parties may adduce extrinsic evidence of their respective intendments.\"). A court may make such a threshold finding of ambiguity if the contractual language is \"susceptible of more than one meaning and reasonably intelligent persons [could] differ as to which meaning is the proper one.\" <i>Center for Blood Research,</i> 305 F.3d at 41.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to Maccabees' allegations, the district court undertook an appropriate preliminary analysis of the contract prior to sending it to the jury. Upon Maccabees' motion for summary judgment based on expiration of the limitations period, the court carefully considered the substance of the policy. Construing disputed provisions in the contract, the judge determined that both Maccabees and Foisy offered reasonable interpretations. As Maccabees stressed, the annuity benefits schedule listed total annuity benefits of $42,659.40 and annuity payments certain lasting 60 months. Conversely, Foisy highlighted language in the contract specifying that \"[e]xcept as stated under Death of Owner, the Annuity Payments will end with the death of the owner.\" Significantly, the court observed that the \"Death of Owner\" provision did not address the situation at hand, in which the annuitant outlived the payments certain. The controversy between Foisy and Maccabees arose from a genuine ambiguity in the contract, and the district court properly determined that the intent of the parties was therefore a question of fact suitable for trial. <i>See Seaco Ins. Co. v. Barbosa,</i> 435 Mass. 772, 779, 761 N.E.2d 946, 951 (2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maccabees also seeks to overturn the jury verdict, contending that the evidence at trial supported only the conclusion that the policy provided 60 months of payments and nothing further. Each party, however, presented expert testimony supporting a different interpretation of the policy. John Stiefel, Foisy's expert, offered his opinion that, based on a review of the document, Foisy purchased a continuous and certain annuity providing lifetime benefits. Stiefel supported his opinion with cogent and pertinent observations about the document, including use of the phrase \"life annuity\" in the title and the lack of any reference to an end date for payments. He also suggested that retired individuals like Foisy usually elect lifetime, rather than certain only, annuities because the primary motivation for purchase of the policy is to ensure that the retiree does not outlive his or her income. Buttressing the expert's opinion, Foisy and Healy each testified that they intended to apply for a policy providing a lifetime annuity. In short, there was substantial evidence on which the jury could have based its verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">None of Maccabees' contradictory evidence compelled the jurors to reject Foisy's position. Other than an annuity expert to rebut Foisy's expert, the only witness presented by Maccabees was a former marketing employee, Nancy Pietrowski, who, although well-versed in the company's usual procedure in providing illustrations to agents, had no particular recollection of the transaction with Foisy. With respect to expert opinion, Maccabees' expert testified that he interpreted the contract as a \"certain only\" annuity. But neither party's expert was impeached, and it is well within the jury's prerogative to accept the testimony of Foisy's expert over that of the company's.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we cannot precisely ascertain each individual juror's rationale for finding one expert's testimony more credible than that of another, the record reveals Maccabees' somewhat strained attempt to convince a jury to favor its proffered interpretation &#8212; pieced together through multiple cross references &#8212; over the more straightforward argument that a document which says \"life annuity\" on the cover is in fact just that. Particularly in light of the rule &#8212; recited in the jury instructions &#8212; that \"if there are two rational interpretations of policy language, the insured is entitled to the benefit of the one that is more favorable to it,\" <i>Hazen Paper Co. v. U.S. Fid. and Guar. Co.,</i> 407 Mass. 689, 700, 555 N.E.2d 576, 583 (1990), we see no cause to find fault with the jury verdict on the contract claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court properly denied Maccabees' motion for judgment as a matter of law on the contract claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">IV. <i>Negligent Misrepresentation</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maccabees' final ground of appeal is that the negligent misrepresentation claim fails because the evidence does not demonstrate that Healy was Maccabees' agent and that Foisy reasonably relied on Healy's representations about the policy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury was asked to make a threshold finding on agency by evaluating four factors: who called Healy to the transaction, who controlled his actions, who paid him, and whose interests he attempted to protect. The judge further explained that although this initial agency question was important, it was not determinative of the claim. Foisy could still prevail if she demonstrated that she relied on false statements in the annuity documents themselves. Because there is insufficient evidence in the record suggesting that Foisy relied primarily on the documents &#8212; rather than on Healy's statements &#8212; in forming her opinion of the policy's content,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> we consider the negligent misrepresentation claim only by way of Healy's alleged agency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether an individual has acted as an agent is a question of fact. <i>Pedersen v. Leahy,</i> 397 Mass. 689, 691, 493 N.E.2d 486, 487 (1986). Maccabees contends that under <i>Hudson v. Mass. Prop. Ins. Underwriting Assoc.,</i> 386 Mass. 450, 455, 436 N.E.2d 155, 158 (1982) (citations omitted), a broker \"is ordinarily the agent of the insured\" while an insurance agent usually is deemed to represent the insurer.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> <i>See also Couch, supra,</i> at &#167; 45:5 (\"Absent some special condition or circumstance in the particular case, a broker is not an agent of the insurer....\"). By Massachusetts statute, a broker \"acts or aids in any manner in negotiating policies of insurance or annuity ... for a person other than himself,\" while an agent \"solicits insurance on behalf of any company, or transmits for a person other than himself an application for ... an annuity ... to or from such company.\" Mass. Gen. L. ch. 175 &#167; 162. At the most rudimentary level, this distinction means that a broker acts as the \"middleman\" between insured and insurer, and will not be under the employ of any particular insurance company. <i>Michelson v. Franklin Fire Ins. Co. of Philadelphia,</i> 252 Mass. 336, 339, 147 N.E. 851, 852 (1925); <i>see also Couch, supra,</i> at &#167; 45:1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the statutory definitions indicate, however, the title of broker or agent will not always identify the principal. An individual may be considered a broker in the general sense, for example, but nevertheless with respect to a specific transaction be the agent of the insurer. <i>See Am. Country Ins. v. Bernhard Woodwork,</i> 412 Mass. 734, 740, 592 N.E.2d 1319, 1323 (1992) (applying Illinois law, but utilizing the same agency factors considered by the jury in the current case). When evaluating the role of an individual who assumes the characteristics of both agent and broker, we must \"look to the agent's conduct in the relevant transaction to determine the nature of the various relationships.\" <i>Id.</i> at 740, 592 N.E.2d 1319.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Healy testified to having three relevant conversations with Foisy over the course of the transaction. The first occurred when Foisy approached him about securing an income stream. The second happened in April 1994, after Maccabees submitted the three different annuity options available for a $40,000 premium. At this meeting, Healy explained the differences between the policies and advocated in favor of purchasing a lifetime annuity with no guaranteed minimum (resulting in a higher monthly payment). Foisy, however, opted for what she and Healy understood to be the five-year certain and continuous plan. The third conversation took place soon after May 16, 1994, the date the policy was issued. At this point, Healy had filled out the portion of Foisy's policy application reserved for the agent, as well as submitted the necessary information to Maccabees to become licensed with the company (necessary for him to serve as the writing agent on Foisy's policy and receive a commission). Healy's testimony indicates that this third conversation happened when the policy was still under a 30-day \"free look\" period during which Foisy had the option of returning the contract in exchange for a refund of her premium.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the first two conversations, Healy was undoubtedly acting in his capacity as a broker; he had no prior relationship with Maccabees and advocated solely on Foisy's behalf. If this were all, the negligent misrepresentation claim would fail because the necessary agency relationship would not have existed at the time the statements were made. The third conversation, however, deserves closer inspection. Healy testified that during this conversation, he continued to advise Foisy to elect the lifetime annuity option. Foisy, still believing she purchased a certain and continuous life annuity, elected to hold the contract because she wanted a beneficiary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The submission of Healy's licensing information did not automatically render him Maccabees' agent; at most, we believe he was a \"special agent for a single purpose.\" <i>See Couch, supra,</i> at &#167; 45:1. But it does give the jury's agency finding reasonable grounds. By this third conversation, Healy had initiated his relationship with Maccabees, acting at least in part on its behalf in securing Foisy's business. During this third conversation, Foisy continued to rely &#8212; to her detriment &#8212; on Healy's assurances that she purchased a certain and continuous lifetime annuity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, at the time of the third conversation, the four factors considered by the jury yield an inference more favorable to the verdict than was the case earlier. Although Foisy called Healy into the transaction, Healy now stood to gain from Foisy's purchase. In addition to the commission &#8212; paid by Maccabees &#8212; Healy would be able to offer Maccabees' products to other clients (subject to terms controlled by the company). And, while he may have counseled Foisy to opt for a different Maccabees policy, he did not steer her towards the products of another insurer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certainly, the jury could have determined otherwise. The evidence reasonably would have supported a finding that Healy was Foisy's agent, preventing a finding in her favor on the negligent misrepresentation claim. Such a result would have been factually consistent with the verdict on the contract claim. But because we reverse \"only if a reasonable person could not have reached the conclusion of the jury,\" <i>White,</i> 221 F.3d at 259, and lacking any objection to inconsistency by Maccabees, <i>see Babcock v. Gen. Motors Corp.,</i> 299 F.3d 60, 63-64 (1st Cir.2002), we do not find that Maccabees was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

If the annuitant outlives the guaranteed minimum, payments will continue for life, ending upon the death of the annuitant. A certain only annuity yields a specified number of payments and nothing beyond.

As discussed<i>infra,</i> the ambiguity here yielded two different, plausible interpretations. If that were sufficient to put a plaintiff on notice, an insurer could too easily wield ambiguity to avoid litigating the merits under the much less favorable rule that ambiguities are construed in favor of the insured. <i>See Utica Mut.

We note that, in determining that Maccabees breached the contract, the jury had to find that the policy was a certain and continuous life annuity. It would therefore seem that any statement by Healy to that effect could not be false, meaning that an essential element of the negligent misrepresentation claim was lacking. Counsel for Maccabees objected to giving any instruction at all on negligent misrepresentation, based on alleged lack of evidence, but did not object &#8212; either before the instructions were submitted to the jury or prior to the jury's discharge after rendering a verdict &#8212; on the basis of inconsistency<i>See Howard v.

Foisy received sixty months of annuity payments, but claims that under the terms of the policy, she was entitled to lifetime payments. Maccabees disagrees, contending that the policy she purchased provides only the sixty months of benefits and nothing further. Foisy filed suit in Massachusetts state court, and Maccabees removed to federal court on the basis of diversity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> A jury trial resulted in a verdict for Foisy on claims of breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation. On appeal, Maccabees challenges the timeliness of Foisy's action and the evidentiary basis for the jury verdict. We affirm the district court on all counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1994, seventy-six year old Rita Foisy consulted her son-in-law, Gerald Healy, about how she might use $40,000 received from her late husband's life insurance to secure an income stream for herself. Healy, an independent licensed insurance broker and credentialed financial consultant, agreed to research annuity products on her behalf. Healy contacted Bader Insurance Agency,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> with whom he had an established business relationship,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> for information on annuity policies. Bader, in turn, contacted Maccabees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to Bader's inquiry, Maccabees provided three \"illustrations\" of annuity policies for Foisy, each detailing a different scenario available for a $40,000 premium. Bader passed the illustrations on to Healy, who then met with Foisy to explain the various policy options. Foisy elected what both she and Healy believed to be an annuity that provided lifetime monthly payments of $710.99, including a guaranteed minimum of 60 payments totaling $42,659.40. Healy and Foisy understood that should Foisy die before the minimum 60 payments, her beneficiary received the remainder of the guaranteed sum; if Foisy died after the 60 minimum payments, the annuity would simply cease with her death and there would be no payment to the beneficiary. Healy filled out the portion of the annuity application reserved for writing agents (and in the process applied for an agent's license from Maccabees), Foisy signed the application, and the monthly payments began in May 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Foisy received exactly the benefits she expected until, in the fall of 1999, she began bouncing checks and discovered that the annuity payments that had been deposited directly into her checking account had stopped in May. When Healy contacted Maccabees on her behalf,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> the company maintained that Foisy's policy provided only 60 monthly payments, nothing thereafter, and that the provisions of the contract had thus been fulfilled.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Healy's efforts to persuade Maccabees that the policy provided lifetime benefits failed, and Foisy subsequently filed suit. She received a jury verdict in her favor on counts of breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation, and was awarded damages of $29,150.20 and $20,000, respectively. Although Maccabees pled the statute of limitations as a defense, at the close of evidence the district court determined as a matter of law that Foisy's claims were timely, and thus the jury did not consider any limitations issues. The district court denied Maccabees' post-trial motions for judgment as a matter of law or in the alternative a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maccabees appeals the district court's judgment on multiple grounds. First, the company objects to the court's decision on the statute of limitations, arguing that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law because the claims were barred or, at a minimum, the jury should have decided the limitations question. Second, with respect to the contract claim, Maccabees contests the district court's decision to allow the jury to interpret disputed language in the policy. According to Maccabees, the contract was unambiguous and should have been interpreted in its favor by the judge. The company further claims that, in any event, the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of breach. Third, Maccabees attacks the evidentiary basis for the negligent misrepresentation verdict, claiming that there is no support for the jury's finding that Healy was Maccabees' agent and that Foisy reasonably relied on Healy's statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maccabees bears a heavy burden in seeking relief from the judgment below. In reviewing a denial of judgment as a matter of law, we examine the evidence in favor of Foisy, the non-moving party. <i>Marrero v.

Maccabees suggests that, <i>a fortiori,</i> the relative simplicity of the six-page Maccabees policy requires a finding that Foisy should have known that she purchased a policy different from what she intended.

Foisy's contradictory reading of the contract is of no consequence under Maccabees' argument because a mere controversy over interpretation is not, by itself, enough to create ambiguity. <i>See Center for Blood</i> <i>Research v.

If, upon \"application of pertinent rules of construction,\" the district court makes a threshold determination of ambiguity, and thus also finds that extrinsic evidence is necessary to resolve the dispute, then a question of fact arises to be resolved by the jury. 2 <i>Couch on Insurance</i> &#167; 21:13 (3d ed.1999); <i>see also Utica Mut.

Upon Maccabees' motion for summary judgment based on expiration of the limitations period, the court carefully considered the substance of the policy. Construing disputed provisions in the contract, the judge determined that both Maccabees and Foisy offered reasonable interpretations. As Maccabees stressed, the annuity benefits schedule listed total annuity benefits of $42,659.40 and annuity payments certain lasting 60 months. Conversely, Foisy highlighted language in the contract specifying that \"[e]xcept as stated under Death of Owner, the Annuity Payments will end with the death of the owner.\" Significantly, the court observed that the \"Death of Owner\" provision did not address the situation at hand, in which the annuitant outlived the payments certain. The controversy between Foisy and Maccabees arose from a genuine ambiguity in the contract, and the district court properly determined that the intent of the parties was therefore a question of fact suitable for trial. <i>See Seaco Ins. Co. v. Barbosa,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">772</span></span>, 779, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">761</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">946</span></span>, 951 (2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maccabees also seeks to overturn the jury verdict, contending that the evidence at trial supported only the conclusion that the policy provided 60 months of payments and nothing further. Each party, however, presented expert testimony supporting a different interpretation of the policy. John Stiefel, Foisy's expert, offered his opinion that, based on a review of the document, Foisy purchased a continuous and certain annuity providing lifetime benefits. Stiefel supported his opinion with cogent and pertinent observations about the document, including use of the phrase \"life annuity\" in the title and the lack of any reference to an end date for payments. He also suggested that retired individuals like Foisy usually elect lifetime, rather than certain only, annuities because the primary motivation for purchase of the policy is to ensure that the retiree does not outlive his or her income. Buttressing the expert's opinion, Foisy and Healy each testified that they intended to apply for a policy providing a lifetime annuity. In short, there was substantial evidence on which the jury could have based its verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">None of Maccabees' contradictory evidence compelled the jurors to reject Foisy's position. Other than an annuity expert to rebut Foisy's expert, the only witness presented by Maccabees was a former marketing employee, Nancy Pietrowski, who, although well-versed in the company's usual procedure in providing illustrations to agents, had no particular recollection of the transaction with Foisy. With respect to expert opinion, Maccabees' expert testified that he interpreted the contract as a \"certain only\" annuity. But neither party's expert was impeached, and it is well within the jury's prerogative to accept the testimony of Foisy's expert over that of the company's.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we cannot precisely ascertain each individual juror's rationale for finding one expert's testimony more credible than that of another, the record reveals Maccabees' somewhat strained attempt to convince a jury to favor its proffered interpretation &#8212; pieced together through multiple cross references &#8212; over the more straightforward argument that a document which says \"life annuity\" on the cover is in fact just that.

Foisy could still prevail if she demonstrated that she relied on false statements in the annuity documents themselves.

The first occurred when Foisy approached him about securing an income stream. The second happened in April 1994, after Maccabees submitted the three different annuity options available for a $40,000 premium. At this meeting, Healy explained the differences between the policies and advocated in favor of purchasing a lifetime annuity with no guaranteed minimum (resulting in a higher monthly payment). Foisy, however, opted for what she and Healy understood to be the five-year certain and continuous plan. The third conversation took place soon after May 16, 1994, the date the policy was issued. At this point, Healy had filled out the portion of Foisy's policy application reserved for the agent, as well as submitted the necessary information to Maccabees to become licensed with the company (necessary for him to serve as the writing agent on Foisy's policy and receive a commission). Healy's testimony indicates that this third conversation happened when the policy was still under a 30-day \"free look\" period during which Foisy had the option of returning the contract in exchange for a refund of her premium.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the first two conversations, Healy was undoubtedly acting in his capacity as a broker; he had no prior relationship with Maccabees and advocated solely on Foisy's behalf. If this were all, the negligent misrepresentation claim would fail because the necessary agency relationship would not have existed at the time the statements were made. The third conversation, however, deserves closer inspection. Healy testified that during this conversation, he continued to advise Foisy to elect the lifetime annuity option. Foisy, still believing she purchased a certain and continuous life annuity, elected to hold the contract because she wanted a beneficiary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The submission of Healy's licensing information did not automatically render him Maccabees' agent; at most, we believe he was a \"special agent for a single purpose.\" <i>See Couch, supra,</i> at &#167; 45:1. But it does give the jury's agency finding reasonable grounds. By this third conversation, Healy had initiated his relationship with Maccabees, acting at least in part on its behalf in securing Foisy's business. During this third conversation, Foisy continued to rely &#8212; to her detriment &#8212; on Healy's assurances that she purchased a certain and continuous lifetime annuity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, at the time of the third conversation, the four factors considered by the jury yield an inference more favorable to the verdict than was the case earlier. Although Foisy called Healy into the transaction, Healy now stood to gain from Foisy's purchase. In addition to the commission &#8212; paid by Maccabees &#8212; Healy would be able to offer Maccabees' products to other clients (subject to terms controlled by the company). And, while he may have counseled Foisy to opt for a different Maccabees policy, he did not steer her towards the products of another insurer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certainly, the jury could have determined otherwise. The evidence reasonably would have supported a finding that Healy was Foisy's agent, preventing a finding in her favor on the negligent misrepresentation claim. Such a result would have been factually consistent with the verdict on the contract claim. But because we reverse \"only if a reasonable person could not have reached the conclusion of the jury,\" <i>White,</i> 221 F.3d at 259, and lacking any objection to inconsistency by Maccabees, <i>see Babcock v.

A certain and continuous annuity provides a minimum number of guaranteed payments, regardless of whether the annuitant dies before the minimum payments are complete. If the annuitant outlives the guaranteed minimum, payments will continue for life, ending upon the death of the annuitant. A certain only annuity yields a specified number of payments and nothing beyond. A third option, only tangentially relevant here, is the lifetime annuity, in which the annuitant receives payments for life, with no guaranteed minimum</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The jury's verdict in favor of Foisy on both claims rests on the contradictory factual predicate that the contract was &#8212; for purposes of the contract claim &#8212; a certain and continuous policy, but that &#8212; for purposes of the negligent misrepresentation claim &#8212; it was a certain only policy. We see no grounds, however, for disturbing the verdict on the basis of that inconsistency<i>See infra</i> at 149 n. 8.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Contrary to Maccabees' contention at oral argument, the ambiguity itself did not put Foisy on notice. As discussed<i>infra,</i> the ambiguity here yielded two different, plausible interpretations. If that were sufficient to put a plaintiff on notice, an insurer could too easily wield ambiguity to avoid litigating the merits under the much less favorable rule that ambiguities are construed in favor of the insured. <i>See Utica Mut.

We do not decide under what circumstances a patent or flagrant ambiguity would put a plaintiff on notice.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The foundation for the negligent misrepresentation claim is that Maccabees, through Healy, represented that the policy provided lifetime benefits when, in fact, it did not. We note that, in determining that Maccabees breached the contract, the jury had to find that the policy was a certain and continuous life annuity. It would therefore seem that any statement by Healy to that effect could not be false, meaning that an essential element of the negligent misrepresentation claim was lacking. Counsel for Maccabees objected to giving any instruction at all on negligent misrepresentation, based on alleged lack of evidence, but did not object &#8212; either before the instructions were submitted to the jury or prior to the jury's discharge after rendering a verdict &#8212; on the basis of inconsistency<i>See Howard v. Antilla,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200054\"><a href=\"/opinion/200054/howard-v-antilla/\"><span class=\"volume\">294</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">244</span></a></span>, 247 n. 6, 250 (1st Cir.2002)(barring objection to inconsistent verdict when not raised before discharge of the jury and noting further that appellant failed to object to use of the jury form permitting such inconsistency). We thus proceed with discussion of the negligent misrepresentation claim as if it did not conflict with the jury's finding on the contract claim.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> The only testimony on whether Foisy read the policy was her own somewhat equivocal statement, \"Well, I don't know &#8212; there's so much on those policies, you don't read all the fine print.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> The industry distinction between \"broker\" and \"agent\" has the potential to engender confusion with the legal principle of agency. With respect to representative capacity, both a broker and an agent may be vested with agency authority; the question is whether the insured or the insurer is the principal</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
