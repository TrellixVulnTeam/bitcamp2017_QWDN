José Antonio Fusté, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                         Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n                Lynch and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\f     Eduardo A. Vera Ramírez, with whom Roberto Sanchez Ramos,\nSecretary of Justice, Salvador Antonetti Stutts, Solicitor\nGeneral, Eileen Landrón Guardiola, Courtney R. Carroll and\nLandrón & Vera, LLP, were on brief, for appellants.\n     Marie Elsie Lopez Adames, with whom Gonzalez Lopez & Lopez\nAdames was on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n\n                          July 13, 2006\n\f              Per Curiam.     This is an interlocutory appeal of the\n\ndenial of a motion for summary judgment brought by two defendants\n\nto a political discrimination lawsuit.            One of the appellants is\n\nAníbal Acevedo Vilá, the Governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto\n\nRico.     Acevedo Vilá is a substitute defendant to an official\n\ncapacity claim for prospective injunctive relief initially lodged\n\nagainst his predecessor, Sila María Calderón.              See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n25(d).        (Confusingly, plaintiffs-appellees argue as if former\n\nGovernor Calderón remains a defendant, but she has not been a party\n\nto this action for quite some time).                The other appellant is\n\nMilton   Segarra,    the    Executive   Director    of    the   Commonwealth's\n\nTourism Company, who has been sued in his individual capacity.\n\nThree former employees of the Tourism Company brought the action,\n\nwhich seeks damages from Segarra and the equitable remedy of\n\nreinstatement under federal and Commonwealth law.\n\n              The motion for summary judgment was based, in relevant\n\npart,    on    immunity    defenses,    Acevedo    Vilá    claiming   Eleventh\n\nAmendment      immunity,    and   Segarra    invoking     the   application   of\n\nqualified immunity. The district court disagreed, holding that the\n\nclaims against the Governor were permissible under Ex parte Young,\n\n209 U.S. 123, 155-56 (1908), and that genuine issues of material\n\nfact as to motive precluded summary judgment on the basis that the\n\nExecutive Director was entitled to qualified immunity.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\f             We start with the Governor's arguments.           Acevedo Vilá\n\nsays that the district court erred in two respects.               First, the\n\ncourt overlooked the fact that plaintiffs do seek damages from him\n\nin his official capacity.         Second, the court failed to appreciate\n\nthat the pleadings and evidence are insufficient to establish the\n\nGovernor's authority to order plaintiffs' reinstatement. In making\n\nthe    latter   argument,   the    Governor   invokes   Ex    parte    Young's\n\nadmonition that the case not be too broadly applied.            See 209 U.S.\n\nat 157 (\"In making an officer of the state a party defendant in a\n\nsuit    to   enjoin   the   enforcement     of   an   act    alleged   to   be\n\nunconstitutional, it is plain that such officer must have some\n\nconnection with the enforcement of the act, or else it is merely\n\nmaking him a party as a representative of the state, and thereby\n\nattempting to make the state a party.\").\n\n             We reject the Governor's argument pertaining to monetary\n\nrelief.      Our review of the record simply does not substantiate\n\nAcevedo Vilá's assertion that plaintiffs are seeking monetary\n\ndamages from him.     Of course, were it otherwise, plaintiffs' claim\n\nfor monetary relief would be barred by the Eleventh Amendment.\n\nSee, e.g., Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89,\n\n102-03 (1984). But the district court fully appreciated this. See\n\nCosta Ureña v. Segarra, Civil No. 02-2745 (JAF), slip op. at 3\n\n(D.P.R. June 16, 2005).       If the desire is to have the judgment\n\nmodified to more explicitly state that the Governor is immune from\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fmonetary liability in his official capacity, such a request should\n\nbe directed to the trial court.\n\n              We also reject the Governor's request that he be relieved\n\nof     the    burden    of     defending    against    plaintiffs'        claim    for\n\nreinstatement.         Initially, we doubt that we have jurisdiction to\n\nentertain the Governor's argument.               Our jurisdiction under the\n\ncollateral order doctrine encompasses only interlocutory appeals\n\nfrom denials of motions to dismiss based on the Eleventh Amendment,\n\nsee P.R. Aqueduct & Sewer Auth. v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U.S.\n\n139,    141    (1993),    and    \"inextricably      intertwined\"     matters,      see\n\nNieves-Márquez v. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 353 F.3d 108, 123-24\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).             Although the Governor purports to base his\n\nexemption from suit on the Eleventh Amendment, it is difficult to\n\nsee how the sovereignty interests the Amendment seeks to protect\n\nare implicated here.            Clearly, some Commonwealth official could\n\nproperly be ordered to reinstate plaintiffs, so this is not a\n\nsituation where we are being asked, in substance, \"to prevent the\n\nindignity of subjecting a State to the coercive process of judicial\n\ntribunals at the instance of private parties.\"                 In re Ayers, 123\n\nU.S. 443, 505 (1887).             The official capacity claim against the\n\nGovernor seeks nothing other than prospective injunctive relief,\n\nand the Eleventh Amendment is \"wholly inapplicable\" to such claims.\n\nMetcalf & Eddy, 506 U.S. at 146; cf. Swint v. Chambers County\n\nComm'n,      514   U.S.   35    (1995)   (refusal     to   dismiss   on    basis   of\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\fqualified immunity not immediately appealable as a collateral order\n\ninsofar as refusal was based on an assertion that defendant was not\n\nthe proper defendant).   In any event, even if we concluded that the\n\nGovernor's argument properly was based on the Eleventh Amendment,\n\nwe would reject his request for relief on the merits.   Cf. Parella\n\nv. Ret. Bd. of the R.I. Employees Retirement Sys., 173 F.3d 46,\n\n53-57 (1st Cir. 1999) (courts may bypass jurisdictional inquiries\n\ninvolving the denial of an Eleventh Amendment defense where the\n\nmerits of the underlying issue are easily resolved).    An Eleventh\n\nAmendment defense is waivable, and the proponent bears the burden\n\nof proof.   See Verlinden B.V. v. Cent. Bank of Nigeria, 461 U.S.\n\n480, 494 n.20 (1983); Guzman-Rivera v. Rivera-Cruz, 98 F.3d 664,\n\n667 (1st Cir. 1996).     Here, the Governor attempts to carry his\n\nburden by means of a one-sentence argument: that his undisputed\n\npower to make appointments under Puerto Rico law and to appoint the\n\nExecutive Director of the Tourism Company are \"legally insufficient\n\nbas[e]s to connect the Governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\n\nto the injunctive relief requested.\"    Why this is so is entirely\n\nunelaborated and far from self-evident.    We are at the very least\n\ndubious that an order from the Governor to the Executive Director\n\nof the Tourism Company that plaintiffs be reinstated would go\n\nunheeded.   But in any event, we are not inclined to address the\n\nmerits of what may be a complicated issue of Commonwealth law\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fwithout assistance from the party bringing the appeal.                    See United\n\nStates v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n              Finally,    the    Executive      Director's   appeal       fails   on\n\njurisdictional     grounds.        The   appeal     does   not    argue    that   the\n\ndistrict court misapplied clearly established federal law to the\n\nfacts as those facts must be taken at the summary judgment stage.\n\nRather, the appeal, which challenges the adequacy of the evidence\n\nthat   the    Executive    Director      harbored    a   discriminatory      animus\n\nagainst plaintiffs and members of plaintiffs' political party,\n\nargues only that the court misread the evidence in arriving at the\n\ncorpus   of    facts     under   which    the    legality    of    the    Executive\n\nDirector's conduct must be assessed.                Such an argument may not,\n\nunder the collateral order doctrine, ground an interlocutory appeal\n\nfrom the denial of a motion to dismiss on qualified immunity\n\ngrounds.      See, e.g., Johnson v. Jones, 515 U.S. 304, 311 (1995);\n\nRiverdale Mills Corp. v. Pimpare, 392 F.3d 55, 60 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n              Affirmed in part; dismissed in part.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\f",

Here, the Governor attempts to carry his\n\nburden by means of a one-sentence argument: that his undisputed\n\npower to make appointments under Puerto Rico law and to appoint the\n\nExecutive Director of the Tourism Company are \"legally insufficient\n\nbas[e]s to connect the Governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\n\nto the injunctive relief requested.\"    Why this is so is entirely\n\nunelaborated and far from self-evident.    We are at the very least\n\ndubious that an order from the Governor to the Executive Director\n\nof the Tourism Company that plaintiffs be reinstated would go\n\nunheeded.   But in any event, we are not inclined to address the\n\nmerits of what may be a complicated issue of Commonwealth law\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fwithout assistance from the party bringing the appeal.                    See United\n\nStates v. Zannino, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n              Finally,    the    Executive      Director's   appeal       fails   on\n\njurisdictional     grounds.        The   appeal     does   not    argue    that   the\n\ndistrict court misapplied clearly established federal law to the\n\nfacts as those facts must be taken at the summary judgment stage.\n\nRather, the appeal, which challenges the adequacy of the evidence\n\nthat   the    Executive    Director      harbored    a   discriminatory      animus\n\nagainst plaintiffs and members of plaintiffs' political party,\n\nargues only that the court misread the evidence in arriving at the\n\ncorpus   of    facts     under   which    the    legality    of    the    Executive\n\nDirector's conduct must be assessed.                Such an argument may not,\n\nunder the collateral order doctrine, ground an interlocutory appeal\n\nfrom the denial of a motion to dismiss on qualified immunity\n\ngrounds.      See, e.g., Johnson v. Jones, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117950\"><a href=\"/opinion/117950/johnson-v-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">304</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 311 (1995);\n\nRiverdale Mills Corp. v.
