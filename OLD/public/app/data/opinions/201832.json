Valldejuli for appellee.\n\n\n\n                       September 20, 2005\n\f            BOUDIN,    Chief     Judge.        In    the      district    court,     the\n\nplaintiff    Bernabé    Tejada    Batista      (“Tejada”)         recovered     damages\n\nagainst two of his superiors in the Puerto Rico Justice Department\n\n(“PRJD”) for instigating Tejada’s discharge in violation of his\n\nFirst   Amendment      rights.        The   underlying          events    are   easily\n\ndescribed; the complications arise out of governing legal doctrine.\n\n            In 1987, Tejada began working as a law enforcement agent\n\nin the Special Investigations Bureau (“the bureau”) of the PRJD.\n\nAfter other stints, Tejada was assigned in 1995 to the bureau’s\n\norganized     crime     division,       where       he        operated    undercover,\n\ninfiltrating    Dominican      drug     trafficking        rings.        According   to\n\nTejada’s    later   testimony,     he    came   to       be    troubled    by   certain\n\n\"irregularities”: drug busts called off on the eve of arrest,\n\nwithout explanation; misuse of funds by another agent; and shady\n\ndealings by a government informant named Ivan Merced.\n\n            Tejada reported these concerns to Antonio Franco (his\n\nsupervisor) and to the two higher officials later held liable to\n\nTejada in this case: Domingo Alvarez (division head) and Lydia\n\nMorales (bureau director).         No action was taken in response to his\n\ncomplaints.    Worse still, a trafficker named Hernandez told Tejada\n\nthat Merced had disclosed to gang members Tejada’s identity as an\n\nundercover    officer.      When      Tejada    so       advised    Franco,      Franco\n\nthreatened to discipline Tejada for speaking to Hernandez without\n\nauthorization.\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f            Thereafter, a hit man whom Tejada had helped put in\n\nprison was released and, Tejada believed, began to search for\n\nTejada.    Fearing for his family’s safety and his own, Tejada asked\n\nFranco for a transfer out of his division.      Tejada then wrote to\n\nMorales, setting forth his complaints about Merced, the threat the\n\nlatter posed to investigations, and the threat posed by the hit\n\nman.\n\n            Morales responded by transferring Tejada into what Tejada\n\ndescribed as a dead-end job at bureau headquarters, one that often\n\nleft him without any work to do.       After receiving a number of\n\nthreatening phone calls at his home, Tejada contacted Franco and\n\nAlvarez, who did not respond to his concerns.    In May 1996, Tejada\n\nwas activated for National Guard duty; Morales accused him of\n\nabusing military leave and withheld his pay.         Eventually, in\n\nJanuary 1997, Tejada moved his family to Florida at his own\n\nexpense.\n\n            In December 1996, Tejada, while still on leave, spoke\n\nwith a reporter for the El Vocero newspaper; on December 10, a\n\nshort article appeared, entitled \"S.I.B. Director and Assistant\n\nDenied Agent Transfer Although His Life Was in Danger.\"     The next\n\nday, another appeared with the title, \"Domingo Alvarez of the\n\nS.I.B. Forbids Arrest in Drug Transactions.\"    The articles touched\n\non the problems Tejada had complained of internally; each cited\n\nTejada as a source.\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f            The first short article, in substance, reported that\n\nMorales and Alvarez failed to protect Tejada despite threats on his\n\nlife; that when he was transferred, it was only to an \"inoperative\n\nsection\";   that     Alvarez   quashed         another    agent's   complaint       by\n\nthreatening a transfer like Tejada's; and that Tejada had no\n\nregular   car   to   use   while    at    his    new     job,   since    the    bureau\n\nprohibited agents from using their private cars and claimed that\n\nthere were insufficient cars available.\n\n            The second article alleged that Alvarez once suddenly and\n\nwithout explanation cancelled an imminent drug bust.                    It also said\n\nthat a certain \"Ivan Rodriguez\"--a disguised name for the informant\n\nIvan   Merced--had     blown       Tejada's      cover,     \"ruined\"      expensive\n\ninvestigations,      was   \"negotiating          drug    transactions\"         without\n\nauthorization from the bureau, and \"was working for the Bureau and\n\nfor the underworld.\"        It described one investigation involving\n\nMerced as follows (in translation):\n\n            [Tejada] alleges that the confidant ruined an\n            investigation in which a 50 kilos (which is\n            valued at about $250,000) transaction was\n            going to be made and \"which was going great\n            and overnight it was ruined.\"\n\n            On the day the second article appeared, Alvarez sent\n\nMorales a memorandum recommending Tejada's discharge on the basis\n\nof his leaks, saying that they endangered both an investigation\n\nthat was \"still open\" and the life of the informant.                The next day,\n\nAlvarez wrote another memorandum to Morales, again recommending\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fdischarge--this time prompted (supposedly) by an anonymous tip\n\nsaying that Tejada had, in 1993, been convicted of domestic abuse.\n\nWhether Alvarez had earlier known of the conviction was disputed.\n\n          The 1993 conviction, which occurred while Tejada was on\n\nmilitary leave, resulted from Tejada’s hitting his wife, but it had\n\nbeen formally expunged by court order when Tejada completed a\n\nrehabilitation or \"diversion\" program.    Alvarez's memorandum to\n\nMorales mentions the diversion program, but not that its completion\n\nentailed erasure of Tejada's conviction (even though he later\n\ntestified that he knew diversion entailed expungement).\n\n          Morales, who was stepping down as bureau director, passed\n\nboth of Alvarez's memoranda--one about the leaks, the other about\n\nthe past conviction--to the incoming acting director (Morales’s own\n\nformer deputy), Miguel Gierbolini. On February 4, 1997, Gierbolini\n\nrecommended to the newly appointed Secretary of Justice, José\n\nFuentes Agostini, that Tejada be discharged for the 1993 domestic\n\nviolence conviction on the ground that someone with this record\n\nshould not be a police agent.\n\n          Fuentes signed Tejada's termination papers on February\n\n27, 1997; Tejada, still on military leave, learned of this in early\n\nMarch, and an informal agency hearing was held on November 17,\n\n1997.   The hearing officer recommended discharge because the\n\nconduct leading to Tejada’s conviction represented, in violation of\n\nthe bureau's regulations, \"improper behavior or [behavior] damaging\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fto the good name of the agency or the Government of Puerto Rico\"\n\nand \"commission of acts for which is charged or may be charged a\n\nfelony or misdemeanor crime.\"\n\n          Tejada brought suit in federal district court, seeking\n\ndamages and injunctive relief under section 1983, 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n\n(2000), for violation of his First Amendment rights.        Named as\n\ndefendants were Fuentes, Morales, Alvarez, Gierbolini, Franco, two\n\nother supervisors named Cristobal Irrizary and Ernesto Fernández,\n\nand an unnamed PRJD employee. Defense motions for summary judgment\n\nbased on qualified immunity were denied, but the court eventually\n\ndismissed the claims against Fuentes, Fernández, and Irrizary for\n\nlack of evidence to support liability.\n\n          In dismissing the claim against Fuentes, the judge said\n\nthat the evidence was insufficient as to motive, as it \"point[ed]\n\nto\" a \"very valid, nondiscriminatory reason.\"   He later explained\n\nin a written opinion:\n\n          Nothing    in    the    plaintiff's    evidence\n          established     that     [Secretary]    Fuentes\n          Agostini's    motivation    for   signing   the\n          termination letter was in any way related to\n          the publication of the newspaper articles or\n          plaintiff's denouncement of corruption.\n\nInstead, the evidence showed that Fuentes had merely \"signed the\n\ntermination letter adopting a recommendation\" based on Tejada’s\n\nprior conviction.\n\n          As to the remaining defendants, the judge wrote that\n\n\"[t]here is sufficient evidence . . . from which a reasonable trier\n\n                                -7-\n\fof fact could find in favor of plaintiff.\"       He noted Tejada's\n\ninternal complaints of corruption, appellants’ inaction, the timing\n\nof Alvarez's memoranda, the possibility that Alvarez had long known\n\nof the conviction, and Morales' role in forwarding the memoranda to\n\nGierbolini.   In other words, the judge thought that their motive\n\ncould be deemed retaliatory.\n\n          On February 27, 2003, after a four-day trial, the jury\n\nreturned a verdict against Morales and Alvarez, assessing damages\n\nof $125,000 for Tejada's lost income.    The district court denied\n\npost-trial motions for judgment in favor of the defendants, a new\n\ntrial, and remittitur.   Morales and Alvarez now appeal, contesting\n\nboth the verdict against them and the amount of damages.\n\n          The appeal implicates several different bodies of court-\n\ncreated law, beginning with the cause of action itself.    Although\n\nthe section 1983 cause of action is statutory, the substance of the\n\nclaim here derives from Supreme Court precedents construing the\n\nFirst Amendment.   In a nutshell, the Pickering/Connick line of\n\ndecisions forbids officials from firing an employee for “protected\n\nspeech” unless under a balancing test the governmental interests\n\noutweigh the need for protection.1\n\n\n     1\n      See Pickering v. Bd. of Educ. of Township High Sch. Dist.\n205, 391 U.S. 563, 564, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 1732-33, 20 L.Ed.2d 811\n(1968); Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S.\n274, 281-82, 97 S.Ct. 568, 573-74, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977); Givhan v.\nWestern Line Consol. Sch. Dist., 439 U.S. 410, 411-13, 99 S.Ct.\n693, 694-95, 58 L.Ed.2d 619 (1979); Connick v. Myers, 461 U.S. 138,\n140-41, 103 S.Ct. 1684, 1686-87, 75 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983); Board of\n\n                                -8-\n\f              The claim thus turns in the first instance on the nature\n\nof the speech, the balancing of interests, and the motivation for\n\nthe firing.     In this instance, the defendants concede for purposes\n\nof this appeal that Tejada’s “speech”–-his disclosures to the\n\nreporter–-was at least in part protected speech under the governing\n\ncase law.       The disclosures, indeed, involved alleged serious\n\nmismanagement and possible corruption in the bureau, see Guilloty\n\nPerez v. Pierluisi, 339 F.3d 43, 52-53 (1st Cir. 2003), and they\n\noccurred only after Tejada had properly sought relief through\n\ninternal complaints, cf. Wagner v. City of Holyoke, 404 F.3d 504,\n\n508 (1st Cir. 2005) (per curiam).\n\n              The “balancing”--ordinarily a question of law for the\n\ncourt--is a much closer question. The defendants argue that Tejada\n\npotentially endangered the life of an informant (Ivan) and could\n\nhave jeopardized ongoing investigations.             This solicitude may\n\nappear   to    contrast   with   defendants’   own   limited   interest   in\n\nTejada’s safety. Furthermore, only Ivan's first name was revealed,\n\nand Ivan was himself in jail (for unauthorized drug dealing while\n\nacting as an informant) by the time of the newspaper reports.\n\n              Nevertheless, had Tejada been fired because he revealed\n\ninformation jeopardizing an informant and an ongoing investigation,\n\ndefendants would have an excellent argument that Tejada was fired\n\n\n\nCounty Comm'rs, Wabaunsee County, Kan. v. Umbehr, 518 U.S. 668,\n670, 116 S.Ct. 2342, 2345, 135 L.Ed.2d 843 (1996).\n\n                                     -9-\n\ffor unprotected speech. See United States v. Chagra, 701 F.2d 354,\n\n365 (5th Cir. 1983).   However, so far as Morales and Alvarez were\n\nresponsible for the firing–-a separate question to which we will\n\nreturn–-the jury could on the evidence before it conclude that\n\ntheir motives were not based on these concerns about Ivan and the\n\ninvestigation, but that they acted because of Tejada’s protected\n\nspeech.\n\n          Tejada’s   main   disclosures   were   of   mismanagement   and\n\npossible corruption; hostility to him had been demonstrated because\n\nof his internal complaints well before his newspaper disclosures;\n\nand the addition of the domestic violence charge could have been\n\nviewed as a gratuitous gesture undermining the claim by appellants\n\nthat they were centrally concerned with the threat to Ivan or\n\nongoing investigations.     In short, the jury could have concluded\n\nthat the appellants acted because of Tejada's protected speech.\n\n          The focus of the appellants’ brief, so far as liability\n\nis concerned, is on a multi-step claim: that Fuentes, not the\n\nappellants, fired Tejada; that Fuentes did so on an entirely\n\ndifferent ground unconnected with protected speech; and that these\n\ncircumstances insulate the appellants from liability under the so-\n\ncalled Mt. Healthy defense, which arises where the firing would\n\nhave occurred even without the protected speech.        See Mt. Healthy\n\nCity Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 287 (1977).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\f            To start with the factual premises, we agree that Fuentes\n\npurported to discharge Tejada because of the domestic violence\n\nconviction, and for the present appeal we accept that this was\n\nindeed Fuentes’s ground.        This is not because the district court's\n\nruling to this effect binds us, as appellants assert, but because\n\nthere is no direct evidence that Fuentes acted on any other\n\nground.2    A circumstantial case to the contrary might be attempted\n\n(based on implausibility), but it would not be easy and Tejada does\n\nnot attempt such an attack on appeal.\n\n            Strictly speaking, Mt. Healthy is not on point here.                    It\n\ndeals with actions taken by an official or agency out of “mixed\n\nmotives.”      It     says,    in   substance,    that       where   there    was   a\n\npermissible     and     impermissible         ground     for    a    firing,    the\n\nimpermissible ground should be ignored where the employee would\n\nhave been discharged anyway based on the permissible motive.\n\nAlthough    clear     policy    considerations         are   invoked,   the    main\n\nrationale is that in such a case the impermissible ground was not\n\na but-for cause of the firing; it would have happened anyway.                   429\n\nU.S. at 285-87.\n\n\n     2\n      Although appellants say that the dismissal of Fuentes created\n“law of the case” that settles the question on appeal, this\nreflects a basic misunderstanding of the doctrine. The branch of\nthe doctrine invoked here is simply a prudential (but not\nobligatory) rule that the same court will ordinarily not revisit an\nearlier ruling made in the same case. See Conley v. United States,\n323 F.3d 7, 12 (1st Cir. 2003) (en banc). The doctrine does not\ndetermine whether the district court's ruling as to Fuentes is\ncorrect nor bar a challenge to it on this appeal.\n\n                                       -11-\n\f           Thus, Mt. Healthy comports with the traditional tort-law\n\nprinciple that if the wrongful act did not cause the injury, the\n\nwrongdoer is not liable.        See Prosser & Keeton on Torts, § 41 at\n\n263 (5th ed. 1984).    By contrast, in this case, the actions of the\n\nappellants were a “but-for” cause of Tejada’s firing.              The jury\n\ncould easily have concluded that Tejada would not have been fired\n\nif appellants had not disclosed Tejada’s prior conviction and\n\npassed along the recommendation to Fuentes.                 The appellants'\n\nactions were also surely a “proximate cause” as well, in the sense\n\nthat the result was foreseeable (indeed, desired).\n\n           So the problem in this case is not one of a single actor\n\nwith multiple motives, but of sequential actors having different\n\nmotives–-the first actor's motive being unlawful and the second\n\nactor's motive at least permissible.         In such a case, the first\n\nactor may be (and here was) a but-for cause of the firing.                The\n\nquestion is whether the intervening step-–a final decision maker\n\nacting on a permissible ground-–should as a matter of policy (not\n\nlack of causation) insulate the wrongdoer from liability.\n\n           We have found only a few circuits that have addressed\n\nthis sequence-of-actors issue in the present context, and they are\n\nnominally in conflict.      The Fifth Circuit says that the final\n\naction by the properly motived superior insulates the ill-motivated\n\nsubordinate, Beattie v. Madison County Sch. Dist., 254 F.3d 595,\n\n603-05   (5th   Cir.   2001);    three   other   circuits    say   that   the\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fsubordinate remains liable if he is a but-for cause of the firing,\n\nGilbrook v. City of Westminster, 177 F.3d 839, 854-56 (9th Cir.\n\n1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1061 (1999); Saye v. St. Vrain Valley\n\nSch. Dist., 785 F.2d 862, 867 (10th Cir. 1986); Hickman v. Valley\n\nLocal Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ., 619 F.2d 606, 610 (6th Cir. 1980).\n\nWhether any of these cases intends a wholly mechanical rule in all\n\ncases is open to doubt.\n\n            Our own recent decision in Webber v. Int'l Paper Co., 417\n\nF.3d 229 (1st Cir. 2005), far from assisting appellants, appears to\n\nassume arguendo that a tainted adverse recommendation from a\n\nsupervisor    to    a   superior   might    create   liability    even   if   the\n\nsuperior's own motive was pure.             Ultimately, the court did not\n\ndecide the issue; it found that (unlike the present case) the\n\nsuperior had determined to terminate the employee on legitimate\n\ngrounds    before    any   contact   with    the   supervisor    and   that   the\n\nsupervisor had no causal influence on the firing.\n\n            In any case, a rigid rule would not comport with sound\n\npolicy.3   Suppose that the appellants had disclosed that Tejada was\n\ntaking payoffs from the mob and Fuentes had discharged Tejada on\n\nthat basis; it is hard to imagine any court upholding damages to\n\n\n\n     3\n      Section 1983, as we have already noted, provides only a\nskeletal civil remedy for violations of federal law. Much of the\nremedial law under section 1983 is court made, see Chemerinsky,\nFederal Jurisdiction § 8.11, at 578-85 (4th ed. 2003), and the kind\nof interstitial problem presented here is especially suited for\ndevelopment through case law.\n\n                                     -13-\n\fTejada for the firing, even if appellants' motives were unlawful.\n\nConversely,      suppose   in    retaliation       for       protected    speech   the\n\nappellants misled Fuentes into thinking that Tejada had shirked his\n\nduties; surely they should be held liable even if Fuentes’s own\n\nmotives were innocent.\n\n              Our case falls between such extremes.                 Even accepting\n\nthat Fuentes' own motive was \"pure,\" a jury could reasonably doubt\n\nthat the firing would have occurred if Fuentes had stumbled across\n\nthe prior conviction on his own.             Appellants cite authority under\n\nPuerto Rico law for discharging a police officer for domestic\n\nabuse.      But here Tejada’s conviction was over three years old, and\n\nthe conviction had been expunged under local law after he had\n\nreceived     counseling.        It   is   highly   unlikely       that    absent   the\n\nappellants’ prompting, the firing was inevitable.\n\n              Nor was Tejada’s misconduct of such a kind that would\n\nmake   it    unthinkable   to    retain     him    as    a    policeman    after   its\n\ndisclosure, as would be the case if he was guilty of mob ties or\n\nmurder.      His misconduct was serious, to be sure; but it was one\n\nincident, well in the past, and Tejada had been rehabilitated.\n\nThis is not a case in which it offends public policy to sanction a\n\ndefendant who, for improper reasons, revealed Tejada's earlier\n\noffense in order to prompt his discharge.\n\n              Appellants make a final merits-related claim of qualified\n\nimmunity.       The interplay between qualified immunity and First\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\fAmendment violations is a difficult subject, partly because the\n\nformer normally employs an objective standard and the latter–-in\n\ncontrast to the ordinary Fourth Amendment claim--turns heavily upon\n\nmotive.   This does not mean that qualified immunity can never\n\nsucceed in a First Amendment case, see Dirrane v. Brookline Police\n\nDept., 315 F.3d 65, 69-71 (1st Cir. 2002), but only that the\n\nopportunities may be narrowed.\n\n          On appeal, appellants’ brief describes qualified immunity\n\ndoctrine in general terms but makes no effort to apply it to the\n\nfacts of this case.   An argument not seriously developed in the\n\nopening brief is forfeit, see United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1,\n\n17 (1st Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1082 (1990), and that\n\nrule certainly applies in this case.     Given that the jury almost\n\nsurely found that appellants’ purpose was improper retaliation, it\n\nis not clear how a qualified immunity defense could easily have\n\nprevailed.\n\n          As for damages, the award of damages corresponds to\n\nTejada’s lost police salary between the period of his discharge and\n\nthe date of judgment in this case.      Appellants say that the jury\n\nshould have subtracted amounts Tejada apparently earned from other\n\nodd jobs during this period (for example, at a gasoline station).\n\nBut it might well have been for appellants to elicit such proof,\n\ncf. Conetta v. Nat'l Hair Care Ctrs., Inc., 236 F.3d 67, 77 (1st\n\n\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fCir. 2001) (mitigation), and they may be fortunate not to have been\n\nheld liable for future wages as well.\n\n          The district court has detailed the relevant evidence and\n\ncalculations   that    may     have   led   a   jury   rationally--even\n\n\"conservative[ly]\"--to set compensatory damages at $125,000. Faced\n\nwith the \"formidable burden\" of showing that the district court\n\nabused its discretion in rejecting their motion for remittitur,\n\nDavignon v. Clemmey, 322 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir. 2003), appellants\n\nhave not come close.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                             Dissent follows.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\f            CARTER, Senior District Judge, dissenting.          The majority\n\nopinion    in    this   case   represents   a   startling   anomaly    in   the\n\nestablished jurisprudence of American compensatory justice–-it\n\nholds that Plaintiffs may recover damages where it is established\n\nwithout question and as a matter of law that no action of the\n\nDefendants proximately caused the damages for which recovery is\n\nallowed.        The   majority   founds   the   result   upon   an   attempted\n\ndistinction of the case of Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ.\n\nv. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274 (1977), and its own views of correct\n\n“policy” in the application of a holding of the United States\n\nSupreme Court.        See maj. op. at 11-12.\n\n            I believe that a proper analysis in this case should look\n\nto the posture in which the case was submitted to the jury.\n\nThereafter, the application of the clearly articulated holding of\n\nthe United States Supreme Court in Mt. Healthy yields the proper\n\nresult.    There should be neither occasion nor need to create a\n\ncircuit “policy” to abrogate the rule of Mt. Healthy.                 Law, not\n\nlocal “policy,” should control the result in this case. Hence, the\n\ncause for my dissent.\n\n            The majority opinion correctly describes the conduct of\n\nAlvarez and Morales.        However, the record clearly shows that the\n\nconduct of these underlings, even if improperly motivated, never\n\ncame to the knowledge or attention of Secretary Fuentes, who is the\n\nofficial who made and executed the decision to discharge the\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\fPlaintiff.   It is undisputed that Fuentes was the “final decision-\n\nmaker.”   The majority opinion specifically recognizes that:\n\n     Gierbolini [the incoming acting director] recommended to\n     the newly appointed Secretary of Justice, Jose Fuentes\n     Agostini, that Tejada be discharged for the 1993 domestic\n     violence conviction on the ground that someone with this\n     record should not be a police agent.\n\nMaj. op. at 6 (emphasis added).\n\n           Fuentes executed Plaintiff’s discharge papers about three\n\nweeks later.   There is not a scintilla of evidence in this record,\n\nnor do I understand the majority to make any assertion to the\n\ncontrary, that Fuentes ever had communicated to him or that he\n\ndiscovered by any other means any other reason to discharge the\n\nPlaintiff than the one he gave (e.g., Plaintiff’s prior domestic\n\nviolence conviction). The majority states that the hearing officer\n\nwho reviewed Fuentes’ discharge action\n\n     recommended discharge because the conduct leading to\n     Tejada’s conviction represented, in violation of the\n     Bureau’s regulations, “improper behavior or [behavior]\n     damaging to the good name of the agency or the Government\n     of Puerto Rico” and “commission of acts for which it is\n     charged or may be charged a felony or misdemeanor crime.”\n\nId. at 6-7 (emphasis added).   There is no evidence that the hearing\n\nofficer had any knowledge of any basis for discharge of Plaintiff\n\nother than the referenced conviction.\n\n           The district court found at trial that it was Secretary\n\nFuentes who made the ultimate decision to terminate Mr. Tejada and\n\nthat Fuentes’ decision was based solely on Tejada’s conviction for\n\n\n\n                                -18-\n\fdomestic violence.4   When the district court granted Judgment as a\n\nMatter of Law, before submission of the case to the jury, in favor\n\nof Secretary Fuentes, it stated, as the basis for its ruling:\n\n     I’m dismissing the case as to the former Secretary of\n     Justice.   I find that there is no legally sufficient\n     evidentiary basis from which a reasonable jury can\n     determine that the motivating factor between the\n     dismissal letter, his action, and plaintiff’s actions,\n     that there was a motivating factor in freedom of speech,\n     in violation of his freedom of speech, and I find that\n     there is a very valid nondiscriminatory reason and that’s\n     what the evidence points to.\n\nAppendix Volume I, Trial Transcript at 276-77.   The district court\n\nreaffirmed its factual findings and legal conclusions based on\n\nthose findings in a post-trial Opinion and Order:\n\n     The evidence also demonstrated that Fuentes Agostini\n     signed plaintiff’s termination letter on February 27,\n     1997, adopting the recommendation of Miguel Gierbolini\n     that plaintiff be discharged for his domestic violence\n     conviction. Nothing in plaintiff’s evidence established\n     that Fuentes Agostini’s motivation for signing the\n     termination letter was in any way related to the\n     publication of the newspaper articles or plaintiff’s\n     denouncement of corruption. The evidence similarly fell\n     short of establishing Fuentes Agostini’s knowledge of\n     plaintiff’s    protected    expressions.       Plaintiff\n     nevertheless contends that a reasonable inference can be\n     drawn from the evidence presented. He suggests that from\n     the scanty evidence described above, a reasonable\n     inference can be made that co-defendant Fuentes Agostini\n\n\n     4\n      The district court’s findings on this point were not appealed\nare not called into question for review on this appeal. I also\nnote that on appeal Mr. Tejada argues that under Puerto Rican law\nan employee cannot be terminated for a conviction of domestic\nviolence when the employee has engaged as he did in a\nrehabilitation program. However, Mr. Tejada did not file a cross-\nappeal challenging the district court’s decision to grant Judgment\nas a Matter of Law to Secretary Fuentes.      Therefore, the Court\ncannot reconsider this issue on appeal.\n\n                                -19-\n\f     knew of the newspaper articles and was motivated by them.\n     He further claims that it is reasonable to expect that a\n     newly appointed Secretary of Justice will be informed of\n     all the media publications that relate to the Department\n     of Justice, and that when he signed the termination\n     letter he must have been presented with plaintiff’s file\n     in which the memoranda containing plaintiff’s expressions\n     were addressed.     All of these, plaintiff contends,\n     creates a reasonable inference that Fuentes Agostini was\n     motivated by the plaintiff’s exercise of First Amendment\n     rights at the time he signed the termination letter. I\n     disagree.\n\n     . . .\n\n     In this case plaintiff’s evidence of Fuentes Agostini’s\n     motivation is nothing but conjecture and guesswork.\n\n     . . .\n\n     There is simply nothing in the evidence proffered by\n     plaintiff to affirmatively link co-defendant Fuentes\n     Agostini to any intentional deprivation of constitutional\n     rights. All the evidence established is that he signed\n     the termination letter adopting the recommendation that\n     plaintiff had violated internal regulations and that his\n     domestic abuse conviction mandated dismissal. Plaintiff\n     has failed to “introduce[] at trial sufficiently adequate\n     evidence for the jury to determine the plausibility of”\n     co-defendant's [Fuentes'] motivations in order to survive\n     a motion under rule 50.\n\nTejada-Batista v. Fuentes Agostini, 251 F. Supp. 2d 1048, 1053-54\n\n(D.P.R. 2003) (emphasis added).5\n\n             Hence, the conduct and motivation of Ms. Morales and Mr.\n\nAlverez cannot be, as a matter of law, any part of a legally\n\nsufficient    causative   factor   in   Secretary   Fuentes’   employment\n\naction.   Even though the evidence might be construed to establish\n\n\n\n     5\n      Secretary Fuentes entered office in January 1997, after the\narticles were published in El Vocero.\n\n                                   -20-\n\fthat their termination recommendations were potentially driven by\n\nsome unconstitutional motivation, they cannot be liable under\n\nsection 1983 without some evidence of causation between that\n\nmotivation and the decision by Secretary Fuentes to discharge the\n\nPlaintiff. See Beattie v. Madison County Sch. Dist., 254 F.3d 595,\n\n605 (5th Cir. 2001); see also Johnson v. Johnson, 369 F.3d 826, 830\n\n(5th Cir. 2004) (“[I]f the decision-maker who imposed the adverse\n\nemployment action was not motivated by the speech, then the speech\n\ndid not cause the adverse employment action.”).\n\n           Here,   as   found   by   the    district     court,    there   is   no\n\nevidence that the final decision-maker, Secretary Fuentes, even\n\nknew of Mr. Tejada’s protected conduct. Indeed, the district court\n\nspecifically found that Secretary Fuentes made his own independent\n\ndecision to terminate Mr. Tejada based on Tejada’s prior domestic\n\nviolence conviction and that there was no evidence upon which to\n\nimpute any of Ms. Morales’ and Mr. Alverez’s motives to Secretary\n\nFuentes.    Without     at   least   being   able   to    impute    appellants’\n\nunlawful motives to Secretary Fuentes, those wrongful motives\n\ncannot be found to be a motivating factor in the adverse employment\n\naction.\n\n           Hence, the conduct of the minions, Morales and Alvarez,\n\nthat the majority imagines to be the “but for” cause of Plaintiff’s\n\ndischarge never, as a matter of law, had any legally cognizable\n\ninfluence or impact of any kind in bringing about the decision by\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\fFuentes, as affirmed by the reviewing hearing officer, to discharge\n\nthe Plaintiff. Any conclusion, even any inference, to the contrary\n\nis manifestly in conflict with the district court’s conclusion at\n\ntrial as a matter of law that Fuentes, the final decision-maker,\n\nacted without any improper knowledge or motivation. As a matter of\n\nlaw, there simply cannot be any causal link here between any\n\nsupposed   improper   motives   of   the   minions    and   the   discharge\n\nimplemented by Secretary Fuentes’ solitary decision to discharge\n\nplaintiff for a proper, stated reason.\n\n           It is precisely the purpose and role of the holding in\n\nMt. Healthy to cut off such noncontributory conduct from serving as\n\nan efficient causal link to support recovery of damages where the\n\nDefendant puts forth a legitimate reason for the discharge.            The\n\nUnited States Supreme Court had its own “policy” basis for casting\n\nthat holding out into the world of legal precedent; it stated that\n\npolicy to be its response to fairness considerations that may arise\n\nin the course of truly mixed motive cases.           I believe that it is\n\nwrong for the majority to casually shunt aside a clearly applicable\n\nholding of the Supreme Court in reliance on its own previously\n\n\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\funrecognized “policy”6 of aversion to rigid rules of burden-of-\n\nproof allocation.\n\n            In the Mt. Healthy case, the challenged employment action\n\nin question consisted of facts that the superintendent of the\n\nDefendant school system recommended to the School Board at year-end\n\nthat the Plaintiff, along with nine other teachers, not be rehired\n\nand   the    action   of    the     School   Board    in   accepting   that\n\nrecommendation.       The   Court   expressly    established   “a   rule   of\n\ncausation,” 429 U.S. at 285, that did not focus solely on whether\n\nthe protected conduct “played a part, ‘substantial’ or otherwise,\n\nin a decision not to rehire . . . .”            Id.   It found such a rule\n\nwould unfairly unbalance the framework of permitted decision-\n\nmaking.     The evil addressed by the holding was stated to be that:\n\n      A borderline or marginal candidate should not have the\n      employment question resolved against him because of\n      constitutionally protected conduct.       But that same\n      candidate ought not to be able, by engaging in such\n      conduct, to prevent his employer from assessing his\n      performance record and reaching a decision not to rehire\n      on the basis of that record, simply because the protected\n      conduct makes the employer more certain of the\n      correctness of its decision.\n\n\n      6\n      The majority states, “The question is whether the intervening\nsteps--a final decision-maker acting on a permissible ground--\nshould as a matter of policy (not lack of causation) insulate the\nwrongdoer from liability.” Id. at 12 (emphasis added).\n\n     This formulation evades rational footing as Mt. Healthy\nestablishes it to be the dominant legal policy that “lack of\ncausation” does, in fact, insulate from liability one whose conduct\nis not a motivating factor for the wrongful employment action. The\nmajority has substituted its own policy for the holding of the\nUnited States Supreme Court.\n\n                                     -23-\n\fId. at 286.   The Court went on to state:\n\n      [I]n other areas of constitutional law, this Court has\n      found it necessary to formulate a test of causation which\n      distinguishes between a result caused by a constitutional\n      violation and one not so caused.     We think those are\n      instructive in formulating the test to be applied here.\n\nId.\n\n           After reviewing a compendium of cases that it found to be\n\ninstructive, the Court found:\n\n      that the proper test to apply in the present context is\n      one . . . which protects against the invasion of\n      constitutional rights without commanding undesirable\n      consequences not necessary to assure those rights.\n\nId. at 287.   Accordingly, it held that the appropriate analytical\n\ninquiry, in terms of causation, should go beyond the question of\n\nwhether   constitutionally   protected    conduct   was   a   “motivating\n\nfactor” and that a determination should be made as to whether the\n\nDefendant would have taken the same employment action “even in the\n\nabsence of the protected conduct.”       Id.   The failure of the court\n\nbelow to reach that second question was found to require reversal\n\nin Mt. Healthy.   In the present case the court below did reach that\n\nsecond question and did resolve it, but in a way that the Mt.\n\nHealthy holding clearly contemplates requires that these Defendants\n\nbe “insulated from liability.”7\n\n\n      7\n      I believe that the majority’s fundamental error here lies in\nits inability to accept and respect the fact that a seminal mistake\nwas made by the district court at trial when it made the ruling\ninsulating Secretary Fuentes from liability on the causation\nanalysis of Mt. Healthy and then failed to recognize that its\nruling also should have necessarily insulated Morales and Alvarez\n\n                                -24-\n\f              This result has very recently been recognized as the\n\ncorrect application of the holding of Mt. Healthy by another panel\n\nof this Court in the case of Webber v. International Paper Co., 417\n\nF.3d 229 (1st Cir. 2005).        There, the question was whether the\n\nmotivations of the Plaintiff’s immediate supervisors, Schaub and\n\nMoser, could be taken to be adequate circumstantial evidence that\n\nthe final decision-maker, Oetinger, who testified that Schaub and\n\nMoser neither participated in nor contributed to the decision,\n\nacted from an improper motivation in taking the adverse employment\n\naction   in    question.   The   Court    there   stated,   “[t]he   pivotal\n\nquestion thus becomes: whether the jury could rationally infer from\n\n\nfrom liability.    If it be correct that Fuentes is not liable\nbecause there is no causal link between his discharge action and\nthe purportedly improper motivations of the minions, then it must\nalso be that the minions are not liable because there is no causal\nlink between their supposed motivations and the damage caused by\nthe proper discharge by Fuentes.\n\n     Hence, once the district court made its ruling in favor of\nFuentes, it should have also granted judgment in favor of Morales\nand Alvarez on the basis of that ruling. It was legally wrong to\nsubmit the case to the jury as to them because there was no\nevidentiary predicate, on the court’s own finding, on which\ncausation could be sustained.\n\n     I believe that it is not proper, as the majority would do,\nsimply to ignore the fact that there is no rational basis in the\nrecord for these Defendants’ liability.       It is not right or\nreasonable to ignore the occurrence of and the legal significance\nof the error and to bless a judgment that is patently without any\nfoundation in the law.     A simple recognition of the force and\neffect of the error in assessing these Defendants’ liability (e.g.,\nthat the judgment imposes liability without causation) will yield\na legally sustainable result and respect the rights of these\nDefendants and the Agency to be insulated from liability because\nthe Agency’s final decision-maker acted properly.\n\n                                   -25-\n\fthese    record   facts   that   Moser   [the   underling]   conceivably\n\n‘influenced’ the decision to fire [the plaintiff].”          Id. at 237.\n\nConcluding that the evidence would not support such an inference,\n\nthe panel found that Plaintiff, “failed to meet his burden of proof\n\nto show that the proximate cause of his termination was [defendant\n\nemployer’s] discriminatory animus.”       Id. at 240 (emphasis added).\n\nThus, causation, not local circuit “policy,” was taken to drive the\n\ndecision to affirm the district court’s grant of Judgment as a\n\nMatter of Law to the Defendant.\n\n           The Webber case is a clear application of the Mt. Healthy\n\nrule requiring the presence of causational linkage between the\n\nconduct of those who are found to harbor discriminatory motivation\n\nand the making of the actual, challenged employment decision.         It\n\nis, I suggest, not proper for this panel to depart from this\n\nholding.    In this Circuit, each panel of the Court is bound by\n\nprior panel decisions directly on point. Jusino v. Sayas, 875 F.2d\n\n986, 993 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n           The seminal holding of Webber, for present purposes, is\n\nthat where the evidence fails to show that the final decision-maker\n\nis influenced adversely by the motivation of lower level actors,\n\nthe type and level of causation required by Mt. Healthy is absent\n\nand must be recognized.8    A second echelon of “but for” causational\n\n\n     8\n      The majority attempts to dismiss the controlling effect of\nWebber by two peremptory and unexplained asides: (1) that the\nWebber panel “appears to assume arguendo” that the tainted action\n\n                                  -26-\n\fof an underling communicated to a pure-minded supervisor may be the\nbasis for liability, and (2) that the Court found that the superior\n“had determined to terminate the employee on legitimate grounds\nbefore any contact with the supervisor [occurred] and that the\nsupervisor had no causal influence on the firing.” Maj. op. at 13\n(emphasis in original).\n\n     Both of these observations strike me as irrelevancies in\nunderstanding the Webber opinion, and they perpetuate the\nmajority’s unwillingness to recognize the direct and focused thrust\nof the holding in Mt. Healthy (e.g. that a pure-minded final\ndecision-maker is, in effect, an efficient intervening cause\ndestroying the existence of proximate cause between the adverse\nanimus of others than the final decision-maker and the damage\nresulting from the employment decision).\n\n     The factual circumstances in Webber were that the underlings,\nSchaub and Moser, had made remarks that plaintiff claimed showed\nthat they harbored discriminatory intent toward the plaintiff.\nThere was no evidence that they ever told Oettinger, the final\ndecision-maker, that plaintiff should be discharged in the RIF.\nThe panel concluded that it would be, on the record, excessively\nspeculative for a jury to conclude that “Moser conceivably\n‘influenced’ the decision to fire [the plaintiff].” Id. at 237.\nThe record showed, the panel found, that Oettinger, the plaintiff’s\nultimate superior and final decision-maker, had decided for proper\nreasons, to discharge the plaintiff.        He then went to the\nunderlings, Schaub and Moser, to notify them of his initial\ndecision, not to seek their opinion, but rather to ascertain if he,\nOettinger, had missed “any material termination-related facts.”\nId. Schaub and Moser simply acquiesced in the decision, apparently\nwithout comment.     The plaintiff conceded that they did not\ncommunicate to Oettinger any discriminatory animus that they may,\nin fact, have harbored. Id. at 236. Oettinger implemented the\ndecision to discharge plaintiff.\n\n     What the panel “assumed arguendo” was clearly stated by the\npanel in the opinion.\n\n     [W]e shall assume arguendo that, even in the absence of\n     any ... direct, affirmative communication between\n     Oettinger and Moser, a supervisor’s silence (viz., his\n     discriminatory failure to utilize the veto power\n     conferred upon him by his employer) could constitute\n     sufficient \"participation\" or \"influence\" to warrant\n     imputing [the supervisor’s] purported animus to [the\n\n                               -27-\n\fconduct will not suffice to bridge the gap between liability and\n\ndamage that is created by the absence of motivated causational\n\nconduct of the final decision-maker.   This case is much stronger\n\nthan Webber because here that absence is established in the record\n\nwhereas in Webber the contrary was established by concession of the\n\nPlaintiff (assuming the record is to be given any weight in\n\nappellate consideration) as a matter of law.\n\n          I suggest this panel is properly bound by the holding of\n\nthe Webber case since it has not been subsequently overruled and no\n\nother exceptional circumstances apply to call in question the\n\n\n\n     final decision-maker].\n\nId. at 237. This appears to me to be an appropriate understanding\nof the law under Mt. Healthy.\n\n     However, that understanding does not have the effect on the\napplication of Webber here that the majority attribute to it. The\noperative finding of the panel in Webber was not that Oettinger\nmade the discharge decision before consulting with Schaub and Moser\nbut rather that he made it without any influence from them, and it\nis easily argued from the panel’s language that the panel assumed\nthat had there been any evidence that the underlings had a bad\nanimus toward plaintiff, the failure to exercise in favor of\nplaintiff the implicit “veto power” Oettinger gave them by\nconsulting with them would have been a sufficient causative\n“influence” upon the final decision-maker for Mt.

The underlying events are easily described; the complications arise out of governing legal doctrine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1987, Tejada began working as a law enforcement agent in the Special Investigations Bureau (\"the bureau\") of the PRJD. After other stints, Tejada was assigned in 1995 to the bureau's organized crime division, where he operated undercover, infiltrating Dominican drug trafficking rings. According to Tejada's later testimony, he came to be troubled by certain \"irregularities\": drug busts called off on the eve of arrest, without explanation; misuse of funds by another agent; and shady dealings by a government informant named Ivan Merced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tejada reported these concerns to Antonio Franco (his supervisor) and to the two higher officials later held liable to Tejada in this case: Domingo Alvarez (division head) and Lydia Morales (bureau director). No action was taken in response to his complaints. Worse still, a trafficker named Hernandez told Tejada that Merced had disclosed to gang members Tejada's identity as an undercover officer. When Tejada so advised Franco, Franco threatened to discipline Tejada for speaking to Hernandez without authorization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, a hit man whom Tejada had helped put in prison was released and, Tejada believed, began to search for Tejada. Fearing for his family's safety and his own, Tejada asked Franco for a transfer out of his division. Tejada then wrote to Morales, setting forth his complaints about Merced, the threat the latter posed to investigations, and the threat posed by the hit man.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales responded by transferring Tejada into what Tejada described as a dead-end job at bureau headquarters, one that often left him without any work to do. After receiving a number of threatening phone calls at his home, Tejada contacted Franco and Alvarez, who did not respond to his concerns. In May 1996, Tejada was activated for National Guard duty; Morales accused him of abusing military leave and withheld his pay. Eventually, in January 1997, Tejada moved his family to Florida at his own expense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 1996, Tejada, while still on leave, spoke with a reporter for the <i>El Vocero</i> newspaper; on December 10, a short article appeared, entitled \"S.I.B. Director and Assistant Denied Agent Transfer Although His Life Was in Danger.\" The next day, another appeared with the title, \"Domingo Alvarez of the S.I.B. Forbids Arrest in Drug Transactions.\" The articles touched on the problems Tejada had complained of internally; each cited Tejada as a source.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first short article, in substance, reported that Morales and Alvarez failed to protect Tejada despite threats on his life; that when he was transferred, it was only to an \"inoperative section\"; that Alvarez quashed another agent's complaint by threatening a transfer like Tejada's; and that Tejada had no regular car to use while at his new job, since the bureau prohibited agents from using their private cars and claimed that there were insufficient cars available.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second article alleged that Alvarez once suddenly and without explanation cancelled an imminent drug bust. It also said that a certain \"Ivan Rodriguez\"&#8212;a disguised name for the informant Ivan Merced&#8212;had blown Tejada's cover, \"ruined\" expensive investigations, was \"negotiating drug transactions\" without authorization from the bureau, and \"was working for the Bureau and for the underworld.\" It described one investigation involving Merced as follows (in translation):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Tejada] alleges that the confidant ruined an investigation in which a 50 kilos (which is valued at about $250,000) transaction was going to be made and \"which was going great and overnight it was ruined.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the day the second article appeared, Alvarez sent Morales a memorandum recommending Tejada's discharge on the basis of his leaks, saying that they endangered both an investigation that was \"still open\" and the life of the informant. The next day, Alvarez wrote another memorandum to Morales, again recommending discharge&#8212;this time prompted (supposedly) by an anonymous tip saying that Tejada had, in 1993, been convicted of domestic abuse. Whether Alvarez had earlier known of the conviction was disputed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 1993 conviction, which occurred while Tejada was on military leave, resulted from Tejada's hitting his wife, but it had been formally expunged by court order when Tejada completed a rehabilitation or \"diversion\" program. Alvarez's memorandum to Morales mentions the diversion program, but not that its completion entailed erasure of Tejada's conviction (even though he later testified that he knew diversion entailed expungement).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales, who was stepping down as bureau director, passed both of Alvarez's memoranda&#8212;one about the leaks, the other about the past conviction&#8212;to the incoming acting director (Morales's own former deputy), Miguel Gierbolini. On February 4, 1997, Gierbolini recommended to the newly appointed Secretary of Justice, Jos&#233; Fuentes Agostini, that Tejada be discharged for the 1993 domestic violence conviction on the ground that someone with this record should not be a police agent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fuentes signed Tejada's termination papers on February 27, 1997; Tejada, still on military leave, learned of this in early March, and an informal agency hearing was held on November 17, 1997. The hearing officer recommended discharge because the conduct leading to Tejada's conviction represented, in violation of the bureau's regulations, \"improper behavior or [behavior] damaging to the good name of the agency or the Government of Puerto Rico\" and \"commission of acts for which is charged or may be charged a felony or misdemeanor crime.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tejada brought suit in federal district court, seeking damages and injunctive relief under section 1983, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 (2000), for violation of his First Amendment rights. Named as defendants were Fuentes, Morales, Alvarez, Gierbolini, Franco, two other supervisors named Cristobal Irrizary and Ernesto Fern&#225;ndez, and an unnamed PRJD employee. Defense motions for summary judgment based on qualified immunity were denied, but the court eventually dismissed the claims against Fuentes, Fern&#225;ndez, and Irrizary for lack of evidence to support liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In dismissing the claim against Fuentes, the judge said that the evidence was insufficient as to motive, as it \"point[ed] to\" a \"very valid, nondiscriminatory reason.\" He later explained in a written opinion:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in the plaintiff's evidence established that [Secretary] Fuentes Agostini's motivation for signing the termination letter was in any way related to the publication of the newspaper articles or plaintiff's denouncement of corruption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, the evidence showed that Fuentes had merely \"signed the termination letter adopting a recommendation\" based on Tejada's prior conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the remaining defendants, the judge wrote that \"[t]here is sufficient evidence ... from which a reasonable trier of fact could find in favor of plaintiff.\" He noted Tejada's internal complaints of corruption, appellants' inaction, the timing of Alvarez's memoranda, the possibility that Alvarez had long known of the conviction, and Morales' role in forwarding the memoranda to Gierbolini. In other words, the judge thought that their motive could be deemed retaliatory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 27, 2003, after a four-day trial, the jury returned a verdict against Morales and Alvarez, assessing damages of $125,000 for Tejada's lost income. The district court denied post-trial motions for judgment in favor of the defendants, a new trial, and remittitur. Morales and Alvarez now appeal, contesting both the verdict against them and the amount of damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appeal implicates several different bodies of court-created law, beginning with the cause of action itself. Although the section 1983 cause of action is statutory, the substance of the claim here derives from Supreme Court precedents construing the First Amendment. In a nutshell, the <i>Pickering/Connick</i> line of decisions forbids officials from firing an employee for \"protected speech\" unless under a balancing test the governmental interests outweigh the need for protection.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The claim thus turns in the first instance on the nature of the speech, the balancing of interests, and the motivation for the firing. In this instance, the defendants concede for purposes of this appeal that Tejada's \"speech\"&#8212;his disclosures to the reporter&#8212;was at least in part protected speech under the governing case law. The disclosures, indeed, involved alleged serious mismanagement and possible corruption in the bureau, <i>see Guilloty Perez v. Pierluisi,</i> 339 F.3d 43, 52-53 (1st Cir.2003), and they occurred only after Tejada had properly sought relief through internal complaints, <i>cf. Wagner v. City of Holyoke,</i> 404 F.3d 504, 508 (1st Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"balancing\"&#8212;ordinarily a question of law for the court&#8212;is a much closer question. The defendants argue that Tejada potentially endangered the life of an informant (Ivan) and could have jeopardized ongoing investigations. This solicitude may appear to contrast with defendants' own limited interest in Tejada's safety. Furthermore, only Ivan's first name was revealed, and Ivan was himself in jail (for unauthorized drug dealing while acting as an informant) by the time of the newspaper reports.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, had Tejada been fired <i>because</i> he revealed information jeopardizing an informant and an ongoing investigation, defendants would have an excellent argument that Tejada was fired for unprotected speech. <i>See United States v. Chagra,</i> 701 F.2d 354, 365 (5th Cir.1983). However, so far as Morales and Alvarez were responsible for the firing&#8212;a separate question to which we will return&#8212;the jury could on the evidence before it conclude that their motives were not based on these concerns about Ivan and the investigation, but that they acted because of Tejada's protected speech.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tejada's main disclosures were of mismanagement and possible corruption; hostility to him had been demonstrated because of his internal complaints well before his newspaper disclosures; and the addition of the domestic violence charge could have been viewed as a gratuitous gesture undermining the claim by appellants that they were centrally concerned with the threat to Ivan or ongoing investigations. In short, the jury could have concluded that the appellants acted <i>because</i> of Tejada's protected speech.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The focus of the appellants' brief, so far as liability is concerned, is on a multi-step claim: that Fuentes, not the appellants, fired Tejada; that Fuentes did so on an entirely different ground unconnected with protected speech; and that these circumstances insulate the appellants from liability under the so-called <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense, which arises where the firing would have occurred even without the protected speech. <i>See Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle,</i> 429 U.S. 274, 287, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To start with the factual premises, we agree that Fuentes purported to discharge Tejada because of the domestic violence conviction, and for the present appeal we accept that this was indeed Fuentes's ground. This is <i>not</i> because the district court's ruling to this effect binds us, as appellants assert, but because there is no direct evidence that Fuentes acted on any other ground.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> A circumstantial case to the contrary might be attempted (based on implausibility), but it would not be easy and Tejada does not attempt such an attack on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Strictly speaking, <i>Mt. Healthy</i> is not on point here. It deals with actions taken by an official or agency out of \"mixed motives.\" It says, in substance, that where there was a permissible and impermissible ground for a firing, the impermissible ground should be ignored where the employee would have been discharged anyway based on the permissible motive. Although clear policy considerations are invoked, the main rationale is that in such a case the impermissible ground was not a but-for cause of the firing; it would have happened anyway. 429 U.S. at 285-87, 97 S.Ct. 568.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, <i>Mt. Healthy</i> comports with the traditional tort-law principle that if the wrongful act did not <i>cause</i> the injury, the wrongdoer is not liable. <i>See Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts,</i> &#167; 41 at 263 (5th ed.1984). By contrast, in this case, the actions of the appellants <i>were</i> a \"but-for\" cause of Tejada's firing. The jury could easily have concluded that Tejada would not have been fired if appellants had not disclosed Tejada's prior conviction and passed along the recommendation to Fuentes. The appellants' actions were also surely a \"proximate cause\" as well, in the sense that the result was foreseeable (indeed, desired).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So the problem in this case is not one of a single actor with multiple motives, but of sequential actors having different motives&#8212;the first actor's motive being unlawful and the second actor's motive at least permissible. In such a case, the first actor may be (and here was) a but-for cause of the firing. The question is whether the intervening step&#8212;a final decision maker acting on a permissible ground&#8212;should as a matter of policy (not lack of causation) insulate the wrongdoer from liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have found only a few circuits that have addressed this sequence-of-actors issue in the present context, and they are nominally in conflict. The Fifth Circuit says that the final action by the properly motived superior insulates the ill-motivated subordinate, <i>Beattie v. Madison County Sch. Dist.,</i> 254 F.3d 595, 603-05 (5th Cir.2001); three other circuits say that the subordinate remains liable if he is a but-for cause of the firing, <i>Gilbrook v. City of Westminster,</i> 177 F.3d 839, 854-56 (9th Cir.1999), <i>cert. denied,</i> 528 U.S. 1061, 120 S.Ct. 614, 145 L.Ed.2d 509 (1999); <i>Saye v. St. Vrain Valley Sch. Dist.,</i> 785 F.2d 862, 867 (10th Cir.1986); <i>Hickman v. Valley Local Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ.,</i> 619 F.2d 606, 610 (6th Cir.1980). Whether any of these cases intends a wholly mechanical rule in all cases is open to doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our own recent decision in <i>Webber v. Int'l Paper Co.,</i> 417 F.3d 229 (1st Cir.2005), far from assisting appellants, appears to assume <i>arguendo</i> that a tainted adverse recommendation from a supervisor to a superior might create liability even if the superior's own motive was pure. Ultimately, the court did not decide the issue; it found that (unlike the present case) the superior had determined to terminate the employee on legitimate grounds <i>before</i> any contact with the supervisor and that the supervisor had no causal influence on the firing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any case, a rigid rule would not comport with sound policy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Suppose that the appellants had disclosed that Tejada was taking payoffs from the mob and Fuentes had discharged Tejada on that basis; it is hard to imagine any court upholding damages to Tejada for the firing, even if appellants' motives were unlawful. Conversely, suppose in retaliation for protected speech the appellants misled Fuentes into thinking that Tejada had shirked his duties; surely they should be held liable even if Fuentes's own motives were innocent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our case falls between such extremes. Even accepting that Fuentes' own motive was \"pure,\" a jury could reasonably doubt that the firing would have occurred if Fuentes had stumbled across the prior conviction on his own. Appellants cite authority under Puerto Rico law for discharging a police officer for domestic abuse. But here Tejada's conviction was over three years old, and the conviction had been expunged under local law after he had received counseling. It is highly unlikely that absent the appellants' prompting, the firing was inevitable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor was Tejada's misconduct of such a kind that would make it unthinkable to retain him as a policeman after its disclosure, as would be the case if he was guilty of mob ties or murder. His misconduct was serious, to be sure; but it was one incident, well in the past, and Tejada had been rehabilitated. This is not a case in which it offends public policy to sanction a defendant who, for improper reasons, revealed Tejada's earlier offense in order to prompt his discharge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants make a final merits-related claim of qualified immunity. The interplay between qualified immunity and First Amendment violations is a difficult subject, partly because the former normally employs an objective standard and the latter&#8212;in contrast to the ordinary Fourth Amendment claim&#8212;turns heavily upon motive. This does not mean that qualified immunity can never succeed in a First Amendment case, <i>see Dirrane v. Brookline Police Dept.,</i> 315 F.3d 65, 69-71 (1st Cir.2002), but only that the opportunities may be narrowed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, appellants' brief describes qualified immunity doctrine in general terms but makes no effort to apply it to the facts of this case. An argument not seriously developed in the opening brief is forfeit, <i>see United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990), <i>cert. denied,</i> 494 U.S. 1082, 110 S.Ct. 1814, 108 L.Ed.2d 944 (1990), and that rule certainly applies in this case. Given that the jury almost surely found that appellants' <i>purpose</i> was improper retaliation, it is not clear how a qualified immunity defense could easily have prevailed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for damages, the award of damages corresponds to Tejada's lost police salary between the period of his discharge and the date of judgment in this case. Appellants say that the jury should have subtracted amounts Tejada apparently earned from other odd jobs during this period (for example, at a gasoline station). But it might well have been for appellants to elicit such proof, <i>cf. Conetta v. Nat'l Hair Care Ctrs., Inc.,</i> 236 F.3d 67, 77 (1st Cir.2001) (mitigation), and they may be fortunate not to have been held liable for future wages as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court has detailed the relevant evidence and calculations that may have led a jury rationally-even \"conservative[ly]\"&#8212;to set compensatory damages at $125,000. Faced with the \"formidable burden\" of showing that the district court abused its discretion in rejecting their motion for remittitur, <i>Davignon v. Clemmey,</i> 322 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir.2003), appellants have not come close.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Maine, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> <i>See Pickering v.

The majority founds the result upon an attempted distinction of the case of <i>Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v.

Thereafter, the application of the clearly articulated holding of the United States Supreme Court in <i>Mt. Healthy</i> yields the proper result. There should be neither occasion nor need to create a circuit \"policy\" to abrogate the rule of <i>Mt. Healthy.</i> Law, not local \"policy,\" should control the result in this case.

However, the record clearly shows that the conduct of these underlings, even if improperly motivated, never came to the knowledge or attention of Secretary Fuentes, who is the official who made and executed the decision to discharge the Plaintiff. It is undisputed that Fuentes was the \"final decision-maker.\" The majority opinion specifically recognizes that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gierbolini [the incoming acting director] recommended to the newly appointed Secretary of Justice, Jose Fuentes Agostini, that Tejada be discharged <i>for the 1993 domestic violence conviction on the ground that someone with this record should not be a police agent.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Maj. op.</i> at 99 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fuentes executed Plaintiff's discharge papers about three weeks later. There is not a scintilla of evidence in this record, nor do I understand the majority to make any assertion to the contrary, that Fuentes ever had communicated to him or that he discovered by any other means any other reason to discharge the Plaintiff than the one he gave (e.g., Plaintiff's prior domestic violence conviction). The majority states that the hearing officer who reviewed Fuentes' discharge action</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">recommended discharge because <i>the conduct leading to Tejada's conviction</i> represented, in violation of the Bureau's regulations, \"improper behavior or [behavior] damaging to the good name of the agency or the Government of Puerto Rico\" and \"commission of acts for which it is charged or may be charged a felony or misdemeanor crime.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 99 - 100 (emphasis added).

The district court reaffirmed its factual findings and legal conclusions based on those findings in a post-trial Opinion and Order: The evidence also demonstrated that Fuentes Agostini signed plaintiff's termination letter on February 27, 1997, adopting the recommendation of Miguel Gierbolini that plaintiff be discharged for <i>his domestic violence conviction. Nothing in plaintiff's evidence established that Fuentes Agostini's motivation for signing the termination letter was in any way related to the publication of the newspaper articles or plaintiff's denouncement of corruption.</i> The evidence similarly fell short of establishing Fuentes Agostini's knowledge of plaintiff's protected expressions. Plaintiff nevertheless contends that a reasonable inference can be drawn from the evidence presented. He suggests that from the scanty evidence described above, a reasonable inference can be made that co-defendant Fuentes Agostini knew of the newspaper articles and was motivated by them. He further claims that it is reasonable to expect that a newly appointed Secretary of Justice will be informed of all the media publications that relate to the Department of Justice, and that when he signed the termination letter he must have been presented with plaintiff's file in which the memoranda containing plaintiff's expressions were addressed. All of these, plaintiff contends, creates a reasonable inference that Fuentes Agostini was motivated by the plaintiff's exercise of First Amendment rights at the time he signed the termination letter. I disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>In this case plaintiff's evidence of Fuentes Agostini's motivation is nothing but conjecture and guesswork.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is simply nothing in the evidence proffered by plaintiff <i>to affirmatively link co-defendant Fuentes Agostini to any intentional deprivation of constitutional rights.</i> All the evidence established is that he signed the termination letter adopting the recommendation that plaintiff had violated internal regulations <i>and that his domestic abuse conviction mandated dismissal.</i> Plaintiff has failed to \"introduce[] at trial sufficiently adequate evidence for the jury to determine the plausibility of\" co-defendant's [Fuentes'] motivations in order to survive a motion under rule 50.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Tejada-Batista v. Fuentes Agostini,</i> 251 F.Supp.2d 1048, 1053-54 (D.P.R.2003) (emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hence, the conduct and motivation of Ms. Morales and Mr. Alverez cannot be, as a matter of law, any part of a legally sufficient causative factor in Secretary Fuentes' employment action. Even though the evidence <i>might</i> be construed to establish that <i>their</i> termination recommendations were potentially driven by some unconstitutional motivation, they cannot be liable under section 1983 without some evidence of causation between that motivation and the decision by Secretary Fuentes to discharge the Plaintiff. <i>See Beattie v. Madison County Sch. Dist.,</i> 254 F.3d 595, 605 (5th Cir.2001); <i>see also Johnson v. state,</i> 369 F.3d 826, 830 (5th Cir.2004) (\"[I]f the decision-maker who imposed the adverse employment action was not motivated by the speech, then the speech did not cause the adverse employment action.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, as found by the district court, there is no <i>evidence</i> that the final decision-maker, Secretary Fuentes, even knew of Mr. Tejada's protected conduct. Indeed, the district court specifically found that Secretary Fuentes made his own independent decision to terminate Mr. Tejada <i>based on Tejada's prior domestic violence conviction</i> and that there was no evidence upon which to impute any of Ms. Morales' and Mr. Alverez's motives to Secretary Fuentes. Without at least being able to impute appellants' unlawful motives to Secretary Fuentes, those wrongful motives cannot be found to be a <i>motivating</i> factor in the adverse employment action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hence, the conduct of the minions, Morales and Alvarez, that the majority imagines to be the \"but for\" cause of Plaintiff's discharge never, as a matter of law, had any legally cognizable influence or impact of any kind in bringing about <i>the decision</i> by Fuentes, as affirmed by the reviewing hearing officer, to discharge the Plaintiff. Any conclusion, even any inference, to the contrary is manifestly in conflict with the district court's conclusion at trial <i>as a matter of law</i> that Fuentes, the final decision-maker, acted without any improper knowledge or motivation. As a matter of law, there simply cannot be any causal link here between any supposed improper motives of the minions and the discharge implemented by Secretary Fuentes' solitary decision to discharge plaintiff for a proper, stated reason.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is precisely the purpose and role of the holding in <i>Mt. Healthy</i> to cut off such noncontributory conduct from serving as an efficient causal link to support recovery of damages where the Defendant puts forth a legitimate reason for the discharge. The United States Supreme Court had its own \"policy\" basis for casting that holding out into the world of legal precedent; it stated that policy to be its response to fairness considerations that may arise in the course of truly mixed motive cases. I believe that it is wrong for the majority to casually shunt aside a clearly applicable holding of the Supreme Court in reliance on its own previously unrecognized \"policy\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> of aversion to rigid rules of burden-of-proof allocation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the <i>Mt. Healthy</i> case, the challenged employment action in question consisted of facts that the superintendent of the Defendant school system recommended to the School Board at year-end that the Plaintiff, along with nine other teachers, not be rehired and the action of the School Board in accepting that recommendation. The Court expressly established \"a rule of causation,\" 429 U.S. at 285, 97 S.Ct. 568, that did not focus solely on whether the protected conduct \"played a part, `substantial' or otherwise, in a decision not to rehire....\" <i>Id.</i> It found such a rule would unfairly unbalance the framework of permitted decision-making. The evil addressed by the holding was stated to be that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A borderline or marginal candidate should not have the employment question resolved against him because of constitutionally protected conduct. But that same candidate ought not to be able, by engaging in such conduct, to prevent his employer from assessing his performance record and reaching a decision not to rehire on the basis of that record, simply because the protected conduct makes the employer more certain of the correctness of its decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 286, 97 S.Ct. 568. The Court went on to state:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[I]n other areas of constitutional law, this Court has found it necessary to formulate a test of causation which distinguishes between a result caused by a constitutional violation and one not so caused. We think those are instructive in formulating the test to be applied here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Id.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reviewing a compendium of cases that it found to be instructive, the Court found:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">that the proper test to apply in the present context is one... which protects against the invasion of constitutional rights without commanding undesirable consequences not necessary to assure those rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 287, 97 S.Ct. 568. Accordingly, it held that the appropriate analytical inquiry, in terms of causation, should go beyond the question of whether constitutionally protected conduct was a \"motivating factor\" and that a determination should be made as to whether the Defendant would have taken the same employment action \"even in the absence of the protected conduct.\" <i>Id.</i> The failure of the court below to reach that second question was found to require reversal in <i>Mt. Healthy.</i> In the present case the court below did reach that second question and did resolve it, but in a way that the <i>Mt. Healthy</i> holding clearly contemplates requires that these Defendants be \"insulated from liability.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This result has very recently been recognized as the correct application of the holding of <i>Mt. Healthy</i> by another panel of this Court in the case of <i>Webber v. International Paper Co.,</i> 417 F.3d 229 (1st Cir.2005). There, the question was whether the motivations of the Plaintiff's immediate supervisors, Schaub and Moser, could be taken to be adequate circumstantial evidence that the final decision-maker, Oetinger, who testified that Schaub and Moser neither participated in nor contributed to the decision, acted from an improper motivation in taking the adverse employment action in question. The Court there stated, \"[t]he pivotal question thus becomes: whether the jury could rationally infer from these record facts that Moser [the underling] conceivably `influenced' the decision to fire [the plaintiff].\" <i>Id.</i> at 237. Concluding that the evidence would not support such an inference, the panel found that Plaintiff, \"failed to meet his burden of proof to show that <i>the proximate cause</i> of his termination was [defendant employer's] discriminatory animus.\" <i>Id.</i> at 240 (emphasis added). Thus, causation, not local circuit \"policy,\" was taken to drive the decision to affirm the district court's grant of Judgment as a Matter of Law to the Defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Webber</i> case is a clear application of the <i>Mt. Healthy</i> rule requiring the presence of causational linkage between the conduct of those who are found to harbor discriminatory motivation and the making of the actual, challenged employment decision. It is, I suggest, not proper for this panel to depart from this holding. In this Circuit, each panel of the Court is bound by prior panel decisions directly on point. <i>Jusino v. Zayas,</i> 875 F.2d 986, 993 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The seminal holding of <i>Webber,</i> for present purposes, is that where the evidence fails to show that the final decision-maker is influenced adversely by the motivation of lower level actors, the type and level of causation required by <i>Mt. Healthy</i> is absent <i>and must be recognized.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> A second echelon of \"but for\" causational conduct will not suffice to bridge the gap between liability and damage that is created by the absence of <i>motivated</i> causational conduct of the final decision-maker. This case is much stronger than <i>Webber</i> because here that absence is established in the record whereas in <i>Webber</i> the contrary was established by concession of the Plaintiff (assuming the record is to be given any weight in appellate consideration) as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I suggest this panel is properly bound by the holding of the <i>Webber</i> case since it has not been subsequently overruled and no other exceptional circumstances apply to call in question the viability of that prior ruling. <i>Mainegeneral Medical Ceter v. Shalala,</i> 205 F.3d 493, 497 (1st Cir.2000); <i>Williams v. Ashland Engineering Co.,</i> 45 F.3d 588, 592 (1st Cir.1995). The <i>Webber</i> decision was recently rendered, on August 9, 2005, and there is no circumstance that postdates that decision, \"that offers a sound reason for believing that the former panel, in light of fresh developments, would change its collective mind.\" <i>Williams,</i> 45 F.3d at 592.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, I believe the judgment below should be reversed to comply with the applicable, direct holding of the United States Supreme Court in the <i>Mt. Healthy</i> case and the previously announced rule of decision in this Circuit under that precedent in the <i>Webber</i> case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The district court's findings on this point were not appealed are not called into question for review on this appeal. I also note that on appeal Mr. Tejada argues that under Puerto Rican law an employee cannot be terminated for a conviction of domestic violence when the employee has engaged as he did in a rehabilitation program. However, Mr. Tejada did not file a cross-appeal challenging the district court's decision to grant Judgment as a Matter of Law to Secretary Fuentes. Therefore, the Court cannot reconsider this issue on appeal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Secretary Fuentes entered office in January 1997, after the articles were published in El Vocero</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The majority states, \"The question is whether the intervening steps&#8212;a final decision-maker acting on a permissible ground&#8212;should<i>as a matter of policy</i> (not lack of causation) insulate the wrongdoer from liability.\" <i>Id.</i> at 12 (emphasis added).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">This formulation evades rational footing as <i>Mt. Healthy</i> establishes it to be the dominant <i>legal</i> policy that \"lack of causation\" does, in fact, insulate from liability one whose conduct is not a motivating factor for the wrongful employment action. The majority has substituted its own <i>policy</i> for the <i>holding</i> of the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> I believe that the majority's fundamental error here lies in its inability to accept and respect the fact that a seminal mistake was made by the district court at trial when it made the ruling insulating Secretary Fuentes from liability on the causation analysis of<i>Mt. Healthy</i> and then failed to recognize that its ruling also should have necessarily insulated Morales and Alvarez from liability. If it be correct that Fuentes is not liable because there is no causal link between his discharge action and the purportedly improper motivations of the minions, then it <i>must also be</i> that the minions are not liable because there is no causal link between their supposed motivations and the damage caused by the proper discharge by Fuentes.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Hence, once the district court made its ruling in favor of Fuentes, it should have also granted judgment in favor of Morales and Alvarez on the basis of that ruling. It was legally wrong to submit the case to the jury as to them because there was no evidentiary predicate, on the court's own finding, on which causation could be sustained.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">I believe that it is not proper, as the majority would do, simply to ignore the fact that there is no rational basis in the record for these Defendants' liability. It is not right or reasonable to ignore the occurrence of and the legal significance of the error and to bless a judgment that is patently without any foundation in the law. A simple recognition of the force and effect of the error in assessing these Defendants' liability (<i>e.g.,</i> that the judgment imposes liability without causation) will yield a legally sustainable result and respect the rights of these Defendants and the Agency to be insulated from liability because the Agency's final decision-maker acted properly.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The majority attempts to dismiss the controlling effect of<i>Webber</i> by two peremptory and unexplained asides: (1) that the <i>Webber</i> panel \"appears to assume arguendo\" that the tainted action of an underling communicated to a pure-minded supervisor may be the basis for liability, and (2) that the Court <i>found</i> that the superior \"had determined to terminate the employee on legitimate grounds <i>before</i> any contact with the supervisor [occurred] and that the supervisor had no causal influence on the firing.\" <i>Maj. op.</i> at 102 (emphasis in original).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Both of these observations strike me as irrelevancies in understanding the <i>Webber</i> opinion, and they perpetuate the majority's unwillingness to recognize the direct and focused thrust of the holding in <i>Mt. Healthy</i> (<i>e.g.</i> that a pure-minded final decision-maker is, in effect, an efficient intervening cause destroying the existence of proximate cause between the adverse animus of others than the final decision-maker and the damage resulting from the employment decision).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The factual circumstances in <i>Webber</i> were that the underlings, Schaub and Moser, had made remarks that plaintiff claimed showed that they harbored discriminatory intent toward the plaintiff. There was no evidence that they ever told Oettinger, the final decision-maker, that plaintiff should be discharged in the RIF. The panel concluded that it would be, on the record, excessively speculative for a jury to conclude that \"Moser conceivably `influenced' the decision to fire [the plaintiff].\" <i>Id.</i> at 237. The record showed, the panel found, that Oettinger, the plaintiff's ultimate superior and final decision-maker, had decided for proper reasons, to discharge the plaintiff. He then went to the underlings, Schaub and Moser, to notify them of his initial decision, not to seek their opinion, but rather to ascertain if he, Oettinger, had missed \"any material termination-related facts.\" <i>Id.</i> Schaub and Moser simply acquiesced in the decision, apparently without comment. The plaintiff conceded that they did not communicate to Oettinger any discriminatory animus that they may, in fact, have harbored. <i>Id.</i> at 236. Oettinger implemented the decision to discharge plaintiff.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">What the panel \"assumed arguendo\" was clearly stated by the panel in the opinion.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">[W]e shall assume <i>arguendo</i> that, even in the absence of any ... direct, affirmative communication between Oettinger and Moser, a supervisor's silence (<i>viz.,</i> his discriminatory failure to utilize the veto power conferred upon him by his employer) could constitute sufficient \"participation\" or \"influence\" to warrant imputing [the supervisor's] purported animus to [the final decision-maker].</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 237. This appears to me to be an appropriate understanding of the law under <i>Mt. Healthy.</i></p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">However, that understanding does not have the effect on the application of <i>Webber</i> here that the majority attribute to it. The operative finding of the panel in <i>Webber</i> was not that Oettinger made the discharge decision <i>before</i> consulting with Schaub and Moser <i>but</i> rather that he made it without any influence from them, and it is easily argued from the panel's language that the panel <i>assumed</i> that had there been any evidence that the underlings had a bad animus toward plaintiff, the failure to exercise in favor of plaintiff the implicit \"veto power\" Oettinger gave them by consulting with them would have been a sufficient causative \"influence\" upon the final decision-maker for <i>Mt. Healthy</i> purposes to result in a triable issue of proximate cause. That is the controlling factual underpinning for the decision that the case should not have gone to the jury because of the total absence of any evidence of causation. That is, in both respects, a correct application of the holding in <i>Mt. Healthy.</i> The state of mind of the underlings is irrelevant once it is established, as the panel in <i>Webber</i> found it to be, that that state of mind had no influence on the decision-maker. In such a scenario it is also irrelevant when, in the course of events, the final decision-maker reached his final decision.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

The underlying events are easily described; the complications arise out of governing legal doctrine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1987, Tejada began working as a law enforcement agent in the Special Investigations Bureau (\"the bureau\") of the PRJD. After other stints, Tejada was assigned in 1995 to the bureau's organized crime division, where he operated undercover, infiltrating Dominican drug trafficking rings. According to Tejada's later testimony, he came to be troubled by certain \"irregularities\": drug busts called off on the eve of arrest, without explanation; misuse of funds by another agent; and shady dealings by a government informant named Ivan Merced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tejada reported these concerns to Antonio Franco (his supervisor) and to the two higher officials later held liable to Tejada in this case: Domingo Alvarez (division head) and Lydia Morales (bureau director). No action was taken in response to his complaints. Worse still, a trafficker named Hernandez told Tejada that Merced had disclosed to gang members Tejada's identity as an undercover officer. When Tejada so advised Franco, Franco threatened to discipline Tejada for speaking to Hernandez without authorization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, a hit man whom Tejada had helped put in prison was released and, Tejada believed, began to search for Tejada. Fearing for his family's safety and his own, Tejada asked Franco for a transfer out of his division. Tejada then wrote to Morales, setting forth his complaints about Merced, the threat the latter posed to investigations, and the threat posed by the hit man.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales responded by transferring Tejada into what Tejada described as a dead-end job at bureau headquarters, one that often left him without any work to do. After receiving a number of threatening phone calls at his home, Tejada contacted Franco and Alvarez, who did not respond to his concerns. In May 1996, Tejada was activated for National Guard duty; Morales accused him of abusing military leave and withheld his pay. Eventually, in January 1997, Tejada moved his family to Florida at his own expense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 1996, Tejada, while still on leave, spoke with a reporter for the <i>El Vocero</i> newspaper; on December 10, a short article appeared, entitled \"S.I.B. Director and Assistant Denied Agent Transfer Although His Life Was in Danger.\" The next day, another appeared with the title, \"Domingo Alvarez of the S.I.B. Forbids Arrest in Drug Transactions.\" The articles touched on the problems Tejada had complained of internally; each cited Tejada as a source.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first short article, in substance, reported that Morales and Alvarez failed to protect Tejada despite threats on his life; that when he was transferred, it was only to an \"inoperative section\"; that Alvarez quashed another agent's complaint by threatening a transfer like Tejada's; and that Tejada had no regular car to use while at his new job, since the bureau prohibited agents from using their private cars and claimed that there were insufficient cars available.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second article alleged that Alvarez once suddenly and without explanation cancelled an imminent drug bust. It also said that a certain \"Ivan Rodriguez\"&#8212;a disguised name for the informant Ivan Merced&#8212;had blown Tejada's cover, \"ruined\" expensive investigations, was \"negotiating drug transactions\" without authorization from the bureau, and \"was working for the Bureau and for the underworld.\" It described one investigation involving Merced as follows (in translation):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Tejada] alleges that the confidant ruined an investigation in which a 50 kilos (which is valued at about $250,000) transaction was going to be made and \"which was going great and overnight it was ruined.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the day the second article appeared, Alvarez sent Morales a memorandum recommending Tejada's discharge on the basis of his leaks, saying that they endangered both an investigation that was \"still open\" and the life of the informant. The next day, Alvarez wrote another memorandum to Morales, again recommending discharge&#8212;this time prompted (supposedly) by an anonymous tip saying that Tejada had, in 1993, been convicted of domestic abuse. Whether Alvarez had earlier known of the conviction was disputed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 1993 conviction, which occurred while Tejada was on military leave, resulted from Tejada's hitting his wife, but it had been formally expunged by court order when Tejada completed a rehabilitation or \"diversion\" program. Alvarez's memorandum to Morales mentions the diversion program, but not that its completion entailed erasure of Tejada's conviction (even though he later testified that he knew diversion entailed expungement).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales, who was stepping down as bureau director, passed both of Alvarez's memoranda&#8212;one about the leaks, the other about the past conviction&#8212;to the incoming acting director (Morales's own former deputy), Miguel Gierbolini. On February 4, 1997, Gierbolini recommended to the newly appointed Secretary of Justice, Jos&#233; Fuentes Agostini, that Tejada be discharged for the 1993 domestic violence conviction on the ground that someone with this record should not be a police agent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fuentes signed Tejada's termination papers on February 27, 1997; Tejada, still on military leave, learned of this in early March, and an informal agency hearing was held on November 17, 1997. The hearing officer recommended discharge because the conduct leading to Tejada's conviction represented, in violation of the bureau's regulations, \"improper behavior or [behavior] damaging to the good name of the agency or the Government of Puerto Rico\" and \"commission of acts for which is charged or may be charged a felony or misdemeanor crime.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tejada brought suit in federal district court, seeking damages and injunctive relief under section 1983, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 (2000), for violation of his First Amendment rights. Named as defendants were Fuentes, Morales, Alvarez, Gierbolini, Franco, two other supervisors named Cristobal Irrizary and Ernesto Fern&#225;ndez, and an unnamed PRJD employee. Defense motions for summary judgment based on qualified immunity were denied, but the court eventually dismissed the claims against Fuentes, Fern&#225;ndez, and Irrizary for lack of evidence to support liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In dismissing the claim against Fuentes, the judge said that the evidence was insufficient as to motive, as it \"point[ed] to\" a \"very valid, nondiscriminatory reason.\" He later explained in a written opinion:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in the plaintiff's evidence established that [Secretary] Fuentes Agostini's motivation for signing the termination letter was in any way related to the publication of the newspaper articles or plaintiff's denouncement of corruption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, the evidence showed that Fuentes had merely \"signed the termination letter adopting a recommendation\" based on Tejada's prior conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the remaining defendants, the judge wrote that \"[t]here is sufficient evidence ... from which a reasonable trier of fact could find in favor of plaintiff.\" He noted Tejada's internal complaints of corruption, appellants' inaction, the timing of Alvarez's memoranda, the possibility that Alvarez had long known of the conviction, and Morales' role in forwarding the memoranda to Gierbolini. In other words, the judge thought that their motive could be deemed retaliatory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 27, 2003, after a four-day trial, the jury returned a verdict against Morales and Alvarez, assessing damages of $125,000 for Tejada's lost income. The district court denied post-trial motions for judgment in favor of the defendants, a new trial, and remittitur. Morales and Alvarez now appeal, contesting both the verdict against them and the amount of damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appeal implicates several different bodies of court-created law, beginning with the cause of action itself. Although the section 1983 cause of action is statutory, the substance of the claim here derives from Supreme Court precedents construing the First Amendment. In a nutshell, the <i>Pickering/Connick</i> line of decisions forbids officials from firing an employee for \"protected speech\" unless under a balancing test the governmental interests outweigh the need for protection.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The claim thus turns in the first instance on the nature of the speech, the balancing of interests, and the motivation for the firing. In this instance, the defendants concede for purposes of this appeal that Tejada's \"speech\"&#8212;his disclosures to the reporter&#8212;was at least in part protected speech under the governing case law. The disclosures, indeed, involved alleged serious mismanagement and possible corruption in the bureau, <i>see Guilloty Perez v. Pierluisi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200592\"><a href=\"/opinion/200592/guilloty-perez-v-fuentes-agostini/\"><span class=\"volume\">339</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, 52-53 (1st Cir.2003), and they occurred only after Tejada had properly sought relief through internal complaints, <i>cf. Wagner v. City of Holyoke,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201532\"><a href=\"/opinion/201532/wagner-v-city-of-holyoke/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">504</span></a></span>, 508 (1st Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"balancing\"&#8212;ordinarily a question of law for the court&#8212;is a much closer question. The defendants argue that Tejada potentially endangered the life of an informant (Ivan) and could have jeopardized ongoing investigations. This solicitude may appear to contrast with defendants' own limited interest in Tejada's safety. Furthermore, only Ivan's first name was revealed, and Ivan was himself in jail (for unauthorized drug dealing while acting as an informant) by the time of the newspaper reports.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, had Tejada been fired <i>because</i> he revealed information jeopardizing an informant and an ongoing investigation, defendants would have an excellent argument that Tejada was fired for unprotected speech. <i>See United States v. Chagra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"415224\"><a href=\"/opinion/415224/united-states-v-joseph-salim-chagra-v-san-antonio-light-division-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">701</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">354</span></a></span>, 365 (5th Cir.1983). However, so far as Morales and Alvarez were responsible for the firing&#8212;a separate question to which we will return&#8212;the jury could on the evidence before it conclude that their motives were not based on these concerns about Ivan and the investigation, but that they acted because of Tejada's protected speech.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tejada's main disclosures were of mismanagement and possible corruption; hostility to him had been demonstrated because of his internal complaints well before his newspaper disclosures; and the addition of the domestic violence charge could have been viewed as a gratuitous gesture undermining the claim by appellants that they were centrally concerned with the threat to Ivan or ongoing investigations. In short, the jury could have concluded that the appellants acted <i>because</i> of Tejada's protected speech.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The focus of the appellants' brief, so far as liability is concerned, is on a multi-step claim: that Fuentes, not the appellants, fired Tejada; that Fuentes did so on an entirely different ground unconnected with protected speech; and that these circumstances insulate the appellants from liability under the so-called <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense, which arises where the firing would have occurred even without the protected speech. <i>See Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109574\"><a href=\"/opinion/109574/mt-healthy-city-bd-of-ed-v-doyle/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span>, 287, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109574\"><a href=\"/opinion/109574/mt-healthy-city-bd-of-ed-v-doyle/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">568</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109574\"><a href=\"/opinion/109574/mt-healthy-city-bd-of-ed-v-doyle/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">471</span></a></span> (1977).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To start with the factual premises, we agree that Fuentes purported to discharge Tejada because of the domestic violence conviction, and for the present appeal we accept that this was indeed Fuentes's ground. This is <i>not</i> because the district court's ruling to this effect binds us, as appellants assert, but because there is no direct evidence that Fuentes acted on any other ground.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> A circumstantial case to the contrary might be attempted (based on implausibility), but it would not be easy and Tejada does not attempt such an attack on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Strictly speaking, <i>Mt. Healthy</i> is not on point here. It deals with actions taken by an official or agency out of \"mixed motives.\" It says, in substance, that where there was a permissible and impermissible ground for a firing, the impermissible ground should be ignored where the employee would have been discharged anyway based on the permissible motive. Although clear policy considerations are invoked, the main rationale is that in such a case the impermissible ground was not a but-for cause of the firing; it would have happened anyway. 429 U.S. at 285-87, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109574\"><a href=\"/opinion/109574/mt-healthy-city-bd-of-ed-v-doyle/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">568</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, <i>Mt. Healthy</i> comports with the traditional tort-law principle that if the wrongful act did not <i>cause</i> the injury, the wrongdoer is not liable. <i>See Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts,</i> &#167; 41 at 263 (5th ed.1984). By contrast, in this case, the actions of the appellants <i>were</i> a \"but-for\" cause of Tejada's firing. The jury could easily have concluded that Tejada would not have been fired if appellants had not disclosed Tejada's prior conviction and passed along the recommendation to Fuentes. The appellants' actions were also surely a \"proximate cause\" as well, in the sense that the result was foreseeable (indeed, desired).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So the problem in this case is not one of a single actor with multiple motives, but of sequential actors having different motives&#8212;the first actor's motive being unlawful and the second actor's motive at least permissible. In such a case, the first actor may be (and here was) a but-for cause of the firing. The question is whether the intervening step&#8212;a final decision maker acting on a permissible ground&#8212;should as a matter of policy (not lack of causation) insulate the wrongdoer from liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have found only a few circuits that have addressed this sequence-of-actors issue in the present context, and they are nominally in conflict. The Fifth Circuit says that the final action by the properly motived superior insulates the ill-motivated subordinate, <i>Beattie v. Madison County Sch. Dist.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"24446\"><a href=\"/opinion/24446/beattie-v-madison-cty-sch-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">254</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">595</span></a></span>, 603-05 (5th Cir.2001); three other circuits say that the subordinate remains liable if he is a but-for cause of the firing, <i>Gilbrook v.

Whether any of these cases intends a wholly mechanical rule in all cases is open to doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our own recent decision in <i>Webber v.

Ultimately, the court did not decide the issue; it found that (unlike the present case) the superior had determined to terminate the employee on legitimate grounds <i>before</i> any contact with the supervisor and that the supervisor had no causal influence on the firing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any case, a rigid rule would not comport with sound policy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Suppose that the appellants had disclosed that Tejada was taking payoffs from the mob and Fuentes had discharged Tejada on that basis; it is hard to imagine any court upholding damages to Tejada for the firing, even if appellants' motives were unlawful. Conversely, suppose in retaliation for protected speech the appellants misled Fuentes into thinking that Tejada had shirked his duties; surely they should be held liable even if Fuentes's own motives were innocent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our case falls between such extremes. Even accepting that Fuentes' own motive was \"pure,\" a jury could reasonably doubt that the firing would have occurred if Fuentes had stumbled across the prior conviction on his own. Appellants cite authority under Puerto Rico law for discharging a police officer for domestic abuse. But here Tejada's conviction was over three years old, and the conviction had been expunged under local law after he had received counseling. It is highly unlikely that absent the appellants' prompting, the firing was inevitable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor was Tejada's misconduct of such a kind that would make it unthinkable to retain him as a policeman after its disclosure, as would be the case if he was guilty of mob ties or murder. His misconduct was serious, to be sure; but it was one incident, well in the past, and Tejada had been rehabilitated. This is not a case in which it offends public policy to sanction a defendant who, for improper reasons, revealed Tejada's earlier offense in order to prompt his discharge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants make a final merits-related claim of qualified immunity. The interplay between qualified immunity and First Amendment violations is a difficult subject, partly because the former normally employs an objective standard and the latter&#8212;in contrast to the ordinary Fourth Amendment claim&#8212;turns heavily upon motive. This does not mean that qualified immunity can never succeed in a First Amendment case, <i>see Dirrane v. Brookline Police Dept.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200266\"><a href=\"/opinion/200266/dirrane-v-brookline-police/\"><span class=\"volume\">315</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span></a></span>, 69-71 (1st Cir.2002), but only that the opportunities may be narrowed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, appellants' brief describes qualified immunity doctrine in general terms but makes no effort to apply it to the facts of this case. An argument not seriously developed in the opening brief is forfeit, <i>see United States v. Zannino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1990), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1082</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The district court reaffirmed its factual findings and legal conclusions based on those findings in a post-trial Opinion and Order: The evidence also demonstrated that Fuentes Agostini signed plaintiff's termination letter on February 27, 1997, adopting the recommendation of Miguel Gierbolini that plaintiff be discharged for <i>his domestic violence conviction. Nothing in plaintiff's evidence established that Fuentes Agostini's motivation for signing the termination letter was in any way related to the publication of the newspaper articles or plaintiff's denouncement of corruption.</i> The evidence similarly fell short of establishing Fuentes Agostini's knowledge of plaintiff's protected expressions. Plaintiff nevertheless contends that a reasonable inference can be drawn from the evidence presented. He suggests that from the scanty evidence described above, a reasonable inference can be made that co-defendant Fuentes Agostini knew of the newspaper articles and was motivated by them. He further claims that it is reasonable to expect that a newly appointed Secretary of Justice will be informed of all the media publications that relate to the Department of Justice, and that when he signed the termination letter he must have been presented with plaintiff's file in which the memoranda containing plaintiff's expressions were addressed. All of these, plaintiff contends, creates a reasonable inference that Fuentes Agostini was motivated by the plaintiff's exercise of First Amendment rights at the time he signed the termination letter.

Even though the evidence <i>might</i> be construed to establish that <i>their</i> termination recommendations were potentially driven by some unconstitutional motivation, they cannot be liable under section 1983 without some evidence of causation between that motivation and the decision by Secretary Fuentes to discharge the Plaintiff. <i>See Beattie v.

Indeed, the district court specifically found that Secretary Fuentes made his own independent decision to terminate Mr. Tejada <i>based on Tejada's prior domestic violence conviction</i> and that there was no evidence upon which to impute any of Ms. Morales' and Mr. Alverez's motives to Secretary Fuentes. Without at least being able to impute appellants' unlawful motives to Secretary Fuentes, those wrongful motives cannot be found to be a <i>motivating</i> factor in the adverse employment action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hence, the conduct of the minions, Morales and Alvarez, that the majority imagines to be the \"but for\" cause of Plaintiff's discharge never, as a matter of law, had any legally cognizable influence or impact of any kind in bringing about <i>the decision</i> by Fuentes, as affirmed by the reviewing hearing officer, to discharge the Plaintiff. Any conclusion, even any inference, to the contrary is manifestly in conflict with the district court's conclusion at trial <i>as a matter of law</i> that Fuentes, the final decision-maker, acted without any improper knowledge or motivation. As a matter of law, there simply cannot be any causal link here between any supposed improper motives of the minions and the discharge implemented by Secretary Fuentes' solitary decision to discharge plaintiff for a proper, stated reason.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is precisely the purpose and role of the holding in <i>Mt. Healthy</i> to cut off such noncontributory conduct from serving as an efficient causal link to support recovery of damages where the Defendant puts forth a legitimate reason for the discharge. The United States Supreme Court had its own \"policy\" basis for casting that holding out into the world of legal precedent; it stated that policy to be its response to fairness considerations that may arise in the course of truly mixed motive cases. I believe that it is wrong for the majority to casually shunt aside a clearly applicable holding of the Supreme Court in reliance on its own previously unrecognized \"policy\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> of aversion to rigid rules of burden-of-proof allocation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the <i>Mt. Healthy</i> case, the challenged employment action in question consisted of facts that the superintendent of the Defendant school system recommended to the School Board at year-end that the Plaintiff, along with nine other teachers, not be rehired and the action of the School Board in accepting that recommendation. The Court expressly established \"a rule of causation,\" 429 U.S. at 285, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109574\"><a href=\"/opinion/109574/mt-healthy-city-bd-of-ed-v-doyle/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Accordingly, it held that the appropriate analytical inquiry, in terms of causation, should go beyond the question of whether constitutionally protected conduct was a \"motivating factor\" and that a determination should be made as to whether the Defendant would have taken the same employment action \"even in the absence of the protected conduct.\" <i>Id.</i> The failure of the court below to reach that second question was found to require reversal in <i>Mt.

There, the question was whether the motivations of the Plaintiff's immediate supervisors, Schaub and Moser, could be taken to be adequate circumstantial evidence that the final decision-maker, Oetinger, who testified that Schaub and Moser neither participated in nor contributed to the decision, acted from an improper motivation in taking the adverse employment action in question. The Court there stated, \"[t]he pivotal question thus becomes: whether the jury could rationally infer from these record facts that Moser [the underling] conceivably `influenced' the decision to fire [the plaintiff].\" <i>Id.</i> at 237. Concluding that the evidence would not support such an inference, the panel found that Plaintiff, \"failed to meet his burden of proof to show that <i>the proximate cause</i> of his termination was [defendant employer's] discriminatory animus.\" <i>Id.</i> at 240 (emphasis added). Thus, causation, not local circuit \"policy,\" was taken to drive the decision to affirm the district court's grant of Judgment as a Matter of Law to the Defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Webber</i> case is a clear application of the <i>Mt. Healthy</i> rule requiring the presence of causational linkage between the conduct of those who are found to harbor discriminatory motivation and the making of the actual, challenged employment decision. It is, I suggest, not proper for this panel to depart from this holding. In this Circuit, each panel of the Court is bound by prior panel decisions directly on point. <i>Jusino v. Zayas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524052\"><a href=\"/opinion/524052/waddie-jusino-v-carmen-sonia-zayas-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">875</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">986</span></a></span>, 993 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The seminal holding of <i>Webber,</i> for present purposes, is that where the evidence fails to show that the final decision-maker is influenced adversely by the motivation of lower level actors, the type and level of causation required by <i>Mt. Healthy</i> is absent <i>and must be recognized.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> A second echelon of \"but for\" causational conduct will not suffice to bridge the gap between liability and damage that is created by the absence of <i>motivated</i> causational conduct of the final decision-maker. This case is much stronger than <i>Webber</i> because here that absence is established in the record whereas in <i>Webber</i> the contrary was established by concession of the Plaintiff (assuming the record is to be given any weight in appellate consideration) as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I suggest this panel is properly bound by the holding of the <i>Webber</i> case since it has not been subsequently overruled and no other exceptional circumstances apply to call in question the viability of that prior ruling. <i>Mainegeneral Medical Ceter v. Shalala,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">205</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">493</span></span>, 497 (1st Cir.2000); <i>Williams v. Ashland Engineering Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195880\"><a href=\"/opinion/195880/williams-v-ashland-engineering/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">588</span></a></span>, 592 (1st Cir.1995). The <i>Webber</i> decision was recently rendered, on August 9, 2005, and there is no circumstance that postdates that decision, \"that offers a sound reason for believing that the former panel, in light of fresh developments, would change its collective mind.\" <i>Williams,</i> 45 F.3d at 592.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, I believe the judgment below should be reversed to comply with the applicable, direct holding of the United States Supreme Court in the <i>Mt. Healthy</i> case and the previously announced rule of decision in this Circuit under that precedent in the <i>Webber</i> case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The district court's findings on this point were not appealed are not called into question for review on this appeal. I also note that on appeal Mr. Tejada argues that under Puerto Rican law an employee cannot be terminated for a conviction of domestic violence when the employee has engaged as he did in a rehabilitation program. However, Mr. Tejada did not file a cross-appeal challenging the district court's decision to grant Judgment as a Matter of Law to Secretary Fuentes. Therefore, the Court cannot reconsider this issue on appeal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Secretary Fuentes entered office in January 1997, after the articles were published in El Vocero</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The majority states, \"The question is whether the intervening steps&#8212;a final decision-maker acting on a permissible ground&#8212;should<i>as a matter of policy</i> (not lack of causation) insulate the wrongdoer from liability.\" <i>Id.</i> at 12 (emphasis added).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">This formulation evades rational footing as <i>Mt. Healthy</i> establishes it to be the dominant <i>legal</i> policy that \"lack of causation\" does, in fact, insulate from liability one whose conduct is not a motivating factor for the wrongful employment action. The majority has substituted its own <i>policy</i> for the <i>holding</i> of the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> I believe that the majority's fundamental error here lies in its inability to accept and respect the fact that a seminal mistake was made by the district court at trial when it made the ruling insulating Secretary Fuentes from liability on the causation analysis of<i>Mt. Healthy</i> and then failed to recognize that its ruling also should have necessarily insulated Morales and Alvarez from liability. If it be correct that Fuentes is not liable because there is no causal link between his discharge action and the purportedly improper motivations of the minions, then it <i>must also be</i> that the minions are not liable because there is no causal link between their supposed motivations and the damage caused by the proper discharge by Fuentes.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Hence, once the district court made its ruling in favor of Fuentes, it should have also granted judgment in favor of Morales and Alvarez on the basis of that ruling. It was legally wrong to submit the case to the jury as to them because there was no evidentiary predicate, on the court's own finding, on which causation could be sustained.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">I believe that it is not proper, as the majority would do, simply to ignore the fact that there is no rational basis in the record for these Defendants' liability. It is not right or reasonable to ignore the occurrence of and the legal significance of the error and to bless a judgment that is patently without any foundation in the law. A simple recognition of the force and effect of the error in assessing these Defendants' liability (<i>e.g.,</i> that the judgment imposes liability without causation) will yield a legally sustainable result and respect the rights of these Defendants and the Agency to be insulated from liability because the Agency's final decision-maker acted properly.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The majority attempts to dismiss the controlling effect of<i>Webber</i> by two peremptory and unexplained asides: (1) that the <i>Webber</i> panel \"appears to assume arguendo\" that the tainted action of an underling communicated to a pure-minded supervisor may be the basis for liability, and (2) that the Court <i>found</i> that the superior \"had determined to terminate the employee on legitimate grounds <i>before</i> any contact with the supervisor [occurred] and that the supervisor had no causal influence on the firing.\" <i>Maj. op.</i> at 102 (emphasis in original).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Both of these observations strike me as irrelevancies in understanding the <i>Webber</i> opinion, and they perpetuate the majority's unwillingness to recognize the direct and focused thrust of the holding in <i>Mt. Healthy</i> (<i>e.g.</i> that a pure-minded final decision-maker is, in effect, an efficient intervening cause destroying the existence of proximate cause between the adverse animus of others than the final decision-maker and the damage resulting from the employment decision).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The factual circumstances in <i>Webber</i> were that the underlings, Schaub and Moser, had made remarks that plaintiff claimed showed that they harbored discriminatory intent toward the plaintiff. There was no evidence that they ever told Oettinger, the final decision-maker, that plaintiff should be discharged in the RIF. The panel concluded that it would be, on the record, excessively speculative for a jury to conclude that \"Moser conceivably `influenced' the decision to fire [the plaintiff].\" <i>Id.</i> at 237. The record showed, the panel found, that Oettinger, the plaintiff's ultimate superior and final decision-maker, had decided for proper reasons, to discharge the plaintiff. He then went to the underlings, Schaub and Moser, to notify them of his initial decision, not to seek their opinion, but rather to ascertain if he, Oettinger, had missed \"any material termination-related facts.\" <i>Id.</i> Schaub and Moser simply acquiesced in the decision, apparently without comment. The plaintiff conceded that they did not communicate to Oettinger any discriminatory animus that they may, in fact, have harbored. <i>Id.</i> at 236. Oettinger implemented the decision to discharge plaintiff.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">What the panel \"assumed arguendo\" was clearly stated by the panel in the opinion.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">[W]e shall assume <i>arguendo</i> that, even in the absence of any ... direct, affirmative communication between Oettinger and Moser, a supervisor's silence (<i>viz.,</i> his discriminatory failure to utilize the veto power conferred upon him by his employer) could constitute sufficient \"participation\" or \"influence\" to warrant imputing [the supervisor's] purported animus to [the final decision-maker].</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 237. This appears to me to be an appropriate understanding of the law under <i>Mt. Healthy.</i></p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">However, that understanding does not have the effect on the application of <i>Webber</i> here that the majority attribute to it. The operative finding of the panel in <i>Webber</i> was not that Oettinger made the discharge decision <i>before</i> consulting with Schaub and Moser <i>but</i> rather that he made it without any influence from them, and it is easily argued from the panel's language that the panel <i>assumed</i> that had there been any evidence that the underlings had a bad animus toward plaintiff, the failure to exercise in favor of plaintiff the implicit \"veto power\" Oettinger gave them by consulting with them would have been a sufficient causative \"influence\" upon the final decision-maker for <i>Mt. Healthy</i> purposes to result in a triable issue of proximate cause. That is the controlling factual underpinning for the decision that the case should not have gone to the jury because of the total absence of any evidence of causation. That is, in both respects, a correct application of the holding in <i>Mt. Healthy.</i> The state of mind of the underlings is irrelevant once it is established, as the panel in <i>Webber</i> found it to be, that that state of mind had no influence on the decision-maker. In such a scenario it is also irrelevant when, in the course of events, the final decision-maker reached his final decision.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
