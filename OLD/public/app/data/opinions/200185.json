Lagueux, Senior U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                      Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n                  Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                   and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Christopher M.

McKelvey, Cetrulo &\nCapone, LLP, James R. DeGiacomo, and Murtha Cullina Roche &\nDeGiacomo were on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n\n                        October 30, 2002\n\f                SELYA,    Circuit    Judge.      A    discharge       in    bankruptcy,\n\nsimpliciter, ordinarily does not wipe out previously perfected\n\nsecurity interests in tangible personal property.                      The lienholder\n\nretains     a     right    of   repossession,        subject,    however,      to   the\n\nbankrupt's possible right of redemption. If timely exercised, this\n\nright of redemption allows an individual Chapter 7 debtor to\n\n\"redeem [certain] tangible personal property intended primarily for\n\npersonal,       family,    or   household     use,    from   a       lien   securing   a\n\ndischargeable consumer debt\" by paying the lienholder a sum equal\n\nto \"the amount of the allowed secured claim.\"                        11 U.S.C. § 722\n\n(2000).\n\n                The cases that undergird this appeal present something of\n\nan anomaly.         They involve a preserved security interest but no\n\nsecured claim per se.           Thus, they involve a right of repossession,\n\nand the parties, by instruments that they refer to as \"redemption\n\nagreements\" — we shall honor that characterization even though,\n\ntechnically, this may not be the type of redemption agreement that\n\nsection 722 contemplates — have agreed to cancel that right of\n\nrepossession on payment of an \"agreed value\" for the collateral.\n\nThat value is not in issue; as we shall see, the parties agreed to\n\nspecific dollar figures, and they are bound by those agreements.\n\nWhat   is   in     issue    are     particular   aspects        of    the    negotiated\n\ntransactions.\n\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\f          To be specific, the appellants — several former Chapter\n\n7 debtors seeking to represent a putative class — maintain that the\n\nprincipal defendant, Sears, Roebuck & Company,1 habitually violated\n\nthe Bankruptcy Code by the manner in which it essayed to enforce\n\nsecurity liens in household goods and other personal property.\n\nTheir claim has two subparts.         First, they allege that redemption\n\nagreements between lienholders and debtors, entered into after the\n\ngranting of a discharge in bankruptcy, invariably violate the\n\nprohibitions of the bankruptcy discharge injunction, codified in 11\n\nU.S.C. § 524.        Second, they allege that, in all events, such\n\nagreements require bankruptcy court approval (which was never\n\nobtained).\n\n          In addition to these bankruptcy-related asseverations,\n\nthe appellants also advance a claim under the Fair Debt Collection\n\nPractices Act (FDCPA), 15 U.S.C. §§ 1692-1692o (2000).          This claim\n\n— that the individual defendants (lawyers representing Sears)\n\ntransgressed   the    FDCPA   while   supposedly   attempting   to   effect\n\nrepossession — requires a determination of whether the FDCPA\n\nreaches the defendants' activities.        That, in turn, requires us to\n\nconsider the nature of a \"debt\" as that term is employed in the\n\nFDCPA.\n\n\n\n     1\n      Sears National Bank (which financed many of the appellants'\npurchases) is also named as a defendant. Because its presence adds\nnothing to the explication of the issues on appeal, we refer to the\ntwo corporations, collectively, as \"Sears.\"\n\n                                      3\n\f             The district court wrote a thoughtful opinion in which it\n\nanswered both the bankruptcy and the FDCPA questions adversely to\n\nthe appellants.      Arruda v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 273 B.R. 332\n\n(D.R.I. 2002).      It thereupon dismissed their complaints.          Id. at\n\n351.     For the reasons that follow, we affirm the district court's\n\norder.\n\nI.     BACKGROUND\n\n             The district court has furnished an exegetic account of\n\neach appellant's situation and the litigation's procedural history.\n\nSee id. at 340-42.       Rather than repastinate that well-plowed soil,\n\nwe present here only the background facts necessary to frame the\n\nissues on appeal.     Because the district court acted under Fed. R.\n\nCiv.    P.   12(b)(6),    we   derive   these   facts   from    the   several\n\ncomplaints, purged, however, of empty rhetoric.                See SEC v. SG\n\nLtd., 265 F.3d 42, 44 (1st Cir. 2001); Aulson v. Blanchard, 83 F.3d\n\n1, 3 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n             The appellants are Rhode Island residents, all of whom\n\nhad filed for personal bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy\n\nCode, 11 U.S.C. §§ 701-784 (2000).          Each had purchased consumer\n\ngoods from Sears (e.g., refrigerators, sewing machines) prior to\n\nfiling for bankruptcy.         On the filing date, each owed money to\n\nSears for the purchases and each listed the Sears debt as an\n\nunsecured, nonpriority claim on his/her bankruptcy schedules.             The\n\n\n\n\n                                        4\n\fbankruptcy    court    granted     each       appellant    a    general      discharge\n\nencompassing the Sears indebtedness.\n\n             Of   course,   the    discharges        did       not   erase    Sears's\n\nprepetition security interest in the purchased property.                       See id.\n\n§ 522(c) and (f); see also In re Brown, 73 B.R. 740, 745 (Bankr.\n\nW.D. Wis. 1987) (discussing how section 522 operates in connection\n\nwith   purchase    money    security      interests       in    household      goods).\n\nRelying on this fact, Sears thereafter asserted its rights of\n\nrepossession. Its correspondence with the appellant Dorothy Arruda\n\nwas typical.      Sears's letter asked Arruda to contact its office to\n\narrange for turning over the collateral (in her case, a range hood,\n\na lawn mower, and a sewing machine).               Arruda no longer possessed\n\ntwo of the three items in which Sears claimed an interest.                        When\n\nshe called to discuss the situation, she was told by a Sears\n\nrepresentative that she could either surrender the goods or redeem\n\nthem by paying their fair market value as determined by Sears.\n\n             Two other appellants, Melanie Velleco and Blanche Sroka,\n\nhad similar experiences.          In each instance, lawyers representing\n\nSears insisted that the discharged debtor either surrender the\n\naffected property voluntarily, state an intention to redeem it, or\n\nforfeit it through state replevin proceedings in which \"the Sheriff\n\n[would] go out with [a Sears representative] to take possession of\n\nthe items in question.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\f          Sears's      interaction      with   the     appellants        Vincent   and\n\nKathleen Kowal was along the same lines.                The Kowals allege that\n\nvarious individuals representing Sears sent them letters offering\n\nto allow them to retain the articles that were the subject of the\n\nreplevin action (a bicycle, a gas range, a sofa, and some exercise\n\nequipment) in exchange for a payment equaling the merchandise's\n\nfair market value.        These letters indicated that the Kowals had\n\n\"requested payment terms to settle Sears' claim of repossession\"\n\nand that \"Sears will settle the claim[s] for a lump sum payment\"\n\n(totaling $1,165.37 for the four items) that \"Sears believe[d] . .\n\n. represent[ed] the fair market value of the items.\"\n\n          In    every     case,   the       appellants     eventually       received\n\ndocuments which, for present purposes, were materially identical to\n\nthe memorandum of redemption received by Velleco and reproduced in\n\nthe appendix. Arruda, Velleco, and Sroka each signed the proffered\n\nredemption    agreement    and    returned      it    to   Sears    with    a   check\n\nreflecting the \"agreed value\" specified therein. The Kowals signed\n\na similar redemption agreement for the sofa and gas range, paying\n\nthe amount established by Sears for those items.                     They did not\n\nattempt to redeem either the bicycle or the exercise equipment, and\n\nSears subsequently repossessed those articles.\n\n             Without    exception,      Sears        asserted      its     right    of\n\nrepossession only after an appellant's bankruptcy proceedings were\n\ncompleted. Once a discharged debtor signed a redemption agreement,\n\n\n                                        6\n\fSears notified his/her attorney that it was unable to file the\n\nagreement because the bankruptcy case was closed. See generally 11\n\nU.S.C. § 501 (permitting, but not requiring, secured creditor to\n\nfile a proof of claim or interest during the pendency of bankruptcy\n\nproceedings).       It stated, however, that it nonetheless intended to\n\nhonor the agreement.\n\n                The appellants allege that the amounts Sears required in\n\norder      to   release    its    security       liens   on    the        goods   bore   no\n\ncorrelation to actual market values (and, in fact, exceeded market\n\nvalue). The appellants also allege that the cost of replevying the\n\ngoods outweighed any residual value that Sears realistically could\n\nhave    hoped      to   realize    from      a    resale      of    the     merchandise.\n\nConspicuously absent are allegations that the redemption values\n\nwere in any way linked to the amount of the debt owed with respect\n\nto the purchase of the goods.\n\n                Against this backdrop, the appellants portray Sears's\n\nactivities as part of an illicit scheme:                     they envision Sears as\n\nlying in wait until a debtor's bankruptcy case is closed and then\n\n—   with    the    Bankruptcy     Court's        attention    focused        elsewhere    —\n\ncontacting the debtor and threatening to repossess useful household\n\ngoods unless the debtor enters into a high-priced redemption\n\nagreement.          This   scheme,    the        appellants        say,    violates      the\n\nbankruptcy discharge injunction, 11 U.S.C. § 524, as an attempt to\n\ncollect discharged debt without judicial approval of either the\n\n\n                                          7\n\fredemption agreements or the valuations assigned to individual\n\nitems of collateral.        The Kowals add two further arguments:      that\n\nSears's use of inaccurate valuation tables and other scurrilous\n\ntactics constitute fraud and false pretenses, and that the debt\n\ncollectors' actions violate the FDCPA.\n\n           Treating the several cases as an integrated whole, the\n\ndistrict court dismissed the complaints insofar as they purported\n\nto allege federal claims.       As to the bankruptcy issues, the court\n\nruled that Sears's efforts anent repossession (and the ensuing\n\nredemption agreements) did not offend the Bankruptcy Code. Arruda,\n\n273 B.R. at 348.     As to the remaining federal issue, the court held\n\nthat the FDCPA did not apply to the challenged activities.           Id. at\n\n349-51.   Finally,    the    court   declined    to   retain   supplemental\n\njurisdiction over the appellants' state-law claims, dismissing them\n\nwithout prejudice.     Id. at 351 (citing      28 U.S.C. § 1367(a)).   This\n\nappeal followed.\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n           We review a district court's dismissal of an action for\n\nfailure to state a claim de novo.         Garrett v. Tandy Corp., 295 F.3d\n\n94, 97 (1st Cir. 2002).       In so doing, we follow the same rules that\n\nbound the district court. Consequently, we assume the truth of all\n\nwell-pleaded facts and indulge all reasonable inferences therefrom\n\nthat fit the plaintiff's stated theory of liability.              Rogan v.\n\nMenino, 175 F.3d 75, 77 (1st Cir. 1999).         In that process, we give\n\n\n                                      8\n\fno weight to \"bald assertions, unsupportable conclusions, and\n\nopprobrious epithets.\" Chongris v. Bd. of Appeals, 811 F.2d 36, 37\n\n(1st Cir. 1987) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nWithin these guidelines, we will affirm a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal\n\nonly if \"the factual averments do not justify recovery on some\n\ntheory adumbrated in the complaint.\"        Rogan, 175 F.3d at 77.\n\n          Two special principles are also relevant here.           For one\n\nthing, the appellants attached various documents, including the\n\nmemoranda of redemption, to their complaints.          When a complaint\n\nannexes and incorporates by reference a written instrument, any\n\ninconsistencies between the complaint and the instrument must be\n\nresolved in favor of the latter.        See Clorox Co. P.R. v. Proctor &\n\nGamble Commercial Co., 228 F.3d 24, 32 (1st Cir. 2000); see also\n\nYoung v. Lepone, ___ F.3d ___, ___ (1st Cir. 2002) [No. 01-2622,\n\nslip op. at 17-18].     For another thing, the Civil Rules require\n\nfraud to be pleaded with particularity.          Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b).\n\nThis requirement \"entails specifying in the pleader's complaint the\n\ntime, place,   and   content   of   the   alleged   false   or   fraudulent\n\nrepresentations.\" Powers v. Boston Cooper Corp., 926 F.2d 109, 111\n\n(1st Cir. 1991).\n\n          With this framework in place, we turn to the appellants'\n\nassignments of error.\n\n\n\n\n                                    9\n\f                 A.   The Bankruptcy Discharge Injunction.\n\n             The most pervasive issue in this case hinges on the scope\n\nand operation of the bankruptcy discharge injunction, 11 U.S.C. §\n\n524.     This is a matter of statutory construction, and we approach\n\nit by examining the language of the pertinent statutes.              United\n\nStates v. Charles George Trucking Co., 823 F.2d 685, 688 (1st Cir.\n\n1987).     In determining the meaning of a statute, we presume that\n\nCongress intended all of the constituent words and passages to have\n\nmeaning and effect.        Lopez-Soto v. Hawayek, 175 F.3d 170, 173 (1st\n\nCir. 1999).        Concomitantly, we \"defer to Congress's choice of\n\nphrase and give words used in a statute their ordinary and accepted\n\nmeaning.\"       C.K. Smith & Co. v. Motiva Enters. LLC, 269 F.3d 70, 76\n\n(1st Cir. 2001).\n\n            Section 524(c) deals specifically with agreements between\n\ndebtors and those who hold claims against them.               It states in\n\npertinent part:\n\n             An agreement between a holder of a claim and\n             the debtor, the consideration for which, in\n             whole or in part, is based on a debt that is\n             dischargeable in a case under this title is\n             enforceable only to any extent enforceable\n             under applicable nonbankruptcy law . . . [and]\n             only if [certain elements not relevant here\n             are satisfied].\n\n11 U.S.C. § 524(c).         For present purposes, then, the threshold\n\ninquiry    is    whether   the   consideration   underlying   a   particular\n\nredemption agreement is based to any degree on a debt that is\n\ndischargeable (or that has been discharged) in bankruptcy.              This\n\n                                      10\n\finquiry involves two different bodies of law: the dischargeability\n\nof a debt is a matter of federal bankruptcy law, but whether the\n\nconsideration for the underlying agreement is based on that debt is\n\na matter of state contract law.\n\n          We start with the federal question.               Although the terms\n\n\"discharge\" and \"dischargeable\" are not explicitly defined in the\n\nBankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. § 524(a) sheds considerable light upon\n\nthe matter.     It states that a \"discharge . . . voids any judgment\n\n. . . to the extent that [it] is a determination of the personal\n\nliability of the debtor . . . [and enjoins] the commencement or\n\ncontinuation of an action, the employment of process, or any act,\n\nto collect, recover or offset any such debt as a personal liability\n\nof the debtor . . . .\"       Id. § 524(a)(1)-(2) (emphasis supplied).\n\nThus, only a debtor's personal liability is dischargeable in a\n\nChapter 7 case.       It follows, therefore, that the strictures of\n\nsection 524(c) apply only to those agreements the consideration for\n\nwhich   involves,     in   whole   or        in   part,   the   imposition   (or\n\nreimposition)    of   personal     liability       with   respect   to   a   debt\n\ndischargeable (or previously discharged) in bankruptcy.\n\n          This brings us to the second phase of our inquiry. Here,\n\nthe relevant state law is the law of Rhode Island.                  Under Rhode\n\nIsland law, \"[u]nambiguous language is to be accorded its plain and\n\nnatural meaning.\"     Newport Plaza Assocs. v. Durfee Attleboro Bank,\n\n985 F.2d 640, 645 (1st Cir. 1993).                The interpretation of such\n\n\n                                        11\n\flanguage presents a question of law.                   Id. at 644 (citing Judd\n\nRealty, Inc. v. Tedesco, 400 A.2d 952, 955 (R.I. 1979)).                 And when\n\nintent is plainly revealed by the express terms of a written\n\ncontract,    an    inquiring     court        should    not   search   for   \"some\n\nundisclosed intent . . . but [rather, look to that intent] . . .\n\nexpressed by the language contained in the contract.\"                        Woon.\n\nTeachers' Guild, Local 951 v. School Comm., 367 A.2d 203, 205 (R.I.\n\n1976).\n\n            Each redemption agreement at issue here contains an\n\nexplicit acknowledgment that \"the Debtor's failure to redeem as\n\ndescribed within this agreement shall not impose any personal\n\nliability on the Debtor.\"        Each agreement adds that \"if the debtor\n\nfails to pay the redemption amount, Sears' only recourse is against\n\nthe collateral.\"     This language appears just above the agreement's\n\nsignature   line    and   just   below    the     underscored    heading:      \"No\n\nPersonal Liability.\"      The appellants do not allege that they were\n\nunaware of this language; indeed, their complaints confirm that\n\nthey consented to this very formulation.                 Given these facts, the\n\nagreements cannot plausibly be interpreted to impose personal\n\nliability on the appellants in any way.                  To cinch matters, the\n\nappellants do not allege any facts which, under Rhode Island law,\n\nmight justify judicial disregard of the clear contractual text. We\n\nconclude, therefore, that because these agreements do not purport\n\n\n\n\n                                         12\n\fto impose any personal liability on account of discharged debts,\n\nsection 524(c) does not affect their enforceability.\n\n            The appellants labor to avoid this dead end.                 Their\n\nescape route involves two related points:           that Sears, by means of\n\nits self-serving valuation tables, greatly overstated the worth of\n\nthe collateral, and that the district court disregarded the method\n\nof   Rule   12(b)(6)    when   it    failed   to   indulge   the   appellants'\n\nallegation    that     these   inflated     valuations   represented    veiled\n\nattempts to collect on account of discharged debts. But this route\n\nalso leads to a blind alley, for it overlooks the express terms of\n\nthe redemption agreements.\n\n            In these agreements, the appellants attest that they\n\n\"agreed [to] the replacement value of the . . . property, for the\n\npurpose of redemption.\" They then agreed that, upon payment of the\n\nstipulated amount(s), \"Sears [sic] security interest in the . . .\n\nmerchandise shall be terminated.\" Each agreement, therefore, makes\n\nmanifest the parties' objective intent:              to leave the goods in\n\nsitu, settle upon an agreed fair market value, and exchange that\n\nsum for extinguishment of Sears's right of repossession.                   The\n\nappellants' attempt to contradict this clear contractual language\n\ncannot be credited.       See Clorox, 228 F.3d at 32.\n\n            In an effort to rebut this reasoning, the appellants\n\nsuggest that the redemption agreements lack force because they were\n\nnot judicially approved.            This is a red herring:         neither the\n\n\n                                       13\n\fBankruptcy Code nor the implementing rules demand judicial approval\n\nof   all    redemption   agreements.        The   relevant   section   of   the\n\nBankruptcy Code provides that an \"individual debtor may\" redeem\n\ncertain property.        11 U.S.C. § 722.          In a similar vein, the\n\nrelevant bankruptcy rule provides that \"the court may authorize the\n\nredemption\" upon the debtor's motion.              Fed. R. Bankr. P. 6008.\n\nThese provisions are obviously precatory.            There is no imperative\n\nrequiring judicial approval in every instance; \"only when there is\n\nsome disagreement between the individual debtor and the secured\n\ncreditor, usually . . . over value, is the court called upon to\n\nact.\"      10 Lawrence P. King et al., Collier on Bankruptcy ¶ 6008.04\n\n(15th rev. ed. 2002).     The complaints in these cases do not contain\n\nany allegation that the parties reached any such impasse in their\n\nredemption negotiations.\n\n              That   omission    conclusively      rebuts    the   appellants'\n\nsuggestion.      Taken in light of the explicit terminology of the\n\nredemption      agreements,     the   omission    reveals    the   appellants'\n\n\"motive\" allegation to be nothing but a bald assertion about an\n\nundisclosed intent.      Because such an assertion flies in the teeth\n\nof explicit contractual language, it must be disregarded.              To hold\n\notherwise would frustrate both Rhode Island contract law, e.g.,\n\nNewport Plaza, 985 F.2d at 644-46; Woon. Teachers' Guild, 367 A.2d\n\nat 205, and federal procedural orthodoxy, e.g., Young, ___ F.3d at\n\n___ [slip op. at 17-18]; Clorox, 228 F.3d at 32.\n\n\n                                       14\n\f          The   appellants   next   asseverate   that   Sears   violated\n\nsection 524 by deliberately awaiting the conclusion of bankruptcy\n\nproceedings before asserting its right of repossession.         They say\n\nthat redemption under 11 U.S.C. § 722 is supposed to occur during\n\nthe pendency of a bankruptcy proceeding, and that, therefore, Sears\n\nhad no right to wait until after the granting of a discharge to\n\npropose settlement terms.     Because Sears failed to file a claim\n\nduring the bankruptcy proceedings, this thesis runs, any payment\n\nfor the goods would necessarily be on account of discharged debt\n\n(and, thus, violative of the bankruptcy discharge injunction).        To\n\nthis they add that the district court erred in finding, contrary to\n\nthe allegations of the complaints, that \"Sears only sought to\n\nrecover property in which it had a security interest.\" Arruda, 273\n\nB.R. at 344.    These contentions are meritless.\n\n          It is hornbook law that a valid lien survives a discharge\n\nin bankruptcy unless it is avoidable and the debtor takes the\n\nproper steps to avoid it.    Holloway v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins.\n\nCo. (In re Holloway), 81 F.3d 1062, 1063 (11th Cir. 1996).             A\n\nsurviving lien remains enforceable, for \"a bankruptcy discharge\n\nextinguishes only one mode of enforcing a claim — namely, an action\n\nagainst the debtor in personam — while leaving intact another —\n\nnamely, an action against the debtor in rem.\"           Johnson v. Home\n\nState Bank, 501 U.S. 78, 84 (1991).\n\n\n\n\n                                    15\n\f              Generally speaking — the possible exceptions are not\n\napposite      here    —     nothing   in    the   Bankruptcy   Code    imposes   an\n\naffirmative duty on a lienholder to assert its in rem rights prior\n\nto the debtor's securing of a discharge. See Farrey v. Sanderfoot,\n\n500 U.S. 291, 297 (1991).                  This flexible sequencing is fully\n\nconsistent with the Bankruptcy Code's automatic stay provision, 11\n\nU.S.C. § 362, which — unless and until the stay is lifted —\n\nordinarily      will      prevent     a   creditor   from   attempting    to   take\n\npossession of any part of the debtor's estate prior to discharge.\n\nAccordingly, we conclude that a lienholder does not violate section\n\n524(a)   by    waiting       until    a    bankruptcy   case   is   closed   before\n\nasserting its in rem rights.\n\n              We     also    conclude,      notwithstanding     the    appellants'\n\nimportunings, that a lienholder does not violate any provision of\n\nthe Bankruptcy Code merely by proposing redemption terms to a\n\ndebtor after the latter has received a general discharge. Cf. Jamo\n\nv. Katahdin Fed. Credit Union (In re Jamo), 283 F.3d 392, 399 (1st\n\nCir. 2002) (holding, in the bankruptcy reaffirmation context, that\n\n\"a creditor may discuss and negotiate terms for reaffirmation with\n\na debtor without violating the automatic stay as long as the\n\ncreditor refrains from coercion or harassment\").                    Even after the\n\ntermination of a bankruptcy case, a discharged debtor who wishes to\n\nredeem property pursuant to section 722, but who believes that the\n\nterms proposed by the lienholder are unfair, can ask the bankruptcy\n\n\n                                            16\n\fcourt to reopen the bankruptcy case and adjudicate the matter. See\n\nIn re Cassel, 41 B.R. 737, 740 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1984).    It follows\n\nthat, at least in the absence of factually supported allegations of\n\ncoercion or harassment,2 the appellants fail to state a claim\n\nsimply by juxtaposing Sears's timing and its proposed settlement\n\nterms.\n\n             The appellants' last bankruptcy-related argument hinges\n\non their assertion that Sears never wanted to enforce its rights in\n\nthe property, but, rather, aspired all along to collect money. The\n\ndistrict court found this argument unpersuasive, Arruda, 273 B.R.\n\nat 344-45, and so do we.\n\n          Home State Bank makes clear that the in rem right that\n\nsurvives bankruptcy is a \"'right to payment' in the form of [the\n\nlienholder's] right to the proceeds from the sale of the debtor's\n\nproperty.\"     501 U.S. at 84.    Section 722 gives the debtor, in\n\neffect, \"a right of first refusal . . . in consumer goods that\n\nmight otherwise be repossessed.\"       H.R. Rep. No. 95-595, at 381\n\n(1978), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5963, 6337.        Thus, the\n\nlienholder's right to repossess is nothing more than a right to an\n\n\n     2\n      The instant complaints are devoid of any such allegations.\nAlthough the Kowals charge Sears with \"obtaining possession of\ncollateral for the purpose of coercing debtors into paying money,\"\nthe most that can be inferred from the facts upon which this naked\nconclusion rests is that Sears drove a hard bargain. A creditor's\nuse of its leverage, in and of itself, does not constitute\ncoercion. Jamo, 283 F.3d at 401. Whether there is the basis for\na state-law claim is, of course, another matter — and one on which\nwe take no view.\n\n                                  17\n\fequitable remedy for the debtor's default.               Home State Bank, 501\n\nU.S. at 84.        The fact that this surviving right is in rem only\n\nlimits the recourse that the lienholder can take to repossession or\n\nobtaining     an    amount   of    money    reflecting    the   value   of   the\n\ncollateral.\n\n            Here, all the complaints admit that the parties agreed to\n\nthe values and that Sears's only proposed course of action, absent\n\nsuch an agreement, was replevin.            Given these uncontested facts,\n\nthe complaints fail to state a cognizable claim, for Sears was\n\nacting within the scope of its in rem rights — rights that survived\n\nthe granting of the debtors' bankruptcy discharges.             Consequently,\n\nany conflict between the allegation that Sears was more interested\n\nin money than in goods and the district court's conclusion that\n\nSears's intent was to repossess property is harmless.\n\n            That ends our inquiry into the alleged Bankruptcy Code\n\nviolations.        The redemption agreements that Sears proposed do not\n\nseek to impose personal liability on the debtors on account of\n\ndischarged debts — indeed, they relate to discharged debts in only\n\nthe most tangential way.          They therefore fall outside the purview\n\nof section 524(c).        Thus, the district court correctly concluded\n\nthat the facts as alleged in the several complaints failed to state\n\nactionable claims for federal bankruptcy-law violations.3\n\n\n     3\n      We do not reach the question of whether the complaints limn\nactionable claims for fraud, false pretenses, or the like. Those\nare matters for a state court to determine.\n\n                                       18\n\f                            B.    The FDCPA Claim.\n\n             The   FDCPA   is    a   landmark     piece    of   consumer   credit\n\nlegislation designed to eliminate abusive, deceptive, and other\n\nunfair debt collection practices.             15 U.S.C. § 1692.       The Kowals'\n\namended complaint charges that the individual defendants (lawyers\n\nretained by Sears) violated this statute.4                The FDCPA is detailed\n\nand prohibits many activities.           The basic premise of the statutory\n\nscheme, however, is that its prophylaxis applies in connection with\n\nthe collection of debts.          See, e.g., id. § 1692e.          At a minimum,\n\ntherefore,    a    complaint     must    allege   a     scenario   involving   the\n\ncollection (or attempted collection) of a debt.\n\n             The FDCPA defines debt, in pertinent part, to mean \"any\n\nobligation or alleged obligation of a consumer to pay money.\"                  Id.\n\n§ 1692a(5).    Although this language is broad, it is plain that the\n\nsine qua non of a debt is the existence of an obligation (actual or\n\nalleged).     See Ernst v. Jesse L. Riddle, P.C., 964 F. Supp. 213,\n\n215 (M.D. La. 1997).       We mine the Kowals' complaint in search of an\n\nallegation pertaining to this element.\n\n             The   complaint     avers    that    the    individual   defendants\n\ninfracted the FDCPA by, inter alia, communicating to the appellants\n\nthe option of retaining the collateral \"in exchange for the payment\n\nof money.\"    The complaint further alleges that this offer was made\n\n\n     4\n      The Kowals do not accuse Sears of violating the FDCPA,\npresumably because Sears would not fit within the statutory\ndefinition of \"debt collector.\" 15 U.S.C. § 1692a(6).\n\n                                         19\n\f\"for the purpose of coercing [the appellants] into paying money on\n\ndischarged debts.\"   Except for multiple references to \"discharged\n\ndebts,\" the complaint is silent as to the \"debt\" element of the\n\nasserted FDCPA cause of action.\n\n            It is readily evident, therefore, that the complaint\n\nrefers to the payment of money — but the FDCPA does not broadly\n\nforbid practices in connection with all payments of money.     The\n\npractices that it proscribes are in connection with the collection\n\nof debts, and the complaint makes no reference to any obligation to\n\npay money — the crux of \"debt\" as that term is defined by the\n\nFDCPA.     Moreover, none of the facts set forth in the complaint\n\nsupport an inference that the Kowals were obligated to pay any\n\nmoney to Sears.    Thus, to allow these allegations to trigger the\n\nFDCPA would require us to read the word \"obligation\" out of the\n\nstatute.    There is no principled way to indulge such a reading.\n\nSee Lopez-Soto, 175 F.3d at 173 (explaining that all words in a\n\nstatute must be given meaning and effect).\n\n            The complaint's references to discharged debts do not\n\nsalvage the FDCPA claim.    A \"discharge extinguishes . . . 'the\n\npersonal liability of the debtor.'\"    Home State Bank, 501 U.S. at\n\n83 (quoting 11 U.S.C. § 524(a)(1)).    Once that liability has been\n\nextinguished in bankruptcy, the debtor no longer has a personal\n\n\"financial or pecuniary obligation\" for the debt.      Black's Law\n\n\n\n\n                                  20\n\fDictionary 925 (7th ed. 1999).         Hence, a discharged debt carries\n\nwith it no personal obligation to pay money.\n\n           In sum, the FDCPA's definition of debt is broad, but it\n\nrequires   at   least   the   existence   or    alleged   existence     of    an\n\nobligation   to   pay   money.    To   permit    the   mere   mention    of    a\n\ndischarged debt, for which the debtor has no personal financial\n\nobligation, to satisfy the FDCPA requirement would contradict the\n\nplain language of the statute.     Although a court, faced with a Rule\n\n12(b)(6) motion, must mine the factual terrain of the complaint and\n\nindulge every reasonable inference in the pleader's favor, it\n\ncannot uphold a complaint that fails to establish an essential\n\nnexus between the underlying events and the theory of relief.                See\n\nMiranda v. Ponce Fed. Bank, 948 F.2d 41, 44 (1st Cir. 1991).             This\n\nis such a case:   the complaint fails to link the Kowals' discharged\n\npersonal liability with any obligation on their part to pay money.\n\n           Let us be perfectly clear. We recognize that a plaintiff\n\nmay bring a claim under the FDCPA by pleading that a debt collector\n\nfalsely alleged an obligation to pay money.            But the complaint in\n\nthis case fails to state a claim under that theory.           The complaint\n\nnever asserts that the lawyers told the Kowals that they were\n\nobligated to pay money on account of the discharged debts or\n\notherwise, nor does it allege facts sufficient to support an\n\ninference that the lawyers acted so as to create this false\n\n\n\n\n                                    21\n\fimpression.    Indeed, the collection letters (attached to the\n\ncomplaint) conclusively refute any such illation.\n\n          Those letters presented the Kowals with the terms under\n\nwhich Sears was willing to abandon its right of repossession, no\n\nmore and no less.   The letters indicated the amount of money that\n\n\"Sears believe[d] . . . represent[ed] the fair market value of the\n\nitems,\" and stated that if the Kowals did \"not agree with these\n\nvalues, [they had] the option of reopening the bankruptcy and\n\nseeking a valuation hearing.\"   Given this correspondence, the most\n\nthat can be said is that the Kowals faced an unhappy choice in\n\nthese transactions, not an obligation to pay money.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n           We need go no further.     Painting a pumpkin green and\n\ncalling it a watermelon will not render its contents sweet and\n\njuicy.   That analogy is useful here:   the bald assertion that the\n\nredemption agreements were efforts to collect discharged debts will\n\nnot suffice to transform them into something they plainly are not.\n\nBy failing to show that these agreements sought to impose personal\n\nliability, the appellants fail to state a claim that Sears violated\n\nthe bankruptcy discharge injunction.      By the same token, the\n\nappellants' failure to make out a nexus between the discharged debt\n\nand any existing or alleged obligation to pay money undermines any\n\nclaim against the individual defendants for transgressing the\n\n\n\n\n                                 22\n\fFDCPA.   Consequently, the district court did not err in dismissing\n\nthe appellants' complaints.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 23\n\f                                 APPENDIX\n\n                     MEMORANDUM OF REDEMPTION\n\nI, Melanie Velleco (debtor), hereby elect to exercise my right\nunder Section 722 of the Bankruptcy Code to redeem the personal\nproperty listed below from the purchase money security interest\nheld by Sears, Roebuck and Co. or one or more of its affiliates\n(\"Sears\"):\n\nMerchandise:            Agreed Value\nREFRIGERATOR                    $303.99\n\n                        Total:    $303.99\n\nThe above listed property is intended for personal, family or\nhousehold use and is either exempted under Section 522 of the\nBankruptcy Code or was abandoned under Section 554 of the\nBankruptcy Code.

The lienholder retains a right of repossession, subject, however, to the bankrupt's possible right of redemption. If timely exercised, this right of redemption allows an individual Chapter 7 debtor to \"redeem [certain] tangible personal property intended primarily for personal, family, or household use, from a lien securing a dischargeable consumer debt\" by paying the lienholder a sum equal to \"the amount of the allowed secured claim.\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 722 (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cases that undergird this appeal present something of an anomaly.

This claim &#8212; that the individual defendants (lawyers representing Sears) transgressed the FDCPA while supposedly attempting to effect repossession &#8212; requires a determination of whether the FDCPA reaches the defendants' activities. That, in turn, requires us to consider the nature of a \"debt\" as that term is employed in the FDCPA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court wrote a thoughtful opinion in which it answered both the bankruptcy and the FDCPA questions adversely to the appellants. <i>Arruda v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.,</i> 273 B.R. 332 (D.R.I. 2002). It thereupon dismissed their complaints. <i>Id.</i> at 351. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the district court's order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court has furnished an exegetic account of each appellant's situation and the litigation's procedural history. <i>See id.</i> at 340-42. Rather than repastinate that well-plowed soil, we present here only the background facts necessary to frame the issues on appeal. Because the district court acted under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), we derive these facts from the several complaints, purged, however, of empty rhetoric. <i>See SEC v. SG Ltd.,</i> 265 F.3d 42, 44 (1st Cir.2001); <i>Aulson v. Blanchard,</i> 83 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants are Rhode Island residents, all of whom had filed for personal bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 701-784 (2000). Each had purchased consumer goods from Sears (e.g., refrigerators, sewing machines) prior to filing for bankruptcy. On the filing date, each owed money to Sears for the purchases and each listed the Sears debt as an unsecured, nonpriority claim on his/her bankruptcy schedules. The bankruptcy court granted each appellant a general discharge encompassing the Sears indebtedness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the discharges did not erase Sears's prepetition security interest in the purchased property. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 522(c) and (f); <i>see also In re Brown,</i> 73 B.R. 740, 745 (Bankr.W.D.Wis.1987) (discussing how section 522 operates in connection with purchase money security interests in household goods). Relying on this fact, Sears thereafter asserted its rights of repossession. Its correspondence with the appellant Dorothy Arruda was typical. Sears's letter asked Arruda to contact its office to arrange for turning over the collateral (in her case, a range hood, a lawn mower, and a sewing machine). Arruda no longer possessed two of the three items in which Sears claimed an interest. When she called to discuss the situation, she was told by a Sears representative that she could either surrender the goods or redeem them by paying their fair market value as determined by Sears.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two other appellants, Melanie Velleco and Blanche Sroka, had similar experiences. In each instance, lawyers representing Sears insisted that the discharged debtor either surrender the affected property voluntarily, state an intention to redeem it, or forfeit it through state replevin proceedings in which \"the Sheriff [would] go out with [a Sears representative] to take possession of the items in question.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sears's interaction with the appellants Vincent and Kathleen Kowal was along the same lines. The Kowals allege that various individuals representing Sears sent them letters offering to allow them to retain the articles that were the subject of the replevin action (a bicycle, a gas range, a sofa, and some exercise equipment) in exchange for a payment equaling the merchandise's fair market value. These letters indicated that the Kowals had \"requested payment terms to settle Sears' claim of repossession\" and that \"Sears will settle the claim[s] for a lump sum payment\" (totaling $1,165.37 for the four items) that \"Sears believe[d] ... represent[ed] the fair market value of the items.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In every case, the appellants eventually received documents which, for present purposes, were materially identical to the memorandum of redemption received by Velleco and reproduced in the appendix. Arruda, Velleco, and Sroka each signed the proffered redemption agreement and returned it to Sears with a check reflecting the \"agreed value\" specified therein. The Kowals signed a similar redemption agreement for the sofa and gas range, paying the amount established by Sears for those items. They did not attempt to redeem either the bicycle or the exercise equipment, and Sears subsequently repossessed those articles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without exception, Sears asserted its right of repossession only after an appellant's bankruptcy proceedings were completed. Once a discharged debtor signed a redemption agreement, Sears notified his/her attorney that it was unable to file the agreement because the bankruptcy case was closed. <i>See generally</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167; 501 (permitting, but not requiring, secured creditor to file a proof of claim or interest during the pendency of bankruptcy proceedings). It stated, however, that it nonetheless intended to honor the agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants allege that the amounts Sears required in order to release its security liens on the goods bore no correlation to actual market values (and, in fact, exceeded market value). The appellants also allege that the cost of replevying the goods outweighed any residual value that Sears realistically could have hoped to realize from a resale of the merchandise. Conspicuously absent are allegations that the redemption values were in any way linked to the amount of the debt owed with respect to the purchase of the goods.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, the appellants portray Sears's activities as part of an illicit scheme: they envision Sears as lying in wait until a debtor's bankruptcy case is closed and then &#8212; with the Bankruptcy Court's attention focused elsewhere &#8212; contacting the debtor and threatening to repossess useful household goods unless the debtor enters into a high-priced redemption agreement. This scheme, the appellants say, violates the bankruptcy discharge injunction, 11 U.S.C. &#167; 524, as an attempt to collect discharged debt without judicial approval of either the redemption agreements or the valuations assigned to individual items of collateral. The Kowals add two further arguments: that Sears's use of inaccurate valuation tables and other scurrilous tactics constitute fraud and false pretenses, and that the debt collectors' actions violate the FDCPA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Treating the several cases as an integrated whole, the district court dismissed the complaints insofar as they purported to allege federal claims. As to the bankruptcy issues, the court ruled that Sears's efforts anent repossession (and the ensuing redemption agreements) did not offend the Bankruptcy Code. <i>Arruda,</i> 273 B.R. at 348. As to the remaining federal issue, the court held that the FDCPA did not apply to the challenged activities. <i>Id.</i> at 349-51. Finally, the court declined to retain supplemental jurisdiction over the appellants' state-law claims, dismissing them without prejudice. <i>Id.</i> at 351 (citing 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367(a)). This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a district court's dismissal of an action for failure to state a claim de novo. <i>Garrett v. Tandy Corp.,</i> 295 F.3d 94, 97 (1st Cir.2002). In so doing, we follow the same rules that bound the district court. Consequently, we assume the truth of all well-pleaded facts and indulge all reasonable inferences therefrom that fit the plaintiff's stated theory of liability. <i>Rogan v. Menino,</i> 175 F.3d 75, 77 (1st Cir.1999). In that process, we give no weight to \"bald assertions, unsupportable conclusions, and opprobrious epithets.\" <i>Chongris v. Bd. of Appeals,</i> 811 F.2d 36, 37 (1st Cir.1987) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Within these guidelines, we will affirm a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal only if \"the factual averments do not justify recovery on some theory adumbrated in the complaint.\" <i>Rogan,</i> 175 F.3d at 77.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two special principles are also relevant here. For one thing, the appellants attached various documents, including the memoranda of redemption, to their complaints. When a complaint annexes and incorporates by reference a written instrument, any inconsistencies between the complaint and the instrument must be resolved in favor of the latter. <i>See Clorox Co. P.R. v. Proctor &amp; Gamble Commercial Co.,</i> 228 F.3d 24, 32 (1st Cir.2000); <i>see also Young v. Lepone,</i> 305 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 2002). For another thing, the Civil Rules require fraud to be pleaded with particularity. Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b). This requirement \"entails specifying in the pleader's complaint the time, place, and content of the alleged false or fraudulent representations.\" <i>Powers v. Boston Cooper Corp.,</i> 926 F.2d 109, 111 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With this framework in place, we turn to the appellants' assignments of error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>The Bankruptcy Discharge Injunction.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most pervasive issue in this case hinges on the scope and operation of the bankruptcy discharge injunction, 11 U.S.C. &#167; 524. This is a matter of statutory construction, and we approach it by examining the language of the pertinent statutes. <i>United States v. Charles George Trucking Co.,</i> 823 F.2d 685, 688 (1st Cir.1987). In determining the meaning of a statute, we presume that Congress intended all of the constituent words and passages to have meaning and effect. <i>Lopez-Soto v. Hawayek,</i> 175 F.3d 170, 173 (1st Cir.1999). Concomitantly, we \"defer to Congress's choice of phrase and give words used in a statute their ordinary and accepted meaning.\" <i>C.K. Smith &amp; Co. v. Motiva Enters. LLC,</i> 269 F.3d 70, 76 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 524(c) deals specifically with agreements between debtors and those who hold claims against them. It states in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An agreement between a holder of a claim and the debtor, the consideration for which, in whole or in part, is based on a debt that is dischargeable in a case under this title is enforceable only to any extent enforceable under applicable nonbankruptcy law ... [and] only if [certain elements not relevant here are satisfied].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">11 U.S.C. &#167; 524(c). For present purposes, then, the threshold inquiry is whether the consideration underlying a particular redemption agreement is based to any degree on a debt that is dischargeable (or that has been discharged) in bankruptcy. This inquiry involves two different bodies of law: the dischargeability of a debt is a matter of federal bankruptcy law, but whether the consideration for the underlying agreement is based on that debt is a matter of state contract law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the federal question. Although the terms \"discharge\" and \"dischargeable\" are not explicitly defined in the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. &#167; 524(a) sheds considerable light upon the matter. It states that a \"discharge ... voids any judgment ... to the extent that [it] is a determination of the <i>personal liability</i> of the debtor ... [and enjoins] the commencement or continuation of an action, the employment of process, or any act, to collect, recover or offset any such debt as a <i>personal liability</i> of the debtor....\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 524(a)(1)-(2) (emphasis supplied). Thus, only a debtor's personal liability is dischargeable in a Chapter 7 case. It follows, therefore, that the strictures of section 524(c) apply only to those agreements the consideration for which involves, in whole or in part, the imposition (or reimposition) of personal liability with respect to a debt dischargeable (or previously discharged) in bankruptcy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the second phase of our inquiry. Here, the relevant state law is the law of Rhode Island. Under Rhode Island law, \"[u]nambiguous language is to be accorded its plain and natural meaning.\" <i>Newport Plaza Assocs. v. Durfee Attleboro Bank,</i> 985 F.2d 640, 645 (1st Cir.1993). The interpretation of such language presents a question of law. <i>Id.</i> at 644 (citing <i>Judd Realty, Inc. v. Tedesco,</i> 400 A.2d 952, 955 (R.I.1979)). And when intent is plainly revealed by the express terms of a written contract, an inquiring court should not search for \"some undisclosed intent ... but [rather, look to that intent] ... expressed by the language contained in the contract.\" <i>Woon. Teachers' Guild, Local 951 v. School Comm.,</i> 117 R.I. 373, 367 A.2d 203, 205 (R.I.1976).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each redemption agreement at issue here contains an explicit acknowledgment that \"the Debtor's failure to redeem as described within this agreement shall not impose any personal liability on the Debtor.\" Each agreement adds that \"if the debtor fails to pay the redemption amount, Sears' only recourse is against the collateral.\" This language appears just above the agreement's signature line and just below the underscored heading: <i>\"No Personal Liability.\"</i> The appellants do not allege that they were unaware of this language; indeed, their complaints confirm that they consented to this very formulation. Given these facts, the agreements cannot plausibly be interpreted to impose personal liability on the appellants in any way. To cinch matters, the appellants do not allege any facts which, under Rhode Island law, might justify judicial disregard of the clear contractual text. We conclude, therefore, that because these agreements do not purport to impose any personal liability on account of discharged debts, section 524(c) does not affect their enforceability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants labor to avoid this dead end. Their escape route involves two related points: that Sears, by means of its self-serving valuation tables, greatly overstated the worth of the collateral, and that the district court disregarded the method of Rule 12(b)(6) when it failed to indulge the appellants' allegation that these inflated valuations represented veiled attempts to collect on account of discharged debts. But this route also leads to a blind alley, for it overlooks the express terms of the redemption agreements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In these agreements, the appellants attest that they \"agreed [to] the replacement value of the ... property, for the purpose of redemption.\" They then agreed that, upon payment of the stipulated amount(s), \"Sears [sic] security interest in the ... merchandise shall be terminated.\" Each agreement, therefore, makes manifest the parties' objective intent: to leave the goods <i>in situ,</i> settle upon an agreed fair market value, and exchange that sum for extinguishment of Sears's right of repossession. The appellants' attempt to contradict this clear contractual language cannot be credited. <i>See Clorox,</i> 228 F.3d at 32.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to rebut this reasoning, the appellants suggest that the redemption agreements lack force because they were not judicially approved. This is a red herring: neither the Bankruptcy Code nor the implementing rules demand judicial approval of all redemption agreements. The relevant section of the Bankruptcy Code provides that an \"individual debtor may\" redeem certain property. 11 U.S.C. &#167; 722. In a similar vein, the relevant bankruptcy rule provides that \"the court may authorize the redemption\" upon the debtor's motion. Fed. R. Bankr.P. 6008. These provisions are obviously precatory. There is no imperative requiring judicial approval in every instance; \"only when there is some disagreement between the individual debtor and the secured creditor, usually... over value, is the court called upon to act.\" 10 Lawrence P. King et al., <i>Collier on Bankruptcy</i> &#182; 6008.04 (15th rev. ed.2002). The complaints in these cases do not contain any allegation that the parties reached any such impasse in their redemption negotiations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That omission conclusively rebuts the appellants' suggestion. Taken in light of the explicit terminology of the redemption agreements, the omission reveals the appellants' \"motive\" allegation to be nothing but a bald assertion about an undisclosed intent. Because such an assertion flies in the teeth of explicit contractual language, it must be disregarded. To hold otherwise would frustrate both Rhode Island contract law, <i>e.g., Newport Plaza,</i> 985 F.2d at 644-46; <i>Woon. Teachers' Guild,</i> 367 A.2d at 205, and federal procedural orthodoxy, <i>e.g., Young,</i> 305 F.3d at 10; <i>Clorox,</i> 228 F.3d at 32.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants next asseverate that Sears violated section 524 by deliberately awaiting the conclusion of bankruptcy proceedings before asserting its right of repossession. They say that redemption under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 722 is supposed to occur during the pendency of a bankruptcy proceeding, and that, therefore, Sears had no right to wait until after the granting of a discharge to propose settlement terms. Because Sears failed to file a claim during the bankruptcy proceedings, this thesis runs, any payment for the goods would necessarily be on account of discharged debt (and, thus, violative of the bankruptcy discharge injunction). To this they add that the district court erred in finding, contrary to the allegations of the complaints, that \"Sears only sought to recover property in which it had a security interest.\" <i>Arruda,</i> 273 B.R. at 344. These contentions are meritless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is hornbook law that a valid lien survives a discharge in bankruptcy unless it is avoidable and the debtor takes the proper steps to avoid it. <i>Holloway v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co.</i> (<i>In re Holloway</i>), 81 F.3d 1062, 1063 (11th Cir. 1996). A surviving lien remains enforceable, for \"a bankruptcy discharge extinguishes only one mode of enforcing a claim &#8212; namely, an action against the debtor <i>in personam</i> &#8212; while leaving intact another &#8212; namely, an action against the debtor in rem.\" <i>Johnson v. Home State Bank,</i> 501 U.S. 78, 84, 111 S.Ct. 2150, 115 L.Ed.2d 66 (1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Generally speaking &#8212; the possible exceptions are not apposite here &#8212; nothing in the Bankruptcy Code imposes an affirmative duty on a lienholder to assert its <i>in rem</i> rights prior to the debtor's securing of a discharge. <i>See Farrey v. Sanderfoot,</i> 500 U.S. 291, 297, 111 S.Ct. 1825, 114 L.Ed.2d 337 (1991). This flexible sequencing is fully consistent with the Bankruptcy Code's automatic stay provision, 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362, which &#8212; unless and until the stay is lifted &#8212; ordinarily will prevent a creditor from attempting to take possession of any part of the debtor's estate prior to discharge. Accordingly, we conclude that a lienholder does not violate section 524(a) by waiting until a bankruptcy case is closed before asserting its <i>in rem</i> rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also conclude, notwithstanding the appellants' importunings, that a lienholder does not violate any provision of the Bankruptcy Code merely by proposing redemption terms to a debtor after the latter has received a general discharge. <i>Cf. Jamo v. Katahdin Fed. Credit Union</i> (<i>In re Jamo</i>), 283 F.3d 392, 399 (1st Cir. 2002) (holding, in the bankruptcy reaffirmation context, that \"a creditor may discuss and negotiate terms for reaffirmation with a debtor without violating the automatic stay as long as the creditor refrains from coercion or harassment\"). Even after the termination of a bankruptcy case, a discharged debtor who wishes to redeem property pursuant to section 722, but who believes that the terms proposed by the lienholder are unfair, can ask the bankruptcy court to reopen the bankruptcy case and adjudicate the matter. <i>See In re Cassell,</i> 41 B.R. 737, 740 (Bankr.E.D.Va. 1984). It follows that, at least in the absence of factually supported allegations of coercion or harassment,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> the appellants fail to state a claim simply by juxtaposing Sears's timing and its proposed settlement terms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants' last bankruptcy-related argument hinges on their assertion that Sears never wanted to enforce its rights in the property, but, rather, aspired all along to collect money. The district court found this argument unpersuasive, <i>Arruda,</i> 273 B.R. at 344-45, and so do we.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Home State Bank</i> makes clear that the <i>in rem</i> right that survives bankruptcy is a \"`right to payment' in the form of [the lienholder's] right to the proceeds from the sale of the debtor's property.\" 501 U.S. at 84, 111 S.Ct. 2150. Section 722 gives the debtor, in effect, \"a right of first refusal ... in consumer goods that might otherwise be repossessed.\" H.R.Rep. No. 95-595, at 381 (1978), <i>reprinted in</i> 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5963, 6337. Thus, the lienholder's right to repossess is nothing more than a right to an equitable remedy for the debtor's default. <i>Home State Bank,</i> 501 U.S. at 84, 111 S.Ct. 2150. The fact that this surviving right is <i>in rem</i> only limits the recourse that the lienholder can take to repossession or obtaining an amount of money reflecting the value of the collateral.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, all the complaints admit that the parties agreed to the values and that Sears's only proposed course of action, absent such an agreement, was replevin. Given these uncontested facts, the complaints fail to state a cognizable claim, for Sears was acting within the scope of its <i>in rem</i> rights &#8212; rights that survived the granting of the debtors' bankruptcy discharges. Consequently, any conflict between the allegation that Sears was more interested in money than in goods and the district court's conclusion that Sears's intent was to repossess property is harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends our inquiry into the alleged Bankruptcy Code violations. The redemption agreements that Sears proposed do not seek to impose personal liability on the debtors on account of discharged debts &#8212; indeed, they relate to discharged debts in only the most tangential way. They therefore fall outside the purview of section 524(c). Thus, the district court correctly concluded that the facts as alleged in the several complaints failed to state actionable claims for federal bankruptcy-law violations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The FDCPA Claim.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FDCPA is a landmark piece of consumer credit legislation designed to eliminate abusive, deceptive, and other unfair debt collection practices. 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1692. The Kowals' amended complaint charges that the individual defendants (lawyers retained by Sears) violated this statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The FDCPA is detailed and prohibits many activities. The basic premise of the statutory scheme, however, is that its prophylaxis applies in connection with the collection of debts. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> &#167; 1692e. At a minimum, therefore, a complaint must allege a scenario involving the collection (or attempted collection) of a debt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FDCPA defines debt, in pertinent part, to mean \"any obligation or alleged obligation of a consumer to pay money.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1692a(5). Although this language is broad, it is plain that the sine qua non of a debt is the existence of an obligation (actual or alleged). <i>See Ernst v. Jesse L. Riddle, P.C.,</i> 964 F.Supp. 213, 215 (M.D.La.1997). We mine the Kowals' complaint in search of an allegation pertaining to this element.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint avers that the individual defendants infracted the FDCPA by, inter alia, communicating to the appellants the option of retaining the collateral \"in exchange for the payment of money.\" The complaint further alleges that this offer was made \"for the purpose of coercing [the appellants] into paying money on discharged debts.\" Except for multiple references to \"discharged debts,\" the complaint is silent as to the \"debt\" element of the asserted FDCPA cause of action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is readily evident, therefore, that the complaint refers to the payment of money &#8212; but the FDCPA does not broadly forbid practices in connection with all payments of money. The practices that it proscribes are in connection with the collection of debts, and the complaint makes no reference to any <i>obligation</i> to pay money &#8212; the crux of \"debt\" as that term is defined by the FDCPA. Moreover, none of the facts set forth in the complaint support an inference that the Kowals were obligated to pay any money to Sears. Thus, to allow these allegations to trigger the FDCPA would require us to read the word \"obligation\" out of the statute. There is no principled way to indulge such a reading. <i>See Lopez-Soto,</i> 175 F.3d at 173 (explaining that all words in a statute must be given meaning and effect).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint's references to discharged debts do not salvage the FDCPA claim. A \"discharge extinguishes ... `the personal liability of the debtor.'\" <i>Home State Bank,</i> 501 U.S. at 83, 111 S.Ct. 2150 (quoting 11 U.S.C. &#167; 524(a)(1)). Once that liability has been extinguished in bankruptcy, the debtor no longer has a personal \"financial or pecuniary obligation\" for the debt. Black's Law Dictionary 925 (7th ed.1999). Hence, a discharged debt carries with it no personal obligation to pay money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the FDCPA's definition of debt is broad, but it requires at least the existence or alleged existence of an obligation to pay money. To permit the mere mention of a discharged debt, for which the debtor has no personal financial obligation, to satisfy the FDCPA requirement would contradict the plain language of the statute. Although a court, faced with a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, must mine the factual terrain of the complaint and indulge every reasonable inference in the pleader's favor, it cannot uphold a complaint that fails to establish an essential nexus between the underlying events and the theory of relief. <i>See Miranda v. Ponce Fed. Bank,</i> 948 F.2d 41, 44 (1st Cir.1991). This is such a case: the complaint fails to link the Kowals' discharged personal liability with any obligation on their part to pay money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let us be perfectly clear. We recognize that a plaintiff may bring a claim under the FDCPA by pleading that a debt collector falsely alleged an obligation to pay money. But the complaint in this case fails to state a claim under that theory. The complaint never asserts that the lawyers told the Kowals that they were obligated to pay money on account of the discharged debts or otherwise, nor does it allege facts sufficient to support an inference that the lawyers acted so as to create this false impression. Indeed, the collection letters (attached to the complaint) conclusively refute any such illation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Those letters presented the Kowals with the terms under which Sears was willing to abandon its right of repossession, no more and no less. The letters indicated the amount of money that \"Sears believe[d]... represent[ed] the fair market value of the items,\" and stated that if the Kowals did \"not agree with these values, [they had] the option of reopening the bankruptcy and seeking a valuation hearing.\" Given this correspondence, the most that can be said is that the Kowals faced an unhappy choice in these transactions, not an obligation to pay money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Painting a pumpkin green and calling it a watermelon will not render its contents sweet and juicy. That analogy is useful here: the bald assertion that the redemption agreements were efforts to collect discharged debts will not suffice to transform them into something they plainly are not. By failing to show that these agreements sought to impose personal liability, the appellants fail to state a claim that Sears violated the bankruptcy discharge injunction. By the same token, the appellants' failure to make out a nexus between the discharged debt and any existing or alleged obligation to pay money undermines any claim against the individual defendants for transgressing the FDCPA. Consequently, the district court did not err in dismissing the appellants' complaints.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>APPENDIX</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>MEMORANDUM OF REDEMPTION</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I, Melanie Velleco (debtor), hereby elect to exercise my right under Section 722 of the Bankruptcy Code to redeem the personal property listed below from the purchase money security interest held by Sears, Roebuck and Co. or one or more of its affiliates (\"Sears\"):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <pre>Merchandise:      Agreed Value\nREFRIGERATOR             $303.99\n\n                  Total: $303.99</pre>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The above listed property is intended for personal, family or household use and is either exempted under Section 522 of the Bankruptcy Code or was abandoned under Section 554 of the Bankruptcy Code.

The lienholder retains a right of repossession, subject, however, to the bankrupt's possible right of redemption. If timely exercised, this right of redemption allows an individual Chapter 7 debtor to \"redeem [certain] tangible personal property intended primarily for personal, family, or household use, from a lien securing a dischargeable consumer debt\" by paying the lienholder a sum equal to \"the amount of the allowed secured claim.\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 722 (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cases that undergird this appeal present something of an anomaly. They involve a preserved security interest but no secured claim per se. Thus, they involve a right of repossession, and the parties, by instruments that they refer to as \"redemption agreements\" &#8212; we shall honor that characterization even though, technically, this may not be the type of redemption agreement that section 722 contemplates &#8212; have agreed to cancel that right of repossession on payment of an \"agreed value\" for the collateral. That value is not in issue; as we shall see, the parties agreed to specific dollar figures, and they are bound by those agreements. What is in issue are particular aspects of the negotiated transactions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be specific, the appellants &#8212; several former Chapter 7 debtors seeking to represent a putative class &#8212; maintain that the principal defendant, Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> habitually violated the Bankruptcy Code by the manner in which it essayed to enforce security liens in household goods and other personal property. Their claim has two subparts. First, they allege that redemption agreements between lienholders and debtors, entered into after the granting of a discharge in bankruptcy, invariably violate the prohibitions of the bankruptcy discharge injunction, codified in 11 U.S.C. &#167; 524. Second, they allege that, in all events, such agreements require bankruptcy court approval (which was never obtained).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to these bankruptcy-related asseverations, the appellants also advance a claim under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), 15 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1692-1692<i>o</i> (2000). This claim &#8212; that the individual defendants (lawyers representing Sears) transgressed the FDCPA while supposedly attempting to effect repossession &#8212; requires a determination of whether the FDCPA reaches the defendants' activities. That, in turn, requires us to consider the nature of a \"debt\" as that term is employed in the FDCPA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court wrote a thoughtful opinion in which it answered both the bankruptcy and the FDCPA questions adversely to the appellants. <i>Arruda v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1534032\"><a href=\"/opinion/1534032/arruda-v-sears-roebuck-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">273</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">332</span></a></span> (D.R.I. 2002). It thereupon dismissed their complaints. <i>Id.</i> at 351. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the district court's order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court has furnished an exegetic account of each appellant's situation and the litigation's procedural history. <i>See id.</i> at 340-42. Rather than repastinate that well-plowed soil, we present here only the background facts necessary to frame the issues on appeal. Because the district court acted under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), we derive these facts from the several complaints, purged, however, of empty rhetoric. <i>See SEC v. SG Ltd.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">265</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></span>, 44 (1st Cir.2001); <i>Aulson v.

Each had purchased consumer goods from Sears (e.g., refrigerators, sewing machines) prior to filing for bankruptcy. On the filing date, each owed money to Sears for the purchases and each listed the Sears debt as an unsecured, nonpriority claim on his/her bankruptcy schedules. The bankruptcy court granted each appellant a general discharge encompassing the Sears indebtedness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the discharges did not erase Sears's prepetition security interest in the purchased property. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 522(c) and (f); <i>see also In re Brown,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2026303\"><a href=\"/opinion/2026303/matter-of-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">740</span></a></span>, 745 (Bankr.W.D.Wis.1987) (discussing how section 522 operates in connection with purchase money security interests in household goods). Relying on this fact, Sears thereafter asserted its rights of repossession. Its correspondence with the appellant Dorothy Arruda was typical. Sears's letter asked Arruda to contact its office to arrange for turning over the collateral (in her case, a range hood, a lawn mower, and a sewing machine). Arruda no longer possessed two of the three items in which Sears claimed an interest. When she called to discuss the situation, she was told by a Sears representative that she could either surrender the goods or redeem them by paying their fair market value as determined by Sears.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two other appellants, Melanie Velleco and Blanche Sroka, had similar experiences. In each instance, lawyers representing Sears insisted that the discharged debtor either surrender the affected property voluntarily, state an intention to redeem it, or forfeit it through state replevin proceedings in which \"the Sheriff [would] go out with [a Sears representative] to take possession of the items in question.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sears's interaction with the appellants Vincent and Kathleen Kowal was along the same lines. The Kowals allege that various individuals representing Sears sent them letters offering to allow them to retain the articles that were the subject of the replevin action (a bicycle, a gas range, a sofa, and some exercise equipment) in exchange for a payment equaling the merchandise's fair market value. These letters indicated that the Kowals had \"requested payment terms to settle Sears' claim of repossession\" and that \"Sears will settle the claim[s] for a lump sum payment\" (totaling $1,165.37 for the four items) that \"Sears believe[d] ... represent[ed] the fair market value of the items.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In every case, the appellants eventually received documents which, for present purposes, were materially identical to the memorandum of redemption received by Velleco and reproduced in the appendix. Arruda, Velleco, and Sroka each signed the proffered redemption agreement and returned it to Sears with a check reflecting the \"agreed value\" specified therein. The Kowals signed a similar redemption agreement for the sofa and gas range, paying the amount established by Sears for those items. They did not attempt to redeem either the bicycle or the exercise equipment, and Sears subsequently repossessed those articles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without exception, Sears asserted its right of repossession only after an appellant's bankruptcy proceedings were completed. Once a discharged debtor signed a redemption agreement, Sears notified his/her attorney that it was unable to file the agreement because the bankruptcy case was closed. <i>See generally</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167; 501 (permitting, but not requiring, secured creditor to file a proof of claim or interest during the pendency of bankruptcy proceedings). It stated, however, that it nonetheless intended to honor the agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants allege that the amounts Sears required in order to release its security liens on the goods bore no correlation to actual market values (and, in fact, exceeded market value). The appellants also allege that the cost of replevying the goods outweighed any residual value that Sears realistically could have hoped to realize from a resale of the merchandise. Conspicuously absent are allegations that the redemption values were in any way linked to the amount of the debt owed with respect to the purchase of the goods.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, the appellants portray Sears's activities as part of an illicit scheme: they envision Sears as lying in wait until a debtor's bankruptcy case is closed and then &#8212; with the Bankruptcy Court's attention focused elsewhere &#8212; contacting the debtor and threatening to repossess useful household goods unless the debtor enters into a high-priced redemption agreement. This scheme, the appellants say, violates the bankruptcy discharge injunction, 11 U.S.C. &#167; 524, as an attempt to collect discharged debt without judicial approval of either the redemption agreements or the valuations assigned to individual items of collateral. The Kowals add two further arguments: that Sears's use of inaccurate valuation tables and other scurrilous tactics constitute fraud and false pretenses, and that the debt collectors' actions violate the FDCPA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Treating the several cases as an integrated whole, the district court dismissed the complaints insofar as they purported to allege federal claims. As to the bankruptcy issues, the court ruled that Sears's efforts anent repossession (and the ensuing redemption agreements) did not offend the Bankruptcy Code. <i>Arruda,</i> 273 B.R. at 348. As to the remaining federal issue, the court held that the FDCPA did not apply to the challenged activities. <i>Id.</i> at 349-51. Finally, the court declined to retain supplemental jurisdiction over the appellants' state-law claims, dismissing them without prejudice. <i>Id.</i> at 351 (citing 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367(a)). This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a district court's dismissal of an action for failure to state a claim de novo. <i>Garrett v.

For one thing, the appellants attached various documents, including the memoranda of redemption, to their complaints. When a complaint annexes and incorporates by reference a written instrument, any inconsistencies between the complaint and the instrument must be resolved in favor of the latter. <i>See Clorox Co. P.R. v. Proctor &amp; Gamble Commercial Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199109\"><a href=\"/opinion/199109/clorox-company-puert-v-proctor-gamble-com/\"><span class=\"volume\">228</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 32 (1st Cir.2000); <i>see also Young v.

For another thing, the Civil Rules require fraud to be pleaded with particularity. Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b). This requirement \"entails specifying in the pleader's complaint the time, place, and content of the alleged false or fraudulent representations.\" <i>Powers v.

It states in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An agreement between a holder of a claim and the debtor, the consideration for which, in whole or in part, is based on a debt that is dischargeable in a case under this title is enforceable only to any extent enforceable under applicable nonbankruptcy law ... [and] only if [certain elements not relevant here are satisfied].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">11 U.S.C. &#167; 524(c). For present purposes, then, the threshold inquiry is whether the consideration underlying a particular redemption agreement is based to any degree on a debt that is dischargeable (or that has been discharged) in bankruptcy. This inquiry involves two different bodies of law: the dischargeability of a debt is a matter of federal bankruptcy law, but whether the consideration for the underlying agreement is based on that debt is a matter of state contract law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the federal question. Although the terms \"discharge\" and \"dischargeable\" are not explicitly defined in the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. &#167; 524(a) sheds considerable light upon the matter. It states that a \"discharge ... voids any judgment ... to the extent that [it] is a determination of the <i>personal liability</i> of the debtor ... [and enjoins] the commencement or continuation of an action, the employment of process, or any act, to collect, recover or offset any such debt as a <i>personal liability</i> of the debtor....\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 524(a)(1)-(2) (emphasis supplied). Thus, only a debtor's personal liability is dischargeable in a Chapter 7 case. It follows, therefore, that the strictures of section 524(c) apply only to those agreements the consideration for which involves, in whole or in part, the imposition (or reimposition) of personal liability with respect to a debt dischargeable (or previously discharged) in bankruptcy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the second phase of our inquiry. Here, the relevant state law is the law of Rhode Island. Under Rhode Island law, \"[u]nambiguous language is to be accorded its plain and natural meaning.\" <i>Newport Plaza Assocs. v. Durfee Attleboro Bank,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600262\"><a href=\"/opinion/600262/in-re-newport-plaza-associates-lp-debtor-newport-plaza-associates/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span>, 645 (1st Cir.1993). The interpretation of such language presents a question of law. <i>Id.</i> at 644 (citing <i>Judd Realty, Inc. v.

And when intent is plainly revealed by the express terms of a written contract, an inquiring court should not search for \"some undisclosed intent ... but [rather, look to that intent] ... expressed by the language contained in the contract.\" <i>Woon. Teachers' Guild, Local 951 v. School Comm.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">R.I.</span> <span class=\"page\">373</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1515573\"><a href=\"/opinion/1515573/woonsocket-tchrsguild-v-school-com-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">367</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">203</span></a></span>, 205 (R.I.1976).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each redemption agreement at issue here contains an explicit acknowledgment that \"the Debtor's failure to redeem as described within this agreement shall not impose any personal liability on the Debtor.\" Each agreement adds that \"if the debtor fails to pay the redemption amount, Sears' only recourse is against the collateral.\" This language appears just above the agreement's signature line and just below the underscored heading: <i>\"No Personal Liability.\"</i> The appellants do not allege that they were unaware of this language; indeed, their complaints confirm that they consented to this very formulation. Given these facts, the agreements cannot plausibly be interpreted to impose personal liability on the appellants in any way. To cinch matters, the appellants do not allege any facts which, under Rhode Island law, might justify judicial disregard of the clear contractual text. We conclude, therefore, that because these agreements do not purport to impose any personal liability on account of discharged debts, section 524(c) does not affect their enforceability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants labor to avoid this dead end. Their escape route involves two related points: that Sears, by means of its self-serving valuation tables, greatly overstated the worth of the collateral, and that the district court disregarded the method of Rule 12(b)(6) when it failed to indulge the appellants' allegation that these inflated valuations represented veiled attempts to collect on account of discharged debts. But this route also leads to a blind alley, for it overlooks the express terms of the redemption agreements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In these agreements, the appellants attest that they \"agreed [to] the replacement value of the ... property, for the purpose of redemption.\" They then agreed that, upon payment of the stipulated amount(s), \"Sears [sic] security interest in the ... merchandise shall be terminated.\" Each agreement, therefore, makes manifest the parties' objective intent: to leave the goods <i>in situ,</i> settle upon an agreed fair market value, and exchange that sum for extinguishment of Sears's right of repossession. The appellants' attempt to contradict this clear contractual language cannot be credited. <i>See Clorox,</i> 228 F.3d at 32.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to rebut this reasoning, the appellants suggest that the redemption agreements lack force because they were not judicially approved. This is a red herring: neither the Bankruptcy Code nor the implementing rules demand judicial approval of all redemption agreements. The relevant section of the Bankruptcy Code provides that an \"individual debtor may\" redeem certain property. 11 U.S.C. &#167; 722. In a similar vein, the relevant bankruptcy rule provides that \"the court may authorize the redemption\" upon the debtor's motion. Fed. R. Bankr.P. 6008. These provisions are obviously precatory. There is no imperative requiring judicial approval in every instance; \"only when there is some disagreement between the individual debtor and the secured creditor, usually... over value, is the court called upon to act.\" 10 Lawrence P. King et al., <i>Collier on Bankruptcy</i> &#182; 6008.04 (15th rev. ed.2002). The complaints in these cases do not contain any allegation that the parties reached any such impasse in their redemption negotiations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That omission conclusively rebuts the appellants' suggestion. Taken in light of the explicit terminology of the redemption agreements, the omission reveals the appellants' \"motive\" allegation to be nothing but a bald assertion about an undisclosed intent. Because such an assertion flies in the teeth of explicit contractual language, it must be disregarded. To hold otherwise would frustrate both Rhode Island contract law, <i>e.g., Newport Plaza,</i> 985 F.2d at 644-46; <i>Woon. Teachers' Guild,</i> 367 A.2d at 205, and federal procedural orthodoxy, <i>e.g., Young,</i> 305 F.3d at 10; <i>Clorox,</i> 228 F.3d at 32.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants next asseverate that Sears violated section 524 by deliberately awaiting the conclusion of bankruptcy proceedings before asserting its right of repossession. They say that redemption under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 722 is supposed to occur during the pendency of a bankruptcy proceeding, and that, therefore, Sears had no right to wait until after the granting of a discharge to propose settlement terms. Because Sears failed to file a claim during the bankruptcy proceedings, this thesis runs, any payment for the goods would necessarily be on account of discharged debt (and, thus, violative of the bankruptcy discharge injunction). To this they add that the district court erred in finding, contrary to the allegations of the complaints, that \"Sears only sought to recover property in which it had a security interest.\" <i>Arruda,</i> 273 B.R. at 344. These contentions are meritless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is hornbook law that a valid lien survives a discharge in bankruptcy unless it is avoidable and the debtor takes the proper steps to avoid it. <i>Holloway v.

A surviving lien remains enforceable, for \"a bankruptcy discharge extinguishes only one mode of enforcing a claim &#8212; namely, an action against the debtor <i>in personam</i> &#8212; while leaving intact another &#8212; namely, an action against the debtor in rem.\" <i>Johnson v.

This flexible sequencing is fully consistent with the Bankruptcy Code's automatic stay provision, 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362, which &#8212; unless and until the stay is lifted &#8212; ordinarily will prevent a creditor from attempting to take possession of any part of the debtor's estate prior to discharge. Accordingly, we conclude that a lienholder does not violate section 524(a) by waiting until a bankruptcy case is closed before asserting its <i>in rem</i> rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also conclude, notwithstanding the appellants' importunings, that a lienholder does not violate any provision of the Bankruptcy Code merely by proposing redemption terms to a debtor after the latter has received a general discharge. <i>Cf. Jamo v. Katahdin Fed. Credit Union</i> (<i>In re Jamo</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199890\"><a href=\"/opinion/199890/katahdin-federal-v-violette/\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">392</span></a></span>, 399 (1st Cir. 2002) (holding, in the bankruptcy reaffirmation context, that \"a creditor may discuss and negotiate terms for reaffirmation with a debtor without violating the automatic stay as long as the creditor refrains from coercion or harassment\"). Even after the termination of a bankruptcy case, a discharged debtor who wishes to redeem property pursuant to section 722, but who believes that the terms proposed by the lienholder are unfair, can ask the bankruptcy court to reopen the bankruptcy case and adjudicate the matter. <i>See In re Cassell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1552192\"><a href=\"/opinion/1552192/in-re-cassell/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">737</span></a></span>, 740 (Bankr.E.D.Va. 1984). It follows that, at least in the absence of factually supported allegations of coercion or harassment,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> the appellants fail to state a claim simply by juxtaposing Sears's timing and its proposed settlement terms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants' last bankruptcy-related argument hinges on their assertion that Sears never wanted to enforce its rights in the property, but, rather, aspired all along to collect money. The district court found this argument unpersuasive, <i>Arruda,</i> 273 B.R. at 344-45, and so do we.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Home State Bank</i> makes clear that the <i>in rem</i> right that survives bankruptcy is a \"`right to payment' in the form of [the lienholder's] right to the proceeds from the sale of the debtor's property.\" 501 U.S. at 84, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112617\"><a href=\"/opinion/112617/johnson-v-home-state-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

No. 95-595, at 381 (1978), <i>reprinted in</i> 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5963, 6337. Thus, the lienholder's right to repossess is nothing more than a right to an equitable remedy for the debtor's default. <i>Home State Bank,</i> 501 U.S. at 84, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112617\"><a href=\"/opinion/112617/johnson-v-home-state-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The fact that this surviving right is <i>in rem</i> only limits the recourse that the lienholder can take to repossession or obtaining an amount of money reflecting the value of the collateral.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, all the complaints admit that the parties agreed to the values and that Sears's only proposed course of action, absent such an agreement, was replevin. Given these uncontested facts, the complaints fail to state a cognizable claim, for Sears was acting within the scope of its <i>in rem</i> rights &#8212; rights that survived the granting of the debtors' bankruptcy discharges. Consequently, any conflict between the allegation that Sears was more interested in money than in goods and the district court's conclusion that Sears's intent was to repossess property is harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends our inquiry into the alleged Bankruptcy Code violations. The redemption agreements that Sears proposed do not seek to impose personal liability on the debtors on account of discharged debts &#8212; indeed, they relate to discharged debts in only the most tangential way. They therefore fall outside the purview of section 524(c). Thus, the district court correctly concluded that the facts as alleged in the several complaints failed to state actionable claims for federal bankruptcy-law violations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The FDCPA Claim.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FDCPA is a landmark piece of consumer credit legislation designed to eliminate abusive, deceptive, and other unfair debt collection practices. 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1692. The Kowals' amended complaint charges that the individual defendants (lawyers retained by Sears) violated this statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The FDCPA is detailed and prohibits many activities. The basic premise of the statutory scheme, however, is that its prophylaxis applies in connection with the collection of debts. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> &#167; 1692e. At a minimum, therefore, a complaint must allege a scenario involving the collection (or attempted collection) of a debt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FDCPA defines debt, in pertinent part, to mean \"any obligation or alleged obligation of a consumer to pay money.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1692a(5). Although this language is broad, it is plain that the sine qua non of a debt is the existence of an obligation (actual or alleged). <i>See Ernst v. Jesse L. Riddle, P.C.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1409822\"><a href=\"/opinion/1409822/ernst-v-jesse-l-riddle-pc/\"><span class=\"volume\">964</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">213</span></a></span>, 215 (M.D.La.1997). We mine the Kowals' complaint in search of an allegation pertaining to this element.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint avers that the individual defendants infracted the FDCPA by, inter alia, communicating to the appellants the option of retaining the collateral \"in exchange for the payment of money.\" The complaint further alleges that this offer was made \"for the purpose of coercing [the appellants] into paying money on discharged debts.\" Except for multiple references to \"discharged debts,\" the complaint is silent as to the \"debt\" element of the asserted FDCPA cause of action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is readily evident, therefore, that the complaint refers to the payment of money &#8212; but the FDCPA does not broadly forbid practices in connection with all payments of money. The practices that it proscribes are in connection with the collection of debts, and the complaint makes no reference to any <i>obligation</i> to pay money &#8212; the crux of \"debt\" as that term is defined by the FDCPA. Moreover, none of the facts set forth in the complaint support an inference that the Kowals were obligated to pay any money to Sears. Thus, to allow these allegations to trigger the FDCPA would require us to read the word \"obligation\" out of the statute. There is no principled way to indulge such a reading. <i>See Lopez-Soto,</i> 175 F.3d at 173 (explaining that all words in a statute must be given meaning and effect).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint's references to discharged debts do not salvage the FDCPA claim. A \"discharge extinguishes ... `the personal liability of the debtor.'\" <i>Home State Bank,</i> 501 U.S. at 83, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112617\"><a href=\"/opinion/112617/johnson-v-home-state-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2150</span></a></span> (quoting 11 U.S.C. &#167; 524(a)(1)). Once that liability has been extinguished in bankruptcy, the debtor no longer has a personal \"financial or pecuniary obligation\" for the debt. Black's Law Dictionary 925 (7th ed.1999). Hence, a discharged debt carries with it no personal obligation to pay money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the FDCPA's definition of debt is broad, but it requires at least the existence or alleged existence of an obligation to pay money. To permit the mere mention of a discharged debt, for which the debtor has no personal financial obligation, to satisfy the FDCPA requirement would contradict the plain language of the statute. Although a court, faced with a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, must mine the factual terrain of the complaint and indulge every reasonable inference in the pleader's favor, it cannot uphold a complaint that fails to establish an essential nexus between the underlying events and the theory of relief. <i>See Miranda v. Ponce Fed. Bank,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"571255\"><a href=\"/opinion/571255/clarissa-miranda-aka-clarissa-miranda-rodriguez-v-ponce-federal-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">948</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 44 (1st Cir.1991). This is such a case: the complaint fails to link the Kowals' discharged personal liability with any obligation on their part to pay money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let us be perfectly clear. We recognize that a plaintiff may bring a claim under the FDCPA by pleading that a debt collector falsely alleged an obligation to pay money. But the complaint in this case fails to state a claim under that theory. The complaint never asserts that the lawyers told the Kowals that they were obligated to pay money on account of the discharged debts or otherwise, nor does it allege facts sufficient to support an inference that the lawyers acted so as to create this false impression. Indeed, the collection letters (attached to the complaint) conclusively refute any such illation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Those letters presented the Kowals with the terms under which Sears was willing to abandon its right of repossession, no more and no less. The letters indicated the amount of money that \"Sears believe[d]... represent[ed] the fair market value of the items,\" and stated that if the Kowals did \"not agree with these values, [they had] the option of reopening the bankruptcy and seeking a valuation hearing.\" Given this correspondence, the most that can be said is that the Kowals faced an unhappy choice in these transactions, not an obligation to pay money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Painting a pumpkin green and calling it a watermelon will not render its contents sweet and juicy. That analogy is useful here: the bald assertion that the redemption agreements were efforts to collect discharged debts will not suffice to transform them into something they plainly are not. By failing to show that these agreements sought to impose personal liability, the appellants fail to state a claim that Sears violated the bankruptcy discharge injunction. By the same token, the appellants' failure to make out a nexus between the discharged debt and any existing or alleged obligation to pay money undermines any claim against the individual defendants for transgressing the FDCPA. Consequently, the district court did not err in dismissing the appellants' complaints.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>APPENDIX</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>MEMORANDUM OF REDEMPTION</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I, Melanie Velleco (debtor), hereby elect to exercise my right under Section 722 of the Bankruptcy Code to redeem the personal property listed below from the purchase money security interest held by Sears, Roebuck and Co. or one or more of its affiliates (\"Sears\"):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <pre>Merchandise:      Agreed Value\nREFRIGERATOR             $303.99\n\n                  Total: $303.99</pre>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The above listed property is intended for personal, family or household use and is either exempted under Section 522 of the Bankruptcy Code or was abandoned under Section 554 of the Bankruptcy Code.
