In 1967, the Employers Surplus\n\nLines    Insurance       Company   (\"Employers\")      issued      a   comprehensive\n\ngeneral liability (\"CGL\") policy to Georgia-Pacific Corporation.\n\nThe standard CGL policy is designed primarily to protect the\n\ninsured from claims by third parties.                     2 Stempel, Stempel on\n\nInsurance Contracts ยง 14.01 (3d ed. 2006).                       The policy, whose\n\ncoverage period was set at three years beginning on January 1,\n\n1967,    provided    for    a   $10    million   annual     aggregate       limit    of\n\nliability as well as a $10 million per occurrence limit.1\n\n               Shortly after the policy was issued, Georgia-Pacific\n\nfound    its    interests    better     served   by   a    new    policy    from    the\n\nInsurance Company of the State of Pennsylvania (\"ICSOP\"). Georgia-\n\nPacific therefore cancelled its Employers policy effective April 1,\n\n1967, and replaced it with an ICSOP policy.                  Employers issued a\n\ncancellation endorsement that shortened the policy period, refunded\n\n$8,700 of Georgia-Pacific's $10,000 premium, and stated that \"all\n\nother terms and conditions remain unchanged.\"\n\n               Decades    later,      Georgia-Pacific       presented       OneBeacon\n\nInsurance Company, the successor to Employers, with $10 million of\n\nasbestos       product-liability       losses    allegedly        covered    by     the\n\n\n\n     1\n      The Employers policy was an excess umbrella policy, applying\nin excess of a $1 million primary policy and $9 million umbrella\npolicy, both issued by Travelers Insurance Company. Because this\nfeature of the policy does not change the analysis, but does\ncomplicate the description, we ignore it in the discussion that\nfollows.\n\n                                         -2-\n\fEmployers policy.          OneBeacon maintained that its liability was\n\ncapped at $2.5 million since the policy was only in effect for one-\n\nquarter of the year.          It sued for a declaratory judgment to that\n\neffect.     The district court granted summary judgment in Georgia-\n\nPacific's    favor,       holding    that    the    insurance     contract      nowhere\n\ncontemplated proration of the annual aggregate limit.\n\n            OneBeacon now appeals.                 Our review, on the grant of\n\nsummary judgment, is de novo.               Iverson v. City of Boston, 452 F.3d\n\n94,   98   (1st    Cir.    2006).          The    issue   being   one     of   contract\n\ninterpretation, we look to language and other common indicia (e.g.,\n\ncontext,    inferred       purpose);       extrinsic      evidence   of    commercial\n\npractice    and    negotiations       between       the   parties    might     also   be\n\nrelevant    if    there    were     any,    but    nothing   meaningful        in   these\n\ncategories was tendered by the parties.\n\n            On language alone, looking at both the policy and the\n\ncancellation endorsement, Georgia-Pacific has the better case. The\n\npolicy, although in effect for only three months, explicitly\n\nprovides $10 million in both per occurrence and aggregate annual\n\ncoverage.    Further, the cancellation endorsement stated that the\n\nonly consequences of the cancellation were the shortened period of\n\ncoverage and the refund of part of the premium: it said nothing\n\nabout modifying the aggregate limit of $10 million and substituting\n\na $2.5 million figure.\n\n\n\n\n                                            -3-\n\f            OneBeacon's    argument    from   language     focuses       on   the\n\nsentence in the original policy describing the limit as $10 million\n\n\"in the aggregate for each annual period during the currency of\n\nthis policy.\" The most straightforward reading of this language is\n\nthat the insured cannot collect from OneBeacon more than $10\n\nmillion for any year.      Consonantly, what Georgia-Pacific seeks is\n\nexactly $10 million for the period within 1967 in which the policy\n\nwas in effect.\n\n            Nor is it possible to read the phrase \"for each annual\n\nperiod\" as implying that the aggregate limit should be mechanically\n\nprorated by the day, week, month or quarter. Counsel for OneBeacon\n\nhas conceded that the insurer would be liable for $10 million--not\n\n$2.5   million--if   a    single    catastrophic   loss    (say,     a    single\n\nexplosion) had occurred on January 2, 1967.        This is so even if the\n\npolicy were cancelled a week after the event.            The concession was\n\ninevitable since no one would want $10 million per occurrence\n\ncoverage with an aggregate limit one quarter that size.\n\n            The present case differs from the hypothetical case of an\n\nexplosion because the asbestos claims do not comprise a single loss\n\ncaused by a single event.            The asbestos injuries likely are\n\ncontinuing occurrences that straddle the effective periods of the\n\nEmployers   policy   and   the     replacement   ICSOP    policy,    probably\n\nextending to periods before and after both policies.                     But the\n\nproblem of allocating a continuing loss among the many insurers who\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fwere on the risk for the loss is not peculiar to short term\n\npolicies, nor is it an excuse for a court to alter express policy\n\nlimits.\n\n          How to assign to coverage periods a claim for a slow\n\nacting disease, whose causes and effects play out over time, has\n\nbedeviled courts and produced a variety of solutions.      OneBeacon\n\nhas not sought a ruling as to which claims against Georgia-Pacific\n\nare covered by which policies; it has assumed at least arguendo\n\nthat the losses attributable to the insured period exceed $2.5\n\nmillion, and it has presented us only with the issue whether the\n\npolicy's aggregate limit is $2.5 million or $10 million.\n\n          Where a claim is the responsibility of more than one\n\ncompany, sometimes policy language assigns primary responsibility;\n\nhere, both the Employers' and ICSOP policies have an identical\n\n\"prior insurance\" and \"non-cumulation\" clause.   Courts have also\n\ndeveloped allocation rules of varying kinds.2    Here, the parties\n\nrely on neither this clause nor this case law: the only issue\n\nbefore us is whether the Employers policy's annual aggregate limit\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      Some courts hold insurers jointly and severally liable up to\ntheir respective policy limits, see Keene Corp. v. Ins. Co. of N.\nAm., 667 F.2d 1034, 1041 (D.C. Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S.\n1007 (1982); others prorate the liability by policy limits; and\nstill others prorate the liability by time on the risk, see Ins.\nCo. of N. Am. v. Forty-Eight Insulations Inc., 633 F.2d 1212, 1226\n(6th Cir. 1980), clarified in part, 657 F.2d 814 (6th Cir.), cert.\ndenied, 454 U.S. 1109 (1981). See generally 2 Stempel on Insurance\nContracts ยง 14.10.\n\n                               -5-\n\fshould be prorated.     The language of the policy says nothing about\n\nrequiring proration.\n\n            OneBeacon's better argument for its position is that\n\nreading the policy literally will produce a windfall to Georgia-\n\nPacific.     Georgia-Pacific would in effect enjoy $20 million of\n\ntotal    aggregate   coverage   against      continuing   occurrences      that\n\nstraddle 1967 periods: $10 million of coverage from the Employers\n\npolicy and another $10 million from ICSOP. Yet, OneBeacon assumes,\n\nGeorgia-Pacific would only have paid premiums for $10 million of\n\naggregate coverage.\n\n            This argument looks to the reasonable expectations of the\n\nparties, which--absent extrinsic evidence of intent--means the help\n\nthat    context,   inferred   purpose    and   common   sense   may   give    in\n\ndetermining what the parties probably intended or would have been\n\nlikely to intend if they had focused on the issue.                     See 16\n\nWilliston on Contracts ยง 49:20 (4th ed. 2006).            Courts, whatever\n\ntributes they may pay to plain language, tend to be interested in\n\nsuch    arguments,   although    the    weight   accorded   turns     on     the\n\ncircumstances. Here, the circumstances are unhelpful to OneBeacon.\n\n            OneBeacon is arguing in effect that Georgia-Pacific seeks\n\nto reap a $10 million unjustified gain, $7.5 million of which would\n\ncome at OneBeacon's expense.             But Georgia-Pacific sought $10\n\nmillion in per-occurrence and aggregate coverage from Employers and\n\na smaller aggregate would have made no sense given the per-\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\foccurrence limit.   The windfall argument therefore reduces to the\n\nquestion whether Employers would have charged Georgia-Pacific a\n\nhigher monthly premium for such coverage had the policy been sought\n\nonly for three months.\n\n           The decision as to how much of the premium to refund was\n\nwithin Employers' control, presumably governed by policy language\n\nwhich Employers drafted or adopted.    In fact, the refund was not\n\nstrictly pro rata; instead, the cancellation penalty amounted to 5\n\npercent of the total premium paid.      If Employers conferred any\n\nwindfall on Georgia-Pacific by granting a refund on these terms,\n\nthis was a self-inflicted wound.\n\n           Both sides cite case law, which we address as a matter of\n\ngeneral law.   Ordinarily, if there were marked differences in the\n\nlaws of various states, we might have to consider choice of law\n\nissues.3   But since there is no clear-cut answer to the question of\n\nwhose law a Massachusetts court would apply in this case, and since\n\nthere do not appear to be significant differences in the laws of\n\nthe relevant states, we bypass this issue.    Lexington Ins. Co. v.\n\nGen. Accident Ins. Co. of Am., 338 F.3d 42, 46 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      In this instance, the choice would be among Oregon (where\nGeorgia-Pacific was based), Washington (where Employers' managing\ngeneral agent was based), and Massachusetts (where Employers was\nlocated).   But the parties agree that no conflict of laws is\npresented in this case, so we bypass the choice of law question and\nconstrue the contract using general principles of contract law.\n\n                                 -7-\n\f            The decision cited by OneBeacon that is most closely on\n\npoint, Stonewall Insurance Co. v. National Gypsum Co., says that\n\n\"where a policy is . . . cancelled before the end of its stated\n\nperiod . . . there is no proration of the policy limits and\n\ntherefore, [the insured] is entitled to recover up to the full\n\npolicy limits for the shortened period.\"        1992 WL 188433 (S.D.N.Y.\n\n1992), at *1, aff'd sub nom, 73 F.3d 1178 (2d Cir. 1995).            Accord\n\nSybron Transition Corp. v. Security Ins. Co., 158 F. Supp. 2d 906,\n\n909-10 (E.D. Wis. 2000).\n\n            The general language, helpful to Georgia-Pacific, was\n\nqualified   by   an   exception   on   which   OneBeacon   relies.    This\n\nexception was applied in Stonewall to a particular set of facts\n\nwhere a $2 million policy was replaced part way through the policy\n\nterm with a $5 million policy from the same insurer, covering the\n\nremainder of the original policy's term.         The court held that the\n\naim of the transaction was to upgrade overall coverage to $5\n\nmillion and that a payout from the insurer of $7 million would be\n\nunreasonable.    1992 WL 188433 at *2.\n\n            But Stonewall suggested that this exception would not be\n\nlikely to apply to situations where \"there was either a total\n\nchange in the insurance carrier or a change in the level at which\n\nthe carrier became liable.\" Id. Rather, where an insurance policy\n\nis replaced or extended rather than upgraded, the general rule\n\ndisallowing proration applies.         In such circumstances, the court\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fconcluded, \"[w]hile it can be argued that [the insured] is getting\n\na windfall, it cannot be disputed that each of the insurers is\n\nsimply being held to its contract.\"     Id. at *1.\n\n           OneBeacon also cites In re Midland Insurance Co., 269\n\nA.D.2d 50, 64-65 (N.Y. App. Div. 2000), a case with facts similar\n\nto our own in which the court adopted on res judicata grounds a\n\nfederal   district   court's   decision--in   an   unreported    case--to\n\nprorate the cancelled policy's annual aggregate limit.4         But the In\n\nre Midland court noted that the district court's holding was at\n\nodds with the general rule that \"proration of policy limits is not\n\npermitted when the coverage period has been shortened.\" Id. at 65.\n\n           Georgia-Pacific claims further support from another set\n\nof cases in which the policy term is extended for a stub period but\n\nthe aggregate limits are not prorated.    E.g., Bd. of Trs. of Univ.\n\nof Ill. v. Ins. Corp. of Ireland, Ltd., 750 F. Supp. 1375, 1383-84\n\n(N.D. Ill. 1990), aff'd, 969 F.2d 329 (7th Cir. 1992).      These cases\n\ncould be distinguished, but even without them, the case law still\n\nfavors Georgia-Pacific.\n\n           Finally, in Continental Insurance Co. v. PACCAR, Inc.,\n\n634 P.2d 291 (Wash. 1981), the court prorated an annual aggregate\n\ndeductible upon cancellation of the policy by the insurer.            But\n\n\n\n     4\n      The district court's reasoning for making an exception is\ndifficult to discern from either In re Midland or a related Third\nCircuit case, Lac d'Amiante du Quebec, Ltee. v. Am. Home Assur.\nCo., 864 F.2d 1033, 1037 n.7 (3d Cir. 1988).\n\n                                  -9-\n\fthere the cancellation was initiated by the insurer which, absent\n\nproration, could have applied the whole deductible to the early\n\nlosses, pocketed the early premiums, and left the insured without\n\nthe protection from later losses that it had relied upon in paying\n\nits early premiums. Thus, the equitable argument for proration was\n\nfar stronger in that case than in ours.\n\n          It is true that one can view an aggregate limit as\n\ncomparable to the insurer's deductible.   Nevertheless, in addition\n\nto the equitable argument already noted, a central distinction\n\nremains between the two cases: in the deductible case, the insurer\n\nwho wrote the policy is manipulating it to his advantage; by\n\ncontrast, in a case like ours, the insurer is complaining about\n\nharm to it caused by its own poor draftsmanship.\n\n          Policy language, surrounding circumstances and equitable\n\nconcerns are likely to vary a good deal from case to case.   It is\n\nenough for us to say here that the policy language favors Georgia-\n\nPacific, that the most pertinent case law helps its position and\n\nthat OneBeacon has not shown that its outcome--reducing aggregate\n\ncoverage from $10 million to $2.5 million--produces a result that\n\nis either fairer or closer to reasonable expectations.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -10-\n\f",

The court held that the aim of the transaction was to upgrade overall coverage to $5 million and that a payout from the insurer of $7 million would be unreasonable. 1992 WL 188433 at *2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But <i>Stonewall</i> suggested that this exception would not be likely to apply to situations where \"there was either a total change in the insurance carrier or a change in the level at which the carrier became liable.\" <i>Id.</i> Rather, where an insurance policy is replaced or extended rather than upgraded, the general rule disallowing proration applies.

PACCAR, Inc.,</i> 96 Wash.2d 160, 634 P.2d 291 (1981), the court prorated an annual aggregate <i>deductible</i> upon cancellation of the policy by the insurer. But there the cancellation was initiated by the insurer which, absent proration, could have applied the whole deductible to the early losses, pocketed the early premiums, and left the insured without the protection from later losses that it had relied upon in paying its early premiums. Thus, the equitable argument for proration was far stronger in that case than in ours.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that one can view an aggregate limit as comparable to the insurer's deductible. Nevertheless, in addition to the equitable argument already noted, a central distinction remains between the two cases: in the deductible case, the insurer who wrote the policy is manipulating it to his advantage; by contrast, in a case like ours, the insurer is complaining about harm to it caused by its own poor draftsmanship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Policy language, surrounding circumstances and equitable concerns are likely to vary a good deal from case to case.

The standard CGL policy is designed primarily to protect the insured from claims by third parties. 2 Stempel, <i>Stempel on Insurance Contracts</i> &#167; 14.01 (3d ed.2006). The policy, whose coverage period was set at three years beginning on January 1, 1967, provided for a $10 million annual aggregate limit of liability as well as a $10 million per occurrence limit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after the policy was issued, Georgia-Pacific found its interests better served by a new policy from the Insurance Company of the State of Pennsylvania (\"ICSOP\"). Georgia-Pacific therefore cancelled its Employers policy effective April 1, 1967, and replaced it with an ICSOP policy. Employers issued a cancellation endorsement that shortened the policy period, refunded $8,700 of Georgia-Pacific's $10,000 premium, and stated that \"all other terms and conditions remain unchanged.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Decades later, Georgia-Pacific presented OneBeacon Insurance Company, the successor to Employers, with $10 million of asbestos product-liability losses allegedly covered by the Employers policy. OneBeacon maintained that its liability was capped at $2.5 million since the policy was only in effect for one-quarter of the year. It sued for a declaratory judgment to that effect. The district court granted summary judgment in Georgia-Pacific's favor, holding that the insurance contract nowhere contemplated proration of the annual aggregate limit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">OneBeacon now appeals. Our review, on the grant of summary judgment, is <i>de novo. Iverson v. City of Boston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202298\"><a href=\"/opinion/202298/iverson-v-city-of-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">94</span></a></span>, 98 (1st Cir.2006). The issue being one of contract interpretation, we look to language and other common indicia (<i>e.g.,</i> context, inferred purpose); extrinsic evidence of commercial practice and negotiations between the parties might also be relevant if there were any, but nothing meaningful in these categories was tendered by the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On language alone, looking at both the policy and the cancellation endorsement, Georgia-Pacific has the better case. The policy, although in effect for only three months, explicitly provides $10 million in both per occurrence and aggregate annual coverage. Further, the cancellation endorsement stated that the only consequences of the cancellation were the shortened period of coverage and the refund of part of the premium: it said nothing about modifying the aggregate limit of $10 million and substituting a $2.5 million figure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">OneBeacon's argument from language focuses on the sentence in the original policy describing the limit as $10 million \"in the aggregate for each annual period during the currency of this policy.\" The most straightforward reading of this language is that the insured cannot collect from OneBeacon more than $10 million for any year. Consonantly, what Georgia-Pacific seeks is exactly $10 million for the period within 1967 in which the policy was in effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is it possible to read the phrase \"for each annual period\" as implying that the aggregate limit should be mechanically prorated by the day, week, month or quarter. Counsel for OneBeacon has conceded that the insurer would be liable for $10 million &#8212; not $2.5 million &#8212; if a single catastrophic loss (say, a single explosion) had occurred on January 2, 1967. This is so even if the policy were cancelled a week after the event. The concession was inevitable since no one would want $10 million per occurrence coverage with an aggregate limit one quarter that size.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The present case differs from the hypothetical case of an explosion because the asbestos claims do not comprise a single loss caused by a single event. The asbestos injuries likely are continuing occurrences that <i>straddle</i> the effective periods of the Employers policy and the replacement ICSOP policy, probably extending to periods before and after both policies. But the problem of allocating a continuing loss among the many insurers who were on the risk for the loss is not peculiar to short term policies, nor is it an excuse for a court to alter express policy limits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">How to assign to coverage periods a claim for a slow acting disease, whose causes and effects play out over time, has bedeviled courts and produced a variety of solutions.

In such circumstances, the court concluded, \"[w]hile it can be argued that [the insured] is getting a windfall, it cannot be disputed that each of the insurers is simply being held to its contract.\" <i>Id.</i> at *1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">OneBeacon also cites <i>In re Midland Insurance Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">269</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.D.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></span>, 64-65, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">709</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.S.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></span> (N.Y.App.Div.2000), a case with facts similar to our own in which the court adopted on <i>res judicata</i> grounds a federal district court's decision &#8212; in an unreported case &#8212; to prorate the cancelled policy's annual aggregate limit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> But the <i>In re Midland</i> court noted that the district court's holding was at odds with the general rule that \"proration of policy limits is not permitted when the coverage period has been shortened.\" <i>Id.</i> at 65, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">709</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.S.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Georgia-Pacific claims further support from another set of cases in which the policy term is extended for a stub period but the aggregate limits are not prorated. <i>E.g., Bd. of Trs. of Univ. of Ill. v.

But there the cancellation was initiated by the insurer which, absent proration, could have applied the whole deductible to the early losses, pocketed the early premiums, and left the insured without the protection from later losses that it had relied upon in paying its early premiums. Thus, the equitable argument for proration was far stronger in that case than in ours.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that one can view an aggregate limit as comparable to the insurer's deductible. Nevertheless, in addition to the equitable argument already noted, a central distinction remains between the two cases: in the deductible case, the insurer who wrote the policy is manipulating it to his advantage; by contrast, in a case like ours, the insurer is complaining about harm to it caused by its own poor draftsmanship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Policy language, surrounding circumstances and equitable concerns are likely to vary a good deal from case to case. It is enough for us to say here that the policy language favors Georgia-Pacific, that the most pertinent case law helps its position and that OneBeacon has not shown that its outcome &#8212; reducing aggregate coverage from $10 million to $2.5 million &#8212; produces a result that is either fairer or closer to reasonable expectations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Employers policy was an excess umbrella policy, applying in excess of a $1 million primary policy and $9 million umbrella policy, both issued by Travelers Insurance Company.
