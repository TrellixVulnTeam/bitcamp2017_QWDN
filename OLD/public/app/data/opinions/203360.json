Appellant John\n\nMcGill appeals the district court’s grant of summary judgment\n\nagainst him on his claims that his insurer breached its insurance\n\ncontract and its fiduciary duty, and engaged in misrepresentation\n\nand fraud.     Because the insurer never contracted to pay McGill\n\ndisability benefits until age 65, we affirm.\n\n                                          I.\n\n          As this case arises on summary judgment, we state the\n\nfacts in the light most favorable to appellant.                       Anderson v.\n\nLiberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 256-57 (1986); Maldonado-Denis\n\nv. Castillo-Rodriguez, 23 F.3d 576, 581 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n          John      McGill   was    employed     by     Eastern    Shore   Printing\n\nCorporation    of    Virginia,      later      renamed    the     Interflex      Group\n\n(“Interflex”).      In May of 1992, McGill spoke with a broker, who\n\nsold insurance through appellee Minnesota Mutual Life Insurance\n\nCompany (“MML”), about obtaining disability insurance.\n\n          McGill applied for insurance that would have provided\n\nbenefits, if disabled, until he reached the age of 65.                        On his\n\napplication,   he    included      both    his   home    address    and    his    work\n\naddress, and indicated that he wished MML to send correspondence\n\nto his work address.\n\n          After he submitted his application, MML went through\n\nstandard procedures to determine coverage:                  It sent a nurse to\n\n                                      - 2 -\n\fhis office to perform a physical, and obtained McGill’s medical\n\nrecords.   On the basis of that information, MML chose not to\n\nissue a policy that would provide benefits until McGill reached\n\n65.   Instead,   MML   countered   the   offer   McGill   made   in   his\n\napplication by writing on the application a limited period of\n\nfive years of benefits.     On July 2, 1992, MML issued a policy\n\ncontaining the limited term of five years and sent it to McGill\n\nat his work address, as McGill had requested.\n\n           The human resources director at Interflex received and\n\nfiled a copy of the policy, and Interflex issued checks to pay\n\nMcGill’s premiums.     McGill has testified that he never saw the\n\npolicy that MML issued, and was unaware that the policy’s terms\n\ndiffered from his initial application.\n\n           In April of 1994, McGill was diagnosed with obstructive\n\nsleep apnea.   More than a year later, the condition had become so\n\nsevere that he was unable to continue working.      He entered into a\n\nseverance agreement with Interflex, and thereafter filed a claim\n\nfor disability benefits with MML.        It was only in 1996, while\n\ndiscussing this claim with MML, that McGill learned that the\n\npolicy had been issued with a five-year benefit cap.\n\n           MML paid McGill benefits under the policy for five\n\nyears and then terminated the payments.\n\n\n\n\n                               - 3 -\n\f               McGill    filed     the   instant      lawsuit    in    2005,       alleging\n\nbreach    of    contract,      misrepresentation,           fraud,     and    breach      of\n\nfiduciary duty.         The district court held that McGill’s policy did\n\nnot provide benefits until age 65, and granted summary judgment\n\nto MML.\n\n                                          II.\n\n               McGill claims that he did not personally receive the\n\nterms of the insurance contract, that his application should\n\ngovern the terms of the policy, and that he never consented to\n\nMML’s provision of a five-year benefit cap.\n\n               We must take as fact that McGill neither saw nor read\n\nthe   policy      terms.         Nevertheless,        the     July    2,    1992    policy\n\ncontaining the five-year limitation was sent to McGill at his\n\noffice address at MML as he requested.                   There is no dispute that\n\nMML mailed a copy of the July, 1992 policy and that McGill’s\n\nemployer,      Interflex,      retained     a    copy    in    its    files.        McGill\n\ntestified      that     he   did   not   ask    the     broker   who       sold    him   the\n\ninsurance policy to show him the policy.                       He never inquired of\n\nhis employer whether the policy had been delivered.\n\n               Even so, McGill claims that MML’s alteration cannot\n\nconstitute the terms of the policy.                     Under Virginia law, “[n]o\n\nalteration of any written application . . . shall be made by any\n\nperson other than the applicant without his written consent.”\n\n                                         - 4 -\n\fVa.   Code    §    38.2-3511.         McGill      claims   that       MML’s   handwritten\n\nchanges to his application were made without his consent, and\n\nwere thus ineffective and could not bind him.\n\n              We agree that under Virginia law, it appears McGill\n\ncould not be bound by MML’s handwritten changes.                        The question we\n\nmust resolve in this case, however, is not whether McGill was\n\nbound by the policy changes, but whether MML was bound to provide\n\ndisability benefits until McGill reached age 65.                         The conclusion\n\nto be drawn from this statute is not that MML must be held to the\n\nterms   for       which    McGill    initially      applied,      but    that    McGill’s\n\ninitial      offer    to       purchase    insurance       was    rejected      by   MML’s\n\ncounter-offer.            If    McGill    never    accepted      that    counter-offer,\n\nunder Virginia law, no meeting of the minds occurred and no\n\ncontract was formed.\n\n              Virginia         law   establishes      that       an    application     for\n\ninsurance is not itself a contract.                 Instead, “an application for\n\ninsurance is merely an offer to enter into a contract.                                 The\n\ninsurance policy is the contract between the parties.”                          Smith v.\n\nColonial Ins. Co. of Cal., 515 S.E.2d 775, 777 (Va. 1999); see\n\nalso Hayes v. Durham Life Ins. Co., 96 S.E.2d 109, 111 (Va. 1957)\n\n(“The application for insurance is a mere proposal for a contract\n\non the part of applicant.                It is one of two prerequisites in the\n\ncreation of the contract, the other consisting of the acceptance\n\n                                           - 5 -\n\fof the offer.        No contractual relationship exists between the\n\nparties until acceptance by the insurer. . . .”).\n\n            McGill’s application for insurance, then, did not by\n\nitself establish coverage; he offered to purchase coverage at a\n\ngiven     price.      In   order   to     form    a    contract,    McGill     must\n\ndemonstrate that the insurer accepted his offer.                    There is no\n\nevidence     that    the     insurer    did    so.      Instead,     the     record\n\nunequivocally       demonstrates       that    MML    responded    to      McGill’s\n\napplication with a more limited counter-offer.\n\n            The undisputed facts establish that MML did not accept\n\nMcGill’s initial offer to buy coverage until age 65.                      At most,\n\nMML proceeded on the assumption that it was required to provide\n\nno more than five years of disability benefits.                   McGill has not\n\nestablished that MML agreed to provide coverage for a longer\n\nperiod.\n\n                                        III.\n\n            Because    the    district    court      properly   granted    summary\n\njudgment to MML on the grounds that McGill’s insurance contract\n\ndid not provide benefits until age 65, we need not rule on MML’s\n\nalternate grounds for summary judgment.\n\n            AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 6 -\n\f",

Instead,     the     record\n\nunequivocally       demonstrates       that    MML    responded    to      McGill’s\n\napplication with a more limited counter-offer.\n\n            The undisputed facts establish that MML did not accept\n\nMcGill’s initial offer to buy coverage until age 65.                      At most,\n\nMML proceeded on the assumption that it was required to provide\n\nno more than five years of disability benefits.                   McGill has not\n\nestablished that MML agreed to provide coverage for a longer\n\nperiod.\n\n                                        III.\n\n            Because    the    district    court      properly   granted    summary\n\njudgment to MML on the grounds that McGill’s insurance contract\n\ndid not provide benefits until age 65, we need not rule on MML’s\n\nalternate grounds for summary judgment.\n\n            AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 6 -\n\f</pre>",
