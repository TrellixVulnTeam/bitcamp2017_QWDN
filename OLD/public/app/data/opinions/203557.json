This is an appeal from a\n\njudgment    of    the   district    court   granting    a   motion     to   dismiss\n\nplaintiffs’ action against UNUM Life Insurance Company of America\n\n(“UNUM”).    Plaintiffs Roy Mogel, Todd D. Lindsay and Joseph R.\n\nThorley, who are beneficiaries under employee welfare benefit\n\nplans, brought this action on behalf of themselves and a class of\n\nbeneficiaries.      They allege breaches of fiduciary duties under the\n\nEmployee         Retirement        Income      Security         Act    (“ERISA”),\n\n29 U.S.C. §§ 1104(a)(4) and 1106(b).                 Because we conclude that\n\nplaintiffs have stated a valid claim under ERISA, we vacate the\n\njudgment and remand for further proceedings.\n\n\n\n                     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n            The district court dismissed the complaint for failure to\n\nstate a claim.      Our review is therefore de novo.            Centra Medico del\n\nTurabo v. Feliciano de Melecio, 405 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2005).                   We\n\nassume the truth of all well pleaded facts.               Id.\n\n            The complaint alleges that plaintiffs were beneficiaries1\n\nof group life insurance policies issued by UNUM.2                 These policies\n\nare   “employee     welfare   benefit       plans”    within     the   meaning   of\n\n\n      1\n        29 U.S.C. § 1002(8) defines “beneficiary” as a “person\ndesignated by a participant, or by the terms of an employee benefit\nplan, who is or may become entitled to a benefit thereunder.”\n      2\n        The claims arise under policies issued to Xerox Imaging\nSystems, Inc., Sideshow USA and South Shore Mental Health Center,\nInc.\n\n                                       - 2 -\n\f29 U.S.C. § 1002(1) and (3).      Under 29 U.S.C. § 1002(21)(A),             UNUM\n\nis a fiduciary with respect to the policies.           The policies provide\n\nthat “all benefits payable . . . will be paid as soon as the\n\nInsurance Company receives proof of claim acceptable to it” and\n\n“[u]nless otherwise elected, payment for loss of life will be made\n\nin one lump sum.”      Plaintiffs submitted valid claims for death\n\nbenefits to UNUM in accordance with the terms of the             policies.    In\n\nresponse, UNUM approved the claims and mailed each plaintiff a\n\ncheckbook and a letter.       The letter advised that (1) plaintiffs’\n\ndeath benefits plus applicable interest had been deposited in a\n\nUNUM Security Account, (2) plaintiffs could write checks from $250\n\nup to the balance in the account, and (3) interest would be paid on\n\nthe accounts at a variable rate.\n\n            In this action plaintiffs charge that UNUM breached its\n\nfiduciary duties in two respects:       by failing to tender a full lump\n\nsum   payment   for   the   amount    of     the   claim   in    violation    of\n\n29 U.S.C. § 1104(a)(1) which requires that “a fiduciary shall\n\ndischarge his duties with respect to a plan solely in the interest\n\nof    the   participants    and   beneficiaries,”      and      by   wrongfully\n\nconverting to its own use and benefit the claim amounts owed to\n\nplaintiffs in violation of 29 U.S.C. § 1106(b)(1) which prohibits\n\na fiduciary with respect to a plan to “deal with the assets of the\n\nplan in his own interest.”\n\n            The district court granted UNUM’s motion to dismiss the\n\n\n                                     - 3 -\n\faction.         It    held   that   either   UNUM’s     Security   Accounts      were\n\n“separate accounts” as defined in 29 U.S.C. § 1002(17)3 in which\n\ncase “they were, by definition, credited with all gains and losses\n\nfrom the assets in those Accounts and the Plaintiffs cannot allege\n\na breach of fiduciary duty.”4           540 F. Supp. 2d 258, 265 (D. Mass.\n\n2008).        Alternatively, if the Security Accounts were not “separate\n\naccounts,” they fell within the guaranteed benefit exemption under\n\n29 U.S.C. § 1101(b)(2)(B).5           Id.    This timely appeal followed.         We\n\nhave        subject   matter   jurisdiction     under   28   U.S.C.   §   1331   and\n\n29 U.S.C. § 1132(e), and appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §\n\n1291.\n\n\n\n                                      ANALYSIS\n\n                The question we must decide is whether UNUM acted as an\n\n\n       3\n        29 U.S.C. § 1002(17) states: “The term ‘separate account’\nmeans an account established or maintained by an insurance company\nunder which income, gains, and losses, whether or not realized,\nfrom assets allocated to such account, are, in accordance with the\napplicable contract, credited to or charged against such account\nwithout regard to other income, gains, or losses of the insurance\ncompany.”\n       4\n       Because UNUM does not claim that the Security Accounts were\n“separate accounts,” we do not reach this portion of the district\ncourt’s holding.\n        5\n        29 U.S.C. § 1101(b)(2)(B) states: “The term ‘guaranteed\nbenefit policy’ means an insurance policy or contract to the extent\nthat such policy or contract provides for benefits the amount of\nwhich is guaranteed by the insurer. Such term includes any surplus\nin a separate account, but excludes any other portion of a separate\naccount.”\n\n\n                                        - 4 -\n\fERISA fiduciary when, by establishing the Security Accounts, it\n\nretained and invested death benefits presently due beneficiaries\n\nunder   UNUM’s    ERISA    plan   and     not   paid   until   drawn   down   as\n\nbeneficiaries wrote checks on their Security Accounts.\n\n              UNUM contends first that the conduct that is the subject\n\nof this appeal had nothing to do with UNUM’s fiduciary function and\n\ncould   not    have   occurred    until    after   that   function     had   been\n\nperformed.      It argues that it       acted as a fiduciary under UNUM’s\n\nbenefit plan when it determined that plaintiffs were entitled to\n\nbenefits.     But it then performed the non-discretionary ministerial\n\ntask of “paying the benefits,” giving plaintiffs full power to use\n\nthe funds as they saw fit.\n\n              UNUM’s contention rests on quicksand. The district court\n\nfound, and we agree, that delivery of the checkbook did not\n\nconstitute a “lump sum payment” called for by the policies.              As the\n\ndistrict court put it, “[t]he difference between delivery of a\n\ncheck and a checkbook . . . is the difference between UNUM\n\nretaining or UNUM divesting possession of Plaintiffs’ funds.”                 540\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 262.       Thus UNUM cannot be said to have completed its\n\nfiduciary functions under the plan when it set up the Security\n\nAccounts and mailed the checkbooks, retaining for its use the funds\n\ndue until they were withdrawn.          UNUM’s theory that its mailing of\n\nthe checkbooks to the beneficiaries and their acceptance formed a\n\nunilateral contract is unpersuasive, for until the beneficiaries\n\n\n                                    - 5 -\n\freceived the lump sum payments to which they were entitled, UNUM\n\nremained obligated to carry out its fiduciary duty under the plan.\n\n               More importantly, when UNUM says that plaintiffs had been\n\npaid,       referring   to   “the    sums   already   deemed    to   belong    to\n\nPlaintiffs,” it obscures            reality.   Until a beneficiary draws a\n\ncheck on the Security Account, the funds represented by that check\n\nare retained by UNUM and UNUM had the use of the funds for its own\n\nbenefit.6       To say that the funds are “deemed to belong” to the\n\nbeneficiaries obscures the reality that UNUM had possession of them\n\nand enjoyed their use.        Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Vega, 174 F.3d\n\n870, 872-73 (7th Cir. 1999), is squarely on point.               In that case,\n\nIllinois sought to apply its Uniform Disposition of Unclaimed\n\nProperty Act to funds payable under Com Ed’s pension plan but not\n\nyet claimed by a plan beneficiary.              The plan issued checks to\n\nbeneficiaries which frequently were not cashed or deposited.                  The\n\nSeventh Circuit held that ERISA preempted the Act, reasoning that\n\n“until the check to the beneficiary is actually presented               to the\n\nplan for payment through the banking system, and paid, the money\n\ndue to the beneficiary is an asset of the plan.”               Id. at 873.     So\n\nhere the sums due plaintiffs remain plan assets subject to UNUM’s\n\nfiduciary obligations until actual payment.\n\n\n        6\n       While UNUM says it paid an agreed amount of interest to the\nbeneficiaries, the crux of appellants’ claim is that UNUM failed to\ncredit the accounts with the full amount UNUM earned investing the\nfunds. Because this case is still at the dismissal stage, we must\naccept the appellants’ argument as being true.\n\n                                       - 6 -\n\f            As a second string to its bow, UNUM advances the argument\n\nthat even if its use of the beneficiaries’ funds were subject to\n\nERISA’s fiduciary duties, “Congress,” it says, “chose to exempt\n\ninsurers    from fiduciary duties in their handling of funds used to\n\npay guaranteed ERISA benefits.”        Again, UNUM paints with too broad\n\na brush.\n\n            The guaranteed benefit policy exemption by its terms does\n\nnot exempt insurers from fiduciary duties.            What it does is to\n\nexclude an insurance policy from plan assets “to the extent that\n\nsuch policy . . . provides for benefits the amount of which is\n\nguaranteed by the insurer.” 29 U.S.C. §1101(b)(2)(B). Speaking of\n\nthis provision, the Supreme Court has observed:\n\n            [E]ven were we not inclined, generally, to\n            tight reading of exemptions from comprehensive\n            schemes of this kind, . . . Congress has\n            specifically instructed, by the words of\n            limitation it used, that we closely contain\n            the guaranteed benefit policy exclusion.\n\n\nJohn Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Harris Trust & Sav. Bank, 510\n\nU.S. 86, 97 (1993) (internal citations omitted).             That exemption\n\n(or exclusion) was intended to free insurance companies from the\n\npotential conflict between managing plan assets for the benefit of\n\nparticipants and beneficiaries, on one hand, and, on the other, the\n\noperation of the insurer’s general account which requires the\n\nequitable   spreading   of   risks    among   all   policy   holders.   See\n\nTrustees of Laborers’ Local No.72 Pension Fund v. Nationwide Life\n\n\n                                     - 7 -\n\fIns. Co., 783 F. Supp. 899, 904 n.7 (D.N.J. 1992).               It does not\n\nalter the fiduciary duties imposed on an insurer with respect to\n\nthe management and administration of a plan as opposed to the\n\noversight   of   investment   policy    and   has   no     application     here.\n\nSpecifically, once an insured’s death occurs, we are no longer\n\nconcerned with the management of plan assets in an insurance\n\ncompany’s general account (which is all the guaranteed benefit\n\nexemption covers) but rather with the insurance company’s duties\n\nwith respect to the payment that is now due the beneficiary.               ERISA\n\nspells out those duties, providing that a person is a fiduciary\n\nwith respect to an employee benefit plan\n\n            to   the   extent   (i)   he   exercises   any\n            discretionary   authority   or   discretionary\n            control respecting management of such plan or\n            exercises any authority or control respecting\n            management or disposition of its assets, . . .\n            (iii) he has any discretionary authority or\n            discretionary     responsibility     in    the\n            administration of such plan.\n\n\n29 U.S.C. § 1002(21)(A).      UNUM’s disposition to the beneficiaries\n\nof benefits under the plan falls comfortably within the scope of\n\nERISA’s   definition   of   fiduciary    duties     with    respect   to    plan\n\nadministration.     See Varity Corp. v. Howe, 516 U.S. 489, 502\n\n(1996).\n\n\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n            In sum, the euphemistically named “Security Account,”\n\n\n                                  - 8 -\n\faccompanied with a checkbook, was no more than an IOU which did not\n\ntransfer the funds to which the beneficiaries were entitled out of\n\nthe plan assets and hence UNUM remained a fiduciary with respect to\n\nthose funds.\n\n          Because plaintiffs have stated a viable claim of breach\n\nof fiduciary duties, we need go no further to address their\n\nmisrepresentation claim.\n\n          Vacated and remanded.   No costs are awarded.\n\n\n\n\n                              - 9 -\n\f",

Plaintiffs Roy Mogel, Todd D. Lindsay and Joseph R. Thorley, who are beneficiaries under employee welfare benefit plans, brought this action on behalf of themselves and a class of beneficiaries. They allege breaches of fiduciary duties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\"), 29 U.S.C. §§ 1104(a)(4) and 1106(b). Because we conclude that plaintiffs have stated a valid claim under ERISA, we vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim. Our <span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> review is therefore de novo. <i>Centro Medico del Turabo v. Feliciano de Melecio,</i> 406 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2005). We assume the truth of all well pleaded facts. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The complaint alleges that plaintiffs were beneficiaries<sup>[1]</sup> of group life insurance policies issued by UNUM.<sup>[2]</sup> These policies are \"employee welfare benefit plans\" within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. § 1002(1) and (3). Under 29 U.S.C. § 1002(21)(A), UNUM is a fiduciary with respect to the policies. The policies provide that \"all benefits payable ... will be paid as soon as the Insurance Company receives proof of claim acceptable to it\" and \"[u]nless otherwise elected, payment for loss of life will be made in one lump sum.\" Plaintiffs submitted valid claims for death benefits to UNUM in accordance with the terms of the policies. In response, UNUM approved the claims and mailed each plaintiff a checkbook and a letter. The letter advised that (1) plaintiffs' death benefits plus applicable interest had been deposited in a UNUM Security Account, (2) plaintiffs could write checks from $250 up to the balance in the account, and (3) interest would be paid on the accounts at a variable rate.</p>\n<p>In this action plaintiffs charge that UNUM breached its fiduciary duties in two respects: by failing to tender a full lump sum payment for the amount of the claim in violation of 29 U.S.C. § 1104(a)(1) which requires that \"a fiduciary shall discharge his duties with respect to a plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries,\" and by wrongfully converting to its own use and benefit the claim amounts owed to plaintiffs in violation of 29 U.S.C. § 1106(b)(1) which prohibits a fiduciary with respect to a plan to \"deal with the assets of the plan in his own interest.\"</p>\n<p>The district court granted UNUM's motion to dismiss the action. It held that either UNUM's Security Accounts were \"separate accounts\" as defined in 29 U.S.C. § 1002(17)<sup>[3]</sup> in which case \"they were, by definition, credited with all gains and losses from the assets in those Accounts and the Plaintiffs cannot allege a breach of fiduciary duty.\"<sup>[4]</sup> 540 F.Supp.2d 258, 265 (D.Mass.2008). Alternatively, if the Security Accounts were not \"separate accounts,\" they fell within the guaranteed benefit exemption under 29 U.S.C. § 1101(b)(2)(B).<sup>[5]</sup><i>Id.</i> This timely appeal followed.

Thus UNUM cannot be said to have completed its fiduciary functions under the plan when it set up the Security Accounts and mailed the checkbooks, retaining for its use the funds due until they were withdrawn.

That exemption (or exclusion) was intended to free insurance companies from the potential conflict between managing plan assets for the benefit of participants and beneficiaries, on one hand, and, on the other, the operation of the insurer's general account which requires the equitable spreading of risks among all policy holders. <i>See </i><i>Trustees of Laborers' Local No.72 Pension Fund v. Nationwide Life Ins. Co.,</i> 783 F.Supp. 899, 904 n. 7 (D.N.J.1992). It does not alter the fiduciary duties imposed on an insurer with respect to the management and administration of a plan as opposed to the oversight of investment policy and has no application here. Specifically, once an insured's death occurs, we are no longer concerned with the management of plan assets in an insurance company's general account (which is all the guaranteed benefit exemption covers) but rather with the insurance company's duties with respect to the payment that is now due the beneficiary. ERISA spells out those duties, providing that a person is a fiduciary with respect to an employee benefit plan</p>\n<blockquote>to the extent (i) he exercises any discretionary authority or discretionary control respecting management of such plan or exercises any authority or control respecting management or disposition of its assets, ... (iii) he has any discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the administration of such plan.</blockquote>\n<p>29 U.S.C. § 1002(21)(A). UNUM's disposition to the beneficiaries of benefits under the plan falls comfortably within the scope of ERISA's definition of fiduciary duties with respect to plan administration. <i>See </i><i>Varity Corp. v.

Plaintiffs Roy Mogel, Todd D. Lindsay and Joseph R. Thorley, who are beneficiaries under employee welfare benefit plans, brought this action on behalf of themselves and a class of beneficiaries. They allege breaches of fiduciary duties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\"), 29 U.S.C. §§ 1104(a)(4) and 1106(b). Because we conclude that plaintiffs have stated a valid claim under ERISA, we vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim. Our <span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> review is therefore de novo. <i>Centro Medico del Turabo v. Feliciano de Melecio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201545\"><a href=\"/opinion/201545/centro-medico-del-v-feliciano-de-melecio/\"><span class=\"volume\">406</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.2005). We assume the truth of all well pleaded facts. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The complaint alleges that plaintiffs were beneficiaries<sup>[1]</sup> of group life insurance policies issued by UNUM.<sup>[2]</sup> These policies are \"employee welfare benefit plans\" within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. § 1002(1) and (3). Under 29 U.S.C. § 1002(21)(A), UNUM is a fiduciary with respect to the policies. The policies provide that \"all benefits payable ... will be paid as soon as the Insurance Company receives proof of claim acceptable to it\" and \"[u]nless otherwise elected, payment for loss of life will be made in one lump sum.\" Plaintiffs submitted valid claims for death benefits to UNUM in accordance with the terms of the policies. In response, UNUM approved the claims and mailed each plaintiff a checkbook and a letter. The letter advised that (1) plaintiffs' death benefits plus applicable interest had been deposited in a UNUM Security Account, (2) plaintiffs could write checks from $250 up to the balance in the account, and (3) interest would be paid on the accounts at a variable rate.</p>\n<p>In this action plaintiffs charge that UNUM breached its fiduciary duties in two respects: by failing to tender a full lump sum payment for the amount of the claim in violation of 29 U.S.C. § 1104(a)(1) which requires that \"a fiduciary shall discharge his duties with respect to a plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries,\" and by wrongfully converting to its own use and benefit the claim amounts owed to plaintiffs in violation of 29 U.S.C. § 1106(b)(1) which prohibits a fiduciary with respect to a plan to \"deal with the assets of the plan in his own interest.\"</p>\n<p>The district court granted UNUM's motion to dismiss the action. It held that either UNUM's Security Accounts were \"separate accounts\" as defined in 29 U.S.C. § 1002(17)<sup>[3]</sup> in which case \"they were, by definition, credited with all gains and losses from the assets in those Accounts and the Plaintiffs cannot allege a breach of fiduciary duty.\"<sup>[4]</sup> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1611669\"><a href=\"/opinion/1611669/mogel-v-unum-life-ins-co-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">258</span></a></span>, 265 (D.Mass.2008). Alternatively, if the Security Accounts were not \"separate accounts,\" they fell within the guaranteed benefit exemption under 29 U.S.C. § 1101(b)(2)(B).<sup>[5]</sup><i>Id.</i> This timely appeal followed. We have subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 29 U.S.C. § 1132(e), and appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*26</span> ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>The question we must decide is whether UNUM acted as an ERISA fiduciary when, by establishing the Security Accounts, it retained and invested death benefits presently due beneficiaries under UNUM's ERISA plan and not paid until drawn down as beneficiaries wrote checks on their Security Accounts.</p>\n<p>UNUM contends first that the conduct that is the subject of this appeal had nothing to do with UNUM's fiduciary function and could not have occurred until after that function had been performed. It argues that it acted as a fiduciary under UNUM's benefit plan when it determined that plaintiffs were entitled to benefits. But it then performed the non-discretionary ministerial task of \"paying the benefits,\" giving plaintiffs full power to use the funds as they saw fit.</p>\n<p>UNUM's contention rests on quicksand. The district court found, and we agree, that delivery of the checkbook did not constitute a \"lump sum payment\" called for by the policies. As the district court put it, \"[t]he difference between delivery of a check and a checkbook ... is the difference between UNUM retaining or UNUM divesting possession of Plaintiffs' funds.\" 540 F.Supp.2d at 262. Thus UNUM cannot be said to have completed its fiduciary functions under the plan when it set up the Security Accounts and mailed the checkbooks, retaining for its use the funds due until they were withdrawn. UNUM's theory that its mailing of the checkbooks to the beneficiaries and their acceptance formed a unilateral contract is unpersuasive, for until the beneficiaries received the lump sum payments to which they were entitled, UNUM remained obligated to carry out its fiduciary duty under the plan.</p>\n<p>More importantly, when UNUM says that plaintiffs had been paid, referring to \"the sums already deemed to belong to Plaintiffs,\" it obscures reality. Until a beneficiary draws a check on the Security Account, the funds represented by that check are retained by UNUM and UNUM had the use of the funds for its own benefit.<sup>[6]</sup> To say that the funds are \"deemed to belong\" to the beneficiaries obscures the reality that UNUM had possession of them and enjoyed their use. <i>Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Vega,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763508\"><a href=\"/opinion/763508/22-employee-benefits-cas-2794-pens-plan-guide-cch-p-23954/\"><span class=\"volume\">174</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">870</span></a></span>, 872-73 (7th Cir.1999), is squarely on point. In that case, Illinois sought to apply its Uniform Disposition of Unclaimed Property Act to funds payable under Com Ed's pension plan but not yet claimed by a plan beneficiary. The plan issued checks to beneficiaries which frequently were not cashed or deposited. The Seventh Circuit held that ERISA preempted the Act, reasoning that \"until the check to the beneficiary is actually presented to the plan for payment through the banking system, and paid, the money due to the beneficiary is an asset of the plan.\" <i>Id.</i> at 873. So here the sums due plaintiffs remain plan assets subject to UNUM's fiduciary obligations until actual payment.</p>\n<p>As a second string to its bow, UNUM advances the argument that even if its use of the beneficiaries' funds were subject to ERISA's fiduciary duties, \"Congress,\" it says, \"chose to exempt insurers from fiduciary duties in their handling of funds used to pay guaranteed ERISA benefits.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*27</span> Again, UNUM paints with too broad a brush.</p>\n<p>The guaranteed benefit policy exemption by its terms does not exempt insurers from fiduciary duties. What it does is to exclude an insurance policy from plan assets \"to the extent that such policy... provides for benefits the amount of which is guaranteed by the insurer.\" 29 U.S.C. § 1101(b)(2)(B). Speaking of this provision, the Supreme Court has observed:</p>\n<blockquote>[E]ven were we not inclined, generally, to tight reading of exemptions from comprehensive schemes of this kind, ... Congress has specifically instructed, by the words of limitation it used, that we closely contain the guaranteed benefit policy exclusion.</blockquote>\n<p><i>John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co. v.
