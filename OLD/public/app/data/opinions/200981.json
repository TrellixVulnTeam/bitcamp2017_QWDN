Hayhow for appellant.\n     Donald C. Lockhart, Assistant United States Attorney with whom\nCraig N. Moore, Acting United States Attorney and Andrew J. Reich,\nAssistant United States Attorney were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          April 29, 2004\n\f           HOWARD, Circuit Judge.                     In this appeal, we decide\n\nwhether the district court permissibly applied an upward departure\n\nin sentencing Cesar Moreno for bail jumping to avoid prosecution on\n\nseveral civil rights charges.              We vacate the sentence and remand\n\nfor resentencing.\n\n                                          I.\n\n           On October 6, 1998, Moreno and three others were indicted\n\nby a federal grand jury on eight civil rights offenses.1                        See 18\n\nU.S.C. §§ 241, 242.            The next day Moreno was arraigned, at which\n\ntime the district court released him on bond and advised him of his\n\nobligation to appear at all subsequent court proceedings.                            The\n\ncourt also limited Moreno's travel to Massachusetts and Rhode\n\nIsland and ordered him to surrender his Colombian passport. Moreno\n\nfalsely    told        the     court    that    he     had   lost     his     passport.\n\nApproximately three months later, he flew to Colombia.\n\n               While     Moreno    remained      in    Colombia,      the    government\n\nproceeded with the prosecution of Moreno's co-defendants.                       In May\n\n1999,    the     other       defendants   were       acquitted   of    all    charges.\n\nApproximately      four       years    after   his    disappearance,        Moreno   was\n\narrested in New York on the still-pending civil rights indictment.\n\nAs part of a plea agreement, Moreno pleaded guilty to a one-count\n\ninformation of knowingly and willfully failing to appear for a\n\n\n     1\n       The underlying indictment derived from Moreno's role as an\ninformant for the Rhode Island Attorney General's drug strike\nforce.\n\n                                          -2-\n\fcourt proceeding, see 18 U.S.C. § 3146(a)(1) (the \"bail jumping\n\nstatute\"), and the government moved to dismiss the underlying civil\n\nrights indictment.\n\n          Applying U.S.S.G. § 2J1.6, Moreno's probation officer\n\nsubmitted a presentence investigation report (\"PSR\") recommending\n\nan offense level of 10, which yielded a sentencing range of 6 to 12\n\nmonths of imprisonment.   The PSR did not recommend any departures,\n\nand neither side objected to the PSR's contents.\n\n          At   Moreno's   sentencing   hearing,   the   district   court\n\nnotified the parties that, despite the PSR recommendation, it was\n\nconsidering sentencing Moreno above the guideline range.           After\n\nallowing an opportunity for briefing, the court reconvened the\n\nsentencing hearing and departed upward from offense level 10 to\n\nlevel 13, which resulted in Moreno receiving an 18 month term of\n\nincarceration.   The district court premised the departure on the\n\neffect that Moreno's decision to flee had on the operation of the\n\njudicial system.2\n\n                                 II.\n\n          Moreno challenges the upward departure because, in his\n\nview, the departure rationale offered by the district court does\n\nnot remove this case from the \"heartland\" established by U.S.S.G.\n\n\n     2\n       The district court also stated that it was unfair that\nMoreno's sentence for bail jumping would be substantially less than\nthe statutory maximum he would have faced for the underlying civil\nrights offenses. On appeal, the government has conceded that this\nadditional ground is not a valid basis for departure.\n\n                                 -3-\n\f§ 2J1.6.    We review Moreno's challenge under the recently enacted\n\nProsecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of\n\nChildren Today Act of 2003 (\"PROTECT Act\").                       See 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3742(e); United States v. Thurston, 358 F.3d 51, 71-72 (1st Cir.\n\n2004); United States v. Frazier, 340 F.3d 5, 14 (1st Cir. 2003)\n\n(holding that the PROTECT Act applies to appellate review of upward\n\ndepartures).\n\n            In reviewing a departure under the PROTECT Act, we first\n\ndetermine   de novo    whether        the   basis     for   departing      is   either\n\ninconsistent    with     the    objectives       of     federal     sentencing       as\n\narticulated in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2) or not authorized by 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3553(b).      See 18 U.S.C. § 3742(e)(3)(B)(i-ii); Thurston,\n\n358 F.3d at 70.     If we deem the departing rationale appropriate, we\n\nthen determine de novo if the facts of the instant case justify\n\ndeparting    from    the     guideline        range.3        See    18     U.S.C.     §\n\n3742(e)(3)(B)(iii); Thurston, 358 F.3d at 70.\n\n            Consistent     with   Thurston,      we     first     ask    whether    the\n\ndistrict court correctly identified as a departing rationale \"an\n\naggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind or to a degree,\n\nnot   adequately     taken     into    consideration         by    the    Sentencing\n\nCommission in formulating the guidelines.\"                  18 U.S.C. § 3553(b);\n\nU.S.S.G. § 5K2.0.       Because criminal sentencing \"encompasses the\n\n\n      3\n       Prior to the enactment of the PROTECT Act, this second\nquestion was reviewed only for clear error. See United States v.\nChapman, 241 F.3d 57, 63 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n                                        -4-\n\fvast range of human conduct,\" the Commission did not place many\n\nlimitations on the factors that a court could consider in departing\n\nfrom the guideline range.      U.S.S.G. ch. 1 pt. A 4(b).       But while\n\nthe universe of possible departure factors is broad, there are\n\nboundaries.   Certain factors are off limits because the Commission\n\nhas determined that they never could justify a departure.                See\n\nUnited States v. Perez, 160 F.3d 87, 89 (1st Cir. 1998) (listing\n\nforbidden departure factors).         Other factors are impermissible\n\nbecause the Commission adequately considered them in establishing\n\nthe guidelines or because they are inconsistent with the structure\n\nand theory of the guidelines.         See United States v. Martin, 221\n\nF.3d 52, 57 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n          The   district    court's   basis   for   departing   upward   in\n\nsentencing Moreno was the effect that Moreno's conduct had on the\n\nefficient operation of the judicial system.         In articulating this\n\nrationale, the district court noted \"several components\" that could\n\nlead to a sufficiently large disruption to warrant a departure: (1)\n\nthe nature of the proceeding at which the defendant failed to\n\nappear (trial or pretrial); (2) the nature of the underlying case\n\nagainst the defendant (single or multi defendant); and (3) the\n\nlength of the defendant's absence.\n\n          Under   the      guidelines,   substantially     disrupting     a\n\ngovernmental function is a favored ground for departing.                 See\n\nU.S.S.G. § 5K2.7; United States v. Anderson, 353 F.3d 490, 510 (6th\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fCir. 2003) (\"conduct that significantly disrupted . . . judicial\n\nfunction\" is ground for upward departure under U.S.S.G. § 5K2.7).\n\nBut   a   departure   on    this     basis   is     only   appropriate    if   the\n\ninterference with     \"governmental function is [not] inherent in the\n\noffense.\" U.S.S.G. § 5K2.7; see United States v. Sarault, 975 F.2d\n\n17, 19-20 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n            One of the factors that the district court identified as\n\nfavoring a departure is the additional burden placed on the justice\n\nsystem by a defendant who is absent for his trial.                 As the court\n\nexplained, a defendant who fails to appear for only a pretrial\n\nproceeding    \"does   not    have     the    same    impact   on   the   judicial\n\nproceeding [as a defendant who] fail[s] to appear at the time of\n\ntrial.\"\n\n            From   our     vantage    point,      the    difficulty   with     this\n\nrationale, at least as an independent basis for departing, is that\n\na defendant failing to appear for trial is a factor that was\n\nalready considered by the Commission in establishing the sentencing\n\nexposure for bail jumping.           The legislative history of the bail\n\njumping statute demonstrates that Congress enacted the law with an\n\neye toward punishing defendants who abscond with such an intent.\n\nThe Senate Report states that one of the purposes of the statute is\n\n\"to deter those who would obstruct law enforcement by failing\n\nknowingly to appear for trial . . . .\"                  See S. Rep. No. 98-225,\n\nreprinted in 1984 U.S.S.C.A.N. 3182, 3213 (emphasis supplied).                  It\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fis hard to imagine that the Commission failed to consider a\n\ndefendant   who   fails   to    appear     for   trial   in   developing   the\n\n\"heartland\" for this offense.       See Koon v. United States, 518 U.S.\n\n81, 94 (1996) (stating that each guideline is intended to apply to\n\na \"heartland of typical cases\");           United States v. Sarna, 28 F.3d\n\n657, 660 (7th Cir. 1994) (stating that a factor common to many bail\n\njumping cases cannot be a proper basis for departure).\n\n            This is not to say, however, that the defendant's failure\n\nto appear for trial will never have an atypically disruptive effect\n\non the judicial process.       The government may not try a defendant if\n\nhe is not present on the date that his trial commences.            See Crosby\n\nv. United States, 506 U.S. 255, 259-60 (1993) (stating that Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 43 prevents trial in absentia if the defendant is not\n\npresent at the beginning of trial).          The government's inability to\n\nproceed against an absent defendant could cause a substantial\n\ndisruption in the administration of justice if the government is\n\nmaterially prejudiced in its ability to prosecute the underlying\n\noffense after the defendant is found:            witnesses could disappear\n\nand evidence could become so stale that it would be more difficult\n\nfor the government to prosecute at a later date.\n\n            Moreover, the burdens caused by a defendant failing to\n\nappear for his trial could be even more pronounced in a multi-\n\ndefendant prosecution.     In addition to the possible disappearance\n\nof witnesses and the loss of evidence, the defendant may obtain a\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fdistinct advantage over the government by absconding in a multi-\n\ndefendant     case.      If   the   government    proceeds   against    the   co-\n\ndefendants before the defendant is found, the defendant can assess\n\nthe strengths and weaknesses of the government's case before\n\nreturning for his own trial.          Moreover, the defendant could create\n\nadditional impediments to the government's ability to prosecute the\n\nco-defendants.        The co-defendants could attempt to shift the blame\n\nfrom themselves to the absent defendant.              Further, the defendant\n\nmay place additional burdens on the court because, in many cases,\n\nthe   court     will     either     have     to   conduct    multiple    trials\n\nunnecessarily, cf. United States v. Flinn, 987 F.2d 1497, 1505\n\n(10th Cir. 1993) (holding that unnecessary deployment of government\n\nresource is basis for upward departure), or wait an indeterminate\n\nlength for the capture of the defendant to conduct a single trial,\n\nsee United States v. Hastings, 847 F.2d 920, 923 (1st Cir. 1988)\n\n(observing that \"justice delayed is justice denied\").\n\n            The district court also emphasized the length of the\n\ndefendant's absence. For many of the reasons just articulated, the\n\nlength of the absence can be relevant to determining the extent to\n\nwhich the defendant's conduct disrupted the judicial process.                 The\n\nlonger the absence, the more likely it is that the government will\n\nhave difficulty prosecuting the defendant on his return.                       In\n\naddition by absenting himself, the defendant (if convicted) delays\n\nthe day on which he will ultimately face punishment.             Thus, a long\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fabsence would permit a guilty defendant to live for a substantial\n\nperiod in freedom.      See United States v. Cherry, 10 F.3d 1003,\n\n1009-10 (3d Cir. 1993) (affirming imposition of upward departure\n\nwhere, inter alia, defendant was absent for 20 years).\n\n            In this case, Moreno absented himself for four years, and\n\nundoubtedly would have continued that state of affairs had he not\n\nbeen arrested in New York.        Conceivably, the length of his absence\n\nhad   an   unusually   negative    impact       on    the   functioning   of   the\n\njudicial process, but there have been no findings to this effect.\n\nSee 18 U.S.C. § 3553(c) (under PROTECT Act district court required\n\nto    provide   written   statement        of        findings   justifying     the\n\ndeparture).     While a 20 year absence would surely be atypical, we\n\nare not prepared to say, based on the slender record before us,\n\nthat the four-year absence here is outside of the heartland.                   It\n\ndoes not seem obviously unusual that a defendant who absconds\n\nshortly after arraignment, with the intention of avoiding trial,\n\nmight well remain a fugitive for a few years.                   We are left to\n\nspeculate whether the duration of Moreno's absence had an unusual\n\nimpact, (beyond that already accounted for) contributing to the\n\ndisruption of the judicial process.                  More than speculation is\n\nrequired.\n\n            In sum, we conclude that one of the component factors,\n\ncreating a need for multiple trials             –- relied on by the district\n\ncourt in its disruption analysis, supports the departure ordered\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fin this case.    Two other factors mentioned by the court should not\n\nhave been relied on, except insofar as they support the multiple\n\ntrial analysis:    that a defendant might miss trial rather than a\n\npre-trial    hearing      has   been   adequately     considered   by   the\n\nCommission, and the record before us does not sufficiently explain\n\nhow Moreno's four-year absence takes this case outside of the\n\nheartland.     As we are unsure what sentence the district court\n\nwould have imposed had it the benefit of our opinion, we vacate\n\nthe sentence and remand to allow the court to reimpose sentence,\n\ncertain that the court will act promptly.           See Williams v. United\n\nStates, 503 U.S. 193, 203 (1992). The district court may, of\n\ncourse, reaffirm its prior sentence or impose another lawful\n\nsentence.\n\n            So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\f",

But a departure on this basis is only appropriate if the interference with \"governmental function is [not] inherent in the offense.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.7; <i>see United States v.

As the court explained, a defendant who fails to appear for only a pretrial proceeding \"does not have the same impact on the judicial proceeding [as a defendant who] fail[s] to appear at the time of trial.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From our vantage point, the difficulty with this rationale, at least as an independent basis for departing, is that a defendant failing to appear for trial is a factor that was already considered by the Commission in establishing the sentencing exposure for bail jumping. The legislative history of the bail jumping statute demonstrates that Congress enacted the law with an eye toward punishing defendants who abscond with such an intent. The Senate Report states that one of the purposes of the statute is \"to deter those who would obstruct law enforcement by failing knowingly to <i>appear for trial</i> ....\" <i>See</i> S.Rep. No. 98-225, <i>reprinted in</i> 1984 U.S.S.C.A.N. 3182, 3213 (emphasis supplied). It is hard to imagine that the Commission failed to consider a defendant who fails to appear for trial in developing the \"heartland\" for this offense. <i>See Koon v. United States,</i> 518 U.S. 81, 94, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996) (stating that each guideline is intended to apply to a \"heartland of typical cases\"); <i>United States v. Sarna,</i> 28 F.3d 657, 660 (7th Cir.1994) (stating that a factor common to many bail jumping cases cannot be a proper basis for departure).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not to say, however, that the defendant's failure to appear for trial will never have an atypically disruptive effect on the judicial process. The government may not try a defendant if he is not present on the date that his trial commences. <i>See Crosby v. United States,</i> 506 U.S. 255, 259-60, 113 S.Ct. 748, 122 L.Ed.2d 25 (1993) (stating that Fed.R.Crim.P. 43 prevents trial <i>in absentia</i> if the defendant is not present at the beginning of trial). The government's inability to proceed against an absent defendant could cause a substantial disruption in the administration of justice if the government is materially prejudiced in its ability to prosecute the underlying offense after the defendant is found: witnesses could disappear and evidence could become so stale that it would be more difficult for the government to prosecute at a later date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the burdens caused by a defendant failing to appear for his trial could be even more pronounced in a multi-defendant prosecution. In addition to the possible disappearance of witnesses and the loss of evidence, the defendant may obtain a distinct advantage over the government by absconding in a multi-defendant case. If the government proceeds against the co-defendants before the defendant is found, the defendant can assess the strengths and weaknesses of the government's case before returning for his own trial. Moreover, the defendant could create additional impediments to the government's ability to prosecute the co-defendants. The co-defendants could attempt to shift the blame from themselves to the absent defendant. Further, the defendant may place additional burdens on the court because, in many cases, the court will either have to conduct multiple trials unnecessarily, <i>cf. United States v. Flinn,</i> 987 F.2d 1497, 1505 (10th Cir.1993) (holding that unnecessary deployment of government resource is basis for upward departure), or wait an indeterminate length for the capture of the defendant to conduct a single trial, <i>see United States v. Hastings,</i> 847 F.2d 920, 923 (1st Cir.1988) (observing that \"justice delayed is justice denied\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also emphasized the length of the defendant's absence. For many of the reasons just articulated, the length of the absence can be relevant to determining the extent to which the defendant's conduct disrupted the judicial process. The longer the absence, the more likely it is that the government will have difficulty prosecuting the defendant on his return. In addition by absenting himself, the defendant (if convicted) delays the day on which he will ultimately face punishment. Thus, a long absence would permit a guilty defendant to live for a substantial period in freedom. <i>See United</i> <i>States v. Cherry,</i> 10 F.3d 1003, 1009-10 (3d Cir.1993) (affirming imposition of upward departure where, <i>inter alia,</i> defendant was absent for 20 years).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, Moreno absented himself for four years, and undoubtedly would have continued that state of affairs had he not been arrested in New York. Conceivably, the length of his absence had an unusually negative impact on the functioning of the judicial process, but there have been no findings to this effect. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(c) (under PROTECT Act district court required to provide written statement of findings justifying the departure). While a 20 year absence would surely be atypical, we are not prepared to say, based on the slender record before us, that the four-year absence here is outside of the heartland. It does not seem obviously unusual that a defendant who absconds shortly after arraignment, with the intention of avoiding trial, might well remain a fugitive for a few years. We are left to speculate whether the duration of Moreno's absence had an unusual impact, (beyond that already accounted for) contributing to the disruption of the judicial process. More than speculation is required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we conclude that one of the component factors, creating a need for multiple trials &#8212; relied on by the district court in its disruption analysis, supports the departure ordered in this case. Two other factors mentioned by the court should not have been relied on, except insofar as they support the multiple trial analysis: that a defendant might miss trial rather than a pre-trial hearing has been adequately considered by the Commission, and the record before us does not sufficiently explain how Moreno's four-year absence takes this case outside of the heartland. As we are unsure what sentence the district court would have imposed had it the benefit of our opinion, we <i>vacate</i> the sentence and <i>remand</i> to allow the court to reimpose sentence, certain that the court will act promptly. <i>See Williams v. United States,</i> 503 U.S. 193, 203, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992).

The next day Moreno was arraigned, at which time the district court released him on bond and advised him of his obligation to appear at all subsequent court proceedings. The court also limited Moreno's travel to Massachusetts and Rhode Island and ordered him to surrender his Colombian passport. Moreno falsely told the court that he had lost his passport. Approximately three months later, he flew to Colombia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Moreno remained in Colombia, the government proceeded with the prosecution of Moreno's co-defendants. In May 1999, the other defendants were acquitted of all charges. Approximately four years after his disappearance, Moreno was arrested in New York on the still-pending civil rights indictment. As part of a plea agreement, Moreno pleaded guilty to a one-count information of knowingly and willfully failing to appear for a court proceeding, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3146(a)(1) (the \"bail jumping statute\"), and the government moved to dismiss the underlying civil rights indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying U.S.S.G. &#167; 2J1.6, Moreno's probation officer submitted a presentence investigation report (\"PSR\") recommending an offense level of 10, which yielded a sentencing range of 6 to 12 months of imprisonment.

After allowing an opportunity for briefing, the court reconvened the sentencing hearing and departed upward from offense level 10 to level 13, which resulted in Moreno receiving an 18 month term of incarceration. The district court premised the departure on the effect that Moreno's decision to flee had on the operation of the judicial system.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreno challenges the upward departure because, in his view, the departure rationale offered by the district court does not remove this case from the \"heartland\" established by U.S.S.G. &#167; 2J1.6.

Flinn,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"601868\"><a href=\"/opinion/601868/united-states-v-edward-scott-flinn/\"><span class=\"volume\">987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1497</span></a></span>, 1505 (10th Cir.1993) (holding that unnecessary deployment of government resource is basis for upward departure), or wait an indeterminate length for the capture of the defendant to conduct a single trial, <i>see United States v. Hastings,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"506587\"><a href=\"/opinion/506587/united-states-v-kenneth-s-hastings/\"><span class=\"volume\">847</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">920</span></a></span>, 923 (1st Cir.1988) (observing that \"justice delayed is justice denied\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also emphasized the length of the defendant's absence. For many of the reasons just articulated, the length of the absence can be relevant to determining the extent to which the defendant's conduct disrupted the judicial process. The longer the absence, the more likely it is that the government will have difficulty prosecuting the defendant on his return. In addition by absenting himself, the defendant (if convicted) delays the day on which he will ultimately face punishment. Thus, a long absence would permit a guilty defendant to live for a substantial period in freedom. <i>See United</i> <i>States v. Cherry,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1003</span></span>, 1009-10 (3d Cir.1993) (affirming imposition of upward departure where, <i>inter alia,</i> defendant was absent for 20 years).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, Moreno absented himself for four years, and undoubtedly would have continued that state of affairs had he not been arrested in New York. Conceivably, the length of his absence had an unusually negative impact on the functioning of the judicial process, but there have been no findings to this effect. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(c) (under PROTECT Act district court required to provide written statement of findings justifying the departure). While a 20 year absence would surely be atypical, we are not prepared to say, based on the slender record before us, that the four-year absence here is outside of the heartland. It does not seem obviously unusual that a defendant who absconds shortly after arraignment, with the intention of avoiding trial, might well remain a fugitive for a few years. We are left to speculate whether the duration of Moreno's absence had an unusual impact, (beyond that already accounted for) contributing to the disruption of the judicial process. More than speculation is required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we conclude that one of the component factors, creating a need for multiple trials &#8212; relied on by the district court in its disruption analysis, supports the departure ordered in this case. Two other factors mentioned by the court should not have been relied on, except insofar as they support the multiple trial analysis: that a defendant might miss trial rather than a pre-trial hearing has been adequately considered by the Commission, and the record before us does not sufficiently explain how Moreno's four-year absence takes this case outside of the heartland. As we are unsure what sentence the district court would have imposed had it the benefit of our opinion, we <i>vacate</i> the sentence and <i>remand</i> to allow the court to reimpose sentence, certain that the court will act promptly. <i>See Williams v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112704\"><a href=\"/opinion/112704/williams-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></a></span>, 203, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112704\"><a href=\"/opinion/112704/williams-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
