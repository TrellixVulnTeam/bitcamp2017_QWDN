Ernest C. Torres, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                      Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n                     Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n                and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     John M. Cicilline for appellant.\n     Donald C. Lockhart, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Craig N. Moore, Acting United States Attorney, and Dulce\nDonovan, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                       February 12, 2004\n\f          SELYA,       Circuit   Judge.     In   this    appeal,       defendant-\n\nappellant José Beltran Santos, whose true name is Aramis Estéban\n\nRodríguez, asseverates that the district court erred in calculating\n\nhis guideline sentencing range (GSR) by finding him responsible for\n\nan excessive quantity of drugs and mischaracterizing his role in\n\nthe offenses of conviction.         Discerning no error, we affirm the\n\njudgment below.\n\n          Because this appeal follows a guilty plea, we draw the\n\nfacts   from    the      change-of-plea      colloquy,       the   presentence\n\ninvestigation report (PSI Report), and the transcript of the\n\ndisposition hearing.      See United States v. Tejada-Beltran, 50 F.3d\n\n105, 107 (1st Cir. 1995); United States v. Dietz, 950 F.2d 50, 51\n\n(1st Cir. 1991).\n\n          In the fall of 2001, three malefactors (Moni, Mercedes,\n\nand Guillen) attended a series of meetings that culminated in an\n\nagreement to purchase thirty-five kilograms of cocaine.                         The\n\ntransaction    terms    required   the    purchasers    to   pay   a    total    of\n\n$682,500, with a down payment of $140,000 due at the time of sale\n\nand the balance payable over the next five weeks.              Unbeknownst to\n\nthem, however, this was a sting operation, and the putative sellers\n\nwere, in reality, two undercover FBI agents and a cooperating\n\nindividual (CI).\n\n          At the final pre-sale meeting, the undercover agents\n\nadvised the purchasers that if they planned to use a courier, one\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fof them would have to accompany the courier to a garage in\n\nCranston, Rhode Island (where the cocaine would be delivered),\n\nwhile the others would wait at a different location with the down\n\npayment.   With this arrangement in mind, the three purchasers and\n\nthe appellant traveled to Warwick, Rhode Island, on December 17,\n\n2001, and met with the CI and one of the agents in the parking lot\n\nof a Holiday Inn.    The record reflects that the appellant had been\n\noffered    $2,000   (or,     perhaps,      $2,500    —   the     difference   is\n\ninconsequential     for    present   purposes)      to   act    as   a   courier.\n\nMercedes and Guillen told the agent, in the appellant's presence,\n\nthat they had brought $140,000 in cash as an initial payment for\n\nthe thirty-five kilograms of cocaine.               Mercedes, Moni, and the\n\nmoney remained at the Holiday Inn with the CI while the agent led\n\nGuillen and the appellant to the Cranston garage. During the trip,\n\nGuillen told the appellant that he (Guillen) was being paid between\n\n$10,000 and $15,000 for his participation in the transaction.\n\n           Upon their arrival at the garage, the men were greeted by\n\nmore undercover agents.         On a table inside the garage, fifty\n\nkilograms of cocaine were arrayed in plain view.               One of the agents\n\nasked Guillen and the appellant if they had come to pick up the\n\nthirty-five kilograms of cocaine.            The appellant responded:          \"I\n\nguess.\"    He and Guillen then attempted to open the \"hide\" of the\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fcar in which they had arrived, but they were unable to do so.1\n\nThey proceeded to inspect the cocaine. After acknowledging that it\n\nwas of good quality, they set about preparing it for transport,\n\nsprinkling ground coffee onto each one-kilogram package and then\n\nrewrapping each package in cellophane. Shortly after this activity\n\nbegan — the parties dispute whether the men were in the process of\n\nrepackaging the third or fourth kilogram — the agents arrested\n\nthem.\n\n            On December 19, 2001, a federal grand jury sitting in the\n\nDistrict of Rhode Island returned a two-count indictment that\n\ncharged the appellant and his three confederates with conspiracy to\n\ndistribute in excess of five kilograms of cocaine and attempted\n\npossession of that quantity of cocaine with intent to distribute.\n\nSee   21   U.S.C.   §§    846,   841(a)(1).    The    appellant    initially\n\nmaintained his innocence.        On June 10, 2002, however, he entered a\n\nplea of guilty.          In connection therewith, he executed a plea\n\nagreement, which provided in pertinent part:\n\n            The defendant agrees and understands that the\n            substance involved in this case is powder\n            cocaine.   And that the quantity at issue\n            exceeds five kilograms . . . .\n\nFor its part, the government agreed to recommend that the court\n\nimpose the lowest available sentence consistent with the GSR (as\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      The \"hide\" is apparently         a   secret    compartment   in   which\ncontraband may be stored.\n\n                                     -4-\n\fdetermined by the court) and any applicable statute imposing a\n\nmandatory minimum term of imprisonment.\n\n            On March 28, 2003, the district court convened the\n\ndisposition hearing. The court found the defendant responsible for\n\nthe full thirty-five kilograms of cocaine.            Because the court held\n\nthe appellant responsible for so much cocaine, his base offense\n\nlevel ordinarily would have been 34 — the base offense level for an\n\nindividual who is responsible for fifteen to fifty kilograms of\n\ncocaine.     See USSG §2D1.1(c)(3).             But the court thought the\n\nappellant deserving of a mitigating role adjustment, and, thus, was\n\nrequired    to   cap   his    base    offense    level   at     30.      See   id.\n\n§2D1.1(a)(3).\n\n            From this lowered base offense level, the court granted\n\na three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, see id.\n\n§3E1.1, a two-level \"safety valve\" reduction, see id. §2D1.1(b)(6),\n\nand a two-level mitigating role reduction, see id. §3B1.2(b).2\n\nCoupled with the absence of any previous criminal history, these\n\ndeterminations yielded a GSR of 46-57 months.             See id. ch. 5, pt.\n\nA (sentencing table).        The court thereupon sentenced the appellant\n\nto   an   incarcerative      term    of   forty-six   months.         This   appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n\n\n      2\n      The sentencing guidelines direct that the mitigating role\nadjustment then be made from the capped base offense level. USSG\n§3B1.2, cmt. (n.6). This is a form of \"double counting\" that the\nSentencing Commission has apparently deemed meet.\n\n                                          -5-\n\f           The appellant advances two assignments of error.           First,\n\nhe   asserts    that   the   sentencing     court   erred   in   finding    him\n\nresponsible for a drug quantity in excess of 3.5 kilograms of\n\ncocaine,3 arguing that he could not foresee that the transaction\n\nwould involve so large an amount.         Second, he posits that the court\n\nshould have classified him as a minimal participant rather than a\n\nminor participant.      We discuss these issues sequentially.\n\n           We begin with drug quantity.        A district court's factual\n\nfinding as to the amount of drugs embraced by a conspiracy and\n\nreasonably     foreseeable   by   a   particular    coconspirator    will    be\n\ndisturbed on appeal only if it is clearly erroneous. United States\n\nv. May, 343 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2003); United States v. Garcia, 954\n\nF.2d 12, 16 (1st Cir. 1992).          Considering the concession made in\n\nthe plea agreement and the developments preceding the arrest, the\n\ndistrict court hardly can be said to have erred in holding the\n\nappellant responsible for more than 3.5 kilograms of cocaine.                We\n\nexplain briefly.\n\n           In a drug conspiracy case, \"a key datum in constructing\n\nthe defendant's sentence is the quantity of narcotics attributable\n\n\n\n      3\n      Under the sentencing guidelines, drug quantity bears a direct\ncorrelation to the GSR (and, therefore, to the length of a\ndefendant's sentence). United States v. Conley, 156 F.3d 78, 84\n(1st Cir. 1998).     To achieve a base offense level of 30, a\ndefendant must be responsible for more than 3.5 kilograms of\ncocaine. USSG §2D1.1(c)(5). Because of the \"capping\" effect of\nUSSG §2D1.1(a)(3), see text supra, amounts above that quantity are\nirrelevant in this case.\n\n                                      -6-\n\fto him for sentencing purposes, a datum initially bounded by the\n\nsum of the charged conduct to which the defendant pleads plus his\n\nrelevant uncharged conduct.\"        United States v. Bradley, 917 F.2d\n\n601, 604 (1st Cir. 1990).     Drug quantity is to be derived from all\n\nacts \"that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme\n\nor plan as the offense of conviction.\"          USSG §1B1.3(a)(2).     The\n\nessential inquiry is not what the defendant knew but what acts were\n\nreasonably foreseeable by him.        See United States v. Colón-Solís,\n\n___ F.3d ___, ___ (1st Cir. 2003) [No. 01-1773, slip op. at 5];\n\nGarcia, 954 F.2d at 15.      Thus, each coconspirator is responsible\n\nnot only for the drugs he actually handled but also for the full\n\namount of drugs that he could reasonably have anticipated would be\n\nwithin the ambit of the conspiracy. See USSG §1B1.3(a)(1)(B), cmt.\n\n(n.2); see also United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1197 (1st\n\nCir. 1992).\n\n          The appellant argues that the sentencing court erred in\n\nits drug-quantity determination because he agreed to act as a\n\ncourier without any inkling of how much cocaine his principals were\n\nbuying.   This argument lacks force.\n\n           In   terms   of   the    legal   landscape,   the   appellant's\n\nchallenge must take root in inhospitable soil.           Four points come\n\nreadily to mind.    First, a sentencing court need only support a\n\ndrug-quantity determination by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\nSepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1198.        Second, such a determination need not\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fbe   exact,    but,   rather,    may    be    approximate,          as   long   as    the\n\napproximation represents a reasoned estimate.                       United States v.\n\nRodriguez,     162    F.3d   135,    149     (1st    Cir.     1998).         Third,   the\n\nsentencing court's drug-quantity determination can be set aside\n\nonly if it is clearly erroneous.             United States v. Sklar, 920 F.2d\n\n107, 110-11 (1st Cir. 1990).           Fourth, if there are two plausible\n\nviews of the record, the sentencing court's choice between them\n\ncannot be clearly erroneous.           United States v. Cruz, 120 F.3d 1, 4\n\n(1st Cir. 1997) (en banc).\n\n              Silhouetted against this landscape, the record provides\n\nadequate support for a finding that the appellant reasonably could\n\nhave foreseen that the amount of cocaine involved in the deal would\n\nexceed 3.5 kilograms.         After all, the appellant had pleaded guilty\n\nto conspiring and attempting to possess in excess of five kilograms\n\nof cocaine, and the sentencing court — which expressly found that\n\nthere was a sound factual basis for the plea — was entitled to\n\naccept that      concession     at   face     value     and    to   draw     reasonable\n\ninferences from it.          See, e.g., United States v. Marrero-Rivera,\n\n124 F.3d 342, 353-54 (1st Cir. 1997).                Moreover, the fact that the\n\nappellant was going to be paid a minimum of $2,000 for his\n\nrelatively brief involvement in picking up and transporting the\n\ncontraband     plainly   indicated         that     this   was   not     a   penny-ante\n\n\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\ftransaction.4     Then, too, the appellant was present during a\n\ndiscussion outside the Holiday Inn at which Mercedes and Guillen\n\nmentioned both the quantity to be purchased (thirty-five kilograms)\n\nand the size of the down payment ($140,000), and he saw an enormous\n\namount of cocaine displayed on a table when he first entered the\n\ngarage.   We     previously   have   warned   that    \"[a]   defendant   who\n\nconspires to transport for distribution a large quantity of drugs,\n\nbut happens not to know the precise amount, pretty much takes his\n\nchances that the amount actually involved will be quite large.\"\n\nUnited States v. De La Cruz, 996 F.2d 1307, 1314 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\nThat comment is apposite here.\n\n          The    appellant    argues   that   there    is    countervailing\n\nevidence, for example, that he was not present during any of the\n\npre-sale negotiations and that, when asked if he had come to pick\n\nup thirty-five kilograms, he responded with an enigmatic \"I guess.\"\n\nBut the facts to which he clings do not lead inescapably — or even\n\nlogically — to the conclusion that he foresaw a cache of less than\n\n3.5 kilograms.    The most that can be said for his position is that\n\nthere are two plausible views of the record, and the sentencing\n\ncourt therefore was free to adopt the one that it thought correct.\n\nSee Cruz, 120 F.3d at 4.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      To reinforce this point, the appellant learned, while en\nroute to the Cranston garage, that Guillen was to receive between\n$10,000 and $15,000 for his participation.\n\n                                     -9-\n\f            This brings us to the appellant's argument that he should\n\nhave been classified as a minimal participant in the offenses of\n\nconviction (and, thus, should have received a four-level reduction\n\nunder USSG §3B1.2(a)). The lower court rejected this argument, and\n\nso do we.\n\n            Because     the    sentencing       court's   determination      of   a\n\ndefendant's role in the offense is necessarily fact-specific,\n\nappellate    review    of     such   a   determination     must   be     conducted\n\ndeferentially.      See United States v. Ortiz-Santiago, 211 F.3d 146,\n\n148-49 (1st Cir. 2000); Cruz, 120 F.3d at 3.                  The standard of\n\nreview is for clear error.           Dietz, 950 F.2d at 52.       So long as the\n\ndistrict court's decision is based on reasonable inferences drawn\n\nfrom adequately supported facts, we cannot find it to be clearly\n\nerroneous. United States v. Rosado-Sierra, 938 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir.\n\n1991).     It follows logically that in the absence of a mistake of\n\nlaw — and we descry none here — \"battles over a defendant's status\n\n. . . will almost always be won or lost in the district court.\"\n\nUnited States v. Graciani, 61 F.3d 70, 75 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n            The sentencing guidelines afford two possible adjustments\n\nfor a defendant whose part in the offense of conviction dilutes his\n\nculpability:    a two-level adjustment for minor participation and a\n\nsomewhat     more     generous       four-level    adjustment      for     minimal\n\nparticipation.      See USSG §3B1.2.       The difference between a minimal\n\nand a minor participant is a difference of degree, not kind.\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\fUnited States v. Sanchez, ___ F.3d ___, ___ n.2 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n[No. 02-2504, slip op. at 7 n.2].\n\n           To qualify as a minor participant, a defendant must prove\n\nthat he is both less culpable than his cohorts in the particular\n\ncriminal endeavor and less culpable than the majority of those\n\nwithin the universe of persons participating in similar crimes.\n\nId. at ___ [slip op. at 7]; United States v. Teeter, 257 F.3d 14,\n\n30-31 (1st Cir. 2001).     To qualify as a minimal participant, a\n\ndefendant must prove that he is among the least culpable of those\n\ninvolved in the criminal activity. In our view, this entails proof\n\nthat he is substantially less culpable than his cohorts in the\n\nactual offense and that he is substantially less culpable than the\n\nvast majority of those taking part in similar crimes.                See USSG\n\n§3B1.2, cmt. (nn.3(A), 4, 5); see also United States v. Kerr, 13\n\nF.3d 203, 206 (7th Cir. 1993) (refusing reduction for minimal\n\nparticipation   where   defendant      did   not   prove      that   she   was\n\nsubstantially less culpable than the average participant in similar\n\ncrimes); De La Cruz, 996 F.2d at 1314 (giving as examples of a\n\nminimal participant \"someone who played no other role in a very\n\nlarge   smuggling   operation   than   to    offload   part    of    a   single\n\nmarijuana shipment\" or someone who \"was recruited as a courier for\n\na single smuggling operation involving a small amount of drugs\")\n\n(quoting USSG §3B1.2 cmt. (n.2)).        In short, a defendant must be a\n\n\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fplainly peripheral player to justify his classification as a\n\nminimal participant.\n\n             This standard is hard to meet and, accordingly, it will\n\nbe the rare case in which a defendant will warrant designation as\n\na minimal participant.         See USSG §3B1.2, cmt. (n.4).        That is\n\nespecially    so   since   a   defendant   who   seeks   a   downward   role\n\nadjustment bears the burden of proof on that issue.          United States\n\nv. Ocasio, 914 F.2d 330, 332-33 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n          With this framework in mind we return to the instant\n\ncase.   At the disposition hearing, the appellant argued that his\n\nrole was minimal because he was to act only as a courier and lacked\n\nan understanding of the scope of the criminal enterprise. He makes\n\nessentially the same argument on appeal, insisting that such things\n\nas his somewhat equivocal answer when asked if he was at the garage\n\nto pick up the thirty-five kilograms of cocaine, his absence during\n\nthe pre-sale negotiations, his method of compensation (he was to be\n\npaid a flat fee, not a share of the anticipated profits), and his\n\ninability to open the vehicle's \"hide\" indicate how far removed he\n\nwas from the protagonists.\n\n             To be sure, all of these things count in the appellant's\n\nfavor — but they tell only a part of the story.          For one thing, the\n\nappellant's argument overlooks that the quantity of drugs involved\n\nin this transaction was very large — and the appellant should have\n\nknown as much.     That fact militates against a finding that his role\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fwas minimal.     See, e.g., United States v. Rodriguez Cortes, 949\n\nF.2d 532, 547 (1st Cir. 1991) (holding that \"twenty-six kilos of\n\ncocaine is clearly not the small amount of drugs contemplated in\n\nthe guidelines\" for minimal participation). For another thing, the\n\nrecord contains evidence that the appellant did more than merely\n\nserve as a courier:          for example, he inspected the cocaine for\n\nquality and assisted in repackaging it for transportation.\n\n           The sockdolager is that even those who serve purely and\n\nsimply as drug couriers are not automatically guaranteed mitigating\n\nrole reductions.

Discerning no error, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because this appeal follows a guilty plea, we draw the facts from the change-of-plea colloquy, the presentence investigation report (PSI Report), and the transcript of the disposition hearing. <i>See United States v. Tejada-Beltran,</i> 50 F.3d 105, 107 (1st Cir.1995); <i>United States v. Dietz,</i> 950 F.2d 50, 51 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the fall of 2001, three malefactors (Moni, Mercedes, and Guillen) attended a series of meetings that culminated in an agreement to purchase thirty-five kilograms of cocaine. The transaction terms required the purchasers to pay a total of $682,500, with a down payment of $140,000 due at the time of sale and the balance payable over the next five weeks. Unbeknownst to them, however, this was a sting operation, and the putative sellers were, in reality, two undercover FBI agents and a cooperating individual (CI).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the final pre-sale meeting, the undercover agents advised the purchasers that if they planned to use a courier, one of them would have to accompany the courier to a garage in Cranston, Rhode Island (where the cocaine would be delivered), while the others would wait at a different location with the down payment. With this arrangement in mind, the three purchasers and the appellant traveled to Warwick, Rhode Island, on December 17, 2001, and met with the CI and one of the agents in the parking lot of a Holiday Inn. The record reflects that the appellant had been offered $2,000 (or, perhaps, $2,500 &#8212; the difference is inconsequential for present purposes) to act as a courier. Mercedes and Guillen told the agent, in the appellant's presence, that they had brought $140,000 in cash as an initial payment for the thirty-five kilograms of cocaine. Mercedes, Moni, and the money remained at the Holiday Inn with the CI while the agent led Guillen and the appellant to the Cranston garage. During the trip, Guillen told the appellant that he (Guillen) was being paid between $10,000 and $15,000 for his participation in the transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon their arrival at the garage, the men were greeted by more undercover agents. On a table inside the garage, fifty kilograms of cocaine were arrayed in plain view. One of the agents asked Guillen and the appellant if they had come to pick up the thirty-five kilograms of cocaine. The appellant responded: \"I guess.\" He and Guillen then attempted to open the \"hide\" of the car in which they had arrived, but they were unable to do so.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> They proceeded to inspect the cocaine. After acknowledging that it was of good quality, they set about preparing it for transport, sprinkling ground coffee onto each one-kilogram package and then rewrapping each package in cellophane. Shortly after this activity began &#8212; the parties dispute whether the men were in the process of repackaging the third or fourth kilogram &#8212; the agents arrested them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 19, 2001, a federal grand jury sitting in the District of Rhode Island returned a two-count indictment that charged the appellant and his three confederates with conspiracy to distribute in excess of five kilograms of cocaine and attempted possession of that quantity of cocaine with intent to distribute. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 846, 841(a)(1). The appellant initially maintained his innocence. On June 10, 2002, however, he entered a plea of guilty. In connection therewith, he executed a plea agreement, which provided in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant agrees and understands that the substance involved in this case is powder cocaine. And that the quantity at issue exceeds five kilograms....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For its part, the government agreed to recommend that the court impose the lowest available sentence consistent with the GSR (as determined by the court) and any applicable statute imposing a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 28, 2003, the district court convened the disposition hearing. The court found the defendant responsible for the full thirty-five kilograms of cocaine. Because the court held the appellant responsible for so much cocaine, his base offense level ordinarily would have been 34 &#8212; the base offense level for an individual who is responsible for fifteen to fifty kilograms of cocaine. <i>See</i> USSG &#167; 2D1.1(c)(3). But the court thought the appellant deserving of a mitigating role adjustment, and, thus, was required to cap his base offense level at 30. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 2D1.1(a)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From this lowered base offense level, the court granted a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 3E1.1, a two-level \"safety valve\" reduction, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 2D1.1(b)(6), and a two-level mitigating role reduction, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 3B1.2(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Coupled with the absence of any previous criminal history, these determinations yielded a GSR of 46-57 months. <i>See id.</i> ch. 5, pt. A (sentencing table). The court thereupon sentenced the appellant to an incarcerative term of forty-six months. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant advances two assignments of error. First, he asserts that the sentencing court erred in finding him responsible for a drug quantity in excess of 3.5 kilograms of cocaine,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> arguing that he could not foresee that the transaction would involve so large an amount. Second, he posits that the court should have classified him as a minimal participant rather than a minor participant. We discuss these issues sequentially.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with drug quantity. A district court's factual finding as to the amount of drugs embraced by a conspiracy and reasonably foreseeable by a particular coconspirator will be disturbed on appeal only if it is clearly erroneous. <i>United States v. May,</i> 343 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.2003); <i>United States v. Garcia,</i> 954 F.2d 12, 16 (1st Cir.1992). Considering the concession made in the plea agreement and the developments preceding the arrest, the district court hardly can be said to have erred in holding the appellant responsible for more than 3.5 kilograms of cocaine. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a drug conspiracy case, \"a key datum in constructing the defendant's sentence is the quantity of narcotics attributable to him for sentencing purposes, a datum initially bounded by the sum of the charged conduct to which the defendant pleads plus his relevant uncharged conduct.\" <i>United States v. Bradley,</i> 917 F.2d 601, 604 (1st Cir.1990). Drug quantity is to be derived from all acts \"that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\" USSG &#167; 1B1.3(a)(2). The essential inquiry is not what the defendant knew but what acts were reasonably foreseeable by him. <i>See United States v. Col&#243;n-Sol&#237;s,</i> 354 F.3d 101, 103 (1st Cir.2003); <i>Garcia,</i> 954 F.2d at 15. Thus, each coconspirator is responsible not only for the drugs he actually handled but also for the full amount of drugs that he could reasonably have anticipated would be within the ambit of the conspiracy. <i>See</i> USSG &#167; 1B1.3(a)(1)(B), cmt. (n.2); <i>see also United States v. Sepulveda,</i> 15 F.3d 1161, 1197 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant argues that the sentencing court erred in its drug-quantity determination because he agreed to act as a courier without any inkling of how much cocaine his principals were buying. This argument lacks force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In terms of the legal landscape, the appellant's challenge must take root in inhospitable soil. Four points come readily to mind. First, a sentencing court need only support a drug-quantity determination by a preponderance of the evidence. <i>Sepulveda,</i> 15 F.3d at 1198. Second, such a determination need not be exact, but, rather, may be approximate, as long as the approximation represents a reasoned estimate. <i>United States v. Rodriguez,</i> 162 F.3d 135, 149 (1st Cir.1998). Third, the sentencing court's drug-quantity determination can be set aside only if it is clearly erroneous. <i>United States v. Sklar,</i> 920 F.2d 107, 110-11 (1st Cir.1990). Fourth, if there are two plausible views of the record, the sentencing court's choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous. <i>United States v. Cruz,</i> 120 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1997) (en banc).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Silhouetted against this landscape, the record provides adequate support for a finding that the appellant reasonably could have foreseen that the amount of cocaine involved in the deal would exceed 3.5 kilograms. After all, the appellant had pleaded guilty to conspiring and attempting to possess in excess of five kilograms of cocaine, and the sentencing court &#8212; which expressly found that there was a sound factual basis for the plea &#8212; was entitled to accept that concession at face value and to draw reasonable inferences from it. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Marrero-Rivera,</i> 124 F.3d 342, 353-54 (1st Cir.1997). Moreover, the fact that the appellant was going to be paid a minimum of $2,000 for his relatively brief involvement in picking up and transporting the contraband plainly indicated that this was not a penny-ante transaction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Then, too, the appellant was present during a discussion outside the Holiday Inn at which Mercedes and Guillen mentioned both the quantity to be purchased (thirty-five kilograms) and the size of the down payment ($140,000), and he saw an enormous amount of cocaine displayed on a table when he first entered the garage. We previously have warned that \"[a] defendant who conspires to transport for distribution a large quantity of drugs, but happens not to know the precise amount, pretty much takes his chances that the amount actually involved will be quite large.\" <i>United States v. De La Cruz,</i> 996 F.2d 1307, 1314 (1st Cir.1993). That comment is apposite here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant argues that there is countervailing evidence, for example, that he was not present during any of the pre-sale negotiations and that, when asked if he had come to pick up thirty-five kilograms, he responded with an enigmatic \"I guess.\" But the facts to which he clings do not lead inescapably &#8212; or even logically &#8212; to the conclusion that he foresaw a cache of less than 3.5 kilograms. The most that can be said for his position is that there are two plausible views of the record, and the sentencing court therefore was free to adopt the one that it thought correct. <i>See Cruz,</i> 120 F.3d at 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the appellant's argument that he should have been classified as a minimal participant in the offenses of conviction (and, thus, should have received a four-level reduction under USSG &#167; 3B1.2(a)). The lower court rejected this argument, and so do we.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the sentencing court's determination of a defendant's role in the offense is necessarily fact-specific, appellate review of such a determination must be conducted deferentially. <i>See United States v. Ortiz-Santiago,</i> 211 F.3d 146, 148-49 (1st Cir.2000); <i>Cruz,</i> 120 F.3d at 3. The standard of review is for clear error. <i>Dietz,</i> 950 F.2d at 52. So long as the district court's decision is based on reasonable inferences drawn from adequately supported facts, we cannot find it to be clearly erroneous. <i>United States v. Rosado-Sierra,</i> 938 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1991). It follows logically that in the absence of a mistake of law &#8212; and we descry none here &#8212; \"battles over a defendant's status... will almost always be won or lost in the district court.\" <i>United States v. Graciani,</i> 61 F.3d 70, 75 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentencing guidelines afford two possible adjustments for a defendant whose part in the offense of conviction dilutes his culpability: a two-level adjustment for minor participation and a somewhat more generous four-level adjustment for minimal participation. <i>See</i> USSG &#167; 3B1.2. The difference between a minimal and a minor participant is a difference of degree, not kind. <i>United States v. Sanchez,</i> 354 F.3d 70, 74 n. 2 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To qualify as a minor participant, a defendant must prove that he is both less culpable than his cohorts in the particular criminal endeavor and less culpable than the majority of those within the universe of persons participating in similar crimes. <i>Id.</i> at 74; <i>United States v. Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d 14, 30-31 (1st Cir.2001). To qualify as a minimal participant, a defendant must prove that he is among the least culpable of those involved in the criminal activity. In our view, this entails proof that he is substantially less culpable than his cohorts in the actual offense and that he is substantially less culpable than the vast majority of those taking part in similar crimes. <i>See</i> USSG &#167; 3B1.2, cmt. (nn.3(A), 4, 5); <i>see also United States v. Kerr,</i> 13 F.3d 203, 206 (7th Cir.1993) (refusing reduction for minimal participation where defendant did not prove that she was substantially less culpable than the average participant in similar crimes); <i>De La Cruz,</i> 996 F.2d at 1314 (giving as examples of a minimal participant \"someone who played no other role in a very large smuggling operation than to offload part of a single marijuana shipment\" or someone who \"was recruited as a courier for a single smuggling operation involving a small amount of drugs\") (quoting USSG &#167; 3B1.2 cmt. (n.2)). In short, a defendant must be a plainly peripheral player to justify his classification as a minimal participant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This standard is hard to meet and, accordingly, it will be the rare case in which a defendant will warrant designation as a minimal participant. <i>See</i> USSG &#167; 3B1.2, cmt. (n.4). That is especially so since a defendant who seeks a downward role adjustment bears the burden of proof on that issue. <i>United States v. Ocasio,</i> 914 F.2d 330, 332-33 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With this framework in mind we return to the instant case. At the disposition hearing, the appellant argued that his role was minimal because he was to act only as a courier and lacked an understanding of the scope of the criminal enterprise. He makes essentially the same argument on appeal, insisting that such things as his somewhat equivocal answer when asked if he was at the garage to pick up the thirty-five kilograms of cocaine, his absence during the pre-sale negotiations, his method of compensation (he was to be paid a flat fee, not a share of the anticipated profits), and his inability to open the vehicle's \"hide\" indicate how far removed he was from the protagonists.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, all of these things count in the appellant's favor &#8212; but they tell only a part of the story. For one thing, the appellant's argument overlooks that the quantity of drugs involved in this transaction was very large &#8212; and the appellant should have known as much. That fact militates against a finding that his role was minimal. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Rodriguez Cortes,</i> 949 F.2d 532, 547 (1st Cir. 1991) (holding that \"twenty-six kilos of cocaine is clearly not the small amount of drugs contemplated in the guidelines\" for minimal participation). For another thing, the record contains evidence that the appellant did more than merely serve as a courier: for example, he inspected the cocaine for quality and assisted in repackaging it for transportation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sockdolager is that even those who serve purely and simply as drug couriers are not automatically guaranteed mitigating role reductions. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Lopez-Gil,</i> 965 F.2d 1124, 1131 (1st Cir.1992) (upholding the denial of a two-level \"minor participant\" credit to a drug courier); <i>United States v. Paz Uribe,</i> 891 F.2d 396, 399 (1st Cir.1989) (same). If drug couriers cannot lay claim as of right to minor participant status, the assertion that every drug courier is entitled to a four-level reduction for minimal participation is obviously untenable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the sentencing court carefully appraised the appellant's involvement and acknowledged that he was the least culpable of the four coconspirators. The court determined, however, that he properly should be classified as a minor, not a minimal, participant. Under the circumstances, the court's recension of the evidence seems entirely plausible. Thus, we cannot say that its conclusion was clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.

The transaction terms required the purchasers to pay a total of $682,500, with a down payment of $140,000 due at the time of sale and the balance payable over the next five weeks. Unbeknownst to them, however, this was a sting operation, and the putative sellers were, in reality, two undercover FBI agents and a cooperating individual (CI).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the final pre-sale meeting, the undercover agents advised the purchasers that if they planned to use a courier, one of them would have to accompany the courier to a garage in Cranston, Rhode Island (where the cocaine would be delivered), while the others would wait at a different location with the down payment. With this arrangement in mind, the three purchasers and the appellant traveled to Warwick, Rhode Island, on December 17, 2001, and met with the CI and one of the agents in the parking lot of a Holiday Inn. The record reflects that the appellant had been offered $2,000 (or, perhaps, $2,500 &#8212; the difference is inconsequential for present purposes) to act as a courier. Mercedes and Guillen told the agent, in the appellant's presence, that they had brought $140,000 in cash as an initial payment for the thirty-five kilograms of cocaine. Mercedes, Moni, and the money remained at the Holiday Inn with the CI while the agent led Guillen and the appellant to the Cranston garage. During the trip, Guillen told the appellant that he (Guillen) was being paid between $10,000 and $15,000 for his participation in the transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon their arrival at the garage, the men were greeted by more undercover agents. On a table inside the garage, fifty kilograms of cocaine were arrayed in plain view. One of the agents asked Guillen and the appellant if they had come to pick up the thirty-five kilograms of cocaine. The appellant responded: \"I guess.\" He and Guillen then attempted to open the \"hide\" of the car in which they had arrived, but they were unable to do so.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> They proceeded to inspect the cocaine. After acknowledging that it was of good quality, they set about preparing it for transport, sprinkling ground coffee onto each one-kilogram package and then rewrapping each package in cellophane. Shortly after this activity began &#8212; the parties dispute whether the men were in the process of repackaging the third or fourth kilogram &#8212; the agents arrested them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 19, 2001, a federal grand jury sitting in the District of Rhode Island returned a two-count indictment that charged the appellant and his three confederates with conspiracy to distribute in excess of five kilograms of cocaine and attempted possession of that quantity of cocaine with intent to distribute. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 846, 841(a)(1). The appellant initially maintained his innocence. On June 10, 2002, however, he entered a plea of guilty. In connection therewith, he executed a plea agreement, which provided in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant agrees and understands that the substance involved in this case is powder cocaine.

The court found the defendant responsible for the full thirty-five kilograms of cocaine. Because the court held the appellant responsible for so much cocaine, his base offense level ordinarily would have been 34 &#8212; the base offense level for an individual who is responsible for fifteen to fifty kilograms of cocaine. <i>See</i> USSG &#167; 2D1.1(c)(3). But the court thought the appellant deserving of a mitigating role adjustment, and, thus, was required to cap his base offense level at 30. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 2D1.1(a)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From this lowered base offense level, the court granted a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 3E1.1, a two-level \"safety valve\" reduction, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 2D1.1(b)(6), and a two-level mitigating role reduction, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 3B1.2(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Coupled with the absence of any previous criminal history, these determinations yielded a GSR of 46-57 months. <i>See id.</i> ch. 5, pt. A (sentencing table). The court thereupon sentenced the appellant to an incarcerative term of forty-six months. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant advances two assignments of error. First, he asserts that the sentencing court erred in finding him responsible for a drug quantity in excess of 3.5 kilograms of cocaine,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> arguing that he could not foresee that the transaction would involve so large an amount. Second, he posits that the court should have classified him as a minimal participant rather than a minor participant. We discuss these issues sequentially.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with drug quantity. A district court's factual finding as to the amount of drugs embraced by a conspiracy and reasonably foreseeable by a particular coconspirator will be disturbed on appeal only if it is clearly erroneous. <i>United States v. May,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200626\"><a href=\"/opinion/200626/united-states-v-may/\"><span class=\"volume\">343</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir.2003); <i>United States v.

Considering the concession made in the plea agreement and the developments preceding the arrest, the district court hardly can be said to have erred in holding the appellant responsible for more than 3.5 kilograms of cocaine. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a drug conspiracy case, \"a key datum in constructing the defendant's sentence is the quantity of narcotics attributable to him for sentencing purposes, a datum initially bounded by the sum of the charged conduct to which the defendant pleads plus his relevant uncharged conduct.\" <i>United States v. Bradley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"550637\"><a href=\"/opinion/550637/united-states-v-robert-e-bradley/\"><span class=\"volume\">917</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">601</span></a></span>, 604 (1st Cir.1990). Drug quantity is to be derived from all acts \"that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\" USSG &#167; 1B1.3(a)(2). The essential inquiry is not what the defendant knew but what acts were reasonably foreseeable by him. <i>See United States v. Col&#243;n-Sol&#237;s,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200804\"><a href=\"/opinion/200804/united-states-v-colon-solis/\"><span class=\"volume\">354</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">101</span></a></span>, 103 (1st Cir.2003); <i>Garcia,</i> 954 F.2d at 15. Thus, each coconspirator is responsible not only for the drugs he actually handled but also for the full amount of drugs that he could reasonably have anticipated would be within the ambit of the conspiracy. <i>See</i> USSG &#167; 1B1.3(a)(1)(B), cmt. (n.2); <i>see also United States v. Sepulveda,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"662432\"><a href=\"/opinion/662432/united-states-v-david-sepulveda-united-states-of-america-v-edgar/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1161</span></a></span>, 1197 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant argues that the sentencing court erred in its drug-quantity determination because he agreed to act as a courier without any inkling of how much cocaine his principals were buying. This argument lacks force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In terms of the legal landscape, the appellant's challenge must take root in inhospitable soil. Four points come readily to mind. First, a sentencing court need only support a drug-quantity determination by a preponderance of the evidence. <i>Sepulveda,</i> 15 F.3d at 1198. Second, such a determination need not be exact, but, rather, may be approximate, as long as the approximation represents a reasoned estimate. <i>United States v. Rodriguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198229\"><a href=\"/opinion/198229/united-states-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">135</span></a></span>, 149 (1st Cir.1998). Third, the sentencing court's drug-quantity determination can be set aside only if it is clearly erroneous. <i>United States v. Sklar,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552336\"><a href=\"/opinion/552336/united-states-v-david-sklar-united-states-of-america-v-david-sklar/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></a></span>, 110-11 (1st Cir.1990). Fourth, if there are two plausible views of the record, the sentencing court's choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous. <i>United States v. Cruz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744197\"><a href=\"/opinion/744197/united-states-v-ceferino-cruz/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir.1997) (en banc).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Silhouetted against this landscape, the record provides adequate support for a finding that the appellant reasonably could have foreseen that the amount of cocaine involved in the deal would exceed 3.5 kilograms. After all, the appellant had pleaded guilty to conspiring and attempting to possess in excess of five kilograms of cocaine, and the sentencing court &#8212; which expressly found that there was a sound factual basis for the plea &#8212; was entitled to accept that concession at face value and to draw reasonable inferences from it. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Marrero-Rivera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197543\"><a href=\"/opinion/197543/united-states-v-marrero-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">342</span></a></span>, 353-54 (1st Cir.1997). Moreover, the fact that the appellant was going to be paid a minimum of $2,000 for his relatively brief involvement in picking up and transporting the contraband plainly indicated that this was not a penny-ante transaction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Then, too, the appellant was present during a discussion outside the Holiday Inn at which Mercedes and Guillen mentioned both the quantity to be purchased (thirty-five kilograms) and the size of the down payment ($140,000), and he saw an enormous amount of cocaine displayed on a table when he first entered the garage. We previously have warned that \"[a] defendant who conspires to transport for distribution a large quantity of drugs, but happens not to know the precise amount, pretty much takes his chances that the amount actually involved will be quite large.\" <i>United States v. De La Cruz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610551\"><a href=\"/opinion/610551/united-states-v-efrain-de-la-cruz-united-states-v-luis-torres/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1307</span></a></span>, 1314 (1st Cir.1993). That comment is apposite here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant argues that there is countervailing evidence, for example, that he was not present during any of the pre-sale negotiations and that, when asked if he had come to pick up thirty-five kilograms, he responded with an enigmatic \"I guess.\" But the facts to which he clings do not lead inescapably &#8212; or even logically &#8212; to the conclusion that he foresaw a cache of less than 3.5 kilograms. The most that can be said for his position is that there are two plausible views of the record, and the sentencing court therefore was free to adopt the one that it thought correct. <i>See Cruz,</i> 120 F.3d at 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the appellant's argument that he should have been classified as a minimal participant in the offenses of conviction (and, thus, should have received a four-level reduction under USSG &#167; 3B1.2(a)). The lower court rejected this argument, and so do we.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the sentencing court's determination of a defendant's role in the offense is necessarily fact-specific, appellate review of such a determination must be conducted deferentially. <i>See United States v.

The standard of review is for clear error. <i>Dietz,</i> 950 F.2d at 52.

To qualify as a minimal participant, a defendant must prove that he is among the least culpable of those involved in the criminal activity. In our view, this entails proof that he is substantially less culpable than his cohorts in the actual offense and that he is substantially less culpable than the vast majority of those taking part in similar crimes. <i>See</i> USSG &#167; 3B1.2, cmt.

(n.2)). In short, a defendant must be a plainly peripheral player to justify his classification as a minimal participant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This standard is hard to meet and, accordingly, it will be the rare case in which a defendant will warrant designation as a minimal participant. <i>See</i> USSG &#167; 3B1.2, cmt.

At the disposition hearing, the appellant argued that his role was minimal because he was to act only as a courier and lacked an understanding of the scope of the criminal enterprise. He makes essentially the same argument on appeal, insisting that such things as his somewhat equivocal answer when asked if he was at the garage to pick up the thirty-five kilograms of cocaine, his absence during the pre-sale negotiations, his method of compensation (he was to be paid a flat fee, not a share of the anticipated profits), and his inability to open the vehicle's \"hide\" indicate how far removed he was from the protagonists.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, all of these things count in the appellant's favor &#8212; but they tell only a part of the story. For one thing, the appellant's argument overlooks that the quantity of drugs involved in this transaction was very large &#8212; and the appellant should have known as much. That fact militates against a finding that his role was minimal. <i>See, e.g., United States v.
