Oumar Toure is a native and\n\ncitizen of Mauritania. He entered the United States from Canada in\n\nMay 2002 and in November of that year filed an application for\n\nasylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention\n\nAgainst Torture. In January 2003 the government instituted removal\n\nproceedings against Toure on a charge of being present in this\n\ncountry without having been properly admitted.                The Immigration\n\nJudge (IJ) who heard Toure's case found that he had not proven\n\neligibility for any relief and ordered him removed to Mauritania.\n\nThe Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed the IJ's order in\n\na written opinion, and Toure brought a timely petition for review\n\nby this court.       After a careful review of the record, we affirm.\n\n                                       I.\n\n     We relate Toure's account of the events culminating in his\n\narrival   in   the    United    States.1    As   a   child,   Toure   lived   in\n\nMauritania with his parents, who owned two farms.                 Toure is a\n\nmember of the minority Soninke ethnic group and describes his group\n\nas \"black Africans.\"           In 1989, when he was ten years old, the\n\nfamily, along with thousands of other ethnic minority Mauritanians,\n\nfell victim to forced emigration at the hands of the ruling Beydane\n\nethnic group.    Armed members of the government militia, who were\n\nBeydane, came to Toure's family's land and threatened them with\n\n\n\n     1\n      With one main exception, discussed below, the IJ found Toure\nto be a credible witness.\n\n                                      -2-\n\fviolence if they did not leave.    The Beydane told the family that\n\n\"all blacks had to get out\" and forced them onto a boat, which took\n\nthem across the river into Senegal.\n\n     After spending six years at a refugee camp in Senegal, Toure's\n\nfamily returned to Mauritania in 1995 along with thousands of other\n\nrepatriating refugees and reclaimed the family farms.        In the\n\nsummer of 1996, the Beydane returned to the family's land.     This\n\ntime, the Beydane told the family to leave because they could not\n\nproduce adequate proof of ownership.    However, the family remained\n\non their farm for the next two years; the militia returned several\n\ntimes but never became violent. In 1998, Toure's family once again\n\nemigrated to Senegal, eventually moving in with a friend in the\n\ncity of Dakar.   Toure and his family were not subjected to threats\n\nor harm in Senegal but did have difficulty finding work there.\n\nToure testified that he would have stayed in Senegal had he been\n\nable to earn better wages.\n\n     Toure and his family had been in Dakar for three years when\n\nthe son of the person with whom they were staying returned home\n\nfrom Canada, where he had been attending school. The son suggested\n\nthat Toure leave Senegal and lent him documents to use to travel to\n\nCanada.   Arrangements were then made to smuggle Toure over the\n\nU.S.–Canadian border in a boat, and he arrived in the United States\n\nnear Buffalo, New York, in May 2002.      He applied for asylum in\n\nNovember of the same year, claiming that he had been subjected to\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\frace-based persecution in Mauritania and that he feared future\n\npersecution should he be forced to return there.\n\n     At his hearing before the IJ, Toure testified that when the\n\nBeydane first came to his family's land in 1989 members of his\n\nfamily were beaten with the butt of a rifle.          The IJ, noting that\n\nToure had not made clear whether he himself was beaten or just his\n\nparents, found that Toure had not credibly established that he\n\nhimself had been beaten.     She concluded that he had not made the\n\nrequisite showing of past persecution based on the events of that\n\nday in 1989.    In addition, Toure had initially testified that his\n\nfamily was beaten during the second confrontation with the Beydane,\n\nin 1996, but then corrected his testimony to say that they were not\n\nbeaten   at   that   time.   The   IJ   accordingly   concluded   that   no\n\npersecution occurred then either.         Finding Toure ineligible for\n\nasylum or other relief, she ordered him removed to Mauritania, his\n\ncountry of nationality.\n\n     The BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ's decision.         In addition,\n\nthe BIA stated that, even if Toure's family did suffer past\n\npersecution at the hands of the Beydane in 1989 when they were\n\nfirst forced to leave Mauritania, the fact that thousands of\n\nrefugees, including Toure's family, returned to Mauritania in the\n\nmid-1990s manifested a change in country conditions sufficient to\n\nrebut any presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution.\n\nNoting that Toure had not proven persecution upon his family's\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\freturn to Mauritania in 1995, the BIA affirmed the order of\n\nremoval.   Toure now petitions for review.\n\n                                    II.\n\n     We uphold the BIA's decisions on asylum claims unless the\n\nevidence   presented   by     the   petitioner    compels      a   reasonable\n\nfactfinder to conclude he is entitled to relief.              Nai Qing Xu v.\n\nGonzales, 424 F.3d 45, 47-48 (1st Cir. 2005).             A petitioner hoping\n\nto be granted asylum, like Toure, bears the burden of proving he\n\nqualifies as a \"refugee.\"      Id. at 48.   A showing of refugee status\n\ncan be made either \"(1) by demonstrating a well-founded fear of\n\npersecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership\n\nin a particular social group, or political opinion, or (2) by\n\nproving past persecution on account of one of the aforementioned\n\ngrounds,   which   entitles    an   applicant    to   a    presumption   of   a\n\nwell-founded fear of persecution.\"        Diab v. Ashcroft, 397 F.3d 35,\n\n39 (1st Cir. 2005) (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A)).             Even if a\n\npetitioner has proven past persecution, the presumption that he has\n\na corresponding well-founded fear of future persecution should he\n\nreturn to his native country can be rebutted by the government.\n\nThe government bears the burden of rebutting the presumption by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence.       Manzoor v. U.S. Dep't of Justice,\n\n254 F.3d 342, 347 (1st Cir. 2001).          Evidence of changed country\n\nconditions can suffice to rebut the presumption, as long as the\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fevidence negates the petitioner's own particular fear.                        Palma-\n\nMazariegos v. Gonzales, 428 F.3d 30, 35 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n     The    IJ    concluded      that   Toure       had   not   demonstrated   past\n\npersecution in Mauritania.            The BIA agreed and added that even if\n\nthe treatment suffered by Toure's family in 1989 is considered\n\npersecution, country conditions had changed enough that Toure had\n\nno well-grounded fear of future persecution in Mauritania.                    In his\n\npetition to this court, Toure makes three arguments: (1) that the\n\nIJ had no basis for her determination that Toure's testimony about\n\nthe beatings was not credible; (2) that the BIA was wrong to hold\n\nthat conditions in Mauritania have changed enough to render Toure's\n\nfear of future persecution there unwarranted; and (3) that the\n\nevidence demonstrates that Toure did, in fact, along with his\n\nfamily, suffer persecution because of his race at the hands of the\n\nMauritanian government in 1989.                 We find that, even assuming the\n\n1989 forced emigration constituted past persecution, the resulting\n\npresumption       that   Toure    has       a    well-founded    fear    of   future\n\npersecution is negated by the events that unfolded in the following\n\nyears.     Accordingly, we affirm the BIA's decision.                    (We do not\n\naddress the question whether the documented return to Mauritania of\n\nthousands    of    refugees      in   the       mid-1990s,   generally    speaking,\n\nconstitutes a change in country conditions sufficient to rebut a\n\nwell-founded fear of future race-based persecution stemming from\n\nearlier events.)\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\f      Determining whether a petitioner has demonstrated persecution\n\ncalls for a case-by-case analysis.             Manzoor, 254 F.3d at 346.\n\nPersecution \"is not restricted to threats to life or freedom, [but]\n\nit requires more than mere harassment or annoyance.\" Id. (internal\n\nquotations and citations omitted).        We assume for present purposes\n\nthat Toure and his family were subject to persecution based on race\n\nwhen the Beydane ousted them from their land and forced them and\n\nother Soninkes to leave the country.2          Subsequent events, however,\n\nmust be taken into consideration. In 1995, Toure's family returned\n\nto Mauritania.       They reclaimed their two farms and resided there\n\npeacefully for the next year and a half.         When the Beydane returned\n\na   second   time,    their   dispute   with    Toure's   family   concerned\n\ndocumentation of title, not race or ethnicity. Although the second\n\nconfrontation might have been racially or ethnically motivated, the\n\nBIA did not find that it was, and the evidence presented by Toure\n\ndoes not mandate such a finding.        Toure himself testified that the\n\nsecond dispute was about whether his family could prove ownership\n\nof their land and that the family chose to emigrate to Senegal, in\n\ncontrast to the first eviction, when they were forcibly sent abroad\n\nby armed militia.\n\n\n      2\n      The IJ found all of Toure's testimony credible except for his\ndescription of how the Beydane beat members of his family. Toure\nchallenges this credibility determination, but we find it\nimmaterial to the outcome of the case. Whether or not any physical\nviolence occurred on that day in 1989, Toure's family was ousted\nfrom their home and forced to leave the country under threat of\nviolence.\n\n                                    -7-\n\f     When all the evidence is viewed together, it is apparent that\n\nsubsequent events in Mauritania and in the lives of Toure and his\n\nfamily \"negate[d]\" the \"particular fear\" Toure may have had after\n\nthe 1989 ouster.   Palma-Mazariegos, 428 F.3d at 35; cf. Carcamo-\n\nRecinos v. Ashcroft, 389 F.3d 253, 258 (1st Cir. 2004) (upholding\n\nIJ's finding that petitioner lacked well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution where petitioner willingly returned to his home country\n\nand remained there \"for more than two years after the alleged\n\npersecution peaked\"). In short, after a careful examination of the\n\nrecord, we cannot say that the evidence compels the conclusion that\n\nToure successfully demonstrated his eligibility for asylum by\n\nshowing a well-founded fear of future persecution in Mauritania.\n\nWe therefore do not disturb the judgment of the BIA denying Toure\n\nrelief.3\n\n                               III.\n\n     For the reasons stated above, we affirm the decision of the\n\nBoard of Immigration Appeals and deny Toure's petition for judicial\n\nreview.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      If a petitioner has not established eligibility for asylum,\nhe has also not established eligibility for withholding of removal,\nwhich erects a higher hurdle for a petitioner than does an asylum\nclaim. See Jin Dong Zeng v. Gonzales, 436 F.3d 26, __ n.3 (1st\nCir. 2006). As to Toure's petition for relief under the Convention\nAgainst Torture, he does not here challenge the IJ's determination\nthat he was not entitled to such relief.\n\n                               -8-\n\f",

Palma-\n\nMazariegos v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201897\"><a href=\"/opinion/201897/palma-mazariegos-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 35 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n     The    IJ    concluded      that   Toure       had   not   demonstrated   past\n\npersecution in Mauritania.            The BIA agreed and added that even if\n\nthe treatment suffered by Toure's family in 1989 is considered\n\npersecution, country conditions had changed enough that Toure had\n\nno well-grounded fear of future persecution in Mauritania.                    In his\n\npetition to this court, Toure makes three arguments: (1) that the\n\nIJ had no basis for her determination that Toure's testimony about\n\nthe beatings was not credible; (2) that the BIA was wrong to hold\n\nthat conditions in Mauritania have changed enough to render Toure's\n\nfear of future persecution there unwarranted; and (3) that the\n\nevidence demonstrates that Toure did, in fact, along with his\n\nfamily, suffer persecution because of his race at the hands of the\n\nMauritanian government in 1989.                 We find that, even assuming the\n\n1989 forced emigration constituted past persecution, the resulting\n\npresumption       that   Toure    has       a    well-founded    fear    of   future\n\npersecution is negated by the events that unfolded in the following\n\nyears.     Accordingly, we affirm the BIA's decision.                    (We do not\n\naddress the question whether the documented return to Mauritania of\n\nthousands    of    refugees      in   the       mid-1990s,   generally    speaking,\n\nconstitutes a change in country conditions sufficient to rebut a\n\nwell-founded fear of future race-based persecution stemming from\n\nearlier events.)\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\f      Determining whether a petitioner has demonstrated persecution\n\ncalls for a case-by-case analysis.             Manzoor, 254 F.3d at 346.\n\nPersecution \"is not restricted to threats to life or freedom, [but]\n\nit requires more than mere harassment or annoyance.\" Id. (internal\n\nquotations and citations omitted).        We assume for present purposes\n\nthat Toure and his family were subject to persecution based on race\n\nwhen the Beydane ousted them from their land and forced them and\n\nother Soninkes to leave the country.2          Subsequent events, however,\n\nmust be taken into consideration. In 1995, Toure's family returned\n\nto Mauritania.       They reclaimed their two farms and resided there\n\npeacefully for the next year and a half.         When the Beydane returned\n\na   second   time,    their   dispute   with    Toure's   family   concerned\n\ndocumentation of title, not race or ethnicity. Although the second\n\nconfrontation might have been racially or ethnically motivated, the\n\nBIA did not find that it was, and the evidence presented by Toure\n\ndoes not mandate such a finding.        Toure himself testified that the\n\nsecond dispute was about whether his family could prove ownership\n\nof their land and that the family chose to emigrate to Senegal, in\n\ncontrast to the first eviction, when they were forcibly sent abroad\n\nby armed militia.\n\n\n      2\n      The IJ found all of Toure's testimony credible except for his\ndescription of how the Beydane beat members of his family. Toure\nchallenges this credibility determination, but we find it\nimmaterial to the outcome of the case. Whether or not any physical\nviolence occurred on that day in 1989, Toure's family was ousted\nfrom their home and forced to leave the country under threat of\nviolence.\n\n                                    -7-\n\f     When all the evidence is viewed together, it is apparent that\n\nsubsequent events in Mauritania and in the lives of Toure and his\n\nfamily \"negate[d]\" the \"particular fear\" Toure may have had after\n\nthe 1989 ouster.

Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201347\"><a href=\"/opinion/201347/carcamo-recinos-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">253</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 258 (1st Cir. 2004) (upholding\n\nIJ's finding that petitioner lacked well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution where petitioner willingly returned to his home country\n\nand remained there \"for more than two years after the alleged\n\npersecution peaked\"). In short, after a careful examination of the\n\nrecord, we cannot say that the evidence compels the conclusion that\n\nToure successfully demonstrated his eligibility for asylum by\n\nshowing a well-founded fear of future persecution in Mauritania.\n\nWe therefore do not disturb the judgment of the BIA denying Toure\n\nrelief.3\n\n                               III.\n\n     For the reasons stated above, we affirm the decision of the\n\nBoard of Immigration Appeals and deny Toure's petition for judicial\n\nreview.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      If a petitioner has not established eligibility for asylum,\nhe has also not established eligibility for withholding of removal,\nwhich erects a higher hurdle for a petitioner than does an asylum\nclaim.
