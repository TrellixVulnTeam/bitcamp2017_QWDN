Carmen Consuelo Cerezo, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                      Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n              Selya and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Rafael F. Castro Lang, by appointment of the court, for\nappellant.\n     Rosa Emilia Rodríguez-Vélez, United States Attorney, Nelson\nPérez-Sosa and Julia M. Meconiates, Assistant United States\nAttorneys, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                              May 15, 2008\n\f               Per Curiam.   Florian1 Otero pleaded guilty to one count\n\nof aiding and abetting the distribution of five or more kilograms\n\nof cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and one count of\n\ncarrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug-trafficking\n\noffense in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1).                   On February 22,\n\n2007, the district court sentenced Otero to a term of eighty-four\n\nmonths' imprisonment for the drug-trafficking offense and sixty\n\nmonths'    imprisonment      for    the     firearm   offense,    to    be   served\n\nconsecutively.       Otero appeals, arguing that his conviction must be\n\nreversed because the magistrate judge who took his guilty plea\n\nfailed to inform him of the elements of the drug-trafficking\n\noffense.\n\n               The   following     facts    are    drawn    primarily   from    the\n\nuncontested      portions    of    the    Presentence      Investigation     Report.\n\nBefore his arrest, Otero served as a municipal police officer in\n\nVega Baja, Puerto Rico.             During the summer of 2005, the Drug\n\nEnforcement Administration and the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\nconducted a joint investigation of corrupt police officers involved\n\nin illegal drug trafficking in northern Puerto Rico.                The agencies\n\nset   up   a    sting   operation    in    which   undercover     agents     offered\n\nofficers money in exchange for assistance transporting the drugs.\n\n\n\n      1\n      It is not entirely clear from the record whether the\ndefendant's name is correctly spelled \"Floiran\" or \"Florian.\" We\nopt for \"Florian,\" the version which appellant has utilized on\nappeal.\n\n                                           -2-\n\fIn exchange for $3,000.00, Otero escorted a load of what he\n\nbelieved to be illegal drugs from Vega Alta to Mantí, Puerto Rico.\n\nOtero claims that, after rejecting four previous solicitations to\n\nprovide escort services, he accepted the fifth such invitation\n\nbecause he needed money to finance an on-going custody dispute\n\nconcerning his three minor children.\n\n           Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure\n\nrequires a court to conduct a plea colloquy to ensure that a\n\ndefendant has been fully informed of his rights and ascertain\n\nwhether his plea is knowing and voluntary. United States v. Smith,\n\n511   F.3d 77, 85 (1st Cir. 2007).   The court must, inter alia, make\n\ncertain that the defendant understands \"the nature of each charge\n\nto which [he] is pleading.\"   Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(b)(1)(G).    While\n\na lower court may not discharge its obligations simply by obtaining\n\n\"a defendant's acknowledgment of signed agreements or other written\n\ndocuments,\"   Smith, 511 F.3d at 85 (citation omitted), we do not\n\nrequire that the court mechanically recite any fixed incantation.\n\nUnited States v. Cotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\nRather, viewing the record as a whole, we examine the totality of\n\nthe circumstances surrounding the plea to determine whether the\n\nobjectives of the procedural safeguards imposed by Rule 11 have\n\nbeen satisfied.   See United States v. Negron-Narvaez, 403 F.3d 33,\n\n39 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n\n\n\n                                -3-\n\f           Because Otero did not object during or at the conclusion\n\nof his plea hearing, we review the magistrate judge's purported\n\nfailure to follow the procedures prescribed by Rule 11 only for\n\nplain error.2   See United States v. Vonn, 535 U.S. 55, 59 (2002);\n\nSmith, 511 F.3d at 85.    To establish plain error, a defendant must\n\nshow the existence of (1) an error; (2) that is plain; (3) that\n\naffected his substantial rights; and (4) seriously affects the\n\nfairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\n\nUnited States v. Roy, 506 F.3d 28, 30 (1st Cir. 2007) (citing\n\nUnited States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732 (1993)).            In the Rule 11\n\ncontext,   satisfying   the   third    prong   of   this    test   requires   a\n\ndefendant to demonstrate a reasonable probability that, but for the\n\nalleged error, he would not have pleaded guilty.            United States v.\n\nCaraballo-Rodriguez, 480 F.3d 62, 76 (1st Cir. 2007).              Obviously,\n\nwe need not credit a defendant's self-serving representations to\n\nthis effect.    See United States v. Matos-Quinones, 456 F.3d 14, 23\n\n(1st Cir. 2006).\n\n           Otero   asserts    that    the   undercover     agent's3   repeated\n\ninvitations for him to participate in the drug-trafficking scheme\n\nconstitute entrapment, negating intent.             Thus, Otero postulates\n\n\n     2\n      We decline to address the parties' conflict regarding the\napplication of the waiver of appeal signed by Otero because doing\nso is unnecessary to our conclusion.\n     3\n      Otero suggests that he was solicited by a government\ninformant rather than an agent. Under these circumstances, any\nfactual discrepancy is inconsequential.\n\n                                      -4-\n\fthat, if the magistrate judge had informed him of the intent\n\nelement of the charged offense, he would not have pleaded guilty.\n\nWhile it would have been preferable had the magistrate judge\n\nexplicitly described the elements of the charged offenses, we\n\ndetect no plain error requiring us to vacate Otero's conviction.\n\n           First, the record substantiates that Otero was almost\n\ncertainly made aware of the requirement that the Government prove\n\nintent.   The indictment explicitly alleged the intent element of\n\nthe drug-trafficking offense. At the change of plea hearing, Otero\n\nacknowledged that he received a copy of the indictment, reviewed\n\nit, and discussed it with counsel.           Likewise, the plea agreement\n\nalso indicated the requirement of intent in relation to the drug-\n\ntrafficking    crime.     At   the   change     of    plea   hearing,   Otero\n\nacknowledged that he had signed the plea agreement, discussed it\n\nwith his attorney, and understood it to represent his agreement\n\nwith the Government.     Defense counsel informed the court that he\n\nhad translated the plea agreement into Spanish for his client.\n\nMoreover, we cannot help but observe that \"drug trafficking [is\n\nnot] an obscure crime to a policeman.\"          United States v. Padilla-\n\nGallarza, 351 F.3d 594, 598 (1st Cir. 2003).           In sum, we simply do\n\nnot   credit   Otero's   assertion    that    he     was   unaware   that   the\n\nGovernment must prove intent to obtain a conviction under 21 U.S.C.\n\n§ 841(a)(1).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f           Second, although the record has not been fully developed,\n\nOtero's evidence of entrapment appears to be minimal.                     \"Entrapment\n\nis an affirmative defense.\"         United States v. Shinderman, 515 F.3d\n\n5, 14 (1st Cir. 2008).            To make out a prima facie claim of\n\nentrapment sufficient to warrant a jury instruction, a defendant\n\nmust show both improper inducement by the government and a lack of\n\npredisposition to commit the offense on his part.                   Id.       \"Improper\n\ninducement consists of more than providing an opportunity to commit\n\na crime . . . .\"        United States v. Turner, 501 F.3d 59, 70 (1st\n\nCir. 2007).     \"The something 'more' generally consists of excessive\n\npressure   by    the    government      agent    on   the    defendant          or   the\n\nexploitation of a defendant's noncriminal motive . . . .\"                            Id.\n\n           Here, Otero has not satisfied either prong.                        The fact\n\nthat the agent may have asked Otero to participate in the scheme on\n\nmultiple   occasions      does    not   necessarily      equate          to    improper\n\ninducement.     See United States v. Pratt, 913 F.2d 982, 989 (1st\n\nCir. 1990) (rejecting defendant's contention that he was entitled\n\nto jury instruction regarding entrapment given evidence of multiple\n\nphone   calls    from     the    government     agent,      even        coupled      with\n\ndefendant's failure to return phone calls and appear at scheduled\n\nmeetings); accord United States v. Acosta, 67 F.3d 334, 338 (1st\n\nCir. 1995) (refusing to hold inducement improper as a matter of law\n\nwhere   informant       made    repeated      solicitations        to     defendant).\n\nGenerally, we have emphasized the method in which the inducement\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fwas attempted, rather than the sheer number of solicitations that\n\noccurred, in determining whether inducement in a particular case\n\nwas improper.       See United States v. Gendron, 18 F.3d 955, 961-62\n\n(1st Cir. 1994) (listing cases finding improper inducement); see\n\nalso United States v. Teleguz, 492 F.3d 80, 84 (1st Cir. 2007)\n\n(explaining       that    improper     inducement       cannot    be    shown   by\n\ndemonstrating enthusiasm and persistence of informant).                      Here,\n\nOtero has furnished no description of the circumstances surrounding\n\nthe   alleged      solicitations       that     would    indicate      any   undue\n\ncoerciveness.       The bare assertion that he declined four previous\n\ninvitations to commit the offense, standing alone, is not enough.\n\n            Additionally, Otero's purported prior refusals are not\n\nconclusive as to his supposed lack of predisposition to commit the\n\ncrime.     Rather, Otero's own statements suggest the probability\n\nthat, while he may not have been predisposed to commit the offense\n\ninitially, his need for money to fund a bitter custody battle with\n\nhis ex-wife made him receptive to the crime.                Significantly, Otero\n\ndoes not allege that the Government was ever aware of his financial\n\ndifficulties.          United States v. Pena, 201 F.3d 429, 1999 WL\n\n1319183,    at    *7    (1st   Cir.   Nov.    16,   1999)    (unpublished    table\n\nopinion).        Because there is no suggestion that the Government\n\nintentionally exploited, much less precipitated, Otero's economic\n\nstraits, he cannot transform his motive for committing the crime\n\ninto an affirmative defense. See id. (rejecting entrapment defense\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fwhere defendant testified that he needed money to provide his\n\nchildren with school books); United States v. Panet-Collazo, 960\n\nF.2d 256, 259 (1st Cir. 1992) (explaining that \"[e]ntrapment does\n\nnot blossom whenever a person succumbs to . . . the lure of easy\n\nmoney\" to ensure family's financial security (citation omitted)\n\n(first alteration in original)).         Undoubtedly, many defendants\n\ndecide to break the law only after suffering pecuniary hardship,\n\nbut that does not ordinarily absolve them of culpability.\n\n           Had this case gone to trial, it is possible, though\n\nunlikely, that Otero would have adduced sufficient evidence to\n\nwarrant a jury instruction on entrapment.          See Acosta, 67 F.3d at\n\n338. Otero has failed, however, to demonstrate that the undercover\n\nagent's solicitations to him constitute entrapment as a matter of\n\nlaw.   He has fallen well short of demonstrating a reasonable\n\nprobability   that   he   would   have   pleaded    not   guilty   had   the\n\nmagistrate judge explained the intent element of the offense.\n\n           Accordingly, we reject Otero's plain error challenge\n\nbased on his Rule 11 proceeding.     The record reflects that he was,\n\nin fact, aware of the intent element of the drug-trafficking\n\noffense.   Additionally, he has not presented adequate evidence of\n\nentrapment to overcome the high hurdle imposed by the plain error\n\nstandard. For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Otero's convictions\n\nand sentences.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\f",

Thus, Otero postulates\n\n\n     2\n      We decline to address the parties' conflict regarding the\napplication of the waiver of appeal signed by Otero because doing\nso is unnecessary to our conclusion.\n     3\n      Otero suggests that he was solicited by a government\ninformant rather than an agent. Under these circumstances, any\nfactual discrepancy is inconsequential.\n\n                                      -4-\n\fthat, if the magistrate judge had informed him of the intent\n\nelement of the charged offense, he would not have pleaded guilty.\n\nWhile it would have been preferable had the magistrate judge\n\nexplicitly described the elements of the charged offenses, we\n\ndetect no plain error requiring us to vacate Otero's conviction.\n\n           First, the record substantiates that Otero was almost\n\ncertainly made aware of the requirement that the Government prove\n\nintent.   The indictment explicitly alleged the intent element of\n\nthe drug-trafficking offense. At the change of plea hearing, Otero\n\nacknowledged that he received a copy of the indictment, reviewed\n\nit, and discussed it with counsel.           Likewise, the plea agreement\n\nalso indicated the requirement of intent in relation to the drug-\n\ntrafficking    crime.     At   the   change     of    plea   hearing,   Otero\n\nacknowledged that he had signed the plea agreement, discussed it\n\nwith his attorney, and understood it to represent his agreement\n\nwith the Government.     Defense counsel informed the court that he\n\nhad translated the plea agreement into Spanish for his client.\n\nMoreover, we cannot help but observe that \"drug trafficking [is\n\nnot] an obscure crime to a policeman.\"          United States v.

In sum, we simply do\n\nnot   credit   Otero's   assertion    that    he     was   unaware   that   the\n\nGovernment must prove intent to obtain a conviction under 21 U.S.C.\n\n§ 841(a)(1).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f           Second, although the record has not been fully developed,\n\nOtero's evidence of entrapment appears to be minimal.                     \"Entrapment\n\nis an affirmative defense.\"         United States v.

To make out a prima facie claim of\n\nentrapment sufficient to warrant a jury instruction, a defendant\n\nmust show both improper inducement by the government and a lack of\n\npredisposition to commit the offense on his part.

The fact\n\nthat the agent may have asked Otero to participate in the scheme on\n\nmultiple   occasions      does    not   necessarily      equate          to    improper\n\ninducement.

Here,\n\nOtero has furnished no description of the circumstances surrounding\n\nthe   alleged      solicitations       that     would    indicate      any   undue\n\ncoerciveness.       The bare assertion that he declined four previous\n\ninvitations to commit the offense, standing alone, is not enough.\n\n            Additionally, Otero's purported prior refusals are not\n\nconclusive as to his supposed lack of predisposition to commit the\n\ncrime.     Rather, Otero's own statements suggest the probability\n\nthat, while he may not have been predisposed to commit the offense\n\ninitially, his need for money to fund a bitter custody battle with\n\nhis ex-wife made him receptive to the crime.                Significantly, Otero\n\ndoes not allege that the Government was ever aware of his financial\n\ndifficulties.          United States v.

Nov.    16,   1999)    (unpublished    table\n\nopinion).        Because there is no suggestion that the Government\n\nintentionally exploited, much less precipitated, Otero's economic\n\nstraits, he cannot transform his motive for committing the crime\n\ninto an affirmative defense.

Undoubtedly, many defendants\n\ndecide to break the law only after suffering pecuniary hardship,\n\nbut that does not ordinarily absolve them of culpability.\n\n           Had this case gone to trial, it is possible, though\n\nunlikely, that Otero would have adduced sufficient evidence to\n\nwarrant a jury instruction on entrapment.          See Acosta, 67 F.3d at\n\n338. Otero has failed, however, to demonstrate that the undercover\n\nagent's solicitations to him constitute entrapment as a matter of\n\nlaw.   He has fallen well short of demonstrating a reasonable\n\nprobability   that   he   would   have   pleaded    not   guilty   had   the\n\nmagistrate judge explained the intent element of the offense.\n\n           Accordingly, we reject Otero's plain error challenge\n\nbased on his Rule 11 proceeding.     The record reflects that he was,\n\nin fact, aware of the intent element of the drug-trafficking\n\noffense.   Additionally, he has not presented adequate evidence of\n\nentrapment to overcome the high hurdle imposed by the plain error\n\nstandard. For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Otero's convictions\n\nand sentences.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\f</pre>",
