Plaintiffs-appellees         ATC\n\nRealty, LLC and SBA Towers, Inc. filed suit in district court\n\nseeking an order directing the Town of Kingston, New Hampshire to\n\ngrant them all the permits necessary to construct a wireless\n\ntelecommunications tower in the town.            The district court granted\n\nsummary judgment in plaintiffs' favor on the ground that there was\n\ninsufficient evidence to support the Town of Kingston's decision to\n\ndeny plaintiffs' application to construct a tower.                   Defendant-\n\nappellant Town of Kingston (\"Town\" or \"Kingston\") appeals the\n\ndistrict court's grant of summary judgment, arguing that the Town's\nrejection     of   the   plaintiffs'      application       is   supported      by\n\nsubstantial    evidence.      Because     we     conclude    that    there     was\nsubstantial evidence to support the Town's decision in the record,\nwe reverse entry of summary judgment for plaintiffs and direct that\n\nsummary judgment be entered for the Town.\n\n                            FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n            Wireless service companies provide consumers with mobile\ntelephone service.       To activate the technology upon which their\nservice   relies,   these   companies     must    construct      a   network   of\ntelecommunication towers that transmits low-power, high-frequency\n\nradio signals. Incapable of building this network alone, they rely\n\non plaintiffs SBA Towers and ATC Realty (collectively, \"SBA/ATC\")\n\nto develop such telecommunication towers for them.               Plaintiffs, in\n\nturn, lease antenna facilities on these towers to the wireless\n\nservice companies.\n\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f            In 1999, several wireless service providers noticed a\n\nsignificant coverage gap along Route 125 in the northern region of\n\nKingston, New Hampshire.            This gap left customers in the area\nwithout wireless telecommunications service and disconnected the\n\ntelephone calls of mobile phone users passing through the gap.\n\nSeeking to rectify this problem, SBA/ATC applied to the Kingston\nPlanning Board (\"Planning Board\" or \"Board\") for permission to\n\nconstruct     \"an     unlighted    180      foot     free    standing      multi-user\n\ntelecommunication tower\" on Marshall Road in Kingston.1 Two months\nafter the plaintiffs submitted their application, however, American\n\nTower, a direct competitor, applied for a permit to construct a\n\nsimilar tower on Depot Road in Kingston.\n\n            After holding several public hearings, conducting on-site\ninspections of the proposed tower locations, and consulting a\n\ntelecommunications expert, the Planning Board voted on October 17,\n\n2000, to approve the construction of only one of the two proposed\ntowers.     In      the   same   meeting,      the   Board    voted   to    deny   the\n\nplaintiffs'      application      for   a   construction       permit   and,    in   a\n\nsubsequent vote, to grant American Tower's application.                      Finally,\n\nthe Board voted again to deny plaintiffs' application.\n\n            Shortly thereafter, the Planning Board issued a written\n\ndecision formally adopting the results of the votes taken at the\n\n\n1\n  Like many municipalities, Kingston has enacted an ordinance that\nregulates the siting of wireless telecommunication towers.     See\nKingston, N.H., Zoning & Building Codes art. VII, § 7.80 (1997)\n(\"Telecommunications Facility Ordinance\"). Under the ordinance, an\napplicant seeking to build such a facility must obtain a\nconditional use permit from the Kingston Planning Board. See id.\n\n                                         -3-\n\fOctober 17 meeting.    Using the Town's Telecommunications Facility\n\nOrdinance    to   define   its   criteria,   the   Board   rejected   the\n\nplaintiffs' application on four grounds:\n            1)    Based upon the purposes section of the\n            Kingston zoning ordinance letters C and E it\n            is the responsibility of the Kingston Planning\n            board to provide for minimal impact siting and\n            to   require  cooperation   and   coordination\n            between telecommunications service providers\n            in order to reduce cumulative negative impacts\n            upon Kingston.\n\n            2)     The location of [SBA/ATC's] proposed\n            location is in close proximity to residential\n            abutters.   While there are commercial users\n            backing into the property, the majority of the\n            abutting and nearby properties are residential\n            and of a rural nature.     The siting of this\n            tower does not meet the intent of the\n            ordinance to reduce adverse impacts on\n            neighborhood aesthetics.\n\n            3) The design of the [SBA/ATC] tower does not\n            prevent nor reduce the visual intrusive\\ness\n            [sic] along the NH Route 125 corridor.\n            Minimizing the adverse visual impact is\n            required by the Town’s ordinances.\n\n            4)    The     Planning    Board     hired    a\n            telecommunication consultant to assist in\n            determining the technical viability of the\n            SBA/ATC site.      This consultant provided\n            evidence that two proposed sites offered the\n            same ability to cover existing service gaps.\n            As a result, the SBA/ATC site failed to meet\n            the standard of section D) of the Town’s\n            ordinance which indicates that all other\n            reasonable opportunities have been exhausted.\n            In addition Section VII,. 3., paragraph h and\n            j require the Planning Board to consider other\n            factors in making decisions that include\n            availability of existing towers and other\n            structures and the availability of alternative\n            siting locations. The Planning board has done\n            this with respect to this denial.\n\n            After their application was rejected in writing, SBA/ATC\n\nfiled this suit in the United States District Court for the\n\n                                   -4-\n\fDistrict of New Hampshire, claiming that the Board's decision was\n\nnot supported by substantial evidence as required by statute.    See\n\n47 U.S.C. § 332(c)(7)(B)(iii).   The district court granted summary\njudgment in plaintiffs' favor, and the Town filed this timely\n\nappeal.\n\n                         STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n            We review de novo the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment.   See Straughn v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 250 F.3d 23, 33\n\n(1st Cir. 2001).\n\n            Summary judgment is appropriate when \"the pleadings,\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\n\ntogether with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine\nissue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled\nto judgment as a matter of    law.\"    Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).   \"[T]o\n\ndefeat a properly supported motion for summary judgment, the\nnonmoving party must establish a trial-worthy issue by presenting\nenough competent evidence to enable a finding favorable to the\n\nnonmoving party.\"    LeBlanc v. Great Am. Ins. Co., 6 F.3d 836, 842\n\n(1st Cir. 1993) (internal quotation marks omitted).    In exercising\nour review, we construe the record evidence \"in the light most\n\nfavorable to, and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of,\nthe nonmoving party.\"     Feliciano de la Cruz v. El Conquistador\n\nResort & Country Club, 218 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f                                 DISCUSSION\n\n                                     I.\n\n            The Telecommunications Act (\"TCA\") works like a scale\n\nthat, inter alia, attempts to balance two objects of competing\nweight: on one arm sits the need to accelerate the deployment of\n\ntelecommunications technology, while on the other arm rests the\n\ndesire to preserve state and local control over zoning matters. 47\nU.S.C. § 332(c)(7)(A)-(B) (1994 & Supp. II 1996); see generally\n\nSouthwestern Bell Mobile Sys. v. Todd, 244 F.3d 51, 61 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).    Accordingly, though state and local governments have the\npower \"to deny . . . request[s] to place, construct, or modify\npersonal wireless service facilities,\" their decisions must be \"in\nwriting and supported by substantial evidence contained in a\n\nwritten record.\"       47 U.S.C. § 332(c)(7)(B)(iii).             This balance\nstrengthens the decision making authority of local zoning boards,\nwhile    protecting   wireless    service    providers     from    unsupported\n\ndecisions     that    stymie   the    expansion     of     telecommunication\ntechnology.    See generally Brehmer v. Planning Bd. of Wellfleet,\n\n238 F.3d 117, 122 (1st Cir. 2001).\n            Plaintiffs   SBA/ATC     argue   that   they   are    entitled   to\n\nsummary judgment because the Town's rejection of their application\n\nis not supported by substantial evidence.           \"The TCA's substantial\n\nevidence test is a procedural safeguard which is centrally directed\n\nat whether the local zoning authority's decision is consistent with\n\nthe applicable zoning requirements.\"          Omnipoint Communications MB\n\nOperations v. Lincoln, 107 F. Supp. 2d 108, 115 (D. Mass. 2000)\n\n                                     -6-\n\f(citing Amherst v. Omnipoint Communications Enters., Inc., 173 F.3d\n\n9, 16 (1st Cir. 1999)).             Substantial evidence \"does not mean a\n\nlarge or considerable amount of evidence, but rather such evidence\nas   a   reasonable     mind   might   accept      as   adequate   to   support   a\n\nconclusion.\"     Cellular Tel. Co. v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment of Ho-\n\nHo-Kus,    197   F.3d    64,   71    (3d    Cir.    1999)   (internal   citations\nomitted). The Board's decision will thus withstand our scrutiny if\n\nit is \"supported by . . . more than a scintilla of evidence.\"\n\nCellular Tel. Co. v. Oyster Bay, 166 F.3d 490, 494 (2d Cir. 1999);\n\naccord NLRB v. Grand Canyon Mining Co., 116 F.3d 1039, 1044 (4th\n\nCir. 1997) (\"[Substantial evidence] requires more than a scintilla\n\nbut less than a preponderance.\" (internal citations omitted)).\n\n                                           II.\n\n            This case does not involve a claim that the Board has\n\neffectively prohibited the provision of telecommunication services\nneeded to close a service gap.                   See 47 U.S.C. § 332(c)(7)(B)\n\n(i)(II).    Rather, the Board has granted permission to plaintiffs'\n\ncompetitors to build a tower which will close the service gap along\nRoute 125.\n            The only question before us is whether the Board's\n\ndecision to deny the plaintiff's application is supported by\nsubstantial evidence. In determining that question, in the absence\nof any claim of procedural irregularity by the Board, we restrict\n\nour review to the record before the Board.              See Nat'l Tower, LLC v.\n\nPlainville Zoning Bd. of Appeals, No. 01-2472, 2002 U.S. App. LEXIS\n\n14465 at *17-*18 (1st Cir. July 18, 2002); Todd, 244 F.3d at 58\n\n                                           -7-\n\f(quoting Penobscot Air Servs., Ltd. v. Fed. Aviation Admin., 164\n\nF.3d 713, 718 (1st Cir. 1999)).                  We do not review the question de\n\nnovo;   we    must       uphold    the    Board's     decision     unless    it   is   not\nsupported by substantial evidence.\n\n              Before scrutinizing the factors cited by the Board in\n\ndefense of its decision to reject plaintiffs' application, we pause\nto consider what mode of analysis to apply.                   The Town argues that,\n\nin   determining         whether    the    Board's      decision     is    supported    by\n\nsubstantial evidence, we should not compare the relative merits of\n\nthe two applications.             Instead, we should simply focus on whether\n\nthere   is        sufficient      evidence       in   the   record    to    reject     the\n\nplaintiffs' application. Conversely, the plaintiffs claim that the\n\nBoard's votes to deny their application and to grant American\nTower's application should essentially be treated as one decision.\n\nThis approach, then, would require the Board to provide substantial\n\nevidence for its decision to choose American Tower's application\nover the plaintiffs'.\n\n              For the purposes of this appeal, we assume, without\n\ndeciding, that the comparative model proposed by plaintiffs is the\n\nproper analytical framework.                 Even after employing this more\n\nexacting model, however, we find that the plaintiffs have failed to\n\ndemonstrate that the Board's selection of American Tower's bid\n\ninstead      of    the    plaintiffs'       is    not   supported     by    substantial\n\nevidence.\n\n\n\n\n                                            -8-\n\f                                       III.\n\n            In its written decision, the Board offered four reasons\n\nfor    rejecting     the    plaintiffs'       application           to    construct    a\n\ntelecommunication tower.        We address each justification in turn.\n\nA.    Cooperation Among Service Providers\n\n           The     first    reason    set    forth       in   the   Board's    written\n\ndecision for denying plaintiffs' application concerns the Town's\nresponsibility to provide for minimal impact siting and to promote\n\ncooperation between competitors.                  Under the Telecommunications\n\nFacility Ordinance, the Town is required to limit the construction\nof telecommunication towers by encouraging cooperation between\ncompetitors and having as many wireless service providers on a\nsingle tower as possible.          Art. VII, § 7.80(II)(C).              The Board felt\n\nthat the plaintiffs' application did not adequately meet these\nobjectives.\n            In defense of the Board's reliance on this factor, the\n\nTown cites    persuasive      evidence       in    the    record     to    support    the\nconclusion    that   only    one     tower    was    necessary       to    rectify    the\ncoverage gap. For instance, Tony Wells, a radio frequency engineer\nfor American Tower, stated that \"the coverage for either [tower]\n\nproposal would be equivalent.\"                In addition, Ivan Pagacik, an\n\nindependent telecommunications consultant, informed the Board that\n\n\"[t]he proposed American Tower site at 140 feet does fill in th[e]\n\n[coverage] gap.\"2\n\n2\n    Pagacik noted, however, that American Tower's proposal to\nconstruct a 140-foot tower would provide minimal overlap with the\n\n                                        -9-\n\f             Though this evidence may justify the Board's decision to\n\nconstruct    only   one   tower,   however,    it   provides    no     basis   for\n\nchoosing American Tower's application over the plaintiffs'.                    The\ncrucial question, then, is whether the plaintiffs have shown that\n\nthe Board's reliance on this factor to select American Tower's\n\nproposal over the plaintiffs' is not supported by substantial\nevidence.3    Both SBA/ATC and American Tower assured the Planning\n\nBoard that they would allow competing wireless service providers to\n\nuse the antenna facilities on their towers.             The only difference\n\nbetween the proposals is that whereas the plaintiffs' proposed\n\ntower could accommodate six wireless service providers, American\n\nTower could only hold five providers on its tower.              Thus, in terms\n\nof   willingness    to    cooperate    and    ability   to     serve    wireless\n\n\n\ncoverage provided by nearby towers. This decreased overlap would\nlikely affect the ability of mobile telephone users to make a\nsuccessful transition from coverage provided by an antenna on one\ntower to coverage provided by an antenna on another tower.\n\n     This conclusion, however, is largely irrelevant because the\nPlanning Board granted American Tower permission to construct a\ntower 40 feet higher than the height at which Pagacik conducted his\ntests.   As plaintiffs' counsel conceded at oral argument, the\nhigher a tower is, the stronger coverage it provides. Thus, it is\nreasonable to infer, especially at the summary judgment level, that\nthe 40-foot increase in the tower's height went a long way in\nfixing any overlap deficiency. General support for drawing this\ninference can be found in SBA/ATC's own experimental tests, which\nshow that the \"coverage gap could not be filled at 140 [feet],\" but\nit could be filled at 180 feet.\n\n     Moreover, Pagacik allegedly told several Board members,\nwithout ambiguity, that only one tower was necessary since either\nof the proposed towers would suffice to cover the service gap.\n3\n  Because the Board specifically dealt with minimal impact siting\nin its other reasons for rejecting plaintiffs' application, we\nreserve our discussion on that issue until it is more pertinent.\n\n                                      -10-\n\fcompanies,    the    proposals      are    virtually     identical,    with   the\n\nplaintiffs' application being marginally better.4\n\nB.   Impact on Residential Properties and Neighborhood Aesthetics\n\n           The    Board's     second      reason   for   denying    plaintiffs'\n\napplication for a conditional use permit was that their proposed\n\ntower was too close to residential abutters and had an adverse\n\nimpact on neighborhood aesthetics.             Under the Telecommunications\n\nFacility   Ordinance,       the    Town   is   authorized    to    consider   the\n\nproximity of proposed towers to residential development and their\n\nimpact on the surrounding aesthetics.              Art. VII, § 7.80(II)(B).\n           The two proposed sites are largely indistinguishable with\n\nrespect to their proximity to residential areas.              Both sites have\nresidential      abutters    and    commercial      businesses     within   close\nproximity.     They are also essentially equidistant from the areas\n\nzoned for commercial use.          Thus, the proposals are quite similar,\nif not identical, with respect to this factor.\n             In regard to the aesthetic impact of the towers, the\n\nBoard considered comments from residential abutters to the proposed\n\n\n4\n  Plaintiffs also argue that the inferiority of the American Tower\nproposal is evidenced by the fact that American Tower still has not\nbeen able to lease the antenna facilities on its tower to any\nwireless service provider, despite the fact that its application\nwas approved by the Board.\n\n     However, it is too speculative to attribute American Tower's\ninability to contract with any wireless service providers to its\ntower's inferiority. The dearth of clientele may be a product of\nthe fact that wireless service companies are waiting to see the\noutcome of this litigation before committing to one tower or\nwaiting to see if two towers are constructed in the Town, thereby\nmaximizing competition and reducing lease rates. We thus give no\nweight to plaintiffs' speculative argument.\n\n                                       -11-\n\fsites.     See, e.g., Todd, 244 F.3d at 61 (finding substantial\n\nevidence of adverse visual impact where residents specifically\n\ncomplained that the proposed tower was of a different magnitude\nthan anything else in the vicinity and was inconsistent with the\n\nresidential uses around it).              Several residential neighbors to the\n\nplaintiffs'       site    criticized       SBA/ATC's       tower    for    its   adverse\naesthetic impact.          Resident abutters Elisha and Steven Blaisdell\n\nobjected to the proposed tower, arguing that it would destroy the\n\n\"picturesque\" quality of the surrounding area.                      Mariah Champagne\n\nsubmitted a letter characterizing plaintiffs' tower as an \"eyesore\"\n\nthat should be situated in a more rural location.                         She also took\n\nissue with the fact that the tower would be located on property\n\nthat     was    once     listed    by     the     state    as    being     historically\nsignificant.           Tina Staublin echoed concerns over the adverse\n\naesthetic       impact    the     tower    would    have    on     the    neighborhood.\n\nFinally, Andrea and Almus Kenter expressed their displeasure over\nhaving a \"clear view\" of the proposed tower from their home.                        They\n\nalso emphasized the fact that the tower's construction would be\n\ninconsistent with the surrounding bucolic area.\n\n               Thus, nearly forty percent of the residential abutters to\n\nthe plaintiffs' proposed site opposed the application on aesthetic\n\ngrounds.       Conversely, the Board did not receive a single aesthetic\n\nobjection to the American Tower proposal.                   Moreover, at least one\n\nBoard member attended a crane test on American Tower's proposed\n\nsite, which involved elevating a crane to 180 feet to determine the\n\nvisibility of the proposed tower from the surrounding neighborhood.\n\n\n                                           -12-\n\fThe results of the test demonstrated that \"the crane was very\n\ndifficult to see,\" which may explain why no aesthetic objections\n\nwere made to the American Tower proposal.\n            Plaintiffs largely ignore the results of this empirical\n\ntest and concentrate their attack on what they perceive to be the\n\neasier target: the residential abutters' comments.               SBA/ATC argue\nthat local residents cannot defeat a tower proposal merely by\n\ntrumpeting \"negative comments that are applicable to any tower,\n\nregardless of location.\"         Todd, 244 F.3d at 61.           Because they\n\ncharacterize the residential abutters' comments as generalized\n\naesthetic    objections,       plaintiffs    conclude     that     the     Board\n\nincorrectly relied upon this evidence to distinguish between the\n\ntwo proposals.\n            Though several of the abutters' objections to the visual\n\nimpact of the plaintiffs' tower specifically addressed why the\n\nproposed facility was inappropriate for the chosen site, we will\nassume, for the sake of argument, that the abutters' comments were\n\nso general that they could apply to any tower.             Even assuming as\n\nmuch, however, the Board correctly relied on this evidence in light\n\nof   the   facts   of   this   unusual   case.   As     noted,    courts    have\n\nconsistently held that a \"few generalized expressions of concern\n\nwith 'aesthetics' cannot serve as substantial evidence on which [a\n\ntown] could base [a] denial.\"            Oyster Bay, 166 F.3d at 496.\n\nHowever, these rulings have not been made in the context of a town\n\ndeciding between two proposed towers.        Rather, they have been made\n\nin cases in which towns have rejected the only proposed tower\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\fapplication    before     them.     See,      e.g.,   Todd,       244   F.3d    at   52;\n\nPreferred Sites v. Troup County, No. 01-14182, 2002 WL 1473139, at\n\n*2 (11th Cir. July 10, 2002); Telespectrum, Inc. v. Pub. Serv.\n\nComm'n of Ky., 227 F.3d 414, 418 (6th Cir. 2000); Omnipoint Corp.\n\nv. Zoning Hearing Bd. of Pine Grove, 181 F.3d 403, 407 (3d Cir.\n\n1999).   In the latter context, courts fear that local governments\nmay be relying on abutters' general aesthetic objections to mask a\n\nde facto prohibition of wireless service.                 See generally Todd, 244\n\nF.3d at 61.\n\n            In contrast, the instant case, given the mode of analysis\n\nwe have employed, involves the Board's comparison between two\n\ncompeting     proposals      and   its     selection       of     American     Tower's\n\napplication    over    the     plaintiffs'.         The    fact    that   the    Board\nultimately     granted    a     permit     to   the    plaintiffs'        competitor\n\ndemonstrates    that     the   Board     is   not   generally      hostile      to   the\n\nconstruction of telecommunication towers.                 In this context, when a\nplanning board has decided to construct a tower and must decide\n\nwhich of several proposed towers to construct, it is perfectly\n\nreasonable for the Board to consider, and be swayed by, the general\n\naesthetic concerns of residential abutters, especially where, as\n\nhere, the proposed towers are otherwise virtually identical.\n\n            In sum, whereas both applications are identical with\n\nrespect to proximity to residential abutters, there is undisputed\n\nevidence that the plaintiffs' application would have a stronger\n\nadverse aesthetic impact on the surrounding neighborhood.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -14-\n\fC.   Visual Intrusiveness Along Route 125\n\n          The      Board   based    its     third     reason   for    rejecting\n\nplaintiffs'   application     on    the   fact   that   \"the   design   of   the\n\n[SBA/ATC] tower does not reduce visual intrusiveness along the\n\nRoute 125 corridor.\"         Though the record supports the Board's\n\nconclusion, it also indicates that both proposed towers would be\n\nvisible from Route 125.        However, the best evidence of minimal\n\nvisual intrusiveness came after a Board member conducted a visual\n\ninspection    of   the   American   Tower    site    from   Route    125.    She\n\nconcluded that she \"could hardly see [the tower] with the exception\nof one small spot . . . .     She thought that if she were not looking\n\nfor [the tower], it would not be seen.\"5            Plaintiffs have presented\nno evidence to challenge this observation.6\n\n\n\n\n5\n   Presumably, this visual test was conducted when the crane,\nsubstituting for the tower, was in place.\n6\n   Plaintiffs also fault the Board for failing to consider the\nvisual impact that the American Tower proposal would have on\nproperty with historical significance. See Telecommunications\nFacility Ordinance art. VII, § 7.80(B) (stating that the Board may\nconsider the impact that a proposed tower may have on \"historically\nsignificant locations\").    In this regard, several Board members\nobserved that the plaintiffs' proposal would have no visual impact\non the historic district; however, no such finding was made with\nrespect to the American Tower proposal.\n\n     Though no specific finding was made regarding the visual\nimpact that the American Tower proposal would have on the historic\ndistrict of Kingston, the Board conducted several photographic\nsimulations illustrating the view of the proposed tower from\nseveral locations. The Board also conducted an on-site inspection\nand took several aerial photos of the proposed tower. Neither the\nsimulations nor the photographs indicates any visual intrusion on\nthe historic district of Kingston.\n\n                                     -15-\n\fD.    Failure to Exhaust Alternative Opportunities\n\n            The final reason for denying SBA/ATC's application for a\n\nconditional use permit was that plaintiffs had failed to exhaust\n\nall    other      reasonable        opportunities.                  Pursuant       to      the\n\nTelecommunications Facility Ordinance, the Board is directed to\n\n\"[p]ermit the construction of new towers only where all other\n\nreasonable opportunities have been exhausted.\"                        Art. VII, § 7.80\n\n(II)(D).\n\n            The only other reasonable opportunity available here was\n\nthe competing proposal.            However, the plaintiffs submitted their\napplication to the Planning Board two months prior to American\n\nTower's application.        Thus, at the time SBA/ATC applied, American\nTower's    non-existent        application       could        not    have       provided     a\nreasonable     opportunity      that      the    plaintiffs          were       required    to\n\nexhaust.\n            The    Board    also    rejected         the   plaintiffs'          application\nbecause it     found    that    plaintiffs           had   failed     to    consider       the\n\navailability of existing sites.                 More specifically, because the\nBoard granted American Tower's application before its final vote to\nreject the plaintiffs' application, the Board decided not to\n\napprove     the     plaintiffs'        application           because        a    reasonable\nalternative       opportunity      existed      --    that    is,    American       Tower's\nrecently approved site.\n\n             However,      given    the      comparative          framework        we   have\nemployed,    this    factor     does    not     provide       a   basis     for    choosing\n\nAmerican Tower's proposal over the plaintiffs'.                        It assumes that\n\n                                          -16-\n\fAmerican Tower has been selected and faults the plaintiffs for not\n\nexploring that existing option.              Thus, this justification assumes\n\nprecisely what        we   are     trying    to    determine:     whether    there     is\nsubstantial evidence in the record to support the Board's selection\n\nof American Tower's proposal over the plaintiffs'.\n\nE.    The Results\n\n             After reviewing the record, we find that the plaintiffs\n\nhave failed to demonstrate that the Board's selection was not\n\nsupported      by   substantial       evidence.           The   Planning    Board      was\n\npresented with two proposed towers that were virtually identical:\nthe   towers    were   of    the    same     height;      covered    the   same    area;\n\naccommodated almost the same number of wireless providers; could be\nseen, in comparable fashion, from Route 125; had residential\nabutters; and were roughly equidistant from commercial zones.\n\nThere is only one substantive difference between the proposed\ntowers: unlike American Tower's application, plaintiffs' proposal\nengendered     much    opposition      due    to    its    adverse    impact      on   the\n\nsurrounding neighborhood aesthetic.\n             We must reiterate that our review is not focused on\nwhether the Planning Board made the best or the correct decision.\n\nSee   AT&T   Wireless       PCS,    Inc.    v.    Winston-Salem       Zoning   Bd.      of\n\nAdjustment, 172 F.3d 307, 314 (4th Cir. 1999) (\"The reviewing court\ncannot replace the agency's judgment, even if the court could have\n\nreached a justifiably different conclusion between two conflicting\nviews had it reviewed the matter de novo.\").                         Rather, we must\n\nsimply determine whether the plaintiffs have demonstrated that the\n\n                                           -17-\n\fBoard's decision to choose American Tower's application over their\n\napplication is supported by substantial evidence.                 Given the\n\nextreme similarity between the two proposals, and the Board's\njustifiable reliance on abutter comments to distinguish between\n\nthem, we find that more than a scintilla of evidence exists to\n\nsupport the Board's decision and direct the district court to enter\nsummary judgment in favor of the Town.\n\n                                        IV.\n\n               This case comes to us after a decision based on cross\n\nmotions for summary judgment.            Cross motions do not necessarily\nindicate agreement by the parties as to the material facts in the\n\nrecord.    See Boston Five Cents Sav. Bank v. Sec'y of the Dep't of\n\nHous. and Urban Dev., 768 F.2d 5, 11-12 (1st Cir. 1985); Wiley v.\nAm. Greetings Corp., 762 F.2d 139, 140-41 (1st Cir. 1985).               But\n\nhere, as we have stressed, the basis for decision is limited to the\nfactual record that was before the Board.         In this situation, it is\nappropriate for an appellate court to not only reverse a grant of\n\nsummary judgment for one party, but direct its entry to the other\nparty.    See Wightman v. Springfield Terminal Ry. Co., 100 F.3d 228\n\n(1st Cir. 1996) (\"Cross motions simply require us to determine\n\nwhether either of the parties deserves judgment as a matter of law\n\non facts that are not disputed.\" (emphasis added)).          Because there\nis substantial evidence in the undisputed facts before the Board to\n\nsupport its decision, we direct entry of summary judgment for the\nBoard    and    dismissal   of   this   case.   Our   decision   is   further\n\nsupported by the clear aim of the TCA, echoed in our precedents, of\n\n                                        -18-\n\fexpediting resolution of litigation over placement of wireless\n\ntelecommunication facilities.

The district court granted summary judgment in plaintiffs' favor on the ground that there was insufficient evidence to support the Town of Kingston's decision to deny plaintiffs' application to construct a tower. Defendant-appellant Town of Kingston (\"Town\" or \"Kingston\") appeals the district court's grant of summary judgment, arguing that the Town's rejection of the plaintiffs' application is supported by substantial evidence.

To activate the technology upon which their service relies, these companies must construct a network of telecommunication towers that transmits low-power, high-frequency radio signals. Incapable of building this network alone, they rely on plaintiffs SBA Towers and ATC Realty (collectively, \"SBA/ATC\") to develop such telecommunication towers for them. Plaintiffs, in turn, lease antenna facilities on these towers to the wireless service companies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1999, several wireless service providers noticed a significant coverage gap along Route 125 in the northern region of Kingston, New Hampshire. This gap left customers in the area without wireless telecommunications service and disconnected the telephone calls of mobile phone users passing through the gap. Seeking to rectify this problem, SBA/ATC applied to the Kingston Planning Board (\"Planning Board\" or \"Board\") for permission to construct \"an unlighted 180 foot free standing multi-user telecommunication tower\" on Marshall Road in Kingston.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Two months after the plaintiffs submitted their application, however, American Tower, a direct competitor, applied for a permit to construct a similar tower on Depot Road in Kingston.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After holding several public hearings, conducting on-site inspections of the proposed tower locations, and consulting a telecommunications expert, the Planning Board voted on October 17, 2000, to approve the construction of only one of the two proposed towers. In the same meeting, the Board voted to deny the plaintiffs' application for a construction permit and, in a subsequent vote, to grant American Tower's application. Finally, the Board voted again to deny plaintiffs' application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly thereafter, the Planning Board issued a written decision formally adopting the results of the votes taken at the October 17 meeting. Using the Town's Telecommunications Facility Ordinance to define its criteria, the Board rejected the plaintiffs' application on four grounds:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1) Based upon the purposes section of the Kingston zoning ordinance letters C and E it is the responsibility of the Kingston Planning board to provide for minimal impact siting and to require cooperation and coordination between telecommunications service providers in order to reduce cumulative negative impacts upon Kingston.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2) The location of [SBA/ATC's] proposed location is in close proximity to residential abutters. While there are commercial users backing into the property, the majority of the abutting and nearby properties are residential and of a rural nature. The siting of this tower does not meet the intent of the ordinance to reduce adverse impacts on neighborhood aesthetics.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3) The design of the [SBA/ATC] tower does not prevent nor reduce the visual intrusive ness [sic] along the NH Route 125 corridor.

This consultant provided evidence that two proposed sites offered the same ability to cover existing service gaps. As a result, the SBA/ATC site failed to meet the standard of section D) of the Town's ordinance which indicates that all other reasonable opportunities have been exhausted. In addition Section VII.3., paragraph h and j require the Planning Board to consider other factors in making decisions that include availability of existing towers and other structures and the availability of alternative siting locations.

Rather, the Board has granted permission to plaintiffs' competitors to build a tower which will close the service gap along Route 125.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only question before us is whether the Board's decision to deny the plaintiff's application is supported by substantial evidence. In determining that question, in the absence of any claim of procedural irregularity by the Board, we restrict our review to the record before the Board. <i>See Nat'l Tower, LLC v. Plainville Zoning Bd. of Appeals,</i> 297 F.3d 14, 22 (1st Cir.2002); <i>Todd,</i> 244 F.3d at 58 (quoting <i>Penobscot Air Servs., Ltd. v. Fed. Aviation Admin.,</i> 164 F.3d 713, 718 (1st Cir.1999)). We do not review the question de novo; we must uphold the Board's decision unless it is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before scrutinizing the factors cited by the Board in defense of its decision to reject plaintiffs' application, we pause to consider what mode of analysis to apply. The Town argues that, in determining whether the Board's decision is supported by substantial evidence, we should not compare the relative merits of the two applications. Instead, we should simply focus on whether there is sufficient evidence in the record to reject the plaintiffs' application. Conversely, the plaintiffs claim that the Board's votes to deny their application and to grant American Tower's application should essentially be treated as one decision. This approach, then, would require the Board to provide substantial evidence for its decision to choose American Tower's application over the plaintiffs'.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the purposes of this appeal, we assume, without deciding, that the comparative model proposed by plaintiffs is the proper analytical framework. Even after employing this more exacting model, however, we find that the plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that the Board's selection of American Tower's bid instead of the plaintiffs' is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its written decision, the Board offered four reasons for rejecting the plaintiffs' application to construct a telecommunication tower. We address each justification in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Cooperation Among Service Providers</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first reason set forth in the Board's written decision for denying plaintiffs' application concerns the Town's responsibility to provide for minimal impact siting and to promote cooperation between competitors. Under the Telecommunications Facility Ordinance, the Town is required to limit the construction of telecommunication towers by encouraging cooperation between competitors and having as many wireless service providers on a single tower as possible. Art. VII, &#167; 7.80(II)(C). The Board felt that the plaintiffs' application did not adequately meet these objectives.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In defense of the Board's reliance on this factor, the Town cites persuasive evidence in the record to support the conclusion that only one tower was necessary to rectify the coverage gap. For instance, Tony Wells, a radio frequency engineer for American Tower, stated that \"the coverage for either [tower] proposal would be equivalent.\" In addition, Ivan Pagacik, an independent telecommunications consultant, informed the Board that \"[t]he proposed American Tower site at 140 feet does fill in th[e] [coverage] gap.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though this evidence may justify the Board's decision to construct only one tower, however, it provides no basis for choosing American Tower's application over the plaintiffs'. The crucial question, then, is whether the plaintiffs have shown that the Board's reliance on this factor to select American Tower's proposal over the plaintiffs' is not supported by substantial evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Both SBA/ATC and American Tower assured the Planning Board that they would allow competing wireless service providers to use the antenna facilities on their towers. The only difference between the proposals is that whereas the plaintiffs' proposed tower could accommodate six wireless service providers, American Tower could only hold five providers on its tower. Thus, in terms of willingness to cooperate and ability to serve wireless companies, the proposals are virtually identical, with the plaintiffs' application being marginally better.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Impact on Residential Properties and Neighborhood Aesthetics</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board's second reason for denying plaintiffs' application for a conditional use permit was that their proposed tower was too close to residential abutters and had an adverse impact on neighborhood aesthetics. Under the Telecommunications Facility Ordinance, the Town is authorized to consider the proximity of proposed towers to residential development and their impact on the surrounding aesthetics. Art. VII, &#167; 7.80(II)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two proposed sites are largely indistinguishable with respect to their proximity to residential areas. Both sites have residential abutters and commercial businesses within close proximity. They are also essentially equidistant from the areas zoned for commercial use. Thus, the proposals are quite similar, if not identical, with respect to this factor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In regard to the aesthetic impact of the towers, the Board considered comments from residential abutters to the proposed sites. <i>See, e.g., Todd,</i> 244 F.3d at 61 (finding substantial evidence of adverse visual impact where residents specifically complained that the proposed tower was of a different magnitude than anything else in the vicinity and was inconsistent with the residential uses around it). Several residential neighbors to the plaintiffs' site criticized SBA/ATC's tower for its adverse aesthetic impact. Resident abutters Elisha and Steven Blaisdell objected to the proposed tower, arguing that it would destroy the \"picturesque\" quality of the surrounding area. Mariah Champagne submitted a letter characterizing plaintiffs' tower as an \"eyesore\" that should be situated in a more rural location. She also took issue with the fact that the tower would be located on property that was once listed by the state as being historically significant. Tina Staublin echoed concerns over the adverse aesthetic impact the tower would have on the neighborhood. Finally, Andrea and Almus Kenter expressed their displeasure over having a \"clear view\" of the proposed tower from their home. They also emphasized the fact that the tower's construction would be inconsistent with the surrounding bucolic area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, nearly forty percent of the residential abutters to the plaintiffs' proposed site opposed the application on aesthetic grounds. Conversely, the Board did not receive a single aesthetic objection to the American Tower proposal. Moreover, at least one Board member attended a crane test on American Tower's proposed site, which involved elevating a crane to 180 feet to determine the visibility of the proposed tower from the surrounding neighborhood. The results of the test demonstrated that \"the crane was very difficult to see,\" which may explain why no aesthetic objections were made to the American Tower proposal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs largely ignore the results of this empirical test and concentrate their attack on what they perceive to be the easier target: the residential abutters' comments. SBA/ATC argue that local residents cannot defeat a tower proposal merely by trumpeting \"negative comments that are applicable to any tower, regardless of location.\" <i>Todd,</i> 244 F.3d at 61. Because they characterize the residential abutters' comments as generalized aesthetic objections, plaintiffs conclude that the Board incorrectly relied upon this evidence to distinguish between the two proposals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though several of the abutters' objections to the visual impact of the plaintiffs' tower specifically addressed why the proposed facility was inappropriate for the chosen site, we will assume, for the sake of argument, that the abutters' comments were so general that they could apply to any tower. Even assuming as much, however, the Board correctly relied on this evidence in light of the facts of this unusual case. As noted, courts have consistently held that a \"few generalized expressions of concern with `aesthetics' cannot serve as substantial evidence on which [a town] could base [a] denial.\" <i>Oyster Bay,</i> 166 F.3d at 496. However, these rulings have not been made in the context of a town deciding between two proposed towers. Rather, they have been made in cases in which towns have rejected the only proposed tower application before them. <i>See,</i> <i>e.g., Todd,</i> 244 F.3d at 52; <i>Preferred Sites v. Troup County,</i> 296 F.3d 1210, 1214 (11th Cir.2002); <i>Telespectrum, Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n of Ky.,</i> 227 F.3d 414, 418 (6th Cir.2000); <i>Omnipoint Corp. v. Zoning Hearing Bd. of Pine Grove,</i> 181 F.3d 403, 407 (3d Cir.1999). In the latter context, courts fear that local governments may be relying on abutters' general aesthetic objections to mask a de facto prohibition of wireless service. <i>See generally Todd,</i> 244 F.3d at 61.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast, the instant case, given the mode of analysis we have employed, involves the Board's comparison between two competing proposals and its selection of American Tower's application over the plaintiffs'. The fact that the Board ultimately granted a permit to the plaintiffs' competitor demonstrates that the Board is not generally hostile to the construction of telecommunication towers. In this context, when a planning board has decided to construct a tower and must decide which of several proposed towers to construct, it is perfectly reasonable for the Board to consider, and be swayed by, the general aesthetic concerns of residential abutters, especially where, as here, the proposed towers are otherwise virtually identical.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, whereas both applications are identical with respect to proximity to residential abutters, there is undisputed evidence that the plaintiffs' application would have a stronger adverse aesthetic impact on the surrounding neighborhood.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Visual Intrusiveness Along Route 125</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board based its third reason for rejecting plaintiffs' application on the fact that \"the design of the [SBA/ATC] tower does not reduce visual intrusiveness along the Route 125 corridor.\" Though the record supports the Board's conclusion, it also indicates that both proposed towers would be visible from Route 125. However, the best evidence of minimal visual intrusiveness came after a Board member conducted a visual inspection of the American Tower site from Route 125. She concluded that she \"could hardly see [the tower] with the exception of one small spot.... She thought that if she were not looking for [the tower], it would not be seen.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Plaintiffs have presented no evidence to challenge this observation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D. <i>Failure to Exhaust Alternative Opportunities</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final reason for denying SBA/ATC's application for a conditional use permit was that plaintiffs had failed to exhaust all other reasonable opportunities. Pursuant to the Telecommunications Facility Ordinance, the Board is directed to \"[p]ermit the construction of new towers only where all other reasonable opportunities have been exhausted.\" Art. VII, &#167; 7.80(II)(D).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only other reasonable opportunity available here was the competing proposal. However, the plaintiffs submitted their application to the Planning Board two months prior to American Tower's application. Thus, at the time SBA/ATC applied, American Tower's non-existent application could not have provided a reasonable opportunity that the plaintiffs were required to exhaust.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board also rejected the plaintiffs' application because it found that plaintiffs had failed to consider the availability of existing sites. More specifically, because the Board granted American Tower's application before its final vote to reject the plaintiffs' application, the Board decided not to approve the plaintiffs' application because a reasonable alternative opportunity existed &#8212; that is, American Tower's recently approved site.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, given the comparative framework we have employed, this factor does not provide a basis for choosing American Tower's proposal over the plaintiffs'. It assumes that American Tower has been selected and faults the plaintiffs for not exploring that existing option. Thus, this justification assumes precisely what we are trying to determine: whether there is substantial evidence in the record to support the Board's selection of American Tower's proposal over the plaintiffs'.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. <i>The Results</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reviewing the record, we find that the plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that the Board's selection was not supported by substantial evidence. The Planning Board was presented with two proposed towers that were virtually identical: the towers were of the same height; covered the same area; accommodated almost the same number of wireless providers; could be seen, in comparable fashion, from Route 125; had residential abutters; and were roughly equidistant from commercial zones. There is only one substantive difference between the proposed towers: unlike American Tower's application, plaintiffs' proposal engendered much opposition due to its adverse impact on the surrounding neighborhood aesthetic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We must reiterate that our review is not focused on whether the Planning Board made the best or the correct decision. <i>See AT &amp; T Wireless PCS, Inc. v. Winston-Salem Zoning Bd. of Adjustment,</i> 172 F.3d 307, 314 (4th Cir.1999) (\"The reviewing court cannot replace the agency's judgment, even if the court could have reached a justifiably different conclusion between two conflicting views had it reviewed the matter <i>de novo.</i>\"). Rather, we must simply determine whether the plaintiffs have demonstrated that the Board's decision to choose American Tower's application over their application is supported by substantial evidence. Given the extreme similarity between the two proposals, and the Board's justifiable reliance on abutter comments to distinguish between them, we find that more than a scintilla of evidence exists to support the Board's decision and direct the district court to enter summary judgment in favor of the Town.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case comes to us after a decision based on cross motions for summary judgment. Cross motions do not necessarily indicate agreement by the parties as to the material facts in the record. <i>See Boston Five Cents Sav. Bank v. Sec'y of the Dep't of Hous. and Urban Dev.,</i> 768 F.2d 5, 11-12 (1st Cir.1985); <i>Wiley v. Am. Greetings Corp.,</i> 762 F.2d 139, 140-41 (1st Cir.1985). But here, as we have stressed, the basis for decision is limited to the factual record that was before the Board. In this situation, it is appropriate for an appellate court to not only reverse a grant of summary judgment for one party, but direct its entry to the other party. <i>See Wightman</i> <i>v. Springfield Terminal Ry. Co.,</i> 100 F.3d 228 (1st Cir.1996) (\"Cross motions simply require us to determine whether <i>either</i> of the parties deserves judgment as a matter of law on facts that are not disputed.\" (emphasis added)). Because there is substantial evidence in the undisputed facts before the Board to support its decision, we direct entry of summary judgment for the Board and dismissal of this case. Our decision is further supported by the clear aim of the TCA, echoed in our precedents, of expediting resolution of litigation over placement of wireless telecommunication facilities. <i>See</i> 47 U.S.C. &#167; 332(c)(7)(B)(v) (establishing expedited process for such challenges); <i>Nat'l Tower,</i> 297 F.3d at 24-25.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>CONCLUSION</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we <i>reverse</i> the district court's grant of summary judgment and <i>enter</i> summary judgment in favor of the Town.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Like many municipalities, Kingston has enacted an ordinance that regulates the siting of wireless telecommunication towers<i>See</i> Kingston, N.H., Zoning &amp; Building Codes art. VII, &#167; 7.80 (1997) (\"Telecommunications Facility Ordinance\"). Under the ordinance, an applicant seeking to build such a facility must obtain a conditional use permit from the Kingston Planning Board. <i>See id.</i></p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Pagacik noted, however, that American Tower's proposal to construct a 140-foot tower would provide minimal overlap with the coverage provided by nearby towers. This decreased overlap would likely affect the ability of mobile telephone users to make a successful transition from coverage provided by an antenna on one tower to coverage provided by an antenna on another tower</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion, however, is largely irrelevant because the Planning Board granted American Tower permission to construct a tower 40 feet higher than the height at which Pagacik conducted his tests. As plaintiffs' counsel conceded at oral argument, the higher a tower is, the stronger coverage it provides. Thus, it is reasonable to infer, especially at the summary judgment level, that the 40-foot increase in the tower's height went a long way in fixing any overlap deficiency. General support for drawing this inference can be found in SBA/ATC's own experimental tests, which show that the \"coverage gap could not be filled at 140 [feet],\" but it could be filled at 180 feet.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Pagacik allegedly told several Board members, without ambiguity, that only one tower was necessary since either of the proposed towers would suffice to cover the service gap.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Because the Board specifically dealt with minimal impact siting in its other reasons for rejecting plaintiffs' application, we reserve our discussion on that issue until it is more pertinent</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Plaintiffs also argue that the inferiority of the American Tower proposal is evidenced by the fact that American Tower still has not been able to lease the antenna facilities on its tower to any wireless service provider, despite the fact that its application was approved by the Board</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">However, it is too speculative to attribute American Tower's inability to contract with any wireless service providers to its tower's inferiority. The dearth of clientele may be a product of the fact that wireless service companies are waiting to see the outcome of this litigation before committing to one tower or waiting to see if two towers are constructed in the Town, thereby maximizing competition and reducing lease rates. We thus give no weight to plaintiffs' speculative argument.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Presumably, this visual test was conducted when the crane, substituting for the tower, was in place</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Plaintiffs also fault the Board for failing to consider the visual impact that the American Tower proposal would have on property with historical significance<i>See</i> Telecommunications Facility Ordinance art.

In this regard, several Board members observed that the plaintiffs' proposal would have no visual impact on the historic district; however, no such finding was made with respect to the American Tower proposal.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Though no specific finding was made regarding the visual impact that the American Tower proposal would have on the historic district of Kingston, the Board conducted several photographic simulations illustrating the view of the proposed tower from several locations.

The district court granted summary judgment in plaintiffs' favor on the ground that there was insufficient evidence to support the Town of Kingston's decision to deny plaintiffs' application to construct a tower. Defendant-appellant Town of Kingston (\"Town\" or \"Kingston\") appeals the district court's grant of summary judgment, arguing that the Town's rejection of the plaintiffs' application is supported by substantial evidence. Because we conclude that there was substantial evidence to support the Town's decision in the record, we reverse entry of summary judgment for plaintiffs and direct that summary judgment be entered for the Town.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wireless service companies provide consumers with mobile telephone service. To activate the technology upon which their service relies, these companies must construct a network of telecommunication towers that transmits low-power, high-frequency radio signals. Incapable of building this network alone, they rely on plaintiffs SBA Towers and ATC Realty (collectively, \"SBA/ATC\") to develop such telecommunication towers for them. Plaintiffs, in turn, lease antenna facilities on these towers to the wireless service companies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1999, several wireless service providers noticed a significant coverage gap along Route 125 in the northern region of Kingston, New Hampshire. This gap left customers in the area without wireless telecommunications service and disconnected the telephone calls of mobile phone users passing through the gap. Seeking to rectify this problem, SBA/ATC applied to the Kingston Planning Board (\"Planning Board\" or \"Board\") for permission to construct \"an unlighted 180 foot free standing multi-user telecommunication tower\" on Marshall Road in Kingston.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Two months after the plaintiffs submitted their application, however, American Tower, a direct competitor, applied for a permit to construct a similar tower on Depot Road in Kingston.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After holding several public hearings, conducting on-site inspections of the proposed tower locations, and consulting a telecommunications expert, the Planning Board voted on October 17, 2000, to approve the construction of only one of the two proposed towers. In the same meeting, the Board voted to deny the plaintiffs' application for a construction permit and, in a subsequent vote, to grant American Tower's application. Finally, the Board voted again to deny plaintiffs' application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly thereafter, the Planning Board issued a written decision formally adopting the results of the votes taken at the October 17 meeting. Using the Town's Telecommunications Facility Ordinance to define its criteria, the Board rejected the plaintiffs' application on four grounds:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1) Based upon the purposes section of the Kingston zoning ordinance letters C and E it is the responsibility of the Kingston Planning board to provide for minimal impact siting and to require cooperation and coordination between telecommunications service providers in order to reduce cumulative negative impacts upon Kingston.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2) The location of [SBA/ATC's] proposed location is in close proximity to residential abutters.

The Town argues that, in determining whether the Board's decision is supported by substantial evidence, we should not compare the relative merits of the two applications. Instead, we should simply focus on whether there is sufficient evidence in the record to reject the plaintiffs' application. Conversely, the plaintiffs claim that the Board's votes to deny their application and to grant American Tower's application should essentially be treated as one decision. This approach, then, would require the Board to provide substantial evidence for its decision to choose American Tower's application over the plaintiffs'.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the purposes of this appeal, we assume, without deciding, that the comparative model proposed by plaintiffs is the proper analytical framework. Even after employing this more exacting model, however, we find that the plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that the Board's selection of American Tower's bid instead of the plaintiffs' is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its written decision, the Board offered four reasons for rejecting the plaintiffs' application to construct a telecommunication tower. We address each justification in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Cooperation Among Service Providers</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first reason set forth in the Board's written decision for denying plaintiffs' application concerns the Town's responsibility to provide for minimal impact siting and to promote cooperation between competitors. Under the Telecommunications Facility Ordinance, the Town is required to limit the construction of telecommunication towers by encouraging cooperation between competitors and having as many wireless service providers on a single tower as possible. Art. VII, &#167; 7.80(II)(C). The Board felt that the plaintiffs' application did not adequately meet these objectives.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In defense of the Board's reliance on this factor, the Town cites persuasive evidence in the record to support the conclusion that only one tower was necessary to rectify the coverage gap. For instance, Tony Wells, a radio frequency engineer for American Tower, stated that \"the coverage for either [tower] proposal would be equivalent.\" In addition, Ivan Pagacik, an independent telecommunications consultant, informed the Board that \"[t]he proposed American Tower site at 140 feet does fill in th[e] [coverage] gap.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though this evidence may justify the Board's decision to construct only one tower, however, it provides no basis for choosing American Tower's application over the plaintiffs'. The crucial question, then, is whether the plaintiffs have shown that the Board's reliance on this factor to select American Tower's proposal over the plaintiffs' is not supported by substantial evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Both SBA/ATC and American Tower assured the Planning Board that they would allow competing wireless service providers to use the antenna facilities on their towers. The only difference between the proposals is that whereas the plaintiffs' proposed tower could accommodate six wireless service providers, American Tower could only hold five providers on its tower. Thus, in terms of willingness to cooperate and ability to serve wireless companies, the proposals are virtually identical, with the plaintiffs' application being marginally better.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Impact on Residential Properties and Neighborhood Aesthetics</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board's second reason for denying plaintiffs' application for a conditional use permit was that their proposed tower was too close to residential abutters and had an adverse impact on neighborhood aesthetics. Under the Telecommunications Facility Ordinance, the Town is authorized to consider the proximity of proposed towers to residential development and their impact on the surrounding aesthetics. Art. VII, &#167; 7.80(II)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two proposed sites are largely indistinguishable with respect to their proximity to residential areas. Both sites have residential abutters and commercial businesses within close proximity. They are also essentially equidistant from the areas zoned for commercial use. Thus, the proposals are quite similar, if not identical, with respect to this factor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In regard to the aesthetic impact of the towers, the Board considered comments from residential abutters to the proposed sites. <i>See, e.g., Todd,</i> 244 F.3d at 61 (finding substantial evidence of adverse visual impact where residents specifically complained that the proposed tower was of a different magnitude than anything else in the vicinity and was inconsistent with the residential uses around it). Several residential neighbors to the plaintiffs' site criticized SBA/ATC's tower for its adverse aesthetic impact. Resident abutters Elisha and Steven Blaisdell objected to the proposed tower, arguing that it would destroy the \"picturesque\" quality of the surrounding area. Mariah Champagne submitted a letter characterizing plaintiffs' tower as an \"eyesore\" that should be situated in a more rural location. She also took issue with the fact that the tower would be located on property that was once listed by the state as being historically significant. Tina Staublin echoed concerns over the adverse aesthetic impact the tower would have on the neighborhood. Finally, Andrea and Almus Kenter expressed their displeasure over having a \"clear view\" of the proposed tower from their home. They also emphasized the fact that the tower's construction would be inconsistent with the surrounding bucolic area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, nearly forty percent of the residential abutters to the plaintiffs' proposed site opposed the application on aesthetic grounds. Conversely, the Board did not receive a single aesthetic objection to the American Tower proposal. Moreover, at least one Board member attended a crane test on American Tower's proposed site, which involved elevating a crane to 180 feet to determine the visibility of the proposed tower from the surrounding neighborhood. The results of the test demonstrated that \"the crane was very difficult to see,\" which may explain why no aesthetic objections were made to the American Tower proposal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs largely ignore the results of this empirical test and concentrate their attack on what they perceive to be the easier target: the residential abutters' comments. SBA/ATC argue that local residents cannot defeat a tower proposal merely by trumpeting \"negative comments that are applicable to any tower, regardless of location.\" <i>Todd,</i> 244 F.3d at 61. Because they characterize the residential abutters' comments as generalized aesthetic objections, plaintiffs conclude that the Board incorrectly relied upon this evidence to distinguish between the two proposals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though several of the abutters' objections to the visual impact of the plaintiffs' tower specifically addressed why the proposed facility was inappropriate for the chosen site, we will assume, for the sake of argument, that the abutters' comments were so general that they could apply to any tower. Even assuming as much, however, the Board correctly relied on this evidence in light of the facts of this unusual case. As noted, courts have consistently held that a \"few generalized expressions of concern with `aesthetics' cannot serve as substantial evidence on which [a town] could base [a] denial.\" <i>Oyster Bay,</i> 166 F.3d at 496. However, these rulings have not been made in the context of a town deciding between two proposed towers. Rather, they have been made in cases in which towns have rejected the only proposed tower application before them. <i>See,</i> <i>e.g., Todd,</i> 244 F.3d at 52; <i>Preferred Sites v.

In the latter context, courts fear that local governments may be relying on abutters' general aesthetic objections to mask a de facto prohibition of wireless service. <i>See generally Todd,</i> 244 F.3d at 61.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast, the instant case, given the mode of analysis we have employed, involves the Board's comparison between two competing proposals and its selection of American Tower's application over the plaintiffs'. The fact that the Board ultimately granted a permit to the plaintiffs' competitor demonstrates that the Board is not generally hostile to the construction of telecommunication towers. In this context, when a planning board has decided to construct a tower and must decide which of several proposed towers to construct, it is perfectly reasonable for the Board to consider, and be swayed by, the general aesthetic concerns of residential abutters, especially where, as here, the proposed towers are otherwise virtually identical.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, whereas both applications are identical with respect to proximity to residential abutters, there is undisputed evidence that the plaintiffs' application would have a stronger adverse aesthetic impact on the surrounding neighborhood.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Visual Intrusiveness Along Route 125</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board based its third reason for rejecting plaintiffs' application on the fact that \"the design of the [SBA/ATC] tower does not reduce visual intrusiveness along the Route 125 corridor.\" Though the record supports the Board's conclusion, it also indicates that both proposed towers would be visible from Route 125. However, the best evidence of minimal visual intrusiveness came after a Board member conducted a visual inspection of the American Tower site from Route 125. She concluded that she \"could hardly see [the tower] with the exception of one small spot.... She thought that if she were not looking for [the tower], it would not be seen.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Plaintiffs have presented no evidence to challenge this observation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D. <i>Failure to Exhaust Alternative Opportunities</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final reason for denying SBA/ATC's application for a conditional use permit was that plaintiffs had failed to exhaust all other reasonable opportunities. Pursuant to the Telecommunications Facility Ordinance, the Board is directed to \"[p]ermit the construction of new towers only where all other reasonable opportunities have been exhausted.\" Art. VII, &#167; 7.80(II)(D).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only other reasonable opportunity available here was the competing proposal. However, the plaintiffs submitted their application to the Planning Board two months prior to American Tower's application. Thus, at the time SBA/ATC applied, American Tower's non-existent application could not have provided a reasonable opportunity that the plaintiffs were required to exhaust.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board also rejected the plaintiffs' application because it found that plaintiffs had failed to consider the availability of existing sites. More specifically, because the Board granted American Tower's application before its final vote to reject the plaintiffs' application, the Board decided not to approve the plaintiffs' application because a reasonable alternative opportunity existed &#8212; that is, American Tower's recently approved site.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, given the comparative framework we have employed, this factor does not provide a basis for choosing American Tower's proposal over the plaintiffs'. It assumes that American Tower has been selected and faults the plaintiffs for not exploring that existing option. Thus, this justification assumes precisely what we are trying to determine: whether there is substantial evidence in the record to support the Board's selection of American Tower's proposal over the plaintiffs'.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. <i>The Results</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reviewing the record, we find that the plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that the Board's selection was not supported by substantial evidence. The Planning Board was presented with two proposed towers that were virtually identical: the towers were of the same height; covered the same area; accommodated almost the same number of wireless providers; could be seen, in comparable fashion, from Route 125; had residential abutters; and were roughly equidistant from commercial zones. There is only one substantive difference between the proposed towers: unlike American Tower's application, plaintiffs' proposal engendered much opposition due to its adverse impact on the surrounding neighborhood aesthetic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We must reiterate that our review is not focused on whether the Planning Board made the best or the correct decision. <i>See AT &amp; T Wireless PCS, Inc. v.

Rather, we must simply determine whether the plaintiffs have demonstrated that the Board's decision to choose American Tower's application over their application is supported by substantial evidence. Given the extreme similarity between the two proposals, and the Board's justifiable reliance on abutter comments to distinguish between them, we find that more than a scintilla of evidence exists to support the Board's decision and direct the district court to enter summary judgment in favor of the Town.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case comes to us after a decision based on cross motions for summary judgment.

Because there is substantial evidence in the undisputed facts before the Board to support its decision, we direct entry of summary judgment for the Board and dismissal of this case. Our decision is further supported by the clear aim of the TCA, echoed in our precedents, of expediting resolution of litigation over placement of wireless telecommunication facilities. <i>See</i> 47 U.S.C. &#167; 332(c)(7)(B)(v) (establishing expedited process for such challenges); <i>Nat'l Tower,</i> 297 F.3d at 24-25.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>CONCLUSION</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we <i>reverse</i> the district court's grant of summary judgment and <i>enter</i> summary judgment in favor of the Town.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Like many municipalities, Kingston has enacted an ordinance that regulates the siting of wireless telecommunication towers<i>See</i> Kingston, N.H., Zoning &amp; Building Codes art. VII, &#167; 7.80 (1997) (\"Telecommunications Facility Ordinance\"). Under the ordinance, an applicant seeking to build such a facility must obtain a conditional use permit from the Kingston Planning Board. <i>See id.</i></p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Pagacik noted, however, that American Tower's proposal to construct a 140-foot tower would provide minimal overlap with the coverage provided by nearby towers. This decreased overlap would likely affect the ability of mobile telephone users to make a successful transition from coverage provided by an antenna on one tower to coverage provided by an antenna on another tower</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion, however, is largely irrelevant because the Planning Board granted American Tower permission to construct a tower 40 feet higher than the height at which Pagacik conducted his tests. As plaintiffs' counsel conceded at oral argument, the higher a tower is, the stronger coverage it provides. Thus, it is reasonable to infer, especially at the summary judgment level, that the 40-foot increase in the tower's height went a long way in fixing any overlap deficiency. General support for drawing this inference can be found in SBA/ATC's own experimental tests, which show that the \"coverage gap could not be filled at 140 [feet],\" but it could be filled at 180 feet.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Pagacik allegedly told several Board members, without ambiguity, that only one tower was necessary since either of the proposed towers would suffice to cover the service gap.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Because the Board specifically dealt with minimal impact siting in its other reasons for rejecting plaintiffs' application, we reserve our discussion on that issue until it is more pertinent</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Plaintiffs also argue that the inferiority of the American Tower proposal is evidenced by the fact that American Tower still has not been able to lease the antenna facilities on its tower to any wireless service provider, despite the fact that its application was approved by the Board</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">However, it is too speculative to attribute American Tower's inability to contract with any wireless service providers to its tower's inferiority. The dearth of clientele may be a product of the fact that wireless service companies are waiting to see the outcome of this litigation before committing to one tower or waiting to see if two towers are constructed in the Town, thereby maximizing competition and reducing lease rates. We thus give no weight to plaintiffs' speculative argument.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Presumably, this visual test was conducted when the crane, substituting for the tower, was in place</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Plaintiffs also fault the Board for failing to consider the visual impact that the American Tower proposal would have on property with historical significance<i>See</i> Telecommunications Facility Ordinance art. VII, &#167; 7.80(B) (stating that the Board may consider the impact that a proposed tower may have on \"historically significant locations\"). In this regard, several Board members observed that the plaintiffs' proposal would have no visual impact on the historic district; however, no such finding was made with respect to the American Tower proposal.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Though no specific finding was made regarding the visual impact that the American Tower proposal would have on the historic district of Kingston, the Board conducted several photographic simulations illustrating the view of the proposed tower from several locations. The Board also conducted an on-site inspection and took several aerial photos of the proposed tower. Neither the simulations nor the photographs indicates any visual intrusion on the historic district of Kingston.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
