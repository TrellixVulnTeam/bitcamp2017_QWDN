Defendant-appellant Jesús Alberto Uribe-\n\nLondoño (\"Uribe\") entered into a plea agreement on two counts of\n\nsexual exploitation of children in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2251\n\n(a).   He now appeals, arguing that the district court erred in\n\naccepting his guilty plea and abused its discretion in imposing a\n\n$15,000 fine.   We affirm.\n\n                             I.   Background\n\n          On March 22, 2000, Uribe, a Colombian national, arrived\n\nin Puerto Rico from the United States for a vacation.    He rented a\n\ncar and an apartment in Isla Verde.        From March 22, 2000 up to\n\nMarch 25, 2000, Uribe induced five different minors between the\n\nages of 12 and 16 to pose in sexually explicit poses and induced\n\nthree of the minors to exhibit their genitals and engage in sexual\n\nconduct involving oral and genital sexual intercourse with him.\n\nUribe videotaped this sexual conduct, and attempted to induce the\n\nother two minors to engage in similar conduct.         Uribe was in\n\npossession of the videotape and pornographic magazines depicting\n\nyoung people in sexually explicit poses.\n\n          On April 19, 2000, Uribe was indicted on five counts of\n\nsexual exploitation of children in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2251(a)\n\n(\"Counts One\" through \"Five\") and one count of activities relating\n\nto material involving sexual exploitation of children, in violation\n\nof 18 U.S.C. § 2252(a)(4)(B)(i)-(ii) (Count Six).       On March 14,\n\n2002, at a sidebar conference during a hearing before the United\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fStates District Court for the District of Puerto Rico,1 Uribe asked\n\nto address the court.       After the district court granted his\n\nrequest, Uribe stated that he was \"more than willing to reach an\n\nagreement in order to dispose of this case,\" that he had retained\n\nseveral attorneys for this purpose, and that \"the first thing that\n\nI told them was that I would like to get an agreement with the\n\nprosecution here.\"    During the course of his statement, Uribe\n\nexpressed frustration that it was the eve of trial and that he had\n\nnot received \"an offer from the U.S. Attorney's office,\" and told\n\nthe district court that he would like to try to reach a reasonable\n\nagreement.   Uribe also mentioned concerns regarding the amount of\n\nfees he had paid his attorneys.\n\n          The district court responded by asking Uribe several\n\nquestions regarding his relationship with his attorneys and how\n\nmuch he had paid them, and confirmed that Uribe had told his\n\nattorneys he wanted a plea agreement.     The district court then\n\nasked the government and Uribe's attorney what plea negotiations\n\nhad occurred in the case.   After lengthy responses from both sides\n\nexplaining what negotiations had occurred and why an agreement had\n\nnot been reached, and further discussion regarding attorney's fees,\n\nthe district court expressed concern over the amount of fees Uribe\n\nhad paid, stated that it was going to discuss the matter with the\n\n\n1\n  The judge presiding during this hearing was not the trial judge\nfor Uribe's case. The purpose of the hearing was to begin jury\nselection.\n\n                                -3-\n\ftrial judge, and stated that it was \"going to start jury selection\n\ntomorrow morning . . . . You should be prepared to select this\n\njury. You should be prepared to continue your plea negotiations if\n\nyou want to, and that's all without prejudice of me doing what I\n\nthink I have to do under the circumstances.\"              Towards the end of\n\nthe sidebar, after Uribe had again expressed his desire to reach a\n\nplea agreement, the district court told counsel for the government\n\nthat \"I want you . . . to apprise the U.S. attorney what happened\n\nhere    today   and   to   convey   to    him   my   concern   about   the   plea\n\nnegotiation.      I just want him to look at it again, that's all.\n\n. . .     I want him to look at it again from the standpoint of a\n\npotential disposition.\"\n\n            The next day, on March 15, 2002, Uribe pled guilty to\n\nCounts Three and Five of the indictment.                After a hearing, the\n\ndistrict court accepted Uribe's plea.                 On July 9, 2002, the\n\ndistrict court sentenced Uribe to 120 months imprisonment for each\n\ncount, to be served concurrently; a supervised release term of\n\nthree years for each count, to be served concurrently; and a fine\n\nof $15,000.       Uribe argues that the district court improperly\n\nparticipated in the negotiation and acceptance of his plea bargain,\n\nthat he received ineffective assistance of counsel, and that he was\n\nnever informed of the consequences his guilty plea would have on\n\nhis immigration status.       Uribe also argues that the district court\n\n\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fabused its discretion by not waiving the $15,000 fine.2               We discuss\n\neach argument in turn.\n\n                               II.   Discussion\n\n              Uribe begins by arguing that the record establishes that\n\nthe    district    court    improperly     involved   itself    in     the   plea\n\nnegotiations.      See Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1).3        As Uribe made no\n\nobjection below, our review is for plain error.           See United States\n\nv. Pagán-Ortega, 372 F.3d 22, 27 (1st Cir. 2004).                    \"Review for\n\nplain error entails four showings: (1) that an error occurred (2)\n\nwhich was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the\n\ndefendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the\n\nfairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"\n\nUnited States v. Negrón-Narváez, -- F.3d --, 2005 WL 779851, at *4\n\n(1st   Cir.    Apr.   7,   2005).    The    defendant   has    the    burden   of\n\nestablishing plain error, and we have characterized this burden as\n\n\"considerable.\"       Pagán-Ortega, 372 F.3d at 27.\n\n\n\n2\n   In response to many of Uribe's arguments, the government argues\nthat he has raised them in a perfunctory manner and therefore\nwaived them. See, e.g., United States v. Fox, 393 F.3d 52, 61 n.10\n(1st Cir. 2004)(\"[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,\nunaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed\nwaived.\") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).       We\nbypass the waiver issues as Uribe's claims are obviously meritless.\n3\n    The relevant portion of Rule 11(c)(1) reads:\n\n       (1) In General. An attorney for the government and the\n       defendant's attorney, or the defendant when proceeding\n       pro se, may discuss and reach a plea agreement.    The\n       court must not participate in these discussions.\n\n                                     -5-\n\f            After   carefully   reviewing   the   record   before   us,   we\n\nconclude that Uribe has failed to prove plain error.          While it is\n\ntrue that, at the sidebar conference on March 14, 2002, the\n\ndistrict court asked the attorneys what plea negotiations had\n\noccurred, and also told the attorney for the government to \"apprise\n\nthe U.S. attorney what happened here today and to convey to him my\n\nconcern about the plea negotiation,\" the court did so only in\n\nresponse to Uribe's own complaints and stated desire to reach a\n\nplea agreement.      Further, the district court did not in any way\n\nparticipate in any plea discussion, but simply inquired about the\n\nstatus of    any    plea   negotiations.    Finally,   and   perhaps    most\n\nimportantly, the district court made clear to counsel that the\n\ntrial process would continue and that whether any plea negotiations\n\noccurred was up to the parties' discretion:         \"I am going to start\n\njury selection tomorrow morning . . . . You should be prepared to\n\ncontinue your plea negotiations if you want to, and that's all\n\nwithout prejudice of me doing what I think I have to do under the\n\ncircumstances.\" (emphasis added).          In view of this, we find no\n\nerror, much less plain error, in the district court's inquiry about\n\nthe plea    negotiations.       Cf. Pagán-Ortega,    372   F.3d   at   27-28\n\n(finding no plain error where the district court had much heavier\n\ninvolvement in plea negotiations).\n\n            Uribe's second argument is that his plea was defective\n\nbecause of ineffective assistance of counsel.          This claim was not\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fmade before the district court, and the record is not developed\n\nregarding the elements of the claim. Cf. Strickland v. Washington,\n\n466 U.S. 668, 687-96 (1984)(setting forth and explaining the\n\nstandard for ineffective assistance of counsel claims).                   \"For over\n\ntwenty years, this court has held with monotonous regularity that\n\nfact-specific claims of ineffective assistance cannot make their\n\ndebut on direct review of criminal convictions, but, rather, must\n\noriginally be presented to, and acted upon by, the trial court.\"\n\nNegrón-Narváez,      2005    WL   at   *7   (internal       quotation    marks    and\n\ncitation   omitted).          While    we     have    occasionally       considered\n\nineffective assistance claims for the first time on direct review,\n\nwe have done so where \"the critical facts are not in dispute and\n\nthe   record    is     sufficiently         developed       to   allow      reasoned\n\nconsideration of the claim.\"            Id. (internal quotation marks and\n\ncitation omitted).         That is not the case here, and we therefore\n\n\"follow our usual practice and treat the ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel claim as prematurely raised.\"                 Id. (internal quotation\n\nmarks and citation omitted).           If Uribe chooses, this claim may be\n\nreasserted in an application for post-conviction relief brought\n\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\n           Uribe next argues that the district court failed to\n\ninform   him   of    the    consequences      his    plea    would   have    on   his\n\n\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fimmigration status.4      However, Uribe has not shown how the district\n\ncourt failed to inform him of the consequences of his plea.                  We\n\nbegin by noting that page two, paragraph two, of the plea agreement\n\nsigned by    Uribe   states   that   \"[t]he   defendant    is   a   Colombian\n\nnational,   and   knows    that   upon   conviction   he   will     become   an\n\naggravated felon upon conviction [sic] and deportable for life from\n\nthe United States.\"        During the Rule 11 colloquy, the district\n\ncourt asked Uribe if his attorneys had explained the elements and\n\nnature of the offenses charged and the possible penalties.              Uribe\n\nreplied that they had.      Later, the district court asked Uribe if he\n\nsaw the sentence on page two, paragraph two, of his plea agreement.\n\nUribe replied that he did.           Uribe has not explained how this\n\nexchange was insufficient to inform him of the consequences his of\n\nplea.   We need go no further, as we see no error in the Rule 11\n\ncolloquy, plain or otherwise.\n\n            Uribe's final argument is that the district court erred\n\nin imposing the $15,000 fine.        We review for abuse of discretion.\n\nUnited States v. Torres-Otero, 232 F.3d 24, 32 (1st Cir. 2000).5\n\n\n4\n   An alien convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude is\ninadmissible to the United States. See 8 U.S.C. § 1182.\n5\n   In his reply brief, Uribe argued for the first time that the\ndistrict court's imposition of the fine violated Blakely v.\nWashington, 124 S. Ct. 2531 (2004). Even assuming dubitante that\nBlakely were to apply to a fine imposed under the guidelines, the\nissue was not raised below and Uribe has not argued that there is\na reasonable probability of a lower fine were the case to be\nremanded. He has failed to meet the standard set forth in United\nStates v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 81-83 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                                     -8-\n\fUnder U.S.S.G. § 5E1.2(a), \"[t]he court shall impose a fine in all\n\ncases, except where the defendant establishes that he is unable to\n\npay and is not likely to become able to pay any fine.\"                 \"[T]he\n\ndefendant bears the burden of demonstrating that his . . . case\n\nwarrants an exception to the rule that a fine be imposed.\"            Torres-\n\nOtero, 232 F.3d at 32.\n\n            Uribe argues that he cannot pay the fine because he has\n\nexhausted all of his resources.            However, Uribe has offered no\n\naffirmative evidence to support this assertion.               Moreover, the\n\nPresentence Report (\"PSR\"), which based its calculations on Uribe's\n\nown financial statement, indicates that Uribe's net worth is\n\n$135,509, including around $30,000 located in savings and checking\n\naccounts.     \"[W]here a defendant fails to rebut factual assertions\n\nin a PSR, the district court is justified in relying on those\n\nassertions.\"      Id.   Given the PSR calculations and Uribe's failure\n\nto provide any evidence of an inability to pay, we conclude that\n\nthe district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a fine\n\nof $15,000.\n\n                             III.   Conclusion\n\n            For   the   reasons   stated    above,   the   district   court's\n\njudgment is affirmed.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\f",

From March 22, 2000 up to March 25, 2000, Uribe induced five different minors between the ages of 12 and 16 to pose in sexually explicit poses and induced three of the minors to exhibit their genitals and engage in sexual conduct involving oral and genital sexual intercourse with him. Uribe videotaped this sexual conduct, and attempted to induce the other two minors to engage in similar conduct.

On March 14, 2002, at a sidebar conference during a hearing before the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Uribe asked to address the court. After the district court granted his request, Uribe stated that he was \"more than willing to reach an agreement in order to dispose of this case,\" that he had retained several attorneys for this purpose, and that \"the first thing that I told them was that I would like to get an agreement with the prosecution here.\" During the course of his statement, Uribe expressed frustration that it was the eve of trial and that he had not received \"an offer from the U.S. Attorney's office,\" and told the district court that he would like to try to reach a reasonable agreement.

You should be prepared to select this jury. You should be prepared to continue your plea negotiations if you want to, and that's all without prejudice of me doing what I think I have to do under the circumstances.\" Towards the end of the sidebar, after Uribe had again expressed his desire to reach a plea agreement, the district court told counsel for the government that \"I want you ... to apprise the U.S. attorney what happened here today and to convey to him my concern about the plea negotiation.

On July 9, 2002, the district court sentenced Uribe to 120 months imprisonment for each count, to be served concurrently; a supervised release term of three years for each count, to be served concurrently; and a fine of $15,000. Uribe argues that the district court improperly participated in the negotiation and acceptance of his plea bargain, that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, and that he was never informed of the consequences his guilty plea would have on his immigration status. Uribe also argues that the district court abused its discretion by not waiving the $15,000 fine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> We discuss each argument in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Discussion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Uribe begins by arguing that the record establishes that the district court improperly involved itself in the plea negotiations. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> As Uribe made no objection below, our review is for plain error. <i>See United States v.</i> <i>Pag&#225;n-Ortega,</i> 372 F.3d 22, 27 (1st Cir. 2004). \"Review for plain error entails four showings: (1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v.

While it is true that, at the sidebar conference on March 14, 2002, the district court asked the attorneys what plea negotiations had occurred, and also told the attorney for the government to \"apprise the U.S. attorney what happened here today and to convey to him my concern about the plea negotiation,\" the court did so only in response to Uribe's own complaints and stated desire to reach a plea agreement. Further, the district court did not in any way participate in any plea discussion, but simply inquired about the status of any plea negotiations. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the district court made clear to counsel that the trial process would continue and that whether any plea negotiations occurred was up to the parties' discretion: \"I am going to start jury selection tomorrow morning....

In view of this, we find no error, much less plain error, in the district court's inquiry about the plea negotiations. <i>Cf.

This claim was not made before the district court, and the record is not developed regarding the elements of the claim. <i>Cf. Strickland v. Washington,</i> 466 U.S. 668, 687-96, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984)(setting forth and explaining the standard for ineffective assistance of counsel claims). \"For over twenty years, this court has held with monotonous regularity that fact-specific claims of ineffective assistance cannot make their debut on direct review of criminal convictions, but, rather, must originally be presented to, and acted upon by, the trial court.\" <i>Negr&#243;n-Narv&#225;ez,</i> 403 F.3d at 40 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).

Uribe replied that they had. Later, the district court asked Uribe if he saw the sentence on page two, paragraph two, of his plea agreement. Uribe replied that he did. Uribe has not explained how this exchange was insufficient to inform him of the consequences his of plea.

He now appeals, arguing that the district court erred in accepting his guilty plea and abused its discretion in imposing a $15,000 fine. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 22, 2000, Uribe, a Colombian national, arrived in Puerto Rico from the United States for a vacation. He rented a car and an apartment in Isla Verde. From March 22, 2000 up to March 25, 2000, Uribe induced five different minors between the ages of 12 and 16 to pose in sexually explicit poses and induced three of the minors to exhibit their genitals and engage in sexual conduct involving oral and genital sexual intercourse with him. Uribe videotaped this sexual conduct, and attempted to induce the other two minors to engage in similar conduct. Uribe was in possession of the videotape and pornographic magazines depicting young people in sexually explicit poses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 19, 2000, Uribe was indicted on five counts of sexual exploitation of children in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2251(a) (\"Counts One\" through \"Five\") and one count of activities relating to material involving sexual exploitation of children, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2252(a)(4)(B)(i)-(ii) (Count Six). On March 14, 2002, at a sidebar conference during a hearing before the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Uribe asked to address the court. After the district court granted his request, Uribe stated that he was \"more than willing to reach an agreement in order to dispose of this case,\" that he had retained several attorneys for this purpose, and that \"the first thing that I told them was that I would like to get an agreement with the prosecution here.\" During the course of his statement, Uribe expressed frustration that it was the eve of trial and that he had not received \"an offer from the U.S. Attorney's office,\" and told the district court that he would like to try to reach a reasonable agreement. Uribe also mentioned concerns regarding the amount of fees he had paid his attorneys.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court responded by asking Uribe several questions regarding his relationship with his attorneys and how much he had paid them, and confirmed that Uribe had told his attorneys he wanted a plea agreement. The district court then asked the government and Uribe's attorney what plea negotiations had occurred in the case. After lengthy responses from both sides explaining what negotiations had occurred and why an agreement had not been reached, and further discussion regarding attorney's fees, the district court expressed concern over the amount of fees Uribe had paid, stated that it was going to discuss the matter with the trial judge, and stated that it was \"going to start jury selection tomorrow morning.... You should be prepared to select this jury. You should be prepared to continue your plea negotiations if you want to, and that's all without prejudice of me doing what I think I have to do under the circumstances.\" Towards the end of the sidebar, after Uribe had again expressed his desire to reach a plea agreement, the district court told counsel for the government that \"I want you ... to apprise the U.S. attorney what happened here today and to convey to him my concern about the plea negotiation. I just want him to look at it again, that's all.... I want him to look at it again from the standpoint of a potential disposition.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day, on March 15, 2002, Uribe pled guilty to Counts Three and Five of the indictment. After a hearing, the district court accepted Uribe's plea. On July 9, 2002, the district court sentenced Uribe to 120 months imprisonment for each count, to be served concurrently; a supervised release term of three years for each count, to be served concurrently; and a fine of $15,000. Uribe argues that the district court improperly participated in the negotiation and acceptance of his plea bargain, that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, and that he was never informed of the consequences his guilty plea would have on his immigration status. Uribe also argues that the district court abused its discretion by not waiving the $15,000 fine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> We discuss each argument in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Discussion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Uribe begins by arguing that the record establishes that the district court improperly involved itself in the plea negotiations. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> As Uribe made no objection below, our review is for plain error. <i>See United States v.</i> <i>Pag&#225;n-Ortega,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201059\"><a href=\"/opinion/201059/united-states-v-pagan-ortega/\"><span class=\"volume\">372</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 27 (1st Cir. 2004). \"Review for plain error entails four showings: (1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v.

The defendant has the burden of establishing plain error, and we have characterized this burden as \"considerable.\" <i>Pag&#225;n-Ortega,</i> 372 F.3d at 27.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After carefully reviewing the record before us, we conclude that Uribe has failed to prove plain error. While it is true that, at the sidebar conference on March 14, 2002, the district court asked the attorneys what plea negotiations had occurred, and also told the attorney for the government to \"apprise the U.S. attorney what happened here today and to convey to him my concern about the plea negotiation,\" the court did so only in response to Uribe's own complaints and stated desire to reach a plea agreement. Further, the district court did not in any way participate in any plea discussion, but simply inquired about the status of any plea negotiations. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the district court made clear to counsel that the trial process would continue and that whether any plea negotiations occurred was up to the parties' discretion: \"I am going to start jury selection tomorrow morning.... You should be prepared to continue your plea negotiations <i>if you want to,</i> and that's all without prejudice of me doing what I think I have to do under the circumstances.\" (emphasis added). In view of this, we find no error, much less plain error, in the district court's inquiry about the plea negotiations. <i>Cf. Pag&#225;n-Ortega,</i> 372 F.3d at 27-28 (finding no plain error where the district court had much heavier involvement in plea negotiations).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Uribe's second argument is that his plea was defective because of ineffective assistance of counsel.
