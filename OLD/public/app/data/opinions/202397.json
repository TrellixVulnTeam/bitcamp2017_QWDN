After carefully considering the briefs and\n\nrecord on appeal, we affirm the Commissioner’s decision.\n\n           We review the ALJ’s decision under the same standard as\n\nthe district court to ensure that it was rendered under the proper\n\nlegal standards and supported by substantial evidence.          42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 405(g); Seavey v. Barnhart, 276 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2001).         We will\n\nnot consider new evidence not presented to the Commissioner.            See\n\nMills v. Apfel, 244 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n           Although the appellant suffered pain, the ALJ could\n\nreasonably find that it was less severe than alleged.         Among other\n\nfactors,   one   provider’s    report   of   substantial   limitation   was\n\ncontradicted by other providers’ and reviewers’ reports of less\n\nextreme debility.     The record as a whole provided substantial\n\nevidence for the ALJ’s finding.           Avery v. Sec’y Health & Human\n\nServs., 797 F.2d 19 (1st Cir. 1986).            The ALJ’s resolution of\n\nevidentiary conflicts must be upheld if supported by substantial\n\nevidence, even if contrary results might have been tenable also.\n\nRodriguez Pagan v. Sec’y Health & Human Servs., 819 F.2d 1 (1st Cir.\n\n1987).\n\n           The appellant’s remaining arguments are unavailing.          The\n\nrecord contained ample evidence of the appellant’s capacities. The\n\nALJ did not interpret raw medical data or substitute his opinion\n\nfor the professionals’.       Despite other ambiguities, the vocational\n\nexpert clearly rendered the opinion that substantial work was\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\favailable, given the appellant’s exertional limitations and need\n\nfor a sit/stand option.\n\n          Affirmed.   1st Cir.
