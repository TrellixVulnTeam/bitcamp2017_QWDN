Richard G. Stearns, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n                 Lynch and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Michael L. Cohen with whom Michael J. Pollack, Cohen & Buckley\nLLP, Arnold Greenhut and Rosen Greenhut Catuogno & Low were on\nbrief for appellant.\n     Lloyd A. Gura with whom Lawrence S. Greengrass, Sanjit Shah,\nMound Cotton Wollan & Greengrass and Prince, Lobel, Glovsky & Tye\nLLP were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          March 23, 2005\n\f             Per   Curiam.       Nationwide     Mutual    Insurance       Company\n\n(“Nationwide”) appeals from the district court’s order denying an\n\naward   of   attorneys’      fees.    Nationwide    and    another    insurance\n\ncompany, Employers Insurance of Wausau (“Wausau”), prevailed in\n\nbringing emergency motions against First State Insurance Group\n\n(“First State”) in the district court.              They secured an order\n\nenjoining First State from pursuing its requests in a number of\n\narbitrations to have those disputes consolidated into just two\n\narbitrations. Viewing First State’s requests to the arbitrators as\n\ncontravening the court’s prior rulings, the court ordered that\n\nFirst State pay Wausau’s and Nationwide’s costs and attorneys’ fees\n\nin bringing the emergency motions “in a reasonable amount to be\n\ndetermined by the court on the parties’ submissions.”\n\n             Wausau sought reimbursement of $46,312.47; Nationwide\n\nsought $89,012.82.        The district court disallowed certain of\n\nWausau’s expenses       and   fees   and    concluded    that   $35,101    was   a\n\nreasonable     award.     Viewing     Nationwide’s       request   as     grossly\n\nexcessive for the amount of work involved, the court declined to\n\nmake any award to it.         The court then denied Nationwide’s motion\n\nfor reconsideration, which was accompanied by an application for a\n\nsomewhat reduced fee.         Nationwide now appeals from the denials of\n\nfees.\n\n             We review awards (and denials of awards) of attorneys’\n\nfees for abuse of discretion.         See Mullane v. Chambers, 333 F.3d\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f322, 337-38 (1st Cir. 2003); New Eng. Reg’l Council of Carpenters\n\nv. Kinton, 284 F.3d 9, 30 (1st Cir. 2002).       Where the attorneys’\n\nfees requested are unreasonably excessive, it is within a court’s\n\ndiscretion to deny fees entirely.      See Lewis v. Kendrick, 944 F.2d\n\n949, 958 (1st Cir. 1991); Brown v. Stackler, 612 F.2d 1057, 1059\n\n(7th Cir. 1980).1    The court’s order may be read to overstate the\n\ndegree to which Nationwide’s and Wausau’s papers in support of\n\ntheir emergency motions were duplicative.         Nevertheless, after\n\nreviewing the record, we conclude that the district court did not\n\nabuse its discretion by finding Nationwide’s fee request to be so\n\nexcessive as to merit outright denial of any fee.\n\n          Nationwide’s request sought approximately $60,000 of\n\ncompensation for the work its counsel performed on its emergency\n\nmotion in the district court.          The ultimate product of these\n\nefforts were two (opening and reply) memoranda totaling about 34\n\npages in length, and attendance and argument at a short hearing.\n\nRelated filings in the arbitration proceedings, local counsel fees,\n\nand expenses for travel to attend the hearing brought the total up\n\nto nearly $90,000.   Litigation may be expensive but this bill, for\n\na single narrow dispute about a prior order of the court, is\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Although they are not applicable here, there are some\nstatutes governing the award of attorneys’ fees that may provide\ndistrict courts with less discretion to deny fees. See, e.g., De\nJesus v. Banco Popular de P.R., 918 F.2d 232, 233-34 (1st Cir.\n1990) (Truth in Lending Act).\n\n                                 -3-\n\fexcessive by more than a small margin--or so the district court\n\ncould reasonably conclude.\n\n            Nor did the district court abuse its discretion, see\n\nDouglas v. York County, 360 F.3d 286, 290 (1st Cir. 2004), in\n\ndenying Nationwide’s motion for reconsideration even if we assume\n\ndubitante   that   the   somewhat   reduced   fee   request   was   not   a\n\nreasonable order.   A fee application may not be used as “an opening\n\ngambit in negotiations to reach an ultimate result.”          Lewis, 944\n\nF.2d at 958.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f",
