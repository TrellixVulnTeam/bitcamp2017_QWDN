Plaintiff-appellant,\n\nPeople    to     End     Homelessness,       Inc.    (\"PEH\"),    is   a   non-profit\n\norganization operating in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, which seeks to\n\nexpand and preserve the supply of affordable housing in Rhode\n\nIsland.    Defendants-appellees in this case are the Develcos (the\n\n\"Owners\"), a group of four separately-owned but commonly managed\n\nhousing developments located in Woonsocket, Rhode Island.                         The\n\nother defendants-appellees in this case are the United States\n\nDepartment      of     Housing    and     Urban    Development    (\"HUD\")   and   its\n\nSecretary.      PEH brought suit in federal district court challenging\n\nthe expiration of low-income housing contracts between HUD and the\n\nOwners.    The district court granted HUD's motion to dismiss and\n\nthen granted summary judgment for the Owners.                   For the reasons set\n\nforth below, we affirm both rulings.\n\nI.             BACKGROUND\n\n               This litigation revolves around the \"Section 8\" program\n\ncreated by HUD in 1974.             The program is governed largely by the\n\nUnited States Housing Act of 1937, § 8 as amended, 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1437f (2003) (\"the Housing Act\").                 We begin with a brief sketch of\n\nhow this program works.           The purpose of the program is to \"aid low-\n\nincome families in obtaining a decent place to live and [promote]\n\neconomically mixed housing.\"               Id. § 1437f(a).      Under the Section 8\n\nprogram,   HUD       enters      into    Housing    Assistance    Payment   (\"HAP\")\n\ncontracts with private property owners and determines the maximum\n\n\n                                            -3-\n\fmonthly rate that the owner may charge for each dwelling.              Under\n\nthe terms of the HAP contract, the property owner receives rent\n\ndirectly from two sources, the low-income tenant and HUD. The low-\n\nincome tenants    pay   the   property   owner   a   percentage   of   their\n\nadjusted income, typically about 30 percent.          The difference that\n\nremains between the HAP contract rent and the portion provided by\n\nthe tenant is paid to the owner by HUD in the form of an assistance\n\npayment or subsidy.\n\n          Owners are required to provide the Secretary of HUD and\n\nthe low-income tenants \"not less than one year\" written notice of\n\ntheir intention to terminate any Section 8 HAP contract.1              Id. §\n\n1437f(c)(8)(a).   If the owner does not provide the proper notice,\n\nthe owner may not evict the tenants or increase the tenants' rent\n\nuntil such time as the owner has provided the notice and the full\n\none year has expired. Id. § 1437f(c)(8)(B). In circumstances when\n\nthe HAP contracts expire, the Secretary and the owner may agree to\n\nrenew the contract.\n\n          Should the owner choose not to renew, the Housing Act\n\ndictates that HUD \"will provide tenant-based rental assistance to\n\nall eligible residents, enabling them to choose the place they wish\n\nto rent, which is likely to include the dwelling unit in which they\n\n\n     1\n       The statute defines termination of a HAP contract as, \"the\nexpiration of the assistance contract or an owner's refusal to\nrenew the assistance contract, and such term shall include\ntermination of the contract for business reasons.\"         Id. §\n1437f(c)(8)(D).\n\n                                   -4-\n\fcurrently reside.\"          Id. § 1437f(c)(8)(A).       If tenants choose to\n\nstay in the unit in which they currently reside, HUD issues those\n\ntenants \"enhanced vouchers.\"           These vouchers cover the cost of any\n\nincrease in rent that the owner of the dwelling may charge once the\n\nHAP contract expires, while keeping the tenants' portion of the\n\nrent stable at the pre-expiration rate.\n\n                 Having described the basic mechanics of the Section 8\n\nprogram, we now turn to the events that prompted this appeal.                The\n\nOwners began providing affordable housing to low-income families\n\npursuant to Section 8 HAP contracts in the mid-1970's.              Since that\n\ntime,      the    Owners   and   HUD   entered   into   numerous   renewal   HAP\n\ncontracts.        The most recent HAP contracts were set to expire on May\n\n31, 2001.         Six weeks before the scheduled expiration date, the\n\nOwners sent the tenants a notice informing them that the HAP\n\ncontracts would not be renewed.                HUD, in coordination with the\n\nWoonsocket Housing Authority (\"WHA\"), subsequently issued enhanced\n\nvouchers to each eligible tenant.2\n\n                 On May 30, 2001, the day before the HAP contracts were\n\nset to expire, PEH filed a complaint, a motion for a temporary\n\nrestraining order and a motion for a preliminary injunction in the\n\ndistrict court against the Owners, HUD and its Secretary, and the\n\nWHA.       PEH raised two major issues in the complaint.            First, PEH\n\n\n       2\n        The WHA is a public housing authority created under state\nlaw which operates and administers various low-income housing\nprograms in the City of Woonsocket.\n\n                                         -5-\n\fargued that the six weeks notice given to the tenants by the Owners\n\nfailed to comply with the one year federal notice requirement.\n\nSecond, PEH argued that HUD was acting in violation of federal law\n\nby approving the Owners' decision not to renew the expiring HAP\n\ncontracts and by issuing enhanced vouchers to the tenants.\n\n            On June 22, 2001, PEH moved to add the Develco Tenant\n\nAssociation (DTA), a group of Develco tenants, as a co-plaintiff\n\nwith PEH.   There were no objections to the motion and the complaint\n\nwas amended to add DTA as a co-plaintiff.        Shortly thereafter, the\n\nOwners   agreed   to    a   voluntary   restraining   order.   The   order\n\nprohibited the Owners from evicting or raising the rent on any\n\ntenant for one year, provided that the tenant was a participant in\n\nthe Section 8 program.\n\n            After the restraining order was issued, HUD moved to\n\ndismiss for failure to state a claim.          The district court, in a\n\nmemorandum opinion dated March 29, 2002, granted the motion.           The\n\ndistrict court ruled that federal law did not obligate or even\n\nauthorize HUD to \"unilaterally extend HAP contracts against the\n\nwill of owners.\"       Similarly, the district court stated that there\n\nwas no statutory authorization which would require the Owners to\n\ncontinue participating in HAP contracts once they expired.             The\n\ndistrict court stated that the \"sole remedy for failing to provide\n\nthe requisite notice is that the owner is prohibited from evicting\n\n\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\ftenants or increasing their rent payments until such notice has\n\nbeen provided and the prescribed notice period has elapsed.\"\n\n            With HUD dismissed from the case, the Owners and WHA\n\nmoved for summary judgment.   In a second memorandum opinion, dated\n\nOctober 16, 2002, the district court held that PEH and DTA lacked\n\nstanding to pursue their complaint and granted the motion.       The\n\ndistrict court rejected PEH's request to require the Owners to\n\ncontinue renting units under the Section 8 HAP contracts.        The\n\ncourt found that HUD's decision not to renew the expiring HAP\n\ncontracts was a permissible exercise of HUD's discretion, and that\n\nsince the contracts had expired, it was not possible to grant the\n\nrelief requested.    PEH filed this timely appeal challenging the\n\ndistrict court's decision to dismiss PEH's claims against HUD and\n\ngrant the Owners' motion for summary judgment.3    The DTA no longer\n\nexists and therefore has not joined in this appeal.        No other\n\nDevelco tenant joined PEH in this case at any time.\n\nII.         DISCUSSION\n\n            We address first PEH's challenge to the district court's\n\ndecision to dismiss HUD from this lawsuit for failure to state a\n\nclaim.    See Fed. R. Evid. 12(b)(6).   We review a district court's\n\nallowance of a motion to dismiss de novo.     See Martin v. Applied\n\nCellular Tech., Inc., 284 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2002).    In doing so,\n\n\n      3\n        PEH does not appeal the district court's grant of summary\njudgment in favor of the WHA and the WHA is not involved in this\nappeal.\n\n                                 -7-\n\f\"[w]e accept as true the well-pleaded factual allegations of the\n\ncomplaint,    draw   all   reasonable      inferences   therefrom    in   the\n\nplaintiff's favor and determine whether the complaint, so read,\n\nsets forth facts sufficient to justify recovery on any cognizable\n\ntheory.\"     Id. at 6.\n\n            PEH's complaint alleged that HUD violated a variety of\n\nfederal    laws,   including   the   Housing    Act,    the   Administrative\n\nProcedures Act, 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq. (2003), the Fair Housing\n\nAct, 42 U.S.C. § 3608(e)(5) (1994), and the Fifth and Fourteenth\n\nAmendments to the Constitution.       Fairly read, the essence of these\n\nclaims is that HUD illegally permitted the HAP contracts to expire.\n\nPEH alleges that HUD should have required the Owners to remain in\n\nthe Section 8 program under HAP contracts until the one year notice\n\nperiod ended pursuant to the voluntary restraining order agreed to\n\nby the Owners.\n\n             This argument, however, is forestalled by the clear\n\nlanguage of the Housing Act.         See 42 U.S.C. § 1437f.       When \"the\n\nlanguage of a statute 'is plain and admits of no more than one\n\nmeaning . . . the sole function of the courts is to enforce the\n\nstatute according to its terms.'\"          Arnold v. United Parcel Serv.,\n\nInc., 136 F.3d 854, 858 (1st Cir. 1998) (quoting Caminetti v.\n\nUnited States, 242 U.S. 470, 485 (1917)). Section (c)(8)(B) of the\n\nHousing Act states in relevant part:\n\n             In the event the owner does not provide the\n             notice required, the owner may not evict the\n\n                                     -8-\n\f            tenants or increase the tenants' rent payment\n            until such time as the owner has provided the\n            notice and 1 year has elapsed. The Secretary\n            may allow the owner to renew the terminating\n            contract for a period of time sufficient to\n            give tenants 1 year of advance notice under\n            such terms and conditions as the Secretary may\n            require.\n\n\n(emphasis added).     Congress' statement that the Secretary \"may\n\nallow\" the owner to renew the HAP contracts makes it apparent that\n\nHUD was not required to renew the Section 8 HAP contracts, even in\n\nthe face of a notice violation.\n\n            PEH also argues that HUD should not have issued enhanced\n\nvouchers to the tenants once the Owners had provided inadequate\n\nnotice.     According to PEH, enhanced vouchers can only be issued\n\nwhen an owner provides proper notice and the one year notice period\n\nhas expired. This argument is also contrary to the clear statutory\n\nlanguage adopted by Congress.\n\n            We begin by noting that the Housing Act does not directly\n\nsupport PEH's argument.    Section (c)(8)(B) of the statute, which\n\nwas quoted above and describes how the Section 8 program works when\n\nan owner fails to give proper notice, does not mention enhanced\n\nvouchers, let alone prohibit their use.    Rather, enhanced vouchers\n\nare covered under a different section of the statute.        See id. §\n\n1437f(t).     This section states, in pertinent part, that \"the\n\ntermination or expiration of the contract for rental assistance .\n\n. . results in tenants . . . being eligible for enhanced voucher\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fassistance under this subsection.\"        Id. § 1437f(t)(2).          There are,\n\nof course, exceptions.       These include instances when a tenant\n\nleaves the covered project or when the voucher is used by someone\n\nother than the family who was originally issued the voucher.                    See\n\nid. § 1437f(t)(1)(C).     But Congress did not include in this list of\n\nexceptions an owner's failure to give proper notice.                   That fact\n\ncertainly does not help PEH's argument.        See Com. of Mass. by Dept.\n\nof Public Welfare v. Yeutter, 947 F.2d 537, 542 (1st Cir. 1991)\n\n(finding it    relevant   that    \"[n]owhere      in    this   section    do   the\n\ndrafters suggest that the Secretary may not request information and\n\nmaterials beyond those specified as forbidden fruit\"). But it also\n\ndoes not end the matter.     See Stoutt v. Banco Popular de P.R., 320\n\nF.3d 26, 30 (1st Cir. 2003) (stating that omissions in statutory\n\nlanguage are not necessarily conclusive because \"[c]ourts have\n\noften added to statutes unexpressed conditions or qualifications\n\nconsonant with statutory purpose or other public concerns\").\n\n          More important is that the section of the Housing Act\n\ndescribing    enhanced    vouchers,    see   42    U.S.C.      §    1437f(t)(2),\n\nexplicitly defines when a tenant may be eligible for enhanced\n\nvouchers. This section references the Multifamily Assisted Housing\n\nReform and Affordability Act of 1997, Pub. L. No. 105-65, 111 Stat.\n\n1344 (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 1437f) (\"MAHRA\").                    The MAHRA, in\n\nturn,   provides   that    when    a   Section         8   contract      is    \"not\n\nrenewed . . . the Secretary shall make enhanced voucher assistance\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\f. . . available on behalf of each low-income family who, upon the\n\ndate of such expiration, is residing in an assisted dwelling unit\n\nin the covered project.\"         Id. § 524(d)(1) (emphasis added).          This\n\nprovision applies to a \"contract [that] will (under its own terms)\n\nexpire during the period consisting of fiscal years 2000 through\n\n2004.\"    Id. § 524(d)(2)(A)(VII).         That is precisely the situation\n\nwe face in this case.        The HAP contracts between the Owners and HUD\n\nexpired on May 31, 2001.        Upon expiration of the HAP contracts, the\n\nMAHRA requires HUD to issue the enhanced vouchers if a tenant\n\nchooses to remain in the same unit.            HUD did so.    In light of this\n\nclear    statutory     language,   we     simply   cannot    agree   with   PEH's\n\nargument that HUD acted improperly when it issued enhanced vouchers\n\nto the tenants in this case.         See Riva v. Comm. of Mass., 61 F.3d\n\n1003,     1007 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"In statutory construction case,\n\nbeginning point must be language of statute, and when statute\n\nspeaks with clarity to an issue, judicial inquiry into statute's\n\nmeaning,    in   all   but   the   most    extraordinary     circumstance,    is\n\nfinished.\" (quoting Estate of Cowart v. Nicklos Drilling Co., 505\n\nU.S. 469, 475 (1992))).\n\n            PEH challenges this clear statutory language by drawing\n\nour attention to a document that it considers \"new pertinent and\n\nsignificant legal authority.\" The document is related to testimony\n\nthat HUD provided at a Senate Subcommittee hearing on affordable\n\nhousing preservation on October 9, 2002.             Following the hearing,\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fthe subcommittee issued a series of follow-up questions to HUD,\n\nsome of which dealt with HUD's handling of the Section 8 program.\n\nPEH cites to the written responses that HUD provided to the\n\nquestions.\n\n            PEH presents this document to us as a supplemental\n\nletter, as authorized by Fed. R. App. P. 28(j).          HUD argues that we\n\nshould not consider PEH's document because supplemental authority\n\nas defined by Rule 28(j) is generally understood to refer to new\n\ncase law, which PEH's document is certainly not.               We decline to\n\ndefine the contours of the rule, and choose instead to assume\n\nwithout deciding that it is permissible for us to consider PEH's\n\ndocument.\n\n             That said, we are not persuaded that the document helps\n\nadvance PEH's argument in any meaningful way.              This is because\n\nHUD's answers are inconsistent with PEH's position. HUD's answers,\n\nit seems to us, conform to our reading of the relevant statutes.\n\nFor example, HUD states that it \"does not have the legal authority\n\nto   compel    an   unwilling   owner   to    execute    new   project-based\n\nassistance contracts or to unilaterally prevent the contract from\n\nexpiring.\"     HUD goes on to explain that \"[i]n cases where improper\n\nnotice   has    been   provided,   eligible   families    residing   in   the\n\nproperty will still be issued enhanced vouchers when the contract\n\nexpires.\"      Perhaps most important of all is HUD's statement that\n\n\"even if the notices given by the owners were not adequate, HUD\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fwould still have been compelled by Section 524(d)(1) of MAHRA to\n\nissue enhanced vouchers to all eligible residents . . . on the date\n\nin which the project-based Section 8 contract expired.\"\n\n          PEH does not discuss or explain these statements by HUD.\n\nInstead, PEH calls our attention to one section of a single\n\nparagraph of the document which states, in relevant part, \"the\n\nowner will not receive any voucher assistance payments until proper\n\nnotice has been provided to the tenants.\"   Read in isolation, this\n\nstatement would support PEH's argument.   Read in context, however,\n\nit does not.     This is because it does not appear that the above\n\nstatement was the policy of HUD at the time of the events in\n\nquestion here.     Rather, it seems to us that the statement is a\n\nprediction of a future policy that HUD may adopt.     We take this\n\nview because as part of its answer HUD indicated that it was\n\nrevising its current policies.     Up to the present time, however,\n\nHUD stated that it did not withhold enhanced vouchers as a tool to\n\nforce compliance with the   Housing Act's notice requirement.   This\n\nreading of the answer is consistent with the many other statements\n\nmade by HUD throughout the document, as well as this litigation, in\n\nwhich it claimed that enhanced vouchers have not been denied to\n\ntenants when an owner gave improper notice.\n\n          Whether the document is referring to HUD's policy in the\n\nfuture, or HUD's policy at the time the document was written is of\n\nlittle consequence.   The important point is that the document does\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fnot show that HUD's policies, as they existed at the time relevant\n\nto this case, prohibited the issuance of enhanced vouchers when an\n\nowner gave improper notice.            Simply put, we do not find the new\n\nauthority offered by PEH to be persuasive or relevant.\n\n            PEH     also    argues   that   a    guidebook   published      by   HUD\n\nregarding its Section 8 renewal policies demonstrates that HUD is\n\nprohibited from issuing enhanced vouchers when improper notice is\n\ngiven.    The guidebook is dated January, 2001, and therefore was\n\npresumably in effect at the times relevant to this appeal.                       PEH\n\nfocuses on the guidebook's statement that \"[i]f proper notification\n\nwas not provided . . . HUD/CA will offer the owner a short-term\n\ncontract.\"        The guidebook, however, does not say that HUD is\n\nprohibited from issuing enhanced vouchers.                Even if it did, HUD\n\ncould    not   use    its    own     guidebook    to    contravene    the    clear\n\nCongressional commands, described above, that are contained in the\n\nHousing Act and the MAHRA.            See Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural\n\nRes. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 843 n.9 (1984) (\"The\n\njudiciary      is    the    final    authority     on   issues   of    statutory\n\nconstruction and must reject administrative constructions which are\n\ncontrary to clear congressional intent.\").\n\n            In sum, we are unable to find any statutory support for\n\nPEH's argument that HUD was required to extend the HAP contracts\n\nonce they expired and that HUD acted improperly in issuing the\n\n\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fenhanced vouchers to the tenants. The district court's decision to\n\ngrant HUD's motion to dismiss is affirmed.\n\n             We now turn to the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment in favor of the Owners on the ground that PEH lacked\n\nstanding to pursue its lawsuit once the voluntary restraining order\n\nhad been issued and HUD had been dismissed from the case.          Before\n\ndelving into the law, we stop to note that PEH is the only\n\nappellant.      The DTA has not joined in this appeal, although they\n\nwere plaintiffs below.\n\n           We also briefly pause to address an argument made by the\n\nOwners that PEH waived its arguments as to standing because it\n\nfailed to address the issue in its opening brief.             It is well\n\nsettled in this circuit that issues \"adverted to on an appeal in a\n\nperfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some developed argumentation,\n\nare deemed to have been abandoned.\"        Ryan v. Royal Ins. Co. of Am.,\n\n916 F.2d 731, 734 (1st Cir.         1990).    After carefully reviewing\n\nPEH's appellate brief, however, we find that PEH sufficiently\n\nbriefed   the    standing   issue   to   warrant   consideration   of   its\n\narguments.      We therefore proceed to the merits.\n\n             We review a district court's grant of summary judgment de\n\nnovo.   See Cotter v. City of Boston, 323 F.3d 160, 166 (2003).         In\n\ndoing so, we draw all reasonable facts in the light most favorable\n\nto the appellants.     See Macone v. Town of Wakefield, 277 F.3d 1, 5\n\n\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\f(1st Cir. 2002).      We affirm a grant of summary judgment \"only if no\n\ngenuine dispute of material fact exists.\"          Id.\n\n           Under Article III, § 2 of the Constitution, a party must\n\nhave standing to maintain a suit in federal court.            See Clinton v.\n\nCity of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 429 (1998).             Article III standing\n\n\"imposes three fairly strict requirements.\"                Munoz-Mendoza v.\n\nPierce, 711 F.2d 421, 424 (1st Cir. 1983).              The third and final\n\nrequirement,    which    is   our   primary   concern    in   this   case,   is\n\nredressability. See Vt. Agency of Natural Res. v. United States Ex\n\nRel. Stevens, 529 U.S. 765, 771 (2000).             This means that the\n\nplaintiff must show \"a substantial likelihood that the requested\n\nrelief will remedy the alleged injury in fact.\"            Id. (citation and\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n           The party invoking federal jurisdiction, in this case\n\nPEH, bears the burden of proving the elements of standing.                   See\n\nFW/PBS, Inc. v. City of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215, 231 (1990).                    The\n\nSupreme Court has explained that the level of proof required\n\ndepends on the stage of the proceedings.          See     Lujan v. Defenders\n\nof Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992).          As litigation progresses,\n\nArticle III places an increasingly demanding evidentiary burden on\n\nparties that seek to invoke federal jurisdiction.             A plaintiff who\n\nhas standing at the motion to dismiss stage, does not automatically\n\nhave standing at the summary judgment or trial stage.            See Lewis v.\n\nCasey,   518   U.S.   343,    358   (1996).    Instead,    standing    is    \"an\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\findispensable part of the plaintiff's case, each element must be\n\nsupported . . . with the manner and degree of evidence required at\n\nthe successive stages of the litigation.\"     Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.\n\n            This case proceeded beyond the motion to dismiss stage\n\nand ended at the summary judgment stage.      By the time it reached\n\nthe summary judgment stage, the district court had already issued\n\na restraining order prohibiting the Owners from evicting the\n\ntenants or raising their rent for one year.    The district court had\n\nalso dismissed HUD from the litigation.     Therefore, the question\n\nbefore us is whether PEH continued to have standing after these two\n\nimportant events. More specifically, we are concerned with whether\n\nthe relief PEH requested from the district court would remedy its\n\nalleged injuries.\n\n            To make this determination it is important to define with\n\nprecision PEH's alleged injuries.       In its appellate brief, PEH\n\nstates that the actions of the Owners caused it to suffer three\n\ninjuries.    PEH claims that:   (1) it was denied an opportunity to\n\nseek preservation alternatives to the contract termination; (2) it\n\nwas prevented from providing effective educational assistance to\n\ntenants; and (3) the adverse effects on the affordable housing\n\nmarket would threaten PEH's ability to locate low cost housing for\n\nits members and clients.\n\n            PEH alleges that the injuries it suffered could be\n\nredressed in two ways.    First, by the district court setting aside\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\fthe issuance of the enhanced vouchers.        Second, by the district\n\ncourt using its equitable powers to order the Owners to extend the\n\nHAP contracts.    We do not agree.\n\n          The district court's restraining order redressed PEH's\n\nalleged injuries.     By granting a one year notice period, the\n\ndistrict court gave PEH time to \"seek preservation alternatives,\"\n\ntime to convince the owners to change their minds about renewing\n\nthe HAP contracts, and time to provide \"effective educational\n\nassistance   to   tenants.\"   There    is   simply   no   evidence   that\n\nprohibiting HUD from issuing enhanced vouchers would have redressed\n\nPEH's alleged injuries. As for the \"adverse effects on the housing\n\nmarket,\" this injury is not related to or caused by the Owners'\n\nfailure to supply the required notice.       Put another way, even if\n\nthe Owners had provided adequate notice from the very start, they\n\ncould still have chosen not to renew the HAP contracts with HUD.\n\nAs we have already explained, the applicable statutes simply do not\n\nrequire the Owners or HUD to renew the HAP contracts once they\n\nexpire. For these reasons, we hold that PEH does not have standing\n\nto pursue its lawsuit because its alleged injuries, to the extent\n\nthey can be redressed, have already been remedied by the district\n\ncourt.\n\n\n\n\n                                -18-\n\fIII.        CONCLUSION\n\n            The district court's decisions to grant HUD's motion to\n\ndismiss and grant the Owners' motion for summary judgment are\n\nAFFIRMED.   So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                -19-\n\f",

(\"PEH\"), is a non-profit organization operating in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, which seeks to expand and preserve the supply of affordable housing in Rhode Island. Defendants-appellees in this case are the Develcos (the \"Owners\"), a group of four separately-owned but commonly managed housing developments located in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. The other defendants-appellees in this case are the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\") and its Secretary. PEH brought suit in federal district court challenging the expiration of low-income housing contracts between HUD and the Owners. The district court granted HUD's motion to dismiss and then granted summary judgment for the Owners. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm both rulings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This litigation revolves around the \"Section 8\" program created by HUD in 1974. The program is governed largely by the United States Housing Act of 1937, &#167; 8 as amended, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1437f (2003) (\"the Housing Act\"). We begin with a brief sketch of how this program works. The purpose of the program is to \"aid low-income families in obtaining a decent place to live and [promote] economically mixed housing.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1437f(a). Under the Section 8 program, HUD enters into Housing Assistance Payment (\"HAP\") contracts with private property owners and determines the maximum monthly rate that the owner may charge for each dwelling. Under the terms of the HAP contract, the property owner receives rent directly from two sources, the low-income tenant and HUD. The low-income tenants pay the property owner a percentage of their adjusted income, typically about 30 percent. The difference that remains between the HAP contract rent and the portion provided by the tenant is paid to the owner by HUD in the form of an assistance payment or subsidy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Owners are required to provide the Secretary of HUD and the low-income tenants \"not less than one year\" written notice of their intention to terminate any Section 8 HAP contract.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1437f(c)(8)(A). If the owner does not provide the proper notice, the owner may not evict the tenants or increase the tenants' rent until such time as the owner has provided the notice and the full one year has expired. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1437f(c)(8)(B). In circumstances when the HAP contracts expire, the Secretary and the owner may agree to renew the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Should the owner choose not to renew, the Housing Act dictates that HUD \"will provide tenant-based rental assistance to all eligible residents, enabling them to choose the place they wish to rent, which is likely to include the dwelling unit in which they currently reside.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1437f(c)(8)(A). If tenants choose to stay in the unit in which they currently reside, HUD issues those tenants \"enhanced vouchers.\" These vouchers cover the cost of any increase in rent that the owner of the dwelling may charge once the HAP contract expires, while keeping the tenants' portion of the rent stable at the pre-expiration rate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having described the basic mechanics of the Section 8 program, we now turn to the events that prompted this appeal. The Owners began providing affordable housing to low-income families pursuant to Section 8 HAP contracts in the mid-1970's. Since that time, the Owners and HUD entered into numerous renewal HAP contracts. The most recent HAP contracts were set to expire on May 31, 2001. Six weeks before the scheduled expiration date, the Owners sent the tenants a notice informing them that the HAP contracts would not be renewed. HUD, in coordination with the Woonsocket Housing Authority (\"WHA\"), subsequently issued enhanced vouchers to each eligible tenant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 30, 2001, the day before the HAP contracts were set to expire, PEH filed a complaint, a motion for a temporary restraining order and a motion for a preliminary injunction in the district court against the Owners, HUD and its Secretary, and the WHA. PEH raised two major issues in the complaint. First, PEH argued that the six weeks notice given to the tenants by the Owners failed to comply with the one year federal notice requirement. Second, PEH argued that HUD was acting in violation of federal law by approving the Owners' decision not to renew the expiring HAP contracts and by issuing enhanced vouchers to the tenants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 22, 2001, PEH moved to add the Develco Tenant Association (DTA), a group of Develco tenants, as a co-plaintiff with PEH. There were no objections to the motion and the complaint was amended to add DTA as a co-plaintiff. Shortly thereafter, the Owners agreed to a voluntary restraining order. The order prohibited the Owners from evicting or raising the rent on any tenant for one year, provided that the tenant was a participant in the Section 8 program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the restraining order was issued, HUD moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The district court, in a memorandum opinion dated March 29, 2002, granted the motion. The district court ruled that federal law did not obligate or even authorize HUD to \"unilaterally extend HAP contracts against the will of owners.\" Similarly, the district court stated that there was no statutory authorization which would require the Owners to continue participating in HAP contracts once they expired. The district court stated that the \"sole remedy for failing to provide the requisite notice is that the owner is prohibited from evicting tenants or increasing their rent payments until such notice has been provided and the prescribed notice period has elapsed.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With HUD dismissed from the case, the Owners and WHA moved for summary judgment. In a second memorandum opinion, dated October 16, 2002, the district court held that PEH and DTA lacked standing to pursue their complaint and granted the motion. The district court rejected PEH's request to require the Owners to continue renting units under the Section 8 HAP contracts. The court found that HUD's decision not to renew the expiring HAP contracts was a permissible exercise of HUD's discretion, and that since the contracts had expired, it was not possible to grant the relief requested. PEH filed this timely appeal challenging the district court's decision to dismiss PEH's claims against HUD and grant the Owners' motion for summary judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The DTA no longer exists and therefore has not joined in this appeal. No other Develco tenant joined PEH in this case at any time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We address first PEH's challenge to the district court's decision to dismiss HUD from this lawsuit for failure to state a claim. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). We review a district court's allowance of a motion to dismiss de novo. <i>See Martin v. Applied Cellular Tech., Inc.,</i> 284 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2002). In doing so, \"[w]e accept as true the well-pleaded factual allegations of the complaint, draw all reasonable inferences therefrom in the plaintiff's favor and determine whether the complaint, so read, sets forth facts sufficient to justify recovery on any cognizable theory.\" <i>Id.</i> at 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PEH's complaint alleged that HUD violated a variety of federal laws, including the Housing Act, the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. &#167; 701 et seq. (2003), the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 3608(e)(5) (1994), and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution. Fairly read, the essence of these claims is that HUD illegally permitted the HAP contracts to expire. PEH alleges that HUD should have required the Owners to remain in the Section 8 program under HAP contracts until the one year notice period ended pursuant to the voluntary restraining order agreed to by the Owners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument, however, is forestalled by the clear language of the Housing Act. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1437f. When \"the language of a statute `is plain and admits of no more than one meaning ... the sole function of the courts is to enforce the statute according to its terms.'\" <i>Arnold v. United Parcel Serv., Inc.,</i> 136 F.3d 854, 858 (1st Cir.1998) (quoting <i>Caminetti v. United States,</i> 242 U.S. 470, 485, 37 S.Ct. 192, 61 L.Ed. 442 (1917)). Section (c)(8)(B) of the Housing Act states in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the event the owner does not provide the notice required, the owner may not evict the tenants or increase the tenants' rent payment until such time as the owner has provided the notice and 1 year has elapsed. The Secretary <i>may</i> allow the owner to renew the terminating contract for a period of time sufficient to give tenants 1 year of advance notice under such terms and conditions as the Secretary may require.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added). Congress' statement that the Secretary \"may allow\" the owner to renew the HAP contracts makes it apparent that HUD was not required to renew the Section 8 HAP contracts, even in the face of a notice violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PEH also argues that HUD should not have issued enhanced vouchers to the tenants once the Owners had provided inadequate notice. According to PEH, enhanced vouchers can only be issued when an owner provides proper notice and the one year notice period has expired. This argument is also contrary to the clear statutory language adopted by Congress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by noting that the Housing Act does not directly support PEH's argument. Section (c)(8)(B) of the statute, which was quoted above and describes how the Section 8 program works when an owner fails to give proper notice, does not mention enhanced vouchers, let alone prohibit their use. Rather, enhanced vouchers are covered under a different section of the statute. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1437f(t). This section states, in pertinent part, that \"the termination or expiration of the contract for rental assistance ... results in tenants... being eligible for enhanced voucher assistance under this subsection.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1437f(t)(2). There are, of course, exceptions. These include instances when a tenant leaves the covered project or when the voucher is used by someone other than the family who was originally issued the voucher. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1437f(t)(1)(C). But Congress did not include in this list of exceptions an owner's failure to give proper notice. That fact certainly does not help PEH's argument. <i>See Com. of Mass. by Dept. of Public Welfare v. Yeutter,</i> 947 F.2d 537, 542 (1st Cir.1991) (finding it relevant that \"[n]owhere in this section do the drafters suggest that the Secretary may not request information and materials beyond those specified as forbidden fruit\"). But it also does not end the matter. <i>See Stoutt v. Banco Popular de P.R.,</i> 320 F.3d 26, 30 (1st Cir.2003) (stating that omissions in statutory language are not necessarily conclusive because \"[c]ourts have often added to statutes unexpressed conditions or qualifications consonant with statutory purpose or other public concerns\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More important is that the section of the Housing Act describing enhanced vouchers, <i>see</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1437f(t)(2), explicitly defines when a tenant may be eligible for enhanced vouchers. This section references the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997, Pub.L. No. 105-65, 111 Stat. 1344 (codified at 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1437f) (\"MAHRA\"). The MAHRA, in turn, provides that when a Section 8 contract is \"not renewed ... the Secretary <i>shall make enhanced voucher assistance ... available</i> on behalf of each low-income family who, upon the date of such expiration, is residing in an assisted dwelling unit in the covered project.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 524(d)(1) (emphasis added). This provision applies to a \"contract [that] will (under its own terms) expire during the period consisting of fiscal years 2000 through 2004.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 524(d)(2)(A)(VII). That is precisely the situation we face in this case. The HAP contracts between the Owners and HUD expired on May 31, 2001. Upon expiration of the HAP contracts, the MAHRA requires HUD to issue the enhanced vouchers if a tenant chooses to remain in the same unit. HUD did so. In light of this clear statutory language, we simply cannot agree with PEH's argument that HUD acted improperly when it issued enhanced vouchers to the tenants in this case. <i>See Riva v. Comm. of Mass.,</i> 61 F.3d 1003, 1007 (1st Cir.1995) (\"In statutory construction case, beginning point must be language of statute, and when statute speaks with clarity to an issue, judicial inquiry into statute's meaning, in all but the most extraordinary circumstance, is finished.\" (quoting <i>Estate of Cowart v. Nicklos Drilling Co.,</i> 505 U.S. 469, 475, 112 S.Ct. 2589, 120 L.Ed.2d 379 (1992))).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PEH challenges this clear statutory language by drawing our attention to a document that it considers \"new pertinent and significant legal authority.\" The document is related to testimony that HUD provided at a Senate Subcommittee hearing on affordable housing preservation on October 9, 2002. Following the hearing, the subcommittee issued a series of follow-up questions to HUD, some of which dealt with HUD's handling of the Section 8 program. PEH cites to the written responses that HUD provided to the questions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PEH presents this document to us as a supplemental letter, as authorized by Fed. R.App. P. 28(j). HUD argues that we should not consider PEH's document because supplemental authority as defined by Rule 28(j) is generally understood to refer to new case law, which PEH's document is certainly not. We decline to define the contours of the rule, and choose instead to assume without deciding that it is permissible for us to consider PEH's document.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That said, we are not persuaded that the document helps advance PEH's argument in any meaningful way. This is because HUD's answers are inconsistent with PEH's position. HUD's answers, it seems to us, conform to our reading of the relevant statutes. For example, HUD states that it \"does not have the legal authority to compel an unwilling owner to execute new project-based assistance contracts or to unilaterally prevent the contract from expiring.\" HUD goes on to explain that \"[i]n cases where improper notice has been provided, eligible families residing in the property will still be issued enhanced vouchers when the contract expires.\" Perhaps most important of all is HUD's statement that \"even if the notices given by the owners were not adequate, HUD would still have been compelled by Section 524(d)(1) of MAHRA to issue enhanced vouchers to all eligible residents ... on the date in which the project-based Section 8 contract expired.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PEH does not discuss or explain these statements by HUD. Instead, PEH calls our attention to one section of a single paragraph of the document which states, in relevant part, \"the owner will not receive any voucher assistance payments until proper notice has been provided to the tenants.\" Read in isolation, this statement would support PEH's argument. Read in context, however, it does not. This is because it does not appear that the above statement was the policy of HUD at the time of the events in question here. Rather, it seems to us that the statement is a prediction of a future policy that HUD may adopt. We take this view because as part of its answer HUD indicated that it was revising its current policies. Up to the present time, however, HUD stated that it did not withhold enhanced vouchers as a tool to force compliance with the Housing Act's notice requirement. This reading of the answer is consistent with the many other statements made by HUD throughout the document, as well as this litigation, in which it claimed that enhanced vouchers have not been denied to tenants when an owner gave improper notice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether the document is referring to HUD's policy in the future, or HUD's policy at the time the document was written is of little consequence. The important point is that the document does not show that HUD's policies, <i>as they existed at the time relevant to this case,</i> prohibited the issuance of enhanced vouchers when an owner gave improper notice. Simply put, we do not find the new authority offered by PEH to be persuasive or relevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PEH also argues that a guidebook published by HUD regarding its Section 8 renewal policies demonstrates that HUD is prohibited from issuing enhanced vouchers when improper notice is given. The guidebook is dated January, 2001, and therefore was presumably in effect at the times relevant to this appeal. PEH focuses on the guidebook's statement that \"[i]f proper notification was not provided ... HUD/CA will offer the owner a short-term contract.\" The guidebook, however, does not say that HUD is prohibited from issuing enhanced vouchers. Even if it did, HUD could not use its own guidebook to contravene the clear Congressional commands, described above, that are contained in the Housing Act and the MAHRA. <i>See Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc.,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 843 n. 9, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984) (\"The judiciary is the final authority on issues of statutory construction and must reject administrative constructions which are contrary to clear congressional intent.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we are unable to find any statutory support for PEH's argument that HUD was required to extend the HAP contracts once they expired and that HUD acted improperly in issuing the enhanced vouchers to the tenants. The district court's decision to grant HUD's motion to dismiss is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now turn to the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the Owners on the ground that PEH lacked standing to pursue its lawsuit once the voluntary restraining order had been issued and HUD had been dismissed from the case. Before delving into the law, we stop to note that PEH is the only appellant. The DTA has not joined in this appeal, although they were plaintiffs below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also briefly pause to address an argument made by the Owners that PEH waived its arguments as to standing because it failed to address the issue in its opening brief. It is well settled in this circuit that issues \"adverted to on an appeal in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some developed argumentation, are deemed to have been abandoned.\" <i>Ryan v. Royal Ins. Co. of Am.,</i> 916 F.2d 731, 734 (1st Cir.1990). After carefully reviewing PEH's appellate brief, however, we find that PEH sufficiently briefed the standing issue to warrant consideration of its arguments. We therefore proceed to the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a district court's grant of summary judgment de novo. <i>See Cotter v. City of Boston,</i> 323 F.3d 160, 166 (2003). In doing so, we draw all reasonable facts in the light most favorable to the appellants. <i>See Macone v. Town of Wakefield,</i> 277 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2002). We affirm a grant of summary judgment \"only if no genuine dispute of material fact exists.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Article III, &#167; 2 of the Constitution, a party must have standing to maintain a suit in federal court. <i>See Clinton v. City of New York,</i> 524 U.S. 417, 429, 118 S.Ct. 2091, 141 L.Ed.2d 393 (1998). Article III standing \"imposes three fairly strict requirements.\" <i>Munoz-Mendoza v. Pierce,</i> 711 F.2d 421, 424 (1st Cir.1983). The third and final requirement, which is our primary concern in this case, is redressability. <i>See Vt. Agency of Natural Res. v. United States Ex Rel. Stevens,</i> 529 U.S. 765, 771, 120 S.Ct. 1858, 146 L.Ed.2d 836 (2000). This means that the plaintiff must show \"a substantial likelihood that the requested relief will remedy the alleged injury in fact.\" <i>Id.</i> (citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The party invoking federal jurisdiction, in this case PEH, bears the burden of proving the elements of standing. <i>See FW/PBS, Inc. v. City of Dallas,</i> 493 U.S. 215, 231, 110 S.Ct. 596, 107 L.Ed.2d 603 (1990). The Supreme Court has explained that the level of proof required depends on the stage of the proceedings. <i>See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 504 U.S. 555, 561, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). As litigation progresses, Article III places an increasingly demanding evidentiary burden on parties that seek to invoke federal jurisdiction. A plaintiff who has standing at the motion to dismiss stage, does not automatically have standing at the summary judgment or trial stage. <i>See Lewis v. Casey,</i> 518 U.S. 343, 358, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996). Instead, standing is \"an indispensable part of the plaintiff's case, each element must be supported ... with the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.\" <i>Lujan,</i> 504 U.S. at 561, 112 S.Ct. 2130.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case proceeded beyond the motion to dismiss stage and ended at the summary judgment stage. By the time it reached the summary judgment stage, the district court had already issued a restraining order prohibiting the Owners from evicting the tenants or raising their rent for one year. The district court had also dismissed HUD from the litigation. Therefore, the question before us is whether PEH continued to have standing after these two important events. More specifically, we are concerned with whether the relief PEH requested from the district court would remedy its alleged injuries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To make this determination it is important to define with precision PEH's alleged injuries. In its appellate brief, PEH states that the actions of the Owners caused it to suffer three injuries. PEH claims that: (1) it was denied an opportunity to seek preservation alternatives to the contract termination; (2) it was prevented from providing effective educational assistance to tenants; and (3) the adverse effects on the affordable housing market would threaten PEH's ability to locate low cost housing for its members and clients.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PEH alleges that the injuries it suffered could be redressed in two ways. First, by the district court setting aside the issuance of the enhanced vouchers. Second, by the district court using its equitable powers to order the Owners to extend the HAP contracts. We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's restraining order redressed PEH's alleged injuries. By granting a one year notice period, the district court gave PEH time to \"seek preservation alternatives,\" time to convince the owners to change their minds about renewing the HAP contracts, and time to provide \"effective educational assistance to tenants.\" There is simply no evidence that prohibiting HUD from issuing enhanced vouchers would have redressed PEH's alleged injuries. As for the \"adverse effects on the housing market,\" this injury is not related to or caused by the Owners' failure to supply the required notice. Put another way, even if the Owners had provided adequate notice from the very start, they could still have chosen not to renew the HAP contracts with HUD. As we have already explained, the applicable statutes simply do not require the Owners or HUD to renew the HAP contracts once they expire. For these reasons, we hold that PEH does not have standing to pursue its lawsuit because its alleged injuries, to the extent they can be redressed, have already been remedied by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's decisions to grant HUD's motion to dismiss and grant the Owners' motion for summary judgment are AFFIRMED.

(\"PEH\"), is a non-profit organization operating in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, which seeks to expand and preserve the supply of affordable housing in Rhode Island. Defendants-appellees in this case are the Develcos (the \"Owners\"), a group of four separately-owned but commonly managed housing developments located in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. The other defendants-appellees in this case are the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\") and its Secretary. PEH brought suit in federal district court challenging the expiration of low-income housing contracts between HUD and the Owners. The district court granted HUD's motion to dismiss and then granted summary judgment for the Owners. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm both rulings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This litigation revolves around the \"Section 8\" program created by HUD in 1974. The program is governed largely by the United States Housing Act of 1937, &#167; 8 as amended, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1437f (2003) (\"the Housing Act\"). We begin with a brief sketch of how this program works. The purpose of the program is to \"aid low-income families in obtaining a decent place to live and [promote] economically mixed housing.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1437f(a). Under the Section 8 program, HUD enters into Housing Assistance Payment (\"HAP\") contracts with private property owners and determines the maximum monthly rate that the owner may charge for each dwelling. Under the terms of the HAP contract, the property owner receives rent directly from two sources, the low-income tenant and HUD. The low-income tenants pay the property owner a percentage of their adjusted income, typically about 30 percent. The difference that remains between the HAP contract rent and the portion provided by the tenant is paid to the owner by HUD in the form of an assistance payment or subsidy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Owners are required to provide the Secretary of HUD and the low-income tenants \"not less than one year\" written notice of their intention to terminate any Section 8 HAP contract.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1437f(c)(8)(A). If the owner does not provide the proper notice, the owner may not evict the tenants or increase the tenants' rent until such time as the owner has provided the notice and the full one year has expired. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1437f(c)(8)(B). In circumstances when the HAP contracts expire, the Secretary and the owner may agree to renew the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Should the owner choose not to renew, the Housing Act dictates that HUD \"will provide tenant-based rental assistance to all eligible residents, enabling them to choose the place they wish to rent, which is likely to include the dwelling unit in which they currently reside.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1437f(c)(8)(A). If tenants choose to stay in the unit in which they currently reside, HUD issues those tenants \"enhanced vouchers.\" These vouchers cover the cost of any increase in rent that the owner of the dwelling may charge once the HAP contract expires, while keeping the tenants' portion of the rent stable at the pre-expiration rate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having described the basic mechanics of the Section 8 program, we now turn to the events that prompted this appeal. The Owners began providing affordable housing to low-income families pursuant to Section 8 HAP contracts in the mid-1970's. Since that time, the Owners and HUD entered into numerous renewal HAP contracts. The most recent HAP contracts were set to expire on May 31, 2001. Six weeks before the scheduled expiration date, the Owners sent the tenants a notice informing them that the HAP contracts would not be renewed. HUD, in coordination with the Woonsocket Housing Authority (\"WHA\"), subsequently issued enhanced vouchers to each eligible tenant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 30, 2001, the day before the HAP contracts were set to expire, PEH filed a complaint, a motion for a temporary restraining order and a motion for a preliminary injunction in the district court against the Owners, HUD and its Secretary, and the WHA. PEH raised two major issues in the complaint. First, PEH argued that the six weeks notice given to the tenants by the Owners failed to comply with the one year federal notice requirement. Second, PEH argued that HUD was acting in violation of federal law by approving the Owners' decision not to renew the expiring HAP contracts and by issuing enhanced vouchers to the tenants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 22, 2001, PEH moved to add the Develco Tenant Association (DTA), a group of Develco tenants, as a co-plaintiff with PEH. There were no objections to the motion and the complaint was amended to add DTA as a co-plaintiff. Shortly thereafter, the Owners agreed to a voluntary restraining order. The order prohibited the Owners from evicting or raising the rent on any tenant for one year, provided that the tenant was a participant in the Section 8 program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the restraining order was issued, HUD moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The district court, in a memorandum opinion dated March 29, 2002, granted the motion. The district court ruled that federal law did not obligate or even authorize HUD to \"unilaterally extend HAP contracts against the will of owners.\" Similarly, the district court stated that there was no statutory authorization which would require the Owners to continue participating in HAP contracts once they expired. The district court stated that the \"sole remedy for failing to provide the requisite notice is that the owner is prohibited from evicting tenants or increasing their rent payments until such notice has been provided and the prescribed notice period has elapsed.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With HUD dismissed from the case, the Owners and WHA moved for summary judgment. In a second memorandum opinion, dated October 16, 2002, the district court held that PEH and DTA lacked standing to pursue their complaint and granted the motion. The district court rejected PEH's request to require the Owners to continue renting units under the Section 8 HAP contracts. The court found that HUD's decision not to renew the expiring HAP contracts was a permissible exercise of HUD's discretion, and that since the contracts had expired, it was not possible to grant the relief requested. PEH filed this timely appeal challenging the district court's decision to dismiss PEH's claims against HUD and grant the Owners' motion for summary judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The DTA no longer exists and therefore has not joined in this appeal. No other Develco tenant joined PEH in this case at any time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We address first PEH's challenge to the district court's decision to dismiss HUD from this lawsuit for failure to state a claim. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). We review a district court's allowance of a motion to dismiss de novo. <i>See Martin v. Applied Cellular Tech., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199871\"><a href=\"/opinion/199871/martin-v-applied-cellular-tec/\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.2002). In doing so, \"[w]e accept as true the well-pleaded factual allegations of the complaint, draw all reasonable inferences therefrom in the plaintiff's favor and determine whether the complaint, so read, sets forth facts sufficient to justify recovery on any cognizable theory.\" <i>Id.</i> at 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PEH's complaint alleged that HUD violated a variety of federal laws, including the Housing Act, the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. &#167; 701 et seq. (2003), the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 3608(e)(5) (1994), and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution. Fairly read, the essence of these claims is that HUD illegally permitted the HAP contracts to expire. PEH alleges that HUD should have required the Owners to remain in the Section 8 program under HAP contracts until the one year notice period ended pursuant to the voluntary restraining order agreed to by the Owners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument, however, is forestalled by the clear language of the Housing Act. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1437f. When \"the language of a statute `is plain and admits of no more than one meaning ... the sole function of the courts is to enforce the statute according to its terms.'\" <i>Arnold v. United Parcel Serv., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197809\"><a href=\"/opinion/197809/arnold-v-united-parcel/\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">854</span></a></span>, 858 (1st Cir.1998) (quoting <i>Caminetti v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"98854\"><a href=\"/opinion/98854/caminetti-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">242</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">470</span></a></span>, 485, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">192</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">442</span></span> (1917)). Section (c)(8)(B) of the Housing Act states in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the event the owner does not provide the notice required, the owner may not evict the tenants or increase the tenants' rent payment until such time as the owner has provided the notice and 1 year has elapsed. The Secretary <i>may</i> allow the owner to renew the terminating contract for a period of time sufficient to give tenants 1 year of advance notice under such terms and conditions as the Secretary may require.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added). Congress' statement that the Secretary \"may allow\" the owner to renew the HAP contracts makes it apparent that HUD was not required to renew the Section 8 HAP contracts, even in the face of a notice violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PEH also argues that HUD should not have issued enhanced vouchers to the tenants once the Owners had provided inadequate notice. According to PEH, enhanced vouchers can only be issued when an owner provides proper notice and the one year notice period has expired. This argument is also contrary to the clear statutory language adopted by Congress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by noting that the Housing Act does not directly support PEH's argument. Section (c)(8)(B) of the statute, which was quoted above and describes how the Section 8 program works when an owner fails to give proper notice, does not mention enhanced vouchers, let alone prohibit their use. Rather, enhanced vouchers are covered under a different section of the statute. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1437f(t). This section states, in pertinent part, that \"the termination or expiration of the contract for rental assistance ... results in tenants... being eligible for enhanced voucher assistance under this subsection.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1437f(t)(2). There are, of course, exceptions. These include instances when a tenant leaves the covered project or when the voucher is used by someone other than the family who was originally issued the voucher. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1437f(t)(1)(C). But Congress did not include in this list of exceptions an owner's failure to give proper notice. That fact certainly does not help PEH's argument. <i>See Com. of Mass. by Dept. of Public Welfare v. Yeutter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"570484\"><a href=\"/opinion/570484/commonwealth-of-massachusetts-by-its-department-of-public-welfare-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">947</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">537</span></a></span>, 542 (1st Cir.1991) (finding it relevant that \"[n]owhere in this section do the drafters suggest that the Secretary may not request information and materials beyond those specified as forbidden fruit\"). But it also does not end the matter. <i>See Stoutt v. Banco Popular de P.R.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780929\"><a href=\"/opinion/780929/palmer-paxton-stoutt-rancal-international-inc-rancal-corp-ltd-v-banco/\"><span class=\"volume\">320</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 30 (1st Cir.2003) (stating that omissions in statutory language are not necessarily conclusive because \"[c]ourts have often added to statutes unexpressed conditions or qualifications consonant with statutory purpose or other public concerns\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More important is that the section of the Housing Act describing enhanced vouchers, <i>see</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1437f(t)(2), explicitly defines when a tenant may be eligible for enhanced vouchers. This section references the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997, Pub.L. No. 105-65, 111 Stat. 1344 (codified at 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1437f) (\"MAHRA\"). The MAHRA, in turn, provides that when a Section 8 contract is \"not renewed ... the Secretary <i>shall make enhanced voucher assistance ... available</i> on behalf of each low-income family who, upon the date of such expiration, is residing in an assisted dwelling unit in the covered project.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 524(d)(1) (emphasis added). This provision applies to a \"contract [that] will (under its own terms) expire during the period consisting of fiscal years 2000 through 2004.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 524(d)(2)(A)(VII). That is precisely the situation we face in this case. The HAP contracts between the Owners and HUD expired on May 31, 2001. Upon expiration of the HAP contracts, the MAHRA requires HUD to issue the enhanced vouchers if a tenant chooses to remain in the same unit. HUD did so. In light of this clear statutory language, we simply cannot agree with PEH's argument that HUD acted improperly when it issued enhanced vouchers to the tenants in this case. <i>See Riva v. Comm. of Mass.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196227\"><a href=\"/opinion/196227/riva-v-commonwealth-of-ma/\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1003</span></a></span>, 1007 (1st Cir.1995) (\"In statutory construction case, beginning point must be language of statute, and when statute speaks with clarity to an issue, judicial inquiry into statute's meaning, in all but the most extraordinary circumstance, is finished.\" (quoting <i>Estate of Cowart v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">379</span></a></span> (1992))).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PEH challenges this clear statutory language by drawing our attention to a document that it considers \"new pertinent and significant legal authority.\" The document is related to testimony that HUD provided at a Senate Subcommittee hearing on affordable housing preservation on October 9, 2002. Following the hearing, the subcommittee issued a series of follow-up questions to HUD, some of which dealt with HUD's handling of the Section 8 program. PEH cites to the written responses that HUD provided to the questions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PEH presents this document to us as a supplemental letter, as authorized by Fed. R.App. P. 28(j). HUD argues that we should not consider PEH's document because supplemental authority as defined by Rule 28(j) is generally understood to refer to new case law, which PEH's document is certainly not. We decline to define the contours of the rule, and choose instead to assume without deciding that it is permissible for us to consider PEH's document.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That said, we are not persuaded that the document helps advance PEH's argument in any meaningful way. This is because HUD's answers are inconsistent with PEH's position. HUD's answers, it seems to us, conform to our reading of the relevant statutes. For example, HUD states that it \"does not have the legal authority to compel an unwilling owner to execute new project-based assistance contracts or to unilaterally prevent the contract from expiring.\" HUD goes on to explain that \"[i]n cases where improper notice has been provided, eligible families residing in the property will still be issued enhanced vouchers when the contract expires.\" Perhaps most important of all is HUD's statement that \"even if the notices given by the owners were not adequate, HUD would still have been compelled by Section 524(d)(1) of MAHRA to issue enhanced vouchers to all eligible residents ... on the date in which the project-based Section 8 contract expired.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PEH does not discuss or explain these statements by HUD. Instead, PEH calls our attention to one section of a single paragraph of the document which states, in relevant part, \"the owner will not receive any voucher assistance payments until proper notice has been provided to the tenants.\" Read in isolation, this statement would support PEH's argument. Read in context, however, it does not. This is because it does not appear that the above statement was the policy of HUD at the time of the events in question here. Rather, it seems to us that the statement is a prediction of a future policy that HUD may adopt. We take this view because as part of its answer HUD indicated that it was revising its current policies. Up to the present time, however, HUD stated that it did not withhold enhanced vouchers as a tool to force compliance with the Housing Act's notice requirement. This reading of the answer is consistent with the many other statements made by HUD throughout the document, as well as this litigation, in which it claimed that enhanced vouchers have not been denied to tenants when an owner gave improper notice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether the document is referring to HUD's policy in the future, or HUD's policy at the time the document was written is of little consequence. The important point is that the document does not show that HUD's policies, <i>as they existed at the time relevant to this case,</i> prohibited the issuance of enhanced vouchers when an owner gave improper notice. Simply put, we do not find the new authority offered by PEH to be persuasive or relevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PEH also argues that a guidebook published by HUD regarding its Section 8 renewal policies demonstrates that HUD is prohibited from issuing enhanced vouchers when improper notice is given. The guidebook is dated January, 2001, and therefore was presumably in effect at the times relevant to this appeal. PEH focuses on the guidebook's statement that \"[i]f proper notification was not provided ... HUD/CA will offer the owner a short-term contract.\" The guidebook, however, does not say that HUD is prohibited from issuing enhanced vouchers. Even if it did, HUD could not use its own guidebook to contravene the clear Congressional commands, described above, that are contained in the Housing Act and the MAHRA. <i>See Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v.

The DTA has not joined in this appeal, although they were plaintiffs below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also briefly pause to address an argument made by the Owners that PEH waived its arguments as to standing because it failed to address the issue in its opening brief.

By the time it reached the summary judgment stage, the district court had already issued a restraining order prohibiting the Owners from evicting the tenants or raising their rent for one year. The district court had also dismissed HUD from the litigation. Therefore, the question before us is whether PEH continued to have standing after these two important events. More specifically, we are concerned with whether the relief PEH requested from the district court would remedy its alleged injuries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To make this determination it is important to define with precision PEH's alleged injuries. In its appellate brief, PEH states that the actions of the Owners caused it to suffer three injuries. PEH claims that: (1) it was denied an opportunity to seek preservation alternatives to the contract termination; (2) it was prevented from providing effective educational assistance to tenants; and (3) the adverse effects on the affordable housing market would threaten PEH's ability to locate low cost housing for its members and clients.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PEH alleges that the injuries it suffered could be redressed in two ways. First, by the district court setting aside the issuance of the enhanced vouchers. Second, by the district court using its equitable powers to order the Owners to extend the HAP contracts. We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's restraining order redressed PEH's alleged injuries. By granting a one year notice period, the district court gave PEH time to \"seek preservation alternatives,\" time to convince the owners to change their minds about renewing the HAP contracts, and time to provide \"effective educational assistance to tenants.\" There is simply no evidence that prohibiting HUD from issuing enhanced vouchers would have redressed PEH's alleged injuries. As for the \"adverse effects on the housing market,\" this injury is not related to or caused by the Owners' failure to supply the required notice. Put another way, even if the Owners had provided adequate notice from the very start, they could still have chosen not to renew the HAP contracts with HUD. As we have already explained, the applicable statutes simply do not require the Owners or HUD to renew the HAP contracts once they expire. For these reasons, we hold that PEH does not have standing to pursue its lawsuit because its alleged injuries, to the extent they can be redressed, have already been remedied by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.
