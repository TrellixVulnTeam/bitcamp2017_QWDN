In 1995, Ernesto Cirilo-Muñoz\n\n(“Cirilo”)    was   convicted   of   aiding    and   abetting,   during   the\n\ncommission of a drug crime, the murder of an on-duty policeman.\n\nThis court affirmed the conviction.            United States v. Mangual-\n\nCorchado, 139 F.3d 34 (1st Cir. 1998).           Cirilo thereafter sought\n\nrelief under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 (2000), which was denied by the\n\ndistrict court, and now seeks review in this court, attacking his\n\nsentence based on ineffective assistance of counsel and under\n\nBlakely v. Washington, 124 S. Ct. 2531 (2004), and United States v.\n\nBooker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005).\n\n           Our earlier opinion sets forth the facts in detail but,\n\nin substance, the following is what occurred. Jose Lugo-Sanchez\n\n(“Lugo”), Saul Mangual-Corchado (“Mangual”) and David Silva worked\n\nregular shifts selling drugs outside Cafetín El Ideal–-a retail\n\nshop where customers could also drink and play pool--in Trujillo\n\nAlto, Puerto Rico.     Cirilo also frequented El Ideal and was said\n\n(by El Ideal’s owner) to be “almost always” with Mangual and Lugo,\n\nalthough there was no evidence that he sold drugs.\n\n             Lugo correctly suspected that one drug customer–-Agent\n\nIvan Mejias-Hernandez (“Mejias”)–-was in fact an undercover police\n\nofficer.   In October 1994, one of Lugo’s suppliers ordered Lugo to\n\nkill Mejias, and Lugo in turn told Luis Antonio Ramirez-Ynoa\n\n(“Ramirez”) of his plan.    On November 1, 1994, Mejias arrived at El\n\nIdeal between 10:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. driving a white Suzuki.            At\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\faround 11:15 a.m., Lugo called Ramirez on the phone from El Ideal,\n\ntelling him to drive to El Ideal and to bring “the revolver.”1\n\nRamirez arrived by 12:30 p.m. with a black Oldsmobile and a\n\nrevolver.\n\n            Ten to fifteen minutes later, Cirilo arrived at El Ideal\n\nand was greeted by Lugo.          Shortly thereafter, Lugo and Mejias\n\nwalked to the stoop of a nearby building, where Lugo accused Mejias\n\nof being an informant.     Silva and Ramirez arrived at the stoop, and\n\nLugo walked back toward El Ideal, retrieving the revolver from the\n\nOldsmobile and concealing it.       Walking back toward El Ideal again,\n\nLugo encountered Cirilo, Mangual and one Yito Morales, and tried\n\nunsuccessfully to incite them to “beat up” Mejias.\n\n            Then   Lugo,   with   several   others   (possibly    including\n\nCirilo), returned to the stoop.           There Lugo ordered Mejias at\n\ngunpoint to turn over the keys to the Suzuki.         Ramirez and Mangual\n\nthen searched the Suzuki and retrieved Mejias’ gun.              Cirilo was\n\nstanding “real close to the car but not searching,” just “looking”;\n\nhis fingerprints were found on the Suzuki, although no evidence was\n\npresented as to when he touched the car.\n\n            Mejias, escorted by Lugo, then returned to the Suzuki\n\nfrom the stoop and retrieved his keys.        Lugo told him to get into\n\nthe car and “not to come around there anymore.”        However, as Mejias\n\n\n\n     1\n      Quotes such as these throughout this decision are taken from\nthe trial transcript.\n\n                                    -3-\n\fwas about to leave, another man called “Papilin” told Lugo, “You\n\nhave to take him or kill him because he might come back.”      There\n\nwas no direct evidence that Cirilo heard this exchange, and the\n\nevidence was unclear as to where Cirilo was standing (or where\n\nPapilin and Lugo were standing) when this command was given.\n\n            Lugo then ordered Mejias into the Suzuki, and Mangual\n\ndrove the Suzuki onto the highway with Mejias and Lugo in the back\n\nseat.    Shortly thereafter, Lugo shot Mejias in the abdomen and in\n\nthe head.    Cirilo and Ramirez followed in the Oldsmobile, with\n\nCirilo driving, although there was no evidence as to why.      Lugo\n\nlater testified that he had not told Cirilo about the planned\n\nmurder and that he (Lugo) had not asked that Cirilo follow.2\n\n            The cars stopped at a cemetery. Whether Mejias was still\n\nalive is unclear but in any event Ramirez shot Mejias twice more in\n\nthe head.    The men then drove in the two cars to a quarry (during\n\nthe drive Cirilo ingested cocaine provided by Lugo); the Suzuki\n\n(with Mejias’ body in it) was pushed into the quarry.   The men then\n\nleft the quarry in the Oldsmobile driven by Cirilo.   Lugo split the\n\n$240 he had taken from Mejias’ wallet with the others.       Cirilo\n\nfinally drove Lugo home.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      It should be noted that Lugo had also told two different and\nlater-recanted versions of events to the FBI before trial, at least\none of which incriminated Cirilo. Given Cirilo’s conviction, it is\nuncertain whether the jury credited Lugo’s exculpatory statement at\ntrial.\n\n                                 -4-\n\f           Mangual, Ramirez, Lugo and Cirilo were apprehended and,\n\nin September 1995, Cirilo was convicted after a jury trial in\n\nfederal court of aiding and abetting the murder of an on-duty law-\n\nenforcement officer during the commission of a drug offense, 21\n\nU.S.C. § 848(e)(1)(B) (2000); 18 U.S.C. § 2 (2000).         On appeal,\n\nCirilo argued that the evidence was insufficient to establish the\n\naiding and abetting offense but, with one judge dissenting on this\n\nissue, the conviction was affirmed.      Mangual, 139 F.3d at 44-49;\n\nid. at 49-56 (McAuliffe, J., dissenting in part).\n\n           At sentencing in January 1996, the district judge found\n\nthat Mejias’ killing was motivated by his status as a police\n\nofficer,   resulting   in   a   three-level   enhancement   under   the\n\nsentencing guidelines, U.S.S.G. § 3A1.2(a).      This raised Cirilo’s\n\nsentencing range from about 27 to 34 years, to required life\n\nimprisonment. At sentencing Cirilo’s trial counsel objected to the\n\nenhancement, arguing that the government had not shown that Cirilo\n\nknew that Mejias was a police officer.    The issue was not raised on\n\nappeal.\n\n           On September 29, 1999, Cirilo filed a petition for post-\n\nconviction relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 (2000),3 attacking his\n\nsentence in various respects.        The district court denied the\n\n\n     3\n      Under section 2255, a federal court that imposed a sentence\nmay vacate or correct it if “the sentence was imposed in violation\nof the Constitution or laws of the United States . . . or . . . the\nsentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law, or is\notherwise subject to collateral attack.”\n\n                                  -5-\n\fpetition, concluding inter alia that the court at sentencing had\n\ncorrectly applied the enhancement and that the lawyer’s failure to\n\nraise the issue on appeal did not violate Cirilo’s constitutional\n\nrights.   We granted a certificate of appealability, id. § 2253(c),\n\ndirected to this claim and later broadened review to encompass a\n\nSixth Amendment claim as well.\n\n            An ineffective assistance claim requires the defendant–-\n\nwho bears the burden of proof, Scarpa v. DuBois, 38 F.3d 1, 8-9\n\n(1st Cir. 1994)–-to show (1) that counsel’s performance fell below\n\nan objective standard of reasonableness, and (2) that but for\n\ncounsel’s failures, the outcome would likely have been different.\n\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984); Cofske v.\n\nUnited States, 290 F.3d 437, 441 (1st Cir. 2002).             We review the\n\ndistrict court’s underlying factual findings for clear error, but\n\nreview its ultimate legal conclusions de novo.           Reyes-Vejerano v.\n\nUnited States, 276 F.3d 94, 97 (1st Cir. 2002); Cody v. United\n\nStates, 249 F.3d 47, 52 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n            Because counsel is entitled to exercise professional\n\njudgment,   Cirilo   must   show   that   an   attack   on   his   sentencing\n\nenhancement on direct appeal “was so obvious and promising that no\n\ncompetent lawyer could have failed to pursue it.” Arroyo v. United\n\nStates, 195 F.3d 54, 55 (1st Cir. 1999).         We believe that test is\n\nmet in this instance: the enhancement, which had a dramatic effect\n\n\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fon the sentence, rested on very thin evidence and a possible\n\nmisinterpretation of the jury verdict by the district court.\n\n            During the sentencing hearing, the judge asked (and was\n\nanswered in the affirmative), “Didn’t the jury find that this\n\nvictim was killed . . . because he was a police officer?”             Later\n\n(during a discussion of a minor-participant adjustment), Cirilo’s\n\nlawyer   suggested    that   even   though   Cirilo   followed   in     the\n\nOldsmobile, “that doesn’t mean that [Cirilo] knew that [Lugo] was\n\ngoing to kill and that [Mejias] was a police officer.       He may have\n\nbeen surprised when--”.      The court responded “that’s what the jury\n\ndecided.”\n\n            If the district judge was referring to knowledge of\n\nMejias’ status, this is not what the jury had decided; the court’s\n\ninstructions to the jury stated that “[k]nowledge of the victim’s\n\nstatus as a law enforcement officer is not necessarily an element\n\nof the offense.”      Although the jury was instructed that Cirilo\n\nneeded to know that murder was intended, the jury was not required\n\nby the instruction to find that Cirilo knew that the victim was a\n\npolice officer.4     The distinction between levels of knowledge is a\n\nfine one but it mattered to the particular enhancement.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      Whether 21 U.S.C. § 848(e)(1)(B) itself or its aiding-and-\nabetting variant require knowledge of the victim’s status as a\npolice officer is not clearly addressed by circuit case law, but\nthe jury instructions in this case said that such knowledge was not\nnecessarily required.\n\n                                    -7-\n\f          Whether this possible misperception affected the district\n\njudge’s ruling is unclear. In the sentencing hearing, the district\n\njudge did make a formal finding that Cirilo knew that the victim\n\nwas a police officer when he (Cirilo) assisted in the venture.   But\n\nthere was no detailed discussion by the district judge of the\n\nevidence on which such a finding might rest.     Ordinarily it is\n\nenough that sufficient evidence exist, but in this instance the\n\nevidence is thin and the basis for the inference drawn by the\n\ndistrict judge is not apparent to us.\n\n          The conviction itself rested on fairly limited evidence\n\nof scienter, but an inference that Cirilo was involved in the plot\n\ncould be drawn from Cirilo’s presence at the scene of incitement\n\nand threat, his prints on the car, his otherwise unexplained\n\npursuit of the Suzuki with a party to the plot, his presence when\n\nthe victim was shot again and his sharing of the proceeds.   Other\n\ncontextual clues were the other perpetrators’ willing acceptance of\n\nCirilo’s presence during the events leading up to Mejias’ death,\n\nand evidence of Cirilo’s indebtedness to Lugo’s supplier which may\n\nhave given Cirilo a motive to assist.\n\n          It is much harder, on what we can find in this record and\n\nwithout more explanation, to see why Cirilo should be taken to have\n\nknown that the intended victim was a police officer.5     Cirilo’s\n\n\n     5\n      The guideline, unlike the statute, explicitly requires that\nCirilo’s offense have been “motivated by” Mejias’ status as an\nofficer.    U.S.S.G. § 3A1.2(a).    This ordinarily would entail\n\n                               -8-\n\fconduct and continued presence may be difficult to explain if he\n\nwere not aware that Mejias would be killed; the panel that affirmed\n\nthe conviction so reasoned.    But even with this awareness, Cirilo\n\nmight have thought that Mejias was an informant or a member of a\n\nrival drug supply organization; or Cirilo might have assisted his\n\nassociates’ efforts to kill a man without knowing just why they\n\nwere doing it.   Had any of these been Cirilo’s motivation, the\n\nenhancement would not apply.\n\n          Although Lugo at one point testified that he suspected\n\nMejias of being “a police officer,” he also testified that he had\n\nconfronted Mejias and told him that “as far as I was concerned he\n\nwas a police informant” and “a snitch,” and that he told Silva to\n\nfind out if Mejias was really “a police informant or what.”\n\nParticularly if Lugo’s expressed concern was that Mejias was an\n\ninformant (and not that he was an officer), it is unclear why the\n\ndistrict judge thought that Cirilo knew or believed Mejias was a\n\npolice officer and thus that his assistance in the murder was\n\nmotivated by Mejias’ official status.\n\n          The government says that the omission of the enhancement\n\nissue on direct appeal was simply a “tactical judgment.” Murchu v.\n\n\n\nknowledge or belief that the victim is an officer, see, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Garcia, 34 F.3d 6, 13 (1st Cir. 1994) (knowledge\nof victim’s status established motivation); United States v. Salim,\n287 F. Supp. 2d 250, 307-08 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (same), and at least\none court has said that knowledge is necessary. United States v.\nPark, 988 F.2d 107, 110 (11th Cir. 1993).\n\n                                -9-\n\fUnited States, 926 F.2d 50, 58 (1st Cir. 1991).       Yet the argument\n\nwould not have detracted from the evidentiary challenge to the\n\nconviction but would have built upon it.           It had the further\n\nadvantage of focusing on the district court’s arguable conflation\n\nof the two different scienter issues.         And it represented the\n\ndifference between a long jail sentence and a life sentence.        One\n\nwould need a potent reason for omitting the enhancement argument\n\nfrom the direct appeal.\n\n          Assuming   that   the    omission   of   the   argument   was\n\ndeliberate, the best one can say for counsel is this: that in some\n\nsituations lawyers think--usually in error--that by omitting a good\n\nargument, they can thereby increase the chance of prevailing on a\n\nmore doubtful argument directed to a more far-reaching result.\n\nHowever, in this instance, such a calculation would have been\n\nmanifestly unreasonable under an objective standard, given the\n\ncomparative strengths of the two different attacks, the opportunity\n\nto make both, and the stakes for the defendant.\n\n          The second stage of the Strickland inquiry requires a\n\n“reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional\n\nerrors, the result . . . would have been different.”          Epsom v.\n\nHall, 330 F.3d 49, 53 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S.\n\nat 694) (omission in original).    We think that had the enhancement\n\nissue been pressed on direct appeal, it would have altered the\n\noutcome of the appeal.    This is so because of the thinness of the\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fevidence   to   support   the   enhancement,    the   lack   of    detailed\n\nexplanation for the finding of knowledge, and the court’s apparent\n\nerror in relying at least in part upon the jury verdict for a\n\nfinding that the jury did not visibly make.\n\n           Some errors that result in a defendant losing the benefit\n\nof his appeal may be remedied by reinstating the appeal, see United\n\nStates v. Torres-Otero, 232 F.3d 24, 30-32 (1st Cir. 2000), but in\n\nthis instance our second-stage Strickland ruling renders this\n\ninterim step    pointless.      The   government   has   already   had   its\n\nopportunity on this appeal to defend the enhancement, and we\n\nalready know that our own disposition of the direct appeal would\n\nhave been to remand for re-sentencing.         We therefore do so now.\n\n           We have had to make our assessment of the constitutional\n\nclaim based on our own unaided review of the record and without any\n\nclear understanding of the district judge’s reasoning in finding\n\nthat Cirilo knew in advance of the crime that the victim was a\n\npolice officer.   Conceivably, on re-sentencing, the government may\n\nagain urge that such knowledge existed.         Without foreclosing such\n\nan argument by the government, we are highly skeptical that such a\n\npremise can be established or that a life sentence can be justified\n\non the known facts.\n\n           Cirilo’s brief may be taken to raise a separate claim\n\nunder section 2255 that his sentence should be vacated because the\n\nenhancement was supported by inadequate evidence.            This issue--\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\funlike the ineffective assistance claim covered by the certificate\n\nof appealability and the Sixth Amendment claim that we later\n\nexpressly permitted Cirilo to pursue–-is not properly before us as\n\nan independent claim.     Further, the use of section 2255 to attack\n\nsentencing findings is, if permissible, at best limited to very\n\nunusual cases.    It also is likely that on remand the issue will\n\ndisappear from the court.\n\n            As part of his section 2255 petition, Cirilo filed a\n\nsupplemental brief seeking additional review of his sentencing in\n\nlight of the Supreme Court’s decision in Blakely v. Washington, 124\n\nS. Ct. 2531 (2004), which we allowed.        Cirilo urges resentencing\n\nbecause the jury did not find beyond a reasonable doubt that he\n\nbelieved that Mejias was a police officer.        Blakely claims are now\n\nviewed through the lens of United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738\n\n(2005).\n\n            Only in limited circumstances do new rules apply to\n\nconvictions that have already become final.       Schriro v. Summerlin,\n\n124 S. Ct. 2519, 2522 (2004).6        These exceptions include rules\n\nthat “prohibit criminal punishment for certain types of primary\n\nconduct,”   and   those   that   “forbid   the   imposition   of   certain\n\n\n\n     6\n      Cirilo’s conviction became final in 1998, when certiorari as\nto the direct appeal was denied. Cirilo-Muñoz v. United States,\n525 U.S. 942 (1998). Because finality preceded even Apprendi v.\nNew Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), Booker certainly announced a “new\nrule” to which the described retroactivity doctrine applies. See\nBeard v. Banks, 124 S. Ct. 2504, 2511 (2004).\n\n                                  -12-\n\fcategories of punishment for particular classes of defendants.”\n\nSepulveda v. United States, 330 F.3d 55, 59 (1st Cir. 2003); see\n\nSchriro, 124 S. Ct. at 2522-23.                Neither rubric describes this\n\ncase.\n\n            Otherwise, new rules are applied retroactively to cases\n\nalready final      only   if     they   are    “watershed   rules      of   criminal\n\nprocedure implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the\n\ncriminal proceeding.”            Schriro, 124 S. Ct. at 2523 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).           Cirilo’s version of the error (under\n\nBlakely) was that the enhancement finding was made by the judge\n\nbased on a preponderance of the evidence; Booker has preserved the\n\nuse   of   judge-made     findings      by    directing   that   the    guidelines\n\nhereafter be treated as advisory rather than mandatory guidelines.\n\nSee United States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 75 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).\n\n            In our view, the use of judge-made findings at sentencing\n\ndoes not undermine “accuracy” (in terms of substantially different\n\noutcomes) or undermine fundamental fairness.                     Such judge-made\n\nfindings    have   been    the    conventional      practice     throughout      our\n\nnation’s history.       They will, post-Booker, continue to be the rule\n\nwhere the sentence is within statutory limits.                   We have already\n\ndecided that Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 430, which provides jury trials\n\nfor increasing statutory maximums, would not apply retroactively.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\fSee Sepulveda, 330 F.3d at 61-63.           This resolves any comparable\n\nBlakely-like claim in this circuit.\n\n            As for the application of mandatory rather than advisory\n\nguidelines, it is unclear that advisory guidelines will alter a\n\ngreat number of sentences; mandatory minimums imposed by statute\n\nare another question altogether.         The guidelines remain a central\n\nconsideration in sentencing; and sentencing courts must still\n\nconsider the same statutory factors that the Sentencing Commission\n\nwas required to use in promulgating the guidelines.               See 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3553(a) (2000); 28 U.S.C. § 994(m) (2000).           To describe the use\n\nof   mandatory   guidelines     as   generating    serious       inaccuracy   or\n\nfundamental unfairness would not be easy.\n\n            Realistically, it is unlikely that the Supreme Court will\n\nadopt   a   retroactivity     analysis      that   opens    up    to   required\n\nreexamination practically all of the federal sentences imposed\n\nsince the guidelines went into effect in 1987. This would comprise\n\ntens of     thousands   of   sentences   imposed    under    a    regime   whose\n\nlawfulness was assumed during most of this period.               If such a vast\n\nreopening of final judgments is required, it must await a decision\n\nof the Supreme Court.        Certainly Booker itself does not give any\n\nclear hint that retroactive effect is intended.\n\n            Every other circuit that has considered this issue has\n\nagreed that Booker does not apply retroactively.                 See Varela v.\n\nUnited States, 400 F.3d 864, 866-68 (11th Cir. 2005); Humphress v.\n\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fUnited States, 398 F.3d 855, 860-63 (6th Cir. 2005); McReynolds v.\n\nUnited States, 397 F.3d 479, 480-81 (7th Cir. 2005); United States\n\nv. Mitchell, 2005 WL 387974, at *1 (2d Cir. Feb. 18, 2005)\n\n(unpublished); United States v. Leonard, 2005 WL 139183, at *2\n\n(10th Cir. Jan. 24, 2005) (unpublished).\n\n          Cirilo’s sentence is vacated and the matter remanded to\n\nJudge Laffitte for resentencing.   We leave it to the parties and to\n\nthe district court to resolve in the first instance whether this\n\nnew sentencing, which will occur post-Booker, should be governed by\n\nthe advisory guideline regime.     Although failure to use advisory\n\nguidelines is not the basis for the remand, the issue of their use\n\nonce the remand is ordered on other grounds remains open for\n\nresolution.7\n\n          It is so ordered\n\n\n\n                       Concurrence Follows.\n\n\n\n\n     7\n      We note that several courts of appeals have said that the\nadvisory guidelines regime is to be used after Booker, even where\nremands for resentencing were not caused by a Booker error. See,\ne.g., United States v. Gutierrez-Ramirez, ___ F.3d ___, 2005 WL\n762664, at *6 (5th Cir. Apr. 5, 2005); United States v. Doe, 398\nF.3d 1254, 1261 n.9 (10th Cir. 2005); United States v. Gleich, 397\nF.3d 608, 615 (8th Cir. 2005).\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\f           TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge (Concurring).\n\n           Lugo's cold-blooded murder of Officer Mejías\n           was as horrible a crime as can be committed.\n           On that point we can agree. If the horrible\n           nature of the murder added some weight to the\n           record evidence supporting the aiding and\n           abetting charge against Cirilo-[Muñoz], then I\n           would gladly join my colleagues in affirming\n           his conviction. But it does not.\n\nUnited States v. Mangual-Corchado, 139 F.3d 34, 49 (McAuliffe, J.,\n\ndissenting in part). This is the dissenting judge's view on direct\n\nappeal regarding the sufficiency of evidence on the aiding and\n\nabetting charge, a matter which we are presently foreclosed from\n\nrevisiting on the merits. Nevertheless, the facts surrounding this\n\nconclusion are not irrelevant to the issues before us.       This is\n\nparticularly so in light of the majority's recognition, especially\n\nin its discussion of appellant's claim of ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel,   of   the     \"thinness\"   of   the   evidence   supporting\n\nCirilo-Muñoz's knowledge that the victim was a police officer. See\n\nmaj. op. at 7, 8, 10.\n\n           I write separately in part because I have considerable\n\ndisagreement with the majority's glossing of the events as they\n\nunfolded prior to the police officer's murder by Lugo. Although my\n\nview of the relevant facts might, at first glance, appear to bog\n\ndown on minor details, those facts are significant precisely\n\nbecause of the \"thinness\" of the case against Cirilo-Muñoz, and\n\nbecause that \"thinness\" is on a broader scale than my colleagues in\n\nthe majority acknowledge.\n\n                                 -16-\n\f            First, there is no evidence that Cirilo-Muñoz was present\n\nat \"El Ideal\" on the day in question as part of Lugo's drug-selling\n\ngang.    Cirilo-Muñoz lived only five minutes' walking distance from\n\nthis neighborhood hangout, which he regularly frequented to listen\n\nto music, play pool and talk to other youths.   There is no evidence\n\nthat he sold drugs, although the record does show that he was a\n\ndrug user.      Second, there is no evidence that Cirilo-Muñoz's\n\npresence at \"El Ideal\" on November 1, 1994, was at the behest of\n\nLugo or of anyone in his gang.    When he arrived, Lugo was already\n\nthere, and the evidence is uncontradicted that Cirilo-Muñoz was\n\nunaware of the reason for Lugo's presence and his intent to harm\n\nthe undercover police officer, Mejías.      In fact, the record is\n\nclear that later, when Lugo tried to incite several of those\n\npresent to \"beat up\" Mejías, appellant flat out refused to do so.8\n\nFurthermore, there is no evidence, and no valid inference can be\n\nmade from the record, that Cirilo-Muñoz was on the stoop at any\n\ntime on November 1st when Lugo and his cohorts were accosting Agent\n\nMejías.    The majority's statement to the effect that Cirilo-Muñoz\n\n\"possibly\" was on the stoop, maj. op. at 3, is pure speculation.\n\nIn fact, the evidence is to the effect that Cirilo-Muñoz did not\n\nexit \"El Ideal\" until after Ramírez and Mangual came out of the\n\nstoop to search Mejías's car for the agent's gun. Cirilo-Muñoz did\n\n     8\n      It would seem that if Cirilo-Muñoz was disinclined to \"rough\"\nMejías up, he would even be less agreeable to aid in his murder, a\nfact that, as I will further discuss, is borne out by Lugo's\nexculpatory evidence.\n\n                                 -17-\n\fnot    participate   in    the   search   and   \"was   just   looking.\"   The\n\nfingerprints found on Mejías's car matching Cirilo-Muñoz supports\n\nthis account, as they were all lifted from the exterior portions of\n\nthe car.   No evidence exists as to when they were imprinted there.\n\n            It is with regard to the evidence surrounding the murder\n\nof Agent Mejías that I find the majority's statement of the facts\n\nmost problematic because I believe it unfairly places an aura of\n\nknowledge of the events to follow on appellant.           This implication\n\nof knowledge is unsupported by the \"thin\" record, so \"thin\" that\n\nthe government, who is the one properly called upon to meet this\n\nburden under our system of justice, has verily skated through the\n\nice.\n\n            In this regard, the majority states that \"[t]here was no\n\ndirect evidence that Cirilo-[Muñoz]\" heard the exchange between\n\nLugo and \"Papilín\" in which \"Papilín\" told Lugo to \"take or kill\"\n\nMejías, and that \"the evidence was unclear as to where Cirilo-\n\n[Muñoz] was standing (or where Papilín and Lugo were standing) when\n\nthis command was given.\" Maj. op. at 4.          If that is so -- i.e., if\n\nthe evidence is not direct and is unclear -- what should follow,\n\nconsidering that this is a criminal case in which the unstated\n\npremise of these statements carries serious consequences for the\n\nappellant, is a statement by the majority to the effect that no\n\ninference of knowledge regarding this conversation may be imputed\n\nupon Cirilo-Muñoz.        But no such disclaimer is made.       Instead, we\n\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\fare left with the worst kind of imputation, a half-inference, a\n\nlingering doubt as to what appellant has to answer for, and a vague\n\nquestion mark as to what weight is actually being given by the\n\ncourt to this non-evidence.\n\n                This rustling of soft \"evidence\" is followed by the\n\nmajority's        downgrading    of    the   only   direct   evidence   presented\n\nregarding Cirilo-Muñoz's lack of knowledge of Mejías's fate. See\n\nMaj. op. at 4, n.3.        Lugo, the person who actually murdered Mejías,\n\nand who took the stand as a government witness, testified that\n\nafter he shot Mejías upon leaving \"El Ideal\" in a car with Mangual,\n\nhe observed that Cirilo-Muñoz and Ramírez were following them in\n\nanother car. Lugo testified that he had not asked Cirilo-Muñoz and\n\nRamírez to follow them.          In fact, Lugo testified that Cirilo-Muñoz\n\nonly knew about beating Mejías, but that at that time \"didn't know\n\nthat he was going to be killed.\"9             Although the majority points to\n\nLugo's earlier statement to the F.B.I. that incriminated appellant,\n\nthis statement was made when Lugo was looking to make a deal for\n\nhimself with the government.            By the time of trial, however,         Lugo\n\nno longer had anything to gain by wrongly implicating Cirilo-Muñoz.\n\n                In light of the full factual background of this appeal,\n\nI   am       concerned   about   the   majority's     decision   to   remand    for\n\nresentencing to the same judge who sentenced appellant originally\n\n         9\n      Even Mangual, the driver of the Oldsmobile carrying Lugo and\nAgent Mejías, was shocked and lost control of the car when Lugo\nfirst shot Mejías. Mangual asked \"What did you do?,\" to which Lugo\nresponded \"Keep driving or you're next.\"\n\n                                         -19-\n\fand who also decided his § 2255 petition.   This judge had two bites\n\nat the apple to do so, and in each instance insisted that the\n\n\"whole picture\" supports Cirilo-Muñoz's enhancement.10   Yet our own\n\nexamination of the entire trial transcript failed to produce any\n\nevidence establishing Cirilo-Muñoz's knowledge of the victim's\n\nstatus as an officer.11   The majority's failure to address the\n\n     10\n      The district judge stated that he looked at the \"whole\npicture\" to infer that the \"defendant knew that the victim was a\npolice officer and [that] he was being killed because he was a\npolice officer.\"    As evidentiary support, the judge cited the\nfollowing: (1) Cirilo-Muñoz's arrival 10-15 minutes after Ramírez's\narrival; (2) the proximity between the stoop and El Ideal; (3)\nLugo's solicitation of Cirilo-Muñoz and others to \"beat up\" Mejías;\n(4) Cirilo-Muñoz getting into the car with Ramírez; (5) the\ninference that Cirilo-Muñoz and Ramírez must have heard the two\nshots from the Oldsmobile; and (6) Cirilo-Muñoz following in the\ncar, sharing in the money, and driving Lugo home. However, even if\nwe take all these facts in the light most favorable to the court's\ninterpretation, the aggregate fails to establish Cirilo-Muñoz's\nknowledge of Mejías's status as an officer. The proffered evidence\nalso falls significantly short of instances where we have found\nsuch \"reasonable belief\" of the victim's status to support the\nenhancement. See United States v. García, 34 F.3d 6, 13 (1st Cir.\n1994) (record supports § 3A1.2 enhancement because evidence\nindicated that the police officers displayed their identification\nas they approached defendant and yelled \"police\"); United States\nv. Carrillo-Figueroa, 34 F.3d 33, 42-43 (1st Cir. 1994) (record\nsupports § 3A1.2 enhancement because defendant saw that the\n\"vehicle that [the officer] was driving exhibited characteristics\nidentifying it as an official vehicle);          United States v.\nZaragoza-Fernández, 217 F.3d 31, 32-33 (1st Cir. 2000) (record\nsupports § 3A1.2 enhancement because of \"abundant evidence that\ndefendant saw [the officer] in front of his car [and] had reason to\nappreciate that he was a law enforcement officer\").\n     11\n      As explained, Cirilo-Muñoz did not engage in any of the\nconversations regarding Lugo's suspicion of Mejías as an officer --\nCirilo-Muñoz was not present when Lugo accused Mejías of being an\nofficer, he was not present when Lugo called Ramírez, he was not\nbrought to the stoop to discuss Mejías, and he was not present when\nMejías was abducted.    We found no evidence that Lugo ever told\nCirilo-Muñoz of his suspicion of Mejías's status, much less of his\n\n                               -20-\n\fdistrict judge's reasoning and obstinate conclusion has provided an\n\nimplicit roadmap for the same judge to reimpose a similarly harsh\n\nsentence, thus possibly making this remand an exercise in futility.\n\n           In fact, there is little said in the majority opinion, or\n\nfor that matter, in this concurrence, that the trial judge, who\n\nheard the flimsy evidence against appellant, was not aware of when\n\nhe sentenced appellant.       Furthermore, from the transcript of the\n\nsentencing hearing, a small flavor of which is reproduced in the\n\nmajority opinion, maj. op. at 7, it is apparent that this judge was\n\nnot greatly interested in hearing the argument of counsel.12                This\n\ntone is reproduced again when we see the short shrift given by the\n\nsame judge to appellant's § 2255 petition, in which he found\n\nwithout   much   ado   not   only   that    he   had   properly   applied   the\n\nenhancement based on appellant's knowledge of the victim's status\n\n\n\nintent to kill Mejías. This is supported by the fact that even\nMangual, the driver, was shocked when Lugo shot Mejías, by Lugo's\ninitial decision to let Mejías drive away, and by Cirilo-Muñoz's\nrefusal to \"beat up\" Mejías. We also found no evidence to support\nany inference that Cirilo-Muñoz suspected Mejías's status prior to\nthe murder, especially given that Mejías often acted outside his\nofficial duties. Evidence at trial shows that Mejías purchased\ncrack and gave it to a prostitute, he regularly ordered a flask\nfilled with rum, he drank and played pool with Cirilo-Muñoz and\nothers, and he brandished a gun during a serious confrontation with\na debtor. Even Lugo began to have doubts about Mejías's status.\nAs the majority recognizes, \"if Lugo's expressed concern was that\nMejías was an informant (and not that he was an officer), it is\nunclear why the district judge thought that Cirilo-Muñoz knew or\nbelieved Mejías was a police officer.\" Maj. op. at 9.\n     12\n      As counsel was about to argue Cirilo-Muñoz's lack of\nknowledge, the judge interrupted and stated: \"[c]ounsel, that's\nwhat the jury decided. I'm not going to get into that.\"\n\n                                     -21-\n\fas an officer -- of which there is not a shred of evidence anywhere\n\non the record -- but also that defense counsel's failure to raise\n\nthis issue on appeal did not violate Cirilo-Muñoz's constitutional\n\nrights.\n\n              In my opinion, these recurrent conclusions by the trial\n\njudge      are     not    only   legally     erroneous,        which    the   majority\n\nrecognizes, but also demonstrate an obstinate predisposition to\n\nreach a set conclusion in this case. Resentencing should therefore\n\ntake place before a different judge.                 See, e.g., United States v.\n\nMuñiz, 49 F.3d 36, 41 (1st Cir. 1995) (remanding for resentencing\n\nby a different judge where, inter alia, the original judge based\n\nhis sentence on unsupported factfindings); Mawson v. United States,\n\n463 F.2d 29, 31 (1st Cir. 1972) (\"It is difficult for a judge,\n\nhaving once made up his mind, to resentence a defendant, and both\n\nfor the judge's sake, and the appearance of justice, we remand this\n\ncase    to    be     redrawn.\").       I    simply    see   no    reason      why   this\n\n\"reassignment would entail waste and duplication out of proportion\n\nto   any     gain    in   preserving       the    appearance     of    fairness.\"    See\n\nMaldonado Santiago v. Velázquez García, 821 F.2d 811, 832-33 (1st\n\nCir. 1987).         See also United States v. Hanono-Surujun, 914 F.2d 15\n\n(1st Cir. 1990) (remanding to a different judge where a rule has\n\nnot been fully complied with and there has been a sharp upwards\n\ndeparture from the Guidelines).\n\n\n\n\n                                           -22-\n\f           Even stretching it to the breaking point, Cirilo-Muñoz's\n\n\"participation\" and his knowledge of events was minimal and paled\n\nwhen compared to the actions of Lugo -- who not only was the leader\n\nand principal culprit, even if the government gave him a sweetheart\n\ndeal -- but he was the cold-hearted killer of Officer Mejías.     Yet\n\nCirilo-Muñoz received a sentence of life imprisonment as compared\n\nwith the twenty years imposed upon Lugo.      This, after the district\n\njudge's \"possible misperception[s]\" led him to make \"a formal\n\nfinding that the victim was a police officer when he assisted in\n\nthe venture.     But there is no detailed discussion of the evidence\n\non which such a finding might rest.\"      Maj. op. at 8. Of course,\n\nthere is no evidence in the record that Cirilo-Muñoz possessed the\n\nrequisite knowledge that the district judge attributed to him,\n\nunless he acquired it by extra sensory perception, or that he\n\n\"assisted in the venture,\"13 unless this term has acquired a new\n\nmeaning.\n\n           This is a case which started out on the wrong foot.\n\nUnfortunately it appears destined to continue to suffer permanently\n\nfrom this handicap. \"Nothing is more damaging to a new truth than\n\nan old error.\"    Goethe, Spruche in Prosa.\n\n\n\n\n     13\n      The evidence highlighted by the majority -- appellant's\npresence in the cemetery when Ramírez shot Mejías in the head, who\nwas presumably already dead, as well as appellant receiving\nMejías's money and driving Lugo home -- would make Cirilo-Muñoz an\naccessory after the fact, 18 U.S.C. § 3, not an aider and abetter.\n\n                                 -23-\n\f",

Jose Lugo-Sanchez\n\n(“Lugo”), Saul Mangual-Corchado (“Mangual”) and David Silva worked\n\nregular shifts selling drugs outside Cafetín El Ideal–-a retail\n\nshop where customers could also drink and play pool--in Trujillo\n\nAlto, Puerto Rico.     Cirilo also frequented El Ideal and was said\n\n(by El Ideal’s owner) to be “almost always” with Mangual and Lugo,\n\nalthough there was no evidence that he sold drugs.\n\n             Lugo correctly suspected that one drug customer–-Agent\n\nIvan Mejias-Hernandez (“Mejias”)–-was in fact an undercover police\n\nofficer.   In October 1994, one of Lugo’s suppliers ordered Lugo to\n\nkill Mejias, and Lugo in turn told Luis Antonio Ramirez-Ynoa\n\n(“Ramirez”) of his plan.    On November 1, 1994, Mejias arrived at El\n\nIdeal between 10:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. driving a white Suzuki.            At\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\faround 11:15 a.m., Lugo called Ramirez on the phone from El Ideal,\n\ntelling him to drive to El Ideal and to bring “the revolver.”1\n\nRamirez arrived by 12:30 p.m. with a black Oldsmobile and a\n\nrevolver.\n\n            Ten to fifteen minutes later, Cirilo arrived at El Ideal\n\nand was greeted by Lugo.          Shortly thereafter, Lugo and Mejias\n\nwalked to the stoop of a nearby building, where Lugo accused Mejias\n\nof being an informant.     Silva and Ramirez arrived at the stoop, and\n\nLugo walked back toward El Ideal, retrieving the revolver from the\n\nOldsmobile and concealing it.       Walking back toward El Ideal again,\n\nLugo encountered Cirilo, Mangual and one Yito Morales, and tried\n\nunsuccessfully to incite them to “beat up” Mejias.\n\n            Then   Lugo,   with   several   others   (possibly    including\n\nCirilo), returned to the stoop.           There Lugo ordered Mejias at\n\ngunpoint to turn over the keys to the Suzuki.         Ramirez and Mangual\n\nthen searched the Suzuki and retrieved Mejias’ gun.              Cirilo was\n\nstanding “real close to the car but not searching,” just “looking”;\n\nhis fingerprints were found on the Suzuki, although no evidence was\n\npresented as to when he touched the car.\n\n            Mejias, escorted by Lugo, then returned to the Suzuki\n\nfrom the stoop and retrieved his keys.        Lugo told him to get into\n\nthe car and “not to come around there anymore.”        However, as Mejias\n\n\n\n     1\n      Quotes such as these throughout this decision are taken from\nthe trial transcript.\n\n                                    -3-\n\fwas about to leave, another man called “Papilin” told Lugo, “You\n\nhave to take him or kill him because he might come back.”      There\n\nwas no direct evidence that Cirilo heard this exchange, and the\n\nevidence was unclear as to where Cirilo was standing (or where\n\nPapilin and Lugo were standing) when this command was given.\n\n            Lugo then ordered Mejias into the Suzuki, and Mangual\n\ndrove the Suzuki onto the highway with Mejias and Lugo in the back\n\nseat.    Shortly thereafter, Lugo shot Mejias in the abdomen and in\n\nthe head.    Cirilo and Ramirez followed in the Oldsmobile, with\n\nCirilo driving, although there was no evidence as to why.      Lugo\n\nlater testified that he had not told Cirilo about the planned\n\nmurder and that he (Lugo) had not asked that Cirilo follow.2\n\n            The cars stopped at a cemetery. Whether Mejias was still\n\nalive is unclear but in any event Ramirez shot Mejias twice more in\n\nthe head.    The men then drove in the two cars to a quarry (during\n\nthe drive Cirilo ingested cocaine provided by Lugo); the Suzuki\n\n(with Mejias’ body in it) was pushed into the quarry.   The men then\n\nleft the quarry in the Oldsmobile driven by Cirilo.   Lugo split the\n\n$240 he had taken from Mejias’ wallet with the others.       Cirilo\n\nfinally drove Lugo home.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      It should be noted that Lugo had also told two different and\nlater-recanted versions of events to the FBI before trial, at least\none of which incriminated Cirilo. Given Cirilo’s conviction, it is\nuncertain whether the jury credited Lugo’s exculpatory statement at\ntrial.\n\n                                 -4-\n\f           Mangual, Ramirez, Lugo and Cirilo were apprehended and,\n\nin September 1995, Cirilo was convicted after a jury trial in\n\nfederal court of aiding and abetting the murder of an on-duty law-\n\nenforcement officer during the commission of a drug offense, 21\n\nU.S.C. § 848(e)(1)(B) (2000); 18 U.S.C. § 2 (2000).         On appeal,\n\nCirilo argued that the evidence was insufficient to establish the\n\naiding and abetting offense but, with one judge dissenting on this\n\nissue, the conviction was affirmed.      Mangual, 139 F.3d at 44-49;\n\nid. at 49-56 (McAuliffe, J., dissenting in part).\n\n           At sentencing in January 1996, the district judge found\n\nthat Mejias’ killing was motivated by his status as a police\n\nofficer,   resulting   in   a   three-level   enhancement   under   the\n\nsentencing guidelines, U.S.S.G. § 3A1.2(a).      This raised Cirilo’s\n\nsentencing range from about 27 to 34 years, to required life\n\nimprisonment. At sentencing Cirilo’s trial counsel objected to the\n\nenhancement, arguing that the government had not shown that Cirilo\n\nknew that Mejias was a police officer.    The issue was not raised on\n\nappeal.\n\n           On September 29, 1999, Cirilo filed a petition for post-\n\nconviction relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 (2000),3 attacking his\n\nsentence in various respects.        The district court denied the\n\n\n     3\n      Under section 2255, a federal court that imposed a sentence\nmay vacate or correct it if “the sentence was imposed in violation\nof the Constitution or laws of the United States . . . or . . . the\nsentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law, or is\notherwise subject to collateral attack.”\n\n                                  -5-\n\fpetition, concluding inter alia that the court at sentencing had\n\ncorrectly applied the enhancement and that the lawyer’s failure to\n\nraise the issue on appeal did not violate Cirilo’s constitutional\n\nrights.

We believe that test is\n\nmet in this instance: the enhancement, which had a dramatic effect\n\n\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fon the sentence, rested on very thin evidence and a possible\n\nmisinterpretation of the jury verdict by the district court.\n\n            During the sentencing hearing, the judge asked (and was\n\nanswered in the affirmative), “Didn’t the jury find that this\n\nvictim was killed . . . because he was a police officer?”             Later\n\n(during a discussion of a minor-participant adjustment), Cirilo’s\n\nlawyer   suggested    that   even   though   Cirilo   followed   in     the\n\nOldsmobile, “that doesn’t mean that [Cirilo] knew that [Lugo] was\n\ngoing to kill and that [Mejias] was a police officer.       He may have\n\nbeen surprised when--”.      The court responded “that’s what the jury\n\ndecided.”\n\n            If the district judge was referring to knowledge of\n\nMejias’ status, this is not what the jury had decided; the court’s\n\ninstructions to the jury stated that “[k]nowledge of the victim’s\n\nstatus as a law enforcement officer is not necessarily an element\n\nof the offense.”      Although the jury was instructed that Cirilo\n\nneeded to know that murder was intended, the jury was not required\n\nby the instruction to find that Cirilo knew that the victim was a\n\npolice officer.4     The distinction between levels of knowledge is a\n\nfine one but it mattered to the particular enhancement.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      Whether 21 U.S.C. § 848(e)(1)(B) itself or its aiding-and-\nabetting variant require knowledge of the victim’s status as a\npolice officer is not clearly addressed by circuit case law, but\nthe jury instructions in this case said that such knowledge was not\nnecessarily required.\n\n                                    -7-\n\f          Whether this possible misperception affected the district\n\njudge’s ruling is unclear. In the sentencing hearing, the district\n\njudge did make a formal finding that Cirilo knew that the victim\n\nwas a police officer when he (Cirilo) assisted in the venture.   But\n\nthere was no detailed discussion by the district judge of the\n\nevidence on which such a finding might rest.     Ordinarily it is\n\nenough that sufficient evidence exist, but in this instance the\n\nevidence is thin and the basis for the inference drawn by the\n\ndistrict judge is not apparent to us.\n\n          The conviction itself rested on fairly limited evidence\n\nof scienter, but an inference that Cirilo was involved in the plot\n\ncould be drawn from Cirilo’s presence at the scene of incitement\n\nand threat, his prints on the car, his otherwise unexplained\n\npursuit of the Suzuki with a party to the plot, his presence when\n\nthe victim was shot again and his sharing of the proceeds.   Other\n\ncontextual clues were the other perpetrators’ willing acceptance of\n\nCirilo’s presence during the events leading up to Mejias’ death,\n\nand evidence of Cirilo’s indebtedness to Lugo’s supplier which may\n\nhave given Cirilo a motive to assist.\n\n          It is much harder, on what we can find in this record and\n\nwithout more explanation, to see why Cirilo should be taken to have\n\nknown that the intended victim was a police officer.5     Cirilo’s\n\n\n     5\n      The guideline, unlike the statute, explicitly requires that\nCirilo’s offense have been “motivated by” Mejias’ status as an\nofficer.    U.S.S.G. § 3A1.2(a).    This ordinarily would entail\n\n                               -8-\n\fconduct and continued presence may be difficult to explain if he\n\nwere not aware that Mejias would be killed; the panel that affirmed\n\nthe conviction so reasoned.    But even with this awareness, Cirilo\n\nmight have thought that Mejias was an informant or a member of a\n\nrival drug supply organization; or Cirilo might have assisted his\n\nassociates’ efforts to kill a man without knowing just why they\n\nwere doing it.   Had any of these been Cirilo’s motivation, the\n\nenhancement would not apply.\n\n          Although Lugo at one point testified that he suspected\n\nMejias of being “a police officer,” he also testified that he had\n\nconfronted Mejias and told him that “as far as I was concerned he\n\nwas a police informant” and “a snitch,” and that he told Silva to\n\nfind out if Mejias was really “a police informant or what.”\n\nParticularly if Lugo’s expressed concern was that Mejias was an\n\ninformant (and not that he was an officer), it is unclear why the\n\ndistrict judge thought that Cirilo knew or believed Mejias was a\n\npolice officer and thus that his assistance in the murder was\n\nmotivated by Mejias’ official status.\n\n          The government says that the omission of the enhancement\n\nissue on direct appeal was simply a “tactical judgment.” Murchu v.\n\n\n\nknowledge or belief that the victim is an officer, see, e.g.,\nUnited States v.

Yet the argument\n\nwould not have detracted from the evidentiary challenge to the\n\nconviction but would have built upon it.           It had the further\n\nadvantage of focusing on the district court’s arguable conflation\n\nof the two different scienter issues.         And it represented the\n\ndifference between a long jail sentence and a life sentence.        One\n\nwould need a potent reason for omitting the enhancement argument\n\nfrom the direct appeal.\n\n          Assuming   that   the    omission   of   the   argument   was\n\ndeliberate, the best one can say for counsel is this: that in some\n\nsituations lawyers think--usually in error--that by omitting a good\n\nargument, they can thereby increase the chance of prevailing on a\n\nmore doubtful argument directed to a more far-reaching result.\n\nHowever, in this instance, such a calculation would have been\n\nmanifestly unreasonable under an objective standard, given the\n\ncomparative strengths of the two different attacks, the opportunity\n\nto make both, and the stakes for the defendant.\n\n          The second stage of the Strickland inquiry requires a\n\n“reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional\n\nerrors, the result . . . would have been different.”          Epsom v.\n\nHall, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"782080\"><a href=\"/opinion/782080/albert-epsom-v-timothy-hall/\"><span class=\"volume\">330</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 53 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S.\n\nat 694) (omission in original).

The   government   has   already   had   its\n\nopportunity on this appeal to defend the enhancement, and we\n\nalready know that our own disposition of the direct appeal would\n\nhave been to remand for re-sentencing.         We therefore do so now.\n\n           We have had to make our assessment of the constitutional\n\nclaim based on our own unaided review of the record and without any\n\nclear understanding of the district judge’s reasoning in finding\n\nthat Cirilo knew in advance of the crime that the victim was a\n\npolice officer.   Conceivably, on re-sentencing, the government may\n\nagain urge that such knowledge existed.         Without foreclosing such\n\nan argument by the government, we are highly skeptical that such a\n\npremise can be established or that a life sentence can be justified\n\non the known facts.\n\n           Cirilo’s brief may be taken to raise a separate claim\n\nunder section 2255 that his sentence should be vacated because the\n\nenhancement was supported by inadequate evidence.            This issue--\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\funlike the ineffective assistance claim covered by the certificate\n\nof appealability and the Sixth Amendment claim that we later\n\nexpressly permitted Cirilo to pursue–-is not properly before us as\n\nan independent claim.     Further, the use of section 2255 to attack\n\nsentencing findings is, if permissible, at best limited to very\n\nunusual cases.    It also is likely that on remand the issue will\n\ndisappear from the court.\n\n            As part of his section 2255 petition, Cirilo filed a\n\nsupplemental brief seeking additional review of his sentencing in\n\nlight of the Supreme Court’s decision in Blakely v.

We have already\n\ndecided that Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 430, which provides jury trials\n\nfor increasing statutory maximums, would not apply retroactively.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\fSee Sepulveda, 330 F.3d at 61-63.           This resolves any comparable\n\nBlakely-like claim in this circuit.\n\n            As for the application of mandatory rather than advisory\n\nguidelines, it is unclear that advisory guidelines will alter a\n\ngreat number of sentences; mandatory minimums imposed by statute\n\nare another question altogether.         The guidelines remain a central\n\nconsideration in sentencing; and sentencing courts must still\n\nconsider the same statutory factors that the Sentencing Commission\n\nwas required to use in promulgating the guidelines.               See 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3553(a) (2000); 28 U.S.C. § 994(m) (2000).           To describe the use\n\nof   mandatory   guidelines     as   generating    serious       inaccuracy   or\n\nfundamental unfairness would not be easy.\n\n            Realistically, it is unlikely that the Supreme Court will\n\nadopt   a   retroactivity     analysis      that   opens    up    to   required\n\nreexamination practically all of the federal sentences imposed\n\nsince the guidelines went into effect in 1987. This would comprise\n\ntens of     thousands   of   sentences   imposed    under    a    regime   whose\n\nlawfulness was assumed during most of this period.               If such a vast\n\nreopening of final judgments is required, it must await a decision\n\nof the Supreme Court.        Certainly Booker itself does not give any\n\nclear hint that retroactive effect is intended.\n\n            Every other circuit that has considered this issue has\n\nagreed that Booker does not apply retroactively.

This is the dissenting judge's view on direct\n\nappeal regarding the sufficiency of evidence on the aiding and\n\nabetting charge, a matter which we are presently foreclosed from\n\nrevisiting on the merits. Nevertheless, the facts surrounding this\n\nconclusion are not irrelevant to the issues before us.       This is\n\nparticularly so in light of the majority's recognition, especially\n\nin its discussion of appellant's claim of ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel,   of   the     \"thinness\"   of   the   evidence   supporting\n\nCirilo-Muñoz's knowledge that the victim was a police officer. See\n\nmaj. op. at 7, 8, 10.\n\n           I write separately in part because I have considerable\n\ndisagreement with the majority's glossing of the events as they\n\nunfolded prior to the police officer's murder by Lugo. Although my\n\nview of the relevant facts might, at first glance, appear to bog\n\ndown on minor details, those facts are significant precisely\n\nbecause of the \"thinness\" of the case against Cirilo-Muñoz, and\n\nbecause that \"thinness\" is on a broader scale than my colleagues in\n\nthe majority acknowledge.\n\n                                 -16-\n\f            First, there is no evidence that Cirilo-Muñoz was present\n\nat \"El Ideal\" on the day in question as part of Lugo's drug-selling\n\ngang.    Cirilo-Muñoz lived only five minutes' walking distance from\n\nthis neighborhood hangout, which he regularly frequented to listen\n\nto music, play pool and talk to other youths.   There is no evidence\n\nthat he sold drugs, although the record does show that he was a\n\ndrug user.      Second, there is no evidence that Cirilo-Muñoz's\n\npresence at \"El Ideal\" on November 1, 1994, was at the behest of\n\nLugo or of anyone in his gang.    When he arrived, Lugo was already\n\nthere, and the evidence is uncontradicted that Cirilo-Muñoz was\n\nunaware of the reason for Lugo's presence and his intent to harm\n\nthe undercover police officer, Mejías.      In fact, the record is\n\nclear that later, when Lugo tried to incite several of those\n\npresent to \"beat up\" Mejías, appellant flat out refused to do so.8\n\nFurthermore, there is no evidence, and no valid inference can be\n\nmade from the record, that Cirilo-Muñoz was on the stoop at any\n\ntime on November 1st when Lugo and his cohorts were accosting Agent\n\nMejías.    The majority's statement to the effect that Cirilo-Muñoz\n\n\"possibly\" was on the stoop, maj. op. at 3, is pure speculation.\n\nIn fact, the evidence is to the effect that Cirilo-Muñoz did not\n\nexit \"El Ideal\" until after Ramírez and Mangual came out of the\n\nstoop to search Mejías's car for the agent's gun. Cirilo-Muñoz did\n\n     8\n      It would seem that if Cirilo-Muñoz was disinclined to \"rough\"\nMejías up, he would even be less agreeable to aid in his murder, a\nfact that, as I will further discuss, is borne out by Lugo's\nexculpatory evidence.\n\n                                 -17-\n\fnot    participate   in    the   search   and   \"was   just   looking.\"   The\n\nfingerprints found on Mejías's car matching Cirilo-Muñoz supports\n\nthis account, as they were all lifted from the exterior portions of\n\nthe car.   No evidence exists as to when they were imprinted there.\n\n            It is with regard to the evidence surrounding the murder\n\nof Agent Mejías that I find the majority's statement of the facts\n\nmost problematic because I believe it unfairly places an aura of\n\nknowledge of the events to follow on appellant.           This implication\n\nof knowledge is unsupported by the \"thin\" record, so \"thin\" that\n\nthe government, who is the one properly called upon to meet this\n\nburden under our system of justice, has verily skated through the\n\nice.\n\n            In this regard, the majority states that \"[t]here was no\n\ndirect evidence that Cirilo-[Muñoz]\" heard the exchange between\n\nLugo and \"Papilín\" in which \"Papilín\" told Lugo to \"take or kill\"\n\nMejías, and that \"the evidence was unclear as to where Cirilo-\n\n[Muñoz] was standing (or where Papilín and Lugo were standing) when\n\nthis command was given.\" Maj. op. at 4.          If that is so -- i.e., if\n\nthe evidence is not direct and is unclear -- what should follow,\n\nconsidering that this is a criminal case in which the unstated\n\npremise of these statements carries serious consequences for the\n\nappellant, is a statement by the majority to the effect that no\n\ninference of knowledge regarding this conversation may be imputed\n\nupon Cirilo-Muñoz.        But no such disclaimer is made.       Instead, we\n\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\fare left with the worst kind of imputation, a half-inference, a\n\nlingering doubt as to what appellant has to answer for, and a vague\n\nquestion mark as to what weight is actually being given by the\n\ncourt to this non-evidence.\n\n                This rustling of soft \"evidence\" is followed by the\n\nmajority's        downgrading    of    the   only   direct   evidence   presented\n\nregarding Cirilo-Muñoz's lack of knowledge of Mejías's fate. See\n\nMaj. op. at 4, n.3.        Lugo, the person who actually murdered Mejías,\n\nand who took the stand as a government witness, testified that\n\nafter he shot Mejías upon leaving \"El Ideal\" in a car with Mangual,\n\nhe observed that Cirilo-Muñoz and Ramírez were following them in\n\nanother car. Lugo testified that he had not asked Cirilo-Muñoz and\n\nRamírez to follow them.          In fact, Lugo testified that Cirilo-Muñoz\n\nonly knew about beating Mejías, but that at that time \"didn't know\n\nthat he was going to be killed.\"9             Although the majority points to\n\nLugo's earlier statement to the F.B.I. that incriminated appellant,\n\nthis statement was made when Lugo was looking to make a deal for\n\nhimself with the government.            By the time of trial, however,         Lugo\n\nno longer had anything to gain by wrongly implicating Cirilo-Muñoz.\n\n                In light of the full factual background of this appeal,\n\nI   am       concerned   about   the   majority's     decision   to   remand    for\n\nresentencing to the same judge who sentenced appellant originally\n\n         9\n      Even Mangual, the driver of the Oldsmobile carrying Lugo and\nAgent Mejías, was shocked and lost control of the car when Lugo\nfirst shot Mejías. Mangual asked \"What did you do?,\" to which Lugo\nresponded \"Keep driving or you're next.\"\n\n                                         -19-\n\fand who also decided his § 2255 petition.   This judge had two bites\n\nat the apple to do so, and in each instance insisted that the\n\n\"whole picture\" supports Cirilo-Muñoz's enhancement.10   Yet our own\n\nexamination of the entire trial transcript failed to produce any\n\nevidence establishing Cirilo-Muñoz's knowledge of the victim's\n\nstatus as an officer.11   The majority's failure to address the\n\n     10\n      The district judge stated that he looked at the \"whole\npicture\" to infer that the \"defendant knew that the victim was a\npolice officer and [that] he was being killed because he was a\npolice officer.\"    As evidentiary support, the judge cited the\nfollowing: (1) Cirilo-Muñoz's arrival 10-15 minutes after Ramírez's\narrival; (2) the proximity between the stoop and El Ideal; (3)\nLugo's solicitation of Cirilo-Muñoz and others to \"beat up\" Mejías;\n(4) Cirilo-Muñoz getting into the car with Ramírez; (5) the\ninference that Cirilo-Muñoz and Ramírez must have heard the two\nshots from the Oldsmobile; and (6) Cirilo-Muñoz following in the\ncar, sharing in the money, and driving Lugo home. However, even if\nwe take all these facts in the light most favorable to the court's\ninterpretation, the aggregate fails to establish Cirilo-Muñoz's\nknowledge of Mejías's status as an officer. The proffered evidence\nalso falls significantly short of instances where we have found\nsuch \"reasonable belief\" of the victim's status to support the\nenhancement. See United States v.

We found no evidence that Lugo ever told\nCirilo-Muñoz of his suspicion of Mejías's status, much less of his\n\n                               -20-\n\fdistrict judge's reasoning and obstinate conclusion has provided an\n\nimplicit roadmap for the same judge to reimpose a similarly harsh\n\nsentence, thus possibly making this remand an exercise in futility.\n\n           In fact, there is little said in the majority opinion, or\n\nfor that matter, in this concurrence, that the trial judge, who\n\nheard the flimsy evidence against appellant, was not aware of when\n\nhe sentenced appellant.       Furthermore, from the transcript of the\n\nsentencing hearing, a small flavor of which is reproduced in the\n\nmajority opinion, maj. op. at 7, it is apparent that this judge was\n\nnot greatly interested in hearing the argument of counsel.12                This\n\ntone is reproduced again when we see the short shrift given by the\n\nsame judge to appellant's § 2255 petition, in which he found\n\nwithout   much   ado   not   only   that    he   had   properly   applied   the\n\nenhancement based on appellant's knowledge of the victim's status\n\n\n\nintent to kill Mejías. This is supported by the fact that even\nMangual, the driver, was shocked when Lugo shot Mejías, by Lugo's\ninitial decision to let Mejías drive away, and by Cirilo-Muñoz's\nrefusal to \"beat up\" Mejías. We also found no evidence to support\nany inference that Cirilo-Muñoz suspected Mejías's status prior to\nthe murder, especially given that Mejías often acted outside his\nofficial duties. Evidence at trial shows that Mejías purchased\ncrack and gave it to a prostitute, he regularly ordered a flask\nfilled with rum, he drank and played pool with Cirilo-Muñoz and\nothers, and he brandished a gun during a serious confrontation with\na debtor. Even Lugo began to have doubts about Mejías's status.\nAs the majority recognizes, \"if Lugo's expressed concern was that\nMejías was an informant (and not that he was an officer), it is\nunclear why the district judge thought that Cirilo-Muñoz knew or\nbelieved Mejías was a police officer.\" Maj. op. at 9.\n     12\n      As counsel was about to argue Cirilo-Muñoz's lack of\nknowledge, the judge interrupted and stated: \"[c]ounsel, that's\nwhat the jury decided. I'm not going to get into that.\"\n\n                                     -21-\n\fas an officer -- of which there is not a shred of evidence anywhere\n\non the record -- but also that defense counsel's failure to raise\n\nthis issue on appeal did not violate Cirilo-Muñoz's constitutional\n\nrights.\n\n              In my opinion, these recurrent conclusions by the trial\n\njudge      are     not    only   legally     erroneous,        which    the   majority\n\nrecognizes, but also demonstrate an obstinate predisposition to\n\nreach a set conclusion in this case.
