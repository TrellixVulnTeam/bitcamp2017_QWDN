TEMPELMAN; PRISCILLA TEMPELMAN,\n\n                        Defendants, Appellants.\n\n\n          APPEALS FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                   FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n          [Hon. Paul J. Barbadoro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                        Selya, Lynch and Lipez,\n                            Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Andrew D. Tempelman and Priscilla Tempelman on brief pro se.\n     Eileen J. O'Connor, Assistant Attorney General, Thomas J.\nClark and Patricia M. Bowman, Attorneys, Department of Justice, and\nThomas P. Colantuono, United States Attorney, on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                           October 10, 2002\n\f              Per Curiam. Last year, this court affirmed a pair of\n\n  rulings in which the district court (1) concluded that the\n\n  appellant taxpayers owed substantial amounts in unpaid federal\n\n  income taxes and (2) authorized a foreclosure sale of their\n\n  property.    See United States v. Tempelman, 12 Fed. Appx. 18,\n\n  2001 WL 725370 (1st Cir. 2001) (per curiam), cert. denied, 122\n\n  S. Ct. 842 (2002).   The property has since been sold at public\n\n  auction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2001(a).        In the instant\n\n  appeals, the taxpayers now challenge a trio of orders in which\n\n  the district court (1) confirmed the sale, (2) authorized the\n\n  disbursement of the proceeds, and (3) denied their request for\n\n  \"equitable redemption.\"     We affirm.1\n\n              None of the taxpayers' several assignments of error\n\n  requires extended discussion.      \"It is well established that\n\n  confirmation of a judicial sale rests in the sound discretion\n\n  of the district court and will not be disturbed on appeal\n\n  except for abuse.\"     United States v. Peters, 777 F.2d 1294,\n\n  1298 n.6 (7th Cir. 1985).   Such sales \"enjoy a certain favor in\n\n  the law\" and will not be overturned \"[i]n the absence of\n\n\n     1\n        The government has suggested that, because the sale has\noccurred and the proceeds disbursed, one or both of the appeals are\nmoot. Yet in contrast to cases such as Oakville Dev. Corp. v.\nF.D.I.C., 986 F.2d 611 (1st Cir. 1993), and Holloway v. United\nStates, 789 F.2d 1372 (9th Cir. 1986), the relief sought by the\ntaxpayers here includes more than just a request to prevent or\noverturn the sale. Their challenge to the district court's refusal\nto recognize a right of redemption, for example, presents an\nongoing controversy.\n\n                                  -2-\n\fsubstantial grounds.\"         Schwartz v. J.R. Cianchette & Sons\n\nCorp., 362 F.2d 500, 505 (1st Cir. 1966); accord, e.g., M.R.R.\n\nTraders, Inc. v. Cave Atlantique, Inc., 788 F.2d 816, 818 (1st\n\nCir. 1986).     No \"substantial grounds\" have been cited here.\n\nThe taxpayers advance various objections to the manner in which\n\nthe sale was conducted. Yet their complaints, in turn, involve\n\nevents   that   were    necessitated    by   their     own    conduct   (the\n\nrelocated auction site), or that operated to their benefit (the\n\nrevised property tax arrangement), or that were trivial (the\n\ntiming of the notices; the mistaken listing of the property's\n\naddress; the involvement of government counsel at the auction).\n\nFurthermore, the government disclosed all such matters to the\n\ndistrict   court   in   its   motion    to   confirm    the    sale.    The\n\ntaxpayers filed their opposition to that motion three days\n\nafter a court-imposed deadline (and two days after the court's\n\nruling).   And neither in that opposition nor on appeal have\n\nthey made a colorable showing of prejudice.                    Under these\n\ncircumstances, it cannot be said that the court abused its\n\ndiscretion in confirming the sale.\n\n           We likewise perceive no error in the denial of the\n\nmotion for equitable redemption.        As the taxpayers concede, 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2001(a) confers no redemption rights.               Their reliance\n\non 26 U.S.C. § 6337(b), which applies to property sold under a\n\nlevy and distraint proceeding, is misplaced. See, e.g., United\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fStates v. Heasley, 283 F.2d 422, 427 (8th Cir. 1960); cf. United\n\nStates v. Rodgers, 461 U.S. 677, 695-700 (1983) (explaining\n\ndistinction between administrative levy and judicial forfeiture\n\nproceedings).   Even if state law redemption rights could be\n\ninvoked in this context--a proposition we need not decide--the\n\ntiming of the taxpayers' motion would render the relevant New\n\nHampshire statute inapplicable.     See N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. §\n\n80:69 (permitting redemption \"at any time before a deed ... is\n\ngiven by the collector\").   And the taxpayers' lack of \"clean\n\nhands\"--as evidenced, inter alia, by their unauthorized refusal\n\nto vacate the premises as ordered--suffices to reject their\n\nappeal to general principles of equity.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -4-\n\f",
