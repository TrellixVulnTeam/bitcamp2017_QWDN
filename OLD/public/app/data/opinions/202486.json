This insurance coverage case arises\n\nout   of   the   following    events.      In   fall   2000,   the   Town   of\n\nProvincetown, Massachusetts (\"Provincetown\"), contracted with AGM\n\nMarine Contractors (\"AGM\") to reconstruct MacMillan Pier on the\n\nProvincetown waterfront and to procure and install a concrete\n\nfloating dock system.          Under AGM's superintendence, Southeast\n\nFloating Docks (\"Southeast\") agreed to provide floating docks for\n\nMacMillan Pier.    Installation of the new dock system was completed\n\nin June 2003.\n\n            There were two main floating docks (A and B) extending\n\noutward from MacMillan Pier.            These main docks floated on the\n\nsurface of the water but stayed in position next to MacMillan Pier\n\nbecause piles, planted in the ground below the water's surface, ran\n\nthough u-brackets on the sides of the floating docks.            A number of\n\nsmaller \"finger\" floating docks extended from the main floating\n\ndocks and were held in place by connections to the main docks.\n\n            A strong winter storm occurred during December 5-7, 2003.\n\nSome of the floating docks broke loose; some sank; and most were\n\nirreparably damaged.         Immediately after the storm, Provincetown\n\ndirected AGM to retrieve the docks, which it did.              AGM was later\n\nrequired by the town to provide replacement docks.              AGM incurred\n\nsignificant costs which it sought to recover from both insurance\n\nand from Southeast (which it accused of having failed to follow\n\nspecifications in building the docks).\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f            In March 2004, AGM notified American Home Assurance\n\nCompany (\"American Home\") of a claim under the commercial marine\n\nliability policy that American Home had issued to AGM, providing\n\ncoverage from January 1, 2003 to January 1, 2004 (\"the policy\").\n\nThe policy is based on the standard Commercial General Liability\n\nCoverage (\"CGL\") form written by the Insurance Services Office\n\n(\"ISO\"), an organization of insurance companies that prepares\n\nstandard form contracts, among other things.\n\n            American Home denied AGM's claim for coverage and on June\n\n17, 2004, filed a petition for declaratory judgment in the federal\n\ndistrict    court    in   Massachusetts     to   establish   that   it    had   no\n\nliability    under    the   policy.       AGM    counterclaimed     and   sought\n\nrecovery for the cost of recovering the docks, loss of use of the\n\ndocks and for repairing damage to the docks or replacing them.\n\nBoth sides moved for summary judgment.\n\n            On July 25, 2005, the district court granted summary\n\njudgment in favor of American Home, concluding that the policy did\n\nnot cover the losses for which AGM sought recovery.             American Home\n\nAssurance Co. v. AGM Marine Contractors, Inc., 379 F. Supp. 2d 134,\n\n135 (D. Mass. 2005).        Less than six months later, an arbitrator\n\ngranted AGM recovery against Southeast for $389,703, concluding\n\nthat Southeast had failed to follow specifications in designing the\n\ndocks.   Southeast is currently contesting the arbitration award.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\f           AGM   now   appeals   from   the   district      court's    decision\n\ndenying insurance coverage. Review on summary judgment is de novo,\n\ndrawing inferences in favor of the non-moving party.                  Nicolo v.\n\nPhillip Morris, Inc., 201 F.3d 29, 33 (1st Cir. 2000).                Where, as\n\nis the case here, cross-motions are involved, the court applies\n\nthis standard to each motion separately.          Reich v. John Alden Life\n\nIns. Co., 126 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n           Although the case is within the admiralty jurisdiction of\n\nthe federal courts because the contract was \"maritime in nature,\"\n\nAcadia Ins. Co. v. McNeil, 116 F.3d 599, 601, 603 (1st Cir. 1997),\n\nwe look to state law (in this case Massachusetts), given the\n\nabsence of a federal statute or a federal judicially created rule\n\ngoverning such contracts. Littlefield v. Acadia Ins. Co., 392 F.3d\n\n1, 6-7 (1st Cir. 2004).     Absent Massachusetts precedent, decisions\n\nelsewhere construing standard CGL language may be useful.\n\n           Generally, the policy provides that American Home \"will\n\npay those sums that [AGM] becomes legally obligated to pay as\n\ndamages because of 'bodily injury' or 'property damage' to which\n\nthis   insurance   applies.\"     Such   damages     must    be   caused    by   an\n\n\"occurrence,\" defined as \"an accident, including continuous or\n\nrepeated   exposure    to   substantially     the    same    general      harmful\n\nconditions.\"     There are also numerous exclusions to coverage.\n\n           American Home's position is that there was neither an\n\n\"occurrence\" nor \"property damage,\" and that even if there were,\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\ftwo different exclusions apply:           the \"damage to Assured's work\"\n\nexclusion and the \"damage to Assured's product\" exclusion.                AGM\n\ntakes the opposite position on each issue and, in addition, argues\n\nthat there is coverage for damage to the docks under the \"product-\n\ncompleted   operations    hazard\"   and    that   public   policy   requires\n\ncoverage for the costs of recovering the docks after they broke\n\nloose.\n\n            That there should be doubts about the presence of an\n\n\"occurrence\"   or   \"property   damage\"      might   initially   puzzle    an\n\nobserver because the storm was obviously an \"occurrence\" in the\n\ncommon use of the term, and the breaking loose of the dock and its\n\nsubsequent damage is easily described as an \"accident\" that led to\n\n\"property damage.\"       The doubts that some courts have expressed\n\narise because CGL coverage is primarily directed to liabilities\n\nother than defects in one's own work. As the Massachusetts Supreme\n\nJudicial Court said, quoting an article on insurance:\n\n            The risk intended to be insured is the\n            possibility that the goods, products or work\n            of   the   insured,  once   relinquished   or\n            completed, will cause bodily injury or damage\n            to property other than to the product or\n            completed work itself . . . . 1\n\n\n     1\n      Commerce Ins. Co. v. Betty Caplette Builders, Inc., 647\nN.E.2d 1211, 1213 (Mass. 1995) (emphasis supplied) (quoting Roger\nC. Henderson, Insurance Protection for Products Liability and\nCompleted Operations: What Every Lawyer Should Know, 50 Neb. L.\nRev. 415, 441 (1971)); see also Farmington Cas. Co. v. Duggan, 417\nF.3d 1141, 1142 (10th Cir. 2005); Modern Equip. Co. v. Continental\nWestern Ins. Co., 355 F.3d 1125, 1129 (8th Cir. 2004); Russ, 9A\nCouch on Insurance ยง 129:1 (3d ed. 1995).\n\n                                    -5-\n\f            A curious split in authority has resulted.            Some courts\n\nhave held that faulty workmanship by the insured, so far as damage\n\nis only to its product, does not constitute an \"occurrence\" under\n\nCGL policies, e.g., Auto-Owners Ins. v. Home Pride Cos., 684 N.W.2d\n\n571, 577 (Neb. 2004); see also Russ, 9A Couch on Insurance ยง 129:4\n\n(3d ed. 1995); and others have held that faulty workmanship does\n\nnot constitute \"property damage,\" e.g., Amtrol, Inc. v. Tudor Ins.\n\nCo., 2002 WL 31194863, at *6 (D. Mass. 2002).           By contrast, other\n\ncourts have focused solely upon the exclusions of the CGL policy.\n\nE.g., Caplette, 647 N.E.2d at 1213.\n\n            The cases that have refused coverage at the occurrence or\n\nproperty damage threshold often involve the discovery of a latent\n\ndefect or of an emerging negative condition (like construction\n\ndefects,    leaking    water   heaters,    peeling     paint,   or   cracking\n\nfloors).2   In such cases a court might well question whether there\n\nis   literally   an   \"occurrence\"   or    \"property    damage\"   due   to   an\n\n\"occurrence.\"    But in this case what happened to the docks was far\n\nfrom a mere latent condition or slow deterioration, so many of the\n\ncases refusing coverage are distinguishable.\n\n            Whether Massachusetts would follow the \"occurrence\" cases\n\nis not certain.       In Caplette the Supreme Judicial Court bypassed\n\nthe issue in a case involving damage to the insured's product,\n\n\n      2\n      Home Pride Cos., 684 N.W.2d at 574; Amtrol, 2002 WL 31194863,\nat *2; Indiana Ins. Co. v. Hydra Corp., 615 N.E.2d 70, 73 (Ill.\nApp. Ct. 1993).\n\n                                     -6-\n\fgoing instead directly to the exclusions.            This might suggest that\n\nthe   SJC    thought    that      the   occurrence    and   property   damage\n\nrequirements were satisfied, but the parties did not dispute the\n\nissue.      In all events, one of the exclusions in this case bars\n\ncoverage even if we assume arguendo that there was an occurrence\n\nand property damage within the meaning of the policy.\n\n             We deal first with the \"Assured's work\" exclusion.           The\n\n\"Assured's work\" exclusion excludes coverage under the policy for\n\nthe following:\n\n      \"Property damage\" to \"the Assured's work\" arising out of\n      it or any part of it and included in the \"products-\n      completed operations hazard.\" This exclusion does not\n      apply if the damaged work or the work out of which the\n      damage arises was performed on the Assured's behalf by a\n      subcontractor.\n\n             Under the definitions section of the policy, \"Assured's\n\nwork\" includes \"work or operations performed by the Assured or on\n\n[its] behalf.\"    So at first blush, the \"Assured's work\" appears to\n\ninclude work done by Southeast, assuming that Southeast were a\n\nsubcontractor.         But   if   Southeast   were   a   subcontractor,   the\n\nexclusion would not apply by virtue of its second sentence.            And if\n\ninstead Southeast were merely a vendor who supplied a product and\n\nnot a subcontractor, the docks would not be the \"Assured's work\" or\n\nwork done on \"its behalf,\" so again the exclusion would not apply.\n\n             Of course, the exclusion would apply if the harm arose\n\nout of AGM's own work rather than that of Southeast.            However, the\n\narbitrator found that the original cause of the breaking away of\n\n                                        -7-\n\fthe docks was faulty work by Southeast including failure to follow\n\nspecifications.     Conceivably American Home could contest this\n\nfinding   and   blame   AGM   (the   insurer   was   not   a   party    to   the\n\narbitration).     We need not pursue this possibility because the\n\n\"Assured's product\" exclusion does appear to bar coverage, even if\n\nthe \"Assured's work\" exclusion does not.\n\n           The \"Assured's product\" exclusion precludes recovery for\n\n\"'property damage' to 'the Assured's product' arising out of it or\n\nany part of it.\" The policy defines \"Assured's product\" to include\n\n\"any goods or products, other than real property, manufactured,\n\nsold, handled, or distributed by . . . [t]he Assured.\"                       The\n\n\"Assured's product\" exclusion, like the \"Assured's work\" exclusion,\n\nis broadly consistent with the limited office of CGL coverage to\n\nprotect against liability for harm \"other than to the product or\n\ncompleted work itself.\"       Caplette, 647 N.E.2d at 1213.\n\n           AGM disputes that the docks were its product, saying that\n\nthey were made by Southeast.         But if AGM acquired the docks from\n\nSoutheast as a vendor and resold them to Provincetown, \"sold\"\n\napplies; if they were made by Southeast as a subcontractor and\n\ninstalled by AGM (and transferred to Provincetown as part of the\n\noverall project), they were at least \"handled\" by AGM.3                So AGM's\n\n\n     3\n      AGM's argument that case law supports its claim that it did\nnot \"handle\" the docks is unavailing. Gulf Miss. Marine Corp. v.\nGeorge   Engine  Co.,   697   F.2d  668   (5th   Cir.  1983),   is\ndistinguishable. In Gulf the insured party was a subcontractor who\nmerely touched the components while assembling them; here AGM was\n\n                                     -8-\n\fresponse does not avoid the embracing language of the definition\n\nthat triggers the exclusion.\n\n                 Whether the docks come within the real property exception\n\nfound       in   the   definition    of   \"Assured's    product\"   is   a   closer\n\nquestion.         The exception for real property eliminates from the\n\nexclusion a building constructed on the land and, arguably, a pier\n\nbuilt upon and planted in submerged land (MacMillan Pier itself\n\nlikely fits this description).             But the main floating docks were\n\ntethered by the u-brackets and pilings rather than affixed to the\n\nsubmerged land below and the finger docks were connected to the\n\nmain docks even more loosely.\n\n                 The   technical    definition   of    real   property,     in   the\n\ndictionary and some of the case law, covers those things \"attached\n\nto, or erected on [the land], excluding anything that may be\n\nsevered without injury to the land.\"4                 Similarly, Massachusetts\n\ncase law defines real property as property \"so annexed that it\n\ncannot be removed without material injury to the real estate or to\n\nitself.\" Medford Trust Co. v. Priggen Steel Garage Co., 174 N.E.2d\n\n\n\nresponsible for procuring the docks and providing them in their\nfinal form to Provincetown.\n        4\n      Black's Law Dictionary (8th ed. 2004) (emphasis supplied);\nsee also Wanzek Constr. v. Employers Ins., 679 N.W.2d 322, 327\n(Minn. 2004) (citing Black's Law Dictionary in a CGL case);\nAmerican Equity Ins. Co. v. Van Ginhoven, 788 So. 2d 388 (Dist. Ct.\nApp. Fla. 2001) (citing Black's Law Dictionary and stating that\n\"[t]he term 'real property' is a clearly understandable and defined\nlegal term\").\n\n                                          -9-\n\f126, 128 (Mass. 1930).           There is also good deal of related law\n\nseeking to determine whether an item is a \"fixture\"โ-personal\n\nproperty that becomes part of the real property, Bernheim, 2\n\nTiffany Real Property ยง 606 (3d ed. 1939 & Supp. 2006).\n\n              Case law as to whether floating docks are \"real property\"\n\nis not uniform-โwhich is unsurprising because the issue              arises\n\nunder various statutes and in different contexts (sales, taxes,\n\ncondemnation).       A leading federal tax decision says that floating\n\ndocks are not real property, Morgan v. Comm'r of Internal Revenue,\n\n52 T.C. 478, 483 (Tax Ct. 1969); see also Rev. Rul. 75-178, 1975-1\n\nC.B. 9, 1975 WL 34655.       No Massachusetts case involving a floating\n\ndock has been cited to us, and case law in other jurisdictions is\n\ndivided.5\n\n              Putting the divided cases to one side, the docks in this\n\ncase       were   shipped   to    Provincetown   and--instead   of    being\n\nincorporated physically into the land or ocean bottom--were used as\n\nfloating concrete platforms, much like a tied-up barge.         Under the\n\nclassic definition of real property, the floating docks do not\n\nqualify as real property.         They could easily be, and were in fact,\n\nsevered from MacMillan Pier:          the marine surveyor's report shows\n\n\n       5\n      Compare Newport Island Yacht Club v. Inver Grove Heights\nMarina, Inc., 1995 WL 70215, at *2 (Minn. App. Ct. Feb. 21, 1995)\n(floating docks are personal property) with Taylor v. Township of\nLower, 13 N.J. Tax 371, 387 (N.J. Tax Ct. 1993) (floating docks are\nreal property).    Pointlessly, American Home cites cases in its\nfavor interpreting policies that happen to lack the real property\nexception.\n\n                                      -10-\n\fthat, without injury to MacMillan Pier, the docks sank or broke\n\nfree and others were hoisted onto the pier after the storm.\n\n            One might argue that the docks and piles taken together\n\ncomprise AGM's \"product\" and therefore \"real property\" for purposes\n\nof the \"Assured's product\" exclusion--given that the piles are\n\nembedded    in   the   ocean   floor.     But   the    \"severability\"   aspect\n\nimplicit in Black's definition of real property contemplates that\n\nsome items which are conceptually or even physically \"connected\" to\n\nreal property may be so readily removable that they never lose\n\ntheir nature as personal property.\n\n            For example, courts have held that mobile homes, even\n\nwhere anchored to the ground and attached to utility lines, remain\n\npersonal property.       E.g., United States v. Shelby County, Tenn.,\n\n385   F.   Supp.   1187,   1189   (W.D.    Tenn.      1974).   Similarly,   a\n\nMassachusetts court noted that machines may remain chattels where\n\nthe attachment to the land \"merely stead[ies]\" property for \"more\n\nconvenient use.\"        Carpenter v. Walker, 5 N.E. 160, 162 (Mass.\n\n1886).     We conclude that the floating docks do not comprise real\n\nproperty under Massachusetts law.\n\n            Ambiguities in the policy are construed against the\n\ninsurer, B & T Masonry Constr. Co. v. Pub. Serv. Mutual Ins. Co.,\n\n382 F.3d 36, 39 (1st Cir. 2004), but the general definition of real\n\nproperty excludes floating docks that can be removed without damage\n\nand we are offered no coherent counter-definition to set against\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fthe   classic     definition,   which   has   at   least   the    advantage   of\n\nmechanical application.         That the floating docks may be close to\n\nthe line--being big structures that ordinarily are not moved about-\n\n-does not make the line itself uncertain.\n\n            It would be a different matter if there were some obvious\n\nrationale for the real property exception in the policy that would\n\nbe frustrated by applying the classic definition.                But, so far as\n\nwe can tell, the exception came about almost by happenstance;6 and,\n\nso far as we understand the rationale for the \"Assured's product\"\n\nexclusion itself, as described in Caplette, it appears to apply\n\nwith full force to the floating docks.\n\n            AGM    has   yet   one   more   argument.      It   says   that   the\n\n\"products-completed operations hazard\" (\"PCOH\") provides it with\n\ncoverage.    PCOH is defined, with exceptions not here relevant, to\n\ninclude \"all . . . 'property damage' occurring away from premises\n\nthe Assured owns or rents\" where work has been completed.                Within\n\nthe policy, several of the exclusions are made inapplicable to\n\n\n\n      6\n      Earlier CGL policies did not have the real property\nexception; and, in construing such policies, courts divided as to\nwhether the phrase \"manufactured, sold, handled, or distributed\"\nimplicitly excluded real property, compare, e.g., Mid-United\nContractors, Ins. v. Providence Lloyds Ins. Co., 754 S.W.2d 824,\n826 (a building is not a product \"because in ordinary language\nbuildings are constructed or erected, not manufactured\"), with\nCaplette, 647 N.E.2d at 1214 (a building is a product of its\nbuilder). The ISO inserted the real property language to resolve\nthe matter.     Cunningham & Fischer, Insurance Coverage in\nConstruction--The Unanswered Question, 33 Tort & Ins. L.J. 1063,\n1095-1096 (1998).\n\n                                      -12-\n\fcoverage found in PCOH.                 For example, the \"damage to property\"\n\nexclusion has an exception for \"'property damage' included in the\n\n'products-completed operations hazard.'\"\n\n             Seemingly, the damage to the docks would come within the\n\nclause defining PCOH.             But, contrary to AGM's premise, the policy\n\ndoes not on its own provide coverage for damage within the PCOH\n\nclause.      The clause merely renders a given exclusion inapplicable\n\nwhere    that    exclusion         so    provides.       The       \"Assured's       product\"\n\nexclusion contains no reference to the clause and therefore remains\n\napplicable to PCOH damage.\n\n             Although        we    conclude      that    the       \"Assured's       product\"\n\nexclusion       does    apply      to    the    damage      suffered     by     the    docks\n\nthemselves, this does not quite end the story.                       It means that the\n\ncost of replacing the floating docks (apparently about $230,000) is\n\nnot covered by the policy; but AGM's claims were not only for the\n\ncost    of   replacing       the    docks      but   also    for    emergency       work   in\n\nrecovering the sunken or loose docks and for the cost of providing\n\ntemporary docks in the interim.\n\n             Non-coverage of the temporary docks and the emergency\n\nwork follows from non-coverage of the docks themselves.                          The basic\n\ncoverage under the CGL policy is for liability incurred \"because\n\nof\" \"property damage\" (\"bodily injury\" is not present in this\n\ncase).       Thus,     the   cost       of   temporary      replacement       for     covered\n\nproperty might well be recoverable.                     But it is hard to see how\n\n\n                                             -13-\n\fcoverage       would     exist    for    temporary    replacement    of    excluded\n\nproperty.       AGM points to no policy language or rationale for such\n\ncoverage.\n\n               Non-coverage is also clear as to the emergency work.\n\nThat work on its face is even harder to classify as liability for\n\nproperty       damage--save       that   courts   have   been   willing    in   some\n\ncircumstances to include the cost of emergency efforts on the\n\npremise that the insured is mitigating insured losses that would\n\notherwise be borne by the insurance company and that it serves\n\npublic policy to encourage such mitigation.7\n\n               This rationale fails if the property losses to the\n\nrelevant product are themselves not covered and the insured has no\n\nobligation to replace the property.                  To be sure, public policy\n\nmight want to encourage mitigation, but not necessarily at the\n\ninsurer's expense, and anyway AGM had a substantial self-interest\n\nin mitigating losses itself.             It might be a different case if the\n\ndocks had actually threatened bodily injury or third-party property\n\ndamage for which American Home could be responsible.\n\n               The rationale for the patchwork coverage provided by the\n\nCGL policy is obscure and especially hard to understand without\n\nmore       information    about    other    coverages    available   for    product\n\n\n\n       7\n      Intel Corp. v.

This insurance coverage case arises\n\nout   of   the   following    events.      In   fall   2000,   the   Town   of\n\nProvincetown, Massachusetts (\"Provincetown\"), contracted with AGM\n\nMarine Contractors (\"AGM\") to reconstruct MacMillan Pier on the\n\nProvincetown waterfront and to procure and install a concrete\n\nfloating dock system.          Under AGM's superintendence, Southeast\n\nFloating Docks (\"Southeast\") agreed to provide floating docks for\n\nMacMillan Pier.    Installation of the new dock system was completed\n\nin June 2003.\n\n            There were two main floating docks (A and B) extending\n\noutward from MacMillan Pier.            These main docks floated on the\n\nsurface of the water but stayed in position next to MacMillan Pier\n\nbecause piles, planted in the ground below the water's surface, ran\n\nthough u-brackets on the sides of the floating docks.            A number of\n\nsmaller \"finger\" floating docks extended from the main floating\n\ndocks and were held in place by connections to the main docks.\n\n            A strong winter storm occurred during December 5-7, 2003.\n\nSome of the floating docks broke loose; some sank; and most were\n\nirreparably damaged.         Immediately after the storm, Provincetown\n\ndirected AGM to retrieve the docks, which it did.              AGM was later\n\nrequired by the town to provide replacement docks.              AGM incurred\n\nsignificant costs which it sought to recover from both insurance\n\nand from Southeast (which it accused of having failed to follow\n\nspecifications in building the docks).\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f            In March 2004, AGM notified American Home Assurance\n\nCompany (\"American Home\") of a claim under the commercial marine\n\nliability policy that American Home had issued to AGM, providing\n\ncoverage from January 1, 2003 to January 1, 2004 (\"the policy\").\n\nThe policy is based on the standard Commercial General Liability\n\nCoverage (\"CGL\") form written by the Insurance Services Office\n\n(\"ISO\"), an organization of insurance companies that prepares\n\nstandard form contracts, among other things.\n\n            American Home denied AGM's claim for coverage and on June\n\n17, 2004, filed a petition for declaratory judgment in the federal\n\ndistrict    court    in   Massachusetts     to   establish   that   it    had   no\n\nliability    under    the   policy.       AGM    counterclaimed     and   sought\n\nrecovery for the cost of recovering the docks, loss of use of the\n\ndocks and for repairing damage to the docks or replacing them.\n\nBoth sides moved for summary judgment.\n\n            On July 25, 2005, the district court granted summary\n\njudgment in favor of American Home, concluding that the policy did\n\nnot cover the losses for which AGM sought recovery.

Absent Massachusetts precedent, decisions\n\nelsewhere construing standard CGL language may be useful.\n\n           Generally, the policy provides that American Home \"will\n\npay those sums that [AGM] becomes legally obligated to pay as\n\ndamages because of 'bodily injury' or 'property damage' to which\n\nthis   insurance   applies.\"     Such   damages     must    be   caused    by   an\n\n\"occurrence,\" defined as \"an accident, including continuous or\n\nrepeated   exposure    to   substantially     the    same    general      harmful\n\nconditions.\"     There are also numerous exclusions to coverage.\n\n           American Home's position is that there was neither an\n\n\"occurrence\" nor \"property damage,\" and that even if there were,\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\ftwo different exclusions apply:           the \"damage to Assured's work\"\n\nexclusion and the \"damage to Assured's product\" exclusion.                AGM\n\ntakes the opposite position on each issue and, in addition, argues\n\nthat there is coverage for damage to the docks under the \"product-\n\ncompleted   operations    hazard\"   and    that   public   policy   requires\n\ncoverage for the costs of recovering the docks after they broke\n\nloose.\n\n            That there should be doubts about the presence of an\n\n\"occurrence\"   or   \"property   damage\"      might   initially   puzzle    an\n\nobserver because the storm was obviously an \"occurrence\" in the\n\ncommon use of the term, and the breaking loose of the dock and its\n\nsubsequent damage is easily described as an \"accident\" that led to\n\n\"property damage.\"       The doubts that some courts have expressed\n\narise because CGL coverage is primarily directed to liabilities\n\nother than defects in one's own work. As the Massachusetts Supreme\n\nJudicial Court said, quoting an article on insurance:\n\n            The risk intended to be insured is the\n            possibility that the goods, products or work\n            of   the   insured,  once   relinquished   or\n            completed, will cause bodily injury or damage\n            to property other than to the product or\n            completed work itself . . . . 1\n\n\n     1\n      Commerce Ins.

This might suggest that\n\nthe   SJC    thought    that      the   occurrence    and   property   damage\n\nrequirements were satisfied, but the parties did not dispute the\n\nissue.      In all events, one of the exclusions in this case bars\n\ncoverage even if we assume arguendo that there was an occurrence\n\nand property damage within the meaning of the policy.\n\n             We deal first with the \"Assured's work\" exclusion.           The\n\n\"Assured's work\" exclusion excludes coverage under the policy for\n\nthe following:\n\n      \"Property damage\" to \"the Assured's work\" arising out of\n      it or any part of it and included in the \"products-\n      completed operations hazard.\" This exclusion does not\n      apply if the damaged work or the work out of which the\n      damage arises was performed on the Assured's behalf by a\n      subcontractor.\n\n             Under the definitions section of the policy, \"Assured's\n\nwork\" includes \"work or operations performed by the Assured or on\n\n[its] behalf.\"    So at first blush, the \"Assured's work\" appears to\n\ninclude work done by Southeast, assuming that Southeast were a\n\nsubcontractor.         But   if   Southeast   were   a   subcontractor,   the\n\nexclusion would not apply by virtue of its second sentence.            And if\n\ninstead Southeast were merely a vendor who supplied a product and\n\nnot a subcontractor, the docks would not be the \"Assured's work\" or\n\nwork done on \"its behalf,\" so again the exclusion would not apply.\n\n             Of course, the exclusion would apply if the harm arose\n\nout of AGM's own work rather than that of Southeast.            However, the\n\narbitrator found that the original cause of the breaking away of\n\n                                        -7-\n\fthe docks was faulty work by Southeast including failure to follow\n\nspecifications.     Conceivably American Home could contest this\n\nfinding   and   blame   AGM   (the   insurer   was   not   a   party    to   the\n\narbitration).     We need not pursue this possibility because the\n\n\"Assured's product\" exclusion does appear to bar coverage, even if\n\nthe \"Assured's work\" exclusion does not.\n\n           The \"Assured's product\" exclusion precludes recovery for\n\n\"'property damage' to 'the Assured's product' arising out of it or\n\nany part of it.\" The policy defines \"Assured's product\" to include\n\n\"any goods or products, other than real property, manufactured,\n\nsold, handled, or distributed by . . . [t]he Assured.\"                       The\n\n\"Assured's product\" exclusion, like the \"Assured's work\" exclusion,\n\nis broadly consistent with the limited office of CGL coverage to\n\nprotect against liability for harm \"other than to the product or\n\ncompleted work itself.\"       Caplette, 647 N.E.2d at 1213.\n\n           AGM disputes that the docks were its product, saying that\n\nthey were made by Southeast.         But if AGM acquired the docks from\n\nSoutheast as a vendor and resold them to Provincetown, \"sold\"\n\napplies; if they were made by Southeast as a subcontractor and\n\ninstalled by AGM (and transferred to Provincetown as part of the\n\noverall project), they were at least \"handled\" by AGM.3                So AGM's\n\n\n     3\n      AGM's argument that case law supports its claim that it did\nnot \"handle\" the docks is unavailing.

The exception for real property eliminates from the\n\nexclusion a building constructed on the land and, arguably, a pier\n\nbuilt upon and planted in submerged land (MacMillan Pier itself\n\nlikely fits this description).

That the floating docks may be close to\n\nthe line--being big structures that ordinarily are not moved about-\n\n-does not make the line itself uncertain.\n\n            It would be a different matter if there were some obvious\n\nrationale for the real property exception in the policy that would\n\nbe frustrated by applying the classic definition.                But, so far as\n\nwe can tell, the exception came about almost by happenstance;6 and,\n\nso far as we understand the rationale for the \"Assured's product\"\n\nexclusion itself, as described in Caplette, it appears to apply\n\nwith full force to the floating docks.\n\n            AGM    has   yet   one   more   argument.      It   says   that   the\n\n\"products-completed operations hazard\" (\"PCOH\") provides it with\n\ncoverage.    PCOH is defined, with exceptions not here relevant, to\n\ninclude \"all . . . 'property damage' occurring away from premises\n\nthe Assured owns or rents\" where work has been completed.                Within\n\nthe policy, several of the exclusions are made inapplicable to\n\n\n\n      6\n      Earlier CGL policies did not have the real property\nexception; and, in construing such policies, courts divided as to\nwhether the phrase \"manufactured, sold, handled, or distributed\"\nimplicitly excluded real property, compare, e.g., Mid-United\nContractors, Ins. v.

For example, the \"damage to property\"\n\nexclusion has an exception for \"'property damage' included in the\n\n'products-completed operations hazard.'\"\n\n             Seemingly, the damage to the docks would come within the\n\nclause defining PCOH.             But, contrary to AGM's premise, the policy\n\ndoes not on its own provide coverage for damage within the PCOH\n\nclause.      The clause merely renders a given exclusion inapplicable\n\nwhere    that    exclusion         so    provides.       The       \"Assured's       product\"\n\nexclusion contains no reference to the clause and therefore remains\n\napplicable to PCOH damage.\n\n             Although        we    conclude      that    the       \"Assured's       product\"\n\nexclusion       does    apply      to    the    damage      suffered     by     the    docks\n\nthemselves, this does not quite end the story.                       It means that the\n\ncost of replacing the floating docks (apparently about $230,000) is\n\nnot covered by the policy; but AGM's claims were not only for the\n\ncost    of   replacing       the    docks      but   also    for    emergency       work   in\n\nrecovering the sunken or loose docks and for the cost of providing\n\ntemporary docks in the interim.\n\n             Non-coverage of the temporary docks and the emergency\n\nwork follows from non-coverage of the docks themselves.                          The basic\n\ncoverage under the CGL policy is for liability incurred \"because\n\nof\" \"property damage\" (\"bodily injury\" is not present in this\n\ncase).       Thus,     the   cost       of   temporary      replacement       for     covered\n\nproperty might well be recoverable.                     But it is hard to see how\n\n\n                                             -13-\n\fcoverage       would     exist    for    temporary    replacement    of    excluded\n\nproperty.       AGM points to no policy language or rationale for such\n\ncoverage.\n\n               Non-coverage is also clear as to the emergency work.\n\nThat work on its face is even harder to classify as liability for\n\nproperty       damage--save       that   courts   have   been   willing    in   some\n\ncircumstances to include the cost of emergency efforts on the\n\npremise that the insured is mitigating insured losses that would\n\notherwise be borne by the insurance company and that it serves\n\npublic policy to encourage such mitigation.7\n\n               This rationale fails if the property losses to the\n\nrelevant product are themselves not covered and the insured has no\n\nobligation to replace the property.                  To be sure, public policy\n\nmight want to encourage mitigation, but not necessarily at the\n\ninsurer's expense, and anyway AGM had a substantial self-interest\n\nin mitigating losses itself.             It might be a different case if the\n\ndocks had actually threatened bodily injury or third-party property\n\ndamage for which American Home could be responsible.\n\n               The rationale for the patchwork coverage provided by the\n\nCGL policy is obscure and especially hard to understand without\n\nmore       information    about    other    coverages    available   for    product\n\n\n\n       7\n      Intel Corp. v.
