RODWELL,\n\n                     Petitioner, Appellant,\n\n                                v.\n\n                    PETER A.

Young, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                      Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n                  Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                    and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Kevin J.

The    case   at   bar       presents   a\n\nquestion    of    first   impression      in    this     circuit        regarding     the\n\ncircumstances under which a state prisoner may use Rule 60(b) of\n\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as a vehicle for resurrecting\n\na previously dismissed habeas petition.                There are three principal\n\nschools of thought on this controversial subject. Some courts have\n\nheld that    Rule    60(b)     remains    fully       velivolant    in       the    habeas\n\ncontext.    Others have held that the restrictions imposed on the\n\nfiling of second or successive applications for habeas relief by\n\nthe Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) of 1996,\n\nPub. L. No. 104-132, §§ 101-107, 110 Stat. 1214, 1217-26 (codified\n\nas amended in 28 U.S.C. §§ 2244, 2253-2255, 2261-2266 (2000)), make\n\nRule 60(b)       unavailable    to   habeas     petitioners.            A    third    camp\n\nconsists of courts that, with slight variations, advocate a course\n\nsomewhere between these extremes.\n\n            We    align   ourselves      with     the    third     camp.           AEDPA's\n\nrestrictions on the filing of second or successive habeas petitions\n\nmake it implausible to believe that Congress wanted Rule 60(b) to\n\noperate under full throttle in the habeas context. But even though\n\nstate prisoners seeking habeas relief should not be able to use\n\nRule 60(b) as a means of avoiding AEDPA's carefully calibrated\n\nlimitations on habeas petitions, we see no justification for\n\nthrowing out the baby with the bath water.                 Consequently, we hold\n\nthat   a   Rule   60(b)   motion     should     be     treated     as    a   second     or\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fsuccessive habeas petition if — and only if — the factual predicate\n\nset forth in support of the motion constitutes a direct challenge\n\nto the constitutionality of the underlying conviction.             In other\n\ncases — cases in which the factual predicate set forth in support\n\nof the motion attacks only the manner in which the earlier habeas\n\njudgment has been procured — the motion may be adjudicated under\n\nthe jurisprudence of Rule 60(b).\n\n           In this instance, the petitioner's Rule 60(b) motion is\n\nthe functional equivalent of a new habeas petition.             Because that\n\ntriggers the AEDPA's requirements for second or successive habeas\n\npetitions, we affirm the district court's order of dismissal.\n\nI.   TRAVEL OF THE CASE\n\n           Since this appeal turns on a question of procedure, the\n\ntravel of the case comprises the relevant background.\n\n           In   November   of    1981,    petitioner-appellant     James   J.\n\nRodwell stood trial in a Massachusetts state court on a number of\n\ncharges, including first degree murder, armed robbery, and unlawful\n\ncarriage of a firearm.     One of the key witnesses against him was a\n\nfellow inmate, David Nagle, who testified that, while awaiting\n\ntrial, the petitioner had admitted to the murder and furnished many\n\ndetails.    The   jury   found    the    petitioner   guilty.     The   court\n\nthereafter imposed a mandatory term of life imprisonment on the\n\nmurder charge and lesser sentences on the other counts.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f            In 1983, the petitioner filed an unsuccessful motion for\n\na new trial.      Two years later, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial\n\nCourt (SJC) affirmed both his conviction and the denial of his new\n\ntrial motion.        See Commonwealth v. Rodwell, 477 N.E.2d 385 (Mass.\n\n1985).      The      following     year,   the     petitioner    filed     another\n\nunsuccessful motion for a new trial.             This time, the SJC denied his\n\napplication for further appellate review.\n\n            Having     exhausted    his    state   remedies,    the    petitioner\n\nsought a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court\n\nfor the District of Massachusetts.            He named, as the respondent, a\n\nstate correctional official.1 His petition alleged that Nagle was,\n\nin    effect,   an    undercover    government      agent    while    he   and   the\n\npetitioner were incarcerated together; that Nagle's inquiries about\n\nthe crime amounted to a post-indictment state interrogation without\n\nhis   lawyer    present;    that    Nagle's      testimony   should    have      been\n\nexcluded as procured in violation of the Sixth Amendment; and that,\n\ntherefore, his conviction could not pass constitutional muster.\n\nThe district court denied the petition.              Rodwell v. Fair, No. 86-\n\n2455, slip op. (D. Mass. Apr. 13, 1987) (unpublished). We affirmed\n\nthe denial, holding that the petitioner had not shown \"cause\" for\n\nfailing to present evidence in support of his Sixth Amendment claim\n\n\n\n       1\n      The original respondent, Michael Fair, is no longer in\noffice. His successor, Peter A. Pepe, Jr., has been substituted by\noperation of law. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(d)(1); Fed. R. App. P.\n43(c)(2).\n\n                                       -4-\n\fin the state court.        Rodwell v. Fair, 834 F.2d 240, 241-42 (1st\n\nCir. 1987) (per curiam).\n\n          The petitioner was not deterred.          Following a lull, he\n\nfiled three more motions for a new trial in the state courts.           Each\n\nof these was denied, and further appeals in the state system proved\n\nfruitless.\n\n          At that juncture, the petitioner again eyed a federal\n\nforum — but an obstacle loomed.         The AEDPA had taken effect and,\n\nunder its terms, state prisoners cannot file second or successive\n\nfederal habeas petitions as a matter of right.             See 28 U.S.C. §\n\n2244(b)(3).      Rather, a state prisoner who desires to file a second\n\nor successive habeas petition must secure pre-clearance from the\n\ncourt of appeals.        See id. § 2244(b)(3)(A).    On October 4, 1999,\n\nthe petitioner invoked this provision and requested permission to\n\nfile a second habeas corpus petition.\n\n             A   panel    of   this   court   carefully    considered    his\n\napplication and concluded that the petitioner had failed to produce\n\nany new facts, sufficient to show his actual innocence clearly and\n\nconvincingly, which could not have been discovered through the\n\nexercise of due diligence at or before the time when he filed his\n\nfirst federal habeas petition.        Rodwell v. Pepe, No. 99-2109, slip\n\nop. at 1 (1st Cir. Nov. 4, 1999) (unpublished).           Consequently, the\n\npanel refused the petitioner's request to file a second federal\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fhabeas petition.      Id. Under the AEDPA, this decision was final and\n\nunappealable.      See 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b)(3)(E).\n\n             Attempting to find a crack in the wall that Congress had\n\nerected to guard against the profligate filing of successive\n\napplications for post-conviction relief, the petitioner repaired to\n\nthe district court.       On July 6, 2001, he filed a motion to reopen\n\nhis original federal habeas case.           Asserting that the prosecution\n\nhad suppressed \"exculpatory evidence\" that shed doubt on Nagle's\n\nstatus and that \"it was not until well after his conviction, direct\n\nappeal     and   habeas   denial   that   th[is]   significant   impeachment\n\ninformation was unearthed,\" he asked the district court to reverse\n\nits earlier denial of habeas relief.\n\n             The district court, Rodwell v. Pepe, 183 F. Supp. 2d 129,\n\n133 (D. Mass. 2001), reasonably construed the petitioner's motion\n\nas one brought pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)2\n\n\n     2\n         The rule states in pertinent part:\n\n     On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may\n     relieve a party . . . from a final judgment . . . for the\n     following reasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise,\n     or excusable neglect; (2) newly discovered evidence which\n     by due diligence could not have been discovered in time\n     to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b); (3) fraud . .\n     . , misrepresentation, or other misconduct by an adverse\n     party; (4) the judgment is void; (5) the judgment has\n     been satisfied, released, or discharged, . . . or it is\n     no longer equitable that the judgment should have\n     prospective application; or (6) any other reason\n     justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 60(b).    Motions under this rule must be made\n\"within a reasonable time, and for reasons (1), (2), and (3) not\n\n                                      -6-\n\f— a characterization that the petitioner enthusiastically embraced.\n\nTurning to the question of whether a Rule 60(b) motion seeking\n\nvacation of a judgment denying habeas relief should be treated as\n\na second or successive habeas petition for AEDPA purposes, the\n\ndistrict court answered that question affirmatively.               Id. at 133-\n\n34.    On   that   basis,   the   court     ruled     that   it   was   without\n\njurisdiction to hear the motion.          Id. at 134-35 (citing 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2244(b)(3)).     In a subsequent order, the court, recognizing that\n\nthe   pertinent    authorities    were    in   some    disarray,    granted   a\n\ncertificate of appealability (COA), see 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c), thus\n\nallowing this appeal to proceed.\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n            The COA poses a single question:             does a motion for\n\nrelief presented pursuant to Rule 60(b) constitute a second or\n\nsubsequent petition under the AEDPA?           Despite its narrowness, this\n\nquestion has significant implications for habeas procedure — and\n\nthe courts of appeals that heretofore have grappled with it have\n\nreached divergent conclusions.\n\n            We begin by addressing the certified question.                After\n\nanswering it, we proceed to apply the answer to the case at bar.\n\n\n\n\nmore than one year after the judgment . . . was entered or taken.\"\nId.\n\n                                    -7-\n\f                  A.    Determining the Rule of Law.\n\n            As said, the decisions elsewhere have yielded three lines\n\nof cases.    We turn first to the polar extremes.\n\n            The Second Circuit has ruled categorically that \"a motion\n\nunder Rule 60(b) to vacate a judgment denying habeas is not a\n\nsecond or successive habeas petition and should therefore be\n\ntreated as any other motion under Rule 60(b).\"          Rodriguez v.\n\nMitchell, 252 F.3d 191, 198 (2d Cir. 2001).       The court reasoned\n\nthat a Rule 60(b) motion does not seek the relief requested by a\n\nhabeas petition, but, rather, \"seeks only to vacate the federal\n\ncourt judgment dismissing the habeas petition.\"        Id.   That is\n\n\"merely a step along the way\" to habeas relief.         Id. at 199.\n\nConsequently, affording Rule 60(b) its customary scope does not\n\noffend the AEDPA.      Id.\n\n            At the other end of the spectrum, several courts have\n\nconcluded that a Rule 60(b) motion in a habeas case must always be\n\ntreated as a second or successive habeas petition under the AEDPA.\n\nSee, e.g., Mobley v. Head, 306 F.3d 1096, 1096 (11th Cir. 2002);\n\nLopez v. Douglas, 141 F.3d 974, 975 (10th Cir. 1998) (per curiam);\n\nMcQueen v. Scroggy, 99 F.3d 1302, 1335 (6th Cir. 1996).          The\n\nEleventh Circuit is the leading proponent of this proposition.    In\n\nthat court's view, according Rule 60(b) its customary scope in\n\nhabeas cases would allow prisoners to cloak collateral attacks in\n\nthe raiment of motions for relief from judgment under Rule 60(b)\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fand thereby evade the limitations that Congress so painstakingly\n\ncrafted in the AEDPA.       See Mobley, 306 F.3d at 1096; Felker v.\n\nTurpin, 101 F.3d 657, 661 (11th Cir. 1996) (per curiam).                   Based on\n\nthis   rationale,   the     court    concluded       that       allowing    habeas\n\npetitioners   access   to   Rule     60(b)   would    contravene       the    very\n\ncongressional intent that motivated passage of the AEDPA.                      See\n\nFelker, 101 F.3d at 661 (\"Rule 60(b) cannot be used to circumvent\n\nrestraints on successive habeas petitions.                That was true before\n\nthe [AEDPA] was enacted, and it is equally true, if not more so,\n\nunder the new act.\").\n\n          Neither of these categorical approaches is watertight.\n\nOn the one hand, the permissive approach taken by the Rodriguez\n\ncourt seems to elevate form over substance.                 In the process, it\n\nopens the door for easy subversion of the AEDPA's restrictions\n\n(and, thus, frustrates known congressional intent).                 On the other\n\nhand, the rigid rule adopted in cases such as Mobley and Felker\n\nseems to sweep too broadly.          That rule makes no allowance for\n\ncircumstances,   arising     in     the    course    of     a    federal    habeas\n\nproceeding, which might justify setting aside a judgment denying\n\nhabeas relief although not addressing the underlying criminal\n\nconviction. Mistake and fraud are examples of such a circumstance.\n\nSay, for instance, that a federal judge dismisses a habeas petition\n\nbecause the petitioner fails to respond to a show-cause order — and\n\na subsequent Rule 60(b) motion alleges that the show-cause order\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fwas never served on the petitioner.      Or say, for instance, that the\n\nfederal court bases an order of dismissal on the representations of\n\na state prosecutor — and a subsequent Rule 60(b) motion alleges\n\nthat the representations made to the habeas court were knowingly\n\nfalse.   In each situation, the motion challenges only the etiology\n\nof the habeas judgment itself.       Accordingly, it makes sense to\n\nconsider the motion as a Rule 60(b) motion simpliciter rather than\n\nas a second or successive habeas petition.\n\n            Given these concerns, we are reluctant to subscribe to a\n\n\"one size fits all\" taxonomy for the handling of Rule 60(b) motions\n\nin the habeas context.     The inquiry must proceed case by case.     The\n\ncourt must examine the factual predicate set forth in support of a\n\nparticular motion.       When the motion's factual predicate deals\n\nprimarily   with   the   constitutionality   of   the   underlying   state\n\nconviction or sentence, then the motion should be treated as a\n\nsecond or successive habeas petition.        This situation should be\n\ndistinguished from one in which the motion's factual predicate\n\ndeals primarily with some irregularity or procedural defect in the\n\nprocurement of the judgment denying habeas relief.           That is the\n\nclassic function of a Rule 60(b) motion, see, e.g., Teamsters,\n\nChauffeurs, Warehousemen & Helpers Union v. Superline Transp. Co.,\n\n953 F.2d 17, 19-20 (1st Cir. 1992), and such a motion should be\n\ntreated within the usual confines of Rule 60(b).\n\n\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\f          The approach that we favor is pragmatic in nature. Under\n\nit, the answer to the question of what law applies will depend not\n\non the label affixed to a particular motion but on its essence.\n\nThis approach is exemplified by the Seventh Circuit's opinion in\n\nDunlap v. Litscher, 301 F.3d 873 (7th Cir. 2002).       The Dunlap court\n\nwarned against permitting facile circumvention of the AEDPA's\n\nlimitations   on   successive   collateral   attacks    by   the   simple\n\nexpedient of characterizing a habeas petition as a motion under\n\nRule 60(b).   Id. at 875.   \"Otherwise, the AEDPA's limitations on\n\ncollateral attack would be set at naught.\"        Id.     But the court\n\nacknowledged that \"Rule 60(b) has a very broad scope and it is easy\n\nto imagine cases in which allowing a prisoner to file a motion\n\nunder it would pose no risk of conflict with the limitations that\n\nAEDPA places on successive collateral attacks . . . .\"       Id. at 875-\n\n76.   Thus, the court signaled that it would allow the use of Rule\n\n60(b) in habeas cases as long as a particular motion did not\n\nencroach upon \"territory occupied by AEDPA.\"      Id. at 876.\n\n           Other courts also have taken this approach (or variations\n\nof it).   See Thompson v. Calderon, 151 F.3d 918, 921 & n.3 (9th\n\nCir. 1998) (en banc) (acknowledging that a Rule 60(b) motion\n\nordinarily \"should be treated as a successive habeas petition,\" but\n\neschewing \"a bright line rule equating all Rule 60(b) motions with\n\nsuccessive habeas petitions\"); United States v. Rich, 141 F.3d 550,\n\n551 (5th Cir. 1998) (indicating a willingness to consider whether\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fa Rule 60(b) motion \"is the functional equivalent of a [habeas\n\npetition]\"); Hunt v. Nuth, 57 F.3d 1327, 1339 (4th Cir. 1995)\n\n(treating a Rule 60(b) motion as a successive habeas petition\n\nbecause the claims raised \"were equivalent to additional habeas\n\nclaims\"); Guinan v. Delo, 5 F.3d 313, 316 (8th Cir. 1993) (stating\n\nthat \"a Rule 60(b) motion seeking relief from the denial of a\n\nhabeas petition [is] properly treated as a second habeas petition,\"\n\nbut leaving open \"the possibility that a habeas case may present\n\ncircumstances in which a Rule 60(b) motion might properly be\n\nexamined as such\"); see also Mobley, 306 F.3d at 1101 (Tjoflat, J.,\n\ndissenting) (pointing out that \"a second or successive habeas\n\ncorpus petition . . . is meant to remedy constitutional violations\n\n. . . while a Rule 60(b) motion is designed to cure procedural\n\nviolations\").   We join with the overall approach of these courts\n\nand hold that a district judge should treat a Rule 60(b) motion in\n\na habeas case as a second or successive habeas petition whenever\n\nthe motion threatens to encroach upon precincts patrolled by the\n\nAEDPA, that is, whenever the factual predicate set forth in support\n\nof   the   motion   constitutes     a    direct   challenge   to   the\n\nconstitutionality of the underlying conviction.       In contrast, if\n\nthe factual predicate of the motion challenges only the procurement\n\nof the federal habeas judgment, it may be adjudicated under Rule\n\n60(b).\n\n\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\f          We do not pretend that this test will operate with\n\nmathematical precision. One can conjure up examples that defy easy\n\nplacement along the continuum that we envision.             But words have\n\ntheir limitations, and no bright-line rule can entirely capture the\n\nidea, reflected in our holding, that a Rule 60(b) motion should be\n\nconsidered    and   adjudicated   as   a   second   or   successive   habeas\n\npetition so long as it is the functional and practical equivalent\n\nof an application for habeas relief.        We are confident that, given\n\nthis general guidance, the district courts will be able to sift\n\nwheat from chaff without undue difficulty.\n\n                       B.   Applying the Holding.\n\n          We next apply this holding to the petitioner's motion.\n\nThat motion presents a direct challenge to the constitutionality of\n\nhis state court conviction.        It asks the district court for an\n\nopportunity to offer facts that (in the petitioner's view) will\n\nprove that his conviction was \"constitutionally infirm.\"              Such a\n\nclaim is a paradigmatic habeas claim. It is, therefore, subject to\n\nAEDPA's restrictions on the filing of second or successive habeas\n\npetitions, rather than to the conventional jurisprudence of Rule\n\n60(b).\n\n             In an effort to alter this conclusion, the petitioner\n\nargues that the evidence upon which he now relies was improperly\n\nwithheld during earlier proceedings (including the original habeas\n\nproceeding), thus constituting an \"ongoing fraud\" that challenges\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\fthe integrity of the habeas judgment itself.     This argument is\n\nclever, but flawed.   For one thing, it seeks to accomplish an end\n\nrun around the strict limitations that the AEDPA imposes upon the\n\nfiling of second or successive habeas petitions.        For another\n\nthing, it runs afoul of the law of the case doctrine.    After all,\n\nthe petitioner presented essentially the same material to this\n\ncourt in his unsuccessful effort to secure permission to file a\n\nsecond habeas petition.    We ruled then that the petitioner was\n\naware of much of the evidence in question at the time of his first\n\nhabeas petition yet \"fail[ed] to develop any argument that the\n\nremaining information was both unobtainable and probative.\"     The\n\nlaw of the case doctrine ordinarily calls for us to honor our\n\nprevious assessment, see Ellis v. United States, 313 F.3d 636, 646-\n\n47 (1st Cir. 2002), and there is no valid reason to do otherwise\n\nhere.\n\n          To cinch matters, the petitioner concedes that, on the\n\nrecord then before it, the district court committed no error in its\n\nhandling of the original habeas proceeding such as would undermine\n\nthe procurement of the judgment entered therein. The most that can\n\nbe said for his present position is that the district court, if it\n\nhad the benefit of a more elaborate presentation of the facts\n\nconcerning the Faustian bargain between Nagle and the prosecutor,\n\nwould have ruled differently in the habeas case and set aside the\n\n\n\n\n                               -14-\n\funderlying conviction.          So viewed, the motion before us is the\n\npractical equivalent of a second or successive habeas petition.\n\n          We    add     a   coda.       We    acknowledge       that,    despite      the\n\npetitioner's numerous attempts to expose the full extent of the\n\nrelationship between Nagle and the state prosecutor, no court has\n\nexhaustively     addressed       that        claim.      Some     of     these      lost\n\nopportunities may fairly be attributed to procedural errors on the\n\npetitioner's part.          Others, however, are linked to the stringent\n\nfilters that channel consideration of habeas corpus claims under\n\nthe AEDPA.     This regimen, though harsh, dovetails with Congress's\n\nintent.   See H.R. Rep. No. 104-23 (1995), 1995 WL 56412, at *8\n\n(explaining that the AEDPA is \"designed to curb the abuse of the\n\nhabeas corpus process, and particularly to address the problem of\n\ndelay and repetitive litigation\").              Section 2244(b)(3) establishes\n\na   rigorous   gatekeeping       arrangement          through    which       second    or\n\nsuccessive     habeas       applications       must    pass,     and    it    was     the\n\npetitioner's inability to open that gate that kept the district\n\ncourt from probing more deeply into the circumstances surrounding\n\nNagle's testimony.          This may seem overly restrictive — but any\n\ncomplaint about the inadequacy of the mechanisms available for\n\njudicial review in habeas cases ordinarily must be addressed to the\n\nCongress, not to the courts.            See Felker v. Turpin, 518 U.S. 651,\n\n664 (1996) (recognizing that \"judgments about the proper scope of\n\nthe [habeas] writ are normally for Congress to make\"); see also\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\fUnited States v. Victoria-Peguero, 920 F.2d 77, 81 (1st Cir. 1990)\n\n(stating this court's resolve to refrain from \"substitut[ing]\n\njudicial judgment for legislative judgment or . . . plac[ing]\n\nlimitations on [statutory language] which were not envisioned by\n\nCongress\").\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n            We need go no further.    We hold that the lower court\n\nappropriately treated the petitioner's Rule 60(b) motion as a\n\nsecond or successive habeas petition.   Therefore, the court had no\n\nchoice but to dismiss the motion for lack of subject matter\n\njurisdiction.   See 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b)(3).\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -16-\n\f",

There are three principal schools of thought on this controversial subject. Some courts have held that Rule 60(b) remains fully velivolant in the habeas context. Others have held that the restrictions imposed on the filing of second or successive applications for habeas relief by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-132, &#167;&#167; 101-107, 110 Stat. 1214, 1217-26 (codified as amended in 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2244, 2253-2255, 2261-2266 (2000)), make Rule 60(b) unavailable to habeas petitioners. A third camp consists of courts that, with slight variations, advocate a course somewhere between these extremes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We align ourselves with the third camp. AEDPA's restrictions on the filing of second or successive habeas petitions make it implausible to believe that Congress wanted Rule 60(b) to operate under full throttle in the habeas context. But even though state prisoners seeking habeas relief should not be able to use Rule 60(b) as a means of avoiding AEDPA's carefully calibrated limitations on habeas petitions, we see no justification for throwing out the baby with the bath water. Consequently, we hold that a Rule 60(b) motion should be treated as a second or successive habeas petition if &#8212; and only if &#8212; the factual predicate set forth in support of the motion constitutes a direct challenge to the constitutionality of the underlying conviction. In other cases &#8212; cases in which the factual predicate set forth in support of the motion attacks only the manner in which the earlier habeas judgment has been procured &#8212; the motion may be adjudicated under the jurisprudence of Rule 60(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the petitioner's Rule 60(b) motion is the functional equivalent of a new habeas petition. Because that triggers the AEDPA's requirements for second or successive habeas petitions, we affirm the district court's order of dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. TRAVEL OF THE CASE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since this appeal turns on a question of procedure, the travel of the case comprises the relevant background.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November of 1981, petitioner-appellant James J. Rodwell stood trial in a Massachusetts state court on a number of charges, including first degree murder, armed robbery, and unlawful carriage of a firearm. One of the key witnesses against him was a fellow inmate, David Nagle, who testified that, while awaiting trial, the petitioner had admitted to the murder and furnished many details. The jury found the petitioner guilty. The court thereafter imposed a mandatory term of life imprisonment on the murder charge and lesser sentences on the other counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1983, the petitioner filed an unsuccessful motion for a new trial. Two years later, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) affirmed both his conviction and the denial of his new trial motion. <i>See Commonwealth v. Rodwell,</i> 394 Mass. 694, 477 N.E.2d 385 (1985). The following year, the petitioner filed another unsuccessful motion for a new trial. This time, the SJC denied his application for further appellate review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having exhausted his state remedies, the petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. He named, as the respondent, a state correctional official.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> His petition alleged that Nagle was, in effect, an undercover government agent while he and the petitioner were incarcerated together; that Nagle's inquiries about the crime amounted to a post-indictment state interrogation without his lawyer present; that Nagle's testimony should have been excluded as procured in violation of the Sixth Amendment; and that, therefore, his conviction could not pass constitutional muster. The district court denied the petition. <i>Rodwell v. Fair,</i> No. 86-2455, slip op. (D.Mass. Apr. 13, 1987) (unpublished). We affirmed the denial, holding that the petitioner had not shown \"cause\" for failing to present evidence in support of his Sixth Amendment claim in the state court. <i>Rodwell v. Fair,</i> 834 F.2d 240, 241-42 (1st Cir.1987) (per curiam).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner was not deterred. Following a lull, he filed three more motions for a new trial in the state courts. Each of these was denied, and further appeals in the state system proved fruitless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At that juncture, the petitioner again eyed a federal forum &#8212; but an obstacle loomed. The AEDPA had taken effect and, under its terms, state prisoners cannot file second or successive federal habeas petitions as a matter of right. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(b)(3). Rather, a state prisoner who desires to file a second or successive habeas petition must secure pre-clearance from the court of appeals. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 2244(b)(3)(A). On October 4, 1999, the petitioner invoked this provision and requested permission to file a second habeas corpus petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A panel of this court carefully considered his application and concluded that the petitioner had failed to produce any new facts, sufficient to show his actual innocence clearly and convincingly, which could not have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence at or before the time when he filed his first federal habeas petition. <i>Rodwell v. Pepe,</i> No. 99-2109, slip op. at 1 (1st Cir. Nov. 4, 1999) (unpublished). Consequently, the panel refused the petitioner's request to file a second federal habeas petition. <i>Id.</i> Under the AEDPA, this decision was final and unappealable. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(b)(3)(E).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Attempting to find a crack in the wall that Congress had erected to guard against the profligate filing of successive applications for post-conviction relief, the petitioner repaired to the district court. On July 6, 2001, he filed a motion to reopen his original federal habeas case. Asserting that the prosecution had suppressed \"exculpatory evidence\" that shed doubt on Nagle's status and that \"it was not until well after his conviction, direct appeal and habeas denial that th[is] significant impeachment information was unearthed,\" he asked the district court to reverse its earlier denial of habeas relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, <i>Rodwell v. Pepe,</i> 183 F.Supp.2d 129, 133 (D.Mass.2001), reasonably construed the petitioner's motion as one brought pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> &#8212; a characterization that the petitioner enthusiastically embraced. Turning to the question of whether a Rule 60(b) motion seeking vacation of a judgment denying habeas relief should be treated as a second or successive habeas petition for AEDPA purposes, the district court answered that question affirmatively. <i>Id.</i> at 133-34. On that basis, the court ruled that it was without jurisdiction to hear the motion. <i>Id.</i> at 134-35 (citing 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(b)(3)). In a subsequent order, the court, recognizing that the pertinent authorities were in some disarray, granted a certificate of appealability (COA), <i>see</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253(c), thus allowing this appeal to proceed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The COA poses a single question: does a motion for relief presented pursuant to Rule 60(b) constitute a second or subsequent petition under the AEDPA? Despite its narrowness, this question has significant implications for habeas procedure &#8212; and the courts of appeals that heretofore have grappled with it have reached divergent conclusions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by addressing the certified question. After answering it, we proceed to apply the answer to the case at bar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Determining the Rule of Law.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As said, the decisions elsewhere have yielded three lines of cases. We turn first to the polar extremes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Second Circuit has ruled categorically that \"a motion under Rule 60(b) to vacate a judgment denying habeas is not a second or successive habeas petition and should therefore be treated as any other motion under Rule 60(b).\" <i>Rodriguez v. Mitchell,</i> 252 F.3d 191, 198 (2d Cir.2001). The court reasoned that a Rule 60(b) motion does not seek the relief requested by a habeas petition, but, rather, \"seeks only to vacate the federal court judgment dismissing the habeas petition.\" <i>Id.</i> That is \"merely a step along the way\" to habeas relief. <i>Id.</i> at 199. Consequently, affording Rule 60(b) its customary scope does not offend the AEDPA. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the other end of the spectrum, several courts have concluded that a Rule 60(b) motion in a habeas case must always be treated as a second or successive habeas petition under the AEDPA. <i>See, e.g., Mobley v. Head,</i> 306 F.3d 1096, 1096 (11th Cir.2002); <i>Lopez v. Douglas,</i> 141 F.3d 974, 975 (10th Cir.1998) (per curiam); <i>McQueen v. Scroggy,</i> 99 F.3d 1302, 1335 (6th Cir.1996). The Eleventh Circuit is the leading proponent of this proposition. In that court's view, according Rule 60(b) its customary scope in habeas cases would allow prisoners to cloak collateral attacks in the raiment of motions for relief from judgment under Rule 60(b) and thereby evade the limitations that Congress so painstakingly crafted in the AEDPA. <i>See Mobley,</i> 306 F.3d at 1096; <i>Felker v. Turpin,</i> 101 F.3d 657, 661 (11th Cir.1996) (per curiam). Based on this rationale, the court concluded that allowing habeas petitioners access to Rule 60(b) would contravene the very congressional intent that motivated passage of the AEDPA. <i>See Felker,</i> 101 F.3d at 661 (\"Rule 60(b) cannot be used to circumvent restraints on successive habeas petitions. That was true before the [AEDPA] was enacted, and it is equally true, if not more so, under the new act.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither of these categorical approaches is watertight. On the one hand, the permissive approach taken by the <i>Rodriguez</i> court seems to elevate form over substance. In the process, it opens the door for easy subversion of the AEDPA's restrictions (and, thus, frustrates known congressional intent). On the other hand, the rigid rule adopted in cases such as <i>Mobley</i> and <i>Felker</i> seems to sweep too broadly. That rule makes no allowance for circumstances, arising in the course of a federal habeas proceeding, which might justify setting aside a judgment denying habeas relief although not addressing the underlying criminal conviction. Mistake and fraud are examples of such a circumstance. Say, for instance, that a federal judge dismisses a habeas petition because the petitioner fails to respond to a show-cause order &#8212; and a subsequent Rule 60(b) motion alleges that the show-cause order was never served on the petitioner. Or say, for instance, that the federal court bases an order of dismissal on the representations of a state prosecutor &#8212; and a subsequent Rule 60(b) motion alleges that the representations made to the habeas court were knowingly false. In each situation, the motion challenges only the etiology of the habeas judgment itself. Accordingly, it makes sense to consider the motion as a Rule 60(b) motion simpliciter rather than as a second or successive habeas petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given these concerns, we are reluctant to subscribe to a \"one size fits all\" taxonomy for the handling of Rule 60(b) motions in the habeas context. The inquiry must proceed case by case. The court must examine the factual predicate set forth in support of a particular motion. When the motion's factual predicate deals primarily with the constitutionality of the underlying state conviction or sentence, then the motion should be treated as a second or successive habeas petition. This situation should be distinguished from one in which the motion's factual predicate deals primarily with some irregularity or procedural defect in the procurement of the judgment denying habeas relief. That is the classic function of a Rule 60(b) motion, <i>see, e.g., Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen &amp; Helpers Union v. Superline Transp. Co.,</i> 953 F.2d 17, 19-20 (1st Cir. 1992), and such a motion should be treated within the usual confines of Rule 60(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The approach that we favor is pragmatic in nature. Under it, the answer to the question of what law applies will depend not on the label affixed to a particular motion but on its essence. This approach is exemplified by the Seventh Circuit's opinion in <i>Dunlap v. Litscher,</i> 301 F.3d 873 (7th Cir.2002). The <i>Dunlap</i> court warned against permitting facile circumvention of the AEDPA's limitations on successive collateral attacks by the simple expedient of characterizing a habeas petition as a motion under Rule 60(b). <i>Id.</i> at 875. \"Otherwise, the AEDPA's limitations on collateral attack would be set at naught.\" <i>Id.</i> But the court acknowledged that \"Rule 60(b) has a very broad scope and it is easy to imagine cases in which allowing a prisoner to file a motion under it would pose no risk of conflict with the limitations that AEDPA places on successive collateral attacks....\" <i>Id.</i> at 875-76. Thus, the court signaled that it would allow the use of Rule 60(b) in habeas cases as long as a particular motion did not encroach upon \"territory occupied by AEDPA.\" <i>Id.</i> at 876.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other courts also have taken this approach (or variations of it). <i>See Thompson v. Calderon,</i> 151 F.3d 918, 921 &amp; n. 3 (9th Cir.1998) (en banc) (acknowledging that a Rule 60(b) motion ordinarily \"should be treated as a successive habeas petition,\" but eschewing \"a bright line rule equating all Rule 60(b) motions with successive habeas petitions\"); <i>United States v. Rich,</i> 141 F.3d 550, 551 (5th Cir.1998) (indicating a willingness to consider whether a Rule 60(b) motion \"is the functional equivalent of a [habeas petition]\"); <i>Hunt v. Nuth,</i> 57 F.3d 1327, 1339 (4th Cir.1995) (treating a Rule 60(b) motion as a successive habeas petition because the claims raised \"were equivalent to additional habeas claims\"); <i>Guinan v. Delo,</i> 5 F.3d 313, 316 (8th Cir. 1993) (stating that \"a Rule 60(b) motion seeking relief from the denial of a habeas petition [is] properly treated as a second habeas petition,\" but leaving open \"the possibility that a habeas case may present circumstances in which a Rule 60(b) motion might properly be examined as such\"); <i>see also Mobley,</i> 306 F.3d at 1101 (Tjoflat, J., dissenting) (pointing out that \"a second or successive habeas corpus petition ... is meant to remedy constitutional violations... while a Rule 60(b) motion is designed to cure procedural violations\"). We join with the overall approach of these courts and hold that a district judge should treat a Rule 60(b) motion in a habeas case as a second or successive habeas petition whenever the motion threatens to encroach upon precincts patrolled by the AEDPA, that is, whenever the factual predicate set forth in support of the motion constitutes a direct challenge to the constitutionality of the underlying conviction. In contrast, if the factual predicate of the motion challenges only the procurement of the federal habeas judgment, it may be adjudicated under Rule 60(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not pretend that this test will operate with mathematical precision. One can conjure up examples that defy easy placement along the continuum that we envision. But words have their limitations, and no bright-line rule can entirely capture the idea, reflected in our holding, that a Rule 60(b) motion should be considered and adjudicated as a second or successive habeas petition so long as it is the functional and practical equivalent of an application for habeas relief. We are confident that, given this general guidance, the district courts will be able to sift wheat from chaff without undue difficulty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Applying the Holding.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next apply this holding to the petitioner's motion. That motion presents a direct challenge to the constitutionality of his state court conviction. It asks the district court for an opportunity to offer facts that (in the petitioner's view) will prove that his conviction was \"constitutionally infirm.\" Such a claim is a paradigmatic habeas claim. It is, therefore, subject to AEDPA's restrictions on the filing of second or successive habeas petitions, rather than to the conventional jurisprudence of Rule 60(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to alter this conclusion, the petitioner argues that the evidence upon which he now relies was improperly withheld during earlier proceedings (including the original habeas proceeding), thus constituting an \"ongoing fraud\" that challenges the integrity of the habeas judgment itself. This argument is clever, but flawed. For one thing, it seeks to accomplish an end run around the strict limitations that the AEDPA imposes upon the filing of second or successive habeas petitions. For another thing, it runs afoul of the law of the case doctrine. After all, the petitioner presented essentially the same material to this court in his unsuccessful effort to secure permission to file a second habeas petition. We ruled then that the petitioner was aware of much of the evidence in question at the time of his first habeas petition yet \"fail[ed] to develop any argument that the remaining information was both unobtainable and probative.\" The law of the case doctrine ordinarily calls for us to honor our previous assessment, <i>see Ellis v. United States,</i> 313 F.3d 636, 646-47 (1st Cir.2002), and there is no valid reason to do otherwise here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To cinch matters, the petitioner concedes that, on the record then before it, the district court committed no error in its handling of the original habeas proceeding such as would undermine the procurement of the judgment entered therein. The most that can be said for his present position is that the district court, if it had the benefit of a more elaborate presentation of the facts concerning the Faustian bargain between Nagle and the prosecutor, would have ruled differently in the habeas case and set aside the underlying conviction. So viewed, the motion before us is the practical equivalent of a second or successive habeas petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add a coda. We acknowledge that, despite the petitioner's numerous attempts to expose the full extent of the relationship between Nagle and the state prosecutor, no court has exhaustively addressed that claim. Some of these lost opportunities may fairly be attributed to procedural errors on the petitioner's part. Others, however, are linked to the stringent filters that channel consideration of habeas corpus claims under the AEDPA. This regimen, though harsh, dovetails with Congress's intent. <i>See</i> H.R.Rep. No. 104-23 (1995), 1995 WL 56412, at *8 (explaining that the AEDPA is \"designed to curb the abuse of the habeas corpus process, and particularly to address the problem of delay and repetitive litigation\"). Section 2244(b)(3) establishes a rigorous gatekeeping arrangement through which second or successive habeas applications must pass, and it was the petitioner's inability to open that gate that kept the district court from probing more deeply into the circumstances surrounding Nagle's testimony. This may seem overly restrictive &#8212; but any complaint about the inadequacy of the mechanisms available for judicial review in habeas cases ordinarily must be addressed to the Congress, not to the courts. <i>See Felker v. Turpin,</i> 518 U.S. 651, 664, 116 S.Ct. 2333, 135 L.Ed.2d 827 (1996) (recognizing that \"judgments about the proper scope of the [habeas] writ are normally for Congress to make\"); <i>see also United States v. Victoria-Peguero,</i> 920 F.2d 77, 81 (1st Cir.1990) (stating this court's resolve to refrain from \"substitut[ing] judicial judgment for legislative judgment or ... plac[ing] limitations on [statutory language] which were not envisioned by Congress\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.

There are three principal schools of thought on this controversial subject. Some courts have held that Rule 60(b) remains fully velivolant in the habeas context. Others have held that the restrictions imposed on the filing of second or successive applications for habeas relief by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-132, &#167;&#167; 101-107, 110 Stat. 1214, 1217-26 (codified as amended in 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2244, 2253-2255, 2261-2266 (2000)), make Rule 60(b) unavailable to habeas petitioners. A third camp consists of courts that, with slight variations, advocate a course somewhere between these extremes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We align ourselves with the third camp. AEDPA's restrictions on the filing of second or successive habeas petitions make it implausible to believe that Congress wanted Rule 60(b) to operate under full throttle in the habeas context. But even though state prisoners seeking habeas relief should not be able to use Rule 60(b) as a means of avoiding AEDPA's carefully calibrated limitations on habeas petitions, we see no justification for throwing out the baby with the bath water. Consequently, we hold that a Rule 60(b) motion should be treated as a second or successive habeas petition if &#8212; and only if &#8212; the factual predicate set forth in support of the motion constitutes a direct challenge to the constitutionality of the underlying conviction. In other cases &#8212; cases in which the factual predicate set forth in support of the motion attacks only the manner in which the earlier habeas judgment has been procured &#8212; the motion may be adjudicated under the jurisprudence of Rule 60(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the petitioner's Rule 60(b) motion is the functional equivalent of a new habeas petition. Because that triggers the AEDPA's requirements for second or successive habeas petitions, we affirm the district court's order of dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. TRAVEL OF THE CASE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since this appeal turns on a question of procedure, the travel of the case comprises the relevant background.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November of 1981, petitioner-appellant James J. Rodwell stood trial in a Massachusetts state court on a number of charges, including first degree murder, armed robbery, and unlawful carriage of a firearm. One of the key witnesses against him was a fellow inmate, David Nagle, who testified that, while awaiting trial, the petitioner had admitted to the murder and furnished many details. The jury found the petitioner guilty. The court thereafter imposed a mandatory term of life imprisonment on the murder charge and lesser sentences on the other counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1983, the petitioner filed an unsuccessful motion for a new trial. Two years later, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) affirmed both his conviction and the denial of his new trial motion. <i>See Commonwealth v. Rodwell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2048561\"><a href=\"/opinion/2048561/commonwealth-v-rodwell/\"><span class=\"volume\">394</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">694</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2048561\"><a href=\"/opinion/2048561/commonwealth-v-rodwell/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">385</span></a></span> (1985). The following year, the petitioner filed another unsuccessful motion for a new trial. This time, the SJC denied his application for further appellate review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having exhausted his state remedies, the petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. He named, as the respondent, a state correctional official.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> His petition alleged that Nagle was, in effect, an undercover government agent while he and the petitioner were incarcerated together; that Nagle's inquiries about the crime amounted to a post-indictment state interrogation without his lawyer present; that Nagle's testimony should have been excluded as procured in violation of the Sixth Amendment; and that, therefore, his conviction could not pass constitutional muster. The district court denied the petition. <i>Rodwell v. Fair,</i> No. 86-2455, slip op. (D.Mass. Apr. 13, 1987) (unpublished). We affirmed the denial, holding that the petitioner had not shown \"cause\" for failing to present evidence in support of his Sixth Amendment claim in the state court. <i>Rodwell v. Fair,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"498119\"><a href=\"/opinion/498119/james-j-rodwell-v-michael-fair-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">834</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">240</span></a></span>, 241-42 (1st Cir.1987) (per curiam).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner was not deterred. Following a lull, he filed three more motions for a new trial in the state courts. Each of these was denied, and further appeals in the state system proved fruitless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At that juncture, the petitioner again eyed a federal forum &#8212; but an obstacle loomed. The AEDPA had taken effect and, under its terms, state prisoners cannot file second or successive federal habeas petitions as a matter of right. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(b)(3). Rather, a state prisoner who desires to file a second or successive habeas petition must secure pre-clearance from the court of appeals. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 2244(b)(3)(A). On October 4, 1999, the petitioner invoked this provision and requested permission to file a second habeas corpus petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A panel of this court carefully considered his application and concluded that the petitioner had failed to produce any new facts, sufficient to show his actual innocence clearly and convincingly, which could not have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence at or before the time when he filed his first federal habeas petition. <i>Rodwell v. Pepe,</i> No. 99-2109, slip op. at 1 (1st Cir. Nov. 4, 1999) (unpublished). Consequently, the panel refused the petitioner's request to file a second federal habeas petition. <i>Id.</i> Under the AEDPA, this decision was final and unappealable. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(b)(3)(E).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Attempting to find a crack in the wall that Congress had erected to guard against the profligate filing of successive applications for post-conviction relief, the petitioner repaired to the district court. On July 6, 2001, he filed a motion to reopen his original federal habeas case. Asserting that the prosecution had suppressed \"exculpatory evidence\" that shed doubt on Nagle's status and that \"it was not until well after his conviction, direct appeal and habeas denial that th[is] significant impeachment information was unearthed,\" he asked the district court to reverse its earlier denial of habeas relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, <i>Rodwell v. Pepe,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2285569\"><a href=\"/opinion/2285569/rodwell-v-pepe/\"><span class=\"volume\">183</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">129</span></a></span>, 133 (D.Mass.2001), reasonably construed the petitioner's motion as one brought pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> &#8212; a characterization that the petitioner enthusiastically embraced. Turning to the question of whether a Rule 60(b) motion seeking vacation of a judgment denying habeas relief should be treated as a second or successive habeas petition for AEDPA purposes, the district court answered that question affirmatively. <i>Id.</i> at 133-34. On that basis, the court ruled that it was without jurisdiction to hear the motion. <i>Id.</i> at 134-35 (citing 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(b)(3)). In a subsequent order, the court, recognizing that the pertinent authorities were in some disarray, granted a certificate of appealability (COA), <i>see</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253(c), thus allowing this appeal to proceed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The COA poses a single question: does a motion for relief presented pursuant to Rule 60(b) constitute a second or subsequent petition under the AEDPA? Despite its narrowness, this question has significant implications for habeas procedure &#8212; and the courts of appeals that heretofore have grappled with it have reached divergent conclusions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by addressing the certified question. After answering it, we proceed to apply the answer to the case at bar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Determining the Rule of Law.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As said, the decisions elsewhere have yielded three lines of cases. We turn first to the polar extremes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Second Circuit has ruled categorically that \"a motion under Rule 60(b) to vacate a judgment denying habeas is not a second or successive habeas petition and should therefore be treated as any other motion under Rule 60(b).\" <i>Rodriguez v. Mitchell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773518\"><a href=\"/opinion/773518/robert-rodriguez-v-robert-mitchell-superintendent-eastern-correctional/\"><span class=\"volume\">252</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">191</span></a></span>, 198 (2d Cir.2001). The court reasoned that a Rule 60(b) motion does not seek the relief requested by a habeas petition, but, rather, \"seeks only to vacate the federal court judgment dismissing the habeas petition.\" <i>Id.</i> That is \"merely a step along the way\" to habeas relief. <i>Id.</i> at 199. Consequently, affording Rule 60(b) its customary scope does not offend the AEDPA. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the other end of the spectrum, several courts have concluded that a Rule 60(b) motion in a habeas case must always be treated as a second or successive habeas petition under the AEDPA. <i>See, e.g., Mobley v. Head,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779416\"><a href=\"/opinion/779416/stephen-a-mobley-v-frederick-head-warden-georgia-diagnostic-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">306</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1096</span></a></span>, 1096 (11th Cir.2002); <i>Lopez v. Douglas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"753072\"><a href=\"/opinion/753072/alfonso-albert-lopez-v-peter-a-douglas-attorney-general-of-the-state-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">141</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">974</span></a></span>, 975 (10th Cir.1998) (per curiam); <i>McQueen v. Scroggy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"729638\"><a href=\"/opinion/729638/harold-mcqueen-jr-v-gene-scroggy-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1302</span></a></span>, 1335 (6th Cir.1996). The Eleventh Circuit is the leading proponent of this proposition. In that court's view, according Rule 60(b) its customary scope in habeas cases would allow prisoners to cloak collateral attacks in the raiment of motions for relief from judgment under Rule 60(b) and thereby evade the limitations that Congress so painstakingly crafted in the AEDPA. <i>See Mobley,</i> 306 F.3d at 1096; <i>Felker v. Turpin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"729999\"><a href=\"/opinion/729999/ellis-wayne-felker-v-tony-turpin-warden-georgia-diagnostic-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">657</span></a></span>, 661 (11th Cir.1996) (per curiam). Based on this rationale, the court concluded that allowing habeas petitioners access to Rule 60(b) would contravene the very congressional intent that motivated passage of the AEDPA. <i>See Felker,</i> 101 F.3d at 661 (\"Rule 60(b) cannot be used to circumvent restraints on successive habeas petitions. That was true before the [AEDPA] was enacted, and it is equally true, if not more so, under the new act.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither of these categorical approaches is watertight. On the one hand, the permissive approach taken by the <i>Rodriguez</i> court seems to elevate form over substance. In the process, it opens the door for easy subversion of the AEDPA's restrictions (and, thus, frustrates known congressional intent). On the other hand, the rigid rule adopted in cases such as <i>Mobley</i> and <i>Felker</i> seems to sweep too broadly. That rule makes no allowance for circumstances, arising in the course of a federal habeas proceeding, which might justify setting aside a judgment denying habeas relief although not addressing the underlying criminal conviction. Mistake and fraud are examples of such a circumstance. Say, for instance, that a federal judge dismisses a habeas petition because the petitioner fails to respond to a show-cause order &#8212; and a subsequent Rule 60(b) motion alleges that the show-cause order was never served on the petitioner. Or say, for instance, that the federal court bases an order of dismissal on the representations of a state prosecutor &#8212; and a subsequent Rule 60(b) motion alleges that the representations made to the habeas court were knowingly false. In each situation, the motion challenges only the etiology of the habeas judgment itself. Accordingly, it makes sense to consider the motion as a Rule 60(b) motion simpliciter rather than as a second or successive habeas petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given these concerns, we are reluctant to subscribe to a \"one size fits all\" taxonomy for the handling of Rule 60(b) motions in the habeas context. The inquiry must proceed case by case. The court must examine the factual predicate set forth in support of a particular motion. When the motion's factual predicate deals primarily with the constitutionality of the underlying state conviction or sentence, then the motion should be treated as a second or successive habeas petition. This situation should be distinguished from one in which the motion's factual predicate deals primarily with some irregularity or procedural defect in the procurement of the judgment denying habeas relief. That is the classic function of a Rule 60(b) motion, <i>see, e.g., Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen &amp; Helpers Union v. Superline Transp. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"575211\"><a href=\"/opinion/575211/teamsters-chauffeurs-warehousemen-and-helpers-union-local-no-59-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 19-20 (1st Cir. 1992), and such a motion should be treated within the usual confines of Rule 60(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The approach that we favor is pragmatic in nature. Under it, the answer to the question of what law applies will depend not on the label affixed to a particular motion but on its essence. This approach is exemplified by the Seventh Circuit's opinion in <i>Dunlap v. Litscher,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778932\"><a href=\"/opinion/778932/emmett-kapries-dunlap-v-jon-e-litscher-john-l-hunt-v-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">301</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">873</span></a></span> (7th Cir.2002). The <i>Dunlap</i> court warned against permitting facile circumvention of the AEDPA's limitations on successive collateral attacks by the simple expedient of characterizing a habeas petition as a motion under Rule 60(b). <i>Id.</i> at 875. \"Otherwise, the AEDPA's limitations on collateral attack would be set at naught.\" <i>Id.</i> But the court acknowledged that \"Rule 60(b) has a very broad scope and it is easy to imagine cases in which allowing a prisoner to file a motion under it would pose no risk of conflict with the limitations that AEDPA places on successive collateral attacks....\" <i>Id.</i> at 875-76. Thus, the court signaled that it would allow the use of Rule 60(b) in habeas cases as long as a particular motion did not encroach upon \"territory occupied by AEDPA.\" <i>Id.</i> at 876.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other courts also have taken this approach (or variations of it). <i>See Thompson v. Calderon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"756745\"><a href=\"/opinion/756745/98-cal-daily-op-serv-5653-98-cal-daily-op-serv-7641-98-daily/\"><span class=\"volume\">151</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">918</span></a></span>, 921 &amp; n. 3 (9th Cir.1998) (en banc) (acknowledging that a Rule 60(b) motion ordinarily \"should be treated as a successive habeas petition,\" but eschewing \"a bright line rule equating all Rule 60(b) motions with successive habeas petitions\"); <i>United States v.

Delo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"652973\"><a href=\"/opinion/652973/frank-j-guinan-v-paul-k-delo-superintendent-potosi-correctional-center/\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">313</span></a></span>, 316 (8th Cir. 1993) (stating that \"a Rule 60(b) motion seeking relief from the denial of a habeas petition [is] properly treated as a second habeas petition,\" but leaving open \"the possibility that a habeas case may present circumstances in which a Rule 60(b) motion might properly be examined as such\"); <i>see also Mobley,</i> 306 F.3d at 1101 (Tjoflat, J., dissenting) (pointing out that \"a second or successive habeas corpus petition ... is meant to remedy constitutional violations... while a Rule 60(b) motion is designed to cure procedural violations\"). We join with the overall approach of these courts and hold that a district judge should treat a Rule 60(b) motion in a habeas case as a second or successive habeas petition whenever the motion threatens to encroach upon precincts patrolled by the AEDPA, that is, whenever the factual predicate set forth in support of the motion constitutes a direct challenge to the constitutionality of the underlying conviction. In contrast, if the factual predicate of the motion challenges only the procurement of the federal habeas judgment, it may be adjudicated under Rule 60(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not pretend that this test will operate with mathematical precision. One can conjure up examples that defy easy placement along the continuum that we envision. But words have their limitations, and no bright-line rule can entirely capture the idea, reflected in our holding, that a Rule 60(b) motion should be considered and adjudicated as a second or successive habeas petition so long as it is the functional and practical equivalent of an application for habeas relief. We are confident that, given this general guidance, the district courts will be able to sift wheat from chaff without undue difficulty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Applying the Holding.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next apply this holding to the petitioner's motion. That motion presents a direct challenge to the constitutionality of his state court conviction. It asks the district court for an opportunity to offer facts that (in the petitioner's view) will prove that his conviction was \"constitutionally infirm.\" Such a claim is a paradigmatic habeas claim. It is, therefore, subject to AEDPA's restrictions on the filing of second or successive habeas petitions, rather than to the conventional jurisprudence of Rule 60(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to alter this conclusion, the petitioner argues that the evidence upon which he now relies was improperly withheld during earlier proceedings (including the original habeas proceeding), thus constituting an \"ongoing fraud\" that challenges the integrity of the habeas judgment itself. This argument is clever, but flawed. For one thing, it seeks to accomplish an end run around the strict limitations that the AEDPA imposes upon the filing of second or successive habeas petitions. For another thing, it runs afoul of the law of the case doctrine. After all, the petitioner presented essentially the same material to this court in his unsuccessful effort to secure permission to file a second habeas petition. We ruled then that the petitioner was aware of much of the evidence in question at the time of his first habeas petition yet \"fail[ed] to develop any argument that the remaining information was both unobtainable and probative.\" The law of the case doctrine ordinarily calls for us to honor our previous assessment, <i>see Ellis v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200248\"><a href=\"/opinion/200248/ellis-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">313</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">636</span></a></span>, 646-47 (1st Cir.2002), and there is no valid reason to do otherwise here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To cinch matters, the petitioner concedes that, on the record then before it, the district court committed no error in its handling of the original habeas proceeding such as would undermine the procurement of the judgment entered therein. The most that can be said for his present position is that the district court, if it had the benefit of a more elaborate presentation of the facts concerning the Faustian bargain between Nagle and the prosecutor, would have ruled differently in the habeas case and set aside the underlying conviction. So viewed, the motion before us is the practical equivalent of a second or successive habeas petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add a coda. We acknowledge that, despite the petitioner's numerous attempts to expose the full extent of the relationship between Nagle and the state prosecutor, no court has exhaustively addressed that claim. Some of these lost opportunities may fairly be attributed to procedural errors on the petitioner's part. Others, however, are linked to the stringent filters that channel consideration of habeas corpus claims under the AEDPA. This regimen, though harsh, dovetails with Congress's intent. <i>See</i> H.R.Rep. No. 104-23 (1995), <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">56412</span></span>, at *8 (explaining that the AEDPA is \"designed to curb the abuse of the habeas corpus process, and particularly to address the problem of delay and repetitive litigation\"). Section 2244(b)(3) establishes a rigorous gatekeeping arrangement through which second or successive habeas applications must pass, and it was the petitioner's inability to open that gate that kept the district court from probing more deeply into the circumstances surrounding Nagle's testimony. This may seem overly restrictive &#8212; but any complaint about the inadequacy of the mechanisms available for judicial review in habeas cases ordinarily must be addressed to the Congress, not to the courts. <i>See Felker v. Turpin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118058\"><a href=\"/opinion/118058/felker-v-turpin/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">651</span></a></span>, 664, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118058\"><a href=\"/opinion/118058/felker-v-turpin/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Victoria-Peguero,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552332\"><a href=\"/opinion/552332/united-states-v-pedro-r-victoria-peguero-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">77</span></a></span>, 81 (1st Cir.1990) (stating this court's resolve to refrain from \"substitut[ing] judicial judgment for legislative judgment or ... plac[ing] limitations on [statutory language] which were not envisioned by Congress\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. We hold that the lower court appropriately treated the petitioner's Rule 60(b) motion as a second or successive habeas petition. Therefore, the court had no choice but to dismiss the motion for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(b)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The original respondent, Michael Fair, is no longer in office.
