Petitioner Abraham Moses Asaba\n\n(\"Asaba\") appeals the Board of Immigration Appeals's (\"BIA\") April\n\n15, 2003 order denying his motion to reopen and rescind an in\n\nabsentia removal order entered by the Immigration Judge on May 21,\n\n1999.    We affirm.\n\n                            I.     Background\n\n             Asaba is a native and citizen of Uganda who entered the\n\nUnited States on or about March 27, 1996 as a non-immigrant visitor\n\nauthorized to remain in the United States for six months.           On June\n\n5,   1997,    the   Immigration   and   Naturalization   Service    (\"INS\")1\n\ncharged Asaba with removability under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1), as a\n\nnon-immigrant who had remained in the United States for a time\n\nlonger than permitted.       On January 28, 1998, Asaba, through his\n\ncounsel      Michael   Ozulumba   (\"Ozulumba\"),   admitted    the   factual\n\nallegations against him and conceded removability.           Asaba applied\n\nfor adjustment of status on the basis of his marriage to a United\n\nStates citizen whose relative visa petition was approved by the\n\nINS.    See 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i).    A hearing was eventually set for May\n\n21, 1999 at 2:00 p.m.\n\n             Asaba and his wife allegedly arrived at the Immigration\n\nCourt in Boston, Massachusetts, at noon on May 21, 1999 to meet\n\n\n1\n       In March 2003, the relevant functions of the INS were\ntransferred into the new Department of Homeland Security and\nreorganized into the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n(\"BICE\"). For simplicity, we refer to the agency throughout this\nopinion as the INS.\n\n                                    -2-\n\fOzulumba and prepare for the hearing.               They were unable to find\n\nOzulumba.     At 12:30 p.m., they called Ozulumba's office, obtained\n\nhis cellular phone number, and called him. Ozulumba allegedly told\n\nAsaba that he was ill and could not come to court.                 He told Asaba\n\nto go home and that everything would be \"okay.\"             Asaba and his wife\n\nthen left the Immigration Court.              At 2:04 p.m., Ozulumba went to\n\nthe clerk's office and filed a motion to continue the 2:00 p.m.\n\nhearing, stating that: (1) Ozulumba had been in court from 9:00\n\na.m. to 12:00 p.m. and, as a result, was unable to meet Asaba to\n\nprepare for the 2:00 p.m. hearing, and (2) Ozulumba was exhausted\n\nfrom a severe allergy attack and unable to attend the 2:00 p.m.\n\nhearing.2     At 4:15 p.m., Ozulumba spoke with the Immigration Judge,\n\nrestating the reasons for his failure to appear at the 2:00 p.m.\n\nhearing.\n\n              The Immigration Judge entered an order of removal in\n\nabsentia.      On August 30, 1999, Asaba, through Ozulumba, filed a\n\nmotion   to    reopen   and    for   stay      of   deportation,      asking    the\n\nImmigration     Judge   to    rescind   the    order   of   removal    issued    in\n\nabsentia so that Asaba could apply for asylum and withholding of\n\nremoval.      The motion stated that Asaba missed the May 21, 1999\n\nhearing because of \"extreme circumstances surrounding his [United\n\nStates] Citizen wife,\" and also mentioned that Ozulumba was sick on\n\n\n2\n    Ozulumba also used the incorrect alien number on the motion to\ncontinue, and attached a hearing notice with a different name and\nalien number than the motion to continue.\n\n                                        -3-\n\fMay 21.     No affidavits from Asaba or his wife were submitted with\n\nthe motion.     On September 29, 1999, the Immigration Judge denied\n\nthe motion to reopen, finding that Asaba failed to demonstrate any\n\nexceptional circumstances to excuse his failure to appear at the\n\nMay 21, 1999 hearing.        See 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i).3\n\n            Asaba received a copy of the Immigration Judge's decision\n\nfrom Ozulumba in October 1999.             This copy did not contain a\n\nparagraph in the original decision detailing Ozulumba's meeting\n\nwith the Immigration Judge at 4:15 p.m. on May 21, 1999.              Asaba\n\nappealed the Immigration Judge's decision to the BIA on October 29,\n\n1999.     Asaba argued to the BIA that, on the morning of May 21,\n\n1999, he learned for the first time that his wife had a court date\n\nelsewhere that morning.         Asaba's wife refused to disclose any\n\ndetails about the court date and told him to wait for her at the\n\nImmigration Court.     Asaba's wife never appeared at the Immigration\n\nCourt and Asaba had no way to contact her.            On January 23, 2001,\n\nthe   BIA   affirmed   the    decision   of   the   Immigration   Judge   and\n\ndismissed the appeal.\n\n             On May 31, 2001, Asaba discharged Ozulumba and retained\n\nnew counsel.     On June 1, 2001, Asaba filed a grievance against\n\nOzulumba with the Massachusetts Board of Bar Overseers (\"BBO\").\n\n\n3\n     8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i) states that an order of removal\nin absentia may be rescinded \"upon a motion to reopen filed within\n180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien\ndemonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional\ncircumstances (as defined in subsection (e)(1) of this section).\"\n\n                                     -4-\n\fThis grievance is still pending before the BBO.    On June 4, 2001,\n\nAsaba filed a second motion to reopen before the BIA, arguing that\n\nhe failed to attend the May 21, 1999 hearing because of ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel, and that ineffective assistance of counsel\n\nwas an \"exceptional circumstance\" as defined by 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1229a(e)(1).4    On April 15, 2003, the BIA denied the motion to\n\nreopen.   Asaba appeals the denial of the motion to reopen.5\n\n                          II.     Analysis\n\n          We review the BIA's denial of a motion to reopen for\n\nabuse of discretion.   See Betouche v. Ashcroft, 357 F.3d 147, 149-\n\n150 (1st Cir. 2004).    \"An abuse of discretion will be found where\n\nthe BIA misinterprets the law, or acts either arbitrarily or\n\ncapriciously.\"    Wang v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 25, 27 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n          The BIA denied Asaba's motion to reopen because (1) the\n\nmotion failed to comply with the procedural requirements set forth\n\nin Matter of Lozada, 19 I. & N. Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), and (2)\n\n\n\n4\n    8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1) states that \"[t]he term 'exceptional\ncircumstances' refers to exceptional circumstances (such as serious\nillness of the alien or serious illness or death of the spouse,\nchild, or parent of the alien, but not including less compelling\ncircumstances) beyond the control of the alien.\" The BIA has found\nthat ineffective assistance of counsel may qualify as an\nexceptional circumstance. See In re Grijalva-Barrera, 21 I. & N.\nDec. 472, 474 (BIA 1996); Saakian v. INS, 252 F.3d 21, 25 (1st Cir.\n2001).\n5\n    Asaba also filed a motion to reconsider before the BIA on May\n13, 2003.   On November 19, 2003, the BIA denied the motion to\nreconsider. Asaba did not appeal the BIA's denial of the motion to\nreconsider.\n\n                                 -5-\n\fthe BIA found that the motion was outside the 180-day limit\n\nprovided for in 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i).     We affirm because\n\nthe motion to reopen failed to comply with the Lozada requirements\n\nand need not reach the issue of timeliness.   See Betouche, 357 F.3d\n\nat 151 (finding that the BIA did not abuse its discretion where\n\npetitioner failed to comply with the Lozada requirements).\n\n          \"Given the sheer volume of ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel claims asserted by deportable aliens, the BIA has developed\n\nthreshold procedural requirements to enable the efficient screening\n\nof frivolous, collusive or dilatory claims.\" Wang, 367 F.3d at 27;\n\nsee Lozada, 19 I. & N. Dec. at 639.   In Lozada, the BIA stated that\n\na motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel\n\nshould be supported by:\n\n          (1) an affidavit describing in detail the\n          agreement between the alien and his counsel\n          regarding the litigation matters the attorney\n          was retained to address; (2) evidence that the\n          alien informed his counsel as to the alien's\n          ineffective    assistance   allegations    and\n          afforded counsel an opportunity to respond;\n          and (3) evidence that the alien had either\n          filed a complaint with the appropriate\n          disciplinary     authority    regarding    the\n          attorney's ethical or legal misfeasance, or a\n          valid excuse for failing to lodge such a\n          complaint.\n\nBetouche, 357 F.3d at 147; Lozada, 19 I. & N. Dec. at 639.   The BIA\n\nacts within its discretion in denying motions to reopen that fail\n\nto meet the Lozada requirements as long as it does so in a non-\n\n\n\n\n                               -6-\n\farbitrary manner.      See Saakian, 252 F.3d at 26; Betouche, 357 F.3d\n\nat 149 n.2.\n\n            The BIA emphasized that Asaba failed to submit evidence\n\nthat   he   notified   Ozulumba      of   the    allegations   of    ineffective\n\nassistance and afforded him an opportunity to respond.6                     Asaba\n\nfiled a complaint against Ozulumba with the BBO on June 1, 2001.\n\nOn June 4, 2001, Asaba filed a motion to reopen with the BIA.                   This\n\nmotion did     not   contain   any    evidence     that   Asaba     had   notified\n\nOzulumba of the allegations with the BBO.                 A supplement to the\n\nmotion to reopen, filed on August 13, 2002, also failed to provide\n\nany evidence that Asaba had notified Ozulumba of the allegations.\n\n            Asaba argues, based entirely on evidence he presented for\n\nthe first time in his motion to reconsider, filed on May 13, 2003,\n\nthat   he   provided   evidence      that   he    notified   Ozulumba      of    the\n\nallegations.     None of this evidence was properly before the BIA\n\nwhen it denied Asaba's motion to reopen on April 15, 2003.                   Asaba\n\nhas not appealed the BIA's denial of his motion to reconsider.\n\nBecause motions to reopen and motions to reconsider are appealed\n\n\n6\n      The BIA also found that Asaba failed to submit a separate\naffidavit describing in detail Asaba's agreement with Ozulumba\nregarding the litigation matters Ozulumba was to address. The BIA\nnoted, however, that \"it could be argued that the respondent\nsubstantially complied with the first Lozada requirement in that\nhis complaint is very detailed and could be considered an adequate\nsubstitute for a separate affidavit.\" Because we find that Asaba\nfailed to comply with the Lozada notification requirement and that\nthe BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to\nreopen on that ground, we do not reach the issue of whether Asaba\npresented an appropriate affidavit for Lozada purposes.\n\n                                      -7-\n\fseparately, see Zhang v. Ashcroft, 348 F.3d 289, 292 (1st Cir.\n\n2003); see also Stone v. INS, 514 U.S. 386, 405-406 (1995), the\n\nmotion to reconsider is not before us.                Therefore, the only\n\nevidence properly before us is the evidence that was in the record\n\nbefore the BIA when it denied Asaba's motion to reopen.                   See\n\nBetouche, 357 F.3d at 151 n.6; Fesseha v. Ashcroft, 333 F.3d 13, 18\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).         There is no evidence in the record that Asaba\n\nnotified      Ozulumba    of   the   ineffective    assistance   of   counsel\n\nallegations.\n\n              Even if Asaba had presented evidence that he notified\n\nOzulumba, he failed to meet Lozada's requirement that counsel be\n\nprovided an opportunity to respond before filing the motion to\n\nreopen.      See Lozada, 19 I. & N. Dec. at 639 (\"[B]efore allegations\n\nof ineffective assistance of former counsel are presented to the\n\n[BIA], former counsel must be informed of the allegations and\n\nallowed the opportunity to respond.\")(emphasis added). Asaba filed\n\nthe motion to reopen on June 4, 2001, three days after filing the\n\ngrievance with the BBO on June 1, 2001.            Even assuming that Asaba\n\nmailed Ozulumba notice of the allegations that same day, on June 1,\n\n2001, three days does not provide Ozulumba an \"adequate opportunity\n\nto respond\" to the allegations.          See Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d\n\n592,   599    (9th   Cir.   2004)(affirming   the    BIA's   decision   where\n\npetitioner did not prove that he gave former counsel \"notice of the\n\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fineffective assistance allegations or an adequate opportunity to\n\nrespond\").\n\n             Asaba's failure to meet the Lozada notice requirement is\n\nsignificant. The Lozada notice requirement provides a mechanism by\n\nwhich the Immigration Judge and the BIA \"may more accurately assess\n\nthe merits of a petitioner's ineffective assistance claim.\" Reyes,\n\n358 F.3d at 599.     \"The potential for abuse is apparent where no\n\nmechanism exists for allowing former counsel, whose integrity or\n\ncompetence is being impugned, to present his version of events if\n\nhe so chooses, thereby discouraging baseless allegations.\" Lozada,\n\n19 I. & N. Dec. at 639.     Asaba inexcusably failed to provide the\n\nBIA with evidence that he met the Lozada notice requirement,\n\ndespite having time and opportunity to do so.      We therefore find\n\nthat the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to\n\nreopen.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f",

On June 5, 1997, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\")<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> charged Asaba with removability under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227(a)(1), as a non-immigrant who had remained in the United States for a time longer than permitted. On January 28, 1998, Asaba, through his counsel Michael Ozulumba (\"Ozulumba\"), admitted the factual allegations against him and conceded removability. Asaba applied for adjustment of status on the basis of his marriage to a United States citizen whose relative visa petition was approved by the INS. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(i). A hearing was eventually set for May 21, 1999 at 2:00 p.m.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Asaba and his wife allegedly arrived at the Immigration Court in Boston, Massachusetts, at noon on May 21, 1999 to meet Ozulumba and prepare for the hearing. They were unable to find Ozulumba. At 12:30 p.m., they called Ozulumba's office, obtained his cellular phone number, and called him. Ozulumba allegedly told Asaba that he was ill and could not come to court. He told Asaba to go home and that everything would be \"okay.\" Asaba and his wife then left the Immigration Court. At 2:04 p.m., Ozulumba went to the clerk's office and filed a motion to continue the 2:00 p.m. hearing, stating that: (1) Ozulumba had been in court from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and, as a result, was unable to meet Asaba to prepare for the 2:00 p.m. hearing, and (2) Ozulumba was exhausted from a severe allergy attack and unable to attend the 2:00 p.m. hearing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> At 4:15 p.m., Ozulumba spoke with the Immigration Judge, restating the reasons for his failure to appear at the 2:00 p.m. hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Immigration Judge entered an order of removal <i>in absentia.</i> On August 30, 1999, Asaba, through Ozulumba, filed a motion to reopen and for stay of deportation, asking the Immigration Judge to rescind the order of removal issued <i>in absentia</i> so that Asaba could apply for asylum and withholding of removal. The motion stated that Asaba missed the May 21, 1999 hearing because of \"extreme circumstances surrounding his [United States] Citizen wife,\" and also mentioned that Ozulumba was sick on May 21. No affidavits from Asaba or his wife were submitted with the motion. On September 29, 1999, the Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen, finding that Asaba failed to demonstrate any exceptional circumstances to excuse his failure to appear at the May 21, 1999 hearing. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Asaba received a copy of the Immigration Judge's decision from Ozulumba in October 1999. This copy did not contain a paragraph in the original decision detailing Ozulumba's meeting with the Immigration Judge at 4:15 p.m. on May 21, 1999. Asaba appealed the Immigration Judge's decision to the BIA on October 29, 1999. Asaba argued to the BIA that, on the morning of May 21, 1999, he learned for the first time that his wife had a court date elsewhere that morning. Asaba's wife refused to disclose any details about the court date and told him to wait for her at the Immigration Court. Asaba's wife never appeared at the Immigration Court and Asaba had no way to contact her.
