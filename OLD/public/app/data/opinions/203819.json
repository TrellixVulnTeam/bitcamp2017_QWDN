Tabner for appellant.\n     Todd B. Gordon with whom Stephen F. Gordon and Gordon Haley\nLLP were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n                          May 15, 2009\n\f             Per Curiam.    In the district court, Steven Notinger, the\n\ntrustee in bankruptcy of David Deaver Brown and an affiliated\n\ncorporate debtor called Simply Media, Inc., sought to recover for\n\nthe estate allegedly fraudulent payments made by Simply Media to or\n\nfor Christina Brown--David Brown's wife--individually and in her\n\nrole as trustee of the First Marcus Trust.           In addition, Notinger\n\nsought damages for Christina Brown's participation in a civil\n\nconspiracy.\n\n             At trial,     there   was   evidence   from   Notinger and his\n\nwitnesses that David and Christina Brown had formed Simply Media,\n\na company making (or purporting to make) CDs, and had gotten\n\nfriends to invest in it based on fictitious financial statements\n\nand a compelling sales pitch; that the Browns used the invested\n\nfunds   to   pay   for   their   personal   expenses   over      several   years\n\nincluding the mortgage on their home, personal dry cleaning bills,\n\ncredit card bills, rent on their daughters' apartments, medical\n\nbills, vacation and school tuition; and that when the funds were\n\nexhausted, Simply Media and David Brown filed for bankruptcy.\n\n             Based on evidence received at a pre-trial hearing and\n\nChristina Brown's trial testimony when called by Notinger, the\n\ndistrict     judge   sanctioned     Christina   Brown      for    deliberately\n\ndestroying records by precluding her from testifying as to why the\n\ndiverted corporate funds constituted legitimate business expenses.\n\nA jury returned a verdict against Christina Brown of $1,103,508.60\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fon the fraudulent transfer claim and $2,968,071 (later reduced to\n\n$1,648,000) on the civil conspiracy claim.               Christina Brown now\n\nappeals,   raising   a    variety   of    arguments   of   which    three   are\n\nprominent and will serve as samples:\n\n                   •that positions taken by Notinger in\n            other litigation against former board members\n            of Simply Media, after the jury returned a\n            verdict in this case, were inconsistent with\n            his positions in this litigation;\n\n                   •that   the  New  Hampshire   Business\n            Corporation Act, N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 293-\n            A:1.01   et  seq.  (2009),   authorized   the\n            payments, which could be regarded as serving\n            business ends; and\n\n                   •that the spoliation sanction for\n            deliberate destruction of evidence imposed by\n            the district court was error.\n\n            We do not pass definitively on these or other arguments,\n\nbecause    Brown's   brief   does   not    properly   present      them.    The\n\ngoverning rule requires that an appellant's brief contain \"a\n\nstatement of facts relevant to the issues submitted for review with\n\nappropriate   references     to   the    record\"   and   an   argument     \"with\n\ncitations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the\n\nappellant relies.\"       Fed. R. App. P. 28(a)(7), (9).         Brown's brief\n\nfails to do either.\n\n            Although claiming that there are \"18 issues of material\n\nfacts\" that warrant revisiting the judgment, Brown's opening brief\n\ndoes not once cite the trial transcript; and the separate statement\n\nof facts in the brief is one paragraph long, with other factual\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fassertions merely scattered throughout the argument section.         The\n\nbrief is lengthy but much of the argument is very hard to follow.\n\nAlthough   many   of   the   arguments   inherently   depend   on   legal\n\npropositions, the brief cites only two cases.\n\n           Brown initially indicated on her transcript order form\n\nthat no transcript was necessary to our resolution of this case.\n\nAfter the briefing schedule was set--well after the ten day limit\n\nset by Fed. R. App. P. 10(b)--Brown's counsel ordered a transcript\n\nwhile continuing to claim that none was necessary.       Because of the\n\ndelay in ordering the transcript, Brown's brief was due before the\n\ntranscript was filed but seemingly Brown made no effort to obtain\n\nan extension so as to supply a brief with proper citations.\n\n           Neither does Brown's brief supply the information that\n\nwould be necessary to evaluate the claims.      Thus, while Notinger's\n\nposition in this case is alleged to be inconsistent with his\n\nposition in other litigation, the specific statements in each forum\n\nare neither quoted nor documented in Brown's opening brief, and in\n\nthe reply brief it becomes clear that the supposed inconsistency is\n\nimaginary.1   Nor is there any case law offered to show that\n\n\n\n     1\n      The belated documentation in the reply brief reveals that the\nclaim amounts to this: that Notinger's position at trial here was\nthat Simply Media was virtually a sham company, while in subsequent\nlitigation against the directors of Simply Media, Notinger claimed\ndamages against them for breach of fiduciary duty, alleging that\nSimply Media had claimed large assets, which \"had disappeared\nwithout a trace by the time Simply Media filed its bankruptcy\npetition.\"\n\n                                   -5-\n\fsupposed inconsistencies are automatically a basis for setting\n\naside a judgment on appeal in the absence of any post-judgment\n\neffort to do so in the district court.\n\n           Brown's   argument     under   the   New   Hampshire   Business\n\nCorporation Act seems to be that the types of expenses that Simply\n\nMedia paid on her behalf were permitted as valid expenses necessary\n\nto locate an office, maintain the health of officers, and so on.\n\nNo authority is offered to suggest that the statute allows a\n\ncorporation to pay personal expenses of the type and on the scale\n\nthat the evidence indicated in this case.        In Brown's reply brief,\n\nit is argued that Delaware law applied--an argument waived by\n\nfailing to make it in the opening brief.         VanHaaren v. State Farm\n\nMut. Auto. Ins. Co., 989 F.2d 1, 7 n.6 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n           As to the spoliation sanction, Brown says that it was\n\nunjustified because there was \"no evidence introduced of any single\n\ndocument   destroyed   or   any    required     document   not    available\n\nelsewhere.\"   The brief does not address or explain the extensive\n\nevidence, presented at the pre-trial hearing and through Brown's\n\nown testimony, supporting the district court finding that \"the\n\nBrowns had deliberately and systematically destroyed nearly every\n\nrelevant corporate document they ever received or generated.\"\n\n           Given the deficiencies of the brief and violations of\n\napplicable rules, we dismiss this appeal, as precedent permits,\n\nReyes-Garcia v. Rodriguez & Del Valle, Inc., 82 F.3d 11, 15-16 (1st\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fCir.   1996),   and   the   inadequacies   of   the   brief   require.   In\n\naddition, we direct Brown's counsel to show cause by written\n\nresponse within 14 days as to why the court should not order\n\npayment by him personally of attorney's fees and double costs for\n\nneedlessly consuming the time of the court and opposing counsel\n\nwith a brief that renders the appeal frivolous.           See Fed. R. App.\n\nP. 38; 1st Cir. R. 38.\n\n           It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f",
