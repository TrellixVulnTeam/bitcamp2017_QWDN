Patti B. Saris, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                       Lynch, Lipez and Howard,\n                           Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n      William Smith, Motion for Certificate of Appealability pro\nse.\n\n\n\n                           January 18, 2006\n\f          Per Curiam.        William Smith, who is serving a federal-\n\ncourt sentence for being a felon in possession of a firearm and\n\nammunition    in    violation      of   18    U.S.C.   §   922(g)(1),     seeks   a\n\ncertificate of appealability of the district court's dismissal of\n\nhis habeas corpus petition as untimely.            The sole issue he seeks to\n\nraise on appeal is whether the district court erred in concluding\n\nthat the one-year statute of limitations for filing a habeas\n\npetition under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 started to run when the Supreme\n\nCourt denied his petition for a writ of certiorari from this\n\ncourt's affirmance of his conviction and sentence on direct appeal.\n\nSmith argues that the limitations period did not begin to run until\n\nthe Supreme Court denied his petition for rehearing of the denial\n\nof certiorari and that his section 2255 petition, which was filed\n\nwithin one year after the denial of the petition for rehearing, was\n\ntherefore timely.\n\n          To       appeal   from    a   final    order     in    a   section   2255\n\nproceeding,    the     petitioner       must     obtain     a    certificate      of\n\nappealability.        28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(1)(B).                To obtain such a\n\ncertificate where, as here, the district court dismissed the\n\nsection 2255 petition on procedural grounds without reaching the\n\nmerits, the petitioner must show both that \"the soundness of the\n\nprocedural ruling is debatable, and . . . [that] the [underlying]\n\nconstitutional claim is also colorable.\"               Mateo v. United States,\n\n310 F.3d 39, 40 (2002) (citing Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473,\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\f484-85 (2000)).   Here, petitioner has made no effort to address\n\nthe merits of his constitutional claims, and the procedural issue\n\nis relatively easy to resolve, so we will turn to it first, as the\n\nSupreme Court has encouraged lower courts to do.    Slack, 529 U.S.\n\nat 485.\n\n          A one-year statute of limitations applies to petitions\n\nunder section 2255.    28 U.S.C. § 2255.   That period begins to run\n\nfrom the latest of several events, only one of which is relevant\n\nhere--\"the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final.\"\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2255(1).    Although the statute itself does not define\n\nwhen a conviction becomes final for this purpose, every circuit\n\nthat has addressed the issue has concluded that a conviction\n\nbecomes final--and the one-year period therefore starts to run--\n\nwhen a petition for certiorari is denied,1 Campa-Fabela v. United\n\nStates, 339 F.3d 993, 994 (8th Cir. 2003) (per curiam); United\n\nStates v. Hicks, 283 F.3d   380, 387 (D.C. Cir. 2002); United States\n\nv. Segers, 271 F.3d 181, 186 (4th Cir. 2001); Horton v. United\n\nStates, 244 F.3d 546, 551 (7th Cir. 2001); Washington v. United\n\nStates, 243 F.3d 1299, 1300-01 (11th Cir. 2001) (per curiam);\n\nUnited States v. Thomas, 203 F.3d 350, 356 (5th Cir. 2000); United\n\nStates v. Willis, 202 F.3d 1279, 1280 (10th Cir. 2000); Kapral v.\n\n\n\n     1\n      Where no petition for certiorari is filed, section 2255's\none-year limitation period starts to run when the time for seeking\ncertiorari expires.   Clay v. United States, 537 U.S. 522, 532\n(2003).\n\n                                 -3-\n\fUnited States, 166 F.3d 565, 570 (3rd Cir. 1999), rather than when\n\na petition for rehearing of the denial of certiorari is denied,\n\nGiesberg v. Cockrell, 288 F.3d 268, 270-71 (5th Cir. 2002) (per\n\ncuriam); Segers, 271 F.3d at 184-86.       See also Clay, 537 U.S. at\n\n539 n.4 (noting uniformity of the circuits on this issue).\n\n           In reaching that conclusion, our sister circuits have\n\nrelied on Supreme Court Rule 16.3, which provides that, absent a\n\ncourt order to the contrary, an order denying a petition for\n\ncertiorari \"will not be suspended pending disposition of a petition\n\nfor   rehearing.\"   Based   on   that   rule,   they   have   persuasively\n\nreasoned that a conviction becomes final for purposes of triggering\n\nthe one-year limitations period of section 2255 when certiorari is\n\ndenied, regardless of whether a petition for rehearing is filed or\n\nwhen such a petition is denied.    See Campa-Fabela, 339 F.3d at 994;\n\nSegers, 271 F.3d at 184-85; Giesberg, 288 F.3d at 271; Horton, 244\n\nF.3d at 551; Willis, 202 F.3d at 1280.          We agree and adopt the\n\nrule.\n\n           Petitioner argues that Supreme Court Rule 45, dealing\n\nwith issuance of mandates by the Supreme Court, dictates the\n\nopposite conclusion.    In particular, he relies on Rule 45.2's\n\nprovision that \"[t]he filing of a petition for rehearing stays the\n\nmandate until disposition of the petition, unless the court orders\n\notherwise.\"    That rule is inapt.        As recognized by the Fifth\n\nCircuit, Rule 45 \"refer[s] to the mandate and judgment that issues\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fafter a Supreme Court decision on the merits.           The denial of\n\ncertiorari review is governed[, instead,] by Supreme Court Rule\n\n16.3.\"   Thomas, 203 F.3d at 355.\n\n           Because the above reasoning and result are not reasonably\n\ndebatable,   we   deny   the   application   for   a   certificate   of\n\nappealability on the procedural issue without assessing the merits\n\nof petitioner's underlying constitutional claims.\n\n           The application for a certificate of appealability is\n\ndenied, and the appeal is terminated.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\f",

We agree and adopt the rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner argues that Supreme Court Rule 45, dealing with issuance of mandates by the Supreme Court, dictates the opposite conclusion. In particular, he relies on Rule 45.2's provision that \"[t]he filing of a petition for rehearing stays the mandate until disposition of the petition, unless the court orders otherwise.\" That rule is inapt. As recognized by the Fifth Circuit, Rule 45 \"refer[s] to the mandate and judgment that issues after a Supreme Court decision on the merits. The denial of certiorari review is governed[, instead,] by Supreme Court Rule 16.3.\" <i>Thomas,</i> 203 F.3d at 355.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the above reasoning and result are not reasonably debatable, we deny the application for a certificate of appealability on the procedural issue without assessing the merits of petitioner's underlying constitutional claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>The application for a certificate of appealability is denied, and the appeal is terminated.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Where no petition for certiorari is filed, section 2255's one-year limitation period starts to run when the time for seeking certiorari expires<i>Clay v.
