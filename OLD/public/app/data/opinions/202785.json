Petitioner, Zyber Nesimi (\"Nesimi\"), seeks\n\nreview of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\")\n\naffirming the decision of the Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") to deny\n\nNesimi's   application          for    asylum,    withholding    of   removal,   and\n\nprotection under the Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\").                   Finding\n\nno merit to Nesimi's arguments, we affirm the BIA's order and deny\n\nthe petition for review.\n\n                                           I.\n\n              Nesimi is a native and citizen of Albania who entered the\n\nUnited   States      on   May    20,    2003,     at   Miami,   Florida,   using   a\n\nfraudulent Italian passport.               Approximately one year after he\n\nentered the country, Nesimi filed an application for asylum with\n\nthe Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\").                     After Nesimi was\n\ninterviewed     by   an   asylum       officer,    the   DHS    referred   Nesimi's\n\napplication to the Immigration Court, which promptly placed Nesimi\n\nin removal proceedings by issuing him a notice to appear.                   Nesimi\n\nwas charged with being removable as an immigrant who did not\n\npossess a valid entry document at the time of admission.\n\n              At an initial hearing before the IJ, Nesimi conceded\n\nremovability as charged, renewed his application for asylum, and\n\nrequested withholding of removal, protection under CAT, and, in the\n\nalternative, voluntary departure.                After a merits hearing, the IJ\n\ndenied all of Nesimi's requests for relief.                Although the IJ found\n\nNesimi   to    be    generally        credible,    accepting     as   truthful   his\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\ftestimony about politically-motivated beatings and threats, she\n\nnonetheless found that Nesimi failed to establish either past\n\npersecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution sufficient\n\nto give rise to eligibility for asylum.            In     addition, the IJ\n\ndenied Nesimi's requests for withholding of removal and protection\n\nunder CAT.    The IJ also denied Nesimi's request for voluntary\n\ndeparture and ordered him removed to Albania, explaining that she\n\nlacked confidence that Nesimi would voluntarily depart based on his\n\nhistory of using elaborate and deceptive means to gain admission to\n\nthe United States.\n\n          The BIA dismissed Nesimi's appeal.            The BIA first found\n\nthat, even if the detentions and beatings experienced by Nesimi\n\nconstituted persecution on account of his political opinion, the\n\npresumption of a well-founded fear of persecution in the future was\n\nsatisfactorily rebutted under 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1)(i)(A) by\n\ndocumentary   evidence    demonstrating      a   fundamental    change   in\n\ncircumstances in Albania.         The BIA next found that the harm\n\nsuffered by Nesimi, even if persecutory, was not so severe as to\n\nconstitute    a      compelling     reason       under     8    C.F.R.    §\n\n1208.13(b)(1)(iii)(A) to grant asylum in the absence of a well-\n\nfounded fear of persecution.        The BIA further found that, by\n\nfailing to satisfy the lower burden of proof required for asylum,\n\nNesimi necessarily failed to satisfy the similar but higher burden\n\nof proof required for withholding of removal.             Finally, the BIA\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\ffound   that   Nesimi    failed    to    establish     eligibility       for    CAT\n\nprotection because he failed to demonstrate that it was more likely\n\nthan not that he would be tortured if removed to Albania.\n\n            In finding a change in circumstances in Albania, the BIA\n\nrelied on three documents issued by the United States Department of\n\nState: (1) Albania: Profile of Asylum Claims and Country Conditions\n\n(2004) (\"2004 Profile\"); (2) Albania: Country Reports on Human\n\nRights Practices—2002 (2003) (\"2002 Country Report\"); and (3)\n\nAlbania: Country Reports on Human Rights Practices—2003 (2004)\n\n(\"2003 Country Report\").           Together, these reports reveal that\n\npolitically-motivated       violence          in    Albania    has   decreased\n\nsignificantly in recent years.             The 2004 Profile, for example,\n\nstates:\n\n            [T]here have been no major outbreaks of\n            political violence since 1998, and the\n            available evidence suggests that neither the\n            Government nor the major political parties\n            engage in policies of abuse or coercion\n            against their political opponents.    Though\n            serious political repression existed in the\n            past, there are no indications of systemic\n            political persecution in Albania at the\n            present time.\n\n2004 Profile at 3.         The 2004 Profile also reveals that local\n\nelections in 2000 were carried out in a calm and orderly manner\n\nwith very few incidents of violence, that parliamentary elections\n\nin   2001   involved    isolated   cases      of   police   harassment    but    no\n\nsystemic or organized mistreatment, and that municipal elections in\n\n2003 \"were generally free of violence and considered the most\n\n                                        -4-\n\ftransparent in Albania's short democratic history, with no police\n\ninterference.\"      Id. at 5.     The 2002 and 2003 Country Reports paint\n\na similar picture of widely improving conditions, with no confirmed\n\ncases of detainees being held strictly for political reasons, no\n\nconfirmed cases of political killings by the Government or its\n\nagents, and no reports of politically-motivated disappearances.\n\n2002 Country Report at 2, 4; 2003 Country Report at 1, 2, 5.\n\n                                      II.\n\n            Our review, directed to the BIA's decision, is de novo on\n\nquestions    of     law   but   deferential   as   to    factual   findings.\n\nMukamusoni v. Ashcroft, 390 F.3d 110, 119 (1st Cir. 2004).              Under\n\nthe deferential standard, a reviewing court must accept the BIA's\n\nfactual findings if they are \"supported by reasonable, substantial,\n\nand probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\"              INS\n\nv. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992).            In effect, we will\n\nnot   set   aside   the   BIA's   factual   findings    unless   \"the   record\n\nevidence would compel a reasonable factfinder to make a contrary\n\ndetermination.\"      Guzman v. INS, 327 F.3d 11, 15 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\nThis deferential standard applies not only to asylum claims but\n\nalso to withholding of removal and CAT claims.                   Settenda v.\n\nAshcroft, 377 F.3d 89, 93 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n            An asylum applicant bears the burden of proving that he\n\nis unable or unwilling to return to his home country \"because of\n\npersecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\frace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social\n\ngroup, or political opinion.\"           8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A).        An\n\napplicant may meet this burden either by demonstrating a well-\n\nfounded fear of future persecution based on one of the five\n\nstatutory grounds, or by establishing that he has suffered past\n\npersecution,   in   which   case   he    is   entitled   to   a   rebuttable\n\npresumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution.1                 8\n\nC.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1).       If the presumption arises, the burden\n\nshifts to the DHS to prove either that \"[t]here has been a\n\nfundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant no\n\nlonger has a well-founded fear of persecution in the applicant's\n\ncountry of nationality\" or that \"the applicant could avoid future\n\npersecution by relocating to another part of the applicant's\n\ncountry of nationality.\" Id. at § 208.13(b)(1)(i)(A)-(B); see also\n\nOrelien v. Gonzales, 467 F.3d 67, 71 (1st Cir. 2006).             Here, based\n\nlargely on State Department reports of country conditions, the BIA\n\nfound that the record evidence demonstrated a fundamental change in\n\ncircumstances in Albania.\n\n          To reverse the BIA's factual finding regarding changed\n\ncircumstances, this court must find that a \"reasonable adjudicator\n\n\n\n     1\n      The BIA may also, in its discretion, grant asylum to an alien\nwho demonstrates \"compelling reasons for being unwilling or unable\nto return to the country arising out of the severity of the past\npersecution.\" 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1)(ii). The BIA in this case\ndenied such a discretionary grant of asylum, and that denial has\nnot been challenged by Nesimi.\n\n                                   -6-\n\fwould be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\"                         8 U.S.C. §\n\n1252(b)(4)(B); Tota v. Gonzales, 457 F.3d 161, 165 n.8 (1st Cir.\n\n2006) (noting that \"[f]indings as to changed circumstances are\n\nusually factual determinations\").                Unfortunately for Nesimi, the\n\nevidence in this case falls far short of compelling a conclusion\n\nthat country conditions in Albania have not undergone a fundamental\n\nchange since Nesimi left the country.\n\n            While not binding, State Department country reports and\n\nprofiles are \"generally probative of country conditions\" and may,\n\nin themselves, be sufficient to rebut the presumption of future\n\npersecution.    Chreng v. Gonzales, 471 F.3d 14, 22 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\nIndeed, in the case of Albania, this court has on a number of\n\noccasions    concluded      that     State   Department     reports    constituted\n\nsubstantial evidence supporting the BIA's conclusion that country\n\nconditions     in    Albania    had     improved     to    the   point    that    any\n\npresumption of a well-founded fear of future prosecution based on\n\npolitical opinion was successfully rebutted.                     See Alibeaj v.\n\nGonzales, 469 F.3d 188, 192 (1st Cir. 2006) (finding the State\n\nDepartment's        2003    Country    Report      sufficient     to     show     that\n\ncircumstances       had    changed    in   Albania   \"so    fundamentally        since\n\nAlibeaj left in 2001 as to obviate her otherwise well-founded fear\n\nof future persecution\"); Tota v. Gonzales, 457 F.3d at 167 (finding\n\nthe government's submission of the 2004 State Department Profile of\n\nAsylum Claims sufficient to rebut Albanian petitioner's presumptive\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\fwell-founded fear of future persecution); Bollanos v. Gonzales, 461\n\nF.3d 82, 86 (1st Cir. 2006) (upholding BIA's denial of asylum where\n\nBIA submitted the State Department's 2003 Country Report and 2004\n\nProfile to demonstrate changed circumstances in Albania).\n\n            Nesimi contends that the BIA erred by relying on the\n\nState   Department    reports    of    changed   country   conditions.        He\n\nsuggests that the country reports are general in nature and,\n\ntherefore, do not adequately rebut his own showing of \"specific\n\npersonal danger.\" He maintains that the BIA wrongly overlooked the\n\nState Department's conclusion that \"Albania remains a country with\n\na   high    degree   of    organized    crime,    corruption,     serious—but\n\ndeclining—problems        with   trafficking     in   persons,       and   often\n\ninadequate police protection for the vulnerable.\"            2004 Profile at\n\n3; see Bollanos, 461 F.3d at 86 (explaining that \"a high incidence\n\nof police misconduct, if not directed at a protected class of\n\npeople, does not prove eligibility for asylum\").                 He points to\n\nnothing, however, that would compel a finding that, with regard to\n\npolitical    repression,     country    conditions    in   Albania    have   not\n\nchanged for the better.\n\n            Although he has a wife, five sisters and three brothers\n\nwho continue to live in Albania, including a brother active in the\n\nsame political party with which Nesimi was involved, Nesimi offered\n\nno evidence that any of these individuals has been persecuted on\n\nprotected grounds since he left Albania in 2003.               He offered no\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fbackground materials to counter the information provided in the\n\nState Department reports, and he offered nothing to suggest that,\n\nat   the   present    time,   serious    political   repression    exists   in\n\nAlbania.\n\n            Because     substantial       evidence   supports      the    BIA's\n\nconclusion that, even if Nesimi suffered from past politically-\n\nmotivated persecution, any fear of future persecution is not well-\n\nfounded based on the changed conditions in Albania, we must affirm\n\nthe BIA's denial of Nesimi's asylum application.\n\n                                    III.\n\n            An   individual     seeking       protection   under    CAT   must\n\n\"establish that it is more likely than not that he or she would be\n\ntortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\"             8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1208.16(c)(2).      \"For an act to constitute torture . . . it must\n\nbe: (1) an act causing severe physical or mental pain or suffering;\n\n(2) intentionally inflicted; (3) for a proscribed purpose; (4) by\n\nor at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a\n\npublic official who has custody or physical control of the victim;\n\nand (5) not arising from lawful sanctions.\" Elien v. Ashcroft, 364\n\nF.3d 392, 298 (1st Cir. 2004); see also 8 C.F.R. 1208.18(a)(2)\n\n(providing that \"torture is an extreme form of cruel and inhuman\n\ntreatment and does not include lesser forms of cruel, inhuman or\n\ndegrading treatment or punishment that do not amount to torture\").\n\n            Nesimi contends that the BIA erred by failing to consider\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fhis CAT claim independently from his asylum and withholding claims.\n\nThe record, however, belies Nesimi's contention. While the BIA did\n\nnot elaborate on Nesimi's CAT claim, it specifically stated that\n\nthe claim was denied because Nesimi \"has not demonstrated that it\n\nis more likely than not that he would be tortured for any reason if\n\nremoved to Albania.\"   BIA Decision at 2.   The BIA thus used the\n\ncorrect more-likely-than-not standard for CAT claims, which is not\n\nthe same standard used for asylum or for withholding of removal\n\nclaims.   That the BIA did not elaborate about why it found that\n\nNesimi failed to make a more-likely-than-not showing of future\n\ntorture does not mean—as Nesimi suggests—that the BIA improperly\n\nconflated the different standards.\n\n                                IV.\n\n          Because we find that the BIA's conclusions were supported\n\nby substantial evidence, we AFFIRM the BIA's decision and DENY\n\nNesimi's petition for review.\n\n\n\n\n                                -10-\n\f",

The BIA first found\n\nthat, even if the detentions and beatings experienced by Nesimi\n\nconstituted persecution on account of his political opinion, the\n\npresumption of a well-founded fear of persecution in the future was\n\nsatisfactorily rebutted under 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1)(i)(A) by\n\ndocumentary   evidence    demonstrating      a   fundamental    change   in\n\ncircumstances in Albania.         The BIA next found that the harm\n\nsuffered by Nesimi, even if persecutory, was not so severe as to\n\nconstitute    a      compelling     reason       under     8    C.F.R.    §\n\n1208.13(b)(1)(iii)(A) to grant asylum in the absence of a well-\n\nfounded fear of persecution.        The BIA further found that, by\n\nfailing to satisfy the lower burden of proof required for asylum,\n\nNesimi necessarily failed to satisfy the similar but higher burden\n\nof proof required for withholding of removal.             Finally, the BIA\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\ffound   that   Nesimi    failed    to    establish     eligibility       for    CAT\n\nprotection because he failed to demonstrate that it was more likely\n\nthan not that he would be tortured if removed to Albania.\n\n            In finding a change in circumstances in Albania, the BIA\n\nrelied on three documents issued by the United States Department of\n\nState: (1) Albania: Profile of Asylum Claims and Country Conditions\n\n(2004) (\"2004 Profile\"); (2) Albania: Country Reports on Human\n\nRights Practices—2002 (2003) (\"2002 Country Report\"); and (3)\n\nAlbania: Country Reports on Human Rights Practices—2003 (2004)\n\n(\"2003 Country Report\").           Together, these reports reveal that\n\npolitically-motivated       violence          in    Albania    has   decreased\n\nsignificantly in recent years.             The 2004 Profile, for example,\n\nstates:\n\n            [T]here have been no major outbreaks of\n            political violence since 1998, and the\n            available evidence suggests that neither the\n            Government nor the major political parties\n            engage in policies of abuse or coercion\n            against their political opponents.    Though\n            serious political repression existed in the\n            past, there are no indications of systemic\n            political persecution in Albania at the\n            present time.\n\n2004 Profile at 3.         The 2004 Profile also reveals that local\n\nelections in 2000 were carried out in a calm and orderly manner\n\nwith very few incidents of violence, that parliamentary elections\n\nin   2001   involved    isolated   cases      of   police   harassment    but    no\n\nsystemic or organized mistreatment, and that municipal elections in\n\n2003 \"were generally free of violence and considered the most\n\n                                        -4-\n\ftransparent in Albania's short democratic history, with no police\n\ninterference.\"      Id. at 5.     The 2002 and 2003 Country Reports paint\n\na similar picture of widely improving conditions, with no confirmed\n\ncases of detainees being held strictly for political reasons, no\n\nconfirmed cases of political killings by the Government or its\n\nagents, and no reports of politically-motivated disappearances.\n\n2002 Country Report at 2, 4; 2003 Country Report at 1, 2, 5.\n\n                                      II.\n\n            Our review, directed to the BIA's decision, is de novo on\n\nquestions    of     law   but   deferential   as   to    factual   findings.\n\nMukamusoni v.

He\n\nsuggests that the country reports are general in nature and,\n\ntherefore, do not adequately rebut his own showing of \"specific\n\npersonal danger.\" He maintains that the BIA wrongly overlooked the\n\nState Department's conclusion that \"Albania remains a country with\n\na   high    degree   of    organized    crime,    corruption,     serious—but\n\ndeclining—problems        with   trafficking     in   persons,       and   often\n\ninadequate police protection for the vulnerable.\"            2004 Profile at\n\n3; see Bollanos, 461 F.3d at 86 (explaining that \"a high incidence\n\nof police misconduct, if not directed at a protected class of\n\npeople, does not prove eligibility for asylum\").                 He points to\n\nnothing, however, that would compel a finding that, with regard to\n\npolitical    repression,     country    conditions    in   Albania    have   not\n\nchanged for the better.\n\n            Although he has a wife, five sisters and three brothers\n\nwho continue to live in Albania, including a brother active in the\n\nsame political party with which Nesimi was involved, Nesimi offered\n\nno evidence that any of these individuals has been persecuted on\n\nprotected grounds since he left Albania in 2003.               He offered no\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fbackground materials to counter the information provided in the\n\nState Department reports, and he offered nothing to suggest that,\n\nat   the   present    time,   serious    political   repression    exists   in\n\nAlbania.\n\n            Because     substantial       evidence   supports      the    BIA's\n\nconclusion that, even if Nesimi suffered from past politically-\n\nmotivated persecution, any fear of future persecution is not well-\n\nfounded based on the changed conditions in Albania, we must affirm\n\nthe BIA's denial of Nesimi's asylum application.\n\n                                    III.\n\n            An   individual     seeking       protection   under    CAT   must\n\n\"establish that it is more likely than not that he or she would be\n\ntortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\"             8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1208.16(c)(2).      \"For an act to constitute torture . . . it must\n\nbe: (1) an act causing severe physical or mental pain or suffering;\n\n(2) intentionally inflicted; (3) for a proscribed purpose; (4) by\n\nor at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a\n\npublic official who has custody or physical control of the victim;\n\nand (5) not arising from lawful sanctions.\" Elien v.
