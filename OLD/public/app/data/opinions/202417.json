The petitioner, Alvaro Salim\n\nSilva, a native and citizen of Colombia, seeks review of the denial\n\nof his application for asylum and withholding of removal.                     An\n\nImmigration       Judge    (IJ)    found    Silva's    application   for   asylum\n\npretermitted, and also concluded that Silva failed to carry the\n\nburden of proof with respect to his withholding of removal claim.\n\nThe Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) adopted and affirmed the\n\nIJ's decision.      We affirm the BIA and deny the petition for review.\n\n                                           I.\n\n            Silva lawfully entered the United States on February 7,\n\n2000.   As a non-immigrant F-1 student, he was authorized to remain\n\nfor the duration of his status.                  However, starting on or about\n\nDecember    23,    2000,    Silva    stopped      attending   Massachusetts   Bay\n\nCommunity College.\n\n            On February 12, 2002, Silva filed an application for\n\nasylum and withholding of removal.                  In his application, Silva\n\ndescribed various incidents of intimidation in his home country of\n\nColombia.     Silva recounted how, in August 1997, the guerrilla\n\norganization known as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia\n\n(FARC) bombed one of his family's properties in retaliation for\n\ntheir political views.            He also noted how his support of a \"youth\n\ngroup\" whose \"purpose was to orientate and guide . . . kids\"\n\nangered the FARC because it made it difficult for the guerrillas to\n\nrecruit new members.          According to Silva, in June 1998, a FARC\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\fcommandant visited the family hacienda in Cumaral and spoke with\n\nthe foreman about the family's political activities, suggesting\n\nthat the family should leave the country.   The family at that point\n\nmoved to Bogota \"to protect [their] lives.\" Silva reported that in\n\nSeptember of the same year, the FARC paid another visit to the\n\nhacienda, this time to express displeasure at the Silvas' failure\n\nto leave Colombia.   The next day, five dead cows were found on the\n\nfarm with the initials of the FARC written over the animals'\n\ncarcasses.   After this incident, Silva's parents asked Silva and\n\nthe older of his two sisters to move to the United States, and on\n\nSeptember 9, 1998, they did so.\n\n          In December 1999, Silva returned to Colombia, hoping that\n\na recent \"peace amnesty\" had changed the situation there. However,\n\nSilva noted that guerrillas \"tried to take over [his] town\" on\n\nJanuary 10, 2000, and that this prompted his final return to the\n\nUnited States on February 7, 2000.      In his asylum application,\n\nSilva conceded that he was filing more than one year after his last\n\nentry into the United States, but he explained that he \"didn't know\n\nabout the regulation of the law about this matter.\"\n\n          On October 23, 2002, the Immigration and Naturalization\n\nService (INS)1 initiated removal proceedings against Silva for\n\n\n\n     1\n          On March 1, 2003, the functions of the INS were\ntransferred to the Department of Homeland Security. See Homeland\nSecurity Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, § 471(a), 116 Stat.\n2135, 2205 (codified at 6 U.S.C. § 291(a)).\n\n                                  -3-\n\ffailing to maintain his non-immigrant F-1 student status.                Silva\n\nadmitted the factual allegations in the government's amended Notice\n\nto Appear. He also applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and\n\nprotection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT), or, in the\n\nalternative, voluntary departure.\n\n            At the removal hearing on July 9, 2004, Silva testified\n\nto many of the same incidents listed in his original application\n\nfor asylum.       When asked why he waited just over two years after\n\nlast entering the United States to apply for asylum, Silva stated,\n\n\"I never thought that I was going to end up staying here.               Things\n\ngot worse and worse and that was my only choice.\"                Silva further\n\nexplained: \"[P]eople [are] getting killed by[] the guerrillas all\n\nover the place.       They are all over the country.           You do not know\n\nwhere they actually are.       They can just come out, out of the blue,\n\nand kill you for no reason.\"      Silva's brother also testified at the\n\nhearing as to the events of June 1998.\n\n            In an oral opinion, the IJ denied Silva's application for\n\nasylum on grounds that he had failed to apply for asylum within one\n\nyear after the date of his arrival in the United States, and had\n\nfailed to establish either changed or extraordinary circumstances.\n\nThe   IJ   next   rejected    Silva's    application    for    withholding   of\n\nremoval,    finding    that   Silva     had   not   suffered   persecution   in\n\nColombia, and noting in passing that the hearsay testimony about\n\n\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fthe    five   slain   cows2   was    \"the    kind    of   thing    that   could   be\n\nsubstantiated by photographs if it had occurred.\"                     The IJ also\n\ndenied the request for relief under the CAT, observing that Silva\n\nhad not established fear of torture by, at the instigation of, or\n\nwith the acquiescence of Colombian officials. The IJ did, however,\n\ngrant Silva's application for voluntary departure.\n\n              Silva timely appealed the denial of his asylum and\n\nwithholding of removal claims.3             The BIA adopted and affirmed the\n\nIJ's decision, noting briefly that Silva's \"failure to produce\n\nphotographic evidence . . . [was] not, in itself, fatal to his\n\nclaim,\" but ultimately agreeing with the IJ that Silva failed to\n\nmeet his burden of proof for withholding of removal.                  Silva timely\n\npetitioned for review by this court.\n\n                                       II.\n\n              Silva raises three claims on appeal.                First, he argues\n\nthat the IJ erred in finding his asylum application pretermitted.\n\nSecond, he argues that the IJ erred in finding that he did not\n\nsuffer past persecution. Third, he argues that the IJ violated his\n\ndue    process    rights      by    requiring       photographic     evidence     to\n\ncorroborate his testimony.          We address each claim in turn.\n\n\n\n       2\n          At the hearing, Silva testified that he did not see the\ncows himself. The foreman had called Silva's father to report the\nnews.\n       3\n              Silva did not appeal the IJ's denial of relief under the\nCAT.\n\n                                       -5-\n\fA.        Asylum\n\n          In   order   to   qualify   for   asylum,   an   applicant   must\n\nestablish that he is a \"refugee.\"       See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(A);\n\n8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(a).       A refugee is someone who is unable or\n\nunwilling to return to his home country due to persecution or a\n\nwell-founded fear of future persecution \"on account of race,\n\nreligion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or\n\npolitical opinion.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A); see also Rodriguez-\n\nRamirez v. Ashcroft, 398 F.3d 120, 124 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n          Furthermore, an alien must \"demonstrate[] by clear and\n\nconvincing evidence that the application [was] filed within 1 year\n\nafter the date of the alien's arrival in the United States.\"\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B).     If the one-year filing deadline is not\n\nsatisfied, \"the government may consider an application only if 'the\n\nalien demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Attorney General\n\neither the existence of changed circumstances which materially\n\naffect the applicant's eligibility for asylum or extraordinary\n\ncircumstances relating to the delay in filing an application.'\"\n\nSharari v. Gonzáles, 407 F.3d 467, 472 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(D)).\n\n          Silva did not file his application for asylum until\n\nFebruary 12, 2002, more than two years after his last entry into\n\nthe United States on February 7, 2000.      Silva does not dispute this\n\n\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\ffact, but rather argues that changed circumstances excuse his late\n\nfiling.\n\n            Fatal to Silva's argument, however, is our lack of\n\njurisdiction to review determinations of this nature.       8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1158(a)(3) states that \"[n]o court shall have jurisdiction to\n\nreview any determination of the Attorney General under paragraph\n\n(2).\"     Paragraph (2) of § 1158(a), in turn, addresses both the\n\ntimeliness of asylum applications and the existence of changed or\n\nextraordinary circumstances that may excuse failures to file within\n\none year.    Id. § 1158(a)(2); see also Sharari, 407 F.3d at 473;\n\nNjenga v. Ashcroft, 386 F.3d 335, 339 (1st Cir. 2004); Haoud v.\n\nAshcroft, 350 F.3d 201, 204-05 (1st Cir. 2003).   Here, the IJ found\n\nthat Silva's asylum application was untimely; he also found that\n\nSilva failed to demonstrate changed circumstances.     Because these\n\ndeterminations fall within the ambit of 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2), we\n\nhave no jurisdiction to review the matter.\n\nB.          Past Persecution\n\n            To obtain withholding of removal, an applicant must prove\n\nthat upon return to his home country, \"he is more likely than not\n\nto face persecution on account of race, religion, nationality,\n\nmembership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\"\n\nSee Salazar v. Ashcroft, 359 F.3d 45, 52 (1st Cir. 2004) (emphasis\n\nomitted).    We have previously stated that \"persecution encompasses\n\nmore than threats to life or freedom, but less than mere harassment\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\for annoyance.\"       Aguilar-Solis v. INS, 168 F.3d 565, 570 (1st Cir.\n\n1999) (citations omitted).\n\n             Silva   argues    that   the    IJ    erred   in    finding    no     past\n\npersecution.         We   review      factual      findings      and   credibility\n\ndeterminations under the deferential substantial evidence standard\n\nof review.    INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992); Singh\n\nv. Gonzales, 413 F.3d 156, 159 (1st Cir. 2005).                 We must uphold the\n\nBIA's   decision     \"unless    any    reasonable      adjudicator         would    be\n\ncompelled to conclude to the contrary.\"              8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B).\n\n             However, we may review a final order of the BIA only if\n\n\"the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to\n\nthe alien as of right.\"        Id. § 1252(d)(1).       Under the exhaustion of\n\nremedies doctrine, theories insufficiently developed before the BIA\n\nmay not be raised before this court.              See Olujoke v. Gonzáles, 411\n\nF.3d 16, 22-23 (1st Cir. 2005); Makhoul v. Ashcroft, 387 F.3d 75,\n\n80 (1st Cir. 2004).           Silva is barred from advancing his past\n\npersecution claim.        Although he included in his BIA appeal a\n\nheading titled, \"The IJ erred in finding that respondent had not\n\nsuffered past persecution in Colombia,\" Silva failed to put forward\n\na developed argument along these lines.               Instead, he focused the\n\nBIA's attention on the IJ's statement that the testimony about the\n\nfive slain cows could have been corroborated with photographic\n\nevidence.    Silva's narrow argument in his appeal to the BIA is not\n\nsufficient to allow a broader inquiry now into the IJ's factual\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fdetermination that Silva did not suffer past persecution.                 In any\n\nevent, even if we were to reach the merits of Silva's claim, he\n\nwould not prevail under the substantial evidence standard of\n\nreview.\n\nC.          Due Process\n\n            Silva argues that his due process rights were violated\n\nbecause the IJ placed \"unreasonable demands\" on him to \"corroborate\n\nparticular experiences.\"          In essence, Silva reasserts his claim\n\nthat the IJ erroneously discounted testimony about the five cows\n\nkilled on his family's hacienda.\n\n            Again,   we   review     factual    findings     and    credibility\n\ndeterminations under the substantial evidence test.                   See Elias-\n\nZacarias, 502 U.S. at 481; Singh, 413 F.3d at 159.            With respect to\n\nthe slain cows, the IJ stated that Silva's and his brother's\n\ntestimony   was   \"unconvincing\"      because    it    was   \"based    upon   the\n\nstatement of a FARC guerrilla to a foreman of [Silva's] father's\n\nranch, the statement then of the foreman of the ranch to the\n\nrespondent's father and then the statement of [Silva's] father to\n\n[Silva].\"     The    IJ   noted    that,    although   hearsay     evidence    is\n\nadmissible in immigration hearings, \"this sort of triple hearsay\n\nevidence is not very probative and is unreliable.\"                 Furthermore,\n\nthe IJ observed that Silva's father, mother, and younger sister all\n\ncontinued to live unharmed on the family's properties in Colombia.\n\nThe IJ also thought it was curious that Silva claimed to be afraid\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fto return to Colombia ever since his last entry into the United\n\nStates on February 7, 2000, even though his older sister, who was\n\nsubject to similar treatment by the FARC, \"returned to Colombia in\n\nNovember of 2000 and then again at some point in time in 2001\n\naccording to the testimony of [Silva's] brother.\"\n\n          Based   on   these   observations,   the   IJ   discounted   the\n\ntestimony regarding the slain cows and ultimately did not find that\n\nSilva had suffered persecution in Colombia.      The BIA affirmed this\n\ndecision, noting that even without considering the absence of\n\nphotographic evidence, Silva failed to meet his burden of proof.\n\nWe cannot say that \"any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled\n\nto conclude to the contrary.\"     8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B); see also\n\nRodriguez-Ramirez, 398 F.3d at 123.\n\n          The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\f",

Instead, he focused the BIA's attention on the IJ's statement that the testimony about the five slain cows could have been corroborated with photographic evidence. Silva's narrow argument in his appeal to the BIA is not sufficient to allow a broader inquiry now into the IJ's factual determination that Silva did not suffer past persecution.

With respect to the slain cows, the IJ stated that Silva's and his brother's testimony was \"unconvincing\" because it was \"based upon the statement of a FARC guerrilla to a foreman of [Silva's] father's ranch, the statement then of the foreman of the ranch to the respondent's father and then the statement of [Silva's] father to [Silva].\" The IJ noted that, although hearsay evidence is admissible in immigration hearings, \"this sort of triple hearsay evidence is not very probative and is unreliable.\" Furthermore, the IJ observed that Silva's father, mother, and younger sister all continued to live unharmed on the family's properties in Colombia. The IJ also thought it was curious that Silva claimed to be afraid to return to Colombia ever since his last entry into the United States on February 7, 2000, even though his older sister, who was subject to similar treatment by the FARC, \"returned to Colombia in November of 2000 and then again at some point in time in 2001 according to the testimony of [Silva's] brother.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on these observations, the IJ discounted the testimony regarding the slain cows and ultimately did not find that Silva had suffered persecution in Colombia.

An Immigration Judge (IJ) found Silva's application for asylum pretermitted, and also concluded that Silva failed to carry the burden of proof with respect to his withholding of removal claim. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) adopted and affirmed the IJ's decision.

As a non-immigrant F-1 student, he was authorized to remain for the duration of his status. However, starting on or about December 23, 2000, Silva stopped attending Massachusetts Bay Community College.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 12, 2002, Silva filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal. In his application, Silva described various incidents of intimidation in his home country of Colombia. Silva recounted how, in August 1997, the guerrilla organization known as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) bombed one of his family's properties in retaliation for their political views. He also noted how his support of a \"youth group\" whose \"purpose was to orientate and guide . . . kids\" angered the FARC because it made it difficult for the guerrillas to recruit new members. According to Silva, in June 1998, a FARC commandant visited the family hacienda in Cumaral and spoke with the foreman about the family's political activities, suggesting that the family should leave the country. The family at that point moved to Bogota \"to protect [their] lives.\" Silva reported that in September of the same year, the FARC paid another visit to the hacienda, this time to express displeasure at the Silvas' failure to leave Colombia. The next day, five dead cows were found on the farm with the initials of the FARC written over the animals' carcasses. After this incident, Silva's parents asked Silva and the older of his two sisters to move to the United States, and on September 9, 1998, they did so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 1999, Silva returned to Colombia, hoping that a recent \"peace amnesty\" had changed the situation there. However, Silva noted that guerrillas \"tried to take over [his] town\" on January 10, 2000, and that this prompted his final return to the United States on February 7, 2000. In his asylum application, Silva conceded that he was filing more than one year after his last entry into the United States, but he explained that he \"didn't know about the regulation of the law about this matter.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 23, 2002, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> initiated removal proceedings against Silva for failing to maintain his non-immigrant F-1 student status. Silva admitted the factual allegations in the government's amended Notice to Appear. He also applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT), or, in the alternative, voluntary departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the removal hearing on July 9, 2004, Silva testified to many of the same incidents listed in his original application for asylum. When asked why he waited just over two years after last entering the United States to apply for asylum, Silva stated, \"I never thought that I was going to end up staying here. Things got worse and worse and that was my only choice.\" Silva further explained: \"[P]eople [are] getting killed by[] the guerrillas all over the place. They are all over the country. You do not know where they actually are. They can just come out, out of the blue, and kill you for no reason.\" Silva's brother also testified at the hearing as to the events of June 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an oral opinion, the IJ denied Silva's application for asylum on grounds that he had failed to apply for asylum within one year after the date of his arrival in the United States, and had failed to establish either changed or extraordinary circumstances.

Instead, he focused the BIA's attention on the IJ's statement that the testimony about the five slain cows could have been corroborated with photographic evidence. Silva's narrow argument in his appeal to the BIA is not sufficient to allow a broader inquiry now into the IJ's factual determination that Silva did not suffer past persecution. In any event, even if we were to reach the merits of Silva's claim, he would not prevail under the substantial evidence standard of review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Due Process</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Silva argues that his due process rights were violated because the IJ placed \"unreasonable demands\" on him to \"corroborate particular experiences.\" In essence, Silva reasserts his claim that the IJ erroneously discounted testimony about the five cows killed on his family's hacienda.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Again, we review factual findings and credibility determinations under the substantial evidence test. <i>See Elias-Zacarias,</i> 502 U.S. at 481, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112682\"><a href=\"/opinion/112682/ins-v-elias-zacarias/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

With respect to the slain cows, the IJ stated that Silva's and his brother's testimony was \"unconvincing\" because it was \"based upon the statement of a FARC guerrilla to a foreman of [Silva's] father's ranch, the statement then of the foreman of the ranch to the respondent's father and then the statement of [Silva's] father to [Silva].\" The IJ noted that, although hearsay evidence is admissible in immigration hearings, \"this sort of triple hearsay evidence is not very probative and is unreliable.\" Furthermore, the IJ observed that Silva's father, mother, and younger sister all continued to live unharmed on the family's properties in Colombia. The IJ also thought it was curious that Silva claimed to be afraid to return to Colombia ever since his last entry into the United States on February 7, 2000, even though his older sister, who was subject to similar treatment by the FARC, \"returned to Colombia in November of 2000 and then again at some point in time in 2001 according to the testimony of [Silva's] brother.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on these observations, the IJ discounted the testimony regarding the slain cows and ultimately did not find that Silva had suffered persecution in Colombia. The BIA affirmed this decision, noting that even without considering the absence of photographic evidence, Silva failed to meet his burden of proof.
