George A. O'Toole, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                   Boudin and Lipez, Circuit Judges,\n\n                      and Singal,* District Judge.\n\n\n     Robert L. Sheketoff with whom David R. Yannetti was on brief\nfor appellant.\n     Randall E. Kromm, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                             June 3, 2009\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the District of Maine, sitting by designation.\n\f            BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.           A federal jury convicted Scott\n\nBoidi on six criminal charges relating to his embezzlement of union\n\nfunds and drug conspiracy; he was sentenced to concurrent 84 month\n\nsentences on two of the counts--racketeering and conspiracy to\n\npossess with intent to distribute drugs--and lesser concurrent\n\nsentences on other counts.            He now appeals, attacking the drug\n\nconspiracy    conviction   and    (indirectly)      two    other   convictions\n\npotentially dependant on the drug conspiracy conviction.              He does\n\nnot contest his conviction on three counts that charged only\n\nembezzlement.\n\n            The facts, focusing on the drug conspiracy charge, are\n\ntaken from the trial.      During the relevant period, approximately\n\nJanuary 2000 through June 2002, Scott Boidi was the union business\n\nmanager for Tunnel Workers Local 88 in Quincy--an elected position\n\nhe had held since 1991--but some time in 2001 he developed a\n\nserious cocaine addiction.       He began to steal union funds to feed\n\nhis drug habit, taking dues money from the union and seeking\n\nunwarranted reimbursements to buy cocaine.\n\n            Boidi's wife twice expelled him from the house and, not\n\nlong after the second eviction, Boidi took up with Lynne DeMita, a\n\nchildhood    acquaintance.       In    November    2001,   Boidi   moved   into\n\nDeMita's home in Rockland, Massachusetts.             According to DeMita,\n\nthey were together as a couple living in various locations until\n\nroughly May or June 2002.    At Boidi's trial, DeMita testified that\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fduring their time together, Boidi bought cocaine daily, sometimes\n\ntwo or three times per day.\n\n          DeMita claimed to have been present \"99% of the time\"\n\nwhen Boidi bought the drugs.   The purchases took place at various\n\nlocations, including the union hall, her home in Rockland, a\n\nCopeland Street apartment in Quincy, friends' homes, and hotels.\n\nDeMita said that, while she never paid for the cocaine, Boidi gave\n\nit to her all the time and that he also shared with other friends\n\nincluding Steve Zigliano, Michael \"Mickey\" Cochran, Eddie Silva,\n\nTommy Bellotti, and his brother Alan.\n\n          There was other uneven testimony as to Boidi's sharing.\n\nCochran confirmed that he had used cocaine with Boidi, but he said\n\nthat their use had been infrequent and he was unsure whether Boidi\n\nhad ever provided the cocaine.     Thomas Brennan said that he had\n\nused cocaine with Boidi but that Boidi did not provide it.   Dominic\n\nMazzeo testified to having shared cocaine that Boidi brought to the\n\nunion hall.\n\n          Boidi and DeMita's usual suppliers were Rafael \"Ralph\"\n\nSoto and his friend Hector Vega.   Soto said that he sold to Boidi\n\nrepeatedly over the course of three or four months.   For the first\n\nmonth and a half Boidi would buy three grams three times per day\n\nbut purchases then slowed as Boidi ran short of funds; the largest\n\namount he ever purchased at one time was fifteen grams, or half an\n\nounce, which he explained by saying that he took \"care of his\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fpeople that worked for him.\"        Soto said that DeMita frequently was\n\nwith Boidi during the purchases and that he had seen DeMita, Boidi,\n\nBelotti and Zigliano use the cocaine.\n\n            Vega,    who   sometimes     worked   as    a   runner   for   Soto,\n\ntestified that he sold Boidi a minimum of three grams of cocaine\n\nper order, usually three to five days per week, one to three times\n\nper day over a period of three to four months.                 Vega said that\n\nBoidi was generally alone when he bought the cocaine, although he\n\nhad once seen Boidi give some to another person.             Vega also recalls\n\nconversations where he and Boidi discussed \"stepping on\" the\n\ncocaine (i.e., diluting it)--potentially for further distribution.\n\n            The sales eventually came to an end, and Boidi was\n\ncommitted at Bridgewater State Hospital from late March 2002 until\n\nmid-April    2002;    he   also    received   inpatient      substance     abuse\n\ntreatment at Bournewood Hospital during most of June 2002, after\n\nwhich he received outpatient treatment.           In July 2002 he took out\n\na restraining order against DeMita, apparently claiming that she\n\nwas   harassing     him.    In    due   course,   the   embezzlement       scheme\n\nunraveled and Boidi became the subject of extensive investigation.\n\n            By a nine-count superceding indictment on September 21,\n\n2005, Boidi was charged with racketeering (count 1), 18 U.S.C. §\n\n1962(c) (2006), three counts of embezzlement of union assets\n\n(counts 2-4), 29 U.S.C. § 501(c) (2006); conspiracy to possess with\n\nintent to distribute 500 or more grams of cocaine (count 5), 21\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fU.S.C.   §§   846,   841(b)(1)(B)(ii)(II)   (2006),   and   use   of   a\n\ncommunication facility to facilitate a drug crime (count 6), 21\n\nU.S.C. § 843(b).     The remaining three counts are not pertinent.1\n\n          After a lengthy jury trial, Boidi was found guilty on the\n\nsix counts just listed and given concurrent sentences of which the\n\ntwo longest were 84 months.     Boidi now appeals, challenging only\n\nthe district court's failure to give a requested lesser included\n\noffense instruction as to the drug conspiracy count; but he also\n\nargues that reversal on this conviction would bring down the RICO\n\nand communications facility convictions.\n\n          A \"defendant may be found guilty of . . . an offense\n\nnecessarily included in the offense charged,\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 31,\n\nand a defendant is entitled to such an instruction where (1) the\n\nlesser offense is \"included\" in the offense charged, United States\n\nv. Ferreira, 625 F.2d 1030, 1031 (1st Cir. 1980), (2) a contested\n\nfact separates the two offenses, id., and (3) \"the evidence would\n\npermit a jury rationally to find [the defendant] guilty of the\n\nlesser offense and acquit him of the greater.\"        Keeble v. United\n\nStates, 412 U.S. 205, 208 (1973).\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Boidi was ultimately acquitted as to using and carrying a\nfirearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime (count\n7), 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A), obstructing a proceeding of the\nNational Labor Relations Board (count 8), id. § 1505, and\npersuading a person to lie to a federal grand jury (count 9), id.\n§ 1512(b)(1).\n\n                                  -5-\n\f              Precedent says that we review de novo the decision\n\nwhether to give a lesser included offense instruction.                  United\n\nStates v. Flores, 968 F.2d 1366, 1367-68 (1st Cir. 1992).              That is\n\nclearly right as to whether a second crime is a lesser included\n\noffense; some circuits then give deference to the district court's\n\njudgment as to whether the jury could rationally find the defendant\n\nguilty of the lesser offense but acquit him of the greater.              E.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Upton, 512 F.3d 394, 402 (7th Cir.), cert. denied,\n\n129 S. Ct. 39 (2008).        The district judge did not reach the latter\n\nissue here.\n\n              The government does not dispute that possession is a\n\nlesser included offense of possession with intent to distribute,\n\ne.g., Custis v. United States, 511 U.S. 485, 488 (1994); United\n\nStates v. Ciampa, 793 F.2d 19, 27 (1st Cir. 1986), but says that\n\nconspiracy to commit each crime is distinguishable: it argues that\n\nan agreement to possess is a different agreement and not a lesser\n\nincluded      version   of   an   agreement   to   possess   with   intent    to\n\ndistribute.      The two different agreements, it says, could easily\n\nturn on different evidence and involve different people.\n\n              The district court agreed that conspiracy to possess is\n\nnot a lesser included offense of conspiracy to possess with intent\n\nto distribute, explaining that \"it would be if we were talking\n\nabout   the    substantive    offenses\"     but    that   \"the   government   is\n\nentitled to charge[,] at the risk of not being able to prove it, a\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fparticular agreement as a conspiracy charge.\"     With more time to\n\nponder the government's position than a trial judge fashioning an\n\ninstruction in mid-trial, we take a different view.\n\n          The government's own position on the issue, although well\n\nargued here, has not been consistent.   In at least one case, United\n\nStates v. Moran, Nos. 90-5024, 90-5025, 1991 WL 125461, at *4 (4th\n\nCir. Oct. 24, 1991) (unpublished), the government took the position\n\nit urges here (and lost); in several others, it was content to\n\nconcede the lesser conspiracy was included in the greater.    E.g.,\n\nUnited States v. White, 972 F.2d 590, 596 (5th Cir. 1992), cert.\n\ndenied, 507 U.S. 1007 (1993).\n\n          In all events, courts that have confronted this or\n\ncomparable issues have regularly concluded or assumed that a less\n\nserious conspiracy can be a lesser included offense of a similar\n\nbut greater one.   This is so both as to drug cases involving the\n\nsame issue as our case2 and as to cases (we list many in an\n\n\n     2\n      United States v. Carroll, 140 F. App'x 168, 169 (11th Cir.\n2005) (per curiam) (unpublished); United States v. Ruhbayan, 406\nF.3d 292, 295-96 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 917 (2005);\nUnited States v. Araujo, No. 98-21008, 2000 WL 309408, at *1 (5th\nCir. Feb. 28, 2000) (per curiam) (unpublished); United States v.\nNeely, No. 94-5107, 1996 WL 60329, at *2 (4th Cir.) (unpublished),\ncert. denied, 519 U.S. 861 (1996); United States v. Valencia, No.\n94-10348, 1995 WL 444658, at *4 (9th Cir.) (unpublished), cert.\ndenied, 516 U.S. 1001 (1995); United States v. Vaandering, 50 F.3d\n696, 703 (9th Cir. 1995); United States v. Underwood, No. 94-5897,\n1995 WL 241992, at *1 (6th Cir. Apr. 25, 1995) (unpublished);\nUnited States v. Garcia, 27 F.3d 1009, 1014-15 (5th Cir.), cert.\ndenied sub nom Chavez v. United States, 513 U.S. 1009 (1994);\nUnited States v. Baker, 985 F.2d 1248, 1259 (4th Cir. 1993), cert.\ndenied, 510 U.S. 1040 (1994); Moran, 1991 WL 125461, at *4; United\n\n                                -7-\n\faddendum) involving other kinds of drug or non-drug conspiracies\n\nhaving an additional element separating a more serious one from a\n\nless serious one.      This court has assumed the same in passing,\n\nUnited States v. Arroyo, 546 F.3d 54, 56 (1st Cir. 2008), but has\n\nnot formally decided the issue.\n\n          The initial question is an abstract and strictly legal\n\none: whether, looking to the required elements of a pair of crimes,\n\nthe two crimes coincide except that to commit the greater crime, an\n\nadditional     ingredient   (or   ingredients)   is   necessary.   That\n\nrequirement is satisfied here: a vertical \"conspiracy to possess\n\ndrugs with intent to distribute\" can easily be said to be a\n\n\"conspiracy to possess drugs\" with one added element, namely, that\n\nthe parties also had a shared aim that the possessed drugs then be\n\ndistributed.\n\n          Of course, to justify the instruction in a particular\n\ncase, there must--at a factual level--be some core of facts that is\n\ncommon to the scenario that the government sought to prove and the\n\none that the defendant claims to show only a lesser included\n\noffense. If the government charges and seeks to prove a conspiracy\n\nto possess with intent to distribute heroin in New York in 2005 but\n\nthe evidence arguably showed only a conspiracy to possess in San\n\nFrancisco in 2007, this would call only for an instruction that the\n\n\nStates v. Miller, 939 F.2d 605, 609 (8th Cir. 1991); United States\nv. O'Meara, 895 F.2d 1216, 1219-20 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 498\nU.S. 943 (1990).\n\n                                    -8-\n\fjury not convict if the government proves a conspiracy different\n\nthan that charged.     E.g., United States v. Candelaria-Silva, 166\n\nF.3d 19, 39 (1st Cir. 1999), cert. denied sub nom Ortiz-Miranda v.\n\nUnited States, 529 U.S. 1055 (2000).\n\n          This is a problem that a trial judge might have to sort\n\nout in deciding whether to give a multiple conspiracy instruction,\n\nbut it is not remotely present here.      Whether one looks at the\n\ngreater or lesser crime in this case, the conspirators and drugs\n\nsold to Boidi are identical; the only further question is whether\n\nBoidi intended to distribute the drugs and whether the distributors\n\nshared in that aim as part of the agreement.   However this question\n\nis answered, the two offenses relate to the same underlying events.\n\n          In arguing here against the requested instruction, the\n\ngovernment says that different witnesses could be needed to prove\n\nthe lesser crime; but, in reality, to justify the instruction, the\n\nlesser \"included\" offense has to be a version of much the same\n\nfactual scenario as the greater offense charged in the indictment\n\nwith a single difference: that the added element needed for the\n\ngreater offense need not be proved.        The witnesses that the\n\ngovernment chose to prove the greater offense are the proof of the\n\nlesser included one.\n\n          Of course, the government might have different witnesses\n\nwho could prove a possession conspiracy involving Boidi that was\n\nsubstantially different from and not included within the greater\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fconspiracy sought to be proved at trial; it could choose to\n\nprosecute for this crime or not, but it would not be a lesser\n\nincluded offense in this case.      The instruction is required only\n\nwhere the evidence actually presented at trial would itself allow\n\na rational jury to convict of the lesser offense rather than the\n\ngreater one urged by the government.      Ferreira, 625 F.2d at 1031.\n\n           We therefore hold that a possession conspiracy is a\n\nlesser included offense of a conspiracy to possess with intent to\n\ndistribute and that the scenarios here overlap, but the instruction\n\nrequires that a further condition be met (it can, as above, be\n\nphrased   as   two   further   conditions):   that,   on   the   evidence\n\npresented, it would be rational for the jury to convict only on the\n\nlesser included offense and not the greater one.           Otherwise the\n\ninstruction need not be given.      Flores, 968 F.2d at 1371.\n\n           The government is right in saying that a jury on this\n\nrecord could not rationally have doubted that Boidi distributed\n\ndrugs to DeMita.     Whether or not sharing with a girlfriend is often\n\nso prosecuted, it is as much \"distribution\" as selling on a street\n\ncorner.   United States v. Cormier, 468 F.3d 63, 70 n.3 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).    Evidence as to Boidi's sharing with or selling to other\n\npersons appears in the record but is not as strong or consistent.\n\n           The evidence as to sharing with DeMita came not only from\n\nDeMita's extensive (and possibly unfriendly) testimony but also\n\nfrom both Soto and Vega and from defense counsel's own cross\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fexamination of DeMita, which included questions that assumed joint\n\ncocaine use, such as \"you liked to smoke it . . . so he needed\n\nmore, right?\"          So Boidi clearly possessed the cocaine with intent\n\nto distribute.           If he had been charged and convicted of that\n\nsubstantive crime, the case would be all over.\n\n                 Instead Boidi was charged only with conspiracy to commit\n\nthe substantive crime.          The penalties are the same, 21 U.S.C. §\n\n846,       but   the   government   may    get   evidentiary   and   atmospheric\n\nadvantages by charging conspiracy.               Here, it is true that it was\n\n\"distribution\" to give the drug to a girlfriend; Boidi had a\n\ncontinuing relationship with the dealers; and they knew that Boidi\n\nwas re-distributing the drugs at least to DeMita.               Yet, on a close\n\nlook, these facts do not necessarily compel a finding that the\n\ncharged conspiracy occurred.\n\n                 The use of conspiracy doctrine in a vertical context has\n\ncaused courts unease.         In this circuit the continuing purchase and\n\nsale relationship between Soto, Vega and Boidi, and the dealers'\n\nknowledge of Boidi's re-distribution, would permit a jury to infer\n\nboth an agreement between them that Boidi possess the drugs and the\n\nrequisite intent as to distribution.3              But it would not compel a\n\njury to find the latter element, because the \"intent to distribute\"\n\n\n\n       3\n      United States v. Moran, 984 F.2d 1299, 1303-04 (1st Cir.\n1993). Compare United States v. Hawkins, 547 F.3d 66, 74-75 (2d\nCir. 2008), and United States v. Lechuga, 994 F.2d 346, 350-51 (7th\nCir.)

See United States v.\n\nTobin, 552 F.3d 29, 32-33 (1st Cir. 2009).        But a conspiracy is an\n\nagreement between two (or more) parties having a shared \"objective\"\n\nor \"design\" to commit the crime, so mere knowledge by Soto or Vega\n\nas to what Boidi would do with the drugs is not enough unless they\n\nshared Boidi's purpose to re-distribute.4         A main rationale for\n\nmaking conspiracy a crime is that the shared purpose increases the\n\nlikelihood   of   accomplishment    and   makes   the   enterprise   more\n\ndangerous. Moran, 984 F.2d at 1302-03; Developments, supra note 7,\n\nat 924-25.\n\n          The intent \"to further, promote, or cooperate in\" the\n\nbuyer's illegal activity \"is the gist of conspiracy\" and \"knowledge\n\nis the foundation of intent,\" but \"not every instance of sale of\n\nrestricted goods . . . in which the seller knows the buyer intends\n\nto use them unlawfully, will support a charge of conspiracy.\"\n\nDirect Sales Co. v.

Glenn, 828 F.2d 855, 857-58 (1st Cir. 1987) (Breyer, J.).\n\n           Stake and purpose are closely related, and DeMita's share\n\nincreased the frequency and quantity of Boidi's purchases.    So the\n\njury here could have found that Soto or Vega had a stake in the\n\nredistribution beyond mere knowledge of it or, put differently,\n\nthat re-distribution as well as possession was a joint aim.    But,\n\nby contrast to what Soto or Vega's stake would have been if Boidi\n\nwere engaged in commercial re-distribution on a large scale, the\n\ninference of joint purpose to re-distribute here is far from\n\ninevitable or compelling.\n\n           The required instruction is prompted by a concern that,\n\ndeprived of a lesser included option, the jury may stretch to\n\nconvict the defendant of the greater crime.     Flores, 968 F.2d at\n\n1369; United States v. Balthazard, 360 F.3d 309, 320 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).   Here nothing compelled the jury to find that the suppliers\n\nand Boidi were conspiring that Boidi should possess the drugs with\n\n\n\n                                -13-\n\fintent to distribute.      The jury could rationally have convicted of\n\nthe lesser conspiracy, and the instruction should have been given.\n\n           So, the conspiracy conviction cannot stand (although the\n\ngovernment could retry the charge with the required instruction),\n\nso we turn to the consequences.         It is clear that the conspiracy\n\nconviction must be vacated, but two separate issues remain: whether\n\na conviction on the lesser included offense may be substituted\n\nwithout a new trial or Boidi's consent, and what effects either\n\nvacation or substitution have on two of Boidi's other convictions.\n\n           Where a lesser included offense charge should have been\n\ngiven, several circuits have allowed the district court on remand,\n\nin its discretion and with the government's consent, to enter\n\njudgment of conviction on the lesser included offense where the\n\njury necessarily found every fact required for conviction of the\n\nlesser offense.5      The premise is that, given the actual conviction\n\nsupported by adequate evidence, the best the defendant could have\n\nobtained   by   the   charge   is   conviction   on   the   lesser   included\n\noffense.\n\n           The government's answering brief urged that the district\n\ncourt be given this option; Boidi filed no reply brief and so is\n\nnot on record as arguing that the other circuits' approach is wrong\n\n\n     5\n      United States v. Burns, 624 F.2d 95, 105 (10th Cir.), cert.\ndenied, 449 U.S. 954 (1980); United States v. Crutchfield, 547 F.2d\n496, 502 (9th Cir. 1977); United States v. Whitaker, 447 F.2d 314,\n322 (D.C. Cir. 1971); see also United States v. Levy, 703 F.2d 791,\n794 n.9 (4th Cir. 1983).\n\n                                     -14-\n\for contesting this solution here.       We think that the approach is at\n\nleast colorable but leave Boidi free on remand (if the government\n\npresses the request) to argue that it is mistaken, that the\n\nnecessary conditions have not been met or that the district court\n\nought not allow it for other reasons.\n\n           As to the impact of our vacating of the drug conviction\n\non Boidi's other convictions, Boidi's brief asserts summarily that\n\nthe RICO conviction must fall because the drug conspiracy was one\n\nof the predicate acts; but the RICO conviction was supported by the\n\njury's   specific   finding   that    the    government    had     proven   five\n\npredicate acts--three acts of embezzlement of union assets plus the\n\nconspiracy and the use of a communications facility to facilitate\n\na drug crime.\n\n           The   three   embezzlement       acts   are   legally    sufficient\n\npredicates and only two are needed to support the RICO conviction.\n\nUnited States v. Cianci, 378 F.3d 71, 91 (1st Cir. 2004); United\n\nStates v. Edwards, 303 F.3d 606, 642 (5th Cir. 2002), cert. denied,\n\n537 U.S. 1192 (2003).    Boidi has not countered this argument and no\n\ncounter is obvious.      Thus, the RICO conviction stands whether or\n\nnot a possession conspiracy conviction is substituted on remand;\n\nbut the RICO sentence--indeed, all of the sentences imposed on\n\nBoidi--will likely have to be recomputed.\n\n           The effect of vacating the drug conspiracy conviction on\n\nthe communications facility conviction is more complicated. In the\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\findictment, the communications facility charge was tied to the\n\nconspiracy count, and the district court instructed the jury that\n\nit had to find that Boidi knowingly and intentionally used a\n\ncommunications facility to cause or facilitate the drug traffic\n\noffense charged in count 5 (the conspiracy).   Thus, presumptively\n\nour vacation of the latter conviction undoes the former as well.\n\n          The government says that the communications conviction\n\ncan be supported by a conviction for conspiracy to possess and so\n\nshould be reinstated on remand if that conviction is substituted.\n\nBut conspiracy to possess is a misdemeanor under federal law,6 and\n\nso cannot supply the requisite felony to support the conviction, 21\n\nU.S.C. §§ 843(b), 802(13); United States v. Baggett, 890 F.2d 1095,\n\n1098 (10th Cir. 1989), although it could be re-tried if the\n\ngovernment retries the original conspiracy charge or otherwise\n\npermissibly satisfies the felony predicate requirement.\n\n          Where multiple convictions are entered, the sentences are\n\noften driven by the most serious of the crimes; RICO, of course, is\n\na serious crime but its sentence often reflects the underlying\n\n\n     6\n      21 U.S.C. §§ 844, 846; see Lopez v. Gonzales, 549 U.S. 47,\n52-54 & n.4, 59-60 (2006); Ruhbayan, 406 F.3d at 295-96; United\nStates v. Stone, 139 F.3d 822, 830 (11th Cir. 1998); United States\nv.

A preliminary look suggests\n\nthat without the present drug conviction, Boidi might enjoy a lower\n\nultimate sentence and that the sentences on all of the counts could\n\nbe affected; what the outcome would be if the possession conspiracy\n\nconviction is substituted can be addressed by the district court\n\nand parties on remand if and when necessary.\n\n          The convictions on counts 5 and 6 are vacated; the\n\nconvictions on the remaining counts are affirmed.

A federal jury convicted Scott\n\nBoidi on six criminal charges relating to his embezzlement of union\n\nfunds and drug conspiracy; he was sentenced to concurrent 84 month\n\nsentences on two of the counts--racketeering and conspiracy to\n\npossess with intent to distribute drugs--and lesser concurrent\n\nsentences on other counts.            He now appeals, attacking the drug\n\nconspiracy    conviction   and    (indirectly)      two    other   convictions\n\npotentially dependant on the drug conspiracy conviction.              He does\n\nnot contest his conviction on three counts that charged only\n\nembezzlement.\n\n            The facts, focusing on the drug conspiracy charge, are\n\ntaken from the trial.      During the relevant period, approximately\n\nJanuary 2000 through June 2002, Scott Boidi was the union business\n\nmanager for Tunnel Workers Local 88 in Quincy--an elected position\n\nhe had held since 1991--but some time in 2001 he developed a\n\nserious cocaine addiction.       He began to steal union funds to feed\n\nhis drug habit, taking dues money from the union and seeking\n\nunwarranted reimbursements to buy cocaine.\n\n            Boidi's wife twice expelled him from the house and, not\n\nlong after the second eviction, Boidi took up with Lynne DeMita, a\n\nchildhood    acquaintance.       In    November    2001,   Boidi   moved   into\n\nDeMita's home in Rockland, Massachusetts.             According to DeMita,\n\nthey were together as a couple living in various locations until\n\nroughly May or June 2002.    At Boidi's trial, DeMita testified that\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fduring their time together, Boidi bought cocaine daily, sometimes\n\ntwo or three times per day.\n\n          DeMita claimed to have been present \"99% of the time\"\n\nwhen Boidi bought the drugs.   The purchases took place at various\n\nlocations, including the union hall, her home in Rockland, a\n\nCopeland Street apartment in Quincy, friends' homes, and hotels.\n\nDeMita said that, while she never paid for the cocaine, Boidi gave\n\nit to her all the time and that he also shared with other friends\n\nincluding Steve Zigliano, Michael \"Mickey\" Cochran, Eddie Silva,\n\nTommy Bellotti, and his brother Alan.\n\n          There was other uneven testimony as to Boidi's sharing.\n\nCochran confirmed that he had used cocaine with Boidi, but he said\n\nthat their use had been infrequent and he was unsure whether Boidi\n\nhad ever provided the cocaine.     Thomas Brennan said that he had\n\nused cocaine with Boidi but that Boidi did not provide it.   Dominic\n\nMazzeo testified to having shared cocaine that Boidi brought to the\n\nunion hall.\n\n          Boidi and DeMita's usual suppliers were Rafael \"Ralph\"\n\nSoto and his friend Hector Vega.   Soto said that he sold to Boidi\n\nrepeatedly over the course of three or four months.   For the first\n\nmonth and a half Boidi would buy three grams three times per day\n\nbut purchases then slowed as Boidi ran short of funds; the largest\n\namount he ever purchased at one time was fifteen grams, or half an\n\nounce, which he explained by saying that he took \"care of his\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fpeople that worked for him.\"        Soto said that DeMita frequently was\n\nwith Boidi during the purchases and that he had seen DeMita, Boidi,\n\nBelotti and Zigliano use the cocaine.\n\n            Vega,    who   sometimes     worked   as    a   runner   for   Soto,\n\ntestified that he sold Boidi a minimum of three grams of cocaine\n\nper order, usually three to five days per week, one to three times\n\nper day over a period of three to four months.                 Vega said that\n\nBoidi was generally alone when he bought the cocaine, although he\n\nhad once seen Boidi give some to another person.             Vega also recalls\n\nconversations where he and Boidi discussed \"stepping on\" the\n\ncocaine (i.e., diluting it)--potentially for further distribution.\n\n            The sales eventually came to an end, and Boidi was\n\ncommitted at Bridgewater State Hospital from late March 2002 until\n\nmid-April    2002;    he   also    received   inpatient      substance     abuse\n\ntreatment at Bournewood Hospital during most of June 2002, after\n\nwhich he received outpatient treatment.           In July 2002 he took out\n\na restraining order against DeMita, apparently claiming that she\n\nwas   harassing     him.    In    due   course,   the   embezzlement       scheme\n\nunraveled and Boidi became the subject of extensive investigation.\n\n            By a nine-count superceding indictment on September 21,\n\n2005, Boidi was charged with racketeering (count 1), 18 U.S.C. §\n\n1962(c) (2006), three counts of embezzlement of union assets\n\n(counts 2-4), 29 U.S.C. § 501(c) (2006); conspiracy to possess with\n\nintent to distribute 500 or more grams of cocaine (count 5), 21\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fU.S.C.   §§   846,   841(b)(1)(B)(ii)(II)   (2006),   and   use   of   a\n\ncommunication facility to facilitate a drug crime (count 6), 21\n\nU.S.C. § 843(b).     The remaining three counts are not pertinent.1\n\n          After a lengthy jury trial, Boidi was found guilty on the\n\nsix counts just listed and given concurrent sentences of which the\n\ntwo longest were 84 months.     Boidi now appeals, challenging only\n\nthe district court's failure to give a requested lesser included\n\noffense instruction as to the drug conspiracy count; but he also\n\nargues that reversal on this conviction would bring down the RICO\n\nand communications facility convictions.\n\n          A \"defendant may be found guilty of . . . an offense\n\nnecessarily included in the offense charged,\" Fed.

That\n\nrequirement is satisfied here: a vertical \"conspiracy to possess\n\ndrugs with intent to distribute\" can easily be said to be a\n\n\"conspiracy to possess drugs\" with one added element, namely, that\n\nthe parties also had a shared aim that the possessed drugs then be\n\ndistributed.\n\n          Of course, to justify the instruction in a particular\n\ncase, there must--at a factual level--be some core of facts that is\n\ncommon to the scenario that the government sought to prove and the\n\none that the defendant claims to show only a lesser included\n\noffense. If the government charges and seeks to prove a conspiracy\n\nto possess with intent to distribute heroin in New York in 2005 but\n\nthe evidence arguably showed only a conspiracy to possess in San\n\nFrancisco in 2007, this would call only for an instruction that the\n\n\nStates v.

Whether one looks at the\n\ngreater or lesser crime in this case, the conspirators and drugs\n\nsold to Boidi are identical; the only further question is whether\n\nBoidi intended to distribute the drugs and whether the distributors\n\nshared in that aim as part of the agreement.   However this question\n\nis answered, the two offenses relate to the same underlying events.\n\n          In arguing here against the requested instruction, the\n\ngovernment says that different witnesses could be needed to prove\n\nthe lesser crime; but, in reality, to justify the instruction, the\n\nlesser \"included\" offense has to be a version of much the same\n\nfactual scenario as the greater offense charged in the indictment\n\nwith a single difference: that the added element needed for the\n\ngreater offense need not be proved.        The witnesses that the\n\ngovernment chose to prove the greater offense are the proof of the\n\nlesser included one.\n\n          Of course, the government might have different witnesses\n\nwho could prove a possession conspiracy involving Boidi that was\n\nsubstantially different from and not included within the greater\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fconspiracy sought to be proved at trial; it could choose to\n\nprosecute for this crime or not, but it would not be a lesser\n\nincluded offense in this case.      The instruction is required only\n\nwhere the evidence actually presented at trial would itself allow\n\na rational jury to convict of the lesser offense rather than the\n\ngreater one urged by the government.      Ferreira, 625 F.2d at 1031.\n\n           We therefore hold that a possession conspiracy is a\n\nlesser included offense of a conspiracy to possess with intent to\n\ndistribute and that the scenarios here overlap, but the instruction\n\nrequires that a further condition be met (it can, as above, be\n\nphrased   as   two   further   conditions):   that,   on   the   evidence\n\npresented, it would be rational for the jury to convict only on the\n\nlesser included offense and not the greater one.           Otherwise the\n\ninstruction need not be given.      Flores, 968 F.2d at 1371.\n\n           The government is right in saying that a jury on this\n\nrecord could not rationally have doubted that Boidi distributed\n\ndrugs to DeMita.     Whether or not sharing with a girlfriend is often\n\nso prosecuted, it is as much \"distribution\" as selling on a street\n\ncorner.   United States v. Cormier, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202508\"><a href=\"/opinion/202508/united-states-v-cormier/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 70 n.3 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).    Evidence as to Boidi's sharing with or selling to other\n\npersons appears in the record but is not as strong or consistent.\n\n           The evidence as to sharing with DeMita came not only from\n\nDeMita's extensive (and possibly unfriendly) testimony but also\n\nfrom both Soto and Vega and from defense counsel's own cross\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fexamination of DeMita, which included questions that assumed joint\n\ncocaine use, such as \"you liked to smoke it . . . so he needed\n\nmore, right?\"          So Boidi clearly possessed the cocaine with intent\n\nto distribute.           If he had been charged and convicted of that\n\nsubstantive crime, the case would be all over.\n\n                 Instead Boidi was charged only with conspiracy to commit\n\nthe substantive crime.          The penalties are the same, 21 U.S.C. §\n\n846,       but   the   government   may    get   evidentiary   and   atmospheric\n\nadvantages by charging conspiracy.               Here, it is true that it was\n\n\"distribution\" to give the drug to a girlfriend; Boidi had a\n\ncontinuing relationship with the dealers; and they knew that Boidi\n\nwas re-distributing the drugs at least to DeMita.               Yet, on a close\n\nlook, these facts do not necessarily compel a finding that the\n\ncharged conspiracy occurred.\n\n                 The use of conspiracy doctrine in a vertical context has\n\ncaused courts unease.         In this circuit the continuing purchase and\n\nsale relationship between Soto, Vega and Boidi, and the dealers'\n\nknowledge of Boidi's re-distribution, would permit a jury to infer\n\nboth an agreement between them that Boidi possess the drugs and the\n\nrequisite intent as to distribution.3              But it would not compel a\n\njury to find the latter element, because the \"intent to distribute\"\n\n\n\n       3\n      United States v.

So the\n\njury here could have found that Soto or Vega had a stake in the\n\nredistribution beyond mere knowledge of it or, put differently,\n\nthat re-distribution as well as possession was a joint aim.    But,\n\nby contrast to what Soto or Vega's stake would have been if Boidi\n\nwere engaged in commercial re-distribution on a large scale, the\n\ninference of joint purpose to re-distribute here is far from\n\ninevitable or compelling.\n\n           The required instruction is prompted by a concern that,\n\ndeprived of a lesser included option, the jury may stretch to\n\nconvict the defendant of the greater crime.

The jury could rationally have convicted of\n\nthe lesser conspiracy, and the instruction should have been given.\n\n           So, the conspiracy conviction cannot stand (although the\n\ngovernment could retry the charge with the required instruction),\n\nso we turn to the consequences.         It is clear that the conspiracy\n\nconviction must be vacated, but two separate issues remain: whether\n\na conviction on the lesser included offense may be substituted\n\nwithout a new trial or Boidi's consent, and what effects either\n\nvacation or substitution have on two of Boidi's other convictions.\n\n           Where a lesser included offense charge should have been\n\ngiven, several circuits have allowed the district court on remand,\n\nin its discretion and with the government's consent, to enter\n\njudgment of conviction on the lesser included offense where the\n\njury necessarily found every fact required for conviction of the\n\nlesser offense.5      The premise is that, given the actual conviction\n\nsupported by adequate evidence, the best the defendant could have\n\nobtained   by   the   charge   is   conviction   on   the   lesser   included\n\noffense.\n\n           The government's answering brief urged that the district\n\ncourt be given this option; Boidi filed no reply brief and so is\n\nnot on record as arguing that the other circuits' approach is wrong\n\n\n     5\n      United States v.

Thus, the RICO conviction stands whether or\n\nnot a possession conspiracy conviction is substituted on remand;\n\nbut the RICO sentence--indeed, all of the sentences imposed on\n\nBoidi--will likely have to be recomputed.\n\n           The effect of vacating the drug conspiracy conviction on\n\nthe communications facility conviction is more complicated. In the\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\findictment, the communications facility charge was tied to the\n\nconspiracy count, and the district court instructed the jury that\n\nit had to find that Boidi knowingly and intentionally used a\n\ncommunications facility to cause or facilitate the drug traffic\n\noffense charged in count 5 (the conspiracy).   Thus, presumptively\n\nour vacation of the latter conviction undoes the former as well.\n\n          The government says that the communications conviction\n\ncan be supported by a conviction for conspiracy to possess and so\n\nshould be reinstated on remand if that conviction is substituted.\n\nBut conspiracy to possess is a misdemeanor under federal law,6 and\n\nso cannot supply the requisite felony to support the conviction, 21\n\nU.S.C. §§ 843(b), 802(13); United States v.
