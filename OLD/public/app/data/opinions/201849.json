We have therefore substituted\nAttorney General Gonzales for John Ashcroft as the respondent.\nSee Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(d)(1); Fed. R. App. P. 43(c)(2).\n\n     **Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f           Per Curiam.   Dorothea Langitan petitions for review of\n\nthe decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") to deny\n\nher applications for asylum and withholding of removal. We dismiss\n\nthe asylum claim for a lack of jurisdiction and deny the remainder\n\nof the petition.\n\n           Langitan is a native and citizen of Indonesia.               She\n\nentered the United States on March 7, 2001 under a non-immigrant\n\nvisitor's visa.    On March 11, 2002, she filed applications for\n\nasylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the United Nations\n\nConvention Against Torture (\"CAT\"). In April 2002, the Immigration\n\nand Naturalization Service (\"INS\") issued a notice of removal\n\ncharging Langitan with unlawfully remaining in the United States\n\nbeyond the terms of her visa and being subject to removal under 8\n\nU.S.C. ยง 1227(a)(1)(B).1      A removal hearing before an immigration\n\njudge (\"IJ\") was subsequently convened to consider Langitan's\n\napplications for relief.\n\n           Langitan was the only witness at the removal proceeding.\n\nShe testified that she was subject to persecution by members of the\n\nMuslim majority in Indonesia because of her Roman Catholic faith.\n\nLangitan   described   four    incidents   to   support   her   claim    of\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      In March 2003, the relevant functions of the INS were\nreorganized and transferred into the new Department of Homeland\nSecurity.\n\n                                   -2-\n\fpersecution.2    In November 2000, people who Langitan thought were\n\nMuslim threw rocks at the church in which she was worshiping.\n\nNobody was hurt, the building was not damaged, and the authorities\n\nwere not notified.   Around the same time, Langitan saw a flyer that\n\nstated that it would be a \"bloody Christmas,\" but she conceded that\n\nshe did not know the origin of the flyer.\n\n           The other two incidents occurred at the local Catholic\n\nhospital where Langitan worked as a nurse.        Langitan detailed two\n\nincidents in which Muslims with critically ill relatives threatened\n\nher with violence if the relatives died.         Langitan admitted that\n\nthose making the threats did not mention her religion and that the\n\nremarks could have been motivated by anxiety about the relative's\n\ncondition.    Langitan further conceded that she has never suffered\n\nanti-Catholic intimidation from any government official; that she\n\nfreely participated in the Indonesian political process; that her\n\nCatholic   church   and   hospital   are   currently   operating   without\n\nsubstantial interference from government authorities; and that her\n\nson still resides in Indonesia, attends Catholic school, and openly\n\npractices Catholicism.\n\n           The IJ rejected Langitan's applications for relief on two\n\ngrounds:     (1) Langitan's asylum application was time-barred; and\n\n(2) Langitan had failed to demonstrate that she was likely to\n\n\n     2\n      In addition to these specific incidents, Langitan stated that\nshe had heard rumors about incidents of anti-Catholic violence in\nother parts of Indonesia.\n\n                                     -3-\n\fsuffer persecution on account of her religion if she returned to\n\nIndonesia.   Langitan appealed to the BIA which generally affirmed\n\nand specifically endorsed the IJ's conclusion \"that [Langitan] was\n\nineligible for asylum because of a failure to file for such relief\n\nwithin the required time period.\" Langitan sought reconsideration,\n\nwhich the BIA denied, and then petitioned this court for review.\n\n          Langitan raises three issues.     First, she contends that\n\nthe BIA erred in determining that her asylum application was\n\nuntimely. Second, she claims that there was inadequate evidence to\n\nsupport the IJ's ruling that she had not demonstrated a likelihood\n\nof persecution on her return to Indonesia.       Finally, she argues\n\nthat her removal proceeding was conducted in an unfair manner.\n\n          We   lack   jurisdiction   to   consider   Langitan's   claim\n\nconcerning the timeliness of her asylum application. An individual\n\napplying for asylum must \"demonstrate[] by clear and convincing\n\nevidence that the application has been filed within 1 year after\n\nthe date of the [individual's] arrival in the United States.\"         8\n\nU.S.C. ยง 1158(a)(2)(B).    We may not review the BIA's conclusion\n\nthat an asylum application was filed outside the time period\n\nspecified in 8 U.S.C. ยง 1158(a)(2)(B).     See 8 U.S.C. ยง 1158(a)(3);\n\nsee also Njenga v. Ashcroft, 386 F.3d 335, 339 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n          While an asylum application is subject to a one-year\n\nfiling deadline, no such deadline applies to an application for the\n\nwithholding of removal.   See Zheng v. Gonzales, 409 F.3d 804, 808\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f(7th Cir. 2005).         We therefore may consider the merits of this\n\nclaim.3       To establish eligibility for withholding of removal,\n\nLangitan had to prove that \"upon deportation she was more likely\n\nthan not to face persecution on account of . . . [her] religion .\n\n. . .\"      Njenga, 386 F.3d at 339 (emphasis in original).         We review\n\nthe determination that Langitan did not meet this standard for\n\nsubstantial evidence.        See id. at 339-40.     Under the substantial\n\nevidence test, we will reverse \"only when the record evidence would\n\ncompel a reasonable factfinder to make a contrary determination.\"\n\nAguilar-Solis v. INS, 168 F.3d 565, 569 (1st Cir. 1999).             Because\n\nthe BIA adopted the reasoning of the IJ in its entirety, we review\n\nthe decision of the IJ directly. See Njenga, 386 F.3d at 338.\n\n              Langitan   contends   that   the   IJ's   rejection    of   her\n\nwithholding of removal claim was based on a selective reading of a\n\nState       Department   Report   concerning     religious   tolerance     in\n\nIndonesia.       We disagree.     The State Department Report contained\n\nmixed conclusions about the situation in Indonesia.             The Report\n\nrecognized that there had been reports of civil strife between\n\nMuslims and Christians in certain parts of the country.               But it\n\nalso noted that, during 2001, the Indonesian Government had worked\n\nto end much of the Muslim-Christian violence.             The IJ read the\n\n\n\n        3\n      Langitan also sought relief under the CAT but does not here\npress any arguments relative to this claim. We therefore consider\nthe CAT claim waived. See Mediouni v. INS, 314 F.3d 24, 28 n.5\n(1st Cir. 2002).\n\n                                     -5-\n\fReport as recognizing that religious violence was on the wane in\n\nIndonesia, and his reading was not unreasonable.\n\n              In any event, Langitan's testimony amply supports the\n\nIJ's conclusion that she was unlikely to face religious persecution\n\nif she returned to Indonesia.            Langitan testified to only a single\n\nact    of    religiously    motivated      violence      --   the    rock    throwing\n\nincident.      Cf. Bocova v. Gonzales, 412 F.3d 257, 263 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (stating that generally the violence required to demonstrate\n\nan entitlement to asylum must be \"systematic rather than reflective\n\nof a series of isolated incidents\").                 Moreover, she acknowledged\n\nthat   her    son,   a   practicing      Catholic,     continues     to     reside   in\n\nIndonesia, and she did not indicate that he is in any danger.\n\nSee    Aguilar-Solis,      168    F.3d   at    573    (\"[T]he   fact      that   close\n\nrelatives continue to live peacefully in the alien's homeland\n\nundercuts the alien's claim that persecution awaits his return.\");\n\nsee also Khalil v. Ashcroft, 337 F.3d 50, 56 (1st Cir. 2003)\n\n(finding no well-founded fear of persecution where petitioner's\n\nsibling      remained      in    country      of     origin   without       suffering\n\npersecution).        Finally,      Langitan        admitted   that   the     Catholic\n\ninstitutions with which she associated are currently operational.\n\nThese facts provide substantial evidence to support the conclusion\n\nthat Langitan is unlikely to face religious persecution upon her\n\nreturn to Indonesia.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\f           Finally, Langitan contends that her removal proceeding\n\nwas unfair.    She bases this claim on the questioning by the IJ\n\nconcerning    her   testimony   about   the   hospital   incidents   --\n\nquestioning she describes as \"aggressive.\"      This argument was not\n\nraised either before the IJ or the BIA so we will not consider it.\n\nSee Njenga, 386 F.3d at 338; Opere v. INS, 267 F.3d 10, 14 (1st\n\nCir. 2001).\n\n           The petition for review is dismissed in part and denied\n\nin part.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f",

She bases this claim on the questioning by the IJ\n\nconcerning    her   testimony   about   the   hospital   incidents   --\n\nquestioning she describes as \"aggressive.\"      This argument was not\n\nraised either before the IJ or the BIA so we will not consider it.\n\nSee Njenga, 386 F.3d at 338; Opere v.
