Plaintiffs-appellants Michael, Jocelyn and\n\nSuzanne Sadlowski appeal from the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment dismissing their federal claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1983, against defendant Louis Benoit and remanding their state law\n\nclaims to state court.         \"We review a summary judgment de novo,\n\nviewing the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving\n\nparty to determine whether there exists a genuine issue of material\n\nfact.\" Muniz Cortes v. Intermedics, Inc., 229 F.3d 12 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).\n\n             In their brief, appellants base their challenge to the\n\ngrant of summary judgment on two alleged errors by the district\n\ncourt: 1) in ruling that plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment claim based\n\non a search pursuant to an invalid warrant was precluded under the\n\ndoctrine     of   collateral   estoppel,    and   2)   in   granting    summary\n\njudgment sua sponte on the claim contained in ¶ 6 of the amended\n\ncomplaint (threatening manner of the search).\n\nI.   Claim    That   Search    Pursuant    to   Invalid     Warrant    Violated\n\nPlaintiffs' Fourth Amendment Rights\n\n\n             The district court held that the claim that plaintiffs'\n\nFourth Amendment rights were violated by defendant's search of\n\ntheir residence pursuant to an invalid warrant was precluded by a\n\ndetermination by the           Leominster District Court, denying for\n\n\"insufficient evidence\" plaintiffs' application for issuance of a\n\ncriminal complaint against defendant Louis Benoit, pursuant to\n\n                                     -2-\n\fMass. Gen. Laws ch. 218 §§ 32 - 35A.               On appeal, the Sadlowskis\n\nargue that the court erred in applying issue preclusion because 1)\n\nthe issues were not identical,         2) the parties were not the same,\n\nand 3) plaintiffs did not receive a \"full and fair hearing\" in\n\nstate court.\n\n             We need not resolve the problematic question of whether\n\nissue preclusion applies here, because we affirm on the alternative\n\nground that plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden of showing\n\na genuine issue of material fact as to the claim deemed precluded.\n\nSee Four Corners serv. Station, Inc. v. Mobil Oil Corp., 51 F.3d\n\n306, 314 (1st Cir. 1995) (appellate court is free to affirm summary\n\njudgment   on    any   ground     supported   by    the   record    and    fairly\n\npresented).\n\n             \"Once a defendant moves for summary judgment and places\n\nin issue the question of whether the plaintiff's case is supported\n\nby sufficient evidence, the plaintiff must establish the existence\n\nof a factual controversy that is both genuine and material.                    To\n\ncarry this burden, the plaintiff must 'affirmatively point to\n\nspecific facts that demonstrate the existence of an authentic\n\ndispute.'\" Melanson v. Browning-Ferris Indus., Inc., 281 F.3d 272,\n\n276 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n           In opposing summary judgment, plaintiffs relied upon\n\ndeposition      testimony   and    affidavits      of   Jocelyn    and    Suzanne\n\nSadlowski.      At best, that evidence established a genuine factual\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fcontroversy as to: 1) whether the warrant presented to plaintiffs\n\nat the time of the search was signed by a magistrate and had\n\nJeffrey Sadlowski's name on it, and 2) whether it differed in\n\nformat from the warrant authorizing the search of their home which\n\nwas on file with the Leominster District Court.          However, neither\n\nfactual controversy is material to plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment\n\nclaim.\n\n           The only specific facts set forth by plaintiffs in\n\nsupport   of   their   claim   are   Jocelyn    and   Suzanne   Sadlowski's\n\nrecollections that the warrant they were shown at the time of the\n\nsearch (the \"Served Warrant\") was unsigned, did not contain Jeffrey\n\nSadlowski's name as the occupant, and was different in format from\n\nthe one they viewed several days later on file with the Leominster\n\nDistrict Court (the \"Filed Warrant\"). They also rely upon evidence\n\nindicating that the Filed Warrant contained folds inconsistent with\n\nhow defendant demonstrated he would have folded the Served Warrant.\n\n\n\n           Plaintiffs testified in their depositions that the Served\n\nWarrant included a description of the items to be searched for and\n\nthe place to be searched (the Sadlowskis' home) and they do not\n\ncontest the adequacy of those descriptions. In their opposition to\n\nsummary judgment, plaintiffs specifically denied that they were\n\nalleging that the affidavit submitted in support of the warrant\n\napplication was \"made-up or invalid.\"          The record includes a copy\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fof   the   application     for   the   warrant   to    search   the    Sadlowski\n\nresidence which is dated the day of the search and signed by\n\nAssistant Clerk Magistrate Raymond A. Salmon, Jr.1                    Plaintiffs\n\nhave not argued that the application and affidavit in support\n\nthereof did not establish probable cause to search their home.2\n\n            Under these circumstances, the contested facts identified\n\nby plaintiffs, if proven, would not establish a violation of their\n\nFourth Amendment rights. The lack of a signature on the Served\n\nWarrant would not render the search unconstitutional. See United\n\nStates v. Lipford, 203 F.3d 259, 270 (4th Cir. 2000);                     United\n\nStates v. Kelley, 140 F.3d 596, 602 n. 6 (5th Cir. 1998).                      The\n\nFourth Amendment does not require that a search warrant \"name the\n\nperson from whom the things will be seized.\" Zurcher v. Stanford\n\nDaily, 436 U.S. 547, 555 (1978).          Plaintiffs' contention that the\n\ndefendant did not comply with Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 276, § 3,\n\nprescribing the methods for issuance of a search warrant, is also\n\ninsufficient to support a Fourth Amendment claim. See White v.\n\nOlig, 56 F.3d 817, 820 (7th Cir. 1995). We conclude that there is\n\nno   trialworthy   issue    as   to    this   Fourth   Amendment      claim   and,\n\ntherefore, summary judgment was appropriate.\n\n\n\n      1\n       The record does not include a copy of the supporting\naffidavit which was incorporated in the application.\n      2\n       Plaintiffs' allegation that the affidavit in support of the\nsearch warrant was prepared after the search had been completed is\nentirely unsubstantiated.\n\n                                       -5-\n\fII. Dismissal of Claim that Officer's Threatening Manner Amounted\nto Constitutional Violation\n\n            Appellants challenge the grant of summary judgment on the\n\nclaim that the \"threatening manner\" in which defendant conducted\n\nthe     search     of     Suzanne        Sadlowski's     bedroom       violated        her\n\nconstitutional rights.           Even assuming that defendant's summary\n\njudgment motion did not encompass this claim, \"[i]t is apodictic\n\nthat trial courts have the power to grant summary judgment sua\n\nsponte.\" Rogan v. Menino, 175 F.3d 75, 79 (1st Cir. 1999).                             Two\n\nconditions precedent must be satisfied before a trial court may\n\nenter    summary    judgment        sua    sponte:      \"(1)    the    case     must    be\n\nsufficiently advanced in terms of pretrial discovery for the\n\nsummary judgment        target      to    know   what    evidence      likely    can    be\n\nmustered,    and    (2)    the   target      must    have      received   appropriate\n\nnotice.\"Id.      The ten-day notice requirement of Rule 56 applies to\n\nsua sponte grants of summary judgment. Id. at 80.                     \"In the context\n\nof a sua sponte summary judgment, 'notice' means that the targeted\n\nparty 'had reason to believe the court might reach the issue and\n\nreceived a fair opportunity to put its best foot forward.'\" Leyva\n\nv. On the Beach, Inc., 171 F.3d 717, 720 (1st Cir. 1999) (citation\n\nomitted).\n\n            Here,       both     conditions         precedent         were satisfied.\n\nDiscovery had been underway for more than a year when defendant\n\nmoved for summary judgment. The plaintiffs were given notice as of\n\nthe date of the magistrate judge's Report and Recommendation\n\n                                           -6-\n\f(February 15, 2002) that the court was considering entering summary\n\njudgment as to the \"threatening manner\" claim. In their opposition\n\nto   the   Report,   plaintiffs   could   have   argued   that   there   were\n\ndisputed facts concerning that claim. Instead, they merely pointed\n\nout that defendant had not moved for summary judgment as to that\n\nspecific claim.      Summary judgment entered on March 1, 2002, more\n\nthan ten days after plaintiffs had received notice. Therefore, the\n\ndistrict court did not err in sua sponte entering summary judgment\n\nas to the claim contained in paragraph 6 of the amended complaint.3\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n      3\n       On the merits, appellants do not dispute the district\ncourt's ruling that their allegations \"do not come close to\nestablishing the type of conduct necessary to establish a\nconstitutional   violation,   i.e.,   that  Sgt.    Benoit   acted\nunreasonably.\" Instead, they argue only that defendant's conduct\nviolated Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, §11i.     \"By the terms of the\nstatute itself, a section 1983 claim must be based upon a federal\nright.\" Ahern v. O'Donnell, 109 F.3d 809, 815 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n                                    -7-\n\f",

The plaintiffs were given notice as of\n\nthe date of the magistrate judge's Report and Recommendation\n\n                                           -6-\n\f(February 15, 2002) that the court was considering entering summary\n\njudgment as to the \"threatening manner\" claim. In their opposition\n\nto   the   Report,   plaintiffs   could   have   argued   that   there   were\n\ndisputed facts concerning that claim. Instead, they merely pointed\n\nout that defendant had not moved for summary judgment as to that\n\nspecific claim.      Summary judgment entered on March 1, 2002, more\n\nthan ten days after plaintiffs had received notice. Therefore, the\n\ndistrict court did not err in sua sponte entering summary judgment\n\nas to the claim contained in paragraph 6 of the amended complaint.3\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n      3\n       On the merits, appellants do not dispute the district\ncourt's ruling that their allegations \"do not come close to\nestablishing the type of conduct necessary to establish a\nconstitutional   violation,   i.e.,   that  Sgt.    Benoit   acted\nunreasonably.\" Instead, they argue only that defendant's conduct\nviolated Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, §11i.     \"By the terms of the\nstatute itself, a section 1983 claim must be based upon a federal\nright.\" Ahern v.
