Land-use restrictions often\n\nset neighbor against neighbor, and can be a source of considerable\n\nturmoil in otherwise tranquil communities.    So it is here: Barbara\n\nCordi-Allen and her husband John Allen (the Allens) are landowners\n\nin the Cape Cod town of Truro, Massachusetts (the Town).     They own\n\na waterfront lot and wish to improve it.     They have thus far been\n\nstymied in their efforts by a series of zoning, environmental, and\n\nlicensing restrictions.\n\n           The Allens accuse the Town of singling them out for\n\nunfavorable treatment and thwarting their plans.       The Town, with\n\nequal fervor, accuses the Allens of seeking advantages to which\n\nthey are not entitled.    The ill will has spread like a malignant\n\ngrowth and has come to envelop several of the Allens' neighbors.\n\n           After many years of travail, the Allens elevated the feud\n\nto constitutional proportions: they condensed their grievances into\n\na so-called \"class of one\" claim, alleging that the disparate\n\ntreatment they had received infringed their rights under the Equal\n\nProtection Clause.   See U.S. Const. amend. XIV.    The Town heatedly\n\ndenied these allegations.   The district court sided with the Town\n\nand granted summary judgment in its favor.         See Cordi-Allen v.\n\nConlon, No. 1:05-cv-10370, 2006 WL 2033897, at *8 (D. Mass. July 19,\n\n2006).\n\n           We are called upon to review that order.    In doing so, we\n\ntake the supported facts in the light most          favorable to the\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fnonmovants (here, the Allens).               Cabán Hernández v. Philip Morris\n\nUSA, Inc., 486 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n                 The events surrounding this case are byzantine, and a\n\nfull recitation would serve no useful purpose.            Thus, we offer only\n\na decurtate summary, supplemented as needed in the course of our\n\nanalysis of the relevant legal issues.             We urge readers who hunger\n\nfor more detailed information to consult the district court's\n\ncomprehensive opinion (which even the Allens, at oral argument\n\nbefore us, commended as doing \"a good job of gleaning the facts\").\n\n                 This controversy dates back to March of 1996, when the\n\nAllens purchased a piece of waterfront property in Truro.                   The\n\nparcel abuts properties owned by Brooke Newman, Sarah Landis, and\n\nthe Pamet Harbor Yacht Club.             Other neighbors in relatively close\n\nproximity include the Sextons and the Perrys.\n\n                 The Allens' lot is undersized.      The only improvements on\n\nit as of the date of acquisition were a small 400-square-foot\n\ncottage and a short pier.1         The Allens aspired to build a compound.\n\nTheir plans contemplated erecting a new 1,512-square-foot dwelling\n\nwith an attached 1,750-square-foot garage on a solid foundation with\n\ncrawl space drainage; expanding the existing cottage (originally\n\nbuilt       as   a   boathouse)   into   a   640-square-foot   residence;   and\n\ninstalling a large swimming pool with adjacent decks.                  To top\n\n\n        1\n      The Town subsequently took the tidelands around the pier in\nan eminent domain proceeding. The Allens have retained an easement\nencompassing the pier.\n\n                                          -3-\n\fmatters off, the Allens proposed to install floats as a means of\n\nextending their existing pier.\n\n             A number of disagreements arose with respect to the\n\nAllens' plans. These included disputes about the interpretation and\n\napplication of zoning laws and environmental restrictions.                       The\n\ncontroversy soon extended to the licensing of the proposed floats.\n\n             The   Allens   characterize       all    of   this    as   obstructive\n\nbehavior.    They protest that it stands in stark contrast to the\n\naccommodations      lavished     on   other   residents.          Their   next-door\n\nneighbor, Newman, is the poster child for the claim of unequal\n\ntreatment.    In addition, they insist that Landis, the Sextons, and\n\nthe yacht club all have received more favorable receptions from the\n\nTown.\n\n             Frustrated by these perceived inequities, the Allens\n\nfiled suit in a Massachusetts state court in February of 2005.\n\nTheir complaint contained five counts.               The first, third, fourth,\n\nand fifth counts are not relevant here. The sole count with which\n\nwe are concerned — count 2 — invoked 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and alleged\n\nthat the Town had denied the Allens equal protection of the laws.\n\n             On    the   basis   of    the    equal    protection       claim,   the\n\ndefendants removed the case to the federal district court.                   See 28\n\nU.S.C. §§ 1331, 1441.        In due course, the Town moved for summary\n\njudgment with respect to count 2.             See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.            The\n\ndistrict court concluded that the Allens had not shown that the Town\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fhad treated them differently from similarly situated parties and\n\nentered judgment on the equal protection claim.          See Cordi-Allen,\n\n2006 WL 2033897, at *8.      It then remanded the remaining counts to\n\nthe state court.   See id.; see also 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c).\n\n          This     timely     appeal   ensued.      We   have   appellate\n\njurisdiction notwithstanding the remand.         The rule is that when a\n\ndistrict court enters a final judgment on all the federal claims\n\nthen pending in a civil action and contemporaneously remands all\n\nremaining claims to a state court, immediate appellate review of\n\nthat collateral order is available.        See Christopher v. Stanley-\n\nBostitch, Inc., 240 F.3d 95, 99 (1st Cir. 2001) (per curiam).\n\n          The applicable standard of review is familiar.              We\n\nappraise a grant of summary judgment de novo.        Galloza v. Foy, 389\n\nF.3d 26, 28 (1st Cir. 2004). We are not wed to the district court's\n\nrationale but, rather, may affirm its order on any independent\n\nground made manifest by the record. Houlton Citizens' Coal. v. Town\n\nof Houlton, 175 F.3d 178, 184 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n          To warrant affirmance of an order for summary judgment,\n\nthe record must disclose no genuine issue as to any material fact\n\nand show conclusively that the movant is entitled to judgment as a\n\nmatter of law.   See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).      An issue is genuine if,\n\non the evidence presented, it \"may reasonably be resolved in favor\n\nof either party\" at trial. Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc., 895 F.2d 46,\n\n48 (1st Cir. 1990).         By like token, a fact is material if it\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f\"possess[es] the capacity to sway the outcome of the litigation\n\nunder the applicable law.\"     Cadle Co. v. Hayes, 116 F.3d 957, 960\n\n(1st Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). In the final\n\nanalysis, then, \"[t]he nonmovant may defeat a summary judgment\n\nmotion by demonstrating, through submissions of evidentiary quality,\n\nthat a trialworthy issue persists.\"     Iverson v. City of Boston, 452\n\nF.3d 94, 98 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n           In applying these tenets, we take the facts in the light\n\nmost hospitable to the nonmovant and draw all reasonable inferences\n\nin that party's favor.   Galloza, 389 F.3d at 28.      When doing so,\n\nhowever, we give no weight to conclusory allegations, unsupported\n\nconjecture, or free-wheeling invective.     Id.\n\n           This is a rifle-shot appeal: the only assignment of error\n\nadvanced by the Allens is that the district court blundered in\n\nconcluding that they had not adduced facts sufficient to survive\n\nsummary judgment on their equal protection claim against the Town.2\n\nThat theory runs along the line that the Allens constitute a \"class\n\n\n\n     2\n      The Town insists that it is not a proper target for this\nclaim because a municipality cannot be held liable for the acts of\nits agents or employees under a respondeat superior theory. See\nMonell v. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 691 (1978).\nRelatedly, it argues that the Allens have failed to allege a\nmunicipal custom or policy underlying the putative equal protection\nviolation. See, e.g., Collins v. City of Harker Heights, 503 U.S.\n115, 120-24 (1992).     But the Allens have alleged a series of\npurportedly discriminatory acts undertaken by a number of different\nmunicipal officials, some of whom are high-ranking. Consequently,\nwe assume, for argument's sake, that the Town is a proper\ndefendant.\n\n                                  -6-\n\fof one,\" impermissibly singled out for unfavorable treatment by the\n\nTown.       See Vill. of Willowbrook v. Olech, 528 U.S. 562, 564 (2000)\n\n(per curiam).         Such a claim is cognizable when — and only when — a\n\n\"plaintiff        alleges   that    she    has   been     intentionally        treated\n\ndifferently from others similarly situated and that there is no\n\nrational basis for the difference in treatment.\"                         Id.   At the\n\nsummary judgment stage, of course, this allegation must be backed\n\nby competent evidence.\n\n                 The Allens maintain that they have offered probative\n\nevidence on all the elements that are necessary to forge such a\n\ncause       of   action.3    The    district     court    rejected       the   Allens'\n\nimportunings: it concluded that while the Allens had presented a\n\nplethora of evidence concerning a number of other landowners, they\n\nhad failed to show that these landowners were similarly situated to\n\nthem.       The main thrust of the Allens' appeal is the claim that the\n\ndistrict court \"erred in placing [a] burden on the Allens [that]\n\nshould have been placed upon the moving party\" with respect to this\n\nissue.       Appellants' Br. at 20.\n\n                 In   evaluating   this   argument,      we   do   not   write   on   a\n\npristine page.          Although \"[t]he formula for determining whether\n\n\n        3\n      We need not reach any question of whether, post-Olech, a\nplaintiff must demonstrate malice or bad faith intent to injure\nwhen there is no discrimination based on typically impermissible\ncategories.  See Bizzarro v. Miranda, 394 F.3d 82, 88 (2d Cir.\n2005). For present purposes, it suffices to say that the Allens\nfail to satisfy the \"similarly situated\" requirement. See text\ninfra.\n\n                                          -7-\n\findividuals        or   entities   are    'similarly     situated'    for     equal\n\nprotection     purposes      is    not    always     susceptible     to     precise\n\ndemarcation,\" Barrington Cove Ltd. P'ship v. R.I. Hous. & Mortg.\n\nFin. Corp., 246 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2001), the case law makes clear\n\nthat the burdens of production and persuasion must be shouldered by\n\nthe   party    asserting     the     equal     protection    violation.       Thus,\n\n\"[p]laintiffs claiming an equal protection violation must first\n\nidentify and relate specific instances where persons situated\n\nsimilarly     in    all   relevant    aspects     were   treated   differently.\"\n\nBuchanan v. Maine, 469 F.3d 158, 178 (1st Cir. 2006) (emphasis in\n\noriginal) (internal quotation mark omitted).\n\n              The Allens also argue that, regardless of the allocation\n\nof burdens, the district court demanded more of them than the law\n\nallows.     In their view, the degree of similarity between their\n\nsituation and the situations of the landowners whom they identified\n\nas comparators was, on the evidence adduced, a question of material\n\nfact that should have been left to a jury.                  This argument cannot\n\nwithstand scrutiny.\n\n              To be sure, the ultimate determination as to whether\n\nparties are similarly situated is a fact-bound inquiry and, as such,\n\nis normally grist for the jury's mill.             But that does not mean that\n\nevery case, regardless of the proof presented, is a jury case.                  To\n\ncarry the burden of proving substantial similarity, \"plaintiffs must\n\nshow an extremely high degree of similarity between themselves and\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fthe persons to whom they compare themselves.\"            Clubside, Inc. v.\n\nValentin, 468 F.3d 144, 159 (2d Cir. 2006).           While the applicable\n\nstandard does not require that there be an \"[e]xact correlation,\"\n\nTapalian v. Tusino, 377 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2004), there must be\n\nsufficient proof on the relevant aspects of the comparison to\n\nwarrant a reasonable inference of substantial similarity.4              Thus,\n\nthe proponent of the equal protection violation must show that the\n\nparties with whom he seeks to be compared have engaged in the same\n\nactivity vis-à-vis the government entity without such distinguishing\n\nor mitigating circumstances as would render the comparison inutile.\n\nSee Perkins v. Brigham & Women's Hosp., 78 F.3d 747, 751 (1st Cir.\n\n1996).\n\n           The \"similarly situated\" requirement must be enforced\n\nwith   particular   rigor   in   the    land-use   context   because   zoning\n\ndecisions \"will often, perhaps almost always, treat one landowner\n\ndifferently from another.\"        Olech, 528 U.S. at 565 (Breyer, J.,\n\nconcurring).   Given this template, virtually every zoning decision\n\n— in the absence of a sensible limiting principle — would be a\n\ncandidate to find its way to federal court in the guise of an equal\n\nprotection claim.    Cf. Creative Env'ts, Inc. v. Estabrook, 680 F.2d\n\n\n\n       4\n      We note that the degree of similarity required may be relaxed\nsomewhat if the plaintiff has presented evidence of \"personal\nmalice and 'bad faith' retaliation.\"     Tapalian, 377 F.3d at 7.\nThus, while we do not reach whether a class of one suit may be\nmaintained in the absence of malice, see supra note 3, evidence of\nmalice is always relevant.\n\n                                       -9-\n\f822,   833   (1st Cir. 1982) (warning that \"[e]very appeal by a\n\ndisappointed developer from an adverse ruling by a local . . .\n\nplanning board necessarily involves some claim that the board\n\nexceeded, abused or 'distorted' its legal authority in some manner\"\n\nand can be given a constitutional label) (emphasis in original).\n\nThe    \"similarly   situated\"   requirement     furnishes    the   limiting\n\nprinciple that guards against such a devolution.\n\n             This requirement demands more than lip service.         It is\n\nmeant to be \"a very significant burden.\"        Discovery House, Inc. v.\n\nConsol. City of Indianapolis, 319 F.3d 277, 283 (7th Cir. 2003); see\n\nCreative Env'ts, 680 F.2d at 883 (explaining that it is not enough\n\nto give land use \"claims constitutional labels such as 'due process'\n\nor 'equal protection' in order to raise a substantial federal\n\nquestion under section 1983\").     It is inadequate merely to point to\n\nnearby parcels in a vacuum and leave it to the municipality to\n\ndisprove conclusory allegations that the owners of those parcels are\n\nsimilarly situated.\n\n             Seen against this background, \"a court can properly grant\n\nsummary judgment where it is clear that no reasonable jury could\n\nfind the similarly situated prong met.\"          Harlen Assocs. v. Inc.\n\nVill. of Mineola, 273 F.3d 494, 499 (2d Cir. 2001); see McDonald v.\n\nVill. of Winnetka, 371 F.3d 992, 1002 (7th Cir. 2004).                 That\n\nprinciple may apply even though, as in this case, the plaintiffs\n\nhave   presented    copious   evidence    concerning   a   multiplicity   of\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fpossible comparisons.      See, e.g., Bell v. Duperrault, 367 F.3d 703,\n\n708 (7th Cir. 2004); cf. Barrington Cove, 246 F.3d at 8-9 (upholding\n\ngrant of Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss when plaintiff failed to\n\nestablish similarity with \"reasonable particularity\" and the facts\n\nalleged    suggested    \"entirely   reasonable\"   grounds   for   disparate\n\ntreatment).\n\n             With this framework in place, we return to the case at\n\nhand. The Allens emphasize that they are subject to the same zoning\n\nand environmental strictures as their neighbors and argue that any\n\nmaterial discrepancy in outcomes must, a fortiori, be a result of\n\nunequal application of the law.       But casting the argument in those\n\nterms oversimplifies the analysis and fails to account for the fact\n\nthat     \"[v]arious    factual   traits,   circumstantial   nuances,    and\n\npeculiarities can set entities apart, rendering them, by virtue of\n\ntheir differences, amenable to disparate treatment.\" Racine Charter\n\nOne, Inc. v. Racine Unified Sch. Dist., 424 F.3d 677, 681 (7th Cir.\n\n2005).\n\n             The burden that a class of one plaintiff must carry at\n\nthe summary judgment stage is considerably heavier than a mere\n\nshowing that others have applied, with more auspicious results, for\n\nthe same benefit that he seeks. See Jennings v. City of Stillwater,\n\n383 F.3d 1199, 1214 (10th Cir. 2004); see also Clubside, 468 F.3d\n\nat 159 (describing a plaintiff's burden at summary judgment in a\n\nclass of one case as \"more stringent than that used at summary\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fjudgment in the employment discrimination context\").               Were the law\n\notherwise,    the   federal    court    would     be   transmogrified     into   a\n\nsupercharged version of a local zoning board — a zoning board on\n\nsteroids, as it were.\n\n             Thus, the Allens — in order to show that other parties\n\nwere   similarly    situated   to   them      —   needed   to   adduce   evidence\n\nsufficient to establish factual as well as regulatory similarity.\n\nClose perscrutation of the record readily indicates that they failed\n\nto fulfill this obligation.             We explicate this conclusion by\n\nspecific reference to the four principal instances upon which the\n\nAllens rely in their effort to show that the Town singled them out\n\nfor disparate treatment.\n\n             First, the Allens lament that the town counsel informed\n\nthem that, due to their undersized lot, they would be required to\n\nseek a variance or special permit as a precondition to proceeding\n\nwith the construction of their planned compound.5                 They contrast\n\nthis with the Town's issuance of a building permit to Newman for her\n\nundersized lot without first requiring a similar dispensation from\n\nthe zoning board.\n\n             This comparison is inapt; the scale of the two projects\n\nwas dramatically different. The Allens' proposed improvements were\n\nmuch more ambitious than those undertaken by Newman, and materially\n\n\n\n       5\n      The Allens have stoutly resisted this ultimatum; they have\nnever applied for a variance or special permit.\n\n                                       -12-\n\fdifferent projects may be treated differently by zoning or planning\n\nboards without raising constitutional concerns.          In this instance,\n\nit was not irrational for a municipality to conclude that a proposal\n\nto relocate an existing residence while expanding the footprint by\n\n90 square feet (as Newman desired) should be treated differently\n\nthan a proposal involving the construction of a brand-new 3,000-\n\nsquare-foot structure, the substantial expansion of an existing\n\nbuilding, and the installation of a large pool and deck area.             See\n\nCampbell v. Rainbow City, 434 F.3d 1306, 1316 n.8 (11th Cir. 2006)\n\n(noting that the degree of non-conformity with a zoning rule is a\n\nvalid basis for classifying properties as not similarly situated);\n\nBarstad v. Murray County, 420 F.3d 880, 886 (8th Cir. 2005)\n\n(distinguishing   the   expansion    of   an   existing    use     from   the\n\nconstruction of a new facility); see also Bell, 367 F.3d at 707-08\n\n(observing that the construction of new structures may be dissimilar\n\nfrom the replacement of existing structures).           This is especially\n\ntrue in a community which, like Truro, has a zoning rule that allows\n\nfor the issuance of a building permit without leave from the zoning\n\nboard when the building commissioner determines that a proposed\n\nchange   will   \"not    increase    the   nature   or     extent    of    the\n\nnonconformity.\"   Truro Zoning Bylaw § VII.B.2.6\n\n\n     6\n      The Allens point to correspondence in which the town counsel\nsuggested that even had the Allens proposed a less ambitious\nproject, they would still have been required to seek special\npermission from the zoning board. The Allens concede, however,\nthat they never submitted a scaled-down proposal. Consequently, we\n\n                                   -13-\n\f             We add a coda.         In the land-use context, timing is\n\ncritical and, thus, can supply an important basis for differential\n\ntreatment.      Since zoning       bylaws, environmental standards, and\n\nlicensing criteria may change over time, courts must be sensitive\n\nto   the   possibility     that    differential     treatment    —   especially\n\ndifferential treatment following a time lag — may indicate a change\n\nin policy rather than an intent to discriminate. See Purze v. Vill.\n\nof   Winthrop    Harbor,     286    F.3d     452,   455   (7th   Cir.   2002).\n\nConsequently, the most reliable comparisons are likely to be from\n\nroughly the same time frame.\n\n             There is reason to think that temporal disparities may be\n\nrelevant here. Newman received her building permit in 1998, whereas\n\nthe Allens were referred to the zoning board in 2002.                Moreover,\n\nLandis (also the owner of an undersized lot), constructed a 750-\n\nsquare-foot addition to her home only after obtaining a special\n\npermit from the zoning board in 2003.           This chronology weakens the\n\ninference that Newman and the Allens are fair congeners.\n\n             A second exemplar put forth by the Allens involves the\n\nTruro Conservation Commission.         The Commission determined that the\n\nAllens' property rests on a coastal dune.           The Allens contrast this\n\n\n\n\nneed not speculate about what might have happened if they had. See\nRhode Island v. Narragansett Indian Tribe, 19 F.3d 685, 705 (1st\nCir. 1994) (noting that federal courts do not deal in hypothetical\nquestions).\n\n                                      -14-\n\fdesignation   with   the   Town's   designation   of   Newman's   abutting\n\nproperty as being located on a coastal bank.7\n\n           The difference in nomenclature is not inconsequential;\n\nthe presence of a coastal dune imports stringent environmental\n\nsafeguards and building restrictions.         Among other things, the\n\ndesignation negates a landowner's ability to build on a solid\n\nfoundation rather than on pilings (a course that the Allens wished\n\nto pursue) and adversely affects the landowner's right to install\n\ncertain types of septic systems.\n\n           Once again, the Allens' plaint is without merit.         While\n\nit is true that the Town allowed Newman to proceed on the basis that\n\nher property was situated on a coastal bank and, thus, could be\n\nconstructed with a crawl-space drainage system rather than on\n\npilings, the Town's subsequent conduct has been consistent with its\n\ntreatment of the Allens.       In particular, the Landis, Sexton, and\n\nPerry additions all have been required to employ pilings as opposed\n\nto solid foundations.      Because the Town's opposition to the Allens'\n\nefforts to build on a solid foundation is in no way anomalous or\n\ninconsistent, the Allens are not part of a class of one vis-à-vis\n\nthe \"coastal dune\" designation.8      By definition, a class of one is\n\n\n     7\n      The district court found this claim to be time-barred, but\nproceeded to resolve it on the merits. See Cordi-Allen, 2006 WL\n2033897, at *6-7. We take no view of the time bar issue, preferring\ninstead to address the merits.\n     8\n      The Allens make much of the fact that the Sextons have been\nallowed to keep a pre-existing solid retaining wall. We think that\n\n                                    -15-\n\fnot a class of many.           Cf. Campbell, 434 F.3d at 1317 (explaining\n\nthat a class of one suit cannot be maintained when similar burdens\n\nhave been imposed on other individuals).\n\n                 As a third exemplar, the Allens offer some desultory\n\ncharges that the Town has gone to a Massachusetts state court to\n\nappeal      an   approval    that    they    received    from   the    Massachusetts\n\nDepartment of Environmental Protection (DEP) regarding a proposed\n\nseptic system.           They aver that this is an instance of unequal\n\ntreatment because the Town has not appealed such an approval in any\n\nother case.\n\n                 This is whistling past the graveyard.              The Allens do not\n\noffer a shred of evidence to support the allegation of disparate\n\ntreatment; for aught that appears, there never had been a comparable\n\ncase.       Given this dearth of evidence, we find that the wrangling\n\nover the septic system does not reveal any arbitrary divergence from\n\nthe Town's conduct toward other similarly situated individuals.9\n\nSee Bell, 367 F.3d at 708 (noting that \"speculation and conjecture\"\n\nwill    not      allow   a   class   of   one      plaintiff   to   survive    summary\n\njudgment).\n\n                 The Allens' final exemplar involves floats.                  They say\n\nthat the Town refused to license floats designed to extend their\n\n\nfact is of no moment.           The relevant point of analysis is new home\nconstruction.\n        9\n      In any event, the record reflects that the Town has succeeded\nin persuading the DEP that the approval was granted in error.\n\n                                            -16-\n\fpier despite having licensed such floats for the nearby yacht club.\n\nThe district court rejected this argument, noting that the Allens'\n\nrequest for licensure, unlike that of the yacht club, had been\n\ndenied at an earlier time by the DEP and the Army Corp of Engineers.\n\nSee Cordi-Allen, 2006 WL 2033897, at *8.\n\n             On     appeal,     the    Allens      have    offered      no   developed\n\nargumentation elaborating the claim that they are similarly situated\n\nto the yacht club.           We could reject their claim on this ground\n\nalone. See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990)\n\n(holding    that     \"issues     adverted     to    in     a   perfunctory     manner,\n\nunaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed\n\nwaived\").    Here, moreover, the record reflects a wholly rational\n\nexplanation for the disparate treatment.                  Thus, the Allens plainly\n\nhave not carried their burden of demonstrating that they are\n\nsimilarly situated to the yacht club.               See Bell, 367 F.3d at 708.\n\n             Before concluding our analysis, we add a postscript.                    At\n\noral argument in this court, the Allens protested that a strict\n\ninterpretation       of   the    \"similarly       situated\"       requirement    —   an\n\ninterpretation to which we have adhered in this and earlier cases\n\n—   would   limit    class      of   one   land-use      claims    to   circumstances\n\ninvolving attempts to build identical                     structures on identical\n\nparcels.     This criticism is unjustified.                    The test, properly\n\nunderstood, does not demand identicality.                  It simply requires that\n\nclass of one plaintiffs demonstrate that their comparators are\n\n\n                                           -17-\n\fsimilar in relevant respects.             See Barrington Cove, 246 F.3d at 8.\n\nThe Allens have fallen well short of that mark.\n\n               We need go no further.            The Olech class of one suit\n\nserves an important but relatively narrow function.                      It is not a\n\nvehicle for federalizing run-of-the-mine zoning, environmental, and\n\nlicensing decisions. In this instance, the Allens — with their eyes\n\nwide open — purchased an undersized lot in an ecologically sensitive\n\narea.    They could not reasonably have expected to have a free hand\n\nin developing the property. While the record reflects that the Town\n\nhas    not    been    particularly   accommodating,       the     Allens    have   not\n\npresented probative evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue\n\nof material fact as to the existence of disparate treatment between\n\nthem    and    other    similarly    situated      persons.       Accordingly,     the\n\ndistrict court did not err in entering summary judgment for the Town\n\non the equal protection claim.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.            Costs   shall   be    taxed     in   favor     of     the   Town.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -18-\n\f",

Land-use restrictions often\n\nset neighbor against neighbor, and can be a source of considerable\n\nturmoil in otherwise tranquil communities.    So it is here: Barbara\n\nCordi-Allen and her husband John Allen (the Allens) are landowners\n\nin the Cape Cod town of Truro, Massachusetts (the Town).     They own\n\na waterfront lot and wish to improve it.     They have thus far been\n\nstymied in their efforts by a series of zoning, environmental, and\n\nlicensing restrictions.\n\n           The Allens accuse the Town of singling them out for\n\nunfavorable treatment and thwarting their plans.       The Town, with\n\nequal fervor, accuses the Allens of seeking advantages to which\n\nthey are not entitled.    The ill will has spread like a malignant\n\ngrowth and has come to envelop several of the Allens' neighbors.\n\n           After many years of travail, the Allens elevated the feud\n\nto constitutional proportions: they condensed their grievances into\n\na so-called \"class of one\" claim, alleging that the disparate\n\ntreatment they had received infringed their rights under the Equal\n\nProtection Clause.   See U.S. Const. amend. XIV.    The Town heatedly\n\ndenied these allegations.   The district court sided with the Town\n\nand granted summary judgment in its favor.

Thus, we offer only\n\na decurtate summary, supplemented as needed in the course of our\n\nanalysis of the relevant legal issues.             We urge readers who hunger\n\nfor more detailed information to consult the district court's\n\ncomprehensive opinion (which even the Allens, at oral argument\n\nbefore us, commended as doing \"a good job of gleaning the facts\").\n\n                 This controversy dates back to March of 1996, when the\n\nAllens purchased a piece of waterfront property in Truro.                   The\n\nparcel abuts properties owned by Brooke Newman, Sarah Landis, and\n\nthe Pamet Harbor Yacht Club.             Other neighbors in relatively close\n\nproximity include the Sextons and the Perrys.\n\n                 The Allens' lot is undersized.      The only improvements on\n\nit as of the date of acquisition were a small 400-square-foot\n\ncottage and a short pier.1         The Allens aspired to build a compound.\n\nTheir plans contemplated erecting a new 1,512-square-foot dwelling\n\nwith an attached 1,750-square-foot garage on a solid foundation with\n\ncrawl space drainage; expanding the existing cottage (originally\n\nbuilt       as   a   boathouse)   into   a   640-square-foot   residence;   and\n\ninstalling a large swimming pool with adjacent decks.                  To top\n\n\n        1\n      The Town subsequently took the tidelands around the pier in\nan eminent domain proceeding. The Allens have retained an easement\nencompassing the pier.\n\n                                          -3-\n\fmatters off, the Allens proposed to install floats as a means of\n\nextending their existing pier.\n\n             A number of disagreements arose with respect to the\n\nAllens' plans. These included disputes about the interpretation and\n\napplication of zoning laws and environmental restrictions.                       The\n\ncontroversy soon extended to the licensing of the proposed floats.\n\n             The   Allens   characterize       all    of   this    as   obstructive\n\nbehavior.    They protest that it stands in stark contrast to the\n\naccommodations      lavished     on   other   residents.          Their   next-door\n\nneighbor, Newman, is the poster child for the claim of unequal\n\ntreatment.    In addition, they insist that Landis, the Sextons, and\n\nthe yacht club all have received more favorable receptions from the\n\nTown.\n\n             Frustrated by these perceived inequities, the Allens\n\nfiled suit in a Massachusetts state court in February of 2005.\n\nTheir complaint contained five counts.               The first, third, fourth,\n\nand fifth counts are not relevant here. The sole count with which\n\nwe are concerned — count 2 — invoked 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and alleged\n\nthat the Town had denied the Allens equal protection of the laws.\n\n             On    the   basis   of    the    equal    protection       claim,   the\n\ndefendants removed the case to the federal district court.                   See 28\n\nU.S.C. §§ 1331, 1441.        In due course, the Town moved for summary\n\njudgment with respect to count 2.             See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.            The\n\ndistrict court concluded that the Allens had not shown that the Town\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fhad treated them differently from similarly situated parties and\n\nentered judgment on the equal protection claim.

Were the law\n\notherwise,    the   federal    court    would     be   transmogrified     into   a\n\nsupercharged version of a local zoning board — a zoning board on\n\nsteroids, as it were.\n\n             Thus, the Allens — in order to show that other parties\n\nwere   similarly    situated   to   them      —   needed   to   adduce   evidence\n\nsufficient to establish factual as well as regulatory similarity.\n\nClose perscrutation of the record readily indicates that they failed\n\nto fulfill this obligation.             We explicate this conclusion by\n\nspecific reference to the four principal instances upon which the\n\nAllens rely in their effort to show that the Town singled them out\n\nfor disparate treatment.\n\n             First, the Allens lament that the town counsel informed\n\nthem that, due to their undersized lot, they would be required to\n\nseek a variance or special permit as a precondition to proceeding\n\nwith the construction of their planned compound.5                 They contrast\n\nthis with the Town's issuance of a building permit to Newman for her\n\nundersized lot without first requiring a similar dispensation from\n\nthe zoning board.\n\n             This comparison is inapt; the scale of the two projects\n\nwas dramatically different. The Allens' proposed improvements were\n\nmuch more ambitious than those undertaken by Newman, and materially\n\n\n\n       5\n      The Allens have stoutly resisted this ultimatum; they have\nnever applied for a variance or special permit.\n\n                                       -12-\n\fdifferent projects may be treated differently by zoning or planning\n\nboards without raising constitutional concerns.          In this instance,\n\nit was not irrational for a municipality to conclude that a proposal\n\nto relocate an existing residence while expanding the footprint by\n\n90 square feet (as Newman desired) should be treated differently\n\nthan a proposal involving the construction of a brand-new 3,000-\n\nsquare-foot structure, the substantial expansion of an existing\n\nbuilding, and the installation of a large pool and deck area.

This is especially\n\ntrue in a community which, like Truro, has a zoning rule that allows\n\nfor the issuance of a building permit without leave from the zoning\n\nboard when the building commissioner determines that a proposed\n\nchange   will   \"not    increase    the   nature   or     extent    of    the\n\nnonconformity.\"   Truro Zoning Bylaw § VII.B.2.6\n\n\n     6\n      The Allens point to correspondence in which the town counsel\nsuggested that even had the Allens proposed a less ambitious\nproject, they would still have been required to seek special\npermission from the zoning board. The Allens concede, however,\nthat they never submitted a scaled-down proposal. Consequently, we\n\n                                   -13-\n\f             We add a coda.         In the land-use context, timing is\n\ncritical and, thus, can supply an important basis for differential\n\ntreatment.      Since zoning       bylaws, environmental standards, and\n\nlicensing criteria may change over time, courts must be sensitive\n\nto   the   possibility     that    differential     treatment    —   especially\n\ndifferential treatment following a time lag — may indicate a change\n\nin policy rather than an intent to discriminate.

Newman received her building permit in 1998, whereas\n\nthe Allens were referred to the zoning board in 2002.                Moreover,\n\nLandis (also the owner of an undersized lot), constructed a 750-\n\nsquare-foot addition to her home only after obtaining a special\n\npermit from the zoning board in 2003.           This chronology weakens the\n\ninference that Newman and the Allens are fair congeners.\n\n             A second exemplar put forth by the Allens involves the\n\nTruro Conservation Commission.         The Commission determined that the\n\nAllens' property rests on a coastal dune.           The Allens contrast this\n\n\n\n\nneed not speculate about what might have happened if they had.

Among other things, the\n\ndesignation negates a landowner's ability to build on a solid\n\nfoundation rather than on pilings (a course that the Allens wished\n\nto pursue) and adversely affects the landowner's right to install\n\ncertain types of septic systems.\n\n           Once again, the Allens' plaint is without merit.         While\n\nit is true that the Town allowed Newman to proceed on the basis that\n\nher property was situated on a coastal bank and, thus, could be\n\nconstructed with a crawl-space drainage system rather than on\n\npilings, the Town's subsequent conduct has been consistent with its\n\ntreatment of the Allens.       In particular, the Landis, Sexton, and\n\nPerry additions all have been required to employ pilings as opposed\n\nto solid foundations.      Because the Town's opposition to the Allens'\n\nefforts to build on a solid foundation is in no way anomalous or\n\ninconsistent, the Allens are not part of a class of one vis-à-vis\n\nthe \"coastal dune\" designation.8      By definition, a class of one is\n\n\n     7\n      The district court found this claim to be time-barred, but\nproceeded to resolve it on the merits.

We take no view of the time bar issue, preferring\ninstead to address the merits.\n     8\n      The Allens make much of the fact that the Sextons have been\nallowed to keep a pre-existing solid retaining wall. We think that\n\n                                    -15-\n\fnot a class of many.           Cf. Campbell, 434 F.3d at 1317 (explaining\n\nthat a class of one suit cannot be maintained when similar burdens\n\nhave been imposed on other individuals).\n\n                 As a third exemplar, the Allens offer some desultory\n\ncharges that the Town has gone to a Massachusetts state court to\n\nappeal      an   approval    that    they    received    from   the    Massachusetts\n\nDepartment of Environmental Protection (DEP) regarding a proposed\n\nseptic system.           They aver that this is an instance of unequal\n\ntreatment because the Town has not appealed such an approval in any\n\nother case.\n\n                 This is whistling past the graveyard.              The Allens do not\n\noffer a shred of evidence to support the allegation of disparate\n\ntreatment; for aught that appears, there never had been a comparable\n\ncase.       Given this dearth of evidence, we find that the wrangling\n\nover the septic system does not reveal any arbitrary divergence from\n\nthe Town's conduct toward other similarly situated individuals.9\n\nSee Bell, 367 F.3d at 708 (noting that \"speculation and conjecture\"\n\nwill    not      allow   a   class   of   one      plaintiff   to   survive    summary\n\njudgment).\n\n                 The Allens' final exemplar involves floats.                  They say\n\nthat the Town refused to license floats designed to extend their\n\n\nfact is of no moment.           The relevant point of analysis is new home\nconstruction.\n        9\n      In any event, the record reflects that the Town has succeeded\nin persuading the DEP that the approval was granted in error.\n\n                                            -16-\n\fpier despite having licensed such floats for the nearby yacht club.\n\nThe district court rejected this argument, noting that the Allens'\n\nrequest for licensure, unlike that of the yacht club, had been\n\ndenied at an earlier time by the DEP and the Army Corp of Engineers.\n\nSee Cordi-Allen, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2033897</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *8.\n\n             On     appeal,     the    Allens      have    offered      no   developed\n\nargumentation elaborating the claim that they are similarly situated\n\nto the yacht club.           We could reject their claim on this ground\n\nalone. See United States v. Zannino, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 17 (1st Cir. 1990)\n\n(holding    that     \"issues     adverted     to    in     a   perfunctory     manner,\n\nunaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed\n\nwaived\").    Here, moreover, the record reflects a wholly rational\n\nexplanation for the disparate treatment.                  Thus, the Allens plainly\n\nhave not carried their burden of demonstrating that they are\n\nsimilarly situated to the yacht club.               See Bell, 367 F.3d at 708.\n\n             Before concluding our analysis, we add a postscript.                    At\n\noral argument in this court, the Allens protested that a strict\n\ninterpretation       of   the    \"similarly       situated\"       requirement    —   an\n\ninterpretation to which we have adhered in this and earlier cases\n\n—   would   limit    class      of   one   land-use      claims    to   circumstances\n\ninvolving attempts to build identical                     structures on identical\n\nparcels.     This criticism is unjustified.                    The test, properly\n\nunderstood, does not demand identicality.                  It simply requires that\n\nclass of one plaintiffs demonstrate that their comparators are\n\n\n                                           -17-\n\fsimilar in relevant respects.             See Barrington Cove, 246 F.3d at 8.\n\nThe Allens have fallen well short of that mark.\n\n               We need go no further.            The Olech class of one suit\n\nserves an important but relatively narrow function.                      It is not a\n\nvehicle for federalizing run-of-the-mine zoning, environmental, and\n\nlicensing decisions. In this instance, the Allens — with their eyes\n\nwide open — purchased an undersized lot in an ecologically sensitive\n\narea.    They could not reasonably have expected to have a free hand\n\nin developing the property. While the record reflects that the Town\n\nhas    not    been    particularly   accommodating,       the     Allens    have   not\n\npresented probative evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue\n\nof material fact as to the existence of disparate treatment between\n\nthem    and    other    similarly    situated      persons.       Accordingly,     the\n\ndistrict court did not err in entering summary judgment for the Town\n\non the equal protection claim.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.            Costs   shall   be    taxed     in   favor     of     the   Town.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -18-\n\f</pre>",
