F. Dennis Saylor, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                    Torruella, Lynch and Lipez,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Mark E. Howard and Kacavas Ramsdell & Howard, PLLC, on brief\nfor appellant.\n     Leah B. Foley, Assistant U.S. Attorney, and Michael J.\nSullivan, United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                            April 14, 2008\n\f          Per Curiam.   After being convicted by a jury of various\n\ndrug and gun offenses and after being sentenced to 30 years'\n\nimprisonment, defendant appeals from his conviction and sentence.\n\nAs to his conviction, he argues that the evidence was insufficient\n\nto convict him of two counts in the indictment.           As to his\n\nsentence, he disputes the court's finding that the drug involved\n\nwas crack cocaine as opposed to some other form of cocaine base,\n\nand he argues that the sentence was longer than necessary to serve\n\nthe purposes of sentencing and was inadequately explained. For the\n\nreasons discussed below, we affirm the conviction and sentence.\n\n          Defendant was initially indicted on a single count of\n\ndistributing at least five grams of crack cocaine, in violation of\n\n21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1), and aiding and abetting others in doing so,\n\nin violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2.         That indictment arose from a\n\n\"controlled buy\" by an undercover agent on February 23, 2005, and\n\nwas sealed pending defendant's arrest.\n\n          On April 6, 2005, in the course of defendant's arrest on\n\nthat   initial   indictment,   another   incident   occurred,   which\n\nultimately gave rise to a superseding indictment, adding three\n\nadditional counts:   possession with intent to distribute at least\n\nfive grams of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1);\n\npossession of a firearm \"in furtherance of\" that drug trafficking\n\noffense, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1); and possession of\n\na firearm after being convicted of another felony, in violation of\n\n                                 -2-\n\f18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1).     A second superseding indictment later\n\neliminated all references to \"crack cocaine\" from the drug counts,\n\ncharging only that the drug involved was \"cocaine base.\"\n\n          After a four-day jury trial, defendant was convicted on\n\nall four counts.    He was subsequently sentenced to 30 years'\n\nimprisonment, five years below the applicable guideline sentencing\n\nrange.   We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying\n\nfacts and so will not rehearse them here, except in the context of\n\ndiscussing the legal issues raised on appeal.\n\n          Defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence\n\nsupporting the jury's verdict on three points.1    With respect to\n\nthe charge of possession of cocaine base with intent to distribute,\n\narising from the incident of April 6, 2005, he argues that there\n\nwas insufficient evidence that he knew that the drugs were in the\n\ncar or that he intended to distribute them.     With respect to the\n\ncharge of possession of a firearm \"in furtherance of\" that drug\n\ncharge, he argues that there was insufficient evidence that the\n\nfirearms were possessed \"to advance or promote\" the drug offense.\n\nUnited States v. Grace, 367 F.3d 29, 35 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n          \"The familiar standard that applies to sufficiency-of-\n\nthe-evidence challenges requires that a court 'determine whether,\n\n\n\n     1\n      He expressly concedes that the evidence was sufficient to\nprove beyond a reasonable doubt that he distributed cocaine base on\nFebruary 23, 2005, and that he was a felon in possession of a\nfirearm on April 6, 2005.\n\n                               -3-\n\fafter assaying all the evidence in the light most amiable to the\n\ngovernment, and taking all reasonable inferences in its favor, a\n\nrational factfinder could find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the\n\nprosecution successfully proved the essential elements of the\n\ncrime.'\"     United States v. Dwinells, 508 F.3d 63, 72 (1st Cir.\n\n2007) (quoting United States v. O'Brien, 14 F.3d 703, 706 (1st Cir.\n\n1994)).     \"When the record is fairly susceptible of two competing\n\nscenarios, the choice between those scenarios ordinarily is for the\n\njury.\"     Id. at 74.   Accordingly, if \"the evidence, taken in its\n\nentirety,    supports   the   judgment    of   conviction   .   .   .,   '[the\n\ngovernment] need not rule out other hypotheses more congenial to a\n\nfinding of innocence.'\"       Id. (quoting United States v. Gifford, 17\n\nF.3d 462, 467 (1st Cir. 1994)).\n\n            Under those standards, defendant's sufficiency challenge\n\nfails on all three points. The jury could have reasonably inferred\n\nthat defendant knew that the drugs were in the car from the\n\nuncontroverted evidence that he was previously involved in drug\n\ndealing, United States v. Spinosa, 982 F.2d 620, 628-29 (1st Cir.\n\n1992), including the incident of February 23, 2005; that he was the\n\ndriver and sole occupant of the car in which the drugs were found,\n\nUnited States v. Sanchez, 943 F.2d 110, 115 (1st Cir. 1991); that\n\nthe drugs were found right in front of the driver's seat, United\n\nStates v. Zavala Maldonado, 23 F.3d 4, 8 (1st Cir. 1994); and that\n\nwhen the police confronted him and directed him to pull over, he\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fattempted to flee, first by car and then on foot, and then\n\nviolently struggled to avoid arrest, showing his awareness of\n\nguilt, United States v. Isler, 429 F.3d 19, 25 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nSee generally United States v. Robinson, 473 F.3d 387, 399 (1st\n\nCir. 2007) (holding that knowing possession may be inferred from\n\ncircumstantial evidence).             The jury could well have found that\n\nevidence to outweigh the evidence pointing the other way--primarily\n\nthat the car was registered to someone else--particularly since\n\ndefendant was known to frequent the address to which the car was\n\nregistered.\n\n               The jury could also have reasonably inferred that the\n\ndrugs found in the car--44.3 grams of cocaine base, packaged in the\n\nform of twelve \"eight balls\"2--were intended for distribution\n\nrather than personal use.         There was expert testimony that such a\n\nlarge       amount,   packaged   in    that   manner,   would   ordinarily   be\n\npossessed by a dealer rather than an end-user.              United States v.\n\nGarcía-Carrasquillo, 483 F.3d 124, 130 n.12 (1st Cir. 2007).             That\n\ninference is further supported by the presence in the car of guns,\n\nUnited States v. Andrade, 94 F.3d 9, 13 (1st Cir. 1996), which, the\n\nexpert testimony showed, are often used by drug dealers to avoid\n\ninterference with drug transactions, and by the absence of any\n\nimplements with which to smoke the crack, id.\n\n\n        2\n      There was testimony at trial that an eight ball weighs about\none-eighth of an ounce, 3.5 grams, and that the street price for an\neight ball in the area at the time was about $150 to $200.\n\n                                        -5-\n\f             Finally, there was ample evidence from which the jury\n\nreasonably could have inferred that defendant possessed one or two\n\nguns \"in furtherance\" of the April 6th drug offense.                 Although\n\n\"mere presence\" of the guns at the scene of the drug offense is not\n\nsufficient, United States v. Delgado-Hernandez, 420 F.3d 16, 25\n\n(1st Cir. 2005), there was more here, albeit circumstantial.                In\n\nparticular, the evidence showed that both guns were loaded and\n\nlocated in close proximity to the defendant and to the drugs and\n\ntherefore could easily have been used to resist any effort, by the\n\npolice or others, to interfere with the intended drug distribution.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Robinson, 473 F.3d at 399-400 (finding\n\nsuch evidence sufficient to show that a gun was possessed \"in\n\nfurtherance of\" another crime);          United States v. Felton, 417 F.3d\n\n97,   105,   106   (1st   Cir.   2005)   (same).    In   addition,    as   the\n\nprosecution argued at trial, the jury could have inferred that the\n\nguns were possessed in connection with the April 6th drug offense\n\nfrom the evidence that defendant also possessed a gun during the\n\nFebruary 23rd drug transaction and from the expert testimony that\n\ndrug dealers commonly have guns to protect the drugs they intend to\n\ndistribute.\n\n             Defendant's    sentencing      challenges    fail   as    well.\n\nAlthough, on appeal, he faults the district court's finding that\n\nthe substance involved in the drug offenses was crack, as opposed\n\nto some other form of cocaine base, no such argument was made at\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fsentencing. Accordingly, that finding is reviewable only for plain\n\nerror.     No error, plain or otherwise, occurred.        In making its\n\nfindings, the district court permissibly relied on the presentence\n\nreport, to which defendant posed no relevant objection.             United\n\nStates v. Jimenez, 512 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2007).                 And that\n\nreport's repeated statements that the substance was crack were, in\n\nturn, amply supported by competent testimony at trial that the\n\nsubstance was off-white and chunky and therefore appeared to be\n\ncrack.   See, e.g., United States v. Brown, 450 F.3d 76, 80-81 (1st\n\nCir. 2006).    Moreover, any error was not sufficiently prejudicial\n\nto satisfy the plain error standard, since defendant's guideline\n\nrange resulted not from the nature of the substance involved but\n\nfrom his status as a career offender, which defendant did not\n\nchallenge below or on appeal.       Jimenez, 512 F.3d at 8.\n\n            Nor   was   the    ultimate    sentence    procedurally       or\n\nsubstantively unreasonable under the standards articulated by this\n\ncourt in United States v. Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514 (1st Cir.\n\n2006)(en banc), and, more recently, by the United States Supreme\n\nCourt in Rita v. United States, 127 S. Ct. 2456 (2007), and Gall v.\n\nUnited States, 128 S. Ct. 586 (2007). The district court expressly\n\naddressed--and    adopted,    in   part--defendant's   argument    that    a\n\nbottom-of-guidelines sentence of 35 years was longer than necessary\n\nto serve the purposes of sentencing set forth in 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3553(a).    It was for that reason that the court imposed a sentence\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\ffive years below the guideline range.      The court explained its\n\ndecision not to vary further as based, \"first and foremost,\" on its\n\nbelief that a very long sentence was necessary to protect the\n\npublic, given defendant's violent criminal record, which included\n\na conviction for conspiracy to commit murder, in which defendant\n\nparticipated in beating the victim to death.     Although the court\n\nindicated that its decision was also influenced by the guideline\n\nrange, particularly the career-offender guideline, consideration of\n\nthat range remains    not only permissible but required.   Gall, 128\n\nS. Ct. at 596; Rita, 127 S. Ct. at 2467; Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d\n\nat 518. Since its ultimate sentence was below the guideline range,\n\nthe court obviously did not deem the guidelines in general or the\n\ncareer offender guideline in particular to be mandatory.     To the\n\nextent that defendant quibbles with the weight afforded to the\n\nguidelines as opposed to other factors, such balancing, absent\n\nabuse of its discretion, is for the district court.    Gall, 128 S.\n\nCt. at 597-98; United States v. Dixon, 449 F.3d 194, 205 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).   Seeing no such abuse under the circumstances presented\n\nhere, we affirm the sentence.\n\n          Affirmed.    See 1st Cir. R. 27.0(c)\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f",

The jury could well have found that\n\nevidence to outweigh the evidence pointing the other way--primarily\n\nthat the car was registered to someone else--particularly since\n\ndefendant was known to frequent the address to which the car was\n\nregistered.\n\n               The jury could also have reasonably inferred that the\n\ndrugs found in the car--44.3 grams of cocaine base, packaged in the\n\nform of twelve \"eight balls\"2--were intended for distribution\n\nrather than personal use.         There was expert testimony that such a\n\nlarge       amount,   packaged   in    that   manner,   would   ordinarily   be\n\npossessed by a dealer rather than an end-user.

Although\n\n\"mere presence\" of the guns at the scene of the drug offense is not\n\nsufficient, United States v. Delgado-Hernandez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201780\"><a href=\"/opinion/201780/united-states-v-delgado-hernandez/\"><span class=\"volume\">420</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 25\n\n(1st Cir. 2005), there was more here, albeit circumstantial.                In\n\nparticular, the evidence showed that both guns were loaded and\n\nlocated in close proximity to the defendant and to the drugs and\n\ntherefore could easily have been used to resist any effort, by the\n\npolice or others, to interfere with the intended drug distribution.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Robinson, 473 F.3d at 399-400 (finding\n\nsuch evidence sufficient to show that a gun was possessed \"in\n\nfurtherance of\" another crime);          United States v. Felton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791236\"><a href=\"/opinion/791236/united-states-of-america-appelleecross-appellant-v-leo-v-felton-erica/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,   105,   106   (1st   Cir.   2005)   (same).    In   addition,    as   the\n\nprosecution argued at trial, the jury could have inferred that the\n\nguns were possessed in connection with the April 6th drug offense\n\nfrom the evidence that defendant also possessed a gun during the\n\nFebruary 23rd drug transaction and from the expert testimony that\n\ndrug dealers commonly have guns to protect the drugs they intend to\n\ndistribute.\n\n             Defendant's    sentencing      challenges    fail   as    well.\n\nAlthough, on appeal, he faults the district court's finding that\n\nthe substance involved in the drug offenses was crack, as opposed\n\nto some other form of cocaine base, no such argument was made at\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fsentencing. Accordingly, that finding is reviewable only for plain\n\nerror.     No error, plain or otherwise, occurred.        In making its\n\nfindings, the district court permissibly relied on the presentence\n\nreport, to which defendant posed no relevant objection.             United\n\nStates v. Jimenez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203091\"><a href=\"/opinion/203091/united-states-v-jimenez/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 7 (1st Cir. 2007).                 And that\n\nreport's repeated statements that the substance was crack were, in\n\nturn, amply supported by competent testimony at trial that the\n\nsubstance was off-white and chunky and therefore appeared to be\n\ncrack.   See, e.g., United States v. Brown, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202261\"><a href=\"/opinion/202261/united-states-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">76</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 80-81 (1st\n\nCir. 2006).    Moreover, any error was not sufficiently prejudicial\n\nto satisfy the plain error standard, since defendant's guideline\n\nrange resulted not from the nature of the substance involved but\n\nfrom his status as a career offender, which defendant did not\n\nchallenge below or on appeal.       Jimenez, 512 F.3d at 8.\n\n            Nor   was   the    ultimate    sentence    procedurally       or\n\nsubstantively unreasonable under the standards articulated by this\n\ncourt in United States v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2007). The district court expressly\n\naddressed--and    adopted,    in   part--defendant's   argument    that    a\n\nbottom-of-guidelines sentence of 35 years was longer than necessary\n\nto serve the purposes of sentencing set forth in 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3553(a).    It was for that reason that the court imposed a sentence\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\ffive years below the guideline range.      The court explained its\n\ndecision not to vary further as based, \"first and foremost,\" on its\n\nbelief that a very long sentence was necessary to protect the\n\npublic, given defendant's violent criminal record, which included\n\na conviction for conspiracy to commit murder, in which defendant\n\nparticipated in beating the victim to death.     Although the court\n\nindicated that its decision was also influenced by the guideline\n\nrange, particularly the career-offender guideline, consideration of\n\nthat range remains    not only permissible but required.   Gall, 128\n\nS. Ct. at 596; Rita, 127 S. Ct. at 2467; Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d\n\nat 518. Since its ultimate sentence was below the guideline range,\n\nthe court obviously did not deem the guidelines in general or the\n\ncareer offender guideline in particular to be mandatory.     To the\n\nextent that defendant quibbles with the weight afforded to the\n\nguidelines as opposed to other factors, such balancing, absent\n\nabuse of its discretion, is for the district court.    Gall, 128 S.\n\nCt. at 597-98; United States v.
