Morris on brief for appellant.\n     Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, and Paula D. Silsby,\nUnited States Attorney, on brief for appellee\n\n\n\n                             June 28, 2006\n\f               Per Curiam.     Mitchell McGuire, who was convicted after a\n\njury trial of conspiring to possess and possessing more than five\n\ngrams of crack cocaine with intent to distribute, appeals from his\n\nresentencing under United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005),\n\nafter remand by the Supreme Court and this court for that purpose.1\n\nFor   the     reasons    discussed     below,   we    affirm    the    new,      reduced\n\nsentence.\n\n               Originally, pre-Booker, the district court had imposed a\n\n360-month (30-year) sentence, the bottom of the then-mandatory\n\nguidelines range.         That range resulted primarily from McGuire's\n\nstatus as a career offender under section 4B1.1 of the guidelines.\n\nOn remand, the parties stipulated that McGuire qualifies as a\n\ncareer offender, that the resulting guidelines sentencing range is\n\n360 months to life, and that the sole issue before the district\n\ncourt on remand was \"whether there exists any reason why a lower\n\nsentence should be imposed in light of Booker.\"                  At resentencing,\n\nafter       hearing   arguments   of    counsel      and    engaging   in     extended\n\ncolloquies with McGuire's brother, father, and mother and with\n\nMcGuire       himself,   the   district    court      was    persuaded      to    reduce\n\nMcGuire's sentence by 60 months to 300 months (25 years).                           The\n\n\n\n\n        1\n      The salient facts of the underlying offense are described in\nthis court's opinion affirming McGuire's conviction and his\nsentence, pre-Booker. United States v. McGuire, 389 F.3d 225, 227-\n28 (1st Cir. 2004), vacated, 544 U.S. 946 (2005).\n\n                                         -2-\n\fcourt explained, at length, its reasons for imposing that sentence\n\nin light of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).\n\n             In the present appeal, McGuire argues that the new\n\nsentence is unreasonably high.            Specifically, he contends that the\n\ncareer      offender      guideline,      on    which     the     district   court\n\nsubstantially relied, overstates the seriousness of his criminal\n\nrecord, has a disproportionate impact on African-American males\n\nlike McGuire, and does not reduce recidivism.                 He also argues that\n\nthe disparity in sentencing between crack and powder cocaine\n\noffenses is unwarranted, and that the sentence does not adequately\n\nreflect his post-conviction rehabilitation.\n\n             Of those arguments, only the first and last relate\n\nspecifically to McGuire's individual circumstances.                 The remainder\n\nare policy arguments against the career offender guideline and the\n\ncrack/cocaine differential, which are appropriately addressed to\n\nCongress, not to the courts.            United States v. Caraballo, 447 F.3d\n\n26, 27 (1st Cir. 2006) (career offender guideline); United States\n\nv.   Pho,    433   F.3d    53,    63-65    (1st    Cir.   2006)    (crack/cocaine\n\ndifferential).       Although the length of McGuire's new sentence is\n\nstill driven primarily by the guidelines, that is appropriate\n\nsince, as the district court recognized, despite Booker, the\n\nguidelines     continue      to    be     \"an     important     consideration   in\n\nsentencing.\"       United States v. Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 518\n\n(1st Cir. 2006) (en banc).\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\f          As to McGuire's criminal record, which the district court\n\nreviewed in full detail, we infer that the district court was\n\npersuaded by the government's argument that McGuire's criminal\n\nrecord is \"nothing short of abysmal.\"          Although the court agreed\n\nwith McGuire that his sentence should not be increased based on a\n\nseries of arrests that did not culminate in convictions, the court\n\npermissibly   considered     those   matters   in   determining   McGuire's\n\nattitude, capacity for rehabilitation, and absence of remorse for\n\nhis prior criminal conduct.\n\n          The   court   also   expressly     considered     McGuire's   post-\n\nconviction    change   of   attitude   and   desire   for   rehabilitation.\n\nAlthough the court was skeptical that McGuire had really changed,\n\nit was persuaded by his arguments and those of his counsel and\n\nfamily members that sentencing a 30-year-old man to a 30-year\n\nprison term might \"cause the creation of hopelessness that will\n\nendure for life.\"       For that reason--and demonstrating that the\n\ncourt had considered McGuire's arguments in light of the statutory\n\nfactors, rather than rotely reimposing the original sentence--the\n\ncourt imposed a reduced sentence of 25 years.\n\n          In explaining its reasons for doing so, the court applied\n\nthe relevant statutory factors to the facts of this case.                 In\n\nparticular, the court explained that the sentence was \"sufficient\n\nto provide . . . just punishment for very serious dishonorable\n\ncourse of conduct, not only in distributing drugs which ruins\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\flives, but in acts of violence . . ., inflicting suffering and\n\nmental fear as well as physical abuse upon innocent people.\"                See\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(A).          The court also expressly considered\n\nMcGuire's    family    background     and    prior    record,   18     U.S.C.   §\n\n3553(a)(1); the need for deterrence, both specific and general, 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(B); and the need to protect the public, 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(C). In sum, the court concluded that a 25-year\n\nsentence \"is a most fair, just, honorable sentence in the present\n\ncircumstances of this case.\"        Finding that reasoning plausible and\n\nsupported   by   the   record   and    finding       the   resulting    sentence\n\ndefensible, we defer to the district court's on-the-scene judgment.\n\nJiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d at 519.            Such deference is particularly\n\nappropriate here, given the judge's intimate familiarity with the\n\nunderlying facts, acquired by presiding over McGuire's trial and\n\ntwo sentencing proceedings.\n\n            Accordingly, the sentence is summarily affirmed. See 1st\n\nCir. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f",
