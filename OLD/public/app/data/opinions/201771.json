Gerard O’Neill appeals from a district court\n\njudgment dismissing his age discrimination claim against his former\n\nemployers,    the      New   York   Times      Company   and    the    Boston   Globe\n\nCompany,1 pursuant to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act\n\n(ADEA), 29 U.S.C. §§ 621 et seq., and the Older Workers Benefit\n\nProtection Act (OWBPA), 29 U.S.C. § 626(f)(1).                   We affirm.\n\n                                           I\n\n                                    BACKGROUND\n\n            O’Neill was employed as a journalist by the Boston Globe\n\nfor 35 years, eventually becoming the editor of the investigative-\n\njournalism unit, known as the “Spotlight Team”.                   In January 2000,\n\nwhen O’Neill was 58 years old, Globe Editor Matthew Storin notified\n\nO’Neill    that   he    planned     to    remove   him   from    the    position   of\n\nSpotlight Team editor effective January 1, 2001.                       Storin stated\n\nthat he wanted new ideas on the Team, and suggested that O’Neill\n\nshould    consider     early   retirement       rather    than    transferring     to\n\nanother position at the Globe.                 Eventually, Storin offered the\n\nSpotlight Team editorship to a 54-year-old employee.\n\n            After Globe editors had declined to accept several of\n\nO’Neill’s    proposals       for    new    work    assignments,        he   undertook\n\nnegotiations with the Globe’s human resources department regarding\n\nearly retirement.        In June 2000, the Globe formulated a Voluntary\n\n\n\n     1\n      The New York Times is the parent company of Globe. For ease\nin reference, we shall refer to O’Neill’s employer as “the Globe”.\n\n                                          -2-\n\fEarly Retirement Program (the 2000 VERP), targeting those non-union\n\nemployees who were at least 52 years of age, who had at least\n\ntwenty years of service, and who would not have to be replaced in\n\nthe positions they occupied at the time they opted for early\n\nretirement.     In September 2000, the Globe offered the VERP to\n\nO’Neill, as well as sixteen other employees who purportedly met the\n\neligibility   requirements.   The   Globe   provided   each   of   these\n\nemployees with written notification, as required by the OWBPA,\n\nlisting the job positions, ages, and years of service of the\n\nseventeen eligible employees, as well as of those Globe employees\n\nwith the same job titles who did not meet the VERP eligibility\n\nrequirements.    Additionally, the VERP included a general release\n\nand waiver of the employees’ ADEA rights.    See 29 U.S.C. § 626(f).\n\nThe notification advised employees to consult an attorney before\n\nmaking the “important decision” whether to accept the VERP.        Only\n\nfive of the employees, including O’Neill, opted to take early\n\nretirement under the 2000 VERP.       Nonetheless, O’Neill “saw [the\n\nVERP] as a coerced retirement, because it was the only other option\n\nto doing a take-it-or-leave-it reduced retirement after 35 years of\n\nmeritorious work for the Globe.” O”Neill retired effective January\n\n2001.\n\n          The following year, the Globe once again offered a VERP\n\nto its employees.    When O’Neill learned of the terms of the 2001\n\nVERP, which he considered more lucrative than those in the 2000\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fVERP,   he   was   of   the   mind   “that     somehow   [he]’d   been    treated\n\ndifferently because of [his] age,” and he contacted an attorney.\n\nThe Globe rejected O’Neill’s requests that he be permitted to\n\nparticipate in the 2001 VERP, rather than the 2000 VERP.                 On May 3,\n\n2002, O’Neill’s attorney transmitted a draft complaint to the\n\nGlobe, alleging that its use of the 2000 and 2001 VERPs constituted\n\nillegal age discrimination.          Nevertheless, O’Neill filed no charge\n\nwith the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD)\n\nuntil May 5, 2003.\n\n             In August 2003, O’Neill filed an action for damages\n\nagainst the Globe in state court, alleging that the 2000 VERP had\n\nmaterially omitted or misrepresented facts that the Globe was\n\nobligated to disclose under the OWBPA.               The Globe removed the\n\naction to federal district court. In an amended complaint, O’Neill\n\nalleged, inter alia, that the Globe had violated the ADEA by\n\nincluding    him   as   one   of   the   seventeen   employees     eligible    to\n\nparticipate, and that it had violated the OWBPA by providing\n\ninadequate disclosures in the 2000 VERP documents.\n\n             Following discovery and a hearing, the district court\n\nentered summary judgment for the Globe, based inter alia on two\n\nindependent grounds:          (i) the general release of ADEA rights\n\ncontained in the 2000 VERP was “knowing and voluntary,” hence\n\nenforceable under 29 U.S.C. § 626(f); and (ii) the ADEA claim was\n\ntime-barred in that O’Neill failed to file an administrative\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fcomplaint with the MCAD within 300 days of the alleged injury, as\n\nrequired by 29 U.S.C. § 626(d)(2).\n\n                                            II\n\n                                      DISCUSSION\n\n                  On appeal, O’Neill primarily focuses upon whether the\n\n2000       VERP    provided   sufficient     disclosures      of    information   as\n\nrequired under the OWBPA.              It is unnecessary to address these\n\nissues,       however,     inasmuch    as        the   district    court   correctly\n\ndetermined that the O’Neill ADEA claim is time-barred by the\n\nstatute of limitations in 29 U.S.C. § 626(d)(2).\n\n                  We review the summary judgment ruling de novo, viewing\n\nall evidence and reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most\n\nfavorable to the non-moving party, in order to determine whether\n\nthere exists a trialworthy issue of material fact, and the moving\n\nparty is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.                  See Megwinoff v.\n\nBanco Bilbao Vizcaya, 233 F.3d 73, 74 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n                  The O’Neill ADEA claim unquestionably is time-barred.\n\nSubsection 626(d)(2) requires that an employee file a charge with\n\nthe EEOC within 300 days “after the alleged unlawful practice\n\noccurred.”2         Although O’Neill alleges that the Globe coerced him\n\ninto early retirement in 2000 (e.g., “I accepted the 2000 buyout,\n\n\n\n       2\n      The     claim O’Neill filed in May 2003 with the MCAD would have\nserved as     a simultaneous filing with the EEOC as well. See Davis\nv. Lucent     Techs., Inc., 251 F.3d 227, 230 (1st Cir. 2001) (citing\n29 C.F.R.     § 1601.13(a)(4)).\n\n                                         -5-\n\feven though I saw it as a coerced retirement.”), he failed to\n\nsubmit an MCAD charge until May 2003.            An employee who is presented\n\nwith such a take-it-or-leave-it retirement package is thereupon\n\ndeemed on      notice of the fact of his injury for purposes of\n\ncommencing the limitations period in subsection 626(d)(2).                   See,\n\ne.g., Am. Airlines, Inc. v. Cardoza-Rodriguez, 133 F.3d 111, 122-23\n\n(1st Cir. 1998).\n\n              O’Neill maintains that he did not know until discovery\n\noccurred in the present action that the Globe deliberately withheld\n\npertinent information from the 2000 VERP documents which should\n\nhave been disclosed by the Globe under the OWBPA.             An employee need\n\nnot possess all the pertinent facts of an employer’s alleged\n\ndiscriminatory action in order to commence the running of the\n\nlimitations period.           Rather, it is enough that he “knows that he\n\nhas been hurt and also knows that his employer has inflicted the\n\ninjury.”      Morris v. Gov’t Dev. Bank of P.R., 27 F.3d 746, 750 (1st\n\nCir.   1994);    see    Am.    Airlines,   133   F.3d   at   123   (noting   that\n\nemployees had sufficient information once employer presented them\n\nwith a retirement package on a “take it or leave it” basis, viz.,\n\nretire or lose your job).          Furthermore, when O’Neill learned that\n\nthe    2001   VERP     allegedly    contained    more   lucrative    terms,    he\n\nconcededly thought “that somehow [he]’d been treated differently\n\nbecause of [his] age,” and he contacted an attorney.               Yet he filed\n\nno administrative charge until May 5, 2003, well beyond the time\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fprescribed by subsection 626(d)(2).\n\n           Finally, O’Neill endeavors to evade the clear constraints\n\nprescribed in the limitations provision by invoking the principle\n\nof equitable tolling.    O'Neill contends that, given the fact that\n\nthe Globe deliberately withheld from the VERP documents information\n\nwhich the Globe was required to disclose under the OWBPA, he was\n\nunable to ascertain that crucial, undisclosed information until he\n\nconducted discovery in the course of this lawsuit, and hence could\n\nnot know whether or not he had any viable ADEA claim.         This claim\n\nfails as well.\n\n           Equitable tolling applies only if the employee is aware\n\nof his ADEA rights, yet fails to file a timely administrative\n\ncharge due to reasonable reliance upon the employer’s deceptive\n\nconduct. Such employer deception must exceed any alleged deception\n\nthat is part and parcel of the ADEA claim itself (viz., the Globe’s\n\nalleged failure to disclose in the 2000 VERP the facts which are\n\nrequired by the OWBPA), see American Airlines, 133 F.3d at 124\n\n(noting that plaintiffs “simply parroted the same events that gave\n\nrise to their underlying claim:       that American misled them as to\n\nthe reason for the VERP”), and must have succeeded in “‘lull[ing]\n\nthe plaintiff[] into believing that it was not necessary for [him]\n\nto   commence   litigation,’”   id.   (citation   omitted).    However,\n\nO’Neill, who signed a release of his ADEA rights, has alleged no\n\nsuch deceptive or dilatory practices on the part of the Globe.\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fThus,   the    subsection   626(d)(2)    limitations   period   was   never\n\nequitably tolled.\n\n              For the foregoing reasons, the district court judgment is\n\n              Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\f",

It is unnecessary to address these\n\nissues,       however,     inasmuch    as        the   district    court   correctly\n\ndetermined that the O’Neill ADEA claim is time-barred by the\n\nstatute of limitations in 29 U.S.C. § 626(d)(2).\n\n                  We review the summary judgment ruling de novo, viewing\n\nall evidence and reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most\n\nfavorable to the non-moving party, in order to determine whether\n\nthere exists a trialworthy issue of material fact, and the moving\n\nparty is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

An employee need\n\nnot possess all the pertinent facts of an employer’s alleged\n\ndiscriminatory action in order to commence the running of the\n\nlimitations period.           Rather, it is enough that he “knows that he\n\nhas been hurt and also knows that his employer has inflicted the\n\ninjury.”      Morris v. Gov’t Dev.

Furthermore, when O’Neill learned that\n\nthe    2001   VERP     allegedly    contained    more   lucrative    terms,    he\n\nconcededly thought “that somehow [he]’d been treated differently\n\nbecause of [his] age,” and he contacted an attorney.               Yet he filed\n\nno administrative charge until May 5, 2003, well beyond the time\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fprescribed by subsection 626(d)(2).\n\n           Finally, O’Neill endeavors to evade the clear constraints\n\nprescribed in the limitations provision by invoking the principle\n\nof equitable tolling.    O'Neill contends that, given the fact that\n\nthe Globe deliberately withheld from the VERP documents information\n\nwhich the Globe was required to disclose under the OWBPA, he was\n\nunable to ascertain that crucial, undisclosed information until he\n\nconducted discovery in the course of this lawsuit, and hence could\n\nnot know whether or not he had any viable ADEA claim.         This claim\n\nfails as well.\n\n           Equitable tolling applies only if the employee is aware\n\nof his ADEA rights, yet fails to file a timely administrative\n\ncharge due to reasonable reliance upon the employer’s deceptive\n\nconduct. Such employer deception must exceed any alleged deception\n\nthat is part and parcel of the ADEA claim itself (viz., the Globe’s\n\nalleged failure to disclose in the 2000 VERP the facts which are\n\nrequired by the OWBPA), see American Airlines, 133 F.3d at 124\n\n(noting that plaintiffs “simply parroted the same events that gave\n\nrise to their underlying claim:       that American misled them as to\n\nthe reason for the VERP”), and must have succeeded in “‘lull[ing]\n\nthe plaintiff[] into believing that it was not necessary for [him]\n\nto   commence   litigation,’”   id.   (citation   omitted).    However,\n\nO’Neill, who signed a release of his ADEA rights, has alleged no\n\nsuch deceptive or dilatory practices on the part of the Globe.\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fThus,   the    subsection   626(d)(2)    limitations   period   was   never\n\nequitably tolled.\n\n              For the foregoing reasons, the district court judgment is\n\n              Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\f</pre>",
