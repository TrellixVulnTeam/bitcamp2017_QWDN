In    this       case   we   interpret\n\nMassachusetts General Laws chapter 183A, section 5, which governs\n\ncondominium    owners'   rights   and    powers    vis-à-vis        the    phased\n\ndevelopment of condominium projects.             We reverse the district\n\ncourt, In re Northwood Props., LLC, 356 B.R. 81 (D. Mass. 2006),\n\nbecause its statutory interpretation was in error.\n\n          Northwood Properties, LLC, (\"Northwood\") is the developer\n\nof Northwood at Sudbury, a partially completed condominium project.\n\nNorthwood is currently attempting to reorganize under Chapter 11 of\n\nthe Bankruptcy Code.     At every turn, its reorganization has been\n\nopposed by three individuals: Sidney Bourne, Claudio Delise, and\n\nRalph Tyler.     Bourne and Delise are residents of Northwood at\n\nSudbury; all three are creditors of Northwood.               Bourne and Delise\n\nvigorously oppose Northwood's attempt to extend its rights to\n\nfinish developing Northwood at Sudbury, rights which were set by\n\nthe original master deed to expire in 2005.            Without the extension\n\nof these rights, Northwood's efforts at reorganization will likely\n\nfail.\n\n          This   discrete    dispute     turns    on    a    provision    in   the\n\nMassachusetts condominium statute which provides that a condominium\n\nowner constructively consents to the addition of further units \"if\n\nthe master deed at the time of the recording of the unit deed . . .\n\nmade possible an accurate determination of the alteration of each\n\nunit's undivided interest that would result therefrom.\" Mass. Gen.\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fLaws ch. 183A, § 5(b)(1).           This provision has yet to be interpreted\n\nby the Supreme Judicial Court or the Massachusetts Appeals Court.\n\n            Further, Bourne, Delise, and Tyler all oppose Northwood's\n\nreorganization plan, offering their own in its place.                 Under their\n\nplan, they would take control of the reorganized development\n\ncompany, Bourne and Delise would be paid for their consent to\n\nfurther development, and Tyler would receive a large settlement for\n\nhis long-running litigation against Northwood at Sudbury.                          The\n\nthree appellees also argue that Northwood's final plan denied them\n\na vote in its confirmation by leaving their rights as creditors\n\nunimpaired.\n\n            The bankruptcy court held that Northwood had successfully\n\nextended its development rights; rejected Bourne, Delise, and\n\nTyler's voting complaint; and confirmed Northwood's plan.                          The\n\ndistrict    court,      sitting     as    an    intermediate   appellate        court,\n\ninterpreted section 5 of chapter 183A to hold that Northwood had\n\nnot successfully extended its development rights.                  In re Northwood\n\nProps.,    356   B.R.    at   89.        Because   it   remanded    the    issue    of\n\nconfirmation of Northwood's plan for reconsideration in light of\n\nthis ruling, it did not consider the voting argument.                     Id.\n\n            We hold that we have jurisdiction over both disputes,\n\nhold that the district court's interpretation of the condominium\n\nstatute was in error, reverse the district court's ruling on the\n\nvalidity of Northwood's development rights, find the district\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fcourt's    remand   moot   on   the   grounds    stated,    and   affirm   the\n\nbankruptcy court's confirmation of the reorganization plan.\n\n                                      I.\n\n            Northwood at Sudbury was originally envisioned as a six-\n\nbuilding complex that would offer residential care to the residents\n\nof its sixty-six condominium units.              The master deed for the\n\ncondominium   was   recorded    on    December   9,   1998,   following    the\n\ncompletion of the first phase of development, which consisted of\n\none twelve-unit building.       As the Massachusetts Appeals Court has\n\nexplained, \"[i]n a phased condominium development, groups or stages\n\nof units are completed over a period of several years and become\n\npart of the condominium by successive amendments to the master\n\ndeed.   'Phasing' is not a statutory term, but is a usage that has\n\ngrown out of the general enabling provisions\" of the condominium\n\nstatute.    Podell v. Lahn, 651 N.E.2d 859, 860 n.3 (Mass. App. Ct.\n\n1995). The deed allowed for four additional phases of construction\n\nto complete the project, but it set those development rights to\n\nexpire on December 9, 2005.\n\n            The master deed was amended on May 20, 2002, to account\n\nfor the completion of the second phase, which consisted of another\n\ntwelve-unit building and a clubhouse.             Bourne and Delise each\n\npurchased a unit built in this second phase.               No further phases\n\nhave yet been undertaken.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f             In advance of the expiration of its development rights,\n\nNorthwood        negotiated    an    extension    of   those   rights     with    the\n\ncondominium unit owners' association (\"Association\") in exchange\n\nfor $700,000.        Even though Northwood had filed for bankruptcy in\n\nthe   interim,      twenty    unit    owners     approved   the   extension,     two\n\nabstained, and two -- Bourne and Delise -- voted against it.                     This\n\neighty-three percent approval was more than sufficient under the\n\nmaster deed to extend the development rights until December 9,\n\n2010.\n\n             When Northwood filed for bankruptcy in September 2005,\n\nthere were five unsecured claims held by non-insider creditors: (1)\n\n$50.00 owed to NStar; (2) $50.00 owed to KeySpan; (3) $305.92 owed\n\nto GZA GeoEnvironmental; (4) $622,270 allegedly owed to Ralph\n\nTyler; and (5) approximately $1.5 million owed to the Association.\n\nNorthwood disputed the debt claimed by Tyler; the legitimacy of\n\nthat claim is still pending before the bankruptcy court.1\n\n             Bourne and Delise filed a Phasing Rights Motion in\n\nNorthwood's bankruptcy proceedings in February 2006, seeking a\n\ndetermination that the extension of development rights was not\n\nvalid without their consent.            In March 2006, Bourne, Delise, and\n\nTyler     each    purchased,    respectively,       the   NStar   debt,    the   GZA\n\nGeoEnvironmental debt, and the KeySpan debt. By becoming creditors\n\n\n      1\n          The alleged debt is related to ongoing legal battles over\nzoning and permitting stretching back to the initiation of the\nNorthwood at Sudbury development in 1998.\n\n                                         -5-\n\fof Northwood, they improved their ability to oppose Northwood's\n\nChapter 11 reorganization plan and gained the opportunity to submit\n\ntheir own.\n\n            Northwood filed its first proposed reorganization plan in\n\nMay 2006.    Under this plan, the five unsecured, non-insider claims\n\nwere grouped together and would initially receive approximately\n\nfive percent of the allowed amount of those claims.              Proceeds from\n\neither    future    condominium   sales     or   the    sale   of   Northwood's\n\ndevelopment rights would then be distributed pro rata among the\n\nclaims.      As    relevant   here,    a    claim      is   impaired   under   a\n\nreorganization plan if the plan does not \"leave[] unaltered the\n\nlegal, equitable, and contractual rights to which such claim . . .\n\nentitles the holder of such claim.\"         11 U.S.C. § 1124(1).        Because\n\ntheir interests were impaired under this plan, Bourne, Delise, and\n\nTyler had a controlling vote over the plan's confirmation, which\n\nthey opposed.\n\n            Northwood then submitted a revised version of its plan in\n\nJuly 2006.        This version grouped the NStar, KeySpan, and GZA\n\nGeoEnvironmental debts into a convenience class; these claims,\n\nincluding interest, would be paid in full immediately.                  Tyler's\n\noriginal claim was placed in its own class and would be paid in\n\nfull with interest once a final, non-appealable order allowing the\n\nclaim was entered.      This left the Association's claim in its own\n\nclass, to be paid over time by Northwood's future earnings as under\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fthe first proposed plan.     Because the interests of Bourne, Delise,\n\nand Tyler were no longer impaired under this plan, their votes were\n\nnot required for the plan's confirmation.       The Association, whose\n\ninterests remained impaired, voted to accept the plan.\n\n           In July 2006, the bankruptcy court denied Bourne and\n\nDelise's Phasing Rights Motion, rejecting their argument that,\n\ndespite the vote of the Association, no development rights could be\n\nextended without their specific consent.       The court then conducted\n\na confirmation hearing on Northwood's revised plan and approved it.\n\nBourne, Delise, and Tyler objected to the reclassification of\n\nclaims under the revised plan, arguing that it impermissibly\n\nnullified their votes.     The court rejected this argument, however,\n\nbecause   the    revised   plan   fulfilled   all   their   interests   as\n\ncreditors.      Bourne, Delise, and Tyler moved for reconsideration,\n\nprimarily of the phasing rights issue; the court denied the motion.\n\nThey then appealed to the district court, which took a different\n\nview of the matter than did the bankruptcy court.\n\n           Before the district court, Bourne, Delise, and Tyler\n\nargued that their Phasing Rights Motion should have been granted\n\nand that the revised plan should not have been confirmed.         On the\n\nconfirmation question, they argued in part that the plan was\n\ninfeasible if Northwood did not have legitimate development rights\n\nand in part that Northwood's reclassification of their claims was\n\n\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fan impermissible \"gerrymander\" meant to deprive them of a say in\n\nNorthwood's reorganization.\n\n          The district court held a hearing on November 16, 2006,\n\nwhich focused on the appellees' Phasing Rights Motion.           The court\n\nissued its order three weeks later, essentially granting the\n\nPhasing Rights Motion and holding that Northwood's development\n\nrights had not been legitimately extended. In re Northwood Props.,\n\n356 B.R. at 89.    It vacated the confirmation of the plan on the\n\ngrounds that the plan was not feasible without the development\n\nrights.   Id.      In   so   concluding,    the   court   interpreted   the\n\ncondominium statute as demanding a great degree of precision. That\n\nis the first merits issue before us.\n\n          Because the court found the revised plan not feasible and\n\nthus vacated the plan's confirmation on that ground, the court did\n\nnot address the reclassification argument. Id. That is the second\n\nissue before us.\n\n          The   district     court   suggested    that    Northwood   could\n\nsuccessfully extend its development rights with less than unanimous\n\nconsent of the unit owners if the Association first agreed that the\n\npercentage interests of the opposed unit owners (Bourne and Delise)\n\nin the condominium's common areas would remain unchanged. This, of\n\ncourse, would necessitate a greater decrease in the percentage\n\ninterests of the remaining owners.         Id. at 88.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\f           Upon Northwood's motion, the district court modified its\n\norder, remanding the plan confirmation to the bankruptcy court so\n\nthat Northwood could pursue this suggestion for curing the problem\n\nfound by the district court.     Northwood has appealed to this court\n\nboth the district court's ruling on the Phasing Rights Motion and\n\nits remand of the plan confirmation to the bankruptcy court.\n\n                                   II.\n\nA.         Standard of Review\n\n           In an appeal from district court review of a bankruptcy\n\ncourt order, this court independently examines the bankruptcy\n\ncourt's decision, reviewing findings of fact for clear error and\n\nconclusions of law de novo.     Official, Unsecured Creditors' Comm.\n\nv. Stern (In re SPM Mfg. Corp.), 984 F.2d 1305, 1310-11 (1st Cir.\n\n1993).   The district court decision is given no deference.       Id. at\n\n1311.\n\nB.         Phasing Rights Motion\n\n           1.       Appellate Jurisdiction\n\n           Appeals in bankruptcy proceedings are governed primarily\n\nby 28 U.S.C. § 158, although in Connecticut National Bank v.\n\nGermain, 503 U.S. 249 (1992), the Supreme Court clarified that\n\njurisdiction under § 158 was in addition to, not in lieu of, the\n\nnormal appellate jurisdiction provided by 28 U.S.C. §§ 1291-1292.\n\nId. at 253.        Sitting as an intermediate appellate court, the\n\ndistrict   court    exercised   jurisdiction   under   §   158(a)(1)   in\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\freviewing    the    \"final     judgments,       orders,    and    decrees\"      of   the\n\nbankruptcy court.         Both of the bankruptcy court's decisions --\n\ndenying the Phasing Rights Motion and confirming the revised plan\n\n-- were final as required by § 158(a)(1).\n\n            The circuit courts have further appellate jurisdiction\n\nover \"all final decisions, judgments, orders, and decrees\" issued\n\nby   the   district     court    sitting    in      its   appellate      capacity      in\n\nbankruptcy proceedings.          28 U.S.C. § 158(d)(1); see also 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1291.    This limitation on our appellate jurisdiction recognizes\n\nthat \"the 'finality' of a bankruptcy court's decision may be\n\naffected by the district court's disposition of the appeal.\"\n\nBowers v. Conn. Nat'l Bank, 847 F.2d 1019, 1022 (2d Cir. 1988).\n\nRequiring the bankruptcy court's decision to be truly final, which\n\nrequires the district court's appellate review to be final, avoids\n\npiecemeal appellate review before this court, thereby conserving\n\njudicial resources.        In re St. Charles Pres. Investors, Ltd., 916\n\nF.2d 727, 729 (D.C. Cir. 1990). However, \"because bankruptcy cases\n\ntypically involve numerous controversies bearing only a slight\n\nrelationship       to   each    other,   'finality'       is     given    a   flexible\n\ninterpretation in bankruptcy.\"            In re G.S.F. Corp., 938 F.2d 1467,\n\n1473 (1st Cir. 1991), abrogated on different grounds by Conn. Nat'l\n\nBank, 503 U.S. 249.\n\n            The district court's ruling on the Phasing Rights Motion\n\nis   a   final   determination      under       §   158(d).      \"To     be   final,    a\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\fbankruptcy    order    need   not    resolve    all   of   the    issues      in   the\n\nproceeding,    but    it   must     finally    dispose     of    all    the   issues\n\npertaining to a discrete dispute within the larger proceeding.\"\n\nPerry v. First Citizens Fed. Credit Union (In re Perry), 391 F.3d\n\n282, 285 (1st Cir. 2004); see also In re G.S.F. Corp., 938 F.2d at\n\n1473; In re Saco Local Dev. Corp., 711 F.2d 441, 444 (1st Cir.\n\n1983).   The Phasing Rights Motion is essentially a declaratory\n\naction, seeking a judicial determination as to whether Northwood's\n\ndevelopment rights have been legitimately extended.                    Although the\n\nmotion does not finally resolve all disputes between Northwood and\n\nBourne and Delise, it does resolve a discrete dispute that was\n\ninstigated before Bourne and Delise became creditors of Northwood.\n\nThat is, it definitively resolves Bourne and Delise's rights as\n\ncondominium owners, even if not their rights as creditors.2                         We\n\nhave jurisdiction over this question under § 158(d).\n\n          2.          The Condominium Statute\n\n\n\n\n     2\n          Although the district court remanded the bankruptcy\ncourt's ruling on the Phasing Rights Motion, that remand pertained\nto a purely ministerial task, the entry of an order granting the\nmotion. This does not affect the finality of the district court's\ndetermination. See In re Gould & Eberhardt Gear Mach. Corp., 852\nF.2d 26, 29 (1st Cir. 1988) (\"When a remand leaves only ministerial\nproceedings, . . . then the remand may be considered final [in\nterms of § 158(d)].\"); see also, e.g., Aegis Specialty Mktg. Inc.\nv. Ferlita (In re Aegis Specialty Mktg. Inc. of Ala.), 68 F.3d 919,\n921 (5th Cir. 1995) (considering \"the entry of an order by the\nbankruptcy court in accordance with the district court's decision\"\nto be only a ministerial proceeding such that the district court's\nremand was a final order).\n\n                                      -11-\n\f            Condominiums are governed in Massachusetts by chapter\n\n183A   of   the   Massachusetts         General   Laws.      Chapter      183A   \"is\n\nessentially an enabling statute, setting out a framework for the\n\ndevelopment of condominiums in the Commonwealth, while providing\n\ndevelopers    and      unit    owners   with   planning    flexibility.          Such\n\nflexibility    is    particularly       important   with    respect      to    phased\n\ncondominium    developments        where    long-term     financial      and   market\n\nconditions may be uncertain.\" Queler v. Skowron, 780 N.E.2d 71, 77\n\n(Mass. 2002) (citation omitted); see also Tosney v. Chelmsford\n\nVill. Condo. Ass'n, 493 N.E.2d 488, 490 (Mass. 1986); Barclay v.\n\nDeVeau, 429 N.E.2d 323, 326 (Mass. 1981).\n\n            Phasing allows developers to sell units as they are\n\nbuilt,   which    in    turn    eases    construction     costs    and    financing\n\narrangements.       The flexibility to revise plans as market and\n\nfinancing    conditions        change   also   greatly     assists    condominium\n\ndevelopment.        The state legislature significantly revised the\n\ncondominium statute in 1998, adding the key provision in question\n\nhere and increasing the powers of unit owners' associations vis-à-\n\nvis individual unit owners.                It did so in recognition of \"a\n\nshortage of affordable housing stock based upon the expiration of\n\nthe right to add additional condominium units and land in numerous\n\ncondominiums created pursuant to chapter 183A.\"                   1998 Mass. Adv.\n\nLegis. Serv. 242 (LexisNexis).\n\n\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\f            We turn to section 5 of chapter 183A with these policy\n\nconcerns in mind.       Because neither the Supreme Judicial Court nor\n\nthe   Massachusetts      Appeals         Court     has     interpreted      the    relevant\n\nprovisions of section 5 since it was last amended in 1998, we\n\naddress     the    question         ab     initio.         As   with     all      statutory\n\ninterpretation questions, we focus on the language of the statute\n\nitself.\n\n            Section 5(b)(2) describes the authority and powers of a\n\ncondominium's unit owners' association, which includes the power to\n\n\"[e]xtend, revive or grant rights to develop the condominium,\n\nincluding    the    right      to    add    additional       units     or   land    to   the\n\ncondominium.\"      Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 183A, § 5(b)(2)(iii).                      It is not\n\ndisputable       that   the     Association's            extension     of      Northwood's\n\ndevelopment rights met the requirements of section 5(b)(2)(iii).\n\nAs    required     by   that    provision,           the    master     deed    authorized\n\nadditional units, and the eighty-three percent approval rate by the\n\nAssociation's members of the extension surpassed the seventy-five\n\npercent set by the statute as a default percentage.                         See id.\n\n            The extension of the time to exercise development rights,\n\nhowever, is distinct from the ability to exercise those rights\n\nunder the statute.        The addition of units reduces the percentage\n\ninterest each unit owner holds in the condominium's common areas.\n\nState law provides some protection for unit owners in this context.\n\nUnder section 5(b)(1), a unit owner's percentage interest in the\n\n\n                                            -13-\n\fcommon areas cannot be \"materially affected\" without his or her\n\nconsent.\n\n            Northwood      broadly    argues      that    section   5(b)(2)(iii)\n\noperates independently from section 5(b)(1) and that unit owners\n\nhave necessarily waived their rights under section 5(b)(1) through\n\ntheir acceptance of any master deed.              We disagree in light of the\n\nlanguage in section 5(b) that \"[i]n the event of any conflict\n\nbetween the provisions of this subsection and of the master deed,\n\n. . . this subsection shall control.\"\n\n            Nonetheless, state law also provides that the requisite\n\nconsent can be inferred from the unit owner's acceptance of the\n\nmaster deed if, at the time the unit deed was recorded, the master\n\ndeed (1) provided for the additional units and (2) \"made possible\n\nan   accurate   determination        of   the   alteration     of   each    unit's\n\n[percentage] interest that would result\" from the construction of\n\nthe additional units.        Id. § 5(b)(1).       The master deed in this case\n\nclearly provided for additional units. The ability of Northwood to\n\nexercise its development rights thus hinges on the interpretation\n\nof   this   second    clause,     particularly      the   phrase    \"an    accurate\n\ndetermination    of    the      alteration   of    each    unit's   [percentage]\n\ninterest.\"\n\n            The district court interpreted this phrase too narrowly.\n\nOn its reading, an \"accurate determination\" is the same as \"precise\n\ncalculations.\"        In   re    Northwood   Properties,      356   B.R.    at   87.\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fBecause the master deed did not make it possible for Bourne and\n\nDelise \"to calculate precisely what their new percentage interests\n\nwould be following the completion of any additional phases,\" the\n\ncourt concluded, Northwood must obtain their express consent before\n\nconstructing any further units.   Id. at 89 (emphasis added).\n\n           To impose a requirement of precise calculations of what\n\nthe new percentage interests would be upon development, however,\n\nruns counter to the statute's underlying policies of flexibility\n\nand pragmatism as well as the language of related provisions.     It\n\nis also inconsistent with the approach taken by the state courts in\n\ninterpreting this statute.\n\n           As a matter of statutory construction, section 5(a) is\n\nclosely related to the provision in dispute here, and that section\n\nstates that a unit owner's percentage interest \"shall be in the\n\napproximate relation that the fair value of the unit . . . bears to\n\nthe . . . aggregate fair value of all the units\" at the time the\n\nunit deed is recorded.   Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 183A, § 5(a).      Terms\n\nlike \"approximate\" and \"fair value\" reflect a statutory approach of\n\nallowing developers flexibility within a reasonably limited range,\n\nnot an approach requiring absolute precision. We see no reason why\n\ngreater requirements for precision would be imposed under section\n\n5(b)(1).\n\n           Further, in practice, the district court's reading would\n\ntie the hands of developers, making it impossible for them to\n\n\n                               -15-\n\frespond to changing market conditions.             This would seriously\n\njeopardize developers' ability to secure financing to complete\n\nprojects.    This in turn could have an adverse impact on present\n\nowners of units. And it implicates the legislature's concern about\n\nremoving    impediments     to    developing   more    housing    in     the\n\nCommonwealth.      Thus we read the key phrase, \"made possible an\n\naccurate determination,\" as not requiring the degree of precision\n\nthe district court posited.\n\n            Our reading is more consistent than that of the district\n\ncourt with the approach taken by state courts in interpreting\n\nChapter 183A.      That statute as a whole is an enabling statute.\n\nTosney, 493 N.E.2d at 490.       It sets forth minimum requirements but\n\nalso provides for flexibility.        Included in that flexibility, and\n\nmeant for the benefit of both unit owners and developers, is the\n\nability to adapt the size and scope of a project in response to\n\nmarket conditions by phasing the development over some years.            See\n\nQueler, 780 N.E.2d at 77; Podell, 651 N.E.2d at 860 n.3.\n\n            We need not determine here the bare minimum a master deed\n\nneed include to satisfy the constructive consent provision of\n\nsection 5(b)(1).      And it is better for the state courts to\n\nthemselves articulate the correct standard to apply.          What was in\n\nthe master deed in this case, in our view, was enough.\n\n            The master deed stated how the percentage interests would\n\nbe   calculated.     It   explained   that   the   original   schedule   of\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\fpercentage interests had been calculated \"in conformance with\n\nChapter 183A, upon the approximate relation which the fair market\n\nvalue of each Unit . . . bears to the aggregate fair market value\n\nof all the Units\"; that is, the deed treats \"conformance with\n\nChapter 183A\" as equivalent to the standard set by section 5(a).\n\nIn the same paragraph, the master deed states that \"such percentage\n\ninterests [shall be] modified in conformance with Chapter 183A\"\n\nfollowing the construction of additional phases.          Thus Bourne and\n\nDelise knew that their percentage interest would continue to track\n\nthe approximate ratio of the value of their units to the value of\n\nall the units.\n\n           The master deed also provided enough information about\n\nfuture phases to allow a reasoned and reasonable approximation of\n\nwhat the aggregate fair value might be.          There would be at most\n\nsixty-six units, the construction of which would be of equal\n\nquality to the existing units.      The blueprint of the proposed full\n\ndevelopment,   included   with   the   master    deed,   showed    that    two\n\nadditional buildings would have the same footprint as the two\n\nexisting   buildings   and   that   the    remaining   building    would    be\n\nslightly larger; this implies that the future units would not be\n\ngrossly disproportional in size to the existing units.            The master\n\ndeed, by definition, cannot precisely predict the future at the\n\ntime of its execution.       It can, however, set forth reliable and\n\n\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\faccepted methodologies and provide an accurate description of\n\nplanned development.\n\n           This amount of information is sufficient to allow both\n\nthe Association and Bourne and Delise to accurately determine how\n\ntheir percentage interests would be affected. They were not caught\n\nby surprise or unfairly treated.        Bourne and Delise argue that the\n\nfact that Northwood and the Association offered two different\n\npredictions of their future percentage interests in itself proves\n\nthat no \"accurate determination\" was possible, but the very small\n\nrange between Northwood's prediction of 1.52% and the Association's\n\nprediction of 1.43% -- a 0.09% difference -- does not mean that no\n\n\"accurate\" determination was possible.\n\n           The master deed \"made possible an accurate determination\n\nof the alteration of each unit's [percentage] interest that would\n\nresult\" from the completion of further phases. As such, Bourne and\n\nDelise consented to the future alteration of their percentage\n\ninterests when they recorded their unit deeds.          Northwood may thus\n\nexercise   the   development   rights    legitimately    extended   by   the\n\nAssociation under section 5(b)(2)(iii).\n\nC.         Confirmation of the Reorganization Plan\n\n           We have jurisdiction, in these circumstances, to reach\n\nthe issue of the confirmation of Northwood's plan.           The district\n\ncourt did not consider two other objections made by Bourne, Delise,\n\nand Tyler to that confirmation.     As our review of these issues is\n\n\n                                  -18-\n\fde novo and on the record from the bankruptcy court, we can and do\n\nresolve them ourselves.      See Advanced Testing Techs., Inc. v.\n\nDesmond (In re Computer Eng'g Assocs., Inc.), 337 F.3d 38, 45 (1st\n\nCir. 2003) (\"Our review of the district court's decision amounts to\n\nreview of the bankruptcy court's decision in the first instance.\");\n\nIn re SPM Mfg. Corp., 984 F.2d at 1310-11 (\"In an appeal from\n\ndistrict court review of a bankruptcy court order, the court of\n\nappeals independently reviews the bankruptcy court's decision . .\n\n. .\") (emphasis added).   Given the lengthy history of this dispute\n\nand the need to avoid piecemeal litigation, we decline to remand to\n\nthe district court, with the attendant expense and delay, to\n\naddress issues fully briefed before us that we can resolve.              We\n\nturn to the two other objections.\n\n          We reject the claim that there has been a violation of\n\nthe Statute of Frauds.    No separate written document was needed as\n\nthis dispute concerns no sale of real property.           See Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws ch. 259, § 1 (\"[n]o action shall be brought . . . [u]pon a\n\ncontract for the sale of lands, tenements . . . or of any interest\n\nin or concerning them\" unless the contract is in writing and signed\n\nby the party to be charged).\n\n          The   appellees'   second     objection   is   that   they   were\n\nerroneously grouped into an artificial convenience class in the\n\nrevised plan in order to orchestrate acceptance of the plan.            The\n\nbankruptcy court found that \"the reclassification improves the\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\ffinancial position of Bourne, Delise, and Tyler by providing for\n\nfull payment of their claims and, hence, does not adversely affect\n\nthem.\"   There was no error, much less clear error, in this finding.\n\nOnce their interests as creditors are fully protected, Bourne,\n\nDelise, and Tyler have no legitimate grounds for objecting to the\n\nreorganization plan.\n\n                                III.\n\n           We reverse the decision of the district court, affirm\n\nthe bankruptcy court's confirmation of the reorganization plan,\n\nand remand the case to that court for any further proceedings\n\nconsistent with this opinion.    Costs are awarded to Northwood.\n\n\n\n\n                                -20-\n\f",

Delise, and Ralph S. Tyler, on brief, pro se.</p>\n<p>Before TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge, CAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judge, and LYNCH, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>LYNCH, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>In this case we interpret Massachusetts General Laws chapter 183A, section 5, which governs condominium owners' rights and powers vis-à-vis the phased development of condominium projects. We reverse the district court, <i>In re Northwood Props., LLC,</i> 356 B.R. 81 (D.Mass.2006), because its statutory interpretation was in error.</p>\n<p>Northwood Properties, LLC, (\"Northwood\") is the developer of Northwood at Sudbury, a partially completed condominium project. Northwood is currently attempting to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. At every turn, its reorganization has been opposed by three individuals: Sidney Bourne, Claudio Delise, and Ralph Tyler. Bourne and Delise are residents of Northwood at Sudbury; all three are creditors of Northwood. Bourne and Delise vigorously oppose Northwood's attempt to extend its rights to finish developing Northwood at Sudbury, rights which were set by the original master deed to expire in 2005. Without the extension of these rights, Northwood's efforts at reorganization will likely fail.</p>\n<p>This discrete dispute turns on a provision in the Massachusetts condominium statute which provides that a condominium owner constructively consents to the addition of further units \"if the master deed at the time of the recording of the unit deed . . . made possible an accurate determination of the alteration of each unit's undivided interest that would result therefrom.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 183A, § 5(b)(1). This provision has yet to be interpreted by the Supreme Judicial Court or the Massachusetts Appeals Court.</p>\n<p>Further, Bourne, Delise, and Tyler all oppose Northwood's reorganization plan, offering their own in its place. Under their plan, they would take control of the reorganized development company, Bourne and Delise would be paid for their consent to further development, and Tyler would receive a large settlement for his long-running litigation against Northwood at Sudbury. The three appellees also argue that Northwood's final plan denied them a vote in its confirmation by leaving their rights as creditors unimpaired.</p>\n<p>The bankruptcy court held that Northwood had successfully extended its development rights; rejected Bourne, Delise, and Tyler's voting complaint; and confirmed Northwood's plan. The district court, sitting as an intermediate appellate court, interpreted section 5 of chapter 183A to hold that Northwood had <i>not</i> successfully extended its development rights. <i>In re Northwood Props.,</i> 356 B.R. at 89. Because it remanded the issue of confirmation of Northwood's plan for reconsideration in light of this ruling, it did not consider the voting argument. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>We hold that we have jurisdiction over both disputes, hold that the district court's interpretation of the condominium statute was in error, reverse the district court's ruling on the validity of Northwood's development rights, find the district court's remand moot on the grounds stated, and affirm the bankruptcy court's confirmation of the reorganization plan.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Northwood at Sudbury was originally envisioned as a six-building complex <span class=\"star-pagination\">*19</span> that would offer residential care to the residents of its sixty-six condominium units. The master deed for the condominium was recorded on December 9, 1998, following the completion of the first phase of development, which consisted of one twelve-unit building. As the Massachusetts Appeals Court has explained, \"[i]n a phased condominium development, groups or stages of units are completed over a period of several years and become part of the condominium by successive amendments to the master deed. `Phasing' is not a statutory term, but is a usage that has grown out of the general enabling provisions\" of the condominium statute. <i>Podell v. Lahn,</i> 38 Mass.App.Ct. 688, 651 N.E.2d 859, 860 n. 3 (1995). The deed allowed for four additional phases of construction to complete the project, but it set those development rights to expire on December 9, 2005.</p>\n<p>The master deed was amended on May 20, 2002, to account for the completion of the second phase, which consisted of another twelve-unit building and a clubhouse. Bourne and Delise each purchased a unit built in this second phase. No further phases have yet been undertaken.</p>\n<p>In advance of the expiration of its development rights, Northwood negotiated an extension of those rights with the condominium unit owners' association (\"Association\") in exchange for $700,000. Even though Northwood had filed for bankruptcy in the interim, twenty unit owners approved the extension, two abstained, and two  Bourne and Delise  voted against it. This eighty-three percent approval was more than sufficient under the master deed to extend the development rights until December 9, 2010.</p>\n<p>When Northwood filed for bankruptcy in September 2005, there were five unsecured claims held by non-insider creditors: (1) $50.00 owed to NStar; (2) $50.00 owed to KeySpan; (3) $305.92 owed to GZA GeoEnvironmental; (4) $622,270 allegedly owed to Ralph Tyler; and (5) approximately $1.5 million owed to the Association. Northwood disputed the debt claimed by Tyler; the legitimacy of that claim is still pending before the bankruptcy court.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Bourne and Delise filed a Phasing Rights Motion in Northwood's bankruptcy proceedings in February 2006, seeking a determination that the extension of development rights was not valid without their consent. In March 2006, Bourne, Delise, and Tyler each purchased, respectively, the NStar debt, the GZA GeoEnvironmental debt, and the KeySpan debt. By becoming creditors of Northwood, they improved their ability to oppose Northwood's Chapter 11 reorganization plan and gained the opportunity to submit their own.</p>\n<p>Northwood filed its first proposed reorganization plan in May 2006. Under this plan, the five unsecured, non-insider claims were grouped together and would initially receive approximately five percent of the allowed amount of those claims. Proceeds from either future condominium sales or the sale of Northwood's development rights would then be distributed pro rata among the claims. As relevant here, a claim is impaired under a reorganization plan if the plan does not \"leave[ ] unaltered the legal, equitable, and contractual rights to which such claim . . . entitles the holder of such claim.\" 11 U.S.C. § 1124(1). Because their interests were impaired under this plan, Bourne, Delise, and Tyler had a controlling vote over the plan's confirmation, which they opposed.</p>\n<p>Northwood then submitted a revised version of its plan in July 2006. This <span class=\"star-pagination\">*20</span> version grouped the NStar, KeySpan, and GZA GeoEnvironmental debts into a convenience class; these claims, including interest, would be paid in full immediately. Tyler's original claim was placed in its own class and would be paid in full with interest once a final, non-appealable order allowing the claim was entered. This left the Association's claim in its own class, to be paid over time by Northwood's future earnings as under the first proposed plan. Because the interests of Bourne, Delise, and Tyler were no longer impaired under this plan, their votes were not required for the plan's confirmation. The Association, whose interests remained impaired, voted to accept the plan.</p>\n<p>In July 2006, the bankruptcy court denied Bourne and Delise's Phasing Rights Motion, rejecting their argument that, despite the vote of the Association, no development rights could be extended without their specific consent. The court then conducted a confirmation hearing on Northwood's revised plan and approved it. Bourne, Delise, and Tyler objected to the reclassification of claims under the revised plan, arguing that it impermissibly nullified their votes. The court rejected this argument, however, because the revised plan fulfilled all their interests as creditors. Bourne, Delise, and Tyler moved for reconsideration, primarily of the phasing rights issue; the court denied the motion. They then appealed to the district court, which took a different view of the matter than did the bankruptcy court.</p>\n<p>Before the district court, Bourne, Delise, and Tyler argued that their Phasing Rights Motion should have been granted and that the revised plan should not have been confirmed. On the confirmation question, they argued in part that the plan was infeasible if Northwood did not have legitimate development rights and in part that Northwood's reclassification of their claims was an impermissible \"gerrymander\" meant to deprive them of a say in Northwood's reorganization.</p>\n<p>The district court held a hearing on November 16, 2006, which focused on the appellees' Phasing Rights Motion. The court issued its order three weeks later, essentially granting the Phasing Rights Motion and holding that Northwood's development rights had not been legitimately extended. <i>In re Northwood Props.,</i> 356 B.R. at 89. It vacated the confirmation of the plan on the grounds that the plan was not feasible without the development rights. <i>Id.</i> In so concluding, the court interpreted the condominium statute as demanding a great degree of precision. That is the first merits issue before us.</p>\n<p>Because the court found the revised plan not feasible and thus vacated the plan's confirmation on that ground, the court did not address the reclassification argument. <i>Id.</i> That is the second issue before us.</p>\n<p>The district court suggested that Northwood could successfully extend its development rights with less than unanimous consent of the unit owners if the Association first agreed that the percentage interests of the opposed unit owners (Bourne and Delise) in the condominium's common areas would remain unchanged. This, of course, would necessitate a greater decrease in the percentage interests of the remaining owners. <i>Id.</i> at 88.</p>\n<p>Upon Northwood's motion, the district court modified its order, remanding the plan confirmation to the bankruptcy court so that Northwood could pursue this suggestion for curing the problem found by the district court. Northwood has appealed to this court both the district court's ruling on the Phasing Rights Motion and its remand of the plan confirmation to the bankruptcy court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> II.</h2>\n<p>A. <i>Standard of Review</i></p>\n<p>In an appeal from district court review of a bankruptcy court order, this court independently examines the bankruptcy court's decision, reviewing findings of fact for clear error and conclusions of law de novo. <i>Official, Unsecured Creditors' Comm. v. Stern (In re SPM Mfg. Corp.),</i> 984 F.2d 1305, 1310-11 (1st Cir. 1993). The district court decision is given no deference. <i>Id.</i> at 1311.</p>\n<p>B. <i>Phasing Rights Motion</i></p>\n<p>1. <i>Appellate Jurisdiction</i></p>\n<p>Appeals in bankruptcy proceedings are governed primarily by 28 U.S.C. § 158, although in <i>Connecticut National Bank v. Germain,</i> 503 U.S. 249, 112 S.Ct. 1146, 117 L.Ed.2d 391 (1992), the Supreme Court clarified that jurisdiction under § 158 was in addition to, not in lieu of, the normal appellate jurisdiction provided by 28 U.S.C. §§ 1291-1292. <i>Id.</i> at 253, 112 S.Ct. 1146. Sitting as an intermediate appellate court, the district court exercised jurisdiction under § 158(a)(1) in reviewing the \"final judgments, orders, and decrees\" of the bankruptcy court. Both of the bankruptcy court's decisions  denying the Phasing Rights Motion and confirming the revised plan  were final as required by § 158(a)(1).</p>\n<p>The circuit courts have further appellate jurisdiction over \"all final decisions, judgments, orders, and decrees\" issued by the district court sitting in its appellate capacity in bankruptcy proceedings. 28 U.S.C. § 158(d)(1); <i>see also</i> 28 U.S.C. § 1291. This limitation on our appellate jurisdiction recognizes that \"the `finality' of a bankruptcy court's decision may be affected by the district court's disposition of the appeal.\" <i>Bowers v. Conn. Nat'l Bank,</i> 847 F.2d 1019, 1022 (2d Cir.1988). Requiring the bankruptcy court's decision to be truly final, which requires the district court's appellate review to be final, avoids piecemeal appellate review before this court, thereby conserving judicial resources. <i>In re St. Charles Pres. Investors, Ltd.,</i> 916 F.2d 727, 729 (D.C.Cir.1990). However, \"because bankruptcy cases typically involve numerous controversies bearing only a slight relationship to each other, `finality' is given a flexible interpretation in bankruptcy.\" <i>In re G.S.F. Corp.,</i> 938 F.2d 1467, 1473 (1st Cir.1991), <i>abrogated on different grounds by Conn. Nat'l Bank,</i> 503 U.S. 249, 112 S.Ct. 1146, 117 L.Ed.2d 391.</p>\n<p>The district court's ruling on the Phasing Rights Motion is a final determination under § 158(d). \"To be final, a bankruptcy order need not resolve all of the issues in the proceeding, but it must finally dispose of all the issues pertaining to a discrete dispute within the larger proceeding.\" <i>Perry v.

Corp.,</i> 711 F.2d 441, 444 (1st Cir. 1983). The Phasing Rights Motion is essentially a declaratory action, seeking a judicial determination as to whether Northwood's development rights have been legitimately extended. Although the motion does not finally resolve all disputes between Northwood and Bourne and Delise, it does resolve a discrete dispute that was instigated <i>before</i> Bourne and Delise became creditors of Northwood. That is, it definitively resolves Bourne and Delise's rights as condominium owners, even if not their rights as creditors.<sup>[2]</sup> We have jurisdiction over this question under § 158(d).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> 2. <i>The Condominium Statute</i></p>\n<p>Condominiums are governed in Massachusetts by chapter 183A of the Massachusetts General Laws. Chapter 183A \"is essentially an enabling statute, setting out a framework for the development of condominiums in the Commonwealth, while providing developers and unit owners with planning flexibility. Such flexibility is particularly important with respect to phased condominium developments where long-term financial and market conditions may be uncertain.\" <i>Queler v. Skowron,</i> 438 Mass. 304, 780 N.E.2d 71, 77 (Mass.2002) (citation omitted); <i>see also Tosney v. Chelmsford Vill. Condo. Ass'n,</i> 397 Mass. 683, 493 N.E.2d 488, 490 (1986); <i>Barclay v. DeVeau,</i> 384 Mass. 676, 429 N.E.2d 323, 326 (1981).</p>\n<p>Phasing allows developers to sell units as they are built, which in turn eases construction costs and financing arrangements. The flexibility to revise plans as market and financing conditions change also greatly assists condominium development. The state legislature significantly revised the condominium statute in 1998, adding the key provision in question here and increasing the powers of unit owners' associations vis-à-vis individual unit owners. It did so in recognition of \"a shortage of affordable housing stock based upon the expiration of the right to add additional condominium units and land in numerous condominiums created pursuant to chapter 183A.\" 1998 Mass. Adv. Legis. Serv. 242 (LexisNexis).</p>\n<p>We turn to section 5 of chapter 183A with these policy concerns in mind. Because neither the Supreme Judicial Court nor the Massachusetts Appeals Court has interpreted the relevant provisions of section 5 since it was last amended in 1998, we address the question ab initio. As with all statutory interpretation questions, we focus on the language of the statute itself.</p>\n<p>Section 5(b)(2) describes the authority and powers of a condominium's unit owners' association, which includes the power to \"[e]xtend, revive or grant rights to develop the condominium, including the right to add additional units or land to the condominium.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 183A, § 5(b)(2)(iii). It is not disputable that the Association's extension of Northwood's development rights met the requirements of section 5(b)(2)(iii). As required by that provision, the master deed authorized additional units, and the eighty-three percent approval rate by the Association's members of the extension surpassed the seventy-five percent set by the statute as a default percentage. <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p>The extension of the time to exercise development rights, however, is distinct from the ability to exercise those rights under the statute. The addition of units reduces the percentage interest each unit owner holds in the condominium's common areas. State law provides some protection for unit owners in this context. Under section 5(b)(1), a unit owner's percentage interest in the common areas cannot <span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> be \"materially affected\" without his or her consent.</p>\n<p>Northwood broadly argues that section 5(b)(2)(iii) operates independently from section 5(b)(1) and that unit owners have necessarily waived their rights under section 5(b)(1) through their acceptance of any master deed. We disagree in light of the language in section 5(b) that \"[i]n the event of any conflict between the provisions of this subsection and of the master deed, . . . this subsection shall control.\"</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, state law also provides that the requisite consent can be inferred from the unit owner's acceptance of the master deed if, at the time the unit deed was recorded, the master deed (1) provided for the additional units and (2) \"made possible an accurate determination of the alteration of each unit's [percentage] interest that would result\" from the construction of the additional units. <i>Id.</i> § 5(b)(1). The master deed in this case clearly provided for additional units. The ability of Northwood to exercise its development rights thus hinges on the interpretation of this second clause, particularly the phrase \"an accurate determination of the alteration of each unit's [percentage] interest.\"</p>\n<p>The district court interpreted this phrase too narrowly. On its reading, an \"accurate determination\" is the same as \"precise calculations.\" <i>In re Northwood Properties,</i> 356 B.R. at 87. Because the master deed did not make it possible for Bourne and Delise \"to calculate <i>precisely</i> what their new percentage interests would be following the completion of any additional phases,\" the court concluded, Northwood must obtain their express consent before constructing any further units. <i>Id.</i> at 89 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>To impose a requirement of precise calculations of what the new percentage interests would be upon development, however, runs counter to the statute's underlying policies of flexibility and pragmatism as well as the language of related provisions. It is also inconsistent with the approach taken by the state courts in interpreting this statute.</p>\n<p>As a matter of statutory construction, section 5(a) is closely related to the provision in dispute here, and that section states that a unit owner's percentage interest \"shall be in the approximate relation that the fair value of the unit . . . bears to the . . . aggregate fair value of all the units\" at the time the unit deed is recorded. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 183A, § 5(a). Terms like \"approximate\" and \"fair value\" reflect a statutory approach of allowing developers flexibility within a reasonably limited range, not an approach requiring absolute precision. We see no reason why greater requirements for precision would be imposed under section 5(b)(1).</p>\n<p>Further, in practice, the district court's reading would tie the hands of developers, making it impossible for them to respond to changing market conditions. This would seriously jeopardize developers' ability to secure financing to complete projects. This in turn could have an adverse impact on present owners of units. And it implicates the legislature's concern about removing impediments to developing more housing in the Commonwealth. Thus we read the key phrase, \"made possible an accurate determination,\" as not requiring the degree of precision the district court posited.</p>\n<p>Our reading is more consistent than that of the district court with the approach taken by state courts in interpreting Chapter 183A. That statute as a whole is an enabling statute. <i>Tosney,</i> 493 N.E.2d at 490. It sets forth minimum requirements but also provides for flexibility. Included in that flexibility, and meant for the benefit of both unit owners and developers, is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> the ability to adapt the size and scope of a project in response to market conditions by phasing the development over some years. <i>See </i><i>Queler,</i> 780 N.E.2d at 77; <i>Podell,</i> 651 N.E.2d at 860 n. 3.</p>\n<p>We need not determine here the bare minimum a master deed need include to satisfy the constructive consent provision of section 5(b)(1). And it is better for the state courts to themselves articulate the correct standard to apply. What was in the master deed in this case, in our view, was enough.</p>\n<p>The master deed stated how the percentage interests would be calculated. It explained that the original schedule of percentage interests had been calculated \"in conformance with Chapter 183A, upon the approximate relation which the fair market value of each Unit . . . bears to the aggregate fair market value of all the Units\"; that is, the deed treats \"conformance with Chapter 183A\" as equivalent to the standard set by section 5(a). In the same paragraph, the master deed states that \"such percentage interests [shall be] modified in conformance with Chapter 183A\" following the construction of additional phases. Thus Bourne and Delise knew that their percentage interest would continue to track the approximate ratio of the value of their units to the value of all the units.</p>\n<p>The master deed also provided enough information about future phases to allow a reasoned and reasonable approximation of what the aggregate fair value might be. There would be at most sixty-six units, the construction of which would be of equal quality to the existing units. The blueprint of the proposed full development, included with the master deed, showed that two additional buildings would have the same footprint as the two existing buildings and that the remaining building would be slightly larger; this implies that the future units would not be grossly disproportional in size to the existing units. The master deed, by definition, cannot precisely predict the future at the time of its execution. It can, however, set forth reliable and accepted methodologies and provide an accurate description of planned development.</p>\n<p>This amount of information is sufficient to allow both the Association and Bourne and Delise to accurately determine how their percentage interests would be affected. They were not caught by surprise or unfairly treated. Bourne and Delise argue that the fact that Northwood and the Association offered two different predictions of their future percentage interests in itself proves that no \"accurate determination\" was possible, but the very small range between Northwood's prediction of 1.52% and the Association's prediction of 1.43%  a 0.09% difference  does not mean that no \"accurate\" determination was possible.</p>\n<p>The master deed \"made possible an accurate determination of the alteration of each unit's [percentage] interest that would result\" from the completion of further phases. As such, Bourne and Delise consented to the future alteration of their percentage interests when they recorded their unit deeds. Northwood may thus exercise the development rights legitimately extended by the Association under section 5(b)(2)(iii).</p>\n<p>C. <i>Confirmation of the Reorganization Plan</i></p>\n<p>We have jurisdiction, in these circumstances, to reach the issue of the confirmation of Northwood's plan. The district court did not consider two other objections made by Bourne, Delise, and Tyler to that confirmation. As our review of these issues is de novo and on the record from the bankruptcy court, we can and do resolve them ourselves. <i>See </i><i>Advanced Testing</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> <i>Techs., Inc. v. Desmond (In re Computer Eng'g Assocs., Inc.),</i> 337 F.3d 38, 45 (1st Cir.2003) (\"Our review of the district court's decision amounts to review of the bankruptcy court's decision in the first instance.\"); <i>In re SPM Mfg. Corp.,</i> 984 F.2d at 1310-11 (\"In an appeal from district court review of a bankruptcy court order, the court of appeals <i>independently reviews the bankruptcy court's decision</i>. . . .\") (emphasis added). Given the lengthy history of this dispute and the need to avoid piecemeal litigation, we decline to remand to the district court, with the attendant expense and delay, to address issues fully briefed before us that we can resolve. We turn to the two other objections.</p>\n<p>We reject the claim that there has been a violation of the Statute of Frauds. No separate written document was needed as this dispute concerns no sale of real property. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 259, § 1 (\"[n]o action shall be brought . . . [u]pon a contract for the sale of lands, tenements . . . or of any interest in or concerning them\" unless the contract is in writing and signed by the party to be charged).</p>\n<p>The appellees' second objection is that they were erroneously grouped into an artificial convenience class in the revised plan in order to orchestrate acceptance of the plan. The bankruptcy court found that \"the reclassification improves the financial position of Bourne, Delise, and Tyler by providing for full payment of their claims and, hence, does not adversely affect them.\" There was no error, much less clear error, in this finding. Once their interests as creditors are fully protected, Bourne, Delise, and Tyler have no legitimate grounds for objecting to the reorganization plan.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>We reverse the decision of the district court, affirm the bankruptcy court's confirmation of the reorganization plan, and remand the case to that court for any further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Costs are awarded to Northwood.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The alleged debt is related to ongoing legal battles over zoning and permitting stretching back to the initiation of the Northwood at Sudbury development in 1998.</p>\n<p>[2]  Although the district court remanded the bankruptcy court's ruling on the Phasing Rights Motion, that remand pertained to a purely ministerial task, the entry of an order granting the motion. This does not affect the finality of the district court's determination. <i>See </i><i>In re Gould &amp; Eberhardt Gear Mach. Corp.,</i> 852 F.2d 26, 29 (1st Cir.1988) (\"When a remand leaves only ministerial proceedings, . . . then the remand may be considered final [in terms of § 158(d)].\"); <i>see also, e.g., </i><i>Aegis Specialty Mktg. Inc. v. Ferlita (In re Aegis Specialty Mktg. Inc. of Ala.),</i> 68 F.3d 919, 921 (5th Cir.1995) (considering \"the entry of an order by the bankruptcy court in accordance with the district court's decision\" to be only a ministerial proceeding such that the district court's remand was a final order).</p>\n\n</div>",

We reverse the district court, <i>In re Northwood Props., LLC,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1980024\"><a href=\"/opinion/1980024/in-re-northwood-properties-llc/\"><span class=\"volume\">356</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span> (D.Mass.2006), because its statutory interpretation was in error.</p>\n<p>Northwood Properties, LLC, (\"Northwood\") is the developer of Northwood at Sudbury, a partially completed condominium project. Northwood is currently attempting to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. At every turn, its reorganization has been opposed by three individuals: Sidney Bourne, Claudio Delise, and Ralph Tyler. Bourne and Delise are residents of Northwood at Sudbury; all three are creditors of Northwood. Bourne and Delise vigorously oppose Northwood's attempt to extend its rights to finish developing Northwood at Sudbury, rights which were set by the original master deed to expire in 2005. Without the extension of these rights, Northwood's efforts at reorganization will likely fail.</p>\n<p>This discrete dispute turns on a provision in the Massachusetts condominium statute which provides that a condominium owner constructively consents to the addition of further units \"if the master deed at the time of the recording of the unit deed . . . made possible an accurate determination of the alteration of each unit's undivided interest that would result therefrom.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 183A, § 5(b)(1). This provision has yet to be interpreted by the Supreme Judicial Court or the Massachusetts Appeals Court.</p>\n<p>Further, Bourne, Delise, and Tyler all oppose Northwood's reorganization plan, offering their own in its place. Under their plan, they would take control of the reorganized development company, Bourne and Delise would be paid for their consent to further development, and Tyler would receive a large settlement for his long-running litigation against Northwood at Sudbury. The three appellees also argue that Northwood's final plan denied them a vote in its confirmation by leaving their rights as creditors unimpaired.</p>\n<p>The bankruptcy court held that Northwood had successfully extended its development rights; rejected Bourne, Delise, and Tyler's voting complaint; and confirmed Northwood's plan. The district court, sitting as an intermediate appellate court, interpreted section 5 of chapter 183A to hold that Northwood had <i>not</i> successfully extended its development rights. <i>In re Northwood Props.,</i> 356 B.R. at 89. Because it remanded the issue of confirmation of Northwood's plan for reconsideration in light of this ruling, it did not consider the voting argument. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>We hold that we have jurisdiction over both disputes, hold that the district court's interpretation of the condominium statute was in error, reverse the district court's ruling on the validity of Northwood's development rights, find the district court's remand moot on the grounds stated, and affirm the bankruptcy court's confirmation of the reorganization plan.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Northwood at Sudbury was originally envisioned as a six-building complex <span class=\"star-pagination\">*19</span> that would offer residential care to the residents of its sixty-six condominium units. The master deed for the condominium was recorded on December 9, 1998, following the completion of the first phase of development, which consisted of one twelve-unit building. As the Massachusetts Appeals Court has explained, \"[i]n a phased condominium development, groups or stages of units are completed over a period of several years and become part of the condominium by successive amendments to the master deed. `Phasing' is not a statutory term, but is a usage that has grown out of the general enabling provisions\" of the condominium statute. <i>Podell v. Lahn,</i> 38 Mass.App.Ct. 688, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">651</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">859</span></span>, 860 n. 3 (1995). The deed allowed for four additional phases of construction to complete the project, but it set those development rights to expire on December 9, 2005.</p>\n<p>The master deed was amended on May 20, 2002, to account for the completion of the second phase, which consisted of another twelve-unit building and a clubhouse. Bourne and Delise each purchased a unit built in this second phase. No further phases have yet been undertaken.</p>\n<p>In advance of the expiration of its development rights, Northwood negotiated an extension of those rights with the condominium unit owners' association (\"Association\") in exchange for $700,000. Even though Northwood had filed for bankruptcy in the interim, twenty unit owners approved the extension, two abstained, and two  Bourne and Delise  voted against it. This eighty-three percent approval was more than sufficient under the master deed to extend the development rights until December 9, 2010.</p>\n<p>When Northwood filed for bankruptcy in September 2005, there were five unsecured claims held by non-insider creditors: (1) $50.00 owed to NStar; (2) $50.00 owed to KeySpan; (3) $305.92 owed to GZA GeoEnvironmental; (4) $622,270 allegedly owed to Ralph Tyler; and (5) approximately $1.5 million owed to the Association. Northwood disputed the debt claimed by Tyler; the legitimacy of that claim is still pending before the bankruptcy court.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Bourne and Delise filed a Phasing Rights Motion in Northwood's bankruptcy proceedings in February 2006, seeking a determination that the extension of development rights was not valid without their consent. In March 2006, Bourne, Delise, and Tyler each purchased, respectively, the NStar debt, the GZA GeoEnvironmental debt, and the KeySpan debt. By becoming creditors of Northwood, they improved their ability to oppose Northwood's Chapter 11 reorganization plan and gained the opportunity to submit their own.</p>\n<p>Northwood filed its first proposed reorganization plan in May 2006. Under this plan, the five unsecured, non-insider claims were grouped together and would initially receive approximately five percent of the allowed amount of those claims. Proceeds from either future condominium sales or the sale of Northwood's development rights would then be distributed pro rata among the claims. As relevant here, a claim is impaired under a reorganization plan if the plan does not \"leave[ ] unaltered the legal, equitable, and contractual rights to which such claim . . . entitles the holder of such claim.\" 11 U.S.C. § 1124(1). Because their interests were impaired under this plan, Bourne, Delise, and Tyler had a controlling vote over the plan's confirmation, which they opposed.</p>\n<p>Northwood then submitted a revised version of its plan in July 2006. This <span class=\"star-pagination\">*20</span> version grouped the NStar, KeySpan, and GZA GeoEnvironmental debts into a convenience class; these claims, including interest, would be paid in full immediately. Tyler's original claim was placed in its own class and would be paid in full with interest once a final, non-appealable order allowing the claim was entered. This left the Association's claim in its own class, to be paid over time by Northwood's future earnings as under the first proposed plan. Because the interests of Bourne, Delise, and Tyler were no longer impaired under this plan, their votes were not required for the plan's confirmation. The Association, whose interests remained impaired, voted to accept the plan.</p>\n<p>In July 2006, the bankruptcy court denied Bourne and Delise's Phasing Rights Motion, rejecting their argument that, despite the vote of the Association, no development rights could be extended without their specific consent. The court then conducted a confirmation hearing on Northwood's revised plan and approved it. Bourne, Delise, and Tyler objected to the reclassification of claims under the revised plan, arguing that it impermissibly nullified their votes. The court rejected this argument, however, because the revised plan fulfilled all their interests as creditors. Bourne, Delise, and Tyler moved for reconsideration, primarily of the phasing rights issue; the court denied the motion. They then appealed to the district court, which took a different view of the matter than did the bankruptcy court.</p>\n<p>Before the district court, Bourne, Delise, and Tyler argued that their Phasing Rights Motion should have been granted and that the revised plan should not have been confirmed. On the confirmation question, they argued in part that the plan was infeasible if Northwood did not have legitimate development rights and in part that Northwood's reclassification of their claims was an impermissible \"gerrymander\" meant to deprive them of a say in Northwood's reorganization.</p>\n<p>The district court held a hearing on November 16, 2006, which focused on the appellees' Phasing Rights Motion. The court issued its order three weeks later, essentially granting the Phasing Rights Motion and holding that Northwood's development rights had not been legitimately extended. <i>In re Northwood Props.,</i> 356 B.R. at 89. It vacated the confirmation of the plan on the grounds that the plan was not feasible without the development rights. <i>Id.</i> In so concluding, the court interpreted the condominium statute as demanding a great degree of precision. That is the first merits issue before us.</p>\n<p>Because the court found the revised plan not feasible and thus vacated the plan's confirmation on that ground, the court did not address the reclassification argument. <i>Id.</i> That is the second issue before us.</p>\n<p>The district court suggested that Northwood could successfully extend its development rights with less than unanimous consent of the unit owners if the Association first agreed that the percentage interests of the opposed unit owners (Bourne and Delise) in the condominium's common areas would remain unchanged. This, of course, would necessitate a greater decrease in the percentage interests of the remaining owners. <i>Id.</i> at 88.</p>\n<p>Upon Northwood's motion, the district court modified its order, remanding the plan confirmation to the bankruptcy court so that Northwood could pursue this suggestion for curing the problem found by the district court. Northwood has appealed to this court both the district court's ruling on the Phasing Rights Motion and its remand of the plan confirmation to the bankruptcy court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> II.</h2>\n<p>A. <i>Standard of Review</i></p>\n<p>In an appeal from district court review of a bankruptcy court order, this court independently examines the bankruptcy court's decision, reviewing findings of fact for clear error and conclusions of law de novo. <i>Official, Unsecured Creditors' Comm. v.

The Phasing Rights Motion is essentially a declaratory action, seeking a judicial determination as to whether Northwood's development rights have been legitimately extended. Although the motion does not finally resolve all disputes between Northwood and Bourne and Delise, it does resolve a discrete dispute that was instigated <i>before</i> Bourne and Delise became creditors of Northwood. That is, it definitively resolves Bourne and Delise's rights as condominium owners, even if not their rights as creditors.<sup>[2]</sup> We have jurisdiction over this question under § 158(d).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> 2. <i>The Condominium Statute</i></p>\n<p>Condominiums are governed in Massachusetts by chapter 183A of the Massachusetts General Laws. Chapter 183A \"is essentially an enabling statute, setting out a framework for the development of condominiums in the Commonwealth, while providing developers and unit owners with planning flexibility. Such flexibility is particularly important with respect to phased condominium developments where long-term financial and market conditions may be uncertain.\" <i>Queler v.

The flexibility to revise plans as market and financing conditions change also greatly assists condominium development. The state legislature significantly revised the condominium statute in 1998, adding the key provision in question here and increasing the powers of unit owners' associations vis-à-vis individual unit owners. It did so in recognition of \"a shortage of affordable housing stock based upon the expiration of the right to add additional condominium units and land in numerous condominiums created pursuant to chapter 183A.\" 1998 Mass. Adv. Legis. Serv. 242 (LexisNexis).</p>\n<p>We turn to section 5 of chapter 183A with these policy concerns in mind. Because neither the Supreme Judicial Court nor the Massachusetts Appeals Court has interpreted the relevant provisions of section 5 since it was last amended in 1998, we address the question ab initio. As with all statutory interpretation questions, we focus on the language of the statute itself.</p>\n<p>Section 5(b)(2) describes the authority and powers of a condominium's unit owners' association, which includes the power to \"[e]xtend, revive or grant rights to develop the condominium, including the right to add additional units or land to the condominium.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 183A, § 5(b)(2)(iii). It is not disputable that the Association's extension of Northwood's development rights met the requirements of section 5(b)(2)(iii). As required by that provision, the master deed authorized additional units, and the eighty-three percent approval rate by the Association's members of the extension surpassed the seventy-five percent set by the statute as a default percentage. <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p>The extension of the time to exercise development rights, however, is distinct from the ability to exercise those rights under the statute. The addition of units reduces the percentage interest each unit owner holds in the condominium's common areas. State law provides some protection for unit owners in this context. Under section 5(b)(1), a unit owner's percentage interest in the common areas cannot <span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> be \"materially affected\" without his or her consent.</p>\n<p>Northwood broadly argues that section 5(b)(2)(iii) operates independently from section 5(b)(1) and that unit owners have necessarily waived their rights under section 5(b)(1) through their acceptance of any master deed. We disagree in light of the language in section 5(b) that \"[i]n the event of any conflict between the provisions of this subsection and of the master deed, . . . this subsection shall control.\"</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, state law also provides that the requisite consent can be inferred from the unit owner's acceptance of the master deed if, at the time the unit deed was recorded, the master deed (1) provided for the additional units and (2) \"made possible an accurate determination of the alteration of each unit's [percentage] interest that would result\" from the construction of the additional units. <i>Id.</i> § 5(b)(1). The master deed in this case clearly provided for additional units. The ability of Northwood to exercise its development rights thus hinges on the interpretation of this second clause, particularly the phrase \"an accurate determination of the alteration of each unit's [percentage] interest.\"</p>\n<p>The district court interpreted this phrase too narrowly. On its reading, an \"accurate determination\" is the same as \"precise calculations.\" <i>In re Northwood Properties,</i> 356 B.R. at 87. Because the master deed did not make it possible for Bourne and Delise \"to calculate <i>precisely</i> what their new percentage interests would be following the completion of any additional phases,\" the court concluded, Northwood must obtain their express consent before constructing any further units. <i>Id.</i> at 89 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>To impose a requirement of precise calculations of what the new percentage interests would be upon development, however, runs counter to the statute's underlying policies of flexibility and pragmatism as well as the language of related provisions. It is also inconsistent with the approach taken by the state courts in interpreting this statute.</p>\n<p>As a matter of statutory construction, section 5(a) is closely related to the provision in dispute here, and that section states that a unit owner's percentage interest \"shall be in the approximate relation that the fair value of the unit . . . bears to the . . . aggregate fair value of all the units\" at the time the unit deed is recorded. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 183A, § 5(a). Terms like \"approximate\" and \"fair value\" reflect a statutory approach of allowing developers flexibility within a reasonably limited range, not an approach requiring absolute precision. We see no reason why greater requirements for precision would be imposed under section 5(b)(1).</p>\n<p>Further, in practice, the district court's reading would tie the hands of developers, making it impossible for them to respond to changing market conditions. This would seriously jeopardize developers' ability to secure financing to complete projects. This in turn could have an adverse impact on present owners of units. And it implicates the legislature's concern about removing impediments to developing more housing in the Commonwealth. Thus we read the key phrase, \"made possible an accurate determination,\" as not requiring the degree of precision the district court posited.</p>\n<p>Our reading is more consistent than that of the district court with the approach taken by state courts in interpreting Chapter 183A. That statute as a whole is an enabling statute. <i>Tosney,</i> 493 N.E.2d at 490. It sets forth minimum requirements but also provides for flexibility. Included in that flexibility, and meant for the benefit of both unit owners and developers, is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> the ability to adapt the size and scope of a project in response to market conditions by phasing the development over some years. <i>See </i><i>Queler,</i> 780 N.E.2d at 77; <i>Podell,</i> 651 N.E.2d at 860 n. 3.</p>\n<p>We need not determine here the bare minimum a master deed need include to satisfy the constructive consent provision of section 5(b)(1). And it is better for the state courts to themselves articulate the correct standard to apply. What was in the master deed in this case, in our view, was enough.</p>\n<p>The master deed stated how the percentage interests would be calculated. It explained that the original schedule of percentage interests had been calculated \"in conformance with Chapter 183A, upon the approximate relation which the fair market value of each Unit . . . bears to the aggregate fair market value of all the Units\"; that is, the deed treats \"conformance with Chapter 183A\" as equivalent to the standard set by section 5(a). In the same paragraph, the master deed states that \"such percentage interests [shall be] modified in conformance with Chapter 183A\" following the construction of additional phases. Thus Bourne and Delise knew that their percentage interest would continue to track the approximate ratio of the value of their units to the value of all the units.</p>\n<p>The master deed also provided enough information about future phases to allow a reasoned and reasonable approximation of what the aggregate fair value might be. There would be at most sixty-six units, the construction of which would be of equal quality to the existing units. The blueprint of the proposed full development, included with the master deed, showed that two additional buildings would have the same footprint as the two existing buildings and that the remaining building would be slightly larger; this implies that the future units would not be grossly disproportional in size to the existing units. The master deed, by definition, cannot precisely predict the future at the time of its execution. It can, however, set forth reliable and accepted methodologies and provide an accurate description of planned development.</p>\n<p>This amount of information is sufficient to allow both the Association and Bourne and Delise to accurately determine how their percentage interests would be affected. They were not caught by surprise or unfairly treated. Bourne and Delise argue that the fact that Northwood and the Association offered two different predictions of their future percentage interests in itself proves that no \"accurate determination\" was possible, but the very small range between Northwood's prediction of 1.52% and the Association's prediction of 1.43%  a 0.09% difference  does not mean that no \"accurate\" determination was possible.</p>\n<p>The master deed \"made possible an accurate determination of the alteration of each unit's [percentage] interest that would result\" from the completion of further phases. As such, Bourne and Delise consented to the future alteration of their percentage interests when they recorded their unit deeds. Northwood may thus exercise the development rights legitimately extended by the Association under section 5(b)(2)(iii).</p>\n<p>C. <i>Confirmation of the Reorganization Plan</i></p>\n<p>We have jurisdiction, in these circumstances, to reach the issue of the confirmation of Northwood's plan. The district court did not consider two other objections made by Bourne, Delise, and Tyler to that confirmation. As our review of these issues is de novo and on the record from the bankruptcy court, we can and do resolve them ourselves. <i>See </i><i>Advanced Testing</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> <i>Techs., Inc. v. Desmond (In re Computer Eng'g Assocs., Inc.),</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"782834\"><a href=\"/opinion/782834/in-re-computer-engineering-associates-inc-debtor-advanced-testing/\"><span class=\"volume\">337</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span>, 45 (1st Cir.2003) (\"Our review of the district court's decision amounts to review of the bankruptcy court's decision in the first instance.\"); <i>In re SPM Mfg. Corp.,</i> 984 F.2d at 1310-11 (\"In an appeal from district court review of a bankruptcy court order, the court of appeals <i>independently reviews the bankruptcy court's decision</i>. . . .\") (emphasis added). Given the lengthy history of this dispute and the need to avoid piecemeal litigation, we decline to remand to the district court, with the attendant expense and delay, to address issues fully briefed before us that we can resolve. We turn to the two other objections.</p>\n<p>We reject the claim that there has been a violation of the Statute of Frauds. No separate written document was needed as this dispute concerns no sale of real property. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 259, § 1 (\"[n]o action shall be brought . . . [u]pon a contract for the sale of lands, tenements . . . or of any interest in or concerning them\" unless the contract is in writing and signed by the party to be charged).</p>\n<p>The appellees' second objection is that they were erroneously grouped into an artificial convenience class in the revised plan in order to orchestrate acceptance of the plan. The bankruptcy court found that \"the reclassification improves the financial position of Bourne, Delise, and Tyler by providing for full payment of their claims and, hence, does not adversely affect them.\" There was no error, much less clear error, in this finding. Once their interests as creditors are fully protected, Bourne, Delise, and Tyler have no legitimate grounds for objecting to the reorganization plan.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>We reverse the decision of the district court, affirm the bankruptcy court's confirmation of the reorganization plan, and remand the case to that court for any further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Costs are awarded to Northwood.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The alleged debt is related to ongoing legal battles over zoning and permitting stretching back to the initiation of the Northwood at Sudbury development in 1998.</p>\n<p>[2]  Although the district court remanded the bankruptcy court's ruling on the Phasing Rights Motion, that remand pertained to a purely ministerial task, the entry of an order granting the motion. This does not affect the finality of the district court's determination. <i>See </i><i>In re Gould &amp; Eberhardt Gear Mach.
