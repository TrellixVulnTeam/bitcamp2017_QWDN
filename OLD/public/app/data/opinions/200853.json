Robert E. Keeton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n              Torruella and Lipez, Circuit Judges,\n           and Schwarzer,* Senior U.S. District Judge.\n\n\n     Thomas A. Barnico, Assistant Attorney General, with whom\nThomas F. Reilly, Attorney General, and David R. Kerrigan,\nAssistant Attorney General, was on brief, for appellant.\n     Harvey A. Schwartz, with whom Laurie Frankl and Rodgers,\nPowers & Schwartz LLP were on brief, for appellee.\n_____________________________\n\n\n                          February 13, 2004\n\n\n\n\n    *\n      Of the   Northern    District   of   California,   sitting   by\ndesignation.\n\f            LIPEZ, Circuit Judge. In 2002, then-Acting Governor Jane\n\nSwift   fired   Christy     Peter   Mihos   and   Jordan   Levy   from   their\n\npositions as members of the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority after\n\nboth men cast votes on the timing of certain toll increases on\n\nroads and tunnels in Massachusetts.         In this action, Mihos brought\n\nsuit against Swift under the First and Fourteenth Amendments and 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983, alleging that Swift violated his First Amendment\n\nrights by removing him in retaliation for voting against her wishes\n\non the toll increases.        Swift filed a motion to dismiss, raising\n\nthe defense of qualified immunity.\n\n            Although the pleadings never advanced beyond Swift's\n\nmotion to dismiss, the district court issued two rulings in this\n\ncase, see Mihos v. Swift, 2002 WL 31455257 (D. Mass. 2002)(\"Mihos\n\nI\") and Mihos v. Swift, 235 F. Supp. 2d 45 (D. Mass. 2002)(\"Mihos\n\nII\").     In its first ruling, the court held that Swift violated\n\nMihos's First Amendment rights, rejected Swift's qualified immunity\n\ndefense, and denied Swift's motion to dismiss the claims against\n\nher in her individual capacity.         In its second ruling, the court\n\nentered a declaratory judgment that Swift violated Mihos's First\n\nAmendment    rights   but   essentially     changed   course   on   qualified\n\nimmunity, ruling that the law protected Swift against claims for\n\ndamages arising from the violation of Mihos's First Amendment\n\nrights.     Specifically, the court entered a final judgment that\n\nincluded these provisions:\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f               (1) Plaintiff, Christy Peter Mihos, is awarded\n               the following declaratory relief: It is hereby\n               declared that Acting Governor Jane M. Swift,\n               acting in her official capacity, violated his\n               legally   protected   rights  by   retaliating\n               against him for his voting, in his official\n               capacity     as     Massachusetts     Turnpike\n               Commissioner, contrary to her communicated\n               wishes.\n\n               (2) All claims    of Mihos for damages and for\n               any other form   of relief beyond that allowed\n               in paragraph      (1) of this judgment are\n               DISMISSED WITH   PREJUDICE.\n\nMihos II, 235 F. Supp. 2d at 63.\n\n               Swift appeals the court's denial of her motion to dismiss\n\nin Mihos I and the declaratory judgment entered against her in\n\nMihos    II.      Mihos   appeals   the   ruling   denying   his   claims   for\n\ndamages.1      For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the denial\n\nof the motion to dismiss, vacate the declaratory judgment and the\n\ndenial of damages, and remand for further proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Three appeals have been filed in this case. The first, 02-\n2521, is Swift's appeal from the court's denial of her motion to\ndismiss in Mihos I. The second, 03-1038, is Mihos's appeal from\nthe court's denial of damages in Mihos II. The third, 03-1090, is\nSwift's appeal from the court's award of a declaratory judgment to\nMihos in Mihos II.      Accordingly, Swift is designated as the\n\"Defendant, Appellant/Cross-Appellee,\" and Mihos is designated as\nthe \"Plaintiff, Appellee/Cross-Appellant.\"\n     Additionally, William F. Galvin, in his official capacity as\nthe Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, is captioned as\nthe \"Defendant\" on these appeals. After a state court proceeding\nordered Mihos reinstated, Mihos's request for injunctive relief\nagainst Swift and Galvin was moot. Consequently, Mihos's motion to\ndismiss the claims against Swift in her official capacity and\nagainst Galvin entirely was granted on October 29, 2002, and there\nis no appeal pending in this matter regarding Secretary Galvin.\n\n                                      -3-\n\f                                  I.\n\n           This case comes to us with two lengthy state court\n\nopinions and two district court opinions already filed.            See Levy\n\nv. The Acting Governor, 435 Mass. 697, 761 N.E.2d 494 (Mass.\n\n2002)(\"Levy I\"); Levy v. The Acting Governor, 436 Mass. 736, 767\n\nN.E.2d 66 (Mass. 2002)(\"Levy II\"); Mihos I, 2002 WL 31455257 (D.\n\nMass 2002); and Mihos II, 235 F. Supp. 2d 45 (D. Mass 2002).\n\nBecause the extensive and undisputed factual background of this\n\ncase has been set forth fully in published opinions, particularly\n\nin Levy II, we will confine our recitation of the facts to those\n\npertinent to our holdings. The findings and analysis of each prior\n\nopinion are discussed below where relevant to the issues now before\n\nus on appeal.\n\n                           A.    Background\n\n           Governor Paul Cellucci appointed Christy Peter Mihos to\n\nthe Massachusetts Turnpike Authority in December 1998 to fulfill\n\nthe unexpired term of a departing member.      In July 1999, Governor\n\nCellucci reappointed Mihos to the Turnpike Authority to a full\n\neight-year term.    In May 2000, Mihos was elected vice-chairman of\n\nthe Turnpike Authority.\n\n           The Turnpike Authority is \"a body politic and corporate\"\n\nand   \"a   public   instrumentality\"    authorized    to    operate      the\n\nMassachusetts   Turnpike   and   certain   other   roads   known    as   the\n\nMetropolitan Highway System, including the Massachusetts Turnpike,\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fits extension into Boston, and the tunnels under Boston Harbor (the\n\nSumner Tunnel, the Callahan Tunnel, and the Ted Williams Tunnel).\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 81A, §§ 1, 3.           Three members, each of whom is\n\nappointed by the Governor, comprise the Turnpike Authority, and a\n\ntwo member quorum is required to conduct business.                Id. at § 2.\n\nThrough agreements with the Massachusetts Highway Department, the\n\nTurnpike Authority is responsible for certain aspects of the design\n\nand construction of the Central Artery/Tunnel Project, commonly\n\nknown as \"the Big Dig.\" Additionally, the Turnpike Authority bears\n\nsole responsibility for establishing tolls for the Turnpike, the\n\nBoston    Harbor   tunnel   crossings,      and   the   Metropolitan    Highway\n\nSystem.\n\n            This toll-setting responsibility gave rise to the dispute\n\nbetween Mihos and Swift.       The Executive Office of Transportation\n\nand Construction, the Turnpike Authority, and Governor Cellucci\n\nreached a consensus in late 1996 or early 1997 that tolls should be\n\nraised in 1997 and again in January 2002.               In April 2001, then-\n\nLieutenant Governor Swift took office as Acting Governor when\n\nCellucci departed to accept an ambassadorial posting.               During the\n\nlatter part of 2001, Mihos and Levy became concerned about the\n\nproposals    to    implement   toll    increases        on   portions   of   the\n\nMassachusetts Turnpike in January 2002.            Following investigations\n\nof the financial impact of the proposed toll increase, including\n\nconsulting with attorneys, financial experts, and bond counsel for\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fthe Authority, Mihos and Levy concluded that the toll increase was\n\nneither necessary as a matter of law nor in the best interests of\n\nthe Turnpike Authority. Swift, however, supported the January 2002\n\nincrease.\n\n             On October 30, 2001, the three Turnpike Authority members\n\nmet.   A motion to raise the tolls in January 2002 failed for want\n\nof a second.    Subsequently, a motion to increase the tolls in July\n\n2002 was made, seconded, and passed in a 2-1 vote, with Mihos and\n\nLevy in favor.     Swift delivered letters to Mihos and Levy dated\n\nNovember 16, 2001, notifying them that she was removing them from\n\ntheir positions as members of the Turnpike Authority.\n\n                      B.    The State Court Proceedings\n\n             Following receipt of those letters, Mihos and Levy filed\n\na verified complaint in the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts\n\nseeking, inter alia, declaratory relief that Swift lacked authority\n\nto remove members of the Turnpike Authority.         The Supreme Judicial\n\nCourt (SJC) rejected that argument and ruled instead that Mass.\n\nGen. Laws ch. 30, § 9 \"confers on the Acting Governor the power to\n\nremove   a   member    of    the   Massachusetts   Turnpike   Authority   in\n\naccordance with the terms of that statute.\"          Levy I, 435 Mass. at\n\n700.\n\n             After this ruling, Swift conducted hearings to determine\n\nwhether she would remove Mihos and Levy from their positions on the\n\nTurnpike Authority for cause.          By letter dated February 6, 2002,\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fSwift notified     Mihos and Levy that she was removing them from\n\noffice, asserting that the principal cause for removal was the\n\nfiscal irresponsibility of their votes at the October 30, 2001\n\nmeeting.    Mihos and Levy again sought review, in the nature of\n\ncertiorari, under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 249, § 4, in county court.\n\nA single justice reversed and referred the matter to the full\n\ncourt.     The SJC held, inter alia, that \"the dispute involves a\n\ndifference of opinion over policy that, in the circumstances, does\n\nnot constitute substantial evidence of cause to remove\" and vacated\n\nthe order of dismissal.    Levy II, 436 Mass. at 737.   Mihos and Levy\n\nwere duly restored to their positions and received back pay.\n\n                  C.   The District Court Proceedings\n\n            In addition to seeking review in state court, Mihos\n\nreserved his right to press his First Amendment claim in federal\n\ndistrict court, which he did simultaneously with the state court\n\nproceedings.2    In his district court complaint, Mihos alleged that\n\nSwift violated his First Amendment rights by retaliating against\n\nhim because of his vote regarding the timing of the toll increases,\n\nand he sought, inter alia, declaratory relief, compensatory and\n\npunitive damages, and attorney's fees.       Swift responded with a\n\n\n\n     2\n      See England v. Louisiana State Bd. of Med. Examiners, 375\nU.S. 411, 421 (1964)(holding that a party may inform the state\ncourt \"that he intends, should the state court[] hold against him\non the question of state law, to return to [federal] District Court\nfor disposition of his federal contentions.\").\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fmotion to dismiss, asserting the defense of qualified immunity.\n\nBoth parties agreed that discovery should be stayed pending the\n\nresolution of the qualified immunity issue.   On October 29, 2002,\n\nthe district court rejected Swift's qualified immunity defense and\n\ndenied her motion to dismiss.   Mihos I, 2002 WL 31455257 at *7-*8.\n\nThe district court then stated that \"[t]he only remaining issue or\n\nissues this court must decide concern what relief to plaintiff is\n\nappropriate,\" and ordered that the parties' arguments on damages\n\nwould be heard at the next case management conference.   Id. at *8.\n\n           Pursuant to the district court's request, the parties\n\nsubmitted memoranda regarding plaintiff's claim for compensatory\n\nand punitive damages, as well as attorney's fees.    Additionally,\n\nplaintiff sought discovery on issues relating to punitive damages.\n\nAfter denying the discovery request, the district court issued an\n\nopinion and final judgment on December 17, 2002.   Mihos II, 235 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 45.    The district court declared that Swift \"violated\n\n[Mihos's] protected rights by retaliating against him for his\n\nvoting.\"   However, even though the district court previously had\n\nruled in Mihos I that Swift was not entitled to qualified immunity,\n\nit held that Swift's own First Amendment interests served as a\n\n\n\n\n                                -8-\n\fshield to damages, essentially granting Swift qualified immunity,3\n\nregardless of the terminology it employed.4\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      We recognize that qualified immunity, in its full scope,\nshields public officials from the burdens of lawsuits and damages.\nSee, e.g., Guzman-Rivera v. Rivera-Cruz 98 F.3d 664, 666 (1st Cir.\n1996)(\"The qualified immunity defense exists not only to shield\nofficials from liability for damages, but also to protect them from\nthe general costs of subjecting officials to the risks of trial. .\n. .\")(internal quotations and citations omitted).\n     4\n         For example, the district court wrote in Mihos II that\n\n             to comport with constitutional and other\n             fundamental principles, [Swift] says qualified\n             immunity should be recognized where a public\n             official is required to exercise her judgment\n             and form an opinion as to a balance between\n             competing interests, so long as the official\n             does not knowingly or recklessly rely upon\n             irrelevant     considerations     or     false\n             information, or ignore contrary information.\n\n             Here, defendant Swift asserts that she\n             exercised her judgment and acted on her\n             opinion in fact-specific circumstances as to\n             which previous cases could only have been of\n             limited assistance as to the appropriate\n             weighing of clashing rights asserted by the\n             parties. Swift says no showing has been made\n             by Mihos that Swift acted in reckless\n             disregard of information not supporting her\n             opinion, or relied upon irrelevant or false\n             considerations. Accordingly, she should be\n             protected from personal liability.\n\n             I conclude that First Amendment precedents\n             identified in all the preceding parts of this\n             opinion support this assertion by defendant\n             Swift.\n\nMihos II, 235 F. Supp. 2d at 57.\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\f              Swift appealed the declaratory judgment in Mihos II and\n\nthe denial of qualified immunity in Mihos I, and Mihos appealed the\n\ndenial of any claim for damages in Mihos II.                 Both parties argue\n\nthat    the    record   before    the   district     court   in   Mihos   II   was\n\ninadequate to support the ruling against them.\n\n\n\n                                        II.\n\n              We first address the district court's rulings in Mihos\n\nII.    Then, because the scope of the record necessarily affects our\n\nanalysis of Swift's qualified immunity defense in Mihos I, we turn\n\nnext to       determining   the    record     that   was   properly   before   the\n\ndistrict court.         Finally, we analyze Swift's qualified immunity\n\ndefense in light of that record.\n\n  A.    The Mihos II Rulings: Declaratory Judgment for Mihos and\n            Judgment for Swift on Mihos's Damages Claim\n\n              Swift seeks reversal of the declaratory judgment that she\n\nviolated Mihos's First Amendment rights, arguing that it was\n\nprematurely entered.        We agree.          For a plaintiff to overcome a\n\nqualified immunity defense, he must show that his allegations, if\n\ntrue, establish a constitutional violation; that the right was\n\nclearly established; and that a reasonable official would have\n\nknown that her actions violated the constitutional right at issue.\n\nSee Suboh v. District Attorney's Office of Suffolk Dist., 298 F.3d\n\n81, 90 (1st Cir. 2002).          However, the denial of qualified immunity\n\nto a defendant does not translate into a victory for a plaintiff on\n\n                                        -10-\n\fthe merits.     A determination that the \"plaintiff's allegations, if\n\ntrue, establish a constitutional violation,\" Hope v. Pelzer, 536\n\nU.S.   730,     736   (2002),   does    not   mean    that   the   plaintiff's\n\nallegations are true.           It simply means that the case may go\n\nforward.       The court had no basis for entering a declaratory\n\njudgment for Mihos on the constitutional violation claim.\n\n              The judgment for Swift on Mihos's damages claim presents\n\na different problem.         Although the district court avoided the\n\nlanguage of qualified immunity in its ruling against Mihos, its\n\nconclusion that Swift did not have to answer in damages for a\n\nviolation of Mihos's First Amendment right was tantamount to a\n\nqualified immunity victory for Swift.                As such, the denial of\n\ndamages in Mihos II was a reversal of the district court's ruling\n\nin Mihos I, which rejected Swift's qualified immunity defense\n\nentirely.      The overriding question is which qualified immunity\n\nruling was correct. If the court's rejection of qualified immunity\n\nin Mihos I was right, its acceptance of qualified immunity in Mihos\n\nII was wrong.      For reasons we shall explain, the district court's\n\nfirst ruling was correct.        Consequently, the district court erred\n\nin dismissing Mihos's damages claim.\n\n                        B.   The Scope of the Record\n\n              When a motion to dismiss is based on the complaint, as it\n\nis here, the facts alleged in the complaint control.               Behrens v.\n\nPelletier 516 U.S. 299, 309 (1996)(\"[T]he legally relevant factors\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\f. . . will be different on summary judgment than on an earlier\n\nmotion to dismiss.     At that earlier stage, it is the defendant's\n\nconduct as   alleged   in    the   complaint    that   is   scrutinized    for\n\n'objective legal reasonableness.'\")(emphasis in the original); see\n\nalso Dirrane, 315 F.3d at 69 n.2.          However, as always, there are\n\nexceptions to the rule.      Watterson v. Page, 987 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.\n\n1993)(describing \"narrow exceptions for documents the authenticity\n\nof which are not disputed by the parties; for official public\n\nrecords;   for   documents    central   to    plaintiff's    claim;   or   for\n\ndocuments sufficiently referred to in the complaint.\")\n\n           At issue here is whether and to what extent one of these\n\nexceptions encompasses the SJC's decision in Levy II.           That is, we\n\nmust determine whether the decision of the SJC in Levy II changed\n\nthe rules applicable to a motion to dismiss when evaluating Mihos's\n\nclaim in his federal lawsuit that Swift's motivation for firing him\n\nwas constitutionally proscribed.        In her reply brief, Swift neatly\n\nsums up the course of action taken by the district court:                  \"the\n\nDistrict Court assumed the facts alleged in the complaint to be\n\ntrue, disregarded allegations concerning the subjective intent of\n\nthe Governor [and] relied on the decisions of the Supreme Judicial\n\nCourt to explain the course of the proceedings and the Governor's\n\nstated grounds for removal. . . .\"           We agree with Swift that this\n\nis the course of action the district court took; however, that\n\ncourse was misguided.\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\f              Because Swift's \"motivation in effecting the discharge is\n\nan   essential      element    of    [Mihos's]      constitutional        claim,\"   the\n\nmotivations      for   Swift's       actions       are   crucial     to   this     case.\n\nFeliciano-Angulo v. Rivera-Cruz, 858 F.2d 40, 45 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\nAs we explain in Part C.1.b. infra, the motivation element of the\n\nconstitutional claim does not disappear at the qualified immunity\n\nstage.    Acevedo-Garcia v. Vera-Monroig, 204 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir.\n\n2000)(affirming        \"the        rightness       of    the    district        court's\n\nconsideration of motivation in rejecting the qualified immunity\n\ndefense. . . .\").\n\n              Here, relying on Levy II for findings about Swift's\n\nmotivations for firing Mihos, the district court found that \"[i]n\n\nthe exercise of her discretion, Swift had concluded that Mihos'[s]\n\n'acts    and     omissions         concerning      the    Authority's       finances,\n\nparticularly        during    the     time     period     culminating       with    the\n\nAuthority's October 30, 2001[,] [b]oard meeting and immediately\n\nthereafter,     were    fiscally      irresponsible,       resulting       in   adverse\n\nconsequences of substantially decreasing projected revenues of the\n\nAuthority, damaging the Authority's credit outlook, and creating\n\nfinancial instability.'\"            Mihos II, 235 F. Supp. 2d at 48 (quoting\n\nLevy    II,   436   Mass.     at    744).      Similarly,      the   district      court\n\ndetermined, based on Levy II, that \"Swift further found that the\n\nalternative revenue plan prepared by Mihos was created 'hurriedly'\n\nand in a 'haphazard' manner, and that it did not 'adequately'\n\n\n                                            -13-\n\fcompensate for the revenues that had been lost as a result of\n\n[Mihos's and Levy's] actions.\"          Mihos II, 235 F. Supp. 2d at 48\n\n(quoting Levy II, 436 Mass. at 746)(alterations in the original).\n\n            Based on these findings, the district court \"conclude[d]\n\nthat these claims by Mihos are barred by the First Amendment and\n\nother protections against an award of damages for the good faith\n\nperformance    of   public   duties    by    the   Acting    Governor   of    the\n\nCommonwealth.\"      Mihos II, 235 F. Supp. 2d at 62 (emphasis added).\n\nFurther, the district court characterized Swift as \"an energetic,\n\nstrong, and committed governor . . . who has rendered creditable\n\nservice to the public by standing fast in the assertion of deeply\n\nheld convictions.\" Id. Finally, the district court found that the\n\n\"expressive elements of Swift's actions arise out of the exercise\n\nof her discretion in performing her duties as the Acting Governor\n\nof   the   Commonwealth.       Swift   was    required      to   exercise    that\n\ndiscretion because she was faced with what she perceived to be,\n\namong other things, gross fiscal irresponsibility on the part of\n\n[Mihos.]\"     Id. at 57-58.5\n\n\n      5\n      In reciting these reasons from Levy II, the district court\nignored language in Levy II finding that many of the non-\nretaliatory reasons for the terminations advanced by Swift were\nsupported by \"no evidence.\" See, e.g., Levy II, 436 Mass. at 749-\n51 (\"There was no evidence that the vote to 'delay' the toll\nincreases violated any covenant in the 1997 and 1999 trust\nagreements or their corresponding bond prospectuses. . . . There\nis no evidence that Levy and Mihos failed to do anything legally\nrequired of them. . . . There is no requirement to generate 'new\nrevenues'.     The plan satisfies the Authority's existing\nobligations. . . .   [Mihos's and Levy's] plan had not been the\n\n                                      -14-\n\f          Swift claims that the district court properly relied on\n\nLevy II in making these determinations regarding her motivations\n\nfor firing Mihos because, according to Swift, federal courts may\n\ntake judicial notice of related decisions of state courts when\n\nruling on a motion to dismiss.6    In essence, Swift urges that the\n\nSJC's findings in Levy II estop Mihos from alleging in this federal\n\nlawsuit that her motives for firing him were other than those\n\ndescribed by the SJC in Levy II.\n\n          This   argument   misapprehends   the   scope   of   issue\n\npreclusion:   \"When an issue of fact or law is actually litigated\n\nand determined by a valid and final judgment, and the determination\n\nis essential to the judgment, the determination is conclusive in a\n\n\nresult of 'haphazard' planning. . . . There was nothing haphazard\nabout [Mihos's and Levy's] actions. . . .        Contrary to the\nGovernor's contention, there was no obligation to vote on the\nproposed toll increases and the alternative revenue plan at the\nsame time.\")\n\n     6\n      In her reply brief, Swift also urges that Levy II is part of\nthe record because Mihos \"made specific reference to the\nproceedings before the SJC in his complaint.\" See, e.g., Watterson\nv. Page, 987 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1993)(\"documents sufficiently\nreferred to in the complaint\" can be properly considered on a\nmotion to dismiss). In paragraph 16 of the complaint, Mihos stated\nthat \"[f]ollowing proceedings in the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial\nCourt, the defendant Acting Gov. Swift held hearings concerning the\nremoval of Mr. Mihos and Mr. Levy.\" This is the only reference in\nthe complaint to the state court proceedings, and simple chronology\ncompels the conclusion that Mihos was not referring to Levy II: the\ncomplaint was filed almost three months before Levy II was decided.\nWe need not decide whether this reference is sufficient to\nexpressly incorporate Levy I into the record. The findings in Levy\nI are not germane to the issues on appeal, and neither party relies\non Levy I for their legal arguments in the briefs.\n\n                               -15-\n\fsubsequent action between the parties, whether on the same or a\n\ndifferent    claim.\"       Restatement       (Second)    of    Judgments   §    27\n\n(1982)(emphasis added).      It follows from this hornbook definition\n\nof issue preclusion that the district court made improper use of\n\nLevy II in deciding Mihos II.         The task before the SJC in Levy II\n\nwas to decide whether Swift's stated reasons for terminating Mihos\n\nsatisfied the \"for cause\" standard.               The SJC did not address\n\nwhether Swift's stated reasons were actually the reasons that\n\nmotivated her actions.      Indeed, the court stated specifically that\n\n\"the Governor's good faith and honest judgment play no part in the\n\ninstant matters affecting the Authority.\"               Levy II, 436 Mass. at\n\n749.   In other words, the SJC accepted Swift's stated reasons as\n\ntrue for purposes of their analysis of \"for cause\" dismissal under\n\nMassachusetts    law.       Mihos's     complaint       alleges    a   different\n\nmotivation: that \"Swift was enraged\" at Mihos's vote and fired him\n\n\"in direct retaliation\" in an act of \"political interference and\n\nintimidation.\"    The district court denied Mihos the opportunity to\n\npursue discovery on these allegations, despite the central role\n\nthat motivation plays in First Amendment political retaliation\n\nclaims.\n\n            We conclude that the district court's reliance on Levy II\n\nin   assessing   Swift's    actual    motivation    for       firing   Mihos   was\n\nimproper since that issue was never litigated.                 As we have said\n\nbefore, \"when two adversaries concentrate in attempting to resolve\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fan   issue   importantly   involved   in   a   litigation,   there   is   no\n\nunfairness in considering that issue settled for all time between\n\nthe parties and those in their shoes.          But . . . it is unfair to\n\nclose the door to issues which have not been on stage center, for\n\nthere is no knowing what the white light of controversy would have\n\nrevealed.\"    Farmington Dowel Prods. Co. v. Forster Mfg. Co., Inc.,\n\n421 F.2d 61, 79 (1st Cir. 1969).\n\n             The statements in Levy II related to Swift's motivation\n\ndo not fall within one of the exceptions to the general rule that\n\nthe facts alleged in the complaint control on a motion to dismiss.\n\nAccordingly, we limit the factual considerations in our qualified\n\nimmunity analysis to the allegations in Mihos's complaint.7\n\n                        C.   Qualified Immunity\n\n             Having ascertained the scope of the record before us, we\n\nnow turn to Swift's qualified immunity defense.              \"[G]overnment\n\nofficials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded\n\nfrom liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not\n\nviolate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of\n\nwhich a reasonable person would have known.\" Harlow v. Fitzgerald,\n\n457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982).         At least to the extent that the\n\nqualified immunity defense turns upon a purely legal question, we\n\n\n      7\n      We need not address at this juncture the exact contours of\nthe proper use of Levy I and Levy II in the proceedings on remand.\nBeyond Swift's attempted reliance on the motivation issue, neither\nparty seeks to bring other findings in the Levy litigation into the\nrecord.\n\n                                  -17-\n\freview qualified immunity determinations de novo.               See Mitchell v.\n\nForsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 530 (1985); see also Suboh v. District\n\nAttorney's Office of Suffolk Dist., 298 F.3d 81, 90 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).\n\n               Drawing on Supreme Court precedent and our own case law,\n\nwe employ a three-part test when determining if a public official\n\nis     entitled    to   qualified   immunity:      (1)    whether   plaintiff's\n\nallegations, if true, establish a constitutional violation; (2)\n\nwhether that right was clearly established at the time of the\n\nalleged violation; and (3) whether a similarly situated reasonable\n\nofficial would have understood that the challenged action violated\n\nthe constitutional right at issue.               Suboh, 298 F.3d at 90.       See\n\nalso Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818-19 (1982).                       The\n\n\"Supreme Court has instructed us to start . . . with the question\n\nof whether the facts as alleged make out a violation of the First\n\nAmendment.\"       Dirrane v. Brookline Police Dept., 315 F.3d 65, 69\n\n(1st    Cir.    2002)(citing   Saucier      v.    Katz,   533   U.S.   194,   201\n\n(2001))(emphasis in original).        Accordingly, we take each of these\n\nissues in turn.\n\n               1. Constitutional Violation\n\n               Because Mihos alleged that Swift violated his First\n\nAmendment rights, the first step in our qualified immunity analysis\n\nbreaks down into a three-part inquiry itself: (1) whether the\n\nspeech involves a matter of public concern; (2) whether, when\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\fbalanced against each other, the First Amendment interests of the\n\nplaintiff and the public outweigh the government's interest in\n\nfunctioning efficiently; and (3) whether the protected speech was\n\na substantial or motivating factor in the adverse action against\n\nthe plaintiff.        Mullin v. Town of Fairhaven, 284 F.3d 31, 37-38\n\n(1st Cir. 2002) (discussing the Supreme Court precedents that\n\nrequire each of these three inquiries: Connick v. Myers, 461 U.S.\n\n138, 147-48 (1983)(matter of public concern requirement); Pickering\n\nv. Board of Educ., 391 U.S. 563 (1968)(balancing requirement); Mt.\n\nHealthy City School Dist. Bd. Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 287\n\n(1977)(substantial factor requirement)).      We address each of these\n\nitems in sequence.\n\n                 a.    Matter of Public Concern\n\n          For purposes of the motion to dismiss, Swift did not\n\ncontest that Mihos's vote on the toll increase was a matter of\n\npublic concern.        Mihos I, 2002 WL 31455257, at *5.     Like the\n\ndistrict court, we pause briefly to address the issue on the\n\nmerits.\n\n          We are guided in this inquiry by the Supreme Court's\n\nholding in Connick: \"Whether an employee's speech addresses a\n\nmatter of public concern must be determined by the content, form\n\nand context of a given statement, as revealed by the whole record.\"\n\n461 U.S. at 147-48.        Mihos's votes against the proposed January\n\n2002 toll increase and for a July 2002 toll increase concerned a\n\n\n                                   -19-\n\fmatter of significant import related to financing the largest\n\nconstruction project in the country.            Further, the timing of the\n\nincreases would affect every person and corporation who used the\n\nTurnpike extension into Boston and the Boston Harbor tunnels.\n\n           \"Where a public employee speaks out on a topic which is\n\nclearly a legitimate matter of inherent concern to the electorate,\n\nthe court may eschew further inquiry into the employee's motives as\n\nrevealed by the 'form and context' of the expression.\" O'Connor v.\n\nSteeves, 994 F.2d 905, 913-14 (1st Cir. 1993).               There is no need\n\nfor further analysis of the \"public concern\" issue.              We conclude,\n\nas did the district court, that Mihos's votes involved a matter of\n\npublic concern, satisfying the first prong of the constitutional\n\nviolation analysis.\n\n               b.    Balancing the Interests\n\n           The next step in determining whether Swift violated\n\nMihos's constitutional rights is to balance the interests of Mihos\n\nand the public in Mihos's speech (his vote) against the \"interest\n\nof the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the\n\npublic   services   it   performs     through    its   employees.    .   .   .\"\n\nPickering, 391 U.S. at 568.     See also Mullin, 284 F.3d at 39.           This\n\nprocess is commonly known as \"Pickering balancing.\"\n\n           It is here, in the Pickering balancing, that Swift's\n\nmotivations   for   firing   Mihos    loom   large.     In    evaluating     the\n\ndefendant’s side of the scale, Pickering and its progeny instruct\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\fcourts to focus on the government’s “legitimate interests in\n\npreventing unnecessary disruptions and inefficiencies in carrying\n\nout its public service mission.” O’Connor, 994 F.2d at 915 (citing\n\nPickering, 391 U.S. at 568-75).            Accordingly, if Swift fired Mihos\n\nbecause she was concerned that the tangible results of his vote\n\nwould negatively affect the efficient functioning of government\n\nservices and the financial standing of the Turnpike Authority, she\n\nwould have weighty interests on her side of the Pickering scale.8\n\nOn the other hand, if Swift fired Mihos in a retaliatory fit of\n\npique because she disagreed with his vote and wished to punish him,\n\nshe would have no legitimate governmental interests on her side of\n\nthe scale.       Indeed, Swift’s true motivation for firing Mihos for\n\nhis vote is a core issue in this case.\n\n               Given the importance of Swift’s motivation for firing\n\nMihos for his vote, we must pause to address Swift’s argument in\n\nher brief that \"the state of mind of the public official is not\n\nrelevant to the question of qualified immunity,\" citing to Harlow\n\nv. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 816-17 (1982).               This argument, along\n\nwith       citations   to   Harlow,   is   often   made   in   First   Amendment\n\nretaliation cases when defendants raise the qualified immunity\n\ndefense.       We are mindful that the Supreme Court in Harlow changed\n\n\n\n       8\n      In making this observation, we express no opinion regarding\nthe preclusive effect, if any, that Levy II might have on remand in\nevaluating the legitimacy of these concerns or Swift’s ability to\ndemonstrate them on the record.\n\n                                       -21-\n\fqualified   immunity   doctrine      to   emphasize   the   objective,   not\n\nsubjective, nature of that inquiry. However, Harlow does not stand\n\nfor the proposition that inquiries into defendants’ subjective\n\nmotivation is inappropriate in the first step of the qualified\n\nimmunity    analysis      in    assessing    whether    an    intent-based\n\nconstitutional violation has been alleged.9\n\n            Prior to Harlow, the third step of the qualified immunity\n\ninquiry consisted of both objective and subjective components: a\n\ndefendant would not be entitled to qualified immunity \"if he knew\n\nor reasonably should have known that the action he took within his\n\nsphere of official responsibility would violate the constitutional\n\nrights of the [plaintiff], or if he took the action with the\n\nmalicious intention to cause a deprivation of constitutional rights\n\nor other injury. . . .\"         Wood v. Strickland, 420 U.S. 308, 322\n\n(1975)(emphasis added).         Under Wood, then, a plaintiff could\n\nusually avoid an adverse pre-trial qualified immunity ruling by\n\nmerely alleging (1) a constitutional violation (2) of clearly\n\nestablished   law   (3)    by   a   public   official   who   either   acted\n\nmaliciously or knew that his actions would deprive the plaintiff of\n\nhis constitutional rights.          This third step involved an inquiry\n\ninto the public official’s subjective state of mind to assess\n\n\n     9\n      Although in many areas of the law there are important\ndistinctions between \"intent\" and \"motive,\" we use them here\ninterchangeably because the Supreme Court does so in its qualified\nimmunity jurisprudence. See, e.g., Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S.\n800, 818 (1982) and Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U.S. 574 (1998).\n\n                                     -22-\n\fwhether   the   official   acted   with   malice   or   was   aware   of   the\n\nconstitutional violation that would flow from his actions.\n\n           Seven years later, in Harlow, the Supreme Court revisited\n\nthe relevance of the public official's subjective state of mind in\n\nthe qualified immunity analysis.          First, the Court noted that\n\n\"[t]he resolution of immunity questions inherently requires a\n\nbalance between the evils inevitable in any available alternative.\"\n\nHarlow, 457 U.S. at 813.       The Court also reiterated its concern\n\nthat allowing insubstantial claims against public officials to\n\nproceed to trial exacted costs on society as a whole, \"includ[ing]\n\nthe expenses of litigation, the diversion of official energy from\n\npressing public issues, and the deterrence of able citizens from\n\nacceptance of public office.\"      Harlow, 457 U.S. at 814.      The Harlow\n\nCourt noted that Wood v. Strickland's \"subjective element of the\n\ngood-faith defense frequently has proved incompatible with our\n\nadmonition . . . that insubstantial claims should not proceed to\n\ntrial . . . [because] an official's subjective good faith has been\n\nconsidered to be a question of fact that some courts have regarded\n\nas inherently requiring resolution by jury.\"            Harlow, 457 U.S. at\n\n816.\n\n           Because of the incompatibility of the subjective inquiry\n\nwith the need to dismiss insubstantial cases prior to trial, the\n\nHarlow Court found that \"the dismissal of insubstantial lawsuits\n\nwithout trial--a factor presupposed in the balance of competing\n\n\n                                   -23-\n\finterests struck by our prior cases--requires an adjustment of the\n\n'good faith' standard established by our decisions.\"       Harlow, 457\n\nU.S. at 814-15. This \"adjustment of the 'good faith' standard\" was\n\na reformulation of the third step of the qualified immunity test to\n\neliminate the good-faith, subjective inquiry: \"We therefore hold\n\nthat    government    officials   performing   discretionary   functions\n\ngenerally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as\n\ntheir conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or\n\nconstitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have\n\nknown.\" Harlow, 457 U.S. at 818 (emphasis added).\n\n            Harlow, then, did not affect the first step of the\n\nqualified immunity analysis: whether plaintiff's allegations, if\n\ntrue, establish a constitutional violation. Certain constitutional\n\nviolations, including First Amendment retaliation claims, include\n\ndefendant's motivations as a foundational element of the tort:\n\nMihos's First Amendment retaliation claim \"has no meaning absent\n\nthe allegation of impermissible motivation.\"       Acevedo-Garcia, 204\n\nF.3d at 11.10        While the Supreme Court has removed from the\n\nqualified immunity analysis inquiries into whether a defendant knew\n\nthat he was violating plaintiff's constitutional rights or acted\n\n\n       10\n      The Supreme Court recently explained again that \"[t]he reason\nwhy retaliating against individuals for their speech offends the\nConstitution is that it threatens to inhibit exercise of the\nprotected right. Retaliation is thus akin to an 'unconstitutional\ncondition' demanded for the receipt of a government-provided\nbenefit.\"    Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U.S. 574, 589 n.10\n(1998)(citations omitted).\n\n                                   -24-\n\fmaliciously to that end, this jurisprudence has not suggested that\n\nthe \"objectification\" of the qualified immunity inquiry somehow\n\nremoves the intent element in the \"subset of constitutional torts\n\n[in which] motivation or intent is an element of the cause of\n\naction.\"   Id.   Accord Johnson v. Ganim, 342 F.3d 105, 117 (2d Cir.\n\n2003)(“Though    the   qualified   immunity   inquiry   is   generally   an\n\nobjective one, a defendant's subjective intent is indeed relevant\n\nin motive-based constitutional torts such as the one alleged by\n\n[plaintiff].”).11\n\n             In Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U.S. 574 (1998), the\n\nSupreme Court confirmed that although Harlow eliminated inquiries\n\ninto the defendant's subjective state of mind in the third step of\n\nthe qualified immunity analysis, it did not eliminate inquiries\n\ninto the defendant's subjective state of mind in the first step of\n\nthe qualified immunity analysis when plaintiff alleges an intent-\n\nbased constitutional tort.         While striking down a heightened\n\npleading requirement for motivation-based constitutional torts, the\n\nCrawford-El Court stated that \"a judicial revision of the law to\n\nbar claims that depend on proof of an official's motive\" was not\n\njustified.    Id. at 592.   The Court went on to explain that \"there\n\nis an important distinction between the 'bare allegations of\n\n\n     11\n      Of course, if the constitutional tort itself does not include\na subjective element such as intent, it would be an error to import\nsuch an element into the qualified immunity assessment of whether\nthe plaintiff's allegations, if true, establish a constitutional\nviolation.\n\n                                   -25-\n\fmalice'    that   would   have     provided   the    basis   for     rebutting   a\n\nqualified immunity defense under Wood v. Strickland [the third\n\nstep] and the allegations of intent that are essential elements of\n\ncertain constitutional claims [the first step].\"               Id.\n\n            Emphasizing its concern with intrusive discovery into a\n\npublic official's state of mind, the Court observed that under\n\nWood, prior to Harlow, allegations of defendant's malicious intent\n\nto cause any injury at all to plaintiff--not just constitutional\n\ndeprivations--\"would have permitted an open-ended inquiry into [the\n\nofficial's] subjective motivation.\" Id.              In contrast, the Court\n\nfound that when assessing intent as an element of a constitutional\n\nviolation, the motivation inquiry is not so broad as to allow\n\ndiscovery on any potential theoretical basis for the cause of\n\ndefendant's alleged animosity towards plaintiff: \"rather, [the\n\nmotivation inquiry] is more specific, such as an intent . . . to\n\ndeter public comment on a specific issue of public importance.\"\n\nId.\n\n            The   Court   then   observed     that    \"existing      law   already\n\nprevents   this   more    narrow    element   of     unconstitutional       motive\n\n[alleged as part of the underlying constitutional tort] from\n\nautomatically carrying a plaintiff to trial.\"                Id.   This is true\n\nbecause a defendant might prevail on a qualified immunity defense\n\nin a case alleging an intent-based constitutional tort, without\n\nneed to inquire as to her motives, if (1) the relevant law was not\n\n\n                                      -26-\n\fclearly established, (2) the plaintiff's speech did not relate to\n\na matter of public concern, or (3) the defendant showed that she\n\nwould have reached the same decision even in the absence of the\n\nemployee's protected speech.    Id. at 592-93.   In consequence, as\n\nnoted by the Crawford-El Court, \"unlike the subjective component of\n\nthe immunity defense eliminated by Harlow, the improper intent\n\nelement of various causes of action should not ordinarily preclude\n\nsummary disposition of insubstantial claims.\"    Id. at 593.\n\n          In Part IV of its opinion in Crawford-El, the Court\n\nrecognized that even though a qualified immunity defense to an\n\nintent-based constitutional tort often can be resolved on grounds\n\nthat avoid inquiries into the government official's motives, that\n\nwill not always be so.   Therefore, the Court found it \"appropriate\n\nto add a few words on some of the existing procedures available to\n\nfederal trial judges in handling claims that involve examination of\n\nan official's state of mind.\"   Id. at 597.   \"First, the court may\n\norder a reply to the defendant's . . . answer under Federal Rule of\n\nCivil Procedure 7(a), or grant the defendant's motion for a more\n\ndefinite statement under Rule 12(e).\"12   Id. at 598.   \"Second, . .\n\n. the district court should resolve [the] threshold question [of\n\n\n     12\n      Fed. R. Civ. P. 7(a) allows a court to \"order a reply to an\nanswer. . . .\"     Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(e) provides that \"[i]f a\npleading to which a responsive pleading is permitted is so vague or\nambiguous that a party cannot reasonably be required to frame a\nresponsive pleading, the party may move for a more definite\nstatement before interposing a responsive pleading.

The Court then noted that \"[i]f the plaintiff's action\n\nsurvives    these     initial    hurdles    and   is   otherwise       viable,       the\n\nplaintiff ordinarily will be entitled to some discovery.                        Rule 26\n\nvests the trial judge with broad discretion to tailor discovery\n\nnarrowly and to dictate the sequence of discovery.\"                Id.       The Court\n\ndescribed the ways in which the district court may limit the\n\nnumber,    length,     subject    matter,     time,    place,     and       manner    of\n\ndepositions and interrogatories, as well as various discovery\n\nscenarios      that   would     facilitate     \"the     prompt     and       efficient\n\nresolution of the lawsuit. . . .\"            Id. at 599.    Finally, the Court\n\nobserved that \"[b]eyond these procedures and others that we have\n\nnot mentioned, summary judgment serves as the ultimate screen to\n\nweed out truly insubstantial lawsuits prior to trial.\" Id. at 600.\n\n              With its careful attention to the ways in which trial\n\ncourts can control the examination of an official's state of mind\n\npre-trial, the Supreme Court acknowledged in Crawford-El that the\n\nadoption of an objective standard for qualified immunity in Harlow\n\ndid not foreclose all state of mind inquiries during the pre-trial\n\nconsideration of qualified immunity when state of mind is an\n\n\n\n\n                                      -28-\n\felement of the constitutional tort.13    Swift misreads Harlow in\n\nasserting that its reformulation of the qualified immunity defense\n\nmakes her motivation in firing Mihos irrelevant to the qualified\n\nimmunity analysis.   Therefore, if the qualified immunity defense\n\n\n\n     13\n      When plaintiffs allege an intent-based constitutional tort,\ndefendants asserting qualified immunity often quote the passage in\nCrawford-El stating that \"improper motive is irrelevant on the\nissue of qualified immunity. . . .\" 523 U.S. at 589. In doing so,\nthey take the passage out of context. In this portion of Crawford-\nEl, the Court is explaining how Harlow removed the subjective\nelements from the third step of the qualified immunity inquiry so\nthat \"bare allegations\" that the defendant maliciously or knowingly\nviolated plaintiff's constitutional rights would no longer suffice\nto overcome a qualified immunity defense. As Crawford-El explains\nin the same paragraph, its holding in Harlow \"that 'bare\nallegations of malice' cannot overcome the qualified immunity\ndefense did not implicate the elements of the plaintiff's initial\nburden of proving a constitutional violation,\" which is the first\nstep in the qualified immunity inquiry. As we have explained, the\nrest of the Crawford-El opinion confirms this point.\n     Indeed, in the footnote immediately preceding the statement\nthat \"evidence of improper motive is irrelevant on the issue of\nqualified immunity,\" Crawford-El quotes an opinion of Justice\nGinsburg, when she was a judge on the District of Columbia Circuit,\nand calls it a \"correct understanding of Harlow. . . .\"\n\n          Had the Court [in Harlow] intended its\n          formulation of the qualified immunity defense\n          to foreclose all inquiry into the defendants'\n          state of mind, the Court might have instructed\n          the entry of judgment for defendants Harlow\n          and Butterfield on the constitutional claim\n          without further ado.      In fact, the Court\n          returned the case to the district court in an\n          open-ended   remand,   a   disposition  hardly\n          consistent with a firm intent to delete the\n          state    of    mind   inquiry     from   every\n          constitutional tort calculus.\n\nCrawford-El, 523 U.S. at 589 n.11 (quoting Martin v. D.C. Metro.\nPolice Dep't, 812 F.2d 1425, 1432 (D.C. Cir. 1987)(alteration and\nemphasis in original)).\n\n                               -29-\n\fproffered in her motion to dismiss does not identify proper grounds\n\napart from motive for dismissing the case, and if the thrust of her\n\nmotion to dismiss is simply to deny that she acted with the\n\nconstitutionally proscribed motive, she is unlikely to succeed.\n\n            Apart from her misguided argument that motivation is\n\nalways irrelevant to the qualified immunity inquiry, Swift only\n\nargues   that     no    constitutional    violation        occurred    because    her\n\ntermination of Mihos was motivated by her legitimate concerns for\n\nthe public's interest rather than by a desire to politically\n\nretaliate against him.           However, as we have previously explained,\n\non a motion to dismiss we must accept as true the allegations in\n\nMihos's complaint about Swift's motivation.                    In the Pickering\n\nbalance, the exercise to which we now return, these allegations\n\nproduce a decisive tilt for Mihos.\n\n            We look first to Mihos’s side of the scale to assess “the\n\ninterests served by [Mihos’s First Amendment activity] – including\n\n[his]    interests       in    communicating,   and    the    interests      of   the\n\ncommunity    in        receiving,    information      on     matters    of   public\n\nimportance. . . .”            O'Connor, 994 F.2d at 915.        Public officials\n\nhave a strong interest in voting their conscience on important\n\nissues without having to suffer retaliatory recriminations from\n\ntheir superiors.         See, e.g., Connick v. Myers, 461 U.S. 138, 149\n\n(1983)(\"[I]t is essential that public employees be able to speak\n\nout freely without fear of retaliatory dismissal.\").                    The public\n\n\n                                       -30-\n\falso has a substantial interest in members of public authorities\n\nbeing able to freely cast their votes in accordance with their best\n\njudgment, without fear of political interference and intimidation.\n\nSee Butz v. Economou, 438 U.S. 478, 506 (1978)(noting \"public\n\ninterest     in    encouraging    the     vigorous   exercise     of   official\n\nauthority\").       Together, Mihos's and the public's interests weigh\n\nheavily on their side of the Pickering balance.\n\n           In turning to Swift's side of the balance, we find almost\n\nnothing because of the posture of this case.                We have already\n\nexplained why the Levy II descriptions of Swift's reasons for\n\nfiring Mihos cannot trump the contrary allegations in Mihos's\n\ncomplaint.        In consequence, the complaint alone sets forth the\n\nfactual allegations that inform our review of this motion to\n\ndismiss.\n\n           In his complaint, Mihos explains that Swift stated in the\n\nFebruary 6, 2002 termination letters that she removed Mihos and\n\nLevy from office principally because their votes were \"fiscally\n\nirresponsible.\"        However,   Mihos's      complaint   then   denies   this\n\ncharge, stating that the motion for which he voted \"was fiscally\n\nsound and in the best interest of the Authority.\"                 Furthermore,\n\nMihos alleged that \"he exercised his best judgment and concluded\n\nthat the January 2002 toll increase was not in the Authority's best\n\ninterests and was not necessary as a matter of law.\"              According to\n\nMihos's complaint, \"Swift was enraged that the Authority failed to\n\n\n                                        -31-\n\fapprove the January 2002 toll increase, which she supported.\"\n\nFurther, Mihos alleged that the actions Swift took against him\n\n\"were in direct retaliation for the votes\" he took regarding the\n\ntolls.    Finally, Mihos alleged that he was \"removed from public\n\noffice before the expiration of his term because of disagreement\n\nwith the way [he] voted on matters of public concern\" and that his\n\ntermination was \"political interference and intimidation.\"              The\n\ndistrict court, and this court on appeal, must accept Mihos's\n\nversion of the dispute.     Accordingly, when considering only the\n\ncomplaint, as we are bound to do, we find a void on Swift's side of\n\nthe scale and the Pickering scale tips decisively in favor of\n\nMihos.\n\n               c.   Substantial Factor\n\n           Having   determined   that    the   Pickering   balance   favors\n\nMihos’s First Amendment rights, we now consider whether his vote\n\nwas a substantial factor in Swift’s decision to fire him.            See Mt.\n\nHealthy City School Dist. Bd. Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 287\n\n(1977).   This “substantial factor” requirement is wholly distinct\n\nfrom the discussion of “motivation” in the previous section.14\n\n\n     14\n      Many of the qualified immunity cases use the phrases\n“substantial factor” and “motivating factor” interchangeably to\ndescribe the causal relationship between the protected conduct and\nthe adverse action taken against the plaintiff. We prefer to use\nthe phrase “substantial factor” to avoid confusion with the earlier\ndiscussion of motivation, where motivation, rather than referring\nto causation, refers to whether Swift was concerned about\nlegitimate government interests or impermissible retaliation. See\nStella, 63 F.3d at 74-75 (explaining that \"plaintiff must show . .\n\n                                  -32-\n\fHere, the inquiry is whether Mihos’s        termination was attributable\n\nto his exercise of his First Amendment rights or to some other\n\nreason unrelated to his vote.     See id.     In short, the issue is the\n\ncausal   link   between   the   protected    conduct   and   the   adverse\n\nemployment action.    For purposes of her motion to dismiss, Swift\n\ndid not contest that Mihos's vote was the reason for her decision\n\nto remove him from the Turnpike Authority. Again, we pause briefly\n\nto address this issue on the merits.\n\n           Mihos and Levy voted against Swift's wishes regarding the\n\ntoll increases on October 30, 2001.           Seventeen days later, on\n\nNovember 16, Swift informed Mihos and Levy that she was removing\n\nthem from office.    Following Levy I and the termination hearing,\n\nSwift notified Mihos and Levy of her decision to remove them for\n\ncause, stating that the principal cause for their removal was their\n\n\"fiscally irresponsible\" votes on October 30, 2001.            The third\n\nmember of the Turnpike Authority, who proposed the January 2002\n\nincreases and voted against the July 2002 toll increases, never\n\nreceived any such communication. Hence, we agree with the district\n\ncourt that, on these facts, there is no serious dispute that\n\n\n\n\n. that his speech was a substantial or motivating factor for the\nadverse action taken against him . . . and the defendant must then\nprove . . . that the employer would have acted in the same way\ntoward the plaintiff ‘even in the absence of the protected\nconduct.’\"(citing Mt. Healthy, 429 U.S. at 287)(internal citations\nomitted)).\n\n                                  -33-\n\fMihos’s vote on the timing of the toll increases was a substantial\n\nfactor in Swift’s decision to remove him from office.\n\n           Having determined that (1) Mihos's vote involved a matter\n\nof public concern, (2) Mihos's and the public's interest are more\n\nweighty on the Pickering scale than Swift's, and (3) Mihos's vote\n\nwas a substantial factor in Swift's decision to fire him, we\n\nconclude that Mihos has alleged a violation of his First Amendment\n\nrights.\n\n           2.    Clearly Established Right\n\n           We now turn to whether Mihos's First Amendment right in\n\nthis case was clearly established at the time Swift decided to\n\nremove him from the Turnpike Authority.\n\n           The   level   of   abstractness    at   which   the   \"right\"   in\n\nquestion is articulated can often determine the outcome of this\n\ninquiry.   In consequence, the Supreme Court has cautioned against\n\napplying   general   definitions   of     constitutional   rights    in    the\n\nqualified immunity context.      Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635,\n\n639 (1987). \"The inquiry into the nature of a constitutional right\n\nfor the purpose of ascertaining clear establishment seeks to\n\ndiscover whether the right was reasonably well settled at the time\n\nof the challenged conduct. . . .\"       Martinez v. Colon, 54 F.3d 980,\n\n988 (1st Cir. 1995).     Additionally, the \"inquiry into whether the\n\nright is clearly established 'must be undertaken in light of the\n\n\n\n\n                                   -34-\n\fspecific context of the case, not as a broad general proposition.'\"\n\nSuboh, 298 F.3d at 93.\n\n           With this guidance in mind, we articulate the First\n\nAmendment right at stake here as the right of a public official to\n\nvote on a matter of public concern properly before his agency\n\nwithout suffering retaliation from the appointing authority for\n\nreasons unrelated to legitimate governmental interests.           We have\n\napplied a similar formulation before: \"[a]lthough we have found no\n\ncases   directly   on   point,   probably   because   it   is   considered\n\nunassailable, we have no difficulty finding that the act of voting\n\non public issues by a member of a public agency or board comes\n\nwithin the freedom of speech guarantee of the first amendment. . .\n\n.   There can be no more definite expression of opinion than by\n\nvoting on a controversial public issue.\"        Miller v. Town of Hull,\n\n878 F.2d 523, 532 (1st Cir. 1989).        We reiterated six years later\n\nthat this right was clearly established:       \"Voting by members of .\n\n. . boards, commissions, and authorities comes within the heartland\n\nof First Amendment doctrine, and the status of public officials'\n\nvotes as constitutionally protected speech [is] established beyond\n\nperadventure of doubt. . . .\" Stella v. Kelley, 63 F.3d 71, 75 (1st\n\nCir. 1995).\n\n           Notwithstanding Stella and Miller, Swift urges that \"a\n\nbalancing test, by its indeterminate nature, makes it highly\n\nunlikely that a public employer, in such circumstances, could be\n\n\n                                   -35-\n\fheld to have violated a clearly established right.\"         In support of\n\nthis proposition, Swift refers to Frazier v. Bailey, quoted by the\n\ndistrict court in Mihos II, holding that when a right is \"subject\n\nto a balancing test, the right can rarely be considered 'clearly\n\nestablished,' at least in the absence of closely corresponding\n\nfactual and legal precedent.\" 957 F.2d 920, 931 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\nHere, though, Miller and Stella provide the \"closely corresponding\n\nfactual and legal precedents\" that would have served to inform a\n\npublic official that Mihos's First Amendment right was clearly\n\nestablished.15\n\n            As Swift acknowledges in her brief, both cases involve\n\nvotes by public officials on matters of public concern and their\n\nsubsequent removal based on those votes.         Swift seeks to downplay\n\ntheir import by emphasizing that Miller and Stella neither applied\n\nthe Pickering balancing test nor addressed \"the limits of the\n\n'right to    vote'   where   the   removing   official   states   that   the\n\nconsequences of the decision rendered by the 'vote' will harm the\n\npublic interest.\"\n\n            Once again, Swift is hampered by the procedural posture\n\nof this case.    Her stated belief that the consequences of Mihos's\n\nvote will harm the public interest cannot trump Mihos's claim of a\n\n\n\n     15\n      Whether a reasonable person in Swift's position would have\nknown that her actions violated that clearly established right is\na different question.    We address that question in the next\nsection.\n\n                                    -36-\n\fpolitically retaliatory motive. As we have explained at length, on\n\na motion to dismiss the factual allegations in the complaint\n\ncontrol.     Hence, Swift's defense of her action cannot serve to\n\ndistinguish Stella and Miller any more than it can weigh on her\n\nside of the Pickering scale.\n\n            3.   The Understanding of a Reasonable Official\n\n            The third step in the qualified immunity analysis, which\n\nembodies the objective standard announced in Harlow, requires us to\n\nanalyze    \"whether   an        objectively     reasonable   officer   in    the\n\ndefendant's position would have understood [her] action to violate\n\nthe plaintiff's rights.\"           Suboh, 298 F.3d 95.        Given the facts\n\nalleged in the complaint, as described in Part I.A. supra, we have\n\nno trouble finding that a reasonable official similarly situated to\n\nSwift would have known that terminating Mihos for his vote violated\n\nhis constitutional rights. Taking the allegations in the complaint\n\nas true, Mihos exercised his best judgment as to the proper course\n\nof action, cast his vote, and was fired in retaliation for that\n\nvote for reasons unrelated to legitimate governmental interests.\n\nNo reasonable public official could have failed to realize that a\n\nmember of a public instrumentality cannot be terminated on such\n\ngrounds    for   voting    on    matters   of    public   concern   within   his\n\nauthority.\n\n            Having found that (1) Mihos's allegations, if true,\n\nestablish a violation of his First Amendment rights, (2) the right\n\n\n                                       -37-\n\fwas clearly established at the time Swift fired him, and (3) a\n\nreasonable public official would have known that the discharge\n\nconstituted a constitutional violation, we find that Swift is not\n\nentitled to qualified immunity.16\n\n                               III.\n\n          For the reasons explained above, we affirm the district\n\ncourt's denial of the motion to dismiss in Mihos I, vacate the\n\ndeclaratory judgment and the denial of damages in Mihos II, and\n\nremand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n          SO ORDERED.\n\n\n\n\n     16\n      Of course, this ruling does not preclude Swift from asserting\nqualified immunity in a subsequent motion for summary judgment or\nat trial. See Guzman-Rivera v. Rivera-Cruz 98 F.3d 664, 669 (1st\nCir. 1996)(holding that the \"defense of qualified immunity may be\nraised and appealed at multiple stages of the trial. . . .\").\nHowever, if the trial court denies the request for summary judgment\nbecause of a genuine issue as to any material fact, including\nmotive, that ruling would not permit an interlocutory appeal. See,\ne.g., Stella, 63 F.3d at 74 (holding that \"a district court's pre-\ntrial rejection of a qualified immunity defense is not immediately\nappealable to the extent that it turns on either an issue of fact\nor an issue perceived by the trial court to be an issue of fact.\").\n\n                               -38-\n\f",

In 2002, then-Acting Governor Jane\n\nSwift   fired   Christy     Peter   Mihos   and   Jordan   Levy   from   their\n\npositions as members of the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority after\n\nboth men cast votes on the timing of certain toll increases on\n\nroads and tunnels in Massachusetts.         In this action, Mihos brought\n\nsuit against Swift under the First and Fourteenth Amendments and 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983, alleging that Swift violated his First Amendment\n\nrights by removing him in retaliation for voting against her wishes\n\non the toll increases.        Swift filed a motion to dismiss, raising\n\nthe defense of qualified immunity.\n\n            Although the pleadings never advanced beyond Swift's\n\nmotion to dismiss, the district court issued two rulings in this\n\ncase, see Mihos v. Swift, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2002</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">31455257</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.

In its first ruling, the court held that Swift violated\n\nMihos's First Amendment rights, rejected Swift's qualified immunity\n\ndefense, and denied Swift's motion to dismiss the claims against\n\nher in her individual capacity.         In its second ruling, the court\n\nentered a declaratory judgment that Swift violated Mihos's First\n\nAmendment    rights   but   essentially     changed   course   on   qualified\n\nimmunity, ruling that the law protected Swift against claims for\n\ndamages arising from the violation of Mihos's First Amendment\n\nrights.     Specifically, the court entered a final judgment that\n\nincluded these provisions:\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f               (1) Plaintiff, Christy Peter Mihos, is awarded\n               the following declaratory relief: It is hereby\n               declared that Acting Governor Jane M. Swift,\n               acting in her official capacity, violated his\n               legally   protected   rights  by   retaliating\n               against him for his voting, in his official\n               capacity     as     Massachusetts     Turnpike\n               Commissioner, contrary to her communicated\n               wishes.\n\n               (2) All claims    of Mihos for damages and for\n               any other form   of relief beyond that allowed\n               in paragraph      (1) of this judgment are\n               DISMISSED WITH   PREJUDICE.\n\nMihos II, 235 F.

Mihos   appeals   the   ruling   denying   his   claims   for\n\ndamages.1      For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the denial\n\nof the motion to dismiss, vacate the declaratory judgment and the\n\ndenial of damages, and remand for further proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Three appeals have been filed in this case. The first, 02-\n2521, is Swift's appeal from the court's denial of her motion to\ndismiss in Mihos I. The second, 03-1038, is Mihos's appeal from\nthe court's denial of damages in Mihos II. The third, 03-1090, is\nSwift's appeal from the court's award of a declaratory judgment to\nMihos in Mihos II.      Accordingly, Swift is designated as the\n\"Defendant, Appellant/Cross-Appellee,\" and Mihos is designated as\nthe \"Plaintiff, Appellee/Cross-Appellant.\"\n     Additionally, William F. Galvin, in his official capacity as\nthe Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, is captioned as\nthe \"Defendant\" on these appeals. After a state court proceeding\nordered Mihos reinstated, Mihos's request for injunctive relief\nagainst Swift and Galvin was moot. Consequently, Mihos's motion to\ndismiss the claims against Swift in her official capacity and\nagainst Galvin entirely was granted on October 29, 2002, and there\nis no appeal pending in this matter regarding Secretary Galvin.\n\n                                      -3-\n\f                                  I.\n\n           This case comes to us with two lengthy state court\n\nopinions and two district court opinions already filed.

Mass 2002).\n\nBecause the extensive and undisputed factual background of this\n\ncase has been set forth fully in published opinions, particularly\n\nin Levy II, we will confine our recitation of the facts to those\n\npertinent to our holdings. The findings and analysis of each prior\n\nopinion are discussed below where relevant to the issues now before\n\nus on appeal.\n\n                           A.    Background\n\n           Governor Paul Cellucci appointed Christy Peter Mihos to\n\nthe Massachusetts Turnpike Authority in December 1998 to fulfill\n\nthe unexpired term of a departing member.      In July 1999, Governor\n\nCellucci reappointed Mihos to the Turnpike Authority to a full\n\neight-year term.    In May 2000, Mihos was elected vice-chairman of\n\nthe Turnpike Authority.\n\n           The Turnpike Authority is \"a body politic and corporate\"\n\nand   \"a   public   instrumentality\"    authorized    to    operate      the\n\nMassachusetts   Turnpike   and   certain   other   roads   known    as   the\n\nMetropolitan Highway System, including the Massachusetts Turnpike,\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fits extension into Boston, and the tunnels under Boston Harbor (the\n\nSumner Tunnel, the Callahan Tunnel, and the Ted Williams Tunnel).\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 81A, §§ 1, 3.           Three members, each of whom is\n\nappointed by the Governor, comprise the Turnpike Authority, and a\n\ntwo member quorum is required to conduct business.                Id. at § 2.\n\nThrough agreements with the Massachusetts Highway Department, the\n\nTurnpike Authority is responsible for certain aspects of the design\n\nand construction of the Central Artery/Tunnel Project, commonly\n\nknown as \"the Big Dig.\" Additionally, the Turnpike Authority bears\n\nsole responsibility for establishing tolls for the Turnpike, the\n\nBoston    Harbor   tunnel   crossings,      and   the   Metropolitan    Highway\n\nSystem.\n\n            This toll-setting responsibility gave rise to the dispute\n\nbetween Mihos and Swift.       The Executive Office of Transportation\n\nand Construction, the Turnpike Authority, and Governor Cellucci\n\nreached a consensus in late 1996 or early 1997 that tolls should be\n\nraised in 1997 and again in January 2002.               In April 2001, then-\n\nLieutenant Governor Swift took office as Acting Governor when\n\nCellucci departed to accept an ambassadorial posting.               During the\n\nlatter part of 2001, Mihos and Levy became concerned about the\n\nproposals    to    implement   toll    increases        on   portions   of   the\n\nMassachusetts Turnpike in January 2002.            Following investigations\n\nof the financial impact of the proposed toll increase, including\n\nconsulting with attorneys, financial experts, and bond counsel for\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fthe Authority, Mihos and Levy concluded that the toll increase was\n\nneither necessary as a matter of law nor in the best interests of\n\nthe Turnpike Authority. Swift, however, supported the January 2002\n\nincrease.\n\n             On October 30, 2001, the three Turnpike Authority members\n\nmet.   A motion to raise the tolls in January 2002 failed for want\n\nof a second.    Subsequently, a motion to increase the tolls in July\n\n2002 was made, seconded, and passed in a 2-1 vote, with Mihos and\n\nLevy in favor.     Swift delivered letters to Mihos and Levy dated\n\nNovember 16, 2001, notifying them that she was removing them from\n\ntheir positions as members of the Turnpike Authority.\n\n                      B.    The State Court Proceedings\n\n             Following receipt of those letters, Mihos and Levy filed\n\na verified complaint in the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts\n\nseeking, inter alia, declaratory relief that Swift lacked authority\n\nto remove members of the Turnpike Authority.         The Supreme Judicial\n\nCourt (SJC) rejected that argument and ruled instead that Mass.\n\nGen. Laws ch. 30, § 9 \"confers on the Acting Governor the power to\n\nremove   a   member    of    the   Massachusetts   Turnpike   Authority   in\n\naccordance with the terms of that statute.\"          Levy I, 435 Mass. at\n\n700.\n\n             After this ruling, Swift conducted hearings to determine\n\nwhether she would remove Mihos and Levy from their positions on the\n\nTurnpike Authority for cause.          By letter dated February 6, 2002,\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fSwift notified     Mihos and Levy that she was removing them from\n\noffice, asserting that the principal cause for removal was the\n\nfiscal irresponsibility of their votes at the October 30, 2001\n\nmeeting.    Mihos and Levy again sought review, in the nature of\n\ncertiorari, under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 249, § 4, in county court.\n\nA single justice reversed and referred the matter to the full\n\ncourt.     The SJC held, inter alia, that \"the dispute involves a\n\ndifference of opinion over policy that, in the circumstances, does\n\nnot constitute substantial evidence of cause to remove\" and vacated\n\nthe order of dismissal.    Levy II, 436 Mass. at 737.   Mihos and Levy\n\nwere duly restored to their positions and received back pay.\n\n                  C.   The District Court Proceedings\n\n            In addition to seeking review in state court, Mihos\n\nreserved his right to press his First Amendment claim in federal\n\ndistrict court, which he did simultaneously with the state court\n\nproceedings.2    In his district court complaint, Mihos alleged that\n\nSwift violated his First Amendment rights by retaliating against\n\nhim because of his vote regarding the timing of the toll increases,\n\nand he sought, inter alia, declaratory relief, compensatory and\n\npunitive damages, and attorney's fees.

Id. at *8.\n\n           Pursuant to the district court's request, the parties\n\nsubmitted memoranda regarding plaintiff's claim for compensatory\n\nand punitive damages, as well as attorney's fees.    Additionally,\n\nplaintiff sought discovery on issues relating to punitive damages.\n\nAfter denying the discovery request, the district court issued an\n\nopinion and final judgment on December 17, 2002.   Mihos II, 235 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 45.    The district court declared that Swift \"violated\n\n[Mihos's] protected rights by retaliating against him for his\n\nvoting.\"   However, even though the district court previously had\n\nruled in Mihos I that Swift was not entitled to qualified immunity,\n\nit held that Swift's own First Amendment interests served as a\n\n\n\n\n                                -8-\n\fshield to damages, essentially granting Swift qualified immunity,3\n\nregardless of the terminology it employed.4\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      We recognize that qualified immunity, in its full scope,\nshields public officials from the burdens of lawsuits and damages.\nSee, e.g., Guzman-Rivera v.

Swift says no showing has been made\n             by Mihos that Swift acted in reckless\n             disregard of information not supporting her\n             opinion, or relied upon irrelevant or false\n             considerations. Accordingly, she should be\n             protected from personal liability.\n\n             I conclude that First Amendment precedents\n             identified in all the preceding parts of this\n             opinion support this assertion by defendant\n             Swift.\n\nMihos II, 235 F.

Both parties argue\n\nthat    the    record   before    the   district     court   in   Mihos   II   was\n\ninadequate to support the ruling against them.\n\n\n\n                                        II.\n\n              We first address the district court's rulings in Mihos\n\nII.    Then, because the scope of the record necessarily affects our\n\nanalysis of Swift's qualified immunity defense in Mihos I, we turn\n\nnext to       determining   the    record     that   was   properly   before   the\n\ndistrict court.         Finally, we analyze Swift's qualified immunity\n\ndefense in light of that record.\n\n  A.    The Mihos II Rulings: Declaratory Judgment for Mihos and\n            Judgment for Swift on Mihos's Damages Claim\n\n              Swift seeks reversal of the declaratory judgment that she\n\nviolated Mihos's First Amendment rights, arguing that it was\n\nprematurely entered.        We agree.          For a plaintiff to overcome a\n\nqualified immunity defense, he must show that his allegations, if\n\ntrue, establish a constitutional violation; that the right was\n\nclearly established; and that a reasonable official would have\n\nknown that her actions violated the constitutional right at issue.\n\nSee Suboh v. District Attorney's Office of Suffolk Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">298</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">81</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 90 (1st Cir. 2002).          However, the denial of qualified immunity\n\nto a defendant does not translate into a victory for a plaintiff on\n\n                                        -10-\n\fthe merits.     A determination that the \"plaintiff's allegations, if\n\ntrue, establish a constitutional violation,\" Hope v. Pelzer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121169\"><a href=\"/opinion/121169/hope-v-pelzer/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>   <span class=\"page\">730</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,     736   (2002),   does    not   mean    that   the   plaintiff's\n\nallegations are true.           It simply means that the case may go\n\nforward.       The court had no basis for entering a declaratory\n\njudgment for Mihos on the constitutional violation claim.\n\n              The judgment for Swift on Mihos's damages claim presents\n\na different problem.         Although the district court avoided the\n\nlanguage of qualified immunity in its ruling against Mihos, its\n\nconclusion that Swift did not have to answer in damages for a\n\nviolation of Mihos's First Amendment right was tantamount to a\n\nqualified immunity victory for Swift.                As such, the denial of\n\ndamages in Mihos II was a reversal of the district court's ruling\n\nin Mihos I, which rejected Swift's qualified immunity defense\n\nentirely.      The overriding question is which qualified immunity\n\nruling was correct. If the court's rejection of qualified immunity\n\nin Mihos I was right, its acceptance of qualified immunity in Mihos\n\nII was wrong.      For reasons we shall explain, the district court's\n\nfirst ruling was correct.        Consequently, the district court erred\n\nin dismissing Mihos's damages claim.\n\n                        B.   The Scope of the Record\n\n              When a motion to dismiss is based on the complaint, as it\n\nis here, the facts alleged in the complaint control.

Similarly,      the   district      court\n\ndetermined, based on Levy II, that \"Swift further found that the\n\nalternative revenue plan prepared by Mihos was created 'hurriedly'\n\nand in a 'haphazard' manner, and that it did not 'adequately'\n\n\n                                            -13-\n\fcompensate for the revenues that had been lost as a result of\n\n[Mihos's and Levy's] actions.\"          Mihos II, 235 F.

Finally, the district court found that the\n\n\"expressive elements of Swift's actions arise out of the exercise\n\nof her discretion in performing her duties as the Acting Governor\n\nof   the   Commonwealth.

There\nis no evidence that Levy and Mihos failed to do anything legally\nrequired of them. . . . There is no requirement to generate 'new\nrevenues'.     The plan satisfies the Authority's existing\nobligations. . . .

There was nothing haphazard\nabout [Mihos's and Levy's] actions. . . .        Contrary to the\nGovernor's contention, there was no obligation to vote on the\nproposed toll increases and the alternative revenue plan at the\nsame time.\")\n\n     6\n      In her reply brief, Swift also urges that Levy II is part of\nthe record because Mihos \"made specific reference to the\nproceedings before the SJC in his complaint.\" See, e.g., Watterson\nv. Page, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"601477\"><a href=\"/opinion/601477/valerie-watterson-v-eileen-page/\"><span class=\"volume\">987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 3 (1st Cir. 1993)(\"documents sufficiently\nreferred to in the complaint\" can be properly considered on a\nmotion to dismiss). In paragraph 16 of the complaint, Mihos stated\nthat \"[f]ollowing proceedings in the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial\nCourt, the defendant Acting Gov. Swift held hearings concerning the\nremoval of Mr. Mihos and Mr. Levy.\" This is the only reference in\nthe complaint to the state court proceedings, and simple chronology\ncompels the conclusion that Mihos was not referring to Levy II: the\ncomplaint was filed almost three months before Levy II was decided.\nWe need not decide whether this reference is sufficient to\nexpressly incorporate Levy I into the record. The findings in Levy\nI are not germane to the issues on appeal, and neither party relies\non Levy I for their legal arguments in the briefs.\n\n                               -15-\n\fsubsequent action between the parties, whether on the same or a\n\ndifferent    claim.\"       Restatement       (Second)    of    Judgments   §    27\n\n(1982)(emphasis added).      It follows from this hornbook definition\n\nof issue preclusion that the district court made improper use of\n\nLevy II in deciding Mihos II.         The task before the SJC in Levy II\n\nwas to decide whether Swift's stated reasons for terminating Mihos\n\nsatisfied the \"for cause\" standard.               The SJC did not address\n\nwhether Swift's stated reasons were actually the reasons that\n\nmotivated her actions.      Indeed, the court stated specifically that\n\n\"the Governor's good faith and honest judgment play no part in the\n\ninstant matters affecting the Authority.\"               Levy II, 436 Mass. at\n\n749.   In other words, the SJC accepted Swift's stated reasons as\n\ntrue for purposes of their analysis of \"for cause\" dismissal under\n\nMassachusetts    law.       Mihos's     complaint       alleges    a   different\n\nmotivation: that \"Swift was enraged\" at Mihos's vote and fired him\n\n\"in direct retaliation\" in an act of \"political interference and\n\nintimidation.\"    The district court denied Mihos the opportunity to\n\npursue discovery on these allegations, despite the central role\n\nthat motivation plays in First Amendment political retaliation\n\nclaims.\n\n            We conclude that the district court's reliance on Levy II\n\nin   assessing   Swift's    actual    motivation    for       firing   Mihos   was\n\nimproper since that issue was never litigated.                 As we have said\n\nbefore, \"when two adversaries concentrate in attempting to resolve\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fan   issue   importantly   involved   in   a   litigation,   there   is   no\n\nunfairness in considering that issue settled for all time between\n\nthe parties and those in their shoes.

We address each of these\n\nitems in sequence.\n\n                 a.    Matter of Public Concern\n\n          For purposes of the motion to dismiss, Swift did not\n\ncontest that Mihos's vote on the toll increase was a matter of\n\npublic concern.        Mihos I, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2002</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">31455257</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5.     Like the\n\ndistrict court, we pause briefly to address the issue on the\n\nmerits.\n\n          We are guided in this inquiry by the Supreme Court's\n\nholding in Connick: \"Whether an employee's speech addresses a\n\nmatter of public concern must be determined by the content, form\n\nand context of a given statement, as revealed by the whole record.\"\n\n461 U.S. at 147-48.        Mihos's votes against the proposed January\n\n2002 toll increase and for a July 2002 toll increase concerned a\n\n\n                                   -19-\n\fmatter of significant import related to financing the largest\n\nconstruction project in the country.

There is no need\n\nfor further analysis of the \"public concern\" issue.              We conclude,\n\nas did the district court, that Mihos's votes involved a matter of\n\npublic concern, satisfying the first prong of the constitutional\n\nviolation analysis.\n\n               b.    Balancing the Interests\n\n           The next step in determining whether Swift violated\n\nMihos's constitutional rights is to balance the interests of Mihos\n\nand the public in Mihos's speech (his vote) against the \"interest\n\nof the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the\n\npublic   services   it   performs     through    its   employees.    .   .   .\"\n\nPickering, 391 U.S. at 568.     See also Mullin, 284 F.3d at 39.           This\n\nprocess is commonly known as \"Pickering balancing.\"\n\n           It is here, in the Pickering balancing, that Swift's\n\nmotivations   for   firing   Mihos    loom   large.     In    evaluating     the\n\ndefendant’s side of the scale, Pickering and its progeny instruct\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\fcourts to focus on the government’s “legitimate interests in\n\npreventing unnecessary disruptions and inefficiencies in carrying\n\nout its public service mission.” O’Connor, 994 F.2d at 915 (citing\n\nPickering, 391 U.S. at 568-75).            Accordingly, if Swift fired Mihos\n\nbecause she was concerned that the tangible results of his vote\n\nwould negatively affect the efficient functioning of government\n\nservices and the financial standing of the Turnpike Authority, she\n\nwould have weighty interests on her side of the Pickering scale.8\n\nOn the other hand, if Swift fired Mihos in a retaliatory fit of\n\npique because she disagreed with his vote and wished to punish him,\n\nshe would have no legitimate governmental interests on her side of\n\nthe scale.       Indeed, Swift’s true motivation for firing Mihos for\n\nhis vote is a core issue in this case.\n\n               Given the importance of Swift’s motivation for firing\n\nMihos for his vote, we must pause to address Swift’s argument in\n\nher brief that \"the state of mind of the public official is not\n\nrelevant to the question of qualified immunity,\" citing to Harlow\n\nv. Fitzgerald, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110763\"><a href=\"/opinion/110763/harlow-v-fitzgerald/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 816-17 (1982).               This argument, along\n\nwith       citations   to   Harlow,   is   often   made   in   First   Amendment\n\nretaliation cases when defendants raise the qualified immunity\n\ndefense.       We are mindful that the Supreme Court in Harlow changed\n\n\n\n       8\n      In making this observation, we express no opinion regarding\nthe preclusive effect, if any, that Levy II might have on remand in\nevaluating the legitimacy of these concerns or Swift’s ability to\ndemonstrate them on the record.\n\n                                       -21-\n\fqualified   immunity   doctrine      to   emphasize   the   objective,   not\n\nsubjective, nature of that inquiry. However, Harlow does not stand\n\nfor the proposition that inquiries into defendants’ subjective\n\nmotivation is inappropriate in the first step of the qualified\n\nimmunity    analysis      in    assessing    whether    an    intent-based\n\nconstitutional violation has been alleged.9\n\n            Prior to Harlow, the third step of the qualified immunity\n\ninquiry consisted of both objective and subjective components: a\n\ndefendant would not be entitled to qualified immunity \"if he knew\n\nor reasonably should have known that the action he took within his\n\nsphere of official responsibility would violate the constitutional\n\nrights of the [plaintiff], or if he took the action with the\n\nmalicious intention to cause a deprivation of constitutional rights\n\nor other injury. . . .\"         Wood v.

Under Wood, then, a plaintiff could\n\nusually avoid an adverse pre-trial qualified immunity ruling by\n\nmerely alleging (1) a constitutional violation (2) of clearly\n\nestablished   law   (3)    by   a   public   official   who   either   acted\n\nmaliciously or knew that his actions would deprive the plaintiff of\n\nhis constitutional rights.

First, the Court noted that\n\n\"[t]he resolution of immunity questions inherently requires a\n\nbalance between the evils inevitable in any available alternative.\"\n\nHarlow, 457 U.S. at 813.       The Court also reiterated its concern\n\nthat allowing insubstantial claims against public officials to\n\nproceed to trial exacted costs on society as a whole, \"includ[ing]\n\nthe expenses of litigation, the diversion of official energy from\n\npressing public issues, and the deterrence of able citizens from\n\nacceptance of public office.\"      Harlow, 457 U.S. at 814.      The Harlow\n\nCourt noted that Wood v. Strickland's \"subjective element of the\n\ngood-faith defense frequently has proved incompatible with our\n\nadmonition . . . that insubstantial claims should not proceed to\n\ntrial . . . [because] an official's subjective good faith has been\n\nconsidered to be a question of fact that some courts have regarded\n\nas inherently requiring resolution by jury.\"            Harlow, 457 U.S. at\n\n816.\n\n           Because of the incompatibility of the subjective inquiry\n\nwith the need to dismiss insubstantial cases prior to trial, the\n\nHarlow Court found that \"the dismissal of insubstantial lawsuits\n\nwithout trial--a factor presupposed in the balance of competing\n\n\n                                   -23-\n\finterests struck by our prior cases--requires an adjustment of the\n\n'good faith' standard established by our decisions.\"       Harlow, 457\n\nU.S. at 814-15. This \"adjustment of the 'good faith' standard\" was\n\na reformulation of the third step of the qualified immunity test to\n\neliminate the good-faith, subjective inquiry: \"We therefore hold\n\nthat    government    officials   performing   discretionary   functions\n\ngenerally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as\n\ntheir conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or\n\nconstitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have\n\nknown.\" Harlow, 457 U.S. at 818 (emphasis added).\n\n            Harlow, then, did not affect the first step of the\n\nqualified immunity analysis: whether plaintiff's allegations, if\n\ntrue, establish a constitutional violation. Certain constitutional\n\nviolations, including First Amendment retaliation claims, include\n\ndefendant's motivations as a foundational element of the tort:\n\nMihos's First Amendment retaliation claim \"has no meaning absent\n\nthe allegation of impermissible motivation.\"       Acevedo-Garcia, 204\n\nF.3d at 11.10        While the Supreme Court has removed from the\n\nqualified immunity analysis inquiries into whether a defendant knew\n\nthat he was violating plaintiff's constitutional rights or acted\n\n\n       10\n      The Supreme Court recently explained again that \"[t]he reason\nwhy retaliating against individuals for their speech offends the\nConstitution is that it threatens to inhibit exercise of the\nprotected right. Retaliation is thus akin to an 'unconstitutional\ncondition' demanded for the receipt of a government-provided\nbenefit.\"    Crawford-El v.

While striking down a heightened\n\npleading requirement for motivation-based constitutional torts, the\n\nCrawford-El Court stated that \"a judicial revision of the law to\n\nbar claims that depend on proof of an official's motive\" was not\n\njustified.    Id. at 592.   The Court went on to explain that \"there\n\nis an important distinction between the 'bare allegations of\n\n\n     11\n      Of course, if the constitutional tort itself does not include\na subjective element such as intent, it would be an error to import\nsuch an element into the qualified immunity assessment of whether\nthe plaintiff's allegations, if true, establish a constitutional\nviolation.\n\n                                   -25-\n\fmalice'    that   would   have     provided   the    basis   for     rebutting   a\n\nqualified immunity defense under Wood v.

In contrast, the Court\n\nfound that when assessing intent as an element of a constitutional\n\nviolation, the motivation inquiry is not so broad as to allow\n\ndiscovery on any potential theoretical basis for the cause of\n\ndefendant's alleged animosity towards plaintiff: \"rather, [the\n\nmotivation inquiry] is more specific, such as an intent . . . to\n\ndeter public comment on a specific issue of public importance.\"\n\nId.\n\n            The   Court   then   observed     that    \"existing      law   already\n\nprevents   this   more    narrow    element   of     unconstitutional       motive\n\n[alleged as part of the underlying constitutional tort] from\n\nautomatically carrying a plaintiff to trial.\"                Id.   This is true\n\nbecause a defendant might prevail on a qualified immunity defense\n\nin a case alleging an intent-based constitutional tort, without\n\nneed to inquire as to her motives, if (1) the relevant law was not\n\n\n                                      -26-\n\fclearly established, (2) the plaintiff's speech did not relate to\n\na matter of public concern, or (3) the defendant showed that she\n\nwould have reached the same decision even in the absence of the\n\nemployee's protected speech.    Id. at 592-93.   In consequence, as\n\nnoted by the Crawford-El Court, \"unlike the subjective component of\n\nthe immunity defense eliminated by Harlow, the improper intent\n\nelement of various causes of action should not ordinarily preclude\n\nsummary disposition of insubstantial claims.\"    Id. at 593.\n\n          In Part IV of its opinion in Crawford-El, the Court\n\nrecognized that even though a qualified immunity defense to an\n\nintent-based constitutional tort often can be resolved on grounds\n\nthat avoid inquiries into the government official's motives, that\n\nwill not always be so.   Therefore, the Court found it \"appropriate\n\nto add a few words on some of the existing procedures available to\n\nfederal trial judges in handling claims that involve examination of\n\nan official's state of mind.\"   Id. at 597.   \"First, the court may\n\norder a reply to the defendant's . . . answer under Federal Rule of\n\nCivil Procedure 7(a), or grant the defendant's motion for a more\n\ndefinite statement under Rule 12(e).\"12   Id. at 598.   \"Second, . .\n\n. the district court should resolve [the] threshold question [of\n\n\n     12\n      Fed.

The Court then noted that \"[i]f the plaintiff's action\n\nsurvives    these     initial    hurdles    and   is   otherwise       viable,       the\n\nplaintiff ordinarily will be entitled to some discovery.                        Rule 26\n\nvests the trial judge with broad discretion to tailor discovery\n\nnarrowly and to dictate the sequence of discovery.\"                Id.       The Court\n\ndescribed the ways in which the district court may limit the\n\nnumber,    length,     subject    matter,     time,    place,     and       manner    of\n\ndepositions and interrogatories, as well as various discovery\n\nscenarios      that   would     facilitate     \"the     prompt     and       efficient\n\nresolution of the lawsuit. . . .\"            Id. at 599.    Finally, the Court\n\nobserved that \"[b]eyond these procedures and others that we have\n\nnot mentioned, summary judgment serves as the ultimate screen to\n\nweed out truly insubstantial lawsuits prior to trial.\" Id. at 600.\n\n              With its careful attention to the ways in which trial\n\ncourts can control the examination of an official's state of mind\n\npre-trial, the Supreme Court acknowledged in Crawford-El that the\n\nadoption of an objective standard for qualified immunity in Harlow\n\ndid not foreclose all state of mind inquiries during the pre-trial\n\nconsideration of qualified immunity when state of mind is an\n\n\n\n\n                                      -28-\n\felement of the constitutional tort.13    Swift misreads Harlow in\n\nasserting that its reformulation of the qualified immunity defense\n\nmakes her motivation in firing Mihos irrelevant to the qualified\n\nimmunity analysis.   Therefore, if the qualified immunity defense\n\n\n\n     13\n      When plaintiffs allege an intent-based constitutional tort,\ndefendants asserting qualified immunity often quote the passage in\nCrawford-El stating that \"improper motive is irrelevant on the\nissue of qualified immunity. . . .\" 523 U.S. at 589. In doing so,\nthey take the passage out of context. In this portion of Crawford-\nEl, the Court is explaining how Harlow removed the subjective\nelements from the third step of the qualified immunity inquiry so\nthat \"bare allegations\" that the defendant maliciously or knowingly\nviolated plaintiff's constitutional rights would no longer suffice\nto overcome a qualified immunity defense. As Crawford-El explains\nin the same paragraph, its holding in Harlow \"that 'bare\nallegations of malice' cannot overcome the qualified immunity\ndefense did not implicate the elements of the plaintiff's initial\nburden of proving a constitutional violation,\" which is the first\nstep in the qualified immunity inquiry. As we have explained, the\nrest of the Crawford-El opinion confirms this point.\n     Indeed, in the footnote immediately preceding the statement\nthat \"evidence of improper motive is irrelevant on the issue of\nqualified immunity,\" Crawford-El quotes an opinion of Justice\nGinsburg, when she was a judge on the District of Columbia Circuit,\nand calls it a \"correct understanding of Harlow. . . .\"\n\n          Had the Court [in Harlow] intended its\n          formulation of the qualified immunity defense\n          to foreclose all inquiry into the defendants'\n          state of mind, the Court might have instructed\n          the entry of judgment for defendants Harlow\n          and Butterfield on the constitutional claim\n          without further ado.      In fact, the Court\n          returned the case to the district court in an\n          open-ended   remand,   a   disposition  hardly\n          consistent with a firm intent to delete the\n          state    of    mind   inquiry     from   every\n          constitutional tort calculus.\n\nCrawford-El, 523 U.S. at 589 n.11 (quoting Martin v.

However, as we have previously explained,\n\non a motion to dismiss we must accept as true the allegations in\n\nMihos's complaint about Swift's motivation.                    In the Pickering\n\nbalance, the exercise to which we now return, these allegations\n\nproduce a decisive tilt for Mihos.\n\n            We look first to Mihos’s side of the scale to assess “the\n\ninterests served by [Mihos’s First Amendment activity] – including\n\n[his]    interests       in    communicating,   and    the    interests      of   the\n\ncommunity    in        receiving,    information      on     matters    of   public\n\nimportance. . . .”            O'Connor, 994 F.2d at 915.

Together, Mihos's and the public's interests weigh\n\nheavily on their side of the Pickering balance.\n\n           In turning to Swift's side of the balance, we find almost\n\nnothing because of the posture of this case.                We have already\n\nexplained why the Levy II descriptions of Swift's reasons for\n\nfiring Mihos cannot trump the contrary allegations in Mihos's\n\ncomplaint.        In consequence, the complaint alone sets forth the\n\nfactual allegations that inform our review of this motion to\n\ndismiss.\n\n           In his complaint, Mihos explains that Swift stated in the\n\nFebruary 6, 2002 termination letters that she removed Mihos and\n\nLevy from office principally because their votes were \"fiscally\n\nirresponsible.\"        However,   Mihos's      complaint   then   denies   this\n\ncharge, stating that the motion for which he voted \"was fiscally\n\nsound and in the best interest of the Authority.\"                 Furthermore,\n\nMihos alleged that \"he exercised his best judgment and concluded\n\nthat the January 2002 toll increase was not in the Authority's best\n\ninterests and was not necessary as a matter of law.\"              According to\n\nMihos's complaint, \"Swift was enraged that the Authority failed to\n\n\n                                        -31-\n\fapprove the January 2002 toll increase, which she supported.\"\n\nFurther, Mihos alleged that the actions Swift took against him\n\n\"were in direct retaliation for the votes\" he took regarding the\n\ntolls.    Finally, Mihos alleged that he was \"removed from public\n\noffice before the expiration of his term because of disagreement\n\nwith the way [he] voted on matters of public concern\" and that his\n\ntermination was \"political interference and intimidation.\"              The\n\ndistrict court, and this court on appeal, must accept Mihos's\n\nversion of the dispute.     Accordingly, when considering only the\n\ncomplaint, as we are bound to do, we find a void on Swift's side of\n\nthe scale and the Pickering scale tips decisively in favor of\n\nMihos.\n\n               c.   Substantial Factor\n\n           Having   determined   that    the   Pickering   balance   favors\n\nMihos’s First Amendment rights, we now consider whether his vote\n\nwas a substantial factor in Swift’s decision to fire him.            See Mt.\n\nHealthy City School Dist. Bd. Educ. v. Doyle, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109574\"><a href=\"/opinion/109574/mt-healthy-city-bd-of-ed-v-doyle/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 287\n\n(1977).   This “substantial factor” requirement is wholly distinct\n\nfrom the discussion of “motivation” in the previous section.14\n\n\n     14\n      Many of the qualified immunity cases use the phrases\n“substantial factor” and “motivating factor” interchangeably to\ndescribe the causal relationship between the protected conduct and\nthe adverse action taken against the plaintiff. We prefer to use\nthe phrase “substantial factor” to avoid confusion with the earlier\ndiscussion of motivation, where motivation, rather than referring\nto causation, refers to whether Swift was concerned about\nlegitimate government interests or impermissible retaliation. See\nStella, 63 F.3d at 74-75 (explaining that \"plaintiff must show . .\n\n                                  -32-\n\fHere, the inquiry is whether Mihos’s        termination was attributable\n\nto his exercise of his First Amendment rights or to some other\n\nreason unrelated to his vote.     See id.     In short, the issue is the\n\ncausal   link   between   the   protected    conduct   and   the   adverse\n\nemployment action.    For purposes of her motion to dismiss, Swift\n\ndid not contest that Mihos's vote was the reason for her decision\n\nto remove him from the Turnpike Authority. Again, we pause briefly\n\nto address this issue on the merits.\n\n           Mihos and Levy voted against Swift's wishes regarding the\n\ntoll increases on October 30, 2001.           Seventeen days later, on\n\nNovember 16, Swift informed Mihos and Levy that she was removing\n\nthem from office.    Following Levy I and the termination hearing,\n\nSwift notified Mihos and Levy of her decision to remove them for\n\ncause, stating that the principal cause for their removal was their\n\n\"fiscally irresponsible\" votes on October 30, 2001.            The third\n\nmember of the Turnpike Authority, who proposed the January 2002\n\nincreases and voted against the July 2002 toll increases, never\n\nreceived any such communication. Hence, we agree with the district\n\ncourt that, on these facts, there is no serious dispute that\n\n\n\n\n. that his speech was a substantial or motivating factor for the\nadverse action taken against him . . . and the defendant must then\nprove . . . that the employer would have acted in the same way\ntoward the plaintiff ‘even in the absence of the protected\nconduct.’\"(citing Mt. Healthy, 429 U.S. at 287)(internal citations\nomitted)).\n\n                                  -33-\n\fMihos’s vote on the timing of the toll increases was a substantial\n\nfactor in Swift’s decision to remove him from office.\n\n           Having determined that (1) Mihos's vote involved a matter\n\nof public concern, (2) Mihos's and the public's interest are more\n\nweighty on the Pickering scale than Swift's, and (3) Mihos's vote\n\nwas a substantial factor in Swift's decision to fire him, we\n\nconclude that Mihos has alleged a violation of his First Amendment\n\nrights.\n\n           2.    Clearly Established Right\n\n           We now turn to whether Mihos's First Amendment right in\n\nthis case was clearly established at the time Swift decided to\n\nremove him from the Turnpike Authority.\n\n           The   level   of   abstractness    at   which   the   \"right\"   in\n\nquestion is articulated can often determine the outcome of this\n\ninquiry.

Additionally, the \"inquiry into whether the\n\nright is clearly established 'must be undertaken in light of the\n\n\n\n\n                                   -34-\n\fspecific context of the case, not as a broad general proposition.'\"\n\nSuboh, 298 F.3d at 93.\n\n           With this guidance in mind, we articulate the First\n\nAmendment right at stake here as the right of a public official to\n\nvote on a matter of public concern properly before his agency\n\nwithout suffering retaliation from the appointing authority for\n\nreasons unrelated to legitimate governmental interests.           We have\n\napplied a similar formulation before: \"[a]lthough we have found no\n\ncases   directly   on   point,   probably   because   it   is   considered\n\nunassailable, we have no difficulty finding that the act of voting\n\non public issues by a member of a public agency or board comes\n\nwithin the freedom of speech guarantee of the first amendment. . .\n\n.   There can be no more definite expression of opinion than by\n\nvoting on a controversial public issue.\"        Miller v.

We reiterated six years later\n\nthat this right was clearly established:       \"Voting by members of .\n\n. . boards, commissions, and authorities comes within the heartland\n\nof First Amendment doctrine, and the status of public officials'\n\nvotes as constitutionally protected speech [is] established beyond\n\nperadventure of doubt. . . .\" Stella v. Kelley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196256\"><a href=\"/opinion/196256/stella-v-kelley/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 75 (1st\n\nCir. 1995).\n\n           Notwithstanding Stella and Miller, Swift urges that \"a\n\nbalancing test, by its indeterminate nature, makes it highly\n\nunlikely that a public employer, in such circumstances, could be\n\n\n                                   -35-\n\fheld to have violated a clearly established right.\"         In support of\n\nthis proposition, Swift refers to Frazier v. Bailey, quoted by the\n\ndistrict court in Mihos II, holding that when a right is \"subject\n\nto a balancing test, the right can rarely be considered 'clearly\n\nestablished,' at least in the absence of closely corresponding\n\nfactual and legal precedent.\" </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578605\"><a href=\"/opinion/578605/kevin-frazier-v-edward-n-bailey/\"><span class=\"volume\">957</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">920</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 931 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\nHere, though, Miller and Stella provide the \"closely corresponding\n\nfactual and legal precedents\" that would have served to inform a\n\npublic official that Mihos's First Amendment right was clearly\n\nestablished.15\n\n            As Swift acknowledges in her brief, both cases involve\n\nvotes by public officials on matters of public concern and their\n\nsubsequent removal based on those votes.         Swift seeks to downplay\n\ntheir import by emphasizing that Miller and Stella neither applied\n\nthe Pickering balancing test nor addressed \"the limits of the\n\n'right to    vote'   where   the   removing   official   states   that   the\n\nconsequences of the decision rendered by the 'vote' will harm the\n\npublic interest.\"\n\n            Once again, Swift is hampered by the procedural posture\n\nof this case.    Her stated belief that the consequences of Mihos's\n\nvote will harm the public interest cannot trump Mihos's claim of a\n\n\n\n     15\n      Whether a reasonable person in Swift's position would have\nknown that her actions violated that clearly established right is\na different question.    We address that question in the next\nsection.\n\n                                    -36-\n\fpolitically retaliatory motive. As we have explained at length, on\n\na motion to dismiss the factual allegations in the complaint\n\ncontrol.     Hence, Swift's defense of her action cannot serve to\n\ndistinguish Stella and Miller any more than it can weigh on her\n\nside of the Pickering scale.\n\n            3.   The Understanding of a Reasonable Official\n\n            The third step in the qualified immunity analysis, which\n\nembodies the objective standard announced in Harlow, requires us to\n\nanalyze    \"whether   an        objectively     reasonable   officer   in    the\n\ndefendant's position would have understood [her] action to violate\n\nthe plaintiff's rights.\"           Suboh, 298 F.3d 95.        Given the facts\n\nalleged in the complaint, as described in Part I.A. supra, we have\n\nno trouble finding that a reasonable official similarly situated to\n\nSwift would have known that terminating Mihos for his vote violated\n\nhis constitutional rights. Taking the allegations in the complaint\n\nas true, Mihos exercised his best judgment as to the proper course\n\nof action, cast his vote, and was fired in retaliation for that\n\nvote for reasons unrelated to legitimate governmental interests.\n\nNo reasonable public official could have failed to realize that a\n\nmember of a public instrumentality cannot be terminated on such\n\ngrounds    for   voting    on    matters   of    public   concern   within   his\n\nauthority.\n\n            Having found that (1) Mihos's allegations, if true,\n\nestablish a violation of his First Amendment rights, (2) the right\n\n\n                                       -37-\n\fwas clearly established at the time Swift fired him, and (3) a\n\nreasonable public official would have known that the discharge\n\nconstituted a constitutional violation, we find that Swift is not\n\nentitled to qualified immunity.16\n\n                               III.\n\n          For the reasons explained above, we affirm the district\n\ncourt's denial of the motion to dismiss in Mihos I, vacate the\n\ndeclaratory judgment and the denial of damages in Mihos II, and\n\nremand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n          SO ORDERED.\n\n\n\n\n     16\n      Of course, this ruling does not preclude Swift from asserting\nqualified immunity in a subsequent motion for summary judgment or\nat trial.

Rivera-Cruz </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"728080\"><a href=\"/opinion/728080/hector-guzmn-rivera-v-hector-rivera-cruz/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">664</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 669 (1st\nCir. 1996)(holding that the \"defense of qualified immunity may be\nraised and appealed at multiple stages of the trial. . . .\").\nHowever, if the trial court denies the request for summary judgment\nbecause of a genuine issue as to any material fact, including\nmotive, that ruling would not permit an interlocutory appeal. See,\ne.g., Stella, 63 F.3d at 74 (holding that \"a district court's pre-\ntrial rejection of a qualified immunity defense is not immediately\nappealable to the extent that it turns on either an issue of fact\nor an issue perceived by the trial court to be an issue of fact.\").\n\n                               -38-\n\f</pre>",
