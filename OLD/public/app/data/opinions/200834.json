Rieckehoff, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom H.S. García, United States Attorney, and Sonia I. Torres-\nPabón, Assistant United States Attorney, Chief, Criminal Division,\nwere on brief for appellee.\n\n\n                           January 28, 2004\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f              BOUDIN, Chief Judge.    In 1995, José Tapia-Escalera pled\n\nguilty   to    possessing   a   kilogram   of   cocaine   with   intent   to\n\ndistribute.      21 U.S.C. § 841 (2000).        He was sentenced to five\n\nyears of imprisonment followed by five years of supervised release.\n\nTapia was released after his term of imprisonment but in January\n\n2000, he violated the terms of his supervised release and, after a\n\nrevocation hearing, was sentenced to ten months in prison for the\n\nviolation and four years of supervised release following this new\n\nterm.\n\n              In October 2002, the Probation Office notified the court\n\nby motion that Tapia had again violated the conditions of his\n\nsupervised release by failing to report to the probation officer\n\nand failing to notify the office of his change of address.                In\n\nDecember 2002, the district court conducted a revocation hearing.\n\nAs soon as the district judge stated the charges, Tapia's counsel\n\nsaid:\n\n                     First, the Court should know that Mr.\n              Tapia is not going to contest the allegations,\n              the violation of failing to report to the\n              probation officers as directed and failing to\n              notify a change of address within 72 hours.\n              That is accepted.\n\n                     I've also asked him if it's, in fact,\n              true that he admitted to the probation office\n              that he was using heroin, which he has\n              accepted, and we will not then contest that\n              either.\n\n              Defense counsel then proposed a period of five to eleven\n\nmonths of home detention with electronic monitoring. After finding\n\n                                     -2-\n\fthat the violations had occurred, the district judge rejected this\n\nsuggestion, saying that this was the second time Tapia had violated\n\nrelease conditions.      The judge imposed a new term of 30 months'\n\nimprisonment (but no further term of supervised release following\n\nthis imprisonment).   This sentence exceeded the period--apparently\n\nfive to eleven months--recommended by the Sentencing Commission's\n\ntable, U.S.S.G. § 7B1.4 (2002); but this table is an \"advisory\"\n\npolicy statement rather than a formal guideline.       U.S.S.G. ch. 7,\n\npt.   A   introductory    cmt.   3(a)     (2002);   United   States   v.\n\nRamirez-Rivera, 241 F.3d 37, 40 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n          On this appeal, Tapia does not challenge the district\n\njudge's deviation from the guidelines' suggested range.        Instead,\n\nTapia first argues that the finding of liability cannot stand\n\nbecause there was no admission by Tapia personally, no independent\n\nevidence of his violations, and no proper waiver of his right to a\n\nhearing to contest the charges.         Tapia then claims that the 30-\n\nmonth term of imprisonment violated a statutory cap governing\n\nmaximum penalties for violating conditions of release, 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3583(e)(3) (2000).\n\n           None of these claims were raised in the district court.\n\nAccordingly, one might expect the government to argue that the\n\nplain error standard had to be met on appeal, but it has not done\n\nso.   Anyway, the attacks on liability fail whether reviewed under\n\nthe plain error standard or ordinary standards of review.        As for\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fthe statutory cap issue, we think there is an error which might or\n\nmight not be treated as plain under United States v. Olano, 507\n\nU.S. 725, 732-36 (1993); but since the plain error issue is itself\n\ncomplicated and the government has not argued for applying the\n\nOlano test, we consider the statutory cap issue on the merits.\n\n           We start with the challenge to the district court's\n\nfinding that Tapia violated conditions of his release.               After\n\nTapia's arrest,   he   was   brought    before   a   magistrate   judge   on\n\nNovember 20, 2002, for a preliminary hearing to establish probable\n\ncause.1   The government relied on the Probation Office's report,\n\nand Tapia's counsel reserved his defense.            The magistrate judge\n\nthen advised Tapia and his counsel that Tapia would be held for the\n\nrevocation hearing, adding:\n\n                  [Tapia] is entitled to bring his own\n           witnesses and to challenge any evidence the\n           Government presents as well as to cross\n           examine any Government witness or bring his\n           own evidence to show that the violation[s]\n           were not committed.\n\n                  My instruction to the Probation Office\n           is that the Defendant is to be provided with\n           the discovery available to sustain the\n           allegation or the representations made in the\n           motion for revocation of condition of release.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      At the time of the arrest and preliminary hearing, the rules\ngoverning such proceedings were set forth in an earlier version of\nFed. R. Crim. P. 32.1; one day before the December 2, 2002, hearing\non the merits, a recodified version of the rules took effect but\nthe changes do not affect our decision.\n\n                                  -4-\n\f            At the revocation hearing held on December 2, 2002,\n\nTapia's counsel intervened as soon as the judge explained that\n\nTapia had    been   ordered   arrested   because   of   his   violation   of\n\nconditions of release and had allegedly admitted that he was using\n\nheroin.   Counsel then made the statement quoted earlier explaining\n\nthat Tapia was not going to contest the failure to report and\n\nnotify allegations and that Tapia had also \"accepted\" the truth of\n\nthe charge that he had been using heroin.          Counsel then launched\n\nimmediately into his proposal for home detention.\n\n            Thereafter, in the arguments about the proper penalty,\n\nTapia's violations were taken for granted and the district judge\n\ndid no more than make a formal finding to that effect when he\n\nannounced the penalty.        At no point did the judge ask Tapia\n\npersonally whether he committed the violations or whether he waived\n\nhis right to have evidence presented on this subject; and the\n\ngovernment neither presented nor described any independent evidence\n\nof the violations.     All this, says Tapia, rendered the finding of\n\nviolations improper.\n\n            This would certainly be so if the proceeding were one\n\nunder Rule 11 for the taking of a plea of guilty,2 but the\n\n\n\n     2\n      Among other detailed prescriptions for guilty pleas, the\n\"court must address the defendant personally in open court\" to\nensure that the plea is voluntary, Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(b)(2); must\nadvise the defendant of a whole litany of rights, Fed. R. Crim. P.\n11(b)(1)(A)-(N); and in addition \"the court must determine that\nthere is a factual basis for the plea,\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(b)(3).\n\n                                   -5-\n\frevocation    proceeding   is   of   a   more    informal    character.   The\n\nprincipal requirements laid down by Rule 32.1 for the merits\n\nhearing are notice of the alleged violation, right to counsel, an\n\nopportunity to appear and present evidence and a (qualified) right\n\non request to question adverse witnesses.                   Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n32.1(b)(2)(A)-(D).     Tapia was advised of these rights at his\n\npreliminary hearing, he had counsel, and he makes no claim that the\n\ncharges were unknown to him.\n\n             Nevertheless, this court has insisted that before the\n\ndefendant forgoes the opportunity in a revocation case to contest\n\nthe charges, the defendant must understand his procedural rights\n\nand choose not to exercise them.           United States v. Correa-Torres,\n\n326 F.3d 18, 22-23 (1st Cir. 2003).             Correa-Torres stressed that\n\nthere is no talismanic formula; the judgment depends both on what\n\nthe defendant was told and upon \"the totality of the attendant\n\ncircumstances.\"      Id. at 23.          The court there was especially\n\nconcerned because the defendant himself expressed some disagreement\n\nwith the truth of the charges, yet no evidence was taken or formal\n\nwaiver secured.    Id. at 24.\n\n          It would have simplified matters if the district court\n\nhad addressed Tapia, asked him whether he understood and admitted\n\nto the charges, and obtained his personal acquiescence.                   But,\n\ntaking account of \"the attendant circumstances,\" we are satisfied\n\nfor the reasons discussed below that Tapia did understand the\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fcharges, knew he could contest them, and chose not to do so.                    In\n\naddition,    it    appears      that   there    was   ample   evidence     of   the\n\nviolations, which needed only be shown by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence, 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e)(3) (2000).\n\n            The motion by the Probation Office that started the\n\nproceeding was precise as to dates and details.               It said that Tapia\n\nhad failed to report as required, or to call to excuse his absence,\n\non two specific dates: June 25 and August 7, 2002.                    It also said\n\nthat during a home visit on August 15, 2002, family members had\n\nadmitted that Tapia had not returned home since August 7, 2002, and\n\nthat he \"has been using controlled substances.\"\n\n            Thus, the detailed charges were known, Tapia was told of\n\nhis procedural rights at the preliminary hearing, defense counsel\n\nmade clear in Tapia's presence that Tapia did not contest the\n\ncharges and had admitted drug use, and Tapia made no protest that\n\nany of this was unclear or inaccurate.                Further, Tapia was not a\n\nnovice.     In addition to his prior criminal history, he had been\n\nthrough a guilty plea proceeding in this very case and had even\n\nbeen through a revocation proceeding for his first violation of\n\nrelease conditions.\n\n            Even   now,    nothing     affirmatively       suggests    that   Tapia\n\nmisunderstood his options or that he had any defense to the charges\n\nagainst   him.      He    did    not   move    in   the   district    court   after\n\nsentencing to challenge the finding of violations, just the length\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fof the sentence.     Nor has he identified on appeal anything that he\n\nmisunderstood or might reasonably have misunderstood.             And he has\n\nnever suggested that he had a defense to any of the charges.            Under\n\nthese circumstances we decline to disturb the finding of liability.\n\n             Turning now to the sentence, Tapia contests the term of\n\nimprisonment--30 months--on two related grounds: first, that the\n\nproper statutory cap on his sentence was 24 months and, second,\n\nthat the statute imposing the cap requires that the 10 months Tapia\n\npreviously served for the violations in 2000 be subtracted from the\n\nmaximum (which, depending on how we resolve the first issue, is\n\neither 24 or 36 months). The first claim is wrong--Tapia's counsel\n\nappeared to retreat from it at oral argument--but the second we\n\naccept by a very close margin.\n\n             Starting    as   always     with   the   statutory     language,\n\nSpookyworld, Inc. v. Town of Berlin (In re Spookyworld, Inc.), 346\n\nF.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2003), the main provision at issue is 18 U.S.C.\n\n§     3583(e)(3)   (2000),    which     authorizes    re-imprisonment      for\n\nviolations of supervised release conditions and fixes caps on the\n\npossible new terms of imprisonment.          It was originally enacted in\n\n1987 but was modestly modified and reenacted in full as part of a\n\nset    of   amendments   in   1994.     Violent   Crime   Control    and   Law\n\nEnforcement Act of 1994, Pub. L. No. 103-322, Sec. 110505, §\n\n3583(e)(3), 108 Stat. 1796, 2016-17 (1994). At the time of Tapia's\n\n\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fcrime and later violations, this section said in pertinent part\n\nthat if a defendant violates conditions of release, the court may\n\n          revoke a term of supervised release, and\n          require the defendant to serve in prison all\n          or part of the term of supervised release\n          authorized by statute for the offense that\n          resulted in such term of supervised release\n          without credit for time previously served on\n          postrelease supervision . . . except that a\n          defendant whose terms is revoked under this\n          paragraph may not be required to serve more\n          than 5 years in prison if the offense that\n          resulted in the term of supervised release is\n          a class A felony, more than 3 years in prison\n          if such offense is a class B felony, more than\n          2 years in prison if such offense is a class C\n          or D felony . . . .\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3583(e)(3) (2000).\n\n          Since Tapia's original drug offense carried a forty-year\n\nmaximum it is a class B felony, see 18 U.S.C. § 3559(a)(2) (2000),\n\nand so the three-year cap for revocation applies to Tapia. Tapia's\n\ncounsel argued in his brief that the cap should be the two-year cap\n\nfor a class C felony because the district judge found that Tapia's\n\nviolation was only a grade C offense; but the district judge was\n\nthere referring to the Commission's classification scheme used to\n\nfix a recommended sentence range for the violation of conditions,\n\nU.S.S.G. § 7B1.4 (2002); this is a different scheme used for a\n\ndifferent purpose.3\n\n\n     3\n      The Commission's scheme grades supervised release violations\nfrom A through C based on criteria set forth in U.S.S.G. § 7B1.1.\nThis scheme has no direct connection to the felony classification\nscheme invoked by subsection (e)(3), which is based on criteria set\nforth in 18 U.S.C. § 3559(a).\n\n                                 -9-\n\f            By contrast the cap for maximum reimprisonment is a\n\nbinding cap fixed by the statute and is keyed not to the violation\n\nof conditions but to \"the term of supervised release authorized by\n\nstatute for the offense that resulted in such term of supervised\n\nrelease.\"    18 U.S.C. § 3583(e)(3).     Although slightly confusing\n\nwhere a second violation of conditions occurs, this language\n\nnecessarily refers back to the original offense of conviction,\n\nwhich is the place where there is a \"term of supervised release\n\nauthorized by statute\" for a particular offense,        e.g., 21 U.S.C.\n\n§ 841 (2000) (fixing a four-year minimum for Tapia's original\n\noffense).\n\n            The question how to apply the cap is much more difficult.\n\nThe government says that the three-year cap applies afresh to the\n\n30-month sentence imposed on Tapia in 2002, so that sentence was\n\nwithin the 36-month maximum.    Tapia argues that the cap applies to\n\nthe aggregate of all time imposed for violating supervised release\n\nconditions growing out of the original criminal conviction; if so,\n\nthen   Tapia--having   served   10   months   for   supervised   release\n\nviolations in 2000--could now be sentenced to only 26 months (36\n\nmonths minus 10 months) for the latest violations.\n\n            If one looks only to the bare language of subsection\n\n(e)(3) quoted above, the most straightforward reading favors the\n\ngovernment's position. The three-year cap is described as applying\n\nwherever the defendant is found to have violated conditions of\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fsupervised release.     18 U.S.C. § 3583(e)(3).          Nothing in the\n\nstatute's language says explicitly that in calculating the cap for\n\nthe second term, the first term is to be subtracted from the three-\n\nyear maximum.\n\n            The language of the second sentence of subsection (h)\n\nbolsters the government's reading of subsection (e)(3). Subsection\n\n(h) imposes a cap of its own on the supervised release term that\n\ncan be imposed after a defendant is incarcerated for violating\n\nrelease conditions.4     And   this   cap   explicitly   incorporates   a\n\n\"subtraction\" principle: the \"less any term\" language means that\n\nwhatever new term of supervised release could otherwise be imposed\n\nmust be reduced by the term or terms of imprisonment previously\n\nserved for violating supervised release.       Still, the inference in\n\nthe government's favor is somewhat tempered because (h) was not\n\ndrafted until well after the original (e)(3).\n\n            Nor does the government's reading create a cruel or\n\nsenseless   result.    True,   a   defendant   might   serve   successive\n\nsubstantial terms for supervised release violations for the same\n\n\n\n     4\n      \"When a term of supervised release is revoked and the\ndefendant is required to serve a term of imprisonment that is less\nthan the maximum term of imprisonment authorized under subsection\n(e)(3), the court may include a requirement that the defendant be\nplaced on a term of supervised release after imprisonment. The\nlength of such a term of supervised release shall not exceed the\nterm of supervised release authorized by statute for the offense\nthat resulted in the original term of supervised release, less any\nterm of imprisonment that was imposed upon revocation of supervised\nrelease.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3583(h) (2000).\n\n                                   -11-\n\foriginal crime; but each one would be for a new supervised release\n\nviolation. Further, if prior terms had to be aggregated, then when\n\nthe maximum cap figure had been served the defendant could violate\n\nminor conditions with impunity.                By contrast, subsection (h)'s own\n\naggregation requirement usually prevents indefinite re-imprisonment\n\nbecause eventually          no   new    term    of     supervised    release     can    be\n\nimposed.5\n\n             So far the case for the government looks strong.                          But\n\nnote that reading the statute Tapia's way is not flatly contrary to\n\nsubsection (e)(3)'s language, as it might be if that subsection\n\naffirmatively said that the three-year cap should be applied\n\nwithout subtraction of any term of imprisonment served for a prior\n\nviolation of release conditions.                 Indeed, subsection (e)(3) does\n\nprovide     that   the    amount    of    imprisonment       is    to    be   calculated\n\n\"without     credit      for     time    previously       served    on    post-release\n\nsupervision\" but it makes no mention of denying credit for time\n\nalready     served     on      post-release      imprisonment.           18    U.S.C.    §\n\n3583(e)(3) (2000).\n\n             Even so it is surprising that the best legislative\n\nhistory available as to subsection (e)(3) squarely supports Tapia's\n\nreading     of   the   statute.          The    1991    Senate     Report     discussing\n\n\n     5\n      The exception may be cases where the supervised release\nauthorized by statute is life--as, apparently, is the case for the\nstatute under which Tapia was convicted. 21 U.S.C. § 841 (2000);\nsee United States v. Cortes-Claudio, 312 F.3d 17, 22-23 (1st Cir.\n2002).\n\n                                          -12-\n\fvirtually the same language adopted in 1994 makes clear that the\n\ncap is to apply to the aggregate term of all imprisonments for\n\nrelease condition violations.6    The report contains a precise\n\nexample to this effect:\n\n          For example, in the case of a Class C felony\n          for which the maximum supervised release term\n          is three years, a defendant who is revoked and\n          re-imprisoned for 18 months could be ordered\n          to serve as much as 18 additional months on\n          supervised release (36-month maximum term of\n          supervised release - 18 months imprisonment =\n          18 months possible re-release supervision).\n          If the same defendant was again revoked, he\n          could be re-imprisoned for not exceeding six\n          months    (24-month    cap    -   18    months\n          previously-served imprisonment = 6 months\n          allowable imprisonment) and if so imprisoned,\n          could not thereafter be placed on supervision\n          (because the two-year imprisonment cap would\n          have   been   reached).    Thus,  under   [the\n          amendments], a defendant would always be\n          credited for incarceration time against both\n          the cap on re-imprisonment and the maximum\n          authorized period of supervised release.\n\n137 Cong. Rec. S7772 (daily ed. June 13, 1991) (emphasis added).\n\n          Just as the \"plain meaning\" of statutes is a matter of\n\ndegree, so legislative history is not all of a piece.      Here, the\n\nSenate Report is no chance remark in a hearing or on the floor but\n\nis a full-scale explanation of the bill in detail, and it is\n\nclarity itself on the point at issue.   Arguably, the author of the\n\nreport misread subsection (e)(3), a technical provision that was\n\n\n     6\n      The amendments were not actually passed until three years\nlater as part of the omnibus Violent Crime Control and Law\nEnforcement Act of 1994, Pub. L. No. 103-322, 108 Stat. 1796\n(1994), but the differences are only minor.\n\n                              -13-\n\fnot   the   main    focus     of   legislative    attention     in   1994;   but\n\nnevertheless this was the gloss Congress had before it when it\n\nreenacted the subsection.\n\n            In   all    events,    perhaps   prompted   by    the    legislative\n\nhistory, the government conceded in several prior circuit cases\n\nthat the imprisonment cap should be reduced by revocation terms\n\nalready served.        Five circuits have now adopted Tapia's reading of\n\nthe   statute,     although    all   were    in   dicta,     after   government\n\nconcessions, or both.7       Among them, only the Fifth Circuit followed\n\nthis course \"dubitante,\" pointing out (as we have done above) that\n\nthe statutory language taken alone favors the government.                United\n\nStates v. Jackson, 329 F.3d 406, 408 n.7 (5th Cir. 2003).\n\n            In our own case, the U.S. Attorney's office, reading the\n\nstatute afresh, urges us to follow the language and disregard the\n\nlegislative history.          Although this is a very close call, we\n\ndecline to do so.        As already noted, the statute's language does\n\nnot strictly forbid the interpolated limitation sought by Tapia;\n\nthis result is endorsed by unusually explicit legislative history;\n\n\n\n      7\n      United States v. Jackson, 329 F.3d 406, 407-08 & n.7 (5th\nCir. 2003) (accepting government concession but expressing doubt as\nto its soundness); United States v. Swenson, 289 F.3d 676, 677\n(10th Cir. 2002) (government conceded point); United States v.\nMerced, 263 F.3d 34, 37-38 (2d Cir. 2001) (government conceded\npoint); United States v. Brings Plenty, 188 F.3d 1051, 1054 (8th\nCir.1999) (in dictum accepting government concession); United\nStates v. Beals, 87 F.3d 854, 857-58 (7th Cir. 1996) (in dictum),\noverruled on other grounds by United States v. Withers, 128 F.3d\n1167, 1172 (7th Cir. 1997).\n\n                                      -14-\n\fit has been several times conceded by the government; and five\n\ncircuits have now followed the government's original concessions.\n\nTo the extent that we are left with any uncertainty after these\n\nconsiderations, the rule of lenity applies to tip the balance in\n\nthe defendant's favor.       See, e.g., United States v. Luna-Diaz, 222\n\nF.3d 1, 3 n.2 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n            The outcome does not threaten much harm.            A three-year\n\ncap even in the aggregate would normally suffice to punish even a\n\nsuccession of petty supervised release violations like failing to\n\nreport. Where the violation is more serious (such as drugs), it is\n\nindependently a crime and can be independently prosecuted in a\n\ncriminal case.      And, if a new Congress disliked the result spelled\n\nout   in   the    1991   legislative    history,   it   could   easily   amend\n\nsubsection (e)(3).\n\n            It turns out, although neither side mentioned the point,\n\nthat Congress has altered the statute to adopt the government's\n\nposition for the future.       The 2003 PROTECT Act adds to subsection\n\n(e)(3) the phrase \"on any such revocation\" so that the statute now\n\nreads \"a defendant whose term is revoked under this paragraph may\n\nnot be required to serve on any such revocation more than 5 years\n\nif . . . .\"      PROTECT Act, Pub. L. No. 108-21, tit. I, § 101(1), 117\n\nStat. 650, 651 (2003).         The intent of the 2003 Congress cannot\n\nalter the law as enacted in 1994, but reading the 1994 statute in\n\nTapia's favor has only limited consequences.\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\f           The 2003 amendment does not apply in this case, Tapia\n\nhaving   committed   the   original   offense   (as   well   as   the   new\n\nviolations) before the latest amendment.        Cf. Johnson v. United\n\nStates, 529 U.S. 694, 701-02 (2000).     Nothing in the new statute as\n\nit concerns § 3583(e)(3) suggests an effort to apply this amendment\n\nretroactively and, of course, the government has not relied upon\n\nthe new amendment at all.        Under the circumstances, the 1994\n\nlanguage as we have construed it governs the remand.\n\n           The judgment adjudicating violation of conditions of\n\nrelease is affirmed but the term of imprisonment must be reduced\n\nfrom 30 to 26 months and the matter is remanded for this purpose.\n\n           It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\f",

He was sentenced to five years of imprisonment followed by five years of supervised release. Tapia was released after his term of imprisonment but in January 2000, he violated the terms of his supervised release and, after a revocation hearing, was sentenced to ten months in prison for the violation and four years of supervised release following this new term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 2002, the Probation Office notified the court by motion that Tapia had again violated the conditions of his supervised release by failing to report to the probation officer and failing to notify the office of his change of address. In December 2002, the district court conducted a revocation hearing. As soon as the district judge stated the charges, Tapia's counsel said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the Court should know that Mr. Tapia is not going to contest the allegations, the violation of failing to report to the probation officers as directed and failing to notify a change of address within 72 hours. That is accepted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I've also asked him if it's, in fact, true that he admitted to the probation office that he was using heroin, which he has accepted, and we will not then contest that either.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defense counsel then proposed a period of five to eleven months of home detention with electronic monitoring. After finding that the violations had occurred, the district judge rejected this suggestion, saying that this was the second time Tapia had violated release conditions. The judge imposed a new term of 30 months' imprisonment (but no further term of supervised release following this imprisonment). This sentence exceeded the period &#8212; apparently five to eleven months &#8212; recommended by the Sentencing Commission's table, U.S.S.G. &#167; 7B1.4 (2002); but this table is an \"advisory\" policy statement rather than a formal guideline. U.S.S.G. ch. 7, pt. A introductory cmt. 3(a) (2002); <i>United States v. Ramirez-Rivera,</i> 241 F.3d 37, 40 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal, Tapia does not challenge the district judge's deviation from the guidelines' suggested range. Instead, Tapia first argues that the finding of liability cannot stand because there was no admission by Tapia personally, no independent evidence of his violations, and no proper waiver of his right to a hearing to contest the charges. Tapia then claims that the 30-month term of imprisonment violated a statutory cap governing maximum penalties for violating conditions of release, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(e)(3) (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">None of these claims were raised in the district court. Accordingly, one might expect the government to argue that the plain error standard had to be met on appeal, but it has not done so. Anyway, the attacks on liability fail whether reviewed under the plain error standard or ordinary standards of review. As for the statutory cap issue, we think there is an error which might or might not be treated as plain under <i>United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 732-36, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); but since the plain error issue is itself complicated and the government has not argued for applying the <i>Olano</i> test, we consider the statutory cap issue on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the challenge to the district court's finding that Tapia violated conditions of his release. After Tapia's arrest, he was brought before a magistrate judge on November 20, 2002, for a preliminary hearing to establish probable cause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The government relied on the Probation Office's report, and Tapia's counsel reserved his defense. The magistrate judge then advised Tapia and his counsel that Tapia would be held for the revocation hearing, adding:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Tapia] is entitled to bring his own witnesses and to challenge any evidence the Government presents as well as to cross examine any Government witness or bring his own evidence to show that the violation[s] were not committed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My instruction to the Probation Office is that the Defendant is to be provided with the discovery available to sustain the allegation or the representations made in the motion for revocation of condition of release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the revocation hearing held on December 2, 2002, Tapia's counsel intervened as soon as the judge explained that Tapia had been ordered arrested because of his violation of conditions of release and had allegedly admitted that he was using heroin. Counsel then made the statement quoted earlier explaining that Tapia was not going to contest the failure to report and notify allegations and that Tapia had also \"accepted\" the truth of the charge that he had been using heroin. Counsel then launched immediately into his proposal for home detention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, in the arguments about the proper penalty, Tapia's violations were taken for granted and the district judge did no more than make a formal finding to that effect when he announced the penalty. At no point did the judge ask Tapia personally whether he committed the violations or whether he waived his right to have evidence presented on this subject; and the government neither presented nor described any independent evidence of the violations. All this, says Tapia, rendered the finding of violations improper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This would certainly be so if the proceeding were one under Rule 11 for the taking of a plea of guilty,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> but the revocation proceeding is of a more informal character. The principal requirements laid down by Rule 32.1 for the merits hearing are notice of the alleged violation, right to counsel, an opportunity to appear and present evidence and a (qualified) right on request to question adverse witnesses. Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.1(b)(2)(A)-(D). Tapia was advised of these rights at his preliminary hearing, he had counsel, and he makes no claim that the charges were unknown to him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, this court has insisted that before the defendant forgoes the opportunity in a revocation case to contest the charges, the defendant must understand his procedural rights and choose not to exercise them. <i>United States v. Correa-Torres,</i> 326 F.3d 18, 22-23 (1st Cir. 2003). <i>Correa-Torres</i> stressed that there is no talismanic formula; the judgment depends both on what the defendant was told and upon \"the totality of the attendant circumstances.\" <i>Id.</i> at 23. The court there was especially concerned because the defendant himself expressed some disagreement with the truth of the charges, yet no evidence was taken or formal waiver secured. <i>Id.</i> at 24.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It would have simplified matters if the district court had addressed Tapia, asked him whether he understood and admitted to the charges, and obtained his personal acquiescence. But, taking account of \"the attendant circumstances,\" we are satisfied for the reasons discussed below that Tapia did understand the charges, knew he could contest them, and chose not to do so. In addition, it appears that there was ample evidence of the violations, which needed only be shown by a preponderance of the evidence, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(e)(3) (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The motion by the Probation Office that started the proceeding was precise as to dates and details. It said that Tapia had failed to report as required, or to call to excuse his absence, on two specific dates: June 25 and August 7, 2002. It also said that during a home visit on August 15, 2002, family members had admitted that Tapia had not returned home since August 7, 2002, and that he \"has been using controlled substances.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the detailed charges were known, Tapia was told of his procedural rights at the preliminary hearing, defense counsel made clear in Tapia's presence that Tapia did not contest the charges and had admitted drug use, and Tapia made no protest that any of this was unclear or inaccurate. Further, Tapia was not a novice. In addition to his prior criminal history, he had been through a guilty plea proceeding in this very case and had even been through a revocation proceeding for his first violation of release conditions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even now, nothing affirmatively suggests that Tapia misunderstood his options or that he had any defense to the charges against him. He did not move in the district court after sentencing to challenge the finding of violations, just the length of the sentence. Nor has he identified on appeal anything that he misunderstood or might reasonably have misunderstood. And he has never suggested that he had a defense to any of the charges. Under these circumstances we decline to disturb the finding of liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning now to the sentence, Tapia contests the term of imprisonment &#8212; 30 months &#8212; on two related grounds: first, that the proper statutory cap on his sentence was 24 months and, second, that the statute imposing the cap requires that the 10 months Tapia previously served for the violations in 2000 be subtracted from the maximum (which, depending on how we resolve the first issue, is either 24 or 36 months). The first claim is wrong &#8212; Tapia's counsel appeared to retreat from it at oral argument &#8212; but the second we accept by a very close margin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Starting as always with the statutory language, <i>Spookyworld, Inc. v. Town of Berlin</i> (<i>In re Spookyworld, Inc.</i>), 346 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.2003), the main provision at issue is 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(e)(3) (2000), which authorizes re-imprisonment for violations of supervised release conditions and fixes caps on the possible new terms of imprisonment. It was originally enacted in 1987 but was modestly modified and reenacted in full as part of a set of amendments in 1994. Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Pub.L. No. 103-322, Sec. 110505, &#167; 3583(e)(3), 108 Stat. 1796, 2016-17 (1994). At the time of Tapia's crime and later violations, this section said in pertinent part that if a defendant violates conditions of release, the court may</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">revoke a term of supervised release, and require the defendant to serve in prison all or part of the term of supervised release authorized by statute for the offense that resulted in such term of supervised release without credit for time previously served on postrelease supervision ... except that a defendant whose terms is revoked under this paragraph may not be required to serve more than 5 years in prison if the offense that resulted in the term of supervised release is a class A felony, more than 3 years in prison if such offense is a class B felony, more than 2 years in prison if such offense is a class C or D felony....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(e)(3) (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since Tapia's original drug offense carried a forty-year maximum it is a class B felony, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3559(a)(2) (2000), and so the three-year cap for revocation applies to Tapia. Tapia's counsel argued in his brief that the cap should be the two-year cap for a class C felony because the district judge found that Tapia's violation was only a grade C offense; but the district judge was there referring to the Commission's classification scheme used to fix a recommended sentence range for the <i>violation of conditions,</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 7B1.4 (2002); this is a different scheme used for a different purpose.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By contrast the cap for <i>maximum reimprisonment</i> is a <i>binding</i> cap fixed by the statute and is keyed not to the violation of conditions but to \"the term of supervised release authorized by statute for the offense that resulted in such term of supervised release.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(e)(3). Although slightly confusing where a second violation of conditions occurs, this language necessarily refers back to the original offense of conviction, which is the place where there is a \"term of supervised release authorized by statute\" for a particular offense, <i>e.g.,</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841 (2000) (fixing a four-year <i>minimum</i> for Tapia's original offense).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question how to apply the cap is much more difficult. The government says that the three-year cap applies afresh to the 30-month sentence imposed on Tapia in 2002, so that sentence was within the 36-month maximum. Tapia argues that the cap applies to the <i>aggregate</i> of all time imposed for violating supervised release conditions growing out of the original criminal conviction; if so, then Tapia &#8212; having served 10 months for supervised release violations in 2000 &#8212; could now be sentenced to only 26 months (36 months minus 10 months) for the latest violations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If one looks only to the bare language of subsection (e)(3) quoted above, the most straightforward reading favors the government's position. The three-year cap is described as applying wherever the defendant is found to have violated conditions of supervised release. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(e)(3). Nothing in the statute's language says explicitly that in calculating the cap for the second term, the first term is to be subtracted from the three-year maximum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The language of the second sentence of subsection (h) bolsters the government's reading of subsection (e)(3). Subsection (h) imposes a cap of its own on the <i>supervised release term</i> that can be imposed after a defendant is incarcerated for violating release conditions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> And this cap explicitly incorporates a \"subtraction\" principle: the \"less any term\" language means that whatever new term of supervised release could otherwise be imposed must be reduced by the term or terms of imprisonment previously served for violating supervised release. Still, the inference in the government's favor is somewhat tempered because (h) was not drafted until well after the original (e)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does the government's reading create a cruel or senseless result. True, a defendant might serve successive substantial terms for supervised release violations for the same original crime; but each one would be for a new supervised release violation. Further, if prior terms had to be aggregated, then when the maximum cap figure had been served the defendant could violate minor conditions with impunity. By contrast, subsection (h)'s own aggregation requirement usually prevents indefinite re-imprisonment because eventually no new term of supervised release can be imposed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So far the case for the government looks strong. But note that reading the statute Tapia's way is not flatly contrary to subsection (e)(3)'s language, as it might be if that subsection affirmatively said that the three-year cap should be applied without subtraction of any term of imprisonment served for a prior violation of release conditions. Indeed, subsection (e)(3) does provide that the amount of imprisonment is to be calculated \"without credit for time previously served on post-release supervision\" but it makes no mention of denying credit for time already served on post-release imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(e)(3) (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even so it is surprising that the best legislative history available as to subsection (e)(3) squarely supports Tapia's reading of the statute. The 1991 Senate Report discussing virtually the same language adopted in 1994 makes clear that the cap is to apply to the aggregate term of all imprisonments for release condition violations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The report contains a precise example to this effect:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For example, in the case of a Class C felony for which the maximum supervised release term is three years, a defendant who is revoked and re-imprisoned for 18 months could be ordered to serve as much as 18 additional months on supervised release (36-month maximum term of supervised release &#8212; 18 months imprisonment = 18 months possible re-release supervision). <i>If the same defendant was again revoked, he could be re-imprisoned for not exceeding six months (24-month cap &#8212; 18 months previously-served imprisonment = 6 months allowable imprisonment)</i> and if so imprisoned, could not thereafter be placed on supervision (because the two-year imprisonment cap would have been reached). Thus, under [the amendments], a defendant would always be credited for incarceration time against both the cap on re-imprisonment and the maximum authorized period of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">137 Cong. Rec. S7772 (daily ed. June 13, 1991) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Just as the \"plain meaning\" of statutes is a matter of degree, so legislative history is not all of a piece. Here, the Senate Report is no chance remark in a hearing or on the floor but is a full-scale explanation of the bill in detail, and it is clarity itself on the point at issue. Arguably, the author of the report misread subsection (e)(3), a technical provision that was not the main focus of legislative attention in 1994; but nevertheless this was the gloss Congress had before it when it reenacted the subsection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, perhaps prompted by the legislative history, the government conceded in several prior circuit cases that the imprisonment cap should be reduced by revocation terms already served. <i>Five</i> circuits have now adopted Tapia's reading of the statute, although all were in dicta, after government concessions, or both.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Among them, only the Fifth Circuit followed this course \"<i>dubitante,</i>\" pointing out (as we have done above) that the statutory language taken alone favors the government. <i>United States v. Jackson,</i> 329 F.3d 406, 408 n. 7 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our own case, the U.S. Attorney's office, reading the statute afresh, urges us to follow the language and disregard the legislative history. Although this is a very close call, we decline to do so. As already noted, the statute's language does not strictly forbid the interpolated limitation sought by Tapia; this result is endorsed by unusually explicit legislative history; it has been several times conceded by the government; and five circuits have now followed the government's original concessions. To the extent that we are left with any uncertainty after these considerations, the rule of lenity applies to tip the balance in the defendant's favor. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Luna-Diaz,</i> 222 F.3d 1, 3 n. 2 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The outcome does not threaten much harm. A three-year cap even in the aggregate would normally suffice to punish even a succession of petty supervised release violations like failing to report. Where the violation is more serious (such as drugs), it is independently a crime and can be independently prosecuted in a criminal case. And, if a new Congress disliked the result spelled out in the 1991 legislative history, it could easily amend subsection (e)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It turns out, although neither side mentioned the point, that Congress <i>has</i> altered the statute to adopt the government's position for the future. The 2003 PROTECT Act adds to subsection (e)(3) the phrase \"on any such revocation\" so that the statute now reads \"a defendant whose term is revoked under this paragraph may not be required to serve on any such revocation more than 5 years if....\" PROTECT Act, Pub.L. No. 108-21, tit. I, &#167; 101(1), 117 Stat. 650, 651 (2003). The intent of the 2003 Congress cannot alter the law as enacted in 1994, but reading the 1994 statute in Tapia's favor has only limited consequences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 2003 amendment does not apply in this case, Tapia having committed the original offense (as well as the new violations) before the latest amendment. <i>Cf. Johnson v. United States,</i> 529 U.S. 694, 701-02, 120 S.Ct. 1795, 146 L.Ed.2d 727 (2000). Nothing in the new statute as it concerns &#167; 3583(e)(3) suggests an effort to apply this amendment retroactively and, of course, the government has not relied upon the new amendment at all. Under the circumstances, the 1994 language as we have construed it governs the remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment adjudicating violation of conditions of release is <i>affirmed</i> but the term of imprisonment must be reduced from 30 to 26 months and the matter is <i>remanded</i> for this purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>It is so ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> At the time of the arrest and preliminary hearing, the rules governing such proceedings were set forth in an earlier version of Fed.

He was sentenced to five years of imprisonment followed by five years of supervised release. Tapia was released after his term of imprisonment but in January 2000, he violated the terms of his supervised release and, after a revocation hearing, was sentenced to ten months in prison for the violation and four years of supervised release following this new term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 2002, the Probation Office notified the court by motion that Tapia had again violated the conditions of his supervised release by failing to report to the probation officer and failing to notify the office of his change of address. In December 2002, the district court conducted a revocation hearing. As soon as the district judge stated the charges, Tapia's counsel said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the Court should know that Mr. Tapia is not going to contest the allegations, the violation of failing to report to the probation officers as directed and failing to notify a change of address within 72 hours.

After finding that the violations had occurred, the district judge rejected this suggestion, saying that this was the second time Tapia had violated release conditions. The judge imposed a new term of 30 months' imprisonment (but no further term of supervised release following this imprisonment). This sentence exceeded the period &#8212; apparently five to eleven months &#8212; recommended by the Sentencing Commission's table, U.S.S.G. &#167; 7B1.4 (2002); but this table is an \"advisory\" policy statement rather than a formal guideline. U.S.S.G. ch. 7, pt. A introductory cmt. 3(a) (2002); <i>United States v. Ramirez-Rivera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199285\"><a href=\"/opinion/199285/united-states-v-ramirez-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, 40 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal, Tapia does not challenge the district judge's deviation from the guidelines' suggested range. Instead, Tapia first argues that the finding of liability cannot stand because there was no admission by Tapia personally, no independent evidence of his violations, and no proper waiver of his right to a hearing to contest the charges. Tapia then claims that the 30-month term of imprisonment violated a statutory cap governing maximum penalties for violating conditions of release, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(e)(3) (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">None of these claims were raised in the district court. Accordingly, one might expect the government to argue that the plain error standard had to be met on appeal, but it has not done so. Anyway, the attacks on liability fail whether reviewed under the plain error standard or ordinary standards of review. As for the statutory cap issue, we think there is an error which might or might not be treated as plain under <i>United States v. Olano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span>, 732-36, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">508</span></a></span> (1993); but since the plain error issue is itself complicated and the government has not argued for applying the <i>Olano</i> test, we consider the statutory cap issue on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the challenge to the district court's finding that Tapia violated conditions of his release. After Tapia's arrest, he was brought before a magistrate judge on November 20, 2002, for a preliminary hearing to establish probable cause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The government relied on the Probation Office's report, and Tapia's counsel reserved his defense. The magistrate judge then advised Tapia and his counsel that Tapia would be held for the revocation hearing, adding:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Tapia] is entitled to bring his own witnesses and to challenge any evidence the Government presents as well as to cross examine any Government witness or bring his own evidence to show that the violation[s] were not committed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My instruction to the Probation Office is that the Defendant is to be provided with the discovery available to sustain the allegation or the representations made in the motion for revocation of condition of release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the revocation hearing held on December 2, 2002, Tapia's counsel intervened as soon as the judge explained that Tapia had been ordered arrested because of his violation of conditions of release and had allegedly admitted that he was using heroin. Counsel then made the statement quoted earlier explaining that Tapia was not going to contest the failure to report and notify allegations and that Tapia had also \"accepted\" the truth of the charge that he had been using heroin. Counsel then launched immediately into his proposal for home detention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, in the arguments about the proper penalty, Tapia's violations were taken for granted and the district judge did no more than make a formal finding to that effect when he announced the penalty. At no point did the judge ask Tapia personally whether he committed the violations or whether he waived his right to have evidence presented on this subject; and the government neither presented nor described any independent evidence of the violations. All this, says Tapia, rendered the finding of violations improper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This would certainly be so if the proceeding were one under Rule 11 for the taking of a plea of guilty,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> but the revocation proceeding is of a more informal character. The principal requirements laid down by Rule 32.1 for the merits hearing are notice of the alleged violation, right to counsel, an opportunity to appear and present evidence and a (qualified) right on request to question adverse witnesses. Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.1(b)(2)(A)-(D). Tapia was advised of these rights at his preliminary hearing, he had counsel, and he makes no claim that the charges were unknown to him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, this court has insisted that before the defendant forgoes the opportunity in a revocation case to contest the charges, the defendant must understand his procedural rights and choose not to exercise them. <i>United States v. Correa-Torres,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200421\"><a href=\"/opinion/200421/united-states-v-correa-torres/\"><span class=\"volume\">326</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 22-23 (1st Cir. 2003). <i>Correa-Torres</i> stressed that there is no talismanic formula; the judgment depends both on what the defendant was told and upon \"the totality of the attendant circumstances.\" <i>Id.</i> at 23. The court there was especially concerned because the defendant himself expressed some disagreement with the truth of the charges, yet no evidence was taken or formal waiver secured. <i>Id.</i> at 24.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It would have simplified matters if the district court had addressed Tapia, asked him whether he understood and admitted to the charges, and obtained his personal acquiescence. But, taking account of \"the attendant circumstances,\" we are satisfied for the reasons discussed below that Tapia did understand the charges, knew he could contest them, and chose not to do so. In addition, it appears that there was ample evidence of the violations, which needed only be shown by a preponderance of the evidence, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(e)(3) (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The motion by the Probation Office that started the proceeding was precise as to dates and details. It said that Tapia had failed to report as required, or to call to excuse his absence, on two specific dates: June 25 and August 7, 2002. It also said that during a home visit on August 15, 2002, family members had admitted that Tapia had not returned home since August 7, 2002, and that he \"has been using controlled substances.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the detailed charges were known, Tapia was told of his procedural rights at the preliminary hearing, defense counsel made clear in Tapia's presence that Tapia did not contest the charges and had admitted drug use, and Tapia made no protest that any of this was unclear or inaccurate. Further, Tapia was not a novice. In addition to his prior criminal history, he had been through a guilty plea proceeding in this very case and had even been through a revocation proceeding for his first violation of release conditions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even now, nothing affirmatively suggests that Tapia misunderstood his options or that he had any defense to the charges against him. He did not move in the district court after sentencing to challenge the finding of violations, just the length of the sentence. Nor has he identified on appeal anything that he misunderstood or might reasonably have misunderstood. And he has never suggested that he had a defense to any of the charges.

The first claim is wrong &#8212; Tapia's counsel appeared to retreat from it at oral argument &#8212; but the second we accept by a very close margin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Starting as always with the statutory language, <i>Spookyworld, Inc. v. Town of Berlin</i> (<i>In re Spookyworld, Inc.</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200665\"><a href=\"/opinion/200665/spookyworld-inc-v-town-of-berlin/\"><span class=\"volume\">346</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir.2003), the main provision at issue is 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(e)(3) (2000), which authorizes re-imprisonment for violations of supervised release conditions and fixes caps on the possible new terms of imprisonment. It was originally enacted in 1987 but was modestly modified and reenacted in full as part of a set of amendments in 1994. Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Pub.L. No. 103-322, Sec. 110505, &#167; 3583(e)(3), 108 Stat. 1796, 2016-17 (1994). At the time of Tapia's crime and later violations, this section said in pertinent part that if a defendant violates conditions of release, the court may</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">revoke a term of supervised release, and require the defendant to serve in prison all or part of the term of supervised release authorized by statute for the offense that resulted in such term of supervised release without credit for time previously served on postrelease supervision ... except that a defendant whose terms is revoked under this paragraph may not be required to serve more than 5 years in prison if the offense that resulted in the term of supervised release is a class A felony, more than 3 years in prison if such offense is a class B felony, more than 2 years in prison if such offense is a class C or D felony....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(e)(3) (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since Tapia's original drug offense carried a forty-year maximum it is a class B felony, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3559(a)(2) (2000), and so the three-year cap for revocation applies to Tapia. Tapia's counsel argued in his brief that the cap should be the two-year cap for a class C felony because the district judge found that Tapia's violation was only a grade C offense; but the district judge was there referring to the Commission's classification scheme used to fix a recommended sentence range for the <i>violation of conditions,</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 7B1.4 (2002); this is a different scheme used for a different purpose.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By contrast the cap for <i>maximum reimprisonment</i> is a <i>binding</i> cap fixed by the statute and is keyed not to the violation of conditions but to \"the term of supervised release authorized by statute for the offense that resulted in such term of supervised release.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(e)(3). Although slightly confusing where a second violation of conditions occurs, this language necessarily refers back to the original offense of conviction, which is the place where there is a \"term of supervised release authorized by statute\" for a particular offense, <i>e.g.,</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841 (2000) (fixing a four-year <i>minimum</i> for Tapia's original offense).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question how to apply the cap is much more difficult. The government says that the three-year cap applies afresh to the 30-month sentence imposed on Tapia in 2002, so that sentence was within the 36-month maximum. Tapia argues that the cap applies to the <i>aggregate</i> of all time imposed for violating supervised release conditions growing out of the original criminal conviction; if so, then Tapia &#8212; having served 10 months for supervised release violations in 2000 &#8212; could now be sentenced to only 26 months (36 months minus 10 months) for the latest violations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If one looks only to the bare language of subsection (e)(3) quoted above, the most straightforward reading favors the government's position. The three-year cap is described as applying wherever the defendant is found to have violated conditions of supervised release. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(e)(3). Nothing in the statute's language says explicitly that in calculating the cap for the second term, the first term is to be subtracted from the three-year maximum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The language of the second sentence of subsection (h) bolsters the government's reading of subsection (e)(3). Subsection (h) imposes a cap of its own on the <i>supervised release term</i> that can be imposed after a defendant is incarcerated for violating release conditions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> And this cap explicitly incorporates a \"subtraction\" principle: the \"less any term\" language means that whatever new term of supervised release could otherwise be imposed must be reduced by the term or terms of imprisonment previously served for violating supervised release. Still, the inference in the government's favor is somewhat tempered because (h) was not drafted until well after the original (e)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does the government's reading create a cruel or senseless result. True, a defendant might serve successive substantial terms for supervised release violations for the same original crime; but each one would be for a new supervised release violation. Further, if prior terms had to be aggregated, then when the maximum cap figure had been served the defendant could violate minor conditions with impunity. By contrast, subsection (h)'s own aggregation requirement usually prevents indefinite re-imprisonment because eventually no new term of supervised release can be imposed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So far the case for the government looks strong. But note that reading the statute Tapia's way is not flatly contrary to subsection (e)(3)'s language, as it might be if that subsection affirmatively said that the three-year cap should be applied without subtraction of any term of imprisonment served for a prior violation of release conditions. Indeed, subsection (e)(3) does provide that the amount of imprisonment is to be calculated \"without credit for time previously served on post-release supervision\" but it makes no mention of denying credit for time already served on post-release imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(e)(3) (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even so it is surprising that the best legislative history available as to subsection (e)(3) squarely supports Tapia's reading of the statute. The 1991 Senate Report discussing virtually the same language adopted in 1994 makes clear that the cap is to apply to the aggregate term of all imprisonments for release condition violations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The report contains a precise example to this effect:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For example, in the case of a Class C felony for which the maximum supervised release term is three years, a defendant who is revoked and re-imprisoned for 18 months could be ordered to serve as much as 18 additional months on supervised release (36-month maximum term of supervised release &#8212; 18 months imprisonment = 18 months possible re-release supervision). <i>If the same defendant was again revoked, he could be re-imprisoned for not exceeding six months (24-month cap &#8212; 18 months previously-served imprisonment = 6 months allowable imprisonment)</i> and if so imprisoned, could not thereafter be placed on supervision (because the two-year imprisonment cap would have been reached). Thus, under [the amendments], a defendant would always be credited for incarceration time against both the cap on re-imprisonment and the maximum authorized period of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">137 Cong. Rec. S7772 (daily ed. June 13, 1991) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Just as the \"plain meaning\" of statutes is a matter of degree, so legislative history is not all of a piece. Here, the Senate Report is no chance remark in a hearing or on the floor but is a full-scale explanation of the bill in detail, and it is clarity itself on the point at issue. Arguably, the author of the report misread subsection (e)(3), a technical provision that was not the main focus of legislative attention in 1994; but nevertheless this was the gloss Congress had before it when it reenacted the subsection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, perhaps prompted by the legislative history, the government conceded in several prior circuit cases that the imprisonment cap should be reduced by revocation terms already served. <i>Five</i> circuits have now adopted Tapia's reading of the statute, although all were in dicta, after government concessions, or both.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Among them, only the Fifth Circuit followed this course \"<i>dubitante,</i>\" pointing out (as we have done above) that the statutory language taken alone favors the government. <i>United States v. Jackson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781993\"><a href=\"/opinion/781993/united-states-v-charles-n-jackson/\"><span class=\"volume\">329</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">406</span></a></span>, 408 n. 7 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our own case, the U.S. Attorney's office, reading the statute afresh, urges us to follow the language and disregard the legislative history. Although this is a very close call, we decline to do so. As already noted, the statute's language does not strictly forbid the interpolated limitation sought by Tapia; this result is endorsed by unusually explicit legislative history; it has been several times conceded by the government; and five circuits have now followed the government's original concessions. To the extent that we are left with any uncertainty after these considerations, the rule of lenity applies to tip the balance in the defendant's favor. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Luna-Diaz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199022\"><a href=\"/opinion/199022/united-states-v-luna-diaz/\"><span class=\"volume\">222</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 n. 2 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The outcome does not threaten much harm. A three-year cap even in the aggregate would normally suffice to punish even a succession of petty supervised release violations like failing to report. Where the violation is more serious (such as drugs), it is independently a crime and can be independently prosecuted in a criminal case. And, if a new Congress disliked the result spelled out in the 1991 legislative history, it could easily amend subsection (e)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It turns out, although neither side mentioned the point, that Congress <i>has</i> altered the statute to adopt the government's position for the future. The 2003 PROTECT Act adds to subsection (e)(3) the phrase \"on any such revocation\" so that the statute now reads \"a defendant whose term is revoked under this paragraph may not be required to serve on any such revocation more than 5 years if....\" PROTECT Act, Pub.L. No. 108-21, tit. I, &#167; 101(1), 117 Stat. 650, 651 (2003). The intent of the 2003 Congress cannot alter the law as enacted in 1994, but reading the 1994 statute in Tapia's favor has only limited consequences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 2003 amendment does not apply in this case, Tapia having committed the original offense (as well as the new violations) before the latest amendment. <i>Cf. Johnson v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118364\"><a href=\"/opinion/118364/johnson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">694</span></a></span>, 701-02, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118364\"><a href=\"/opinion/118364/johnson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">727</span></a></span> (2000). Nothing in the new statute as it concerns &#167; 3583(e)(3) suggests an effort to apply this amendment retroactively and, of course, the government has not relied upon the new amendment at all.
