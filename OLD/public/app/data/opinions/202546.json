George Z. Singal, U.S. District Judge]\n          [Hon. David M. Cohen, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                 Selya and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Eric M.

Benjamin, Jr., with whom Thompson & Bowie, LLP was\non brief, for municipal appellees.\n     John J. Wall, III, with whom Monaghan Leahy, LLP was on brief,\nfor county appellees.\n\n\n                        December 11, 2006\n\f           SELYA, Circuit Judge. In this civil rights case, brought\n\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, plaintiff-appellant Morgan Calvi\n\nbeseeches us to reverse the entry of summary judgment in favor of\n\nvarious   county    and   municipal     defendants.1   In   rapid-fire\n\nsuccession, she attacks the constitutionality of summary judgment,\n\nthe district court's assessment of the evidence, and the court's\n\nconcomitant refusal to consider certain claims on the ground that\n\nthey were outside the compass of her complaint.         Discerning no\n\nerror, we affirm.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           The pivotal facts are laid out in considerable detail in\n\nthe recommended decision of the magistrate judge, see Calvi v. City\n\nof Rockland, Civ. No. 05-11, 2006 WL 890687 (D. Me. Mar. 31, 2006),\n\nand we assume the reader's familiarity with that decision.\n\n           On January 19, 2003, a 911 operator, reacting to a male\n\ncaller (later identified as Matthew Hayden) who had locked himself\n\nin his room because a woman was brandishing a knife in his house,\n\ndispatched Officer Kenneth Smith of the Rockland police department\n\nto 89 Talbot Avenue, Rockland, Maine. Several people, most of them\n\nunrelated, lived at that address.         Smith was familiar with the\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Calvi also sued under the Maine Civil Rights Act, Me. Rev.\nStat. Ann. tit. 5, § 4681 et seq. The issues on appeal, however,\nhave been briefed and argued exclusively in terms of section 1983.\nAccordingly, we omit any further reference to the counterpart state\nstatute.\n\n                                  -2-\n\flocus, having gone there the day before to settle a dispute between\n\nCalvi and another tenant, Kevin Warren.\n\n           The dispatcher told Smith that Calvi had been identified\n\nas the knife-wielder.       When Smith arrived at the residence, the\n\nlandlord (Lawrence Frier) agreed to go inside and find Calvi.\n\nAround the same time, Warren — who had fled the scene — called the\n\ndispatcher and asked if it was safe to go back.         Upon learning that\n\nthe   police   were   on   the   premises,   he   returned   and   played   an\n\naudiotape for Smith.        Warren told Smith that four people — he,\n\nFrier, Calvi, and Hayden — were present when the tape was made\n\ninside the dwelling. Apparently, Calvi had begun yelling at Warren\n\nbecause he \"made faces\" at her.         When Warren (an alleged martial\n\narts expert) approached Calvi, she snatched a butcher knife from\n\nthe sinkboard.\n\n           On the tape, Calvi, obviously upset, could be heard\n\nlaunching a series of accusations at Warren.          Frier could be heard\n\nimploring Calvi to be reasonable and, at one point, stating to her:\n\n\"Morgan, that's a felony.\"          Warren eventually fled, and Hayden\n\ncalled the police.\n\n           By the time that Frier located Calvi, another officer was\n\nat the scene.    Calvi told Smith that she wanted to tell her side of\n\nthe story.     Smith, however, arrested her on the spot, charged her\n\nwith criminal threatening with a dangerous weapon, see Me. Rev.\n\nStat. Ann. tit. 17-A, § 209, and stated that she could relate her\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fversion later.       Frier gave Calvi bail money and told Smith to be\n\ngentle because she was frail and had recently undergone elbow\n\nsurgery.\n\n            Smith placed Calvi in handcuffs and double-locked them\n\nbehind her back so that they would not tighten.                    He then marched\n\nher outside, deposited her in his cruiser, and belted her in for\n\ntransport    to   the      Knox     County    jail.    Smith's    fellow      officer,\n\nSergeant Jeffrey McLaughlin, was at the scene but had no real\n\ninteraction with Calvi; McLaughlin spent his time talking with\n\nWarren and Hayden.\n\n            When handcuffing Calvi and assisting her into the back\n\nseat of the cruiser, Smith, who had been trained as a paramedic,\n\ndid   not   observe     any       debilitating     condition.      He   did    notice,\n\nhowever, that Calvi was crying during the five-to-six-minute drive\n\nto the jail.        All in all, Calvi was handcuffed for no more than\n\nfifteen minutes.\n\n            While     Calvi       has   several    disabilities,    the    only    one\n\nrelevant     here     is      a    birth     defect   that      required      surgical\n\nstraightening of three of the fingers on her left hand.                       Although\n\nthis disability is painful, it has never prevented Calvi from doing\n\nroutine activities such as dressing herself, feeding herself, or\n\nworking at Wal-Mart.\n\n            Upon arriving at the lockup, Smith transferred custody of\n\nhis prisoner to a Knox County correctional officer, Rebecca Gracie.\n\n\n                                             -4-\n\fGracie unlocked the handcuffs, patted Calvi down, and placed her in\n\na holding cell.           After other required aspects of the booking\n\nprocess    had     been     completed,      another      Knox   County    officer\n\nfingerprinted Calvi.        Gracie was present during the fingerprinting\n\nbut had no direct involvement with Calvi at that stage.\n\n              Calvi claims that the officer who fingerprinted her\n\nrepeatedly pushed her fingers down hard, in spite of being told\n\nthat she had a hand deformity.                 She further claims that the\n\nfingerprinting caused injuries to her wrist and surgically repaired\n\nmiddle finger.         Calvi eventually was released on bail that same\n\nday.\n\n              In   due    course,   Calvi      brought   suit   against    Smith,\n\nMcLaughlin, and Gracie (in each instance alleging excessive force)\n\nand against the City of Rockland, Knox County, and the county\n\nsheriff,      Daniel     Davey   (in   each     instance   alleging      secondary\n\nliability, e.g., failure to supervise, failure to train).                  She did\n\nnot sue, and has never sued, the Knox County correctional officer\n\nwho fingerprinted her.\n\n              Following pretrial discovery, the various defendants\n\nmoved for summary judgment.              The district court referred the\n\nmotions to a magistrate judge, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b), who\n\nrecommended that they be granted.             See Calvi, 2006 WL 890687, at *\n\n1.     Over    Calvi's     objection,    the    district    judge   adopted    the\n\nrecommended decision and entered summary judgment in favor of all\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fdefendants.2   See Calvi v. City of Rockland, Civ. No. 05-11, 2006\n\nWL 1139924 (D. Me. Apr. 26, 2006).    This timely appeal ensued.\n\nII.   THE SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\n\n           It is common ground that appellate review of an order\n\ngranting summary judgment is de novo and is confined to the record\n\nthat was before the district court.   See Mandel v. Boston Phoenix,\n\nInc., 456 F.3d 198, 204 (1st Cir. 2006).    In effecting such review,\n\nthe court of appeals must take as true the facts documented in the\n\nrecord below, resolving any factual conflicts or disparities in\n\nfavor of the nonmovant.     See Houlton Citizens' Coal. v. Town of\n\nHoulton, 175 F.3d 178, 184 (1st Cir. 1999).      The court must draw\n\nall reasonable inferences from the assembled facts in the light\n\nmost hospitable to the nonmovant.     Id.    If — and only if — the\n\nfacts, so marshaled, show \"that there is no genuine issue as to any\n\nmaterial fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment\n\nas a matter of law,\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c), will the entry of\n\nsummary judgment be affirmed.   See DePoutot v. Raffaelly, 424 F.3d\n\n112, 117 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n           In implementing the summary judgment standard, an issue\n\nis considered genuine if \"it may reasonably be resolved in favor of\n\neither party\" at trial.   Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc., 895 F.2d 46,\n\n48 (1st Cir. 1990).   By like token, a fact is considered material\n\n\n      2\n      Because the district judge and the magistrate judge shared\nthe same appraisal of the case, we take an institutional view and\nrefer to the decision below as that of the district court.\n\n                                -6-\n\fif it possesses \"the capacity to sway the outcome of the litigation\n\nunder the applicable law.\"               Nat'l Amusements, Inc. v. Town of\n\nDedham, 43 F.3d 731, 735 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n               Of course, the nonmovant may defeat a summary judgment\n\nmotion       by   demonstrating,        through    submissions     of   evidentiary\n\nquality, that a trialworthy issue persists.                       Celotex Corp. v.\n\nCatrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-24 (1986).                  Doing so, however, requires\n\nmore than the frenzied brandishing of a cardboard sword.                      As we\n\nhave       warned,   \"a    conglomeration         of    'conclusory     allegations,\n\nimprobable inferences, and unsupported speculation' is insufficient\n\nto discharge the nonmovant's burden.\"                   DePoutot, 424 F.3d at 117\n\n(quoting Medina-Munoz v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 896 F.2d 5, 8\n\n(1st Cir. 1990)).\n\n               It is with this standard in mind that we turn to Calvi's\n\nclaims of error.\n\nIII.       THE CONSTITUTIONAL CLAIM\n\n               In a broadside directed at the district court proceedings\n\nas     a    whole,    Calvi   contends        that      summary   judgment   is    an\n\nunconstitutional abridgement of her Seventh Amendment right to\n\ntrial by jury.        That contention is hopeless.\n\n               Summary judgment has a unique place in federal civil\n\nlitigation.          Its   \"role   is    to   pierce     the   boilerplate   of   the\n\npleadings and assay the parties' proof in order to determine\n\nwhether trial is actually required.\"                 Wynne v. Tufts Univ. Sch. of\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\fMed., 976 F.2d 791, 794 (1st Cir. 1992).          \"The device allows courts\n\nand litigants to avoid full-blown trials in unwinnable cases, thus\n\nconserving the parties' time and money, and permitting courts to\n\nhusband      scarce   judicial    resources.\"      McCarthy    v.   Northwest\n\nAirlines, Inc., 56 F.3d 313, 315 (1st Cir. 1995).              So viewed, a\n\ngrant   of     summary   judgment    does   not   compromise    the   Seventh\n\nAmendment's jury trial right because that right exists only with\n\nrespect to genuinely disputed issues of material fact.              See Harris\n\nv. Interstate Brands Corp., 348 F.3d 761, 762 (8th Cir. 2003).\n\n              Not uniquely, the District of Maine's local rules require\n\nthe filing, with every motion for summary judgment, of a short and\n\nconcise statement of the material facts, with appropriate record\n\nreferences.      See D. Me. R. 56(b).        A related rule provides in\n\npertinent part that \"[a] party opposing a motion for summary\n\njudgment shall submit with its opposition a separate, short, and\n\nconcise statement of material facts [which] shall admit, deny or\n\nqualify the facts by reference to each numbered paragraph of the\n\nmoving party's statement of material facts and unless a fact is\n\nadmitted, shall support each denial or qualification by a record\n\ncitation.\"      Id. 56(c).       Calvi asserts, without any citation to\n\npersuasive authority, that these rules are unconstitutional because\n\nthey ensure a trial by paper that, in the final analysis, is no\n\ntrial at all.      This assertion is baseless.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\f           The District of Maine's local rules and similar local\n\nrules in other districts within this circuit were developed in\n\nresponse to this court's stated concern \"that, absent such rules,\n\nsummary judgment practice could too easily become a game of cat-\n\nand-mouse.\" Ruiz Rivera v. Riley, 209 F.3d 24, 28 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\nSuch local rules are useful devices for focusing a district court's\n\nattention on what is — and what is not — genuinely controverted.\n\nSuch rules are desirable in other ways as well.           For one thing,\n\nthey have the capacity to dispel the smokescreen behind which\n\nlitigants with marginal or unwinnable cases often seek to hide.\n\nFor another thing, they greatly reduce the possibility that the\n\ndistrict court will fall victim to an ambush.         Cf. Stepanischen v.\n\nMerchants Despatch Transp. Corp., 722 F.2d 922, 931 (1st Cir. 1983)\n\n(warning that, without such a rule, the justice system risks the\n\n\"specter of district court judges being unfairly sandbagged by\n\nunadvertised factual issues\").\n\n           In view of these considerations and the lack of any\n\ncogent   constitutional   objection,    we     have    regularly   upheld\n\nchallenges to the constitutionality and fairness of such local\n\nrules.   See, e.g., Cosme-Rosado v. Serrano-Rodriguez, 360 F.3d 42,\n\n45 (1st Cir. 2004); Ruiz Rivera, 209 F.3d at 28; Jaroma v. Massey,\n\n873 F.2d 17, 20 (1st Cir. 1989).       Calvi has offered us no sound\n\nreason for revisiting these decisions.       Consequently, we hold that\n\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fD. Me. R. 56(b) and (c), like Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 itself, do not\n\nviolate the Seventh Amendment.\n\nIV.    THE EXCESSIVE FORCE CLAIMS\n\n              We turn next to Calvi's excessive force claims.              Because\n\nthe City of Rockland defendants are situated somewhat differently\n\nfrom the Knox County defendants, we divide this portion of our\n\nanalysis into two segments.\n\n                         A.   The Rockland Defendants.\n\n              Counts 1 and 4 of Calvi's complaint allege in substance\n\nthat   the    Rockland     police       officers   used    excessive   force     when\n\nhandcuffing Calvi.            In order to prevail on such a claim, a\n\nplaintiff      must   establish         that     the   defendant's     actions     in\n\nhandcuffing her were objectively unreasonable in light of the\n\ncircumstances and the facts known to the officer at the time.                     See\n\nGraham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 397 (1989); Isom v. Town of Warren,\n\n360 F.3d 7, 10-11 (1st Cir. 2004); see also Alexis v. McDonald's\n\nRest. of Mass., Inc., 67 F.3d 341, 352 (1st Cir. 1995).                          This\n\nshowing must take into account the reasonableness of the officer's\n\nactions, viewed from the perspective of a prototypical officer\n\nconfronted with the same or similar circumstances.                     Graham, 490\n\nU.S. at 396.      All of the attendant facts must be considered.                  See\n\nid.    Police work is often carried out in fast-moving and poorly\n\ndefined      situations,      so   it    is   especially    unfair   to   judge    an\n\nofficer's actions in hindsight.                See id. at 396-97.\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\f                 Applying this framework, it is readily apparent that the\n\nentry       of    summary   judgment   in   Sergeant    McLaughlin's   favor   is\n\nunimpugnable. There is not a shred of evidence that McLaughlin had\n\nanything to do with Calvi's handcuffing.               His mere presence at the\n\nscene, without more, does not by some mysterious alchemy render him\n\nlegally responsible under section 1983 for the actions of a fellow\n\nofficer.          See Gaudreault v. Municipality of Salem, 923 F.2d 203,\n\n207 n.3 (1st Cir. 1990).3\n\n                 The case against Smith is slightly more robust — but not\n\nrobust enough to fend off summary judgment.               Smith was responding\n\nto news that a civilian had been brandishing a knife in a dangerous\n\nmanner.          Even if Smith knew that the knife-wielder, Calvi, had a\n\nhand deformity, there is no evidence that he applied any excessive\n\nforce.       Standard police practice called for cuffing an arrestee's\n\nhands behind her back and Smith's decision not to deviate from this\n\npractice was a judgment call, pure and simple. He handcuffed Calvi\n\nin the customary manner and kept her in handcuffs for no more than\n\nthe time reasonably necessary to transport her to the lockup.\n\n\n\n\n        3\n      To be sure, a bystander-officer who has a realistic\nopportunity to prevent the use of excessive force by a fellow\nofficer may in certain circumstances be held liable for a failure\nto intervene. See, e.g., Martinez v. Colon, 54 F.3d 980, 985 (1st\nCir. 1995) (explaining that \"police officers sometimes have an\naffirmative duty to intervene that is enforceable under the Due\nProcess Clause\"); Gaudreault, 923 F.2d at 207 n.3 (similar). Here,\nhowever, Calvi did not timely charge McLaughlin with a failure to\nintervene. See Part V, infra.\n\n                                        -11-\n\f              That is the end of the story.               The totality of the\n\ncircumstances affords no legally sufficient basis for a finding\n\nthat Smith's handcuffing of Calvi represented a constitutionally\n\nproscribed      use     of   excessive   force.   Cf.     Jackson   v.   City   of\n\nBremerton, 268 F.3d 646, 653 (9th Cir. 2001) (concluding that\n\nofficer did not use excessive force in pushing suspect to the\n\nground and kneeling on her back, notwithstanding the suspect having\n\ncomplained of preexisting injuries).              Accordingly, the district\n\ncourt did not err in granting summary judgment for Smith.\n\n              In addition to her claims against the two individual\n\nmembers of the Rockland police department, Calvi attempts to hold\n\nthe City of Rockland responsible for the officers' alleged use of\n\nexcessive force.         She argues that Rockland should be held liable\n\nunder section 1983 because it failed adequately to train its police\n\nforce.4      This argument is unavailing.\n\n              With respect to an allegation of failure to train,\n\nliability ordinarily may be found \"where the municipality fails to\n\nprovide adequate training notwithstanding an obvious likelihood\n\nthat       inadequate    training    will   result   in     the   violation     of\n\nconstitutional rights.\"          Whitfield v. Meléndez-Rivera, 431 F.3d 1,\n\n\n\n       4\n      Calvi originally made a related argument: that the City had\na policy or custom that led to the violation of her civil rights.\nShe now backpedals, conceding that the Rockland police department\nhad adopted an appropriate policy for handcuffing disabled\nindividuals. Before us, she seeks to hold the City liable based\nonly on its alleged failure adequately to train Smith.\n\n                                         -12-\n\f10 (1st Cir. 2005).          Showing that a single individual received\n\ninadequate training is insufficient for municipal liability to\n\nattach; the training program as a whole must be found faulty.                 See\n\nCity of Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 390-91 (1989).\n\n              Here, Calvi has not presented a scintilla of evidence\n\ndemonstrating        that    Rockland's       police    force,     overall,      is\n\ninadequately trained in how to handcuff disabled suspects.                    The\n\nonly record evidence is to the contrary: Rockland's officers must\n\nattend      the    Maine   Criminal   Justice    Academy,    and   training      in\n\narresting individuals with physical disabilities is part of the\n\nAcademy's core curriculum.\n\n              We need not probe this point too deeply for — regardless\n\nof the training afforded or the lack of training — it is only when\n\na governmental unit's employee inflicts a constitutional injury\n\nthat the governmental unit can be held liable under section 1983.\n\nSee Evans v. Avery, 100 F.3d 1033, 1039 (1st Cir. 1996).                         It\n\nfollows that the inadequate training of a police officer cannot be\n\na   basis    for    municipal   liability     under    section   1983   unless    a\n\nconstitutional injury has been inflicted by the officer or officers\n\nwhose training was allegedly inferior.            See Young v. City of Prov.\n\nex rel. Napolitano, 404 F.3d 4, 25-26 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n              That ends this aspect of the matter. As explained above,\n\nCalvi has utterly failed to generate a trialworthy issue as to the\n\nuse of excessive force in the handcuffing process by either Smith\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\for McLaughlin.       Since no Rockland police officer inflicted a\n\nconstitutional injury on Calvi, she cannot hold the City liable\n\nunder section 1983 for its officers' alleged lack of training.\n\n                        B.   The Knox Defendants.\n\n              Calvi claims that Knox County and its officers should be\n\nheld liable because of excessive force used during booking (and,\n\nespecially, during fingerprinting). This claim need not detain us.\n\n              Calvi never sued the officer who actually fingerprinted\n\nher.       Instead, her excessive force claim is directed at Gracie\n\n(who, although a supervisory officer, was a mere observer of the\n\nfingerprinting).       Absent   evidence   of   participation,   concerted\n\naction, or at least culpable knowledge, one officer cannot be held\n\njointly liable under section 1983 for another officer's use of\n\nexcessive force.      See, e.g., Gaudreault, 923 F.2d at 207 n.3; see\n\nalso Monell v. Dep't of Social Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 692-94 (1978)\n\n(holding that respondeat superior is inapplicable in section 1983\n\ncases).      There is no such evidence in this record.           Thus, the\n\ndistrict court did not err in entering summary judgment in Gracie's\n\nfavor.\n\n              This leaves the claim against Knox County.5   The facts of\n\nrecord, viewed in the light most favorable to Calvi, demonstrate\n\n\n       5\n      Although Sheriff Daniel Davey has been sued, Calvi\nacknowledges that she sued him only in his official capacity. A\nsuit against a public employee in his official capacity is a suit\nagainst the individual's employer, here, Knox County. See Will v.\nMich. Dep't of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 71 (1989).\n\n                                   -14-\n\fthat    Knox    County    had   in    place   an    appropriate    policy     for\n\nfingerprinting disabled persons.              Even if that policy was not\n\nfollowed   in    this    instance,     as   Calvi   alleges,    that     omission,\n\nstanding alone, would not amount to a constitutional violation\n\nattributable to the county.          See St. Hilaire v. City of Laconia, 71\n\nF.3d 20, 29 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n           There is, moreover, no evidence of any pervasive failure\n\nto train county law enforcement officers in the implementation of\n\nthe county's fingerprinting policy.            For that matter, there is no\n\nevidence that the officer who actually fingerprinted Calvi lacked\n\nproper training.\n\n           To say more on this point would be supererogatory.                 The\n\nupshot is that the district court correctly concluded that the Knox\n\nCounty defendants were entitled to summary judgment.\n\nV.   THE UNPLED CLAIMS\n\n           There is one more leg to our journey.               Calvi objects to\n\nthe district court's determination that she failed properly to\n\nplead certain claims (and, therefore, waived them). We turn now to\n\nthat objection.\n\n           The essential facts are as follows. In her opposition to\n\nthe defendants' motions for summary judgment, Calvi for the first\n\ntime asserted a false arrest claim against Smith and failure to\n\nintervene claims against McLaughlin and Gracie.                  None of these\n\nnewly   minted    claims    had      been   articulated,   or     even    vaguely\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\finsinuated, in Calvi's complaint.      The magistrate judge deemed the\n\nclaims waived, Calvi, 2006 WL 890687, at *7, and the district judge\n\nagreed.\n\n           Calvi argues, in effect, that the Civil Rules require\n\nonly notice pleading, and that notice of the incident subsumes\n\nwithin it notice of any and all claims arising out of the described\n\nnucleus of operative facts.     The first part of her premise is\n\ncorrect; this court has held that there are no heightened pleading\n\nstandards for civil rights cases and that, therefore, notice\n\npleading   rules   apply   to   such     actions.     See   Educadores\n\nPuertorriqueños en Acción v. Hernández, 367 F.3d 61, 66-67 (1st\n\nCir. 2004).   Thus, a plaintiff's complaint need only contain \"a\n\nshort and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is\n\nentitled to relief.\"   Id. at 66 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).\n\n           The second part of Calvi's premise is incorrect.     Notice\n\npleading rules do not relieve a plaintiff of responsibility for\n\nidentifying the nature of her claim.         See Gooley v. Mobil Oil\n\nCorp., 851 F.2d 513, 514 (1st Cir. 1988) (explaining that although\n\nthe requirements of Rule 8(a)(2) are minimal, \"minimal requirements\n\nare not tantamount to nonexistent requirements\").       Consequently,\n\nthe statement of claim must, at a bare minimum, \"give the defendant\n\nfair notice of what the plaintiff's claim is and the grounds upon\n\nwhich it rests.\"   Educadores, 367 F.3d at 66 (quoting Conley v.\n\nGibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47 (1957)).        This means that, in a civil\n\n\n                                -16-\n\frights action, as in any other civil action subject to notice\n\npleading requirements, the statement of claim must \"at least set\n\nforth minimal facts as to who did what to whom, when, where, and\n\nwhy.\"   Id. at 68.\n\n           As   the   district    court     recognized,   Calvi's   complaint\n\noffends these rudimentary principles insofar as her unpled claims\n\nare concerned.    In her complaint, she alleges that \"with reckless\n\nand deliberate disregard for [her] rights,\" Smith \"physically\n\nabuse[d] her and treat[ed] her cruelly and callously, using force\n\nfar in excess of that necessary under the circumstances, all in\n\nviolation of her rights.\"        This language is sufficient to plead an\n\nexcessive force claim but not a false arrest claim.           At no point in\n\nthe complaint did Calvi say anything to place Smith on notice that\n\nshe was claiming false arrest.\n\n           Calvi's argument that her false arrest claim is implicit\n\nin her excessive force claim lacks merit.           Other courts have held\n\nthat an excessive force claim is not implicit in a false arrest\n\nclaim but, rather, must be stated distinctly. See, e.g., Bashir v.\n\nRockdale County, 445 F.3d 1323, 1331-32 (11th Cir. 2006); cf.\n\nIacobucci v. Boulter, 193 F.3d 14, 19 (1st Cir. 1999) (recognizing\n\nthat false arrest and excessive force are separate and distinct\n\nclaims).   We think that the reverse is equally true: a false arrest\n\nclaim is not implicit in an excessive force claim but, rather, must\n\nbe stated distinctly.\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\f            Much the same is true of Calvi's nascent failure to\n\nintervene claims.    Her complaint named McLaughlin and Gracie as\n\ndefendants but limned only claims of excessive force against them.\n\nNeither a duty to intervene nor a breach of that duty was alluded\n\nto in any way, shape, or form.   Calvi's argument rests, therefore,\n\non the proposition that a failure to intervene claim is implicit in\n\nan excessive force claim directed at multiple defendants.        We\n\nreject that proposition.\n\n            The short of it is that, as the district court held,\n\nCalvi was not entitled to raise new and unadvertised theories of\n\nliability for the first time in opposition to a motion for summary\n\njudgment.    See Torres-Rios v. LPS Labs., Inc., 152 F.3d 11, 15-16\n\n(1st Cir. 1998).\n\nVI.   CONCLUSION.\n\n            We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe uphold the district court's entry of judgment in the defendants'\n\nfavor.\n\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\f",

Discerning no error, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pivotal facts are laid out in considerable detail in the recommended decision of the magistrate judge, <i>see Calvi v. City of Rockland,</i> Civ. No. 05-11, 2006 WL 890687 (D.Me. Mar.31, 2006), and we assume the reader's familiarity with that decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 19, 2003, a 911 operator, reacting to a male caller (later identified as Matthew Hayden) who had locked himself in his room because a woman was brandishing a knife in his house, dispatched Officer Kenneth Smith of the Rockland police department to 89 Talbot Avenue, Rockland, Maine. Several people, most of them unrelated, lived at that address. Smith was familiar with the locus, having gone there the day before to settle a dispute between Calvi and another tenant, Kevin Warren.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dispatcher told Smith that Calvi had been identified as the knife-wielder. When Smith arrived at the residence, the landlord (Lawrence Frier) agreed to go inside and find Calvi. Around the same time, Warren&#8212;who had fled the scene&#8212;called the dispatcher and asked if it was safe to go back. Upon learning that the police were on the premises, he returned and played an audiotape for Smith. Warren told Smith that four people&#8212;he, Frier, Calvi, and Hayden&#8212;were present when the tape was made inside the dwelling. Apparently, Calvi had begun yelling at Warren because he \"made faces\" at her. When Warren (an alleged martial arts expert) approached Calvi, she snatched a butcher knife from the sinkboard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the tape, Calvi, obviously upset, could be heard launching a series of accusations at Warren. Frier could be heard imploring Calvi to be reasonable and, at one point, stating to her: \"Morgan, that's a felony.\" Warren eventually fled, and Hayden called the police.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the time that Frier located Calvi, another officer was at the scene. Calvi told Smith that she wanted to tell her side of the story. Smith, however, arrested her on the spot, charged her with criminal threatening with a dangerous weapon, <i>see</i> Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &#167; 209, and stated that she could relate her version later. Frier gave Calvi bail money and told Smith to be gentle because she was frail and had recently undergone elbow surgery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith placed Calvi in handcuffs and double-locked them behind her back so that they would not tighten. He then marched her outside, deposited her in his cruiser, and belted her in for transport to the Knox County jail. Smith's fellow officer, Sergeant Jeffrey McLaughlin, was at the scene but had no real interaction with Calvi; McLaughlin spent his time talking with Warren and Hayden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When handcuffing Calvi and assisting her into the back seat of the cruiser, Smith, who had been trained as a paramedic, did not observe any debilitating condition. He did notice, however, that Calvi was crying during the five-to-six-minute drive to the jail. All in all, Calvi was handcuffed for no more than fifteen minutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Calvi has several disabilities, the only one relevant here is a birth defect that required surgical straightening of three of the fingers on her left hand. Although this disability is painful, it has never prevented Calvi from doing routine activities such as dressing herself, feeding herself, or working at Wal-Mart.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon arriving at the lockup, Smith transferred custody of his prisoner to a Knox County correctional officer, Rebecca Gracie. Gracie unlocked the handcuffs, patted Calvi down, and placed her in a holding cell. After other required aspects of the booking process had been completed, another Knox County officer fingerprinted Calvi. Gracie was present during the fingerprinting but had no direct involvement with Calvi at that stage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Calvi claims that the officer who fingerprinted her repeatedly pushed her fingers down hard, in spite of being told that she had a hand deformity. She further claims that the fingerprinting caused injuries to her wrist and surgically repaired middle finger. Calvi eventually was released on bail that same day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, Calvi brought suit against Smith, McLaughlin, and Gracie (in each instance alleging excessive force) and against the City of Rockland, Knox County, and the county sheriff, Daniel Davey (in each instance alleging secondary liability, e.g., failure to supervise, failure to train). She did not sue, and has never sued, the Knox County correctional officer who fingerprinted her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following pretrial discovery, the various defendants moved for summary judgment. The district court referred the motions to a magistrate judge, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(b), who recommended that they be granted. <i>See Calvi,</i> 2006 WL 890687, at * 1. Over Calvi's objection, the district judge adopted the recommended decision and entered summary judgment in favor of all defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>See Calvi v. City of Rockland,</i> Civ. No. 05-11, 2006 WL 1139924 (D.Me. Apr.26, 2006). This timely appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. THE SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is common ground that appellate review of an order granting summary judgment is de novo and is confined to the record that was before the district court. <i>See Mandel v. Boston Phoenix, Inc.,</i> 456 F.3d 198, 204 (1st Cir.2006). In effecting such review, the court of appeals must take as true the facts documented in the record below, resolving any factual conflicts or disparities in favor of the nonmovant. <i>See Houlton Citizens' Coal. v. Town of Houlton,</i> 175 F.3d 178, 184 (1st Cir. 1999). The court must draw all reasonable inferences from the assembled facts in the light most hospitable to the nonmovant. <i>Id.</i> If&#8212;and only if&#8212;the facts, so marshaled, show \"that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law,\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c), will the entry of summary judgment be affirmed. <i>See DePoutot v. Raffaelly,</i> 424 F.3d 112, 117 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In implementing the summary judgment standard, an issue is considered genuine if \"it may reasonably be resolved in favor of either party\" at trial. <i>Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc.,</i> 895 F.2d 46, 48 (1st Cir.1990). By like token, a fact is considered material if it possesses \"the capacity to sway the outcome of the litigation under the applicable law.\" <i>Nat'l Amusements, Inc. v. Town of Dedham,</i> 43 F.3d 731, 735 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the nonmovant may defeat a summary judgment motion by demonstrating, through submissions of evidentiary quality, that a trialworthy issue persists. <i>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett,</i> 477 U.S. 317, 322-24, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). Doing so, however, requires more than the frenzied brandishing of a cardboard sword. As we have warned, \"a conglomeration of `conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation' is insufficient to discharge the nonmovant's burden.\" <i>DePoutot,</i> 424 F.3d at 117 (quoting <i>Medina-Munoz v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.,</i> 896 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir.1990)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is with this standard in mind that we turn to Calvi's claims of error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. THE CONSTITUTIONAL CLAIM</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a broadside directed at the district court proceedings as a whole, Calvi contends that summary judgment is an unconstitutional abridgement of her Seventh Amendment right to trial by jury. That contention is hopeless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Summary judgment has a unique place in federal civil litigation. Its \"role is to pierce the boilerplate of the pleadings and assay the parties' proof in order to determine whether trial is actually required.\" <i>Wynne v. Tufts Univ. Sch. of Med.,</i> 976 F.2d 791, 794 (1st Cir.1992). \"The device allows courts and litigants to avoid full-blown trials in unwinnable cases, thus conserving the parties' time and money, and permitting courts to husband scarce judicial resources.\" <i>McCarthy v. Northwest Airlines, Inc.,</i> 56 F.3d 313, 315 (1st Cir.1995). So viewed, a grant of summary judgment does not compromise the Seventh Amendment's jury trial right because that right exists only with respect to genuinely disputed issues of material fact. <i>See Harris v. Interstate Brands Corp.,</i> 348 F.3d 761, 762 (8th Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not uniquely, the District of Maine's local rules require the filing, with every motion for summary judgment, of a short and concise statement of the material facts, with appropriate record references. <i>See</i> D. Me. R. 56(b). A related rule provides in pertinent part that \"[a] party opposing a motion for summary judgment shall submit with its opposition a separate, short, and concise statement of material facts [which] shall admit, deny or qualify the facts by reference to each numbered paragraph of the moving party's statement of material facts and unless a fact is admitted, shall support each denial or qualification by a record citation.\" <i>Id.</i> 56(c). Calvi asserts, without any citation to persuasive authority, that these rules are unconstitutional because they ensure a trial by paper that, in the final analysis, is no trial at all. This assertion is baseless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District of Maine's local rules and similar local rules in other districts within this circuit were developed in response to this court's stated concern \"that, absent such rules, summary judgment practice could too easily become a game of cat-and-mouse.\" <i>Ruiz Rivera v. Riley,</i> 209 F.3d 24, 28 (1st Cir.2000). Such local rules are useful devices for focusing a district court's attention on what is&#8212;and what is not&#8212;genuinely controverted. Such rules are desirable in other ways as well. For one thing, they have the capacity to dispel the smokescreen behind which litigants with marginal or unwinnable cases often seek to hide. For another thing, they greatly reduce the possibility that the district court will fall victim to an ambush. <i>Cf. Stepanischen v. Merchants Despatch Transp. Corp.,</i> 722 F.2d 922, 931 (1st Cir. 1983) (warning that, without such a rule, the justice system risks the \"specter of district court judges being unfairly sandbagged by unadvertised factual issues\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In view of these considerations and the lack of any cogent constitutional objection, we have regularly upheld challenges to the constitutionality and fairness of such local rules. <i>See, e.g., Cosme-Rosado v. Serrano-Rodriguez,</i> 360 F.3d 42, 45 (1st Cir.2004); <i>Ruiz Rivera,</i> 209 F.3d at 28; <i>Jaroma v. Massey,</i> 873 F.2d 17, 20 (1st Cir.1989). Calvi has offered us no sound reason for revisiting these decisions. Consequently, we hold that D. Me. R. 56(b) and (c), like Fed.R.Civ.P. 56 itself, do not violate the Seventh Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. THE EXCESSIVE FORCE CLAIMS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn next to Calvi's excessive force claims. Because the City of Rockland defendants are situated somewhat differently from the Knox County defendants, we divide this portion of our analysis into two segments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>The Rockland Defendants.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counts 1 and 4 of Calvi's complaint allege in substance that the Rockland police officers used excessive force when handcuffing Calvi. In order to prevail on such a claim, a plaintiff must establish that the defendant's actions in handcuffing her were objectively unreasonable in light of the circumstances and the facts known to the officer at the time. <i>See Graham v. Connor,</i> 490 U.S. 386, 397, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989); <i>Isom v. Town of Warren,</i> 360 F.3d 7, 10-11 (1st Cir.2004); <i>see also Alexis v. McDonald's Rests. of Mass., Inc.,</i> 67 F.3d 341, 352 (1st Cir.1995). This showing must take into account the reasonableness of the officer's actions, viewed from the perspective of a prototypical officer confronted with the same or similar circumstances. <i>Graham,</i> 490 U.S. at 396, 109 S.Ct. 1865. All of the attendant facts must be considered. <i>See id.</i> Police work is often carried out in fast-moving and poorly defined situations, so it is especially unfair to judge an officer's actions in hindsight. <i>See id.</i> at 396-97, 109 S.Ct. 1865.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying this framework, it is readily apparent that the entry of summary judgment in Sergeant McLaughlin's favor is unimpugnable. There is not a shred of evidence that McLaughlin had anything to do with Calvi's handcuffing. His mere presence at the scene, without more, does not by some mysterious alchemy render him legally responsible under section 1983 for the actions of a fellow officer. <i>See Gaudreault v. Municipality of Salem,</i> 923 F.2d 203, 207 n. 3 (1st Cir.1990).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case against Smith is slightly more robust&#8212;but not robust enough to fend off summary judgment. Smith was responding to news that a civilian had been brandishing a knife in a dangerous manner. Even if Smith knew that the knife-wielder, Calvi, had a hand deformity, there is no evidence that he applied any excessive force. Standard police practice called for cuffing an arrestee's hands behind her back and Smith's decision not to deviate from this practice was a judgment call, pure and simple. He handcuffed Calvi in the customary manner and kept her in handcuffs for no more than the time reasonably necessary to transport her to the lockup.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That is the end of the story. The totality of the circumstances affords no legally sufficient basis for a finding that Smith's handcuffing of Calvi represented a constitutionally proscribed use of excessive force. <i>Cf. Jackson v. City of Bremerton,</i> 268 F.3d 646, 653 (9th Cir.2001) (concluding that officer did not use excessive force in pushing suspect to the ground and kneeling on her back, notwithstanding the suspect having complained of preexisting injuries). Accordingly, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment for Smith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to her claims against the two individual members of the Rockland police department, Calvi attempts to hold the City of Rockland responsible for the officers' alleged use of excessive force. She argues that Rockland should be held liable under section 1983 because it failed adequately to train its police force.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> This argument is unavailing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to an allegation of failure to train, liability ordinarily may be found \"where the municipality fails to provide adequate training notwithstanding an obvious likelihood that inadequate training will result in the violation of constitutional rights.\" <i>Whitfield v. Mel&#233;ndez-Rivera,</i> 431 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir.2005). Showing that a single individual received inadequate training is insufficient for municipal liability to attach; the training program as a whole must be found faulty. <i>See City of Canton v. Harris,</i> 489 U.S. 378, 390-91, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 103 L.Ed.2d 412 (1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Calvi has not presented a scintilla of evidence demonstrating that Rockland's police force, overall, is inadequately trained in how to handcuff disabled suspects. The only record evidence is to the contrary: Rockland's officers must attend the Maine Criminal Justice Academy, and training in arresting individuals with physical disabilities is part of the Academy's core curriculum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not probe this point too deeply for&#8212;regardless of the training afforded or the lack of training&#8212;it is only when a governmental unit's employee inflicts a constitutional injury that the governmental unit can be held liable under section 1983. <i>See Evans v. Avery,</i> 100 F.3d 1033, 1039 (1st Cir.1996). It follows that the inadequate training of a police officer cannot be a basis for municipal liability under section 1983 unless a constitutional injury has been inflicted by the officer or officers whose training was allegedly inferior. <i>See Young v. City of Prov. ex rel. Napolitano,</i> 404 F.3d 4, 25-26 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this aspect of the matter. As explained above, Calvi has utterly failed to generate a trialworthy issue as to the use of excessive force in the handcuffing process by either Smith or McLaughlin. Since no Rockland police officer inflicted a constitutional injury on Calvi, she cannot hold the City liable under section 1983 for its officers' alleged lack of training.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The Knox Defendants.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Calvi claims that Knox County and its officers should be held liable because of excessive force used during booking (and, especially, during fingerprinting). This claim need not detain us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Calvi never sued the officer who actually fingerprinted her. Instead, her excessive force claim is directed at Gracie (who, although a supervisory officer, was a mere observer of the fingerprinting). Absent evidence of participation, concerted action, or at least culpable knowledge, one officer cannot be held jointly liable under section 1983 for another officer's use of excessive force. <i>See, e.g., Gaudreault,</i> 923 F.2d at 207 n. 3; <i>see also Monell v. Dep't of Social Servs.,</i> 436 U.S. 658, 692-94, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978) (holding that respondeat superior is inapplicable in section 1983 cases). There is no such evidence in this record. Thus, the district court did not err in entering summary judgment in Gracie's favor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves the claim against Knox County.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The facts of record, viewed in the light most favorable to Calvi, demonstrate that Knox County had in place an appropriate policy for fingerprinting disabled persons. Even if that policy was not followed in this instance, as Calvi alleges, that omission, standing alone, would not amount to a constitutional violation <i>attributable to the county. See St. Hilaire v. City of Laconia,</i> 71 F.3d 20, 29 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is, moreover, no evidence of any pervasive failure to train county law enforcement officers in the implementation of the county's fingerprinting policy. For that matter, there is no evidence that the officer who actually fingerprinted Calvi lacked proper training.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more on this point would be supererogatory. The upshot is that the district court correctly concluded that the Knox County defendants were entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V. THE UNPLED CLAIMS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is one more leg to our journey. Calvi objects to the district court's determination that she failed properly to plead certain claims (and, therefore, waived them). We turn now to that objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The essential facts are as follows. In her opposition to the defendants' motions for summary judgment, Calvi for the first time asserted a false arrest claim against Smith and failure to intervene claims against McLaughlin and Gracie. None of these newly minted claims had been articulated, or even vaguely insinuated, in Calvi's complaint. The magistrate judge deemed the claims waived, <i>Calvi,</i> 2006 WL 890687, at *7, and the district judge agreed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Calvi argues, in effect, that the Civil Rules require only notice pleading, and that notice of the incident subsumes within it notice of any and all claims arising out of the described nucleus of operative facts. The first part of her premise is correct; this court has held that there are no heightened pleading standards for civil rights cases and that, therefore, notice pleading rules apply to such actions. <i>See Educadores Puertorrique&#241;os en Acci&#243;n v. Hern&#225;ndez,</i> 367 F.3d 61, 66-67 (1st Cir. 2004). Thus, a plaintiff's complaint need only contain \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" <i>Id.</i> at 66 (citing Fed. R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second part of Calvi's premise is incorrect. Notice pleading rules do not relieve a plaintiff of responsibility for identifying the nature of her claim. <i>See Gooley v. Mobil Oil Corp.,</i> 851 F.2d 513, 514 (1st Cir.1988) (explaining that although the requirements of Rule 8(a)(2) are minimal, \"minimal requirements are not tantamount to nonexistent requirements\"). Consequently, the statement of claim must, at a bare minimum, \"give the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiff's claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\" <i>Educadores,</i> 367 F.3d at 66 (quoting <i>Conley v. Gibson,</i> 355 U.S. 41, 47, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957)). This means that, in a civil rights action, as in any other civil action subject to notice pleading requirements, the statement of claim must \"at least set forth minimal facts as to who did what to whom, when, where, and why.\" <i>Id.</i> at 68.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court recognized, Calvi's complaint offends these rudimentary principles insofar as her unpled claims are concerned. In her complaint, she alleges that \"with reckless and deliberate disregard for [her] rights,\" Smith \"physically abuse[d] her and treat[ed] her cruelly and callously, using force far in excess of that necessary under the circumstances, all in violation of her rights.\" This language is sufficient to plead an excessive force claim but not a false arrest claim. At no point in the complaint did Calvi say anything to place Smith on notice that she was claiming false arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Calvi's argument that her false arrest claim is implicit in her excessive force claim lacks merit. Other courts have held that an excessive force claim is not implicit in a false arrest claim but, rather, must be stated distinctly. <i>See, e.g., Bashir v. Rockdale County,</i> 445 F.3d 1323, 1331-32 (11th Cir.2006); <i>cf. Iacobucci v. Boulter,</i> 193 F.3d 14, 19 (1st Cir.1999) (recognizing that false arrest and excessive force are separate and distinct claims). We think that the reverse is equally true: a false arrest claim is not implicit in an excessive force claim but, rather, must be stated distinctly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Much the same is true of Calvi's nascent failure to intervene claims. Her complaint named McLaughlin and Gracie as defendants but limned only claims of excessive force against them. Neither a duty to intervene nor a breach of that duty was alluded to in any way, shape, or form. Calvi's argument rests, therefore, on the proposition that a failure to intervene claim is implicit in an excessive force claim directed at multiple defendants. We reject that proposition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of it is that, as the district court held, Calvi was not entitled to raise new and unadvertised theories of liability for the first time in opposition to a motion for summary judgment. <i>See Torres-Rios v. LPS Labs., Inc.,</i> 152 F.3d 11, 15-16 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">VI. CONCLUSION.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we uphold the district court's entry of judgment in the defendants' favor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Calvi also sued under the Maine Civil Rights Act, Me.Rev.Stat.

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pivotal facts are laid out in considerable detail in the recommended decision of the magistrate judge, <i>see Calvi v. City of Rockland,</i> Civ. No. 05-11, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">890687</span></span> (D.Me. Mar.31, 2006), and we assume the reader's familiarity with that decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 19, 2003, a 911 operator, reacting to a male caller (later identified as Matthew Hayden) who had locked himself in his room because a woman was brandishing a knife in his house, dispatched Officer Kenneth Smith of the Rockland police department to 89 Talbot Avenue, Rockland, Maine. Several people, most of them unrelated, lived at that address. Smith was familiar with the locus, having gone there the day before to settle a dispute between Calvi and another tenant, Kevin Warren.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dispatcher told Smith that Calvi had been identified as the knife-wielder. When Smith arrived at the residence, the landlord (Lawrence Frier) agreed to go inside and find Calvi. Around the same time, Warren&#8212;who had fled the scene&#8212;called the dispatcher and asked if it was safe to go back. Upon learning that the police were on the premises, he returned and played an audiotape for Smith. Warren told Smith that four people&#8212;he, Frier, Calvi, and Hayden&#8212;were present when the tape was made inside the dwelling. Apparently, Calvi had begun yelling at Warren because he \"made faces\" at her. When Warren (an alleged martial arts expert) approached Calvi, she snatched a butcher knife from the sinkboard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the tape, Calvi, obviously upset, could be heard launching a series of accusations at Warren. Frier could be heard imploring Calvi to be reasonable and, at one point, stating to her: \"Morgan, that's a felony.\" Warren eventually fled, and Hayden called the police.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the time that Frier located Calvi, another officer was at the scene. Calvi told Smith that she wanted to tell her side of the story. Smith, however, arrested her on the spot, charged her with criminal threatening with a dangerous weapon, <i>see</i> Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &#167; 209, and stated that she could relate her version later. Frier gave Calvi bail money and told Smith to be gentle because she was frail and had recently undergone elbow surgery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith placed Calvi in handcuffs and double-locked them behind her back so that they would not tighten. He then marched her outside, deposited her in his cruiser, and belted her in for transport to the Knox County jail. Smith's fellow officer, Sergeant Jeffrey McLaughlin, was at the scene but had no real interaction with Calvi; McLaughlin spent his time talking with Warren and Hayden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When handcuffing Calvi and assisting her into the back seat of the cruiser, Smith, who had been trained as a paramedic, did not observe any debilitating condition. He did notice, however, that Calvi was crying during the five-to-six-minute drive to the jail. All in all, Calvi was handcuffed for no more than fifteen minutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Calvi has several disabilities, the only one relevant here is a birth defect that required surgical straightening of three of the fingers on her left hand. Although this disability is painful, it has never prevented Calvi from doing routine activities such as dressing herself, feeding herself, or working at Wal-Mart.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon arriving at the lockup, Smith transferred custody of his prisoner to a Knox County correctional officer, Rebecca Gracie. Gracie unlocked the handcuffs, patted Calvi down, and placed her in a holding cell. After other required aspects of the booking process had been completed, another Knox County officer fingerprinted Calvi. Gracie was present during the fingerprinting but had no direct involvement with Calvi at that stage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Calvi claims that the officer who fingerprinted her repeatedly pushed her fingers down hard, in spite of being told that she had a hand deformity. She further claims that the fingerprinting caused injuries to her wrist and surgically repaired middle finger.

So viewed, a grant of summary judgment does not compromise the Seventh Amendment's jury trial right because that right exists only with respect to genuinely disputed issues of material fact. <i>See Harris v.

Me. R. 56(b). A related rule provides in pertinent part that \"[a] party opposing a motion for summary judgment shall submit with its opposition a separate, short, and concise statement of material facts [which] shall admit, deny or qualify the facts by reference to each numbered paragraph of the moving party's statement of material facts and unless a fact is admitted, shall support each denial or qualification by a record citation.\" <i>Id.</i> 56(c). Calvi asserts, without any citation to persuasive authority, that these rules are unconstitutional because they ensure a trial by paper that, in the final analysis, is no trial at all.

Such local rules are useful devices for focusing a district court's attention on what is&#8212;and what is not&#8212;genuinely controverted. Such rules are desirable in other ways as well. For one thing, they have the capacity to dispel the smokescreen behind which litigants with marginal or unwinnable cases often seek to hide. For another thing, they greatly reduce the possibility that the district court will fall victim to an ambush. <i>Cf. Stepanischen v. Merchants Despatch Transp.

Calvi has offered us no sound reason for revisiting these decisions. Consequently, we hold that D. Me.

This showing must take into account the reasonableness of the officer's actions, viewed from the perspective of a prototypical officer confronted with the same or similar circumstances. <i>Graham,</i> 490 U.S. at 396, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112257\"><a href=\"/opinion/112257/graham-v-connor/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

There is not a shred of evidence that McLaughlin had anything to do with Calvi's handcuffing. His mere presence at the scene, without more, does not by some mysterious alchemy render him legally responsible under section 1983 for the actions of a fellow officer. <i>See Gaudreault v. Municipality of Salem,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"554019\"><a href=\"/opinion/554019/robert-a-gaudreault-v-municipality-of-salem-massachusetts/\"><span class=\"volume\">923</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">203</span></a></span>, 207 n. 3 (1st Cir.1990).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case against Smith is slightly more robust&#8212;but not robust enough to fend off summary judgment. Smith was responding to news that a civilian had been brandishing a knife in a dangerous manner. Even if Smith knew that the knife-wielder, Calvi, had a hand deformity, there is no evidence that he applied any excessive force. Standard police practice called for cuffing an arrestee's hands behind her back and Smith's decision not to deviate from this practice was a judgment call, pure and simple. He handcuffed Calvi in the customary manner and kept her in handcuffs for no more than the time reasonably necessary to transport her to the lockup.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That is the end of the story. The totality of the circumstances affords no legally sufficient basis for a finding that Smith's handcuffing of Calvi represented a constitutionally proscribed use of excessive force. <i>Cf. Jackson v.

Accordingly, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment for Smith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to her claims against the two individual members of the Rockland police department, Calvi attempts to hold the City of Rockland responsible for the officers' alleged use of excessive force. She argues that Rockland should be held liable under section 1983 because it failed adequately to train its police force.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> This argument is unavailing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to an allegation of failure to train, liability ordinarily may be found \"where the municipality fails to provide adequate training notwithstanding an obvious likelihood that inadequate training will result in the violation of constitutional rights.\" <i>Whitfield v.

Showing that a single individual received inadequate training is insufficient for municipal liability to attach; the training program as a whole must be found faulty. <i>See City of Canton v.

The only record evidence is to the contrary: Rockland's officers must attend the Maine Criminal Justice Academy, and training in arresting individuals with physical disabilities is part of the Academy's core curriculum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not probe this point too deeply for&#8212;regardless of the training afforded or the lack of training&#8212;it is only when a governmental unit's employee inflicts a constitutional injury that the governmental unit can be held liable under section 1983. <i>See Evans v.

It follows that the inadequate training of a police officer cannot be a basis for municipal liability under section 1983 unless a constitutional injury has been inflicted by the officer or officers whose training was allegedly inferior. <i>See Young v. City of Prov. ex rel. Napolitano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789877\"><a href=\"/opinion/789877/leisa-young-in-her-capacity-as-administratrix-of-the-estate-of-cornel/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span>, 25-26 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this aspect of the matter. As explained above, Calvi has utterly failed to generate a trialworthy issue as to the use of excessive force in the handcuffing process by either Smith or McLaughlin. Since no Rockland police officer inflicted a constitutional injury on Calvi, she cannot hold the City liable under section 1983 for its officers' alleged lack of training.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The Knox Defendants.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Calvi claims that Knox County and its officers should be held liable because of excessive force used during booking (and, especially, during fingerprinting).

Instead, her excessive force claim is directed at Gracie (who, although a supervisory officer, was a mere observer of the fingerprinting). Absent evidence of participation, concerted action, or at least culpable knowledge, one officer cannot be held jointly liable under section 1983 for another officer's use of excessive force. <i>See, e.g., Gaudreault,</i> 923 F.2d at 207 n. 3; <i>see also Monell v.

THE UNPLED CLAIMS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is one more leg to our journey. Calvi objects to the district court's determination that she failed properly to plead certain claims (and, therefore, waived them). We turn now to that objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The essential facts are as follows. In her opposition to the defendants' motions for summary judgment, Calvi for the first time asserted a false arrest claim against Smith and failure to intervene claims against McLaughlin and Gracie. None of these newly minted claims had been articulated, or even vaguely insinuated, in Calvi's complaint. The magistrate judge deemed the claims waived, <i>Calvi,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">890687</span></span>, at *7, and the district judge agreed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Calvi argues, in effect, that the Civil Rules require only notice pleading, and that notice of the incident subsumes within it notice of any and all claims arising out of the described nucleus of operative facts. The first part of her premise is correct; this court has held that there are no heightened pleading standards for civil rights cases and that, therefore, notice pleading rules apply to such actions. <i>See Educadores Puertorrique&#241;os en Acci&#243;n v. Hern&#225;ndez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200999\"><a href=\"/opinion/200999/epa-v-hernandez/\"><span class=\"volume\">367</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">61</span></a></span>, 66-67 (1st Cir. 2004). Thus, a plaintiff's complaint need only contain \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" <i>Id.</i> at 66 (citing Fed. R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second part of Calvi's premise is incorrect. Notice pleading rules do not relieve a plaintiff of responsibility for identifying the nature of her claim. <i>See Gooley v. Mobil Oil Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"508719\"><a href=\"/opinion/508719/william-r-gooley-v-mobil-oil-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">851</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">513</span></a></span>, 514 (1st Cir.1988) (explaining that although the requirements of Rule 8(a)(2) are minimal, \"minimal requirements are not tantamount to nonexistent requirements\"). Consequently, the statement of claim must, at a bare minimum, \"give the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiff's claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\" <i>Educadores,</i> 367 F.3d at 66 (quoting <i>Conley v. Gibson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105573\"><a href=\"/opinion/105573/conley-v-gibson/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 47, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105573\"><a href=\"/opinion/105573/conley-v-gibson/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">99</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105573\"><a href=\"/opinion/105573/conley-v-gibson/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span> (1957)). This means that, in a civil rights action, as in any other civil action subject to notice pleading requirements, the statement of claim must \"at least set forth minimal facts as to who did what to whom, when, where, and why.\" <i>Id.</i> at 68.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court recognized, Calvi's complaint offends these rudimentary principles insofar as her unpled claims are concerned. In her complaint, she alleges that \"with reckless and deliberate disregard for [her] rights,\" Smith \"physically abuse[d] her and treat[ed] her cruelly and callously, using force far in excess of that necessary under the circumstances, all in violation of her rights.\" This language is sufficient to plead an excessive force claim but not a false arrest claim. At no point in the complaint did Calvi say anything to place Smith on notice that she was claiming false arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Calvi's argument that her false arrest claim is implicit in her excessive force claim lacks merit. Other courts have held that an excessive force claim is not implicit in a false arrest claim but, rather, must be stated distinctly. <i>See, e.g., Bashir v. Rockdale County,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"77293\"><a href=\"/opinion/77293/saleem-bashir-v-rockdale-county-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1323</span></a></span>, 1331-32 (11th Cir.2006); <i>cf. Iacobucci v. Boulter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198661\"><a href=\"/opinion/198661/iacobucci-v-town-of-pembroke/\"><span class=\"volume\">193</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 19 (1st Cir.1999) (recognizing that false arrest and excessive force are separate and distinct claims). We think that the reverse is equally true: a false arrest claim is not implicit in an excessive force claim but, rather, must be stated distinctly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Much the same is true of Calvi's nascent failure to intervene claims. Her complaint named McLaughlin and Gracie as defendants but limned only claims of excessive force against them. Neither a duty to intervene nor a breach of that duty was alluded to in any way, shape, or form. Calvi's argument rests, therefore, on the proposition that a failure to intervene claim is implicit in an excessive force claim directed at multiple defendants. We reject that proposition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of it is that, as the district court held, Calvi was not entitled to raise new and unadvertised theories of liability for the first time in opposition to a motion for summary judgment. <i>See Torres-Rios v. LPS Labs., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757018\"><a href=\"/opinion/757018/prodliabrep-cch-p-15303-ana-maria-torres-rios-v-lps-laboratories/\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 15-16 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">VI.

Here, however, Calvi did not timely charge McLaughlin with a failure to intervene. <i>See</i> Part V, <i>infra.</i></p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Calvi originally made a related argument: that the City had a policy or custom that led to the violation of her civil rights.
