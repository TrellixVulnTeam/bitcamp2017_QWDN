Gibson,* and Howard,\n                            Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Brailey E. Newton for appellant.\n     David C. Hamilton for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           November 17, 2009\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f     JOHN R. GIBSON, Circuit Judge.          This employment case, brought\n\nunder state law and removed to federal court, involves charges of\n\ndiscrimination,      retaliatory       harassment,        and   hostile      work\n\nenvironment pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 151B.\n\nThe district court entered summary judgment for the defendant,\n\nBarton Protective Services, Inc.             (“Barton Services”), and the\n\nclaims   against    the   individual    defendants    were      terminated     for\n\nfailure to serve them with process.           We affirm.\n\n\n\n                              I.   Background\n\n     Markdale Windross was a security officer employed by defendant\n\nBarton Services from September 2002 through July 9, 2003, when\n\nBarton Services terminated his employment.\n\n     On July 7, 2003, Windross was to undergo oral surgery, and he\n\nswitched    work   shifts   with   another     security    officer   to   do    so\n\nwithout first obtaining permission.             Barton Services’s handbook\n\nrequires that employees submit in writing a request to switch\n\nshifts   and    obtain    permission    from    a   supervisor.       Windross\n\nacknowledges that the handbook governs the workplace.                 The next\n\nday, Mark Ethridge, the Barton Services on-site account manager,\n\nissued a written disciplinary action against Windross for switching\n\nhis shift because it was a violation of Barton Services’s written\n\npolicies.      On that same day, Windross asked Jeremy Campbell, a\n\nsupervisor at Barton Services, for a copy of his personnel file.\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fCampbell informed Windross that he would need to obtain it from the\n\nBarton Services Human Resources Department.       Within the same\n\nconversation, Campbell swore at Windross and approached him in a\n\nphysically threatening manner.\n\n     On July 9, 2003, Windross went to speak with the acting\n\noperations manager, Christa Indorato, but was referred to Louise\n\nOrdman, the Human Resources Manager.   Windross alleges that Ordman\n\nconducted a number of discourtesies during his visit, so he refused\n\nto speak with her.   Ordman then told Windross to leave her office.\n\nWindross asked for the telephone number of the vice president,\n\nKevin Johnson, but Ordman told Windross that Johnson was away.\n\nWhen Windross arrived at work later that same day, Ethridge told\n\nhim that he was required to meet with Ordman.      Again, Windross\n\nrefused.   After Windross’s second refusal to meet with Ordman, he\n\nwas immediately suspended. Ordman telephoned Windross the next day\n\nand again demanded that he meet with her.   When he refused because\n\nof her hostile attitude, she told him she was terminating his\n\nemployment.   On July 21, Ordman sent Windross a letter formalizing\n\nhis dismissal.\n\n     On April 29, 2004, Windross filed a Charge of Discrimination\n\nwith the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination.   In his\n\nCharge, Windross alleged that he had been discriminated against by\n\nBarton Services.   Windross also alleged that Ethridge and Campbell\n\nhad retaliated against him.   On April 18, 2006, Windross filed a\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fmotion to amend the Charge to add a claim for hostile work\n\nenvironment.   On June 1, 2006, Windross filed a request with the\n\nMassachusetts Commission Against Discrimination to withdraw his\n\nCharge in order to file a lawsuit in state court.\n\n     Windross filed his Complaint in the present lawsuit in Suffolk\n\nCounty Superior Court on July 3, 2006. Barton Services removed the\n\ncase the following April, and Windross moved to have it remanded.\n\nOn July 10, 2007, the district court denied the motion to remand.\n\nTen days later, Windross moved to amend his complaint to add a\n\nclaim for hostile work environment, which the district court\n\ndenied.   The district court also terminated Ethridge and Campbell\n\nas defendants in this action after learning that Windross had\n\nfailed to serve either of them with process.     On June 18, 2008,\n\napproximately ten months after the district court denied his motion\n\nto amend, Windross filed a motion for reconsideration of his\n\noriginal motion to amend.   On August 20, 2008, the district court\n\ndenied the motion for reconsideration.   In spite of these rulings,\n\nWindross filed his Amended Complaint on November 7, 2008.      The\n\nAmended Complaint added one count for hostile work environment,\n\nwhich was the addition he sought in his motion to amend and motion\n\nfor reconsideration. Windross also inserted a handwritten sentence\n\nthat more directly stated a retaliation claim against Barton\n\nServices.   That sentence had not been included in his motion to\n\namend or for reconsideration.\n\n\n                                -4-\n\f     On appeal, Windross argues that the district court erred in\n\ngranting summary judgment to Barton Services.                  First, Windross\n\nrelies on the continuing violation doctrine in an attempt to revive\n\nhis time-barred claims.         Second, he argues that Barton Services’s\n\nreliance    on    shift-switching        as   the   basis      for    discipline,\n\nsuspension,      and   termination      was   pretextual    and      thus   summary\n\njudgment should not have been granted.                In addition, Windross\n\nasserts that the district court erred in denying his motion to\n\namend and motion for reconsideration.1\n\n\n\n                                 II.    Analysis\n\n                                A.     Timeliness\n\n     We first address Windross’s argument that the continuing\n\nviolation   doctrine      can   overcome      the   bar   of   the     statute   of\n\nlimitations.     Windross brought his claims under Massachusetts law,\n\nwhich requires a claimant to file a Charge of Discrimination with\n\nthe Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination within 300 days\n\nof the alleged discriminatory act.2           Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, § 5\n\n\n\n     1\n      Windross includes in his brief the district court’s decision\nnot to address his belated claim that Barton Services committed\nunlawful retaliation pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter\n151B. Because the claim of retaliation by Barton Services was not\nproperly raised in district court, we need not address this claim.\n     2\n      In 2002, the Massachusetts Legislature amended Massachusetts\nGeneral Laws chapter 151B, section 5, extending the limitations\nperiod from six months to 300 days. 2002 Mass. Legis. Serv. ch.\n223, § 1 (S.B. 915) (West).\n\n                                        -5-\n\f(2002).     Also, any lawsuit must be commenced within three years\n\nafter such act.          Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, § 9 (2002).                “By the\n\nplain language of the statute, the limitations period begins to run\n\nat   the    time    of    the    ‘act    of   discrimination.’”        Ocean    Spray\n\nCranberries, Inc. v. Massachusetts Comm’n Against Discrimination,\n\n808 N.E.2d 257, 265 (Mass. 2004).\n\n     In this case, neither party disputes that the applicable\n\nlimitations period pursuant to Massachusetts law is 300 days.\n\nWindross filed his Charge of Discrimination with the Massachusetts\n\nCommission Against Discrimination on April 29, 2004.                          Windross\n\nfiled his complaint in Suffolk County Superior Court on July 3,\n\n2006.      The statute of limitations bars Windross from filing a\n\nCharge arising out of events that occurred before July 4, 2003, and\n\nfrom bringing a civil action based on events that occurred before\n\nJuly 3, 2003.       Accordingly, the only timely claims are Windross’s\n\nallegations that he was discriminated against on July 8, 2003, when\n\nhe was disciplined for switching shifts and that Barton Services\n\ndiscriminated against him when he was suspended from employment on\n\nJuly 9, 2003 and subsequently terminated.\n\n     As     the    district     court    noted,     two    instances     of   alleged\n\ndiscrimination are barred by the statute of limitations.                         Both\n\noccurred on June 20, 2003, when a white employee received an acting\n\nsupervisory       position      over    Windross,    who    had   more   seniority,\n\nexperience, and training, and when Windross received a negative\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\femployment evaluation that included a comment that he “seems to\n\nwant to ‘champion’ the cause of perceived inequalities . . . and\n\ndoes not demonstrate trust in the supervisor . . . to handle issues\n\nappropriately.”\n\n       Windross, however, invokes the continuing violation doctrine\n\nin an effort to save from dismissal his claims of the earlier acts\n\nof discrimination. For the continuing violation doctrine to apply,\n\na plaintiff must prove that (1) at least one discriminatory act\n\noccurred within the limitations period, (2) the alleged timely\n\ndiscriminatory act has a substantial relationship to the alleged\n\nuntimely discriminatory act, and (3) the otherwise time-barred\n\nevents did not trigger his “awareness and duty” to assert his\n\nrights.      Ocean   Spray,   808    N.E.2d      at    266-67.      A   plaintiff’s\n\nawareness and duty is triggered when he “knew or could have formed\n\na   reasonable       belief   that        the     earlier        violations     were\n\ndiscriminatory.”      Id. at 267, n.16.\n\n       Windross’s attempt to invoke the continuing violation doctrine\n\nto rescue some of the claims from dismissal misses the mark because\n\nWindross     reasonably   believed        that        earlier    violations     were\n\ndiscriminatory.      Here, Windross stated in his deposition testimony\n\nthat    he   understood   that      he   was    being     discriminated       and/or\n\nretaliated against at the time each of the alleged time-barred acts\n\noccurred.    Accordingly, the district court did not err in holding\n\nthat the continuing violation doctrine is not available to Windross\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fto overcome his time-barred claims.                 See Williams v. Raytheon Co.,\n\n220 F.3d 16, 21 (1st Cir. 2000) (holding that continuing violation\n\ndoctrine “does not apply because [plaintiff] considered the act of\n\nwhich he complains discriminatory at the time”).\n\n\n\n                             B.   Discrimination Claim\n\n        We next address Windross’s claim that the district court\n\nerred in granting summary judgment because he presented no evidence\n\nof pretext.      We review grants of summary judgment de novo.                        In\n\nconducting that review, the court is bound to scrutinize the\n\nevidence in a light most agreeable to the nonmoving party, giving\n\nthat party the benefit of any and all reasonable inferences.                         Cox\n\nv.   Hainey,     391       F.3d   25,    27    (1st    Cir.      2004).      Employment\n\ndiscrimination claims brought under Massachusetts General Laws\n\nchapter   151B       are     reviewed     according        to    the    burden-shifting\n\nframework similar to that articulated by the United States Supreme\n\nCourt for Title VII cases in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411\n\nU.S. 792, 802 (1973).              Blare v. Huskey Injection Molding Sys.\n\nBoston, Inc., 646 N.E.2d 111, 114 (Mass. 1995).                           The plaintiff\n\nfirst   has    the     burden     of    showing,      by   a    preponderance   of   the\n\nevidence, a prima facie case of discrimination.                        Id. at 115.   The\n\nplaintiff establishes a prima facie case of race discrimination in\n\nconnection with his suspension and termination by showing (1) he is\n\na member of a protected class; (2) he performed his job at an\n\n\n                                              -8-\n\facceptable level; (3) he was terminated; and (4) that the employer\n\nfilled his position with another individual with qualifications\n\nsimilar to his own.        Id.    In response to the plaintiff’s prima\n\nfacie   case    for    discrimination,      the   employer     can   rebut     the\n\npresumption by articulating a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason\n\nfor its employment decision.         Wheelock College v. Massachusetts\n\nComm’n Against Discrimination, 355 N.E.2d 309, 313 (Mass. 1976).\n\n     Once the defendant articulates a nondiscriminatory reason for\n\nthe employment decision, the plaintiff must show by a preponderance\n\nof the evidence that the defendant’s reasons are pretextual or that\n\nthe defendant’s real motivation was discriminatory.                  Blare, 646\n\nN.E.2d at 117.        In order to show pretext, the plaintiff must be\n\nable to demonstrate that similarly-situated employees outside of\n\nhis protected class were treated differently.              Matthews v. Ocean\n\nSpray Cranberries, Inc., 686 N.E.2d 1303, 1309 (Mass. 1997).\n\nSummary judgment for the defendant is thus inappropriate if a\n\nplaintiff      has    offered    evidence     sufficient       to    support     a\n\ndetermination that the employer’s reason was pretextual.\n\n     The central question in determining this discrimination claim\n\nis whether Barton Services’s stated reason for Windross being\n\ndisciplined     and   later   suspended     and   terminated    following      his\n\nunilateral shift switch is pretextual.              The company’s asserted\n\nreason is that Windross refused to meet with Ordman.                   In other\n\nwords, we must determine if the employer’s statements concerning\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fWindross’s insubordination masked discrimination.                 The district\n\ncourt found that Windross’s disciplining for switching shifts was\n\nnot pretextual.        It is undisputed that switching shifts with\n\nanother security officer without first getting permission from a\n\nsupervisor is a violation of Barton Services’s policies.              Although\n\nthere is evidence to show that shift switching had occurred within\n\nthe organization, there is no evidence that other security officers\n\nwho failed to obtain permission before switching shifts were not\n\ndisciplined.       Accordingly, the disciplining of Windross was not a\n\npretext for discrimination.        See Matthews, 686 N.E.2d at 1309.\n\n      Likewise, Windross’s suspension and termination for refusing\n\nto   meet   with    Ordman’s    orders   were   not    pretextual.      Barton\n\nServices’s     written     company    policy    states     that     “[w]illful\n\nmisconduct,    including       insubordination”       provides    grounds   for\n\n“immediate termination.”        It was not up to Windross to decide if\n\nand when to meet with Ordman, and Windross does not deny that he\n\ntwice refused Ordman’s orders to speak with her.                 When Windross\n\nrefused to meet with Ordman for a second time, the company was\n\njustified in terminating Windross.          See Tate v. Dep’t of Mental\n\nHealth, 645 N.E.2d 1159, 1164 (Mass. 1995) (summary judgment\n\njustified when deaf social worker failed to establish pretext under\n\nTitle VII and Massachusetts General Laws chapter 151B when fired\n\nfor insubordination); see also Williams, 220 F.3d at 19 (summary\n\njudgment justified when male employee failed to establish case\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\funder Title VII when he was fired for insubordination); Holloway v.\n\nThompson Island Outward Bound Educ. Center Inc., 492 F. Supp. 2d\n\n20, 24-25 (D. Mass. 2007) (insubordination is a legitimate ground\n\nfor termination of an employee under Title VII).   Moreover, while\n\nthe record gives examples of Windross’s noting the misconduct of\n\nother employees, there is no evidence that other security officers\n\nwho twice failed to follow the similar directives of their managers\n\nwould not be disciplined as a result.   See Matthews, 686 N.E.2d at\n\n1309.   The district court did not err in its concluding that there\n\nwas no evidence of pretext in Windross’s disciplining, suspension,\n\nor termination. Thus, summary judgment in favor of Barton Services\n\nis appropriate.\n\n\n\n                        C.   Leave to Amend\n\n     Windross also contends that the district court erred when it\n\ndenied his motion to add a count for hostile work environment.   We\n\nreview the district court’s decision to deny a motion to amend\n\nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15 for abuse of discretion,\n\nand we will defer to the district court if any adequate reason for\n\nthe denial is apparent from the record.       Grant v. News Group\n\nBoston, Inc., 55 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1995).   As outlined above, a\n\ncomplainant is required to file his lawsuit within three years of\n\nthe alleged discriminatory act or acts giving rise to the claim.\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, § 9.\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\f     In this case, adequate reason for denial of Windross’s motion\n\nto amend and motion for reconsideration is apparent.            Windross did\n\nnot move to amend his complaint until July 20, 2007.               While we\n\nrecognize that Windross’s case was removed to federal court in\n\nApril 2007, the hostile work environment claim was, nonetheless,\n\nraised almost exactly four years after his employment with Barton\n\nwas terminated.    As a result, Windross’s hostile work environment\n\nclaim was time-barred and the district court thus acted within its\n\ndiscretion   in    denying   his    motion   to   amend   and   motion   for\n\nreconsideration.    See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, § 9.          The district\n\ncourt did not err in denying Windross’s motion to amend and motion\n\nfor reconsideration.\n\n\n\n                             III.   Conclusion\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court’s\n\ngrant of summary judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\f",

The district court entered summary judgment for the defendant, Barton Protective Services, Inc. (\"Barton Services\"), and the claims against the individual defendants were terminated for failure to serve them with process. We affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Background</h2>\n<p>Markdale Windross was a security officer employed by defendant Barton Services from September 2002 through July 9, 2003, when Barton Services terminated his employment.</p>\n<p>On July 7, 2003, Windross was to undergo oral surgery, and he switched work shifts with another security officer to do so without first obtaining permission. Barton Services's handbook requires that employees submit in writing a request to switch shifts and obtain permission from a supervisor. Windross acknowledges that the handbook governs the workplace. The next day, Mark Ethridge, the Barton Services on-site account manager, issued a written disciplinary action against Windross for switching his shift because it was a violation of Barton Services's written policies. On that same day, Windross asked Jeremy Campbell, a supervisor at Barton Services, for a copy of his personnel file. Campbell informed Windross that he would need to obtain it from the Barton Services Human Resources Department. Within the same conversation, Campbell swore at Windross and approached him in a physically threatening manner.</p>\n<p>On July 9, 2003, Windross went to speak with the acting operations manager, Christa Indorato, but was referred to Louise Ordman, the Human Resources Manager. Windross alleges that Ordman conducted a number of discourtesies during his visit, so he refused to speak with her. Ordman then told Windross to leave her office. Windross asked for the telephone number of the vice president, Kevin Johnson, but Ordman told Windross that Johnson was away. When Windross arrived at work later that same day, Ethridge told him that he was required to meet with Ordman. Again, Windross refused. After Windross's second refusal to meet with Ordman, he was immediately suspended. Ordman telephoned Windross the next day and again demanded that he meet with her. When he refused because of her hostile attitude, she told him she was terminating his employment. On July 21, Ordman sent Windross a letter formalizing his dismissal.</p>\n<p>On April 29, 2004, Windross filed a Charge of Discrimination with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination. In his Charge, Windross alleged that he had been discriminated against by Barton Services. Windross also alleged that Ethridge and Campbell had retaliated against him. On April 18, 2006, Windross filed a motion to amend the Charge to add a claim for hostile work environment. On June 1, 2006, Windross filed a request with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination to withdraw his Charge in order to file a lawsuit in state court.</p>\n<p>Windross filed his Complaint in the present lawsuit in Suffolk County Superior Court on July 3, 2006. Barton Services removed the case the following April, and Windross moved to have it remanded. On July 10, 2007, the district court denied the motion to remand. Ten days later, Windross moved to amend his complaint to add a claim for hostile work environment, which the district court denied. The district court also terminated Ethridge and Campbell as defendants in this action after learning that Windross had failed to serve either of them with process. On June 18, 2008, approximately ten months after the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*102</span> district court denied his motion to amend, Windross filed a motion for reconsideration of his original motion to amend. On August 20, 2008, the district court denied the motion for reconsideration. In spite of these rulings, Windross filed his Amended Complaint on November 7, 2008. The Amended Complaint added one count for hostile work environment, which was the addition he sought in his motion to amend and motion for reconsideration. Windross also inserted a handwritten sentence that more directly stated a retaliation claim against Barton Services. That sentence had not been included in his motion to amend or for reconsideration.</p>\n<p>On appeal, Windross argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to Barton Services. First, Windross relies on the continuing violation doctrine in an attempt to revive his time-barred claims. Second, he argues that Barton Services's reliance on shift-switching as the basis for discipline, suspension, and termination was pretextual and thus summary judgment should not have been granted. In addition, Windross asserts that the district court erred in denying his motion to amend and motion for reconsideration.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. Analysis</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Timeliness</h2>\n<p>We first address Windross's argument that the continuing violation doctrine can overcome the bar of the statute of limitations. Windross brought his claims under Massachusetts law, which requires a claimant to file a Charge of Discrimination with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination within 300 days of the alleged discriminatory act.<sup>[2]</sup> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, § 5 (2002). Also, any lawsuit must be commenced within three years after such act. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, § 9 (2002). \"By the plain language of the statute, the limitations period begins to run at the time of the `act of discrimination.'\" <i>Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc. v. Massachusetts Comm'n Against Discrimination,</i> 441 Mass. 632, 808 N.E.2d 257, 265 (2004).</p>\n<p>In this case, neither party disputes that the applicable limitations period pursuant to Massachusetts law is 300 days. Windross filed his Charge of Discrimination with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination on April 29, 2004. Windross filed his complaint in Suffolk County Superior Court on July 3, 2006. The statute of limitations bars Windross from filing a Charge arising out of events that occurred before July 4, 2003, and from bringing a civil action based on events that occurred before July 3, 2003. Accordingly, the only timely claims are Windross's allegations that he was discriminated against on July 8, 2003, when he was disciplined for switching shifts and that Barton Services discriminated against him when he was suspended from employment on July 9, 2003 and subsequently terminated.</p>\n<p>As the district court noted, two instances of alleged discrimination are barred by the statute of limitations. Both occurred on June 20, 2003, when a white employee <span class=\"star-pagination\">*103</span> received an acting supervisory position over Windross, who had more seniority, experience, and training, and when Windross received a negative employment evaluation that included a comment that he \"seems to want to `champion' the cause of perceived inequalities . . . and does not demonstrate trust in the supervisor . . . to handle issues appropriately.\"</p>\n<p>Windross, however, invokes the continuing violation doctrine in an effort to save from dismissal his claims of the earlier acts of discrimination. For the continuing violation doctrine to apply, a plaintiff must prove that (1) at least one discriminatory act occurred within the limitations period, (2) the alleged timely discriminatory act has a substantial relationship to the alleged untimely discriminatory act, and (3) the otherwise time-barred events did not trigger his \"awareness and duty\" to assert his rights. <i>Ocean Spray,</i> 808 N.E.2d at 266-67. A plaintiff's awareness and duty is triggered when he \"knew or could have formed a reasonable belief that the earlier violations were discriminatory.\" <i>Id.</i> at 267, n. 16.</p>\n<p>Windross's attempt to invoke the continuing violation doctrine to rescue some of the claims from dismissal misses the mark because Windross reasonably believed that earlier violations were discriminatory. Here, Windross stated in his deposition testimony that he understood that he was being discriminated and/or retaliated against at the time each of the alleged time-barred acts occurred. Accordingly, the district court did not err in holding that the continuing violation doctrine is not available to Windross to overcome his time-barred claims. <i>See </i><i>Williams v. Raytheon Co.,</i> 220 F.3d 16, 21 (1st Cir.2000) (holding that continuing violation doctrine \"does not apply because [plaintiff] considered the act of which he complains discriminatory at the time\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Discrimination Claim</h2>\n<p>We next address Windross's claim that the district court erred in granting summary judgment because he presented no evidence of pretext. We review grants of summary judgment <i>de novo.</i> In conducting that review, the court is bound to scrutinize the evidence in a light most agreeable to the nonmoving party, giving that party the benefit of any and all reasonable inferences. <i>Cox v. Hainey,</i> 391 F.3d 25, 27 (1st Cir.2004). Employment discrimination claims brought under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 151B are reviewed according to the burden-shifting framework similar to that articulated by the United States Supreme Court for Title VII cases in <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</i> 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <i>Blare v. Husky Injection Molding Sys. Boston, Inc.,</i> 419 Mass. 437, 646 N.E.2d 111, 114 (1995). The plaintiff first has the burden of showing, by a preponderance of the evidence, a prima facie case of discrimination. <i>Id.</i> at 115. The plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of race discrimination in connection with his suspension and termination by showing (1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he performed his job at an acceptable level; (3) he was terminated; and (4) that the employer filled his position with another individual with qualifications similar to his own. <i>Id.</i> In response to the plaintiff's prima facie case for discrimination, the employer can rebut the presumption by articulating a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its employment decision. <i>Wheelock College v. Massachusetts Comm'n Against Discrimination,</i> 371 Mass. 130, 355 N.E.2d 309, 313 (1976).</p>\n<p>Once the defendant articulates a nondiscriminatory reason for the employment decision, the plaintiff must show by a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*104</span> preponderance of the evidence that the defendant's reasons are pretextual or that the defendant's real motivation was discriminatory. <i>Blare,</i> 646 N.E.2d at 117. In order to show pretext, the plaintiff must be able to demonstrate that similarly-situated employees outside of his protected class were treated differently. <i>Matthews v. Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc.,</i> 426 Mass. 122, 686 N.E.2d 1303, 1309 (1997). Summary judgment for the defendant is thus inappropriate if a plaintiff has offered evidence sufficient to support a determination that the employer's reason was pretextual.</p>\n<p>The central question in determining this discrimination claim is whether Barton Services's stated reason for Windross being disciplined and later suspended and terminated following his unilateral shift switch is pretextual. The company's asserted reason is that Windross refused to meet with Ordman. In other words, we must determine if the employer's statements concerning Windross's insubordination masked discrimination. The district court found that Windross's disciplining for switching shifts was not pretextual. It is undisputed that switching shifts with another security officer without first getting permission from a supervisor is a violation of Barton Services's policies. Although there is evidence to show that shift switching had occurred within the organization, there is no evidence that other security officers who failed to obtain permission before switching shifts were not disciplined. Accordingly, the disciplining of Windross was not a pretext for discrimination. <i>See </i><i>Matthews,</i> 686 N.E.2d at 1309.</p>\n<p>Likewise, Windross's suspension and termination for refusing to meet with Ordman's orders were not pretextual. Barton Services's written company policy states that \"[w]illful misconduct, including insubordination\" provides grounds for \"immediate termination.\" It was not up to Windross to decide if and when to meet with Ordman, and Windross does not deny that he twice refused Ordman's orders to speak with her. When Windross refused to meet with Ordman for a second time, the company was justified in terminating Windross. <i>See </i><i>Tate v. Dep't of Mental Health,</i> 419 Mass. 356, 645 N.E.2d 1159, 1164 (1995) (summary judgment justified when deaf social worker failed to establish pretext under Title VII and Massachusetts General Laws chapter 151B when fired for insubordination); <i>see also </i><i>Williams,</i> 220 F.3d at 19 (summary judgment justified when male employee failed to establish case under Title VII when he was fired for insubordination); <i>Holloway v. Thompson Island Outward Bound Educ. Center Inc.,</i> 492 F.Supp.2d 20, 24-25 (D.Mass.2007) (insubordination is a legitimate ground for termination of an employee under Title VII). Moreover, while the record gives examples of Windross's noting the misconduct of other employees, there is no evidence that other security officers who twice failed to follow the similar directives of their managers would not be disciplined as a result. <i>See </i><i>Matthews,</i> 686 N.E.2d at 1309. The district court did not err in its concluding that there was no evidence of pretext in Windross's disciplining, suspension, or termination. Thus, summary judgment in favor of Barton Services is appropriate.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Leave to Amend</h2>\n<p>Windross also contends that the district court erred when it denied his motion to add a count for hostile work environment. We review the district court's decision to deny a motion to amend under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15 for abuse of discretion, and we will defer to the district court if any adequate reason for the denial is apparent from the record. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*105</span> <i>Grant v. News Group Boston, Inc.,</i> 55 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1995). As outlined above, a complainant is required to file his lawsuit within three years of the alleged discriminatory act or acts giving rise to the claim. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, § 9.</p>\n<p>In this case, adequate reason for denial of Windross's motion to amend and motion for reconsideration is apparent. Windross did not move to amend his complaint until July 20, 2007. While we recognize that Windross's case was removed to federal court in April 2007, the hostile work environment claim was, nonetheless, raised almost exactly four years after his employment with Barton was terminated. As a result, Windross's hostile work environment claim was time-barred and the district court thus acted within its discretion in denying his motion to amend and motion for reconsideration. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, § 9. The district court did not err in denying Windross's motion to amend and motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Windross includes in his brief the district court's decision not to address his belated claim that Barton Services committed unlawful retaliation pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 151B.

The district court entered summary judgment for the defendant, Barton Protective Services, Inc. (\"Barton Services\"), and the claims against the individual defendants were terminated for failure to serve them with process. We affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Background</h2>\n<p>Markdale Windross was a security officer employed by defendant Barton Services from September 2002 through July 9, 2003, when Barton Services terminated his employment.</p>\n<p>On July 7, 2003, Windross was to undergo oral surgery, and he switched work shifts with another security officer to do so without first obtaining permission. Barton Services's handbook requires that employees submit in writing a request to switch shifts and obtain permission from a supervisor. Windross acknowledges that the handbook governs the workplace. The next day, Mark Ethridge, the Barton Services on-site account manager, issued a written disciplinary action against Windross for switching his shift because it was a violation of Barton Services's written policies. On that same day, Windross asked Jeremy Campbell, a supervisor at Barton Services, for a copy of his personnel file. Campbell informed Windross that he would need to obtain it from the Barton Services Human Resources Department. Within the same conversation, Campbell swore at Windross and approached him in a physically threatening manner.</p>\n<p>On July 9, 2003, Windross went to speak with the acting operations manager, Christa Indorato, but was referred to Louise Ordman, the Human Resources Manager. Windross alleges that Ordman conducted a number of discourtesies during his visit, so he refused to speak with her. Ordman then told Windross to leave her office. Windross asked for the telephone number of the vice president, Kevin Johnson, but Ordman told Windross that Johnson was away. When Windross arrived at work later that same day, Ethridge told him that he was required to meet with Ordman. Again, Windross refused. After Windross's second refusal to meet with Ordman, he was immediately suspended. Ordman telephoned Windross the next day and again demanded that he meet with her. When he refused because of her hostile attitude, she told him she was terminating his employment. On July 21, Ordman sent Windross a letter formalizing his dismissal.</p>\n<p>On April 29, 2004, Windross filed a Charge of Discrimination with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination. In his Charge, Windross alleged that he had been discriminated against by Barton Services. Windross also alleged that Ethridge and Campbell had retaliated against him. On April 18, 2006, Windross filed a motion to amend the Charge to add a claim for hostile work environment. On June 1, 2006, Windross filed a request with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination to withdraw his Charge in order to file a lawsuit in state court.</p>\n<p>Windross filed his Complaint in the present lawsuit in Suffolk County Superior Court on July 3, 2006. Barton Services removed the case the following April, and Windross moved to have it remanded. On July 10, 2007, the district court denied the motion to remand. Ten days later, Windross moved to amend his complaint to add a claim for hostile work environment, which the district court denied.

On June 18, 2008, approximately ten months after the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*102</span> district court denied his motion to amend, Windross filed a motion for reconsideration of his original motion to amend. On August 20, 2008, the district court denied the motion for reconsideration. In spite of these rulings, Windross filed his Amended Complaint on November 7, 2008. The Amended Complaint added one count for hostile work environment, which was the addition he sought in his motion to amend and motion for reconsideration.

Moreover, while the record gives examples of Windross's noting the misconduct of other employees, there is no evidence that other security officers who twice failed to follow the similar directives of their managers would not be disciplined as a result. <i>See </i><i>Matthews,</i> 686 N.E.2d at 1309. The district court did not err in its concluding that there was no evidence of pretext in Windross's disciplining, suspension, or termination. Thus, summary judgment in favor of Barton Services is appropriate.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Leave to Amend</h2>\n<p>Windross also contends that the district court erred when it denied his motion to add a count for hostile work environment. We review the district court's decision to deny a motion to amend under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15 for abuse of discretion, and we will defer to the district court if any adequate reason for the denial is apparent from the record. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*105</span> <i>Grant v. News Group Boston, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 5 (1st Cir.1995). As outlined above, a complainant is required to file his lawsuit within three years of the alleged discriminatory act or acts giving rise to the claim. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, § 9.</p>\n<p>In this case, adequate reason for denial of Windross's motion to amend and motion for reconsideration is apparent. Windross did not move to amend his complaint until July 20, 2007. While we recognize that Windross's case was removed to federal court in April 2007, the hostile work environment claim was, nonetheless, raised almost exactly four years after his employment with Barton was terminated. As a result, Windross's hostile work environment claim was time-barred and the district court thus acted within its discretion in denying his motion to amend and motion for reconsideration. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, § 9. The district court did not err in denying Windross's motion to amend and motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Windross includes in his brief the district court's decision not to address his belated claim that Barton Services committed unlawful retaliation pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 151B. Because the claim of retaliation by Barton Services was not properly raised in district court, we need not address this claim.</p>\n<p>[2]  In 2002, the Massachusetts Legislature amended Massachusetts General Laws chapter 151B, section 5, extending the limitations period from six months to 300 days. 2002 Mass. Legis. Serv. ch. 223, § 1 (S.B. 915) (West).</p>\n\n</div>",
