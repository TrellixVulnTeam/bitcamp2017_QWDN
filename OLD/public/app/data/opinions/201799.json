The petitioner, Artur Harutyunyan,\n\na native of Armenia, seeks review of a final order of the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals (BIA) denying his application for asylum.1\n\nConcluding,       as    we   do,   that    the   BIA's   order   is   supported   by\n\nsubstantial evidence, we deny the petition.\n\n                The facts are uncomplicated.              In June of 2001, the\n\npetitioner, then twenty years old, entered the United States under\n\na J-1 visa to embark upon a work-study program.                        Having been\n\nlawfully admitted, he proceeded (again, lawfully) to acquire B-2\n\nvisitor status, which entitled him to remain until April 10, 2002.\n\n                The petitioner overstayed his departure deadline and, in\n\nJune       of   2002,    applied     for    asylum.        The   Immigration      and\n\nNaturalization          Service    responded      by     instituting    a   removal\n\nproceeding.        The petitioner conceded removability.\n\n                At an ensuing hearing, an immigration judge (IJ) examined\n\nthe petitioner's asylum application and the supporting documents\n\nsubmitted therewith (including the affidavit of an expert in\n\nArmenian politics and the 2002 State Department country report on\n\nhuman rights practices in Armenia).               These exhibits showed      a long\n\nhistory of conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Those historic\n\n\n\n       1\n      The petitioner originally sought withholding of removal as\nwell as asylum. The IJ and the BIA ruled against him with respect\nto both claims. In this venue, the petitioner disputes only the\nadverse ruling on asylum. His claim for withholding of removal is,\ntherefore, waived. See Makhoul v. Ashcroft, 387 F.3d 75, 82 (1st\nCir. 2004).\n\n                                           -2-\n\fproblems were exacerbated by a war that raged from 1988 to 1994.\n\nDuring the war, both Armenians residing in Azerbaijan and Azeris\n\nresiding   in    Armenia     were     confronted     with   varying   degrees    of\n\nviolence and discrimination.             As a result, many of the Azeris who\n\nhad resided in Armenia — upwards of 185,000 individuals — fled to\n\nAzerbaijan.          These   ethnic      tensions    were   heightened   in    1998\n\nfollowing the election of a self-proclaimed chauvinist, Robert\n\nKocharian,      as    president     of    Armenia.      Notwithstanding       these\n\ntensions, a few people of Azeri origin continue to reside in\n\nArmenia.\n\n           The petitioner testified against this general background.\n\nIn his testimony, he noted that his mother is from Azerbaijan.\n\nBuilding on that foundation, he alleged that, in early 2001, he\n\nbegan experiencing attacks upon his person and assaults upon his\n\nfinancial well-being due to his Azeri ethnicity.                      He further\n\nalleged that these intrusions constituted ethnic persecution.\n\n           The petitioner mentioned three specific events.                      In\n\nJanuary of 2001, a group of men spouting anti-Azeri ethnic slurs\n\nassaulted him.        The men told him that he did not have a right to\n\nlive in Armenia.         This assault occurred in Yerevan (where the\n\npetitioner lived).       The petitioner responded to it by altering his\n\ndaily routine; he left home earlier in the morning to travel to\n\nclass and he returned from work later at night in order to avoid\n\nunwanted confrontations.\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\f           All was well until an evening in March, when a group of\n\nmen accosted the petitioner and struck him with knives and sticks.\n\nThe marauders told him that he had been forewarned that violence\n\nwould occur unless he and his Azeri relatives left Armenia.          This\n\ntime, the petitioner suffered significant injuries, which required\n\na two-day hospital stay.\n\n           This incident prompted the petitioner's family to move to\n\ntheir summer home in rural Ashtarakh, approximately fifteen miles\n\nfrom Yerevan, in hopes of avoiding future trouble.        The petitioner\n\nresided there from March until June of 2001 and regularly attended\n\nschool.    He experienced no further acts of violence against his\n\nperson.    On April 24, 2001, however, arsonists burned down his\n\nstore in Yerevan.    The petitioner testified that the same nucleus\n\nof individuals who had been involved in the two prior assaults also\n\nwere involved in the arson.\n\n           The petitioner contemporaneously reported each of these\n\nincidents to the police.     The incidents were all investigated; one\n\ncase was closed for lack of evidence; and nothing has yet been\n\nresolved   in   connection   with   the   other   two   incidents.    The\n\npetitioner attributes this state of affairs to an unwillingness to\n\nprosecute based on his Azeri ethnicity. He concedes, however, that\n\nthe police responded promptly to the news of the first incident,\n\ninvestigated it, filed a report, and told the petitioner that they\n\nwould seek to find the miscreants and bring them to justice.           He\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\falso concedes that, following the second incident, the police again\n\nresponded promptly, interviewed the petitioner in his hospital\n\nroom,    tracked   down   the    perpetrators,      and    initiated   criminal\n\nproceedings against them.        These proceedings were pending when the\n\npetitioner absconded.          Criminal proceedings also were initiated\n\nagainst the persons accused of committing the arson.\n\n            The arson proved to be the last straw for several of the\n\npetitioner's relatives. His brother and sister-in-law emigrated to\n\nGeorgia and his parents moved to Russia.                 The petitioner claims\n\nthat he was unable to accompany either set of relatives because he\n\nhad not yet fulfilled Armenia's requirement for military service\n\n(and, thus, could not obtain an exit stamp).2                   The petitioner\n\nfurther testified that he could not meet his military service\n\nobligation    because     he    would   be    murdered    by   anti-Azeri   army\n\nofficers.    Faced with this Hobson's choice, the petitioner fled to\n\nthe United States.\n\n            The IJ found the petitioner's testimony credible as to\n\nthe raw facts, but nevertheless denied the application for asylum.\n\nIn the IJ's view, the incidents that the petitioner described did\n\nnot amount to past persecution.3             The IJ also determined that the\n\n\n     2\n      It is undisputed that Armenian citizens who wish permanently\nto relocate outside of Armenia must obtain such an exit stamp.\n     3\n      The parties' briefs indicate that the IJ determined that past\npersecution did occur. This interpretation is flawed. While the\nIJ stated preliminarily that the described acts \"can\" be deemed to\nbe past persecution, she ultimately concluded that \"the harm being\n\n                                        -5-\n\fpetitioner had failed to demonstrate a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution. The BIA upheld the IJ's decision without authoring an\n\nindependent opinion.   This petition for judicial review followed.4\n\nWe have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b).\n\n           When the BIA summarily affirms, this court reviews the\n\nIJ's decision \"as if it were the decision of the BIA.\"     Olujoke v.\n\nGonzáles, 411 F.3d 16, 21 (1st Cir. 2005).     Consequently, we focus\n\nthe lens of our inquiry on the IJ's asylum determination.         We\n\nemploy the highly deferential \"substantial evidence\" standard of\n\nreview.   See Rodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft, 398 F.3d 120, 123 (1st\n\nCir. 2005); Makhoul v. Ashcroft, 387 F.3d 75, 79 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nThis means that the IJ's findings of fact must stand \"unless any\n\nreasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the\n\ncontrary.\"   8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B).\n\n           In order to establish eligibility for asylum, an alien\n\nfirst must demonstrate that he is a refugee.    See id. § 1158(b)(1);\n\n8 C.F.R. § 208.13(a); see also Makhoul, 387 F.3d at 79.           An\n\nimmigrant is considered a refugee when he or she \"is unable or\n\nunwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself\n\nor herself of the protection of, [the native] country because of\n\n\ninvestigated by the authorities does not appear to constitute\npersecution.\"\n     4\n      Alberto R. Gonzales was sworn in as United States Attorney\nGeneral on February 3, 2005.      We have therefore substituted\nAttorney General Gonzales as the respondent in this matter. See\nFed. R. App. P. 43(c)(2).\n\n                                -6-\n\fpersecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of\n\nrace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social\n\ngroup, or political opinion.\"            8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A).             To\n\nattain refugee status, therefore, an asylum applicant must satisfy\n\ntwo fundamental criteria:         he must (i) qualify under one of the\n\nfive protected grounds enumerated above and (ii) connect that\n\nground to a well-founded fear of future persecution.                See 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 208.13; see also Da Silva v. Ashcroft, 394 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).\n\n            Here, the petitioner claims that he experienced bodily\n\ninjury and property damage due to his Azeri ethnicity.                         That\n\nallegation, on its face, satisfies the \"protected ground\" element.\n\nStill, it is not enough for an asylum applicant to show that he has\n\nsuffered harm on account of a protected ground; he also must\n\nsatisfy the \"well-founded fear\" requirement.                 This entails either\n\n(i) a showing of past persecution (which establishes a rebuttable\n\npresumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution) or (ii)\n\nindependent proof of a well-founded fear of future persecution.\n\nSee Da Silva, 394 F.3d at 4.              Either route requires that the\n\napplicant   forge   a     link   between      the    harm    asserted    and   some\n\ngovernmental act or omission.           See id. at 7; Thomas v. Ashcroft,\n\n359 F.3d 1169, 1179 (9th Cir. 2004).\n\n            Here,   the    IJ    held    that       the     petitioner   had   not\n\nsuccessfully traveled either route.            In so holding, she emphasized\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fthat the petitioner's antagonists were not government actors, that\n\nthe Armenian government was responsive to and protective of Azeris\n\nduring the relevant time frame, that the violence of which the\n\npetitioner complained was localized in nature, that the petitioner\n\ncould return to Armenia free of an objectively reasonable fear of\n\nfuture attacks, and that his Azeri heritage posed no special danger\n\nin connection with future service in the Armenian military.\n\n           Against    this    mise-en-scène,        we   first    address     the\n\npetitioner's claim of past persecution.             This claim rests on the\n\nthree   incidents    recounted   above.        Because    the    IJ   found   the\n\npetitioner credible, we accept that those incidents occurred as\n\ndescribed.\n\n           Importantly,      however,   the    IJ   found   that      all   three\n\nincidents involved the same nucleus of individuals, under the\n\nhegemony of a single ringleader, and that the authorities responded\n\nappropriately on each occasion.         These findings are supported by\n\nsubstantial evidence in the record.        Indeed, they are supported by\n\nthe petitioner's own testimony.         These facts, in turn, adequately\n\nground the IJ's ultimate conclusion that the three incidents did\n\nnot add up to a showing of past persecution.\n\n           It is apodictic that, for asylum purposes, \"not all\n\nhorrific   experiences    translate     into   persecution.\"          Rodriguez-\n\nRamirez, 398 F.3d at 124.        The incidents recounted here do not\n\ncompel a finding of past persecution.          The basic reason is that the\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fpetitioner has not sufficiently connected them to the Armenian\n\ngovernment.\n\n              Although persecution is a term of art that lacks precise\n\ndefinition in the immigration context, Negeya v. Gonzales, ___ F.3d\n\n___, ___ (1st Cir. 2005) [No. 04-1983, slip op. at 8],                   persecution\n\nalways implies some connection to government action or inaction.\n\nSee Roman v. INS, 233 F.3d 1027, 1034 (7th Cir. 2000).                       This link\n\nmay    be   forged    in    one   of   three      ways:     (i)   by   evidence     that\n\ngovernment actors committed or instigated the acts complained of;\n\n(ii) by evidence that government actors condoned the acts; or (iii)\n\nby evidence of an inability on the part of the government to\n\nprevent the acts.          See id. (citing Galina v. INS, 213 F.3d 955, 958\n\n(7th Cir. 2000)).           In other words, the necessary connection may\n\nmanifest      itself       in   the    execution     of     the   persecuting       acts\n\nthemselves, in the condonation of those acts, or in an inability to\n\nprevent them.        See Berishaj v. Ashcroft, 378 F.3d 314, 323 (3d Cir.\n\n2004) (explaining that past persecution requires a showing either\n\nthat    the   acts    were      committed    by    the    government    or   that    the\n\ngovernment was unable or unwilling to control them); Bartesaghi-Lay\n\nv. INS, 9 F.3d 819, 822 (10th Cir. 1993) (similar); see also Da\n\nSilva, 394 F.3d at 7 (\"Action by non-governmental actors can\n\nundergird a claim of persecution only if there is some showing that\n\nthe alleged persecutors are in league with the government or are\n\nnot controllable by the government.\").                    The record here does not\n\n\n                                            -9-\n\fcompel a finding that any such governmental connection existed with\n\nrespect to the incidents of which the petitioner complains.\n\n            The   most   telling    datum   is    that   (as   the   petitioner\n\nadmitted) the local authorities responded immediately to each\n\nincident.    Following the initial brouhaha, the police \"promised\n\n[the petitioner] that they [would] definitely find and bring to\n\njustice   [the]   people   who     beat   [him]   up.\"     After     the   second\n\nincident, the police succeeded in tracking down the malefactors and\n\ninitiated criminal proceedings against them.              And when the arson\n\noccurred, the police commenced an investigation, identified the\n\nalleged ringleader, and again instituted criminal proceedings.\n\n            To be sure, the petitioner complains that these endeavors\n\ndid not pan out more favorably because of his Azeri ethnicity.               But\n\nthat complaint is woven entirely out of the gossamer strands of\n\nspeculation and surmise.      From aught that appears, the authorities\n\nmade strong efforts to bring those responsible to justice and the\n\nabsence of any convictions may have had more than a little to do\n\nwith the fact that the petitioner — presumably the government's\n\nstar witness — fled the jurisdiction.\n\n            To cinch matters, the petitioner experienced no violence\n\nwhile residing at his family's summer home.              The IJ rejected the\n\npetitioner's proffered explanation for that phenomenon — that he\n\nwas \"in hiding\" — because the petitioner, during his stay in\n\nAshtarakh, made frequent public appearances, attended classes, and\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fsat for final examinations at the university.                             Noting that the\n\nincidents were confined to a particular area (Yerevan), the IJ\n\nsupportably found that the violence was localized and carried out\n\nsolely by a small band of local hoodlums.                         That is significant\n\nbecause      a    finding       that   violence        is      localized         supports     a\n\ndetermination that the violence does not constitute persecution.\n\nSee Galicia v. Ashcroft, 396 F.3d 446, 448 (1st Cir. 2005); Da\n\nSilva, 394 F.3d at 7.\n\n             In sum, the IJ concluded that the incidents affecting the\n\npetitioner,       though       regrettable,      did     not    as    a    matter     of    law\n\nconstitute persecution at the hands of government officials, but,\n\nrather, abuse at the hands of a coterie of local hooligans.                               Given\n\nthe   lack       of    any    connection    between         the      incidents      and     any\n\ndiscernible           governmental     action     or     inaction,          we    deem     this\n\nconclusion supported by substantial evidence.                          Consequently, we\n\nmust uphold it.              See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481\n\n(1992).\n\n             The        supportability      of     the      \"no      past        persecution\"\n\ndetermination brings us to the existence vel non of a well-founded\n\nfear of future persecution.            On that issue, as on the issue of past\n\npersecution, the petitioner bears the burden of proof. See Negeya,\n\n___ F.3d at ___ [slip op. at 6].                  Because there is no sufficient\n\nshowing of past persecution, the petitioner must carry that burden\n\nunaided by any affirmative presumption.                  Id. at __ [slip op. at 6].\n\n\n                                           -11-\n\f              A successful showing of a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution must survive scrutiny from both subjective (genuine\n\nfear) and objective (objectively reasonable fear) standpoints. See\n\nid. at ___ [slip op. at 6]; Laurent v. Ashcroft, 359 F.3d 59, 65\n\n(1st       Cir.     2004).          Given     the    IJ's     favorable        credibility\n\ndetermination,           the   petitioner        easily    satisfies     the    subjective\n\ncomponent of this test.               The objective component presents a more\n\ndaunting challenge.\n\n              The petitioner rests his fear of future persecution\n\nprincipally on the fact that he will have to undergo compulsory\n\nmilitary service should he return to Armenia (without performing\n\nmilitary      service,         he   would   be    unable     to   join   his    family    in\n\nRussia).5         The IJ disagreed that the petitioner had succeeded in\n\nshowing that he would be unable to fulfill his military commitment\n\nsafely.       On     that      basis,   she      concluded    that   the   petitioner's\n\nprofessed         fear   was    not   objectively         reasonable.      We    test    the\n\nvalidity of that conclusion.\n\n              Determining whether a fear of future persecution is\n\nobjectively reasonable turns on \"whether a reasonable person in the\n\n\n       5\n      It would not profit the petitioner to switch the focus of his\n\"well-founded fear\" argument from his obligation to perform\nmilitary service to the incidents of violence that transpired in\n2001. For one thing, as we have just explained, the IJ supportably\nfound that those incidents did not amount to persecution.       For\nanother thing, the IJ's supportable finding that the violence was\nlocalized would itself refute such an argument, as it would mean\nthat the petitioner retained a viable option of avoiding harassment\nby relocating elsewhere within Armenia.\n\n                                              -12-\n\fasylum applicant's circumstances would fear persecution on account\n\nof a statutorily protected ground.\" Aguilar-Solis v. INS, 168 F.3d\n\n565, 572 (1st Cir. 1999).             In an effort to meet that benchmark, the\n\npetitioner        presented     the    testimony     of    an   expert     in     Armenian\n\npolitics and testimony about his brother's past experience in the\n\nArmenian army.          These presentations comprised a mixed bag.\n\n                The IJ did not consider the petitioner's expert to be an\n\nexpert on Armenian military conditions.                    She nonetheless allowed\n\nhim to testify, on the petitioner's behalf, that the Armenian army\n\nis   a       rough-and-tumble      environment,     in    which     a    whole    host   of\n\nindividuals,          not   just   those   of     Azeri   descent,       are     routinely\n\nharassed.             Harassment    occurs      based     on    a   wide    variety      of\n\ninfelicitous causes, such as religion, sexual preference, failure\n\nto pay bribes, and a perceived lack of patriotism.                      The expert also\n\ntestified that he had no knowledge of any Azeris being killed in\n\nthe course of such harassment.\n\n                The    evidence    anent   the     petitioner's         brother    is    not\n\nhelpful to the petitioner's case.                For two years, at the height of\n\nthe hostilities between Armenia and Azerbaijan (1991-1993), the\n\npetitioner's brother served in the Armenian military without any\n\nuntoward incident.           This fact is some evidence that the petitioner\n\ncould do the same.6\n\n\n         6\n     The fact that the petitioner's brother may have been assisted\nby his father's officer-friend while in the army does not alter\nthis conclusion. There has been no showing that the petitioner\n\n                                           -13-\n\f          On these facts, the IJ found that the petitioner could\n\nkeep his military commitment without an objectively reasonable fear\n\nof persecution on account of his Azeri heritage.               Given the\n\nevidentiary tapestry of the case as a whole, we cannot say that a\n\nreasonable factfinder would be compelled to reach a contrary\n\nconclusion.    When the threat of violence afflicts all persons in a\n\ngiven situation, not just a particular social group or class, that\n\nthreat will not support a finding of a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution.    See Ravindran v. INS, 976 F.2d 754, 759 (1st Cir.\n\n1992) (\"Generally, evidence of widespread violence and human rights\n\nviolations affecting all citizens is insufficient to establish\n\npersecution.\"); Khalaf v. INS, 909 F.2d 589, 592-93 (1st Cir. 1990)\n\n(similar); Rodriguez-Rivera v. U.S. Dep't of Immig. & Natural'n,\n\n848 F.2d 998, 1006 (9th Cir. 1988) (similar).\n\n          Our journey is not yet complete.      In his brief to this\n\ncourt, the petitioner laments that his testimony was improperly\n\ninterpreted.      Despite   his   generalized   claim   that    improper\n\ninterpretation occurred \"throughout the [asylum] hearing,\" his\n\nbrief specifically mentions only one instance of allegedly improper\n\ninterpretation — the petitioner's statement that \"the case didn't\n\nget any closure\" — and does not suggest a more precise translation.\n\n          When examining a claim of improper interpretation, we\n\nmust ask whether a more proficient or more accurate interpretation\n\n\ncould not benefit from such family connections as well.\n\n                                  -14-\n\fwould likely have made a dispositive difference in the outcome of\n\nthe proceeding.     See Singh v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 1139, 1144 (9th\n\nCir. 2004); Perez-Lastor v. INS, 208 F.3d 773, 780 (9th Cir. 2000).\n\nHere, we answer that question in the negative, as the IJ's \"no past\n\npersecution\" finding is amply supported by unchallenged evidence in\n\nthe record.\n\n             The fact that the BIA adopted the IJ's opinion without\n\naddressing the petitioner's improper interpretation claim does not\n\nalter our conclusion.      The BIA is free to take such a stance when\n\nit reasonably concludes that \"any errors in the decision under\n\nreview were harmless or nonmaterial,\" 8 C.F.R. 1003.1(e)(4)(i).\n\nThat principle applies here.\n\n             We need go no further.       After careful evaluation of the\n\nbriefs, the record, and the petitioner's claims, we conclude that\n\nthe   IJ's   decision    (and,   thus,    the   BIA's   affirmance   of    that\n\ndecision)    is   both   supported   by     substantial   evidence   and   not\n\notherwise infected by reversible error.\n\n             The petition for judicial review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\f",

In June of 2001, the petitioner, then twenty years old, entered the United States under a J-1 visa to embark upon a work-study program. Having been lawfully admitted, he proceeded (again, lawfully) to acquire B-2 visitor status, which entitled him to remain until April 10, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner overstayed his departure deadline and, in June of 2002, applied for asylum. The Immigration and Naturalization Service responded by instituting a removal proceeding. The petitioner conceded removability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At an ensuing hearing, an immigration judge (IJ) examined the petitioner's asylum application and the supporting documents submitted therewith (including the affidavit of an expert in Armenian politics and the 2002 State Department country report on human rights practices in Armenia). These exhibits showed a long history of conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Those historic problems were exacerbated by a war that raged from 1988 to 1994. During the war, both Armenians residing in Azerbaijan and Azeris residing in Armenia were confronted with varying degrees of violence and discrimination. As a result, many of the Azeris who had resided in Armenia &#8212; upwards of 185,000 individuals &#8212; fled to Azerbaijan. These ethnic tensions were heightened in 1998 following the election of a self-proclaimed chauvinist, Robert Kocharian, as president of Armenia. Notwithstanding these tensions, a few people of Azeri origin continue to reside in Armenia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner testified against this general background. In his testimony, he noted that his mother is from Azerbaijan. Building on that foundation, he alleged that, in early 2001, he began experiencing attacks upon his person and assaults upon his financial well-being due to his Azeri ethnicity. He further alleged that these intrusions constituted ethnic persecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner mentioned three specific events. In January of 2001, a group of men spouting anti-Azeri ethnic slurs assaulted him. The men told him that he did not have a right to live in Armenia. This assault occurred in Yerevan (where the petitioner lived). The petitioner responded to it by altering his daily routine; he left home earlier in the morning to travel to class and he returned from work later at night in order to avoid unwanted confrontations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All was well until an evening in March, when a group of men accosted the petitioner and struck him with knives and sticks. The marauders told him that he had been forewarned that violence would occur unless he and his Azeri relatives left Armenia. This time, the petitioner suffered significant injuries, which required a two-day hospital stay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This incident prompted the petitioner's family to move to their summer home in rural Ashtarakh, approximately fifteen miles from Yerevan, in hopes of avoiding future trouble. The petitioner resided there from March until June of 2001 and regularly attended school. He experienced no further acts of violence against his person. On April 24, 2001, however, arsonists burned down his store in Yerevan. The petitioner testified that the same nucleus of individuals who had been involved in the two prior assaults also were involved in the arson.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner contemporaneously reported each of these incidents to the police. The incidents were all investigated; one case was closed for lack of evidence; and nothing has yet been resolved in connection with the other two incidents. The petitioner attributes this state of affairs to an unwillingness to prosecute based on his Azeri ethnicity. He concedes, however, that the police responded promptly to the news of the first incident, investigated it, filed a report, and told the petitioner that they would seek to find the miscreants and bring them to justice. He also concedes that, following the second incident, the police again responded promptly, interviewed the petitioner in his hospital room, tracked down the perpetrators, and initiated criminal proceedings against them. These proceedings were pending when the petitioner absconded. Criminal proceedings also were initiated against the persons accused of committing the arson.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The arson proved to be the last straw for several of the petitioner's relatives. His brother and sister-in-law emigrated to Georgia and his parents moved to Russia. The petitioner claims that he was unable to accompany either set of relatives because he had not yet fulfilled Armenia's requirement for military service (and, thus, could not obtain an exit stamp).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The petitioner further testified that he could not meet his military service obligation because he would be murdered by anti-Azeri army officers. Faced with this Hobson's choice, the petitioner fled to the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ found the petitioner's testimony credible as to the raw facts, but nevertheless denied the application for asylum. In the IJ's view, the incidents that the petitioner described did not amount to past persecution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The IJ also determined that the petitioner had failed to demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution. The BIA upheld the IJ's decision without authoring an independent opinion. This petition for judicial review followed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the BIA summarily affirms, this court reviews the IJ's decision \"as if it were the decision of the BIA.\" <i>Olujoke v. Gonz&#225;les,</i> 411 F.3d 16, 21 (1st Cir.2005). Consequently, we focus the lens of our inquiry on the IJ's asylum determination. We employ the highly deferential \"substantial evidence\" standard of review. <i>See Rodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft,</i> 398 F.3d 120, 123 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Makhoul v. Ashcroft,</i> 387 F.3d 75, 79 (1st Cir.2004). This means that the IJ's findings of fact must stand \"unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to establish eligibility for asylum, an alien first must demonstrate that he is a refugee. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1158(b)(1); 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.13(a); <i>see also Makhoul,</i> 387 F.3d at 79. An immigrant is considered a refugee when he or she \"is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, [the native] country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(42)(A). To attain refugee status, therefore, an asylum applicant must satisfy two fundamental criteria: he must (i) qualify under one of the five protected grounds enumerated above and (ii) connect that ground to a well-founded fear of future persecution. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.13; <i>see also Da Silva v. Ashcroft,</i> 394 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the petitioner claims that he experienced bodily injury and property damage due to his Azeri ethnicity. That allegation, on its face, satisfies the \"protected ground\" element. Still, it is not enough for an asylum applicant to show that he has suffered harm on account of a protected ground; he also must satisfy the \"well-founded fear\" requirement. This entails either (i) a showing of past persecution (which establishes a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution) or (ii) independent proof of a well-founded fear of future persecution. <i>See Da Silva,</i> 394 F.3d at 4. Either route requires that the applicant forge a link between the harm asserted and some governmental act or omission. <i>See id.</i> at 7; <i>Thomas v. Ashcroft,</i> 359 F.3d 1169, 1179 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the IJ held that the petitioner had not successfully traveled either route. In so holding, she emphasized that the petitioner's antagonists were not government actors, that the Armenian government was responsive to and protective of Azeris during the relevant time frame, that the violence of which the petitioner complained was localized in nature, that the petitioner could return to Armenia free of an objectively reasonable fear of future attacks, and that his Azeri heritage posed no special danger in connection with future service in the Armenian military.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this mise-en-sc&#232;ne, we first address the petitioner's claim of past persecution. This claim rests on the three incidents recounted above. Because the IJ found the petitioner credible, we accept that those incidents occurred as described.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Importantly, however, the IJ found that all three incidents involved the same nucleus of individuals, under the hegemony of a single ringleader, and that the authorities responded appropriately on each occasion. These findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record. Indeed, they are supported by the petitioner's own testimony. These facts, in turn, adequately ground the IJ's ultimate conclusion that the three incidents did not add up to a showing of past persecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is apodictic that, for asylum purposes, \"not all horrific experiences translate into persecution.\" <i>Rodriguez-Ramirez,</i> 398 F.3d at 124. The incidents recounted here do not compel a finding of past persecution. The basic reason is that the petitioner has not sufficiently connected them to the Armenian government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although persecution is a term of art that lacks precise definition in the immigration context, <i>Negeya v. Gonzales,</i> 417 F.3d 78, 83 (1st Cir.2005), persecution always implies some connection to government action or inaction. <i>See Roman v. INS,</i> 233 F.3d 1027, 1034 (7th Cir.2000). This link may be forged in one of three ways: (i) by evidence that government actors committed or instigated the acts complained of; (ii) by evidence that government actors condoned the acts; or (iii) by evidence of an inability on the part of the government to prevent the acts. <i>See id.</i> (citing <i>Galina v. INS,</i> 213 F.3d 955, 958 (7th Cir.2000)). In other words, the necessary connection may manifest itself in the execution of the persecuting acts themselves, in the condonation of those acts, or in an inability to prevent them. <i>See Berishaj v. Ashcroft,</i> 378 F.3d 314, 323 (3d Cir.2004) (explaining that past persecution requires a showing either that the acts were committed by the government or that the government was unable or unwilling to control them); <i>Bartesaghi-Lay v. INS,</i> 9 F.3d 819, 822 (10th Cir.1993) (similar); <i>see also Da Silva,</i> 394 F.3d at 7 (\"Action by non-governmental actors can undergird a claim of persecution only if there is some showing that the alleged persecutors are in league with the government or are not controllable by the government.\"). The record here does not compel a finding that any such governmental connection existed with respect to the incidents of which the petitioner complains.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most telling datum is that (as the petitioner admitted) the local authorities responded immediately to each incident. Following the initial brouhaha, the police \"promised [the petitioner] that they [would] definitely find and bring to justice [the] people who beat [him] up.\" After the second incident, the police succeeded in tracking down the malefactors and initiated criminal proceedings against them. And when the arson occurred, the police commenced an investigation, identified the alleged ringleader, and again instituted criminal proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the petitioner complains that these endeavors did not pan out more favorably because of his Azeri ethnicity. But that complaint is woven entirely out of the gossamer strands of speculation and surmise. From aught that appears, the authorities made strong efforts to bring those responsible to justice and the absence of any convictions may have had more than a little to do with the fact that the petitioner &#8212; presumably the government's star witness &#8212; fled the jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To cinch matters, the petitioner experienced no violence while residing at his family's summer home. The IJ rejected the petitioner's proffered explanation for that phenomenon &#8212; that he was \"in hiding\" &#8212; because the petitioner, during his stay in Ashtarakh, made frequent public appearances, attended classes, and sat for final examinations at the university. Noting that the incidents were confined to a particular area (Yerevan), the IJ supportably found that the violence was localized and carried out solely by a small band of local hoodlums. That is significant because a finding that violence is localized supports a determination that the violence does not constitute persecution. <i>See Galicia v. Ashcroft,</i> 396 F.3d 446, 448 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Da Silva,</i> 394 F.3d at 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the IJ concluded that the incidents affecting the petitioner, though regrettable, did not as a matter of law constitute persecution at the hands of government officials, but, rather, abuse at the hands of a coterie of local hooligans. Given the lack of any connection between the incidents and any discernible governmental action or inaction, we deem this conclusion supported by substantial evidence. Consequently, we must uphold it. <i>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias,</i> 502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The supportability of the \"no past persecution\" determination brings us to the existence vel non of a well-founded fear of future persecution. On that issue, as on the issue of past persecution, the petitioner bears the burden of proof. <i>See Negeya,</i> 417 F.3d at 82. Because there is no sufficient showing of past persecution, the petitioner must carry that burden unaided by any affirmative presumption. <i>Id.</i> at 82.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A successful showing of a well-founded fear of future persecution must survive scrutiny from both subjective (genuine fear) and objective (objectively reasonable fear) standpoints. <i>See id.</i> at 82; <i>Laurent v. Ashcroft,</i> 359 F.3d 59, 65 (1st Cir.2004). Given the IJ's favorable credibility determination, the petitioner easily satisfies the subjective component of this test. The objective component presents a more daunting challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner rests his fear of future persecution principally on the fact that he will have to undergo compulsory military service should he return to Armenia (without performing military service, he would be unable to join his family in Russia).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The IJ disagreed that the petitioner had succeeded in showing that he would be unable to fulfill his military commitment safely. On that basis, she concluded that the petitioner's professed fear was not objectively reasonable. We test the validity of that conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Determining whether a fear of future persecution is objectively reasonable turns on \"whether a reasonable person in the asylum applicant's circumstances would fear persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground.\" <i>Aguilar-Solis v. INS,</i> 168 F.3d 565, 572 (1st Cir.1999). In an effort to meet that benchmark, the petitioner presented the testimony of an expert in Armenian politics and testimony about his brother's past experience in the Armenian army. These presentations comprised a mixed bag.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ did not consider the petitioner's expert to be an expert on Armenian military conditions. She nonetheless allowed him to testify, on the petitioner's behalf, that the Armenian army is a rough-and-tumble environment, in which a whole host of individuals, not just those of Azeri descent, are routinely harassed. Harassment occurs based on a wide variety of infelicitous causes, such as religion, sexual preference, failure to pay bribes, and a perceived lack of patriotism. The expert also testified that he had no knowledge of any Azeris being killed in the course of such harassment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence anent the petitioner's brother is not helpful to the petitioner's case. For two years, at the height of the hostilities between Armenia and Azerbaijan (1991-1993), the petitioner's brother served in the Armenian military without any untoward incident.

Given the evidentiary tapestry of the case as a whole, we cannot say that a reasonable factfinder would be compelled to reach a contrary conclusion. When the threat of violence afflicts all persons in a given situation, not just a particular social group or class, that threat will not support a finding of a well-founded fear of future persecution. <i>See Ravindran v. INS,</i> 976 F.2d 754, 759 (1st Cir.1992) (\"Generally, evidence of widespread violence and human rights violations affecting all citizens is insufficient to establish persecution.\"); <i>Khalaf v. INS,</i> 909 F.2d 589, 592-93 (1st Cir.1990) (similar); <i>Rodriguez-Rivera v. U.S. Dep't of Immig. &amp; Natural'n,</i> 848 F.2d 998, 1006 (9th Cir.1988) (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our journey is not yet complete. In his brief to this court, the petitioner laments that his testimony was improperly interpreted. Despite his generalized claim that improper interpretation occurred \"throughout the [asylum] hearing,\" his brief specifically mentions only one instance of allegedly improper interpretation &#8212; the petitioner's statement that \"the case didn't get any closure\" &#8212; and does not suggest a more precise translation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When examining a claim of improper interpretation, we must ask whether a more proficient or more accurate interpretation would likely have made a dispositive difference in the outcome of the proceeding. <i>See Singh v. Ashcroft,</i> 367 F.3d 1139, 1144 (9th Cir.2004); <i>Perez-Lastor v. INS,</i> 208 F.3d 773, 780 (9th Cir.2000). Here, we answer that question in the negative, as the IJ's \"no past persecution\" finding is amply supported by unchallenged evidence in the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that the BIA adopted the IJ's opinion without addressing the petitioner's improper interpretation claim does not alter our conclusion. The BIA is free to take such a stance when it reasonably concludes that \"any errors in the decision under review were harmless or nonmaterial,\" 8 C.F.R. 1003.1(e)(4)(i). That principle applies here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. After careful evaluation of the briefs, the record, and the petitioner's claims, we conclude that the IJ's decision (and, thus, the BIA's affirmance of that decision) is both supported by substantial evidence and not otherwise infected by reversible error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>The petition for judicial review is denied.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The petitioner originally sought withholding of removal as well as asylum.

In June of 2001, the petitioner, then twenty years old, entered the United States under a J-1 visa to embark upon a work-study program. Having been lawfully admitted, he proceeded (again, lawfully) to acquire B-2 visitor status, which entitled him to remain until April 10, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner overstayed his departure deadline and, in June of 2002, applied for asylum. The Immigration and Naturalization Service responded by instituting a removal proceeding. The petitioner conceded removability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At an ensuing hearing, an immigration judge (IJ) examined the petitioner's asylum application and the supporting documents submitted therewith (including the affidavit of an expert in Armenian politics and the 2002 State Department country report on human rights practices in Armenia). These exhibits showed a long history of conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Those historic problems were exacerbated by a war that raged from 1988 to 1994. During the war, both Armenians residing in Azerbaijan and Azeris residing in Armenia were confronted with varying degrees of violence and discrimination. As a result, many of the Azeris who had resided in Armenia &#8212; upwards of 185,000 individuals &#8212; fled to Azerbaijan. These ethnic tensions were heightened in 1998 following the election of a self-proclaimed chauvinist, Robert Kocharian, as president of Armenia. Notwithstanding these tensions, a few people of Azeri origin continue to reside in Armenia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner testified against this general background. In his testimony, he noted that his mother is from Azerbaijan. Building on that foundation, he alleged that, in early 2001, he began experiencing attacks upon his person and assaults upon his financial well-being due to his Azeri ethnicity. He further alleged that these intrusions constituted ethnic persecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner mentioned three specific events. In January of 2001, a group of men spouting anti-Azeri ethnic slurs assaulted him. The men told him that he did not have a right to live in Armenia. This assault occurred in Yerevan (where the petitioner lived). The petitioner responded to it by altering his daily routine; he left home earlier in the morning to travel to class and he returned from work later at night in order to avoid unwanted confrontations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All was well until an evening in March, when a group of men accosted the petitioner and struck him with knives and sticks. The marauders told him that he had been forewarned that violence would occur unless he and his Azeri relatives left Armenia. This time, the petitioner suffered significant injuries, which required a two-day hospital stay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This incident prompted the petitioner's family to move to their summer home in rural Ashtarakh, approximately fifteen miles from Yerevan, in hopes of avoiding future trouble. The petitioner resided there from March until June of 2001 and regularly attended school. He experienced no further acts of violence against his person. On April 24, 2001, however, arsonists burned down his store in Yerevan. The petitioner testified that the same nucleus of individuals who had been involved in the two prior assaults also were involved in the arson.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner contemporaneously reported each of these incidents to the police. The incidents were all investigated; one case was closed for lack of evidence; and nothing has yet been resolved in connection with the other two incidents. The petitioner attributes this state of affairs to an unwillingness to prosecute based on his Azeri ethnicity. He concedes, however, that the police responded promptly to the news of the first incident, investigated it, filed a report, and told the petitioner that they would seek to find the miscreants and bring them to justice. He also concedes that, following the second incident, the police again responded promptly, interviewed the petitioner in his hospital room, tracked down the perpetrators, and initiated criminal proceedings against them. These proceedings were pending when the petitioner absconded. Criminal proceedings also were initiated against the persons accused of committing the arson.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The arson proved to be the last straw for several of the petitioner's relatives. His brother and sister-in-law emigrated to Georgia and his parents moved to Russia. The petitioner claims that he was unable to accompany either set of relatives because he had not yet fulfilled Armenia's requirement for military service (and, thus, could not obtain an exit stamp).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The petitioner further testified that he could not meet his military service obligation because he would be murdered by anti-Azeri army officers. Faced with this Hobson's choice, the petitioner fled to the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ found the petitioner's testimony credible as to the raw facts, but nevertheless denied the application for asylum. In the IJ's view, the incidents that the petitioner described did not amount to past persecution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The IJ also determined that the petitioner had failed to demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution. The BIA upheld the IJ's decision without authoring an independent opinion.

Consequently, we focus the lens of our inquiry on the IJ's asylum determination. We employ the highly deferential \"substantial evidence\" standard of review. <i>See Rodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201454\"><a href=\"/opinion/201454/rodriguez-ramirez-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">398</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">120</span></a></span>, 123 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Makhoul v.

An immigrant is considered a refugee when he or she \"is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, [the native] country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(42)(A). To attain refugee status, therefore, an asylum applicant must satisfy two fundamental criteria: he must (i) qualify under one of the five protected grounds enumerated above and (ii) connect that ground to a well-founded fear of future persecution. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.13; <i>see also Da Silva v.

That allegation, on its face, satisfies the \"protected ground\" element. Still, it is not enough for an asylum applicant to show that he has suffered harm on account of a protected ground; he also must satisfy the \"well-founded fear\" requirement. This entails either (i) a showing of past persecution (which establishes a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution) or (ii) independent proof of a well-founded fear of future persecution. <i>See Da Silva,</i> 394 F.3d at 4. Either route requires that the applicant forge a link between the harm asserted and some governmental act or omission. <i>See id.</i> at 7; <i>Thomas v.

In so holding, she emphasized that the petitioner's antagonists were not government actors, that the Armenian government was responsive to and protective of Azeris during the relevant time frame, that the violence of which the petitioner complained was localized in nature, that the petitioner could return to Armenia free of an objectively reasonable fear of future attacks, and that his Azeri heritage posed no special danger in connection with future service in the Armenian military.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this mise-en-sc&#232;ne, we first address the petitioner's claim of past persecution.

These findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record. Indeed, they are supported by the petitioner's own testimony. These facts, in turn, adequately ground the IJ's ultimate conclusion that the three incidents did not add up to a showing of past persecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is apodictic that, for asylum purposes, \"not all horrific experiences translate into persecution.\" <i>Rodriguez-Ramirez,</i> 398 F.3d at 124. The incidents recounted here do not compel a finding of past persecution. The basic reason is that the petitioner has not sufficiently connected them to the Armenian government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although persecution is a term of art that lacks precise definition in the immigration context, <i>Negeya v.

This link may be forged in one of three ways: (i) by evidence that government actors committed or instigated the acts complained of; (ii) by evidence that government actors condoned the acts; or (iii) by evidence of an inability on the part of the government to prevent the acts. <i>See id.</i> (citing <i>Galina v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768849\"><a href=\"/opinion/768849/svetlana-galina-and-viatcheslav-galin-v-immigration-and-naturalization/\"><span class=\"volume\">213</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">955</span></a></span>, 958 (7th Cir.2000)). In other words, the necessary connection may manifest itself in the execution of the persecuting acts themselves, in the condonation of those acts, or in an inability to prevent them. <i>See Berishaj v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"787211\"><a href=\"/opinion/787211/lek-berishaj-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general-of-the-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">378</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></a></span>, 323 (3d Cir.2004) (explaining that past persecution requires a showing either that the acts were committed by the government or that the government was unable or unwilling to control them); <i>Bartesaghi-Lay v.

The record here does not compel a finding that any such governmental connection existed with respect to the incidents of which the petitioner complains.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most telling datum is that (as the petitioner admitted) the local authorities responded immediately to each incident. Following the initial brouhaha, the police \"promised [the petitioner] that they [would] definitely find and bring to justice [the] people who beat [him] up.\" After the second incident, the police succeeded in tracking down the malefactors and initiated criminal proceedings against them. And when the arson occurred, the police commenced an investigation, identified the alleged ringleader, and again instituted criminal proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the petitioner complains that these endeavors did not pan out more favorably because of his Azeri ethnicity. But that complaint is woven entirely out of the gossamer strands of speculation and surmise. From aught that appears, the authorities made strong efforts to bring those responsible to justice and the absence of any convictions may have had more than a little to do with the fact that the petitioner &#8212; presumably the government's star witness &#8212; fled the jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To cinch matters, the petitioner experienced no violence while residing at his family's summer home. The IJ rejected the petitioner's proffered explanation for that phenomenon &#8212; that he was \"in hiding\" &#8212; because the petitioner, during his stay in Ashtarakh, made frequent public appearances, attended classes, and sat for final examinations at the university. Noting that the incidents were confined to a particular area (Yerevan), the IJ supportably found that the violence was localized and carried out solely by a small band of local hoodlums. That is significant because a finding that violence is localized supports a determination that the violence does not constitute persecution. <i>See Galicia v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201419\"><a href=\"/opinion/201419/galicia-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">396</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">446</span></a></span>, 448 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Da Silva,</i> 394 F.3d at 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the IJ concluded that the incidents affecting the petitioner, though regrettable, did not as a matter of law constitute persecution at the hands of government officials, but, rather, abuse at the hands of a coterie of local hooligans. Given the lack of any connection between the incidents and any discernible governmental action or inaction, we deem this conclusion supported by substantial evidence. Consequently, we must uphold it. <i>See INS v.

Because there is no sufficient showing of past persecution, the petitioner must carry that burden unaided by any affirmative presumption. <i>Id.</i> at 82.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A successful showing of a well-founded fear of future persecution must survive scrutiny from both subjective (genuine fear) and objective (objectively reasonable fear) standpoints. <i>See id.</i> at 82; <i>Laurent v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200882\"><a href=\"/opinion/200882/laurent-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">359</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span>, 65 (1st Cir.2004). Given the IJ's favorable credibility determination, the petitioner easily satisfies the subjective component of this test. The objective component presents a more daunting challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner rests his fear of future persecution principally on the fact that he will have to undergo compulsory military service should he return to Armenia (without performing military service, he would be unable to join his family in Russia).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The IJ disagreed that the petitioner had succeeded in showing that he would be unable to fulfill his military commitment safely. On that basis, she concluded that the petitioner's professed fear was not objectively reasonable. We test the validity of that conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Determining whether a fear of future persecution is objectively reasonable turns on \"whether a reasonable person in the asylum applicant's circumstances would fear persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground.\" <i>Aguilar-Solis v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198342\"><a href=\"/opinion/198342/aguilar-solis-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></a></span>, 572 (1st Cir.1999). In an effort to meet that benchmark, the petitioner presented the testimony of an expert in Armenian politics and testimony about his brother's past experience in the Armenian army. These presentations comprised a mixed bag.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ did not consider the petitioner's expert to be an expert on Armenian military conditions. She nonetheless allowed him to testify, on the petitioner's behalf, that the Armenian army is a rough-and-tumble environment, in which a whole host of individuals, not just those of Azeri descent, are routinely harassed. Harassment occurs based on a wide variety of infelicitous causes, such as religion, sexual preference, failure to pay bribes, and a perceived lack of patriotism. The expert also testified that he had no knowledge of any Azeris being killed in the course of such harassment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence anent the petitioner's brother is not helpful to the petitioner's case. For two years, at the height of the hostilities between Armenia and Azerbaijan (1991-1993), the petitioner's brother served in the Armenian military without any untoward incident. This fact is some evidence that the petitioner could do the same.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On these facts, the IJ found that the petitioner could keep his military commitment without an objectively reasonable fear of persecution on account of his Azeri heritage. Given the evidentiary tapestry of the case as a whole, we cannot say that a reasonable factfinder would be compelled to reach a contrary conclusion. When the threat of violence afflicts all persons in a given situation, not just a particular social group or class, that threat will not support a finding of a well-founded fear of future persecution. <i>See Ravindran v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"592069\"><a href=\"/opinion/592069/valli-kandiah-ravindran-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">976</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">754</span></a></span>, 759 (1st Cir.1992) (\"Generally, evidence of widespread violence and human rights violations affecting all citizens is insufficient to establish persecution.\"); <i>Khalaf v.

In his brief to this court, the petitioner laments that his testimony was improperly interpreted. Despite his generalized claim that improper interpretation occurred \"throughout the [asylum] hearing,\" his brief specifically mentions only one instance of allegedly improper interpretation &#8212; the petitioner's statement that \"the case didn't get any closure\" &#8212; and does not suggest a more precise translation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When examining a claim of improper interpretation, we must ask whether a more proficient or more accurate interpretation would likely have made a dispositive difference in the outcome of the proceeding. <i>See Singh v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786150\"><a href=\"/opinion/786150/mohinder-singh-v-john-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">367</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1139</span></a></span>, 1144 (9th Cir.2004); <i>Perez-Lastor v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768263\"><a href=\"/opinion/768263/martin-perez-lastor-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">208</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">773</span></a></span>, 780 (9th Cir.2000). Here, we answer that question in the negative, as the IJ's \"no past persecution\" finding is amply supported by unchallenged evidence in the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that the BIA adopted the IJ's opinion without addressing the petitioner's improper interpretation claim does not alter our conclusion. The BIA is free to take such a stance when it reasonably concludes that \"any errors in the decision under review were harmless or nonmaterial,\" 8 C.F.R. 1003.1(e)(4)(i). That principle applies here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. After careful evaluation of the briefs, the record, and the petitioner's claims, we conclude that the IJ's decision (and, thus, the BIA's affirmance of that decision) is both supported by substantial evidence and not otherwise infected by reversible error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>The petition for judicial review is denied.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The petitioner originally sought withholding of removal as well as asylum. The IJ and the BIA ruled against him with respect to both claims. In this venue, the petitioner disputes only the adverse ruling on asylum. His claim for withholding of removal is, therefore, waived<i>See Makhoul v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201313\"><a href=\"/opinion/201313/makhoul-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">387</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></a></span>, 82 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> It is undisputed that Armenian citizens who wish permanently to relocate outside of Armenia must obtain such an exit stamp</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The parties' briefs indicate that the IJ determined that past persecution did occur. This interpretation is flawed. While the IJ stated preliminarily that the described acts \"can\" be deemed to be past persecution, she ultimately concluded that \"the harm being investigated by the authorities does not appear to constitute persecution.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Alberto R.

For one thing, as we have just explained, the IJ supportably found that those incidents did not amount to persecution. For another thing, the IJ's supportable finding that the violence was localized would itself refute such an argument, as it would mean that the petitioner retained a viable option of avoiding harassment by relocating elsewhere within Armenia</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The fact that the petitioner's brother may have been assisted by his father's officer-friend while in the army does not alter this conclusion.
