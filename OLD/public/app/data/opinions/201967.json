Hernandez Valls for appellees.\n\n\n\n                          December 16, 2005\n\f              LYNCH, Circuit Judge.                Antonio Rivera Torres and Sofía\n\nVillata Sella, debtors, were awarded emotional distress damages by\n\nthe bankruptcy court against the Internal Revenue Service for the\n\nIRS's    violation       of       a    discharge       injunction.        The   Bankruptcy\n\nAppellate Panel affirmed, but remanded the case to the bankruptcy\n\ncourt for reconsideration of debtors' request for attorneys' fees\n\nand litigation costs.                 The United States appeals only the award of\n\nemotional      distress           damages.        We   reverse     the    order    awarding\n\nemotional distress damages because Congress has not waived the\n\nfederal government's sovereign immunity for emotional distress\n\ndamages, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this\n\nopinion.\n\n                                              I.\n\n              Only a brief summary of the facts is necessary.                             On\n\nSeptember 1, 1992, debtors filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The IRS\n\nfiled a proof of claim for $21,587.11, consisting of an unsecured\n\ngeneral claim of $14,486.62 for self-employment income taxes for\n\n1985    and   an   unsecured            priority    claim   of   $7,100.49        for   self-\n\nemployment income taxes for 1989 through 1992. In January of 1993,\n\ndebtors       received        a       discharge     that    freed        them   from     \"all\n\ndischargeable debts,\" which included only the IRS's unsecured\n\ngeneral claim for the 1985 tax deficiency.                         The IRS's claim for\n\nself-employment          taxes          for   1989       through     1992       were     non-\n\n\n\n\n                                              -2-\n\fdischargeable.1   The IRS suspended collection activities on all the\n\ndebts, including the non-discharged debt.\n\n          Debtors filed a tax return for 1995, showing that they\n\nwere entitled to a refund for approximately $1,200.                   The IRS\n\nretained this refund and applied it to the discharged 1985 debt.\n\nAccording to the IRS, this occurred because of an error by an IRS\n\ntechnician.    Since the amount of non-discharged debt exceeded the\n\namount of the refund, an offset was in order.             To do so required\n\nthe inputting of particular codes into the IRS computer system.\n\nHowever, rather than inputting these codes for only the non-\n\ndischarged    debts   associated   with      1989   through   1992,   the   IRS\n\ntechnician    entered   the   codes    for    all    debts,   including     the\n\ndischarged 1985 debts.        The result was that in late 1996, the\n\ndebtors' 1995 refund was applied to the discharged 1985 debt (since\n\nit was the oldest debt) and collection activities were resumed on\n\nall debts, including the 1985 debt, despite the discharge order.\n\n          The debtors began receiving notices from the IRS in\n\nSeptember 1996. They unsuccessfully attempted to resolve the issue\n\n\n     1\n        Section 523(a) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that some\ndebts cannot be discharged, including any tax \"of the kind and for\nthe periods specified in section . . . 507(a)(8) of this title.\"\n11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(1)(A).     Section 507(a)(8)(A)(i), in turn,\ndescribes a tax deficiency for which the return was due within\nthree years prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition. 11\nU.S.C. § 523(a)(1)(A); see also Young v. United States, 535 U.S.\n43, 46 (2002) (describing the operation of §§ 535(a) and\n507(a)(8)). Since the claims based on taxes owed from 1989 through\n1992 fell within this \"three-year lookback period,\" see Young, 535\nU.S. at 46, they could not be discharged.\n\n                                      -3-\n\fwith the IRS over the telephone.           On March 18, 1997, the debtors\n\nfiled a motion in the ongoing Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings\n\nseeking an order that the IRS show cause why it should not be held\n\nin contempt for violating the discharge injunction under 11 U.S.C.\n\n§ 524.     In the motion, the debtors sought compensatory damages,\n\nemotional distress damages, punitive damages, attorneys' fees, and\n\ncosts.     In April 1997, the IRS ceased collection activities and\n\nreversed    the   application   of   the     refund   and   the   bankruptcy\n\ndistribution to the 1985 account, and applied it instead to the\n\n1989 account.     The remainder of the 1985 debt was cleared in August\n\n1997.\n\n            In June of 1998, the IRS filed a motion for summary\n\njudgment requesting that the court dismiss with prejudice the\n\ndebtors' action for contempt. The IRS conceded that its collection\n\nactivities violated the discharge injunction, but argued that § 524\n\ndid not authorize an award of damages.           At the summary judgment\n\nhearing, however, the IRS agreed that it could be held liable for\n\ncompensatory damages, but not for emotional distress damages,\n\npunitive damages, attorneys' fees, and costs. The bankruptcy court\n\nentered partial summary judgment in favor of the debtors, subject\n\nto a later hearing on damages.         The court found that 11 U.S.C.\n\n§ 106(a) abrogated sovereign immunity for monetary relief --\n\nincluding emotional distress damages, but not including punitive\n\ndamages -- entered under 11 U.S.C. § 105(a), the provision of the\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fBankruptcy Code giving the court the power to \"issue any order,\n\nprocess, or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out\n\nthe provisions of this title.\" The court concluded that attorneys'\n\nfees and litigation costs were unwarranted because the debtors had\n\nfailed to seek such fees and costs in administrative proceedings\n\nbefore the IRS.\n\n          After the evidentiary hearing for damages, during which\n\nthe debtors testified as to their out-of-pocket costs and the\n\nemotional distress they experienced as a result of the IRS's\n\nactions, the bankruptcy court awarded Rivera Torres $4,000 for\n\nexpenses and $5,000 for emotional damages, and awarded Villata\n\nSella another $5,000 in emotional damages.\n\n          The IRS appealed only the emotional distress awards to\n\nthe BAP, and debtors cross-appealed from the ruling that they were\n\nnot entitled to attorneys' fees.     The BAP found that § 105(a)\n\npermitted courts to award emotional distress damages.   As for the\n\nIRS's arguments with respect to sovereign immunity, the BAP deemed\n\nthem waived because the precise arguments made had not been raised\n\nbefore the bankruptcy court.   The BAP also reversed the district\n\ncourt's denial of attorneys' fees and costs, and remanded to the\n\nbankruptcy court for further consideration.     The IRS has only\n\nappealed the BAP's award of emotional distress damages. We reverse\n\nand remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                               -5-\n\f                                 II.\n\n           We deal first with the issue of appellate jurisdiction.\n\nWe have jurisdiction to review \"all final decisions, judgments,\n\norders and decrees\" of a BAP.   28 U.S.C. § 158(d)(1).   We have held\n\nthat:\n\n     [W]hen a district court remands a matter to the\n     bankruptcy court for significant further proceedings,\n     there is no final order for the purposes of § 158(d) and\n     the court of appeals lacks jurisdiction. When a remand\n     leaves only ministerial proceedings, for example,\n     computation of amounts according to established formulae,\n     then the remand may be considered final.\n\nIn re Gould & Eberhardt Gear Mach. Corp., 852 F.2d 26, 29 (1st Cir.\n\n1988).   Here, the BAP remanded in part to the bankruptcy court for\n\ndetermination of attorneys' fees, and thus we must consider whether\n\nsuch a remand prevents the exercise of appellate jurisdiction here.\n\nWe conclude that it does not.\n\n           The Supreme Court has held, in the context of an appeal\n\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1291, that a federal district court's decision is\n\nfinal and appealable even if issues regarding attorneys' fees and\n\ncosts remain to be decided.     Budinich v. Becton Dickinson & Co.,\n\n486 U.S. 196, 202-03 (1988) (\"Courts and litigants are best served\n\nby the bright-line rule . . . that a decision on the merits is a\n\n'final decision' for purposes of § 1291 whether or not there\n\nremains for adjudication a request for attorney's fees attributable\n\nto the case.\").\n\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f            The fact that here we are operating under § 158(d) rather\n\nthan § 1291 makes little difference.          We have noted that given\n\n\"[t]he    great   similarity   between   an   adversary   proceeding   in\n\nbankruptcy and an ordinary civil action,\" the standards regarding\n\nfinality in civil actions will track the standards to be applied to\n\njudgments in bankruptcy proceedings.      Estancias La Ponderosa Dev.\n\nCorp. v. Harrington (In re Harrington), 992 F.2d 3, 6 n.3 (1st Cir.\n\n1993). Therefore, we hold that we have appellate jurisdiction over\n\nthe government's appeal.\n\n                                  III.\n\n            We turn now to the issue of sovereign immunity.            The\n\nquestion presented is whether there is an explicit waiver of\n\nsovereign immunity in 11 U.S.C. § 106, as to allow an award of\n\nemotional distress damages against the United States, under the\n\nsanctions provisions of 11 U.S.C. § 105, to remedy a violation of\n\n11 U.S.C. § 524, which enjoins actions to recover discharged\n\ndebts.2   The bankruptcy court and the BAP found that the imposition\n\nof emotional distress damages against the federal government was\n\n\n\n\n     2\n       As its final argument, the IRS says there was no basis for\na finding of emotional distress damages. It emphasizes that the\ndebtors had discharged tax liabilities from 1985 and non-discharged\ntax liabilities from 1989 to 1992.     When the IRS corrected its\nerror, it did not return the tax refund; rather, it applied it\nagainst the non-discharged 1989 liability. We will assume, with\nsome skepticism, that the debtors have met the standard for\nemotional distress damages.\n\n                                   -7-\n\fnot barred by sovereign immunity, relying on the waiver of immunity\n\nin § 106.         We believe this to be a question of first impression.\n\n                The debtors were awarded emotional distress damages by\n\nthe bankruptcy court pursuant to a finding that the IRS had\n\nviolated its 11 U.S.C. § 524 obligations not to attempt to collect\n\na discharged debt.          While § 524 itself does not specify remedies\n\nfor its violation, the remedies for violation of § 524 are set\n\nforth under 11 U.S.C. § 105(a), which authorizes courts to \"issue\n\nany order, process, or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to\n\ncarry out the provisions of this title.\"                 The bankruptcy court\n\nreasoned that § 105(a) authorized an award of emotional distress\n\ndamages for violations of § 524, that the waiver of sovereign\n\nimmunity effectuated in § 106 extended to all remedies available\n\nunder       §   105(a),   and   therefore   §   106   authorized   an    award   of\n\nemotional distress damages against the United States.3\n\n                We start with the standards for determining whether\n\nCongress        has   waived    the   sovereign   immunity    of   the    federal\n\ngovernment, noting that we review this determination de novo.\n\n\n        3\n        The BAP erred when it concluded the government had waived\nits arguments for immunity by not raising particular arguments in\nthe bankruptcy court or to it. The rule is that the defense of\nsovereign immunity cannot be waived in litigation.     See United\nStates v. United States Fid. and Guar. Co., 309 U.S. 506, 513\n(1940); Dep't of the Army v. Fed. Labor Relations Auth., 56 F.3d\n273, 275 (D.C. Cir. 1995); see also Irving v. United States, 162\nF.3d 154, 159-61 (1st Cir. 1998) (en banc) (holding that the\ngovernment cannot waive or forfeit an argument that the\ndiscretionary function exception to the Federal Tort Claims Act\n(FTCA) should apply).\n\n                                         -8-\n\fUnited States v. Puerto Rico, 287 F.3d 212, 216 (1st Cir. 2002);\n\nsee also In re BankVest Capital Corp., 360 F.3d 291, 295 (1st Cir.\n\n2004) (\"We review the bankruptcy court's conclusions of law de\n\nnovo, with the benefit of the BAP's bankruptcy expertise but\n\nwithout deference to its conclusions.\" (citing Fed. R. Bankr. P.\n\n7052)). The debtors bear the burden of proof to establish a waiver\n\nof immunity.   See Murphy v. United States, 45 F.3d 520, 522 (1st\n\nCir. 1995).\n\n           The standard for finding a waiver is quite stringent.\n\nA waiver must be \"unequivocally expressed,\" Dep't of the Army v.\n\nBlue Fox, Inc., 525 U.S. 255, 261 (1999) (citing Lane v. Pena, 518\n\nU.S. 187, 192-93 (1996)), and \"must be strictly construed in favor\n\nof the sovereign,\" Orff v. United States, 125 S.Ct. 2606, 2610\n\n(2005), with ambiguities construed against waiver, United States v.\n\nWilliams, 514 U.S. 527, 531 (1995).      Furthermore, a waiver of\n\nsovereign immunity may subject the federal government to some\n\ncategories of damages, but not others.   Lane, 518 U.S. at 192 (\"To\n\nsustain a claim that the Government is liable for awards of\n\nmonetary damages, the waiver must extend unambiguously to such\n\nmonetary claims.\" (emphasis added)).\n\n           The text of § 106(a), as amended in 1994, provides as\n\nfollows:\n\n     (a) Notwithstanding an assertion of sovereign immunity,\n     sovereign immunity is abrogated as to a governmental unit\n     to the extent set forth in this section with respect to\n     the following:\n\n                               -9-\n\f          (1) Sections 105, 106, . . . 362, . . . , 524,\n          . . . of this title.\n\n          (2)   The court may hear and determine any issue\n          arising with respect to the application of such\n          sections to governmental units.\n\n          (3)   The court may issue against a governmental\n          unit an order, process, or judgment under such\n          sections or the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy\n          Procedure, including an order or judgment awarding\n          a money recovery, but not including an award of\n          punitive damages. Such order or judgment for costs\n          or fees under this title or the Federal Rules of\n          Bankruptcy Procedure against any governmental unit\n          shall be consistent with the provisions and\n          limitations of section 2412(d)(2)(A) of title 28.\n\n          (4) The enforcement of any such order, process, or\n          judgment against any governmental unit shall be\n          consistent with appropriate nonbankruptcy law\n          applicable to such governmental unit and, in the\n          case of a money judgment against the United States,\n          shall be paid as if it is a judgment rendered by a\n          district court of the United States.\n\n          (5)   Nothing in this section shall create any\n          substantive claim for relief or cause of action not\n          otherwise existing under this title, the Federal\n          Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, or nonbankruptcy\n          law.\n\n11 U.S.C. § 106(a); see also Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994, Pub. L.\n\nNo. 103-394, § 113, 108 Stat. 4106, 4117-18.   The text of § 106(a)\n\ndoes not specifically refer to emotional distress damages at all.\n\n          There is no doubt that § 106 is an express waiver of\n\nsovereign immunity.   That does not answer the question of what\n\ntypes of relief are encompassed in the waiver.    There is also no\n\ndoubt § 106 is a waiver, in appropriate circumstances, for \"money\n\nrecovery,\" 11 U.S.C. § 106(a)(3), and for entry of money judgments,\n\n                               -10-\n\fid. § 106(a)(4).    We turn later to whether the \"money recovery\"\n\nlanguage constitutes a waiver of immunity for emotional distress\n\ndamages.\n\n           Section 106(a)(3) also contains a waiver of immunity for\n\nan   \"order,   process,   or   judgment\"   issued   under   the   sections\n\nenumerated in § 106(a)(1).        One could argue that this language\n\nconstitutes a flexible waiver of immunity for any \"order, process\n\nor judgment\" that a bankruptcy court may chose to enter under any\n\nof the enumerated sections.        This argument, we think, rests on\n\nentirely too broad a reading of the waiver in § 106.         The argument\n\nis one which would swamp the strict construction and express\n\nstatement rules governing waiver of sovereign immunity.\n\nA.         The Enumerated Sections Under § 106(a)(1) as a Source of\n           Waiver\n\n           A narrower approach is to look at the enumerated sections\n\nand the nature of the relief available under those sections to\n\ndetermine if there has been waiver of immunity as to such relief.\n\nThe inquiry, though, must have temporal confines. We ask not about\n\npresent understandings, but about what Congress understood in 1994,\n\nat the time of the amendment of § 106, to be the content of its\n\nwaiver for \"orders, processes, or judgments\" under § 105 and the\n\nother enumerated sections.      The enumerated section at issue here,\n\n§ 105(a), authorizes the court to issue any order so long as it is\n\n\"necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this\n\ntitle.\"    The temporal distinction we draw is important because it\n\n                                   -11-\n\fmeans that we are not here resolving any question as to the types\n\nof relief that are now available to private parties under any of\n\nthe enumerated sections.\n\n          This     narrower   temporal      approach   --     looking    at\n\ncongressional understanding of the enumerated sections at the time\n\nof the amendment -- is preferable for several reasons.           First, it\n\nis the approach taken by the Supreme Court in several cases.            See\n\nSosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U.S. 692, 711 (2004) (relying on the\n\nfact that Congress' \"provision of an exception when a claim arises\n\nin a foreign country was written at a time when the phrase 'arising\n\nin' was used in state statutes to express the position that a claim\n\narises where the harm occurs\"); Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S.\n\n879, 897 (1988) (\"There is no evidence that any legislator in 1976\n\nunderstood the words 'money damages' to have any meaning other than\n\nthe ordinary understanding of the term as used in the common law\n\nfor centuries.\").\n\n          Second, the approach adheres to the general principle\n\nthat Congress is presumed to know the content of background law.\n\nSee   Smith   v.   United   States,   507   U.S.   197,     203-04   (1993)\n\n(interpreting the scope of the foreign country exception to the\n\nFederal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) in light of the assumption \"'that\n\nCongress legislates against the backdrop of the presumption against\n\nextraterritoriality'\" (quoting EEOC v. Arabian Am. Oil Co., 499\n\nU.S. 244, 248 (1991))); see also Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\fServs., Inc., 125 S.Ct. 2611, 2636 (2005) (\"The Court should\n\nassume, as it ordinarily does, that Congress legislated against a\n\nbackground of law already in place and the historical development\n\nof that law.\"); Villescas v. Abraham, 311 F.3d 1253, 1261 (10th\n\nCir. 2002) (\"We must presume that Congress was aware at those\n\ntimes, and during all the years since 1974 when [the ADEA] was\n\npassed, that the general rule announced by the courts was to forbid\n\ndamages for emotional distress [under the ADEA], and chose not to\n\ninterfere with that rule.\").\n\n          Third, our approach gives content as to what type of\n\nmoney judgment the waiver of immunity applies.\n\n          Fourth, this approach is a corollary of the principle\n\nthat the Code itself should not be read \"to effect a major change\n\nin pre-Code practice\" unless the change is the subject of \"at least\n\nsome discussion in the legislative history.\"   Dewsnup v. Timm, 502\n\nU.S. 410, 419 (1992).4\n\n          Fifth, it also avoids an assumption, engaged in by the\n\nBAP, that the scope of remedies available against private parties\n\nas the law develops are co-extensive with those available against\n\n\n\n     4\n        The government observes that absent a contrary statement,\nCongress may be assumed to have implicitly imparted background law,\nsuch as common law standards, into the Code. See Field v. Mans,\n516 U.S. 59, 73-74 (1995). As the government points out, it has\nfound no pre-Code bankruptcy cases awarding emotional distress\ndamages under similar circumstances. It also argues that \"there is\nno indication in the legislative history that Congress intended to\nmake such [emotional distress] damages available.\"\n\n                               -13-\n\fthe government when it waives immunity.        We note that on the one\n\noccasion that Congress wished to establish co-extensiveness, under\n\nthe FTCA, it was explicit about doing so.5\n\n           And sixth, our principle that the background law against\n\nwhich Congress legislates must have been clearly established at the\n\ntime § 106 was passed is itself reinforced by § 106(a)(5).             That\n\nsection   states:   \"Nothing   in    this   section   shall   create   any\n\nsubstantive claim for relief or cause of action not otherwise\n\nexisting under this title, the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy, or\n\nnonbankruptcy law.\"   11 U.S.C. § 106(a)(5).\n\n           It is arguable that such a narrow temporal approach is\n\nnot appropriate.    There is little reason to doubt that Congress\n\ncould give to another governmental actor some degree of flexibility\n\nto interpret types of relief subject to Congressional waivers of\n\nimmunity and to change those interpretations over time.         But here,\n\n\n\n     5\n        Section 106 does not contain the sort of waiver found in\nthe FTCA, which provides: \"The United States shall be liable,\nrespecting the provisions of this title relating to tort claims, in\nthe same manner and to the same extent as a private individual\nunder like circumstances, but shall not be liable for interest\nprior to judgment or for punitive damages.\"      28 U.S.C. § 2674.\nBased on this waiver, courts have found that the FTCA waives the\nfederal government's immunity in an action against the United\nStates for emotional distress damages.     See Sarno, Recovery of\nDamages for Infliction of Emotional Distress Under Federal Tort\nClaims Act, 107 A.L.R. Fed. 309 (citing cases). By contrast, § 106\ndoes not explicitly tie the scope of government liability to the\nscope of private liability.      Therefore, it is not clear that\nCongress intended to expose the federal government to all the\nremedies that may be imposed on private parties in bankruptcy\nproceedings.\n\n                                    -14-\n\fCongress has clearly endorsed a temporal approach in § 106(a)(5),\n\nby stating that no new rights were to be created through the\n\nmechanism of the waiver of immunity.\n\n          Instead, applying the temporal rule, we assume that if it\n\nwere perfectly clear that the enumerated section at issue, here\n\n§ 105, encompassed the relief of emotional distress damages at the\n\ntime of the amendment of § 106, then the § 106 waiver would\n\nencompass such damages.     But if debtors cannot show that the\n\nbackground law clearly established that they were entitled to\n\nemotional distress damages under the relevant enumerated clauses,\n\nthen this argument fails.\n\n          The government argues that § 105 does not now and has\n\nnever authorized emotional distress damages.       Our concern is\n\nnarrower, and has to do with the background law Congress was\n\npresumed to know in 1994, at the time it waived immunity as to the\n\nenumerated sections.6   The background law at the time Congress\n\npassed the Bankruptcy Reform Act does not support the debtors'\n\nreading of the remedies available as including emotional distress\n\ndamages under the enumerated sections in the waiver language of\n\n§ 106.\n\n\n\n     6\n        The government argues that the rights \"protected under the\nBankruptcy Code are financial and economic rights: the Code is not\ncrafted with a view to protecting debtors from emotional distress.\"\nThis argument would apply to all parties subject to § 105 orders,\nnot just the government. We address only the question of waiver of\nsovereign immunity.\n\n                               -15-\n\f            We start with § 105(a), the statutory sanction power, and\n\n§ 524, the provision violated.        The initial question of whether a\n\nviolation of § 524 could be remedied at all by an award of damages\n\nwas resolved at the time of the amendment of the waiver of immunity\n\nprovision in § 106.   This court did not resolve that question until\n\n2000.    In Bessette v. Avco Financial Services, Inc., 230 F.3d 439,\n\n445 (1st Cir. 2000), as the BAP properly recognized, this court\n\nheld that a district court could award damages as a sanction under\n\n§ 105 for violations of § 524.           Bessette referred to \"actual\n\ndamages,\" but did not specify what was encompassed by this term;\n\nnor did it discuss emotional distress damages.          Our quest narrows\n\nto focus on emotional distress damages and their availability in\n\n1994 under § 105.\n\n            Only one circuit, by 1994, had directly considered the\n\nquestion of whether § 105(a) or § 524 authorized courts to issue\n\nawards   for   emotional   distress    damages,   and   it   answered   that\n\nquestion in the negative.    See Burd v. Walters (In re Walters), 868\n\nF.2d 665, 670 (4th Cir. 1989).         The court vacated the award for\n\nemotional distress, holding: \"[N]o authority is offered to support\n\nthe proposition that emotional distress is an appropriate item of\n\ndamages for civil contempt, and we know of none.\"            Id.\n\n            This conclusion that emotional distress damages were\n\nunavailable was reinforced by the decision in McBride v. Coleman,\n\n955 F.2d 571 (8th Cir. 1992).         McBride dealt with the power of\n\n\n                                  -16-\n\fcivil contempt more generally, not specifically under § 105(a).\n\nThe court, in rejecting an award for emotional distress damages,\n\nheld:\n\n     The problems of proof, assessment, and appropriate\n     compensation attendant to awarding damages for emotional\n     distress are troublesome enough in the ordinary tort\n     cases, and should not be imported into civil contempt\n     proceedings. Although in some circumstances an award of\n     damages to a party injured by the violation of an\n     injunction may be appropriate, the contempt power is not\n     to be used as a comprehensive device for redressing\n     private injuries, and it does not encompass redress for\n     injuries of this sort.\n\nId. at 577.   McBride and Burd make it clear that at the time of the\n\namendment of § 106, the background law was that § 105(a) did not\n\nencompass an award for monetary damages,7 much less for a § 524\n\nviolation.     That   background   law    argues   against   a   finding   of\n\nemotional distress damages.\n\n            Our temporal approach to the issue of availability of\n\nemotional distress damages may differ from that of the Eleventh\n\n\n\n        7\n       The BAP rejected the views of the courts in McBride and\nBurd. Instead it pointed to a single bankruptcy court decision,\nafter the amendment of § 106, finding that court could award\nemotional distress damages against the IRS. Matthews v. United\nStates (In re Matthews), 184 B.R. 594 (Bankr. S.D. Ala. 1995). The\nBAP relied on the fact that Bessette cited Matthews as part of a\nlong string cite, concluding that \"[t]his reference strongly\nsuggests an acknowledgment by the First Circuit that full remedial\nrelief for civil contempt must include emotional distress damages.\"\nThe BAP also pointed to one decision awarding emotional distress\ndamages against a private party under § 105(a), see In re Perviz,\n302 B.R. 357, 372 (Bankr. N.D. Ohio 2003), and two other decisions\nawarding emotional distress damages under § 362(h), see In re\nBishop, 296 B.R. 890 (Bankr. S.D. Ga. 2003); Holden v. IRS (In re\nHolden), 226 B.R. 809, 812 (Bankr. D. Vt. 1998).\n\n                                   -17-\n\fCircuit,    which   has    held     that    §   106(a)   unequivocally   waives\n\nsovereign immunity for court-ordered monetary damages under § 105,\n\nalthough not for punitive damages.              Jove Eng'g, Inc. v. IRS, 92\n\nF.3d 1539, 1555 (11th Cir. 1996); Hardy v. United States (In re\n\nHardy), 97 F.3d 1384 (11th Cir. 1996).            While the Eleventh Circuit\n\nhas not said that emotional distress damages are available as\n\nactual damages, it has tied the waiver of immunity to any monetary\n\nrelief deemed to be \"necessary or appropriate.\"              Hardy, 97 F.3d at\n\n1389-90.    More significantly, Hardy states: \"While it is true that\n\n§ 524 does not specifically authorize monetary relief, the modern\n\ntrend is for courts to award actual damages for violation of § 524\n\nbased on the inherent contempt power of the court.\"               Id. at 1389.\n\nWhatever the modern trend as to private parties, we think the\n\nwaiver of immunity question is a different issue and far narrower.\n\n            Debtors turn by analogy to 11 U.S.C. § 362(h) and argue\n\nit encompasses emotional distress damages within its authorization\n\nfor \"actual damages,\" and that therefore we should read § 105 to\n\nalso cover such damages.          The argument fails.        First, the order\n\nhere was not entered for violation of § 362(h), which prohibits\n\nviolations of the automatic stay provisions during the proceedings;\n\nrather,    the   order    stemmed    from   a   violation   of   the   discharge\n\ninjunction under § 524.           Second, even assuming the analogy to\n\n§ 362(h) is apt, while it is true that the text of § 362(h) does\n\n\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\fprovide for \"actual damages,\"8 there was no consensus in the\n\nbackground law that emotional distress damages are encompassed\n\nwithin \"actual damages\" at the time of the amendment of the\n\nimmunity provision in § 106.\n\n            Even today the question of whether emotional distress\n\ndamages are \"actual damages\" within the meaning § 362(h) has not\n\nbeen conclusively determined.     The Ninth Circuit, the only circuit\n\nto hold thus far that the term \"actual damages\" in § 362(h)\n\nencompasses emotional distress damages, also acknowledges that the\n\nissue of whether that is what Congress intended is not clear.         In\n\nre Dawson, 390 F.3d 1139, 1146 (9th Cir. 2004).         And the Seventh\n\nCircuit has held that \"actual damages\" in § 362(h) contemplated a\n\nfinancial   loss,   not   emotional   distress   damages.9   Aiello   v.\n\nProvidian Fin. Corp., 239 F.3d 876, 881 (7th Cir. 2001).         Aiello\n\npoints out:\n\n     The law has always been wary of claims of emotional\n     distress, because they are so easy to manufacture. For\n     a long time damages for such distress were generally\n\n\n     8\n        In a case that was decided after Hoffman v. Connecticut\nDepartment of Income Maintenance, 492 U.S. 96 (1989), and before\nthe 1994 amendment to § 106, the district court had awarded actual\ndamages for the government's violation of the automatic stay\nprovisions of § 362(h). Small Bus. Admin. v. Rinehart, 887 F.2d\n165, 166 (8th Cir. 1989).     The government in Rinehart did not\nappeal the award of actual damages, only of punitive damages. Id.\nat 166 n.1.\n     9\n       The court in Aiello also suggested that under the \"clean-up\ndoctrine\" of equity, emotional distress might be compensable if\nthere was a \"financial loss to hitch it to.\" Aiello, 239 F.3d at\n880.\n\n                                  -19-\n\f     limited to cases in which the plaintiff was able to prove\n     some other injury. The courts have grown more confident\n     of their ability to sift and value claims of emotional\n     distress, and the old limitations have largely been\n     abandoned; but suspicion lingers as demonstrated by two\n     recent Supreme Court decisions . . . that set a high\n     threshold for proof of damages for emotional distress\n     caused by a denial of due process of law.\n\nId. at 880 (citations omitted) (citing Metro-North Commuter R.R.\n\nCo. v. Buckley, 521 U.S. 424, 428 (1997); Consol. Rail Corp. v.\n\nGottshall, 512 U.S. 532 (1994)).           The Aiello court found it\n\ndoubtful   that   Congress   intended     \"to   change   the   fundamental\n\ncharacter of bankruptcy remedies by enacting [§ 362],\" even in\n\nlight of \"the modern era of receptivity to claims of damages for\n\npurely emotional injury.\"    Id.\n\n           This circuit has not squarely resolved the question,\n\nalthough there is dicta in Fleet Mortgage Group v. Kaneb, 196 F.3d\n\n265 (1st Cir. 1999), suggesting that emotional distress damages may\n\nbe available as \"actual damages\" under § 362(h).         See id. at 269.\n\nThe panel did not reach the question of whether § 362(h) authorizes\n\nemotional distress damages.10\n\n           Thus, none of the enumerated sections in § 106(a)(1)\n\nthat apply directly (§§ 105, 524) or by analogy (§ 362) clearly\n\nestablished the availability, even against private parties, of an\n\n\n     10\n        The language in this opinion is dicta because, as the\nopinion notes, Fleet had failed to make any arguments regarding the\nappropriateness of the emotional distress damages award before the\nBAP, much less regarding whether the statute authorized the award,\nand had therefore waived the argument. Fleet Mortgage Group, 196\nF.3d at 269.\n\n                                   -20-\n\faward   of   emotional       distress       damages    in   1994   as    a   matter   of\n\nbackground law.        Those sections do not provide a basis to find\n\nclear   waiver   of    sovereign       immunity       as    to   emotional    distress\n\ndamages.\n\nB.           The Term \"Money Recovery\" Under § 106(a)(3)\n\n             The debtors also argue that the language \"including an\n\norder   or   judgment       awarding    a    money    recovery\"     in   §   106(a)(3)\n\nauthorizes waiver of sovereign immunity as to emotional distress\n\ndamages.\n\n             The government argues that the phrase \"money recovery\"\n\ndoes not even unambiguously mean \"money damages,\" much less that\n\nmoney damages necessarily includes emotional distress damages. The\n\nbankruptcy court concluded money recovery was the equivalent of\n\nmoney   damages,      and    money    damages     included       emotional    distress\n\ndamages.\n\n             We are reluctant to approach the question as one of\n\nsemantic equivalents, regardless of the circumstances in which the\n\nquestion     arose.         Whether    Congress       intended     the   term   \"money\n\nrecovery\" to mean \"money damages\" may turn on context.                        Bowen v.\n\nMassachusetts, 487 U.S. 879 (1988), makes this point and compels\n\nthe conclusion that the term \"money recovery\" cannot, as a matter\n\nof plain text reading, be deemed to include emotional distress\n\ndamages.     In Bowen, the Court interpreted the waiver of sovereign\n\nimmunity in the Administrative Procedure Act as to claims for\n\n\n                                         -21-\n\f\"relief other than money damages.\"          5 U.S.C. § 702.     The Court drew\n\na distinction between damages, which \"are given to the plaintiff to\n\nsubstitute   for    a   suffered   loss,\"    and    specific    relief,   which\n\n\"attempt to give the plaintiff the very thing to which he was\n\nentitled.\"   Id. at 895 (quoting D. Dobbs, Handbook on the Law of\n\nRemedies 135 (1973)) (internal quotation mark omitted).                 It held\n\nthat 5 U.S.C. § 702, while withholding waiver for \"money damages,\"\n\nstill waived sovereign immunity for specific relief, such as\n\nrecovery of money or properties wrongfully taken.\n\n          The      United   States    argues       in    its   brief   that the\n\nlegislative history of § 106 supports its arguments and that it is\n\nappropriate to consider that history.                   The Supreme Court has\n\nfollowed two different courses as to the relevance of legislative\n\nhistory on questions of statutory waiver of sovereign immunity. In\n\none line of cases, the court has declined to consider legislative\n\nhistory at all.     See, e.g., Orff, 125 S.Ct. at 2610; Blue Fox, 525\n\nU.S. at 261; Lane, 518 U.S. at 192 (\"A statute's legislative\n\nhistory cannot supply a waiver that does not appear clearly in any\n\nstatutory text.\"); see also Marina Bay Realty Trust LLC v. United\n\nStates, 407 F.3d 418, 422 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n          However, in another line of cases, legislative history\n\nplays in important role in construction of the statute as to waiver\n\nof immunity.       That line includes the most recent Supreme Court\n\ndecision about waiver of immunity as to particular remedies, West\n\n\n                                     -22-\n\fv. Gibson, 527 U.S. 212 (1999).          See id. at 222 (examining\n\nlegislative history to determine Congressional intent as to the\n\nterm \"appropriate remedies\").    Other cases, both recent and older,\n\nalso make reference to the legislative history to determine the\n\nmeaning of the terms used by Congress in a statutory waiver of\n\nimmunity.   See Smith, 507 U.S. at 202 n.4;   Bowen, 487 U.S. at 896-\n\n901; see also Sosa, 542 U.S. at 704-709 (relying on legislative\n\nhistory to determine the scope of the foreign country exception to\n\nthe waiver in the FTCA); Scarborough v. Principi, 541 U.S. 401, 421\n\n& n.9 (2004) (relying on legislative history to determine the scope\n\nof waiver of immunity in the Equal Access to Justice Act).\n\n            Moreover, the courts of appeals have frequently looked to\n\nthe legislative history of the waiver of immunity provisions,\n\n§ 106(a), which are at the heart of this case.    See, e.g., Franklin\n\nSav. Corp. v. United States (In re Franklin Sav. Corp.), 385 F.3d\n\n1279, 1290 (10th Cir. 2004); Gordon Sel-Way, Inc. v. United States\n\n(In re Gordon Sel-Way, Inc.), 270 F.3d 280, 285 (6th Cir. 2001);\n\nAnderson v. FDIC, 918 F.2d 1139, 1143 (4th Cir. 1990); Ashbrook v.\n\nBlock, 917 F.2d 918, 924 (6th Cir. 1990).\n\n            We emphasize we do not here look to statutory history to\n\nsupply a waiver that does not appear clearly in any statutory text.\n\nSee Lane, 518 U.S. at 192.       The statutory text clearly waives\n\nimmunity for \"monetary recovery.\"       The question is what Congress\n\nmeant by that phrase.   Thus, our case differs from other sovereign\n\n\n                                 -23-\n\fimmunity cases, like Lane v. Pena, 518 U.S. 187, which addressed\n\nthe question of whether Congress waived immunity for any money\n\nawards at all.      Our case, by contrast, deals with the scope, not\n\nthe   existence,    of   the    waiver.        See   Nagle,   Waiving      Sovereign\n\nImmunity in an Age of Clear Statement Rules, 1995 Wis. L. Rev. 771,\n\n820-21 (observing that clear statement rules are \"well-suited for\n\ninterpretive questions that can be answered with a simple 'yes' or\n\n'no'\" -- such as whether a statutory provision has waived sovereign\n\nimmunity at all -- but that such rules \"pose problems\" with\n\n\"interpretive      questions     that     do   not   present    two       such   sharp\n\nalternatives\" -- such as questions about the scope of a waiver).\n\n            We think legislative history important on at least one\n\npoint.   If the legislative history showed that the clear intent of\n\nCongress in enacting § 106 was to overrule cases holding that no\n\nemotional    distress     damages       were     available,     that       would   be\n\nsignificant.       But the legislative history shows no such thing.\n\nIndeed, it works against finding a waiver of immunity.\n\n            The    legislative     history       shows   that       the    focus   of\n\nCongress's     concern    was    \"monetary      recovery\"      of    a    distinctly\n\ndifferent type than emotional distress damages.                The provision for\n\nwaiver of sovereign immunity in the Bankruptcy Code was overhauled\n\nin 1994.    See Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994, Pub. L. No. 103-394,\n\n§ 113, 108 Stat 4106, 4117-18; see also Gibson, Congressional\n\nResponse to Hoffman and Nordic Village: Amended Section 106 and\n\n\n                                        -24-\n\fSovereign Immunity, 69 Am. Bankr. L.J. 311 (1995). Before the 1994\n\namendment,     §    106(c)     had    provided   that   \"notwithstanding   any\n\nassertion of sovereign immunity\" any provision of the Bankruptcy\n\nCode   which       contained    the     phrase   \"creditor,\"   \"entity,\"    or\n\n\"governmental unit\" applied to governmental units and that \"a\n\ndetermination by a court of an issue arising under such a provision\n\n[bound] governmental units.\"             Hoffman v. Conn. Dep't of Income\n\nMaint., 492 U.S. 96, 100-01 (1989) (providing former version of\n\n§ 106).     In passing the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994, Congress\n\nprovided a waiver of immunity for \"an order, process or judgment\"\n\nunder one of enumerated sections, \"including an order or judgment\n\nawarding a money recovery, but not including an award of punitive\n\ndamages.\"    11 U.S.C. § 106(a)(3).\n\n            The House Report accompanying the final bill demonstrates\n\nthat Congress intended to abrogate two Supreme Court cases which\n\nhad held that § 106, as it then stood, did not waive sovereign\n\nimmunity.    See H.R. Rep. No. 103-835, at 42 (1994), reprinted in\n\n1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3340, 3350-51.           One case, Hoffman, 492 U.S. 96,\n\ninvolved the sovereign immunity of state agencies in an action\n\nwhere the bankruptcy trustee sought to recover Medicaid payments\n\nowed to a nursing home.         In Hoffman, the plurality held that § 106,\n\nread as a whole, did not waive immunity for monetary recovery, but\n\nwaived immunity only for declaratory and injunctive relief, binding\n\ngovernmental units to issues determined by the bankruptcy court\n\n\n                                        -25-\n\feven when those units did not appear before the court.              Id. at 99-\n\n100.    The other case, United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503\n\nU.S. 30 (1992), involved the waiver of the sovereign immunity of\n\nthe federal government, and specifically, the IRS.                  There, the\n\nbankruptcy trustee for a corporate debtor sought recovery of an\n\nimproper post-petition transfer of estate property by an officer of\n\nthe    bankrupt   company   to    pay    off   the   officer's   personal   tax\n\nliabilities.      The Court, after finding that the waiver under then\n\n§ 106(a) and (b) (now § 106(b) and (c)) were unavailable, found\n\nthere were at least two interpretations of § 106(c) that limited\n\nthe waiver to declaratory and injunctive relief, and so the waiver\n\ncould not be said to be \"unambiguous\" as to damages.                     Neither\n\nHoffman nor Nordic Village involved emotional distress damages, but\n\nonly classic recovery of moneys already paid to the United States\n\nthat    the   estate   wished    to   recover.       The   legislative   history\n\nsupports the view that the \"money recovery\" language in the new\n\n§ 106 was in reference to the type of recoveries involved in\n\nHoffman and Nordic Village and not emotional distress damages.\n\n              In the end, it is clear that Congress has not \"definitely\n\nand unequivocally\" waived sovereign immunity under § 106(a) of the\n\nBankruptcy Code for emotional damages awards in circumstances such\n\nas these.11 We hold, therefore, that sovereign immunity bars awards\n\n\n\n       11\n        Neither side suggests that § 106(b) or (c) plays a role in\nthis case.\n\n                                        -26-\n\ffor emotional distress damages against the federal government under\n\n§ 105(a) for any willful violation of § 524, and that immunity is\n\nnot waived by § 106.\n\n          If more were needed, and it is not, our view is also that\n\nrecognizing a waiver of sovereign immunity for emotional distress\n\ndamages in this case would run afoul of § 106(a)(5), which forbids\n\nthe creation of any substantive claim for relief \"not otherwise\n\nexisting under this title, the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy, or non-\n\nbankruptcy law.\"   11 U.S.C. § 105(a)(5).\n\n          For the above reasons we reverse the portion of the\n\njudgment awarding emotional distress damages against the IRS and\n\nremand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                       (Concurrence follows.)\n\n\n\n\n                                -27-\n\f            TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge, Concurring.            I concur with the\n\nresult in this case: 11 U.S.C. § 106 does not contain an explicit\n\nwaiver of sovereign immunity as to emotional distress damages under\n\n11 U.S.C. § 105.       However, I write separately because I am not\n\npersuaded that it is either necessary or appropriate to look to\n\nlegislative history to reach this result.\n\n            The rule is that \"a waiver of the Federal Government's\n\nsovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed.\" Lane v. Pena,\n\n518 U.S. 187, 192 (1996).        This rule applies to awards for monetary\n\ndamages.    Id. at 192-93.        Even when a cause of action has been\n\nauthorized against the government, sovereign immunity may be waived\n\nwith regard to certain remedies but not as to others.               \"To sustain\n\na claim that the Government is liable for awards of monetary\n\ndamages, the waiver must extend unambiguously to such monetary\n\nclaims.\" Id. at 192 (citing United States v. Nordic Village, Inc.,\n\n503 U.S. 30, 34 (1992)).\n\n            Because the waiver must be unequivocally expressed, our\n\nanalysis is confined to the text of the statute itself.                    Lane\n\ndictates in no uncertain terms that \"[a] statute's legislative\n\nhistory cannot supply a waiver that does not appear clearly in any\n\nstatutory   text;   the    unequivocal       expression     of   elimination   of\n\nsovereign   immunity      that   we   insist    upon   is   an   expression    in\n\nstatutory text.\"       Id. (internal citation and quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n\n                                      -28-\n\f            As the majority opinion observes, the text of the statute\n\ndoes not mention emotional distress damages one way or another.\n\nAnd thus, of the utmost importance is the meaning of the term\n\n\"money recovery.\"      Section 106(a)(3) of the Bankruptcy Code waives\n\nsovereign   immunity    for   claims   for    \"money   recovery\"   and   only\n\nexplicitly excludes \"punitive damages\" from the waiver.                  The\n\nspecific exclusion of         punitive damages might indicate -- as\n\ndebtors suggest -- that \"money recovery\" should be read broadly to\n\ninclude   all   categories    of   monetary    relief,   including   \"money\n\ndamages.\"    Indeed, the Eleventh Circuit has stated that § 106\n\n(a)(3)'s waiver of sovereign immunity extended to \"money damages.\"\n\nSee Jove Engineering, Inc. v. IRS, 92 F.3d 1539, 1555 (11th Cir.\n\n1996).1\n\n            Although the broad construction suggested above is not\n\nwithout superficial logic, a \"waiver of sovereign immunity must be\n\n\n\n     1\n          However, Jove Engineering's brief discussion of §\n106(a)(3), leaves unclear whether the court simply assumed that the\nterms \"money recovery\" and \"monetary damages\" were interchangeable.\nSee Jove Engingeering, 92 F.3d at 1555 (concluding that since\n\"[s]ection 106 expressly extends this waiver to permit a court to\n'issue against a governmental unit an order, process, or judgment\n. . . awarding a money recovery'\" it plainly \"waives sovereign\nimmunity for court-ordered monetary damages under § 105\") (citation\nto § 106 corrected from original).\n\n    I do not believe that our holding today is inconsistent with\nJove Engineering because the Eleventh Circuit did not elaborate on\nthe scope of \"monetary damages\" available under Section 106(a)(3),\nexcept to suggest that it would cover at least \"actual expenses,\"\nassuming such expenses were consistent with other statutory\nprovisions. Id. at 1542-43, 1549.\n\n                                    -29-\n\fstrictly construed in favor of the sovereign.\"                      Orff v. United\n\nStates, 125 S. Ct. 2606, 2610 (2005).             Waivers of immunity must be\n\nexpress, not implied, and we will not imply from the failure to\n\nspecifically exclude emotional distress damages -- even where\n\npunitive damages are specifically excluded -- that such damages are\n\nincluded.\n\n            In Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879 (1988), the\n\nSupreme Court suggested a distinction between specific relief and\n\ndamages    that    is    of   some   assistance    in   our   analysis.        Bowen\n\ninterpreted       \"monetary       relief\"    to   include     the    two    separate\n\ncategories    of    \"money     damages\"     and   \"specific    relief.\"        Bowen\n\nconsidered the Administrative Procedure Act's (\"APA\") waiver of\n\nsovereign immunity, 5 U.S.C. § 702, as to claims for \"relief other\n\nthan money damages.\"          Interpreting the term \"money damages,\" the\n\nCourt distinguished between damages and specific relief, explaining\n\nthat \"[d]amages are given to the plaintiff to substitute for a\n\nsuffered    loss,       whereas   specific     remedies     'are    not    substitute\n\nremedies at all, but attempt to give the plaintiff the very thing\n\nto which he was entitled.'\" Bowen, 487 U.S. at 895 (quoting D.\n\nDobbs, Handbook on the Law of Remedies 135 (1973)).                  In Bowen, the\n\nCourt held that specific relief, such as recovery of specific\n\nproperty or monies wrongfully taken, could still be awarded against\n\nthe government even where \"money damages\" were unavailable. Bowen,\n\n487 U.S. at 893.         In the words of the Supreme Court:\n\n\n                                        -30-\n\f               Our cases have long recognized the distinction\n               between an action at law for damages -- which\n               are intended to provide a victim with monetary\n               compensation for an injury to his person,\n               property, or reputation -- and an equitable\n               action for specific relief -- which may\n               include    an   order   providing    for   the\n               reinstatement of an employee with backpay, or\n               for \"the recovery of specific property or\n               monies, ejectment from land, or injunction\n               either directing or restraining the defendant\n               officer's actions.\"\n\nId. (quoting Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Commerce Corp., 337 U.S.\n\n682, 688 (1949)) (emphasis added).\n\n               The Court's reasoning in Bowen provides some foundation\n\nwith       which   to   speculate   that    Congress's   waiver   of   sovereign\n\nimmunity for \"money recovery\" could conceivably be limited to\n\nclaims for specific relief, such as where a government creditor\n\nwrongfully collected funds from a debtor, and the debtor now seeks\n\nto have those monies returned.               The use of the term \"recovery\"\n\nrather than \"damages\" suggests that there is property in the hands\n\nof the government which originally belonged to appellees and which\n\nappellees could \"recover.\"2                In addition, this interpretation\n\nappears to be the most straightforward since specific monetary\n\nrelief would be the logical remedy in cases where a creditor has\n\n\n\n\n       2\n        A narrow interpretation of \"monetary recovery\" would also\nremain truer to the common usage of the term \"recovery\" to indicate\nretrieval of something that one formerly possessed. See, e.g., The\nAmerican Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (4th ed. 2000)\n(defining \"recover\" as \"[t]o get back; regain\").\n\n                                       -31-\n\fimproperly recovered a debt that had already been discharged\n\nthrough bankruptcy.\n\n          In light of the discussion in Bowen, we cannot say that\n\n\"money recovery,\" as used in § 106(a)(3), unambiguously includes\n\nmonetary damages, when it appears at least equally likely that\n\nCongress intended to waive sovereign immunity only with respect to\n\nclaims for specific relief.      The fact that there are \"plausible\"\n\nreadings of a statute that do not require waiver of sovereign\n\nimmunity \"is enough to establish that a reading imposing monetary\n\nliability on the Government is not 'unambiguous' and therefore\n\nshould not be adopted,\" even though the interpretations against\n\nwaiver \"are assuredly not the only readings.\"            Nordic Village, 503\n\nU.S. at 37.\n\n          In     the   end,   Congress     has     not     \"definitely      and\n\nunequivocally\"    waived   sovereign    immunity    under    §   106   of   the\n\nBankruptcy Code for emotional damages.        United States v. Horn, 29\n\nF.3d 754, 762 (1st Cir. 1994).         We must assume that had Congress\n\nmeant to waive sovereign immunity for all forms of \"monetary\n\nrelief\" or \"money damages\" specifically, it could have done so.\n\nSee, e.g., Bowen, 487 U.S. at 896 (refusing to \"substitute the\n\nwords 'monetary relief' for the words 'money damages' actually\n\nselected by Congress\" in that statute).\n\n\n\n\n                                  -32-\n\f          Because I believe the foregoing analysis to be sufficient\n\nto reach the judgment with which we all agree, I have written\n\nseparately in this case.\n\n\n\n\n                               -33-\n\f",

On\n\nSeptember 1, 1992, debtors filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The IRS\n\nfiled a proof of claim for $21,587.11, consisting of an unsecured\n\ngeneral claim of $14,486.62 for self-employment income taxes for\n\n1985    and   an   unsecured            priority    claim   of   $7,100.49        for   self-\n\nemployment income taxes for 1989 through 1992. In January of 1993,\n\ndebtors       received        a       discharge     that    freed        them   from     \"all\n\ndischargeable debts,\" which included only the IRS's unsecured\n\ngeneral claim for the 1985 tax deficiency.                         The IRS's claim for\n\nself-employment          taxes          for   1989       through     1992       were     non-\n\n\n\n\n                                              -2-\n\fdischargeable.1   The IRS suspended collection activities on all the\n\ndebts, including the non-discharged debt.\n\n          Debtors filed a tax return for 1995, showing that they\n\nwere entitled to a refund for approximately $1,200.                   The IRS\n\nretained this refund and applied it to the discharged 1985 debt.\n\nAccording to the IRS, this occurred because of an error by an IRS\n\ntechnician.    Since the amount of non-discharged debt exceeded the\n\namount of the refund, an offset was in order.             To do so required\n\nthe inputting of particular codes into the IRS computer system.\n\nHowever, rather than inputting these codes for only the non-\n\ndischarged    debts   associated   with      1989   through   1992,   the   IRS\n\ntechnician    entered   the   codes    for    all    debts,   including     the\n\ndischarged 1985 debts.        The result was that in late 1996, the\n\ndebtors' 1995 refund was applied to the discharged 1985 debt (since\n\nit was the oldest debt) and collection activities were resumed on\n\nall debts, including the 1985 debt, despite the discharge order.\n\n          The debtors began receiving notices from the IRS in\n\nSeptember 1996. They unsuccessfully attempted to resolve the issue\n\n\n     1\n        Section 523(a) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that some\ndebts cannot be discharged, including any tax \"of the kind and for\nthe periods specified in section . . . 507(a)(8) of this title.\"\n11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(1)(A).     Section 507(a)(8)(A)(i), in turn,\ndescribes a tax deficiency for which the return was due within\nthree years prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition. 11\nU.S.C. § 523(a)(1)(A); see also Young v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118486\"><a href=\"/opinion/118486/young-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 46 (2002) (describing the operation of §§ 535(a) and\n507(a)(8)). Since the claims based on taxes owed from 1989 through\n1992 fell within this \"three-year lookback period,\" see Young, 535\nU.S. at 46, they could not be discharged.\n\n                                      -3-\n\fwith the IRS over the telephone.           On March 18, 1997, the debtors\n\nfiled a motion in the ongoing Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings\n\nseeking an order that the IRS show cause why it should not be held\n\nin contempt for violating the discharge injunction under 11 U.S.C.\n\n§ 524.     In the motion, the debtors sought compensatory damages,\n\nemotional distress damages, punitive damages, attorneys' fees, and\n\ncosts.     In April 1997, the IRS ceased collection activities and\n\nreversed    the   application   of   the     refund   and   the   bankruptcy\n\ndistribution to the 1985 account, and applied it instead to the\n\n1989 account.     The remainder of the 1985 debt was cleared in August\n\n1997.\n\n            In June of 1998, the IRS filed a motion for summary\n\njudgment requesting that the court dismiss with prejudice the\n\ndebtors' action for contempt. The IRS conceded that its collection\n\nactivities violated the discharge injunction, but argued that § 524\n\ndid not authorize an award of damages.           At the summary judgment\n\nhearing, however, the IRS agreed that it could be held liable for\n\ncompensatory damages, but not for emotional distress damages,\n\npunitive damages, attorneys' fees, and costs. The bankruptcy court\n\nentered partial summary judgment in favor of the debtors, subject\n\nto a later hearing on damages.         The court found that 11 U.S.C.\n\n§ 106(a) abrogated sovereign immunity for monetary relief --\n\nincluding emotional distress damages, but not including punitive\n\ndamages -- entered under 11 U.S.C. § 105(a), the provision of the\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fBankruptcy Code giving the court the power to \"issue any order,\n\nprocess, or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out\n\nthe provisions of this title.\" The court concluded that attorneys'\n\nfees and litigation costs were unwarranted because the debtors had\n\nfailed to seek such fees and costs in administrative proceedings\n\nbefore the IRS.\n\n          After the evidentiary hearing for damages, during which\n\nthe debtors testified as to their out-of-pocket costs and the\n\nemotional distress they experienced as a result of the IRS's\n\nactions, the bankruptcy court awarded Rivera Torres $4,000 for\n\nexpenses and $5,000 for emotional damages, and awarded Villata\n\nSella another $5,000 in emotional damages.\n\n          The IRS appealed only the emotional distress awards to\n\nthe BAP, and debtors cross-appealed from the ruling that they were\n\nnot entitled to attorneys' fees.     The BAP found that § 105(a)\n\npermitted courts to award emotional distress damages.   As for the\n\nIRS's arguments with respect to sovereign immunity, the BAP deemed\n\nthem waived because the precise arguments made had not been raised\n\nbefore the bankruptcy court.

The\n\nquestion presented is whether there is an explicit waiver of\n\nsovereign immunity in 11 U.S.C. § 106, as to allow an award of\n\nemotional distress damages against the United States, under the\n\nsanctions provisions of 11 U.S.C. § 105, to remedy a violation of\n\n11 U.S.C. § 524, which enjoins actions to recover discharged\n\ndebts.2   The bankruptcy court and the BAP found that the imposition\n\nof emotional distress damages against the federal government was\n\n\n\n\n     2\n       As its final argument, the IRS says there was no basis for\na finding of emotional distress damages. It emphasizes that the\ndebtors had discharged tax liabilities from 1985 and non-discharged\ntax liabilities from 1989 to 1992.     When the IRS corrected its\nerror, it did not return the tax refund; rather, it applied it\nagainst the non-discharged 1989 liability. We will assume, with\nsome skepticism, that the debtors have met the standard for\nemotional distress damages.\n\n                                   -7-\n\fnot barred by sovereign immunity, relying on the waiver of immunity\n\nin § 106.         We believe this to be a question of first impression.\n\n                The debtors were awarded emotional distress damages by\n\nthe bankruptcy court pursuant to a finding that the IRS had\n\nviolated its 11 U.S.C. § 524 obligations not to attempt to collect\n\na discharged debt.          While § 524 itself does not specify remedies\n\nfor its violation, the remedies for violation of § 524 are set\n\nforth under 11 U.S.C. § 105(a), which authorizes courts to \"issue\n\nany order, process, or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to\n\ncarry out the provisions of this title.\"                 The bankruptcy court\n\nreasoned that § 105(a) authorized an award of emotional distress\n\ndamages for violations of § 524, that the waiver of sovereign\n\nimmunity effectuated in § 106 extended to all remedies available\n\nunder       §   105(a),   and   therefore   §   106   authorized   an    award   of\n\nemotional distress damages against the United States.3\n\n                We start with the standards for determining whether\n\nCongress        has   waived    the   sovereign   immunity    of   the    federal\n\ngovernment, noting that we review this determination de novo.\n\n\n        3\n        The BAP erred when it concluded the government had waived\nits arguments for immunity by not raising particular arguments in\nthe bankruptcy court or to it.

Such order or judgment for costs\n          or fees under this title or the Federal Rules of\n          Bankruptcy Procedure against any governmental unit\n          shall be consistent with the provisions and\n          limitations of section 2412(d)(2)(A) of title 28.\n\n          (4) The enforcement of any such order, process, or\n          judgment against any governmental unit shall be\n          consistent with appropriate nonbankruptcy law\n          applicable to such governmental unit and, in the\n          case of a money judgment against the United States,\n          shall be paid as if it is a judgment rendered by a\n          district court of the United States.\n\n          (5)   Nothing in this section shall create any\n          substantive claim for relief or cause of action not\n          otherwise existing under this title, the Federal\n          Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, or nonbankruptcy\n          law.\n\n11 U.S.C. § 106(a); see also Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994, Pub. L.\n\nNo. 103-394, § 113, 108 Stat. 4106, 4117-18.   The text of § 106(a)\n\ndoes not specifically refer to emotional distress damages at all.\n\n          There is no doubt that § 106 is an express waiver of\n\nsovereign immunity.   That does not answer the question of what\n\ntypes of relief are encompassed in the waiver.    There is also no\n\ndoubt § 106 is a waiver, in appropriate circumstances, for \"money\n\nrecovery,\" 11 U.S.C. § 106(a)(3), and for entry of money judgments,\n\n                               -10-\n\fid. § 106(a)(4).    We turn later to whether the \"money recovery\"\n\nlanguage constitutes a waiver of immunity for emotional distress\n\ndamages.\n\n           Section 106(a)(3) also contains a waiver of immunity for\n\nan   \"order,   process,   or   judgment\"   issued   under   the   sections\n\nenumerated in § 106(a)(1).        One could argue that this language\n\nconstitutes a flexible waiver of immunity for any \"order, process\n\nor judgment\" that a bankruptcy court may chose to enter under any\n\nof the enumerated sections.        This argument, we think, rests on\n\nentirely too broad a reading of the waiver in § 106.         The argument\n\nis one which would swamp the strict construction and express\n\nstatement rules governing waiver of sovereign immunity.\n\nA.         The Enumerated Sections Under § 106(a)(1) as a Source of\n           Waiver\n\n           A narrower approach is to look at the enumerated sections\n\nand the nature of the relief available under those sections to\n\ndetermine if there has been waiver of immunity as to such relief.\n\nThe inquiry, though, must have temporal confines. We ask not about\n\npresent understandings, but about what Congress understood in 1994,\n\nat the time of the amendment of § 106, to be the content of its\n\nwaiver for \"orders, processes, or judgments\" under § 105 and the\n\nother enumerated sections.      The enumerated section at issue here,\n\n§ 105(a), authorizes the court to issue any order so long as it is\n\n\"necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this\n\ntitle.\"    The temporal distinction we draw is important because it\n\n                                   -11-\n\fmeans that we are not here resolving any question as to the types\n\nof relief that are now available to private parties under any of\n\nthe enumerated sections.\n\n          This     narrower   temporal      approach   --     looking    at\n\ncongressional understanding of the enumerated sections at the time\n\nof the amendment -- is preferable for several reasons.           First, it\n\nis the approach taken by the Supreme Court in several cases.            See\n\nSosa v.

As the government points out, it has\nfound no pre-Code bankruptcy cases awarding emotional distress\ndamages under similar circumstances. It also argues that \"there is\nno indication in the legislative history that Congress intended to\nmake such [emotional distress] damages available.\"\n\n                               -13-\n\fthe government when it waives immunity.        We note that on the one\n\noccasion that Congress wished to establish co-extensiveness, under\n\nthe FTCA, it was explicit about doing so.5\n\n           And sixth, our principle that the background law against\n\nwhich Congress legislates must have been clearly established at the\n\ntime § 106 was passed is itself reinforced by § 106(a)(5).             That\n\nsection   states:   \"Nothing   in    this   section   shall   create   any\n\nsubstantive claim for relief or cause of action not otherwise\n\nexisting under this title, the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy, or\n\nnonbankruptcy law.\"   11 U.S.C. § 106(a)(5).\n\n           It is arguable that such a narrow temporal approach is\n\nnot appropriate.    There is little reason to doubt that Congress\n\ncould give to another governmental actor some degree of flexibility\n\nto interpret types of relief subject to Congressional waivers of\n\nimmunity and to change those interpretations over time.         But here,\n\n\n\n     5\n        Section 106 does not contain the sort of waiver found in\nthe FTCA, which provides: \"The United States shall be liable,\nrespecting the provisions of this title relating to tort claims, in\nthe same manner and to the same extent as a private individual\nunder like circumstances, but shall not be liable for interest\nprior to judgment or for punitive damages.\"      28 U.S.C. § 2674.\nBased on this waiver, courts have found that the FTCA waives the\nfederal government's immunity in an action against the United\nStates for emotional distress damages.     See Sarno, Recovery of\nDamages for Infliction of Emotional Distress Under Federal Tort\nClaims Act, 107 A.L.R. Fed. 309 (citing cases). By contrast, § 106\ndoes not explicitly tie the scope of government liability to the\nscope of private liability.      Therefore, it is not clear that\nCongress intended to expose the federal government to all the\nremedies that may be imposed on private parties in bankruptcy\nproceedings.\n\n                                    -14-\n\fCongress has clearly endorsed a temporal approach in § 106(a)(5),\n\nby stating that no new rights were to be created through the\n\nmechanism of the waiver of immunity.\n\n          Instead, applying the temporal rule, we assume that if it\n\nwere perfectly clear that the enumerated section at issue, here\n\n§ 105, encompassed the relief of emotional distress damages at the\n\ntime of the amendment of § 106, then the § 106 waiver would\n\nencompass such damages.     But if debtors cannot show that the\n\nbackground law clearly established that they were entitled to\n\nemotional distress damages under the relevant enumerated clauses,\n\nthen this argument fails.\n\n          The government argues that § 105 does not now and has\n\nnever authorized emotional distress damages.       Our concern is\n\nnarrower, and has to do with the background law Congress was\n\npresumed to know in 1994, at the time it waived immunity as to the\n\nenumerated sections.6   The background law at the time Congress\n\npassed the Bankruptcy Reform Act does not support the debtors'\n\nreading of the remedies available as including emotional distress\n\ndamages under the enumerated sections in the waiver language of\n\n§ 106.\n\n\n\n     6\n        The government argues that the rights \"protected under the\nBankruptcy Code are financial and economic rights: the Code is not\ncrafted with a view to protecting debtors from emotional distress.\"\nThis argument would apply to all parties subject to § 105 orders,\nnot just the government. We address only the question of waiver of\nsovereign immunity.\n\n                               -15-\n\f            We start with § 105(a), the statutory sanction power, and\n\n§ 524, the provision violated.        The initial question of whether a\n\nviolation of § 524 could be remedied at all by an award of damages\n\nwas resolved at the time of the amendment of the waiver of immunity\n\nprovision in § 106.   This court did not resolve that question until\n\n2000.    In Bessette v. Avco Financial Services, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">230</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">439</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n445 (1st Cir. 2000), as the BAP properly recognized, this court\n\nheld that a district court could award damages as a sanction under\n\n§ 105 for violations of § 524.           Bessette referred to \"actual\n\ndamages,\" but did not specify what was encompassed by this term;\n\nnor did it discuss emotional distress damages.          Our quest narrows\n\nto focus on emotional distress damages and their availability in\n\n1994 under § 105.\n\n            Only one circuit, by 1994, had directly considered the\n\nquestion of whether § 105(a) or § 524 authorized courts to issue\n\nawards   for   emotional   distress    damages,   and   it   answered   that\n\nquestion in the negative.

Although in some circumstances an award of\n     damages to a party injured by the violation of an\n     injunction may be appropriate, the contempt power is not\n     to be used as a comprehensive device for redressing\n     private injuries, and it does not encompass redress for\n     injuries of this sort.\n\nId. at 577.   McBride and Burd make it clear that at the time of the\n\namendment of § 106, the background law was that § 105(a) did not\n\nencompass an award for monetary damages,7 much less for a § 524\n\nviolation.     That   background   law    argues   against   a   finding   of\n\nemotional distress damages.\n\n            Our temporal approach to the issue of availability of\n\nemotional distress damages may differ from that of the Eleventh\n\n\n\n        7\n       The BAP rejected the views of the courts in McBride and\nBurd. Instead it pointed to a single bankruptcy court decision,\nafter the amendment of § 106, finding that court could award\nemotional distress damages against the IRS. Matthews v.

While the Eleventh Circuit\n\nhas not said that emotional distress damages are available as\n\nactual damages, it has tied the waiver of immunity to any monetary\n\nrelief deemed to be \"necessary or appropriate.\"              Hardy, 97 F.3d at\n\n1389-90.    More significantly, Hardy states: \"While it is true that\n\n§ 524 does not specifically authorize monetary relief, the modern\n\ntrend is for courts to award actual damages for violation of § 524\n\nbased on the inherent contempt power of the court.\"               Id. at 1389.\n\nWhatever the modern trend as to private parties, we think the\n\nwaiver of immunity question is a different issue and far narrower.\n\n            Debtors turn by analogy to 11 U.S.C. § 362(h) and argue\n\nit encompasses emotional distress damages within its authorization\n\nfor \"actual damages,\" and that therefore we should read § 105 to\n\nalso cover such damages.          The argument fails.        First, the order\n\nhere was not entered for violation of § 362(h), which prohibits\n\nviolations of the automatic stay provisions during the proceedings;\n\nrather,    the   order    stemmed    from   a   violation   of   the   discharge\n\ninjunction under § 524.           Second, even assuming the analogy to\n\n§ 362(h) is apt, while it is true that the text of § 362(h) does\n\n\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\fprovide for \"actual damages,\"8 there was no consensus in the\n\nbackground law that emotional distress damages are encompassed\n\nwithin \"actual damages\" at the time of the amendment of the\n\nimmunity provision in § 106.\n\n            Even today the question of whether emotional distress\n\ndamages are \"actual damages\" within the meaning § 362(h) has not\n\nbeen conclusively determined.     The Ninth Circuit, the only circuit\n\nto hold thus far that the term \"actual damages\" in § 362(h)\n\nencompasses emotional distress damages, also acknowledges that the\n\nissue of whether that is what Congress intended is not clear.

The\n\nbankruptcy court concluded money recovery was the equivalent of\n\nmoney   damages,      and    money    damages     included       emotional    distress\n\ndamages.\n\n             We are reluctant to approach the question as one of\n\nsemantic equivalents, regardless of the circumstances in which the\n\nquestion     arose.         Whether    Congress       intended     the   term   \"money\n\nrecovery\" to mean \"money damages\" may turn on context.

The Court drew\n\na distinction between damages, which \"are given to the plaintiff to\n\nsubstitute   for    a   suffered   loss,\"    and    specific    relief,   which\n\n\"attempt to give the plaintiff the very thing to which he was\n\nentitled.\"   Id. at 895 (quoting D. Dobbs, Handbook on the Law of\n\nRemedies 135 (1973)) (internal quotation mark omitted).                 It held\n\nthat 5 U.S.C. § 702, while withholding waiver for \"money damages,\"\n\nstill waived sovereign immunity for specific relief, such as\n\nrecovery of money or properties wrongfully taken.\n\n          The      United   States    argues       in    its   brief   that the\n\nlegislative history of § 106 supports its arguments and that it is\n\nappropriate to consider that history.                   The Supreme Court has\n\nfollowed two different courses as to the relevance of legislative\n\nhistory on questions of statutory waiver of sovereign immunity. In\n\none line of cases, the court has declined to consider legislative\n\nhistory at all.

That line includes the most recent Supreme Court\n\ndecision about waiver of immunity as to particular remedies, West\n\n\n                                     -22-\n\fv.

If the legislative history showed that the clear intent of\n\nCongress in enacting § 106 was to overrule cases holding that no\n\nemotional    distress     damages       were     available,     that       would   be\n\nsignificant.       But the legislative history shows no such thing.\n\nIndeed, it works against finding a waiver of immunity.\n\n            The    legislative     history       shows   that       the    focus   of\n\nCongress's     concern    was    \"monetary      recovery\"      of    a    distinctly\n\ndifferent type than emotional distress damages.                The provision for\n\nwaiver of sovereign immunity in the Bankruptcy Code was overhauled\n\nin 1994.    See Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994, Pub. L.

In passing the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994, Congress\n\nprovided a waiver of immunity for \"an order, process or judgment\"\n\nunder one of enumerated sections, \"including an order or judgment\n\nawarding a money recovery, but not including an award of punitive\n\ndamages.\"    11 U.S.C. § 106(a)(3).\n\n            The House Report accompanying the final bill demonstrates\n\nthat Congress intended to abrogate two Supreme Court cases which\n\nhad held that § 106, as it then stood, did not waive sovereign\n\nimmunity.    See H.R. Rep. No. 103-835, at 42 (1994), reprinted in\n\n1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3340, 3350-51.

There, the\n\nbankruptcy trustee for a corporate debtor sought recovery of an\n\nimproper post-petition transfer of estate property by an officer of\n\nthe    bankrupt   company   to    pay    off   the   officer's   personal   tax\n\nliabilities.      The Court, after finding that the waiver under then\n\n§ 106(a) and (b) (now § 106(b) and (c)) were unavailable, found\n\nthere were at least two interpretations of § 106(c) that limited\n\nthe waiver to declaratory and injunctive relief, and so the waiver\n\ncould not be said to be \"unambiguous\" as to damages.                     Neither\n\nHoffman nor Nordic Village involved emotional distress damages, but\n\nonly classic recovery of moneys already paid to the United States\n\nthat    the   estate   wished    to   recover.       The   legislative   history\n\nsupports the view that the \"money recovery\" language in the new\n\n§ 106 was in reference to the type of recoveries involved in\n\nHoffman and Nordic Village and not emotional distress damages.\n\n              In the end, it is clear that Congress has not \"definitely\n\nand unequivocally\" waived sovereign immunity under § 106(a) of the\n\nBankruptcy Code for emotional damages awards in circumstances such\n\nas these.11 We hold, therefore, that sovereign immunity bars awards\n\n\n\n       11\n        Neither side suggests that § 106(b) or (c) plays a role in\nthis case.\n\n                                        -26-\n\ffor emotional distress damages against the federal government under\n\n§ 105(a) for any willful violation of § 524, and that immunity is\n\nnot waived by § 106.\n\n          If more were needed, and it is not, our view is also that\n\nrecognizing a waiver of sovereign immunity for emotional distress\n\ndamages in this case would run afoul of § 106(a)(5), which forbids\n\nthe creation of any substantive claim for relief \"not otherwise\n\nexisting under this title, the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy, or non-\n\nbankruptcy law.\"   11 U.S.C. § 105(a)(5).\n\n          For the above reasons we reverse the portion of the\n\njudgment awarding emotional distress damages against the IRS and\n\nremand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                       (Concurrence follows.)\n\n\n\n\n                                -27-\n\f            TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge, Concurring.            I concur with the\n\nresult in this case: 11 U.S.C. § 106 does not contain an explicit\n\nwaiver of sovereign immunity as to emotional distress damages under\n\n11 U.S.C. § 105.       However, I write separately because I am not\n\npersuaded that it is either necessary or appropriate to look to\n\nlegislative history to reach this result.\n\n            The rule is that \"a waiver of the Federal Government's\n\nsovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed.\" Lane v.

The\n\nspecific exclusion of         punitive damages might indicate -- as\n\ndebtors suggest -- that \"money recovery\" should be read broadly to\n\ninclude   all   categories    of   monetary    relief,   including   \"money\n\ndamages.\"    Indeed, the Eleventh Circuit has stated that § 106\n\n(a)(3)'s waiver of sovereign immunity extended to \"money damages.\"\n\nSee Jove Engineering, Inc. v.

Bowen\n\ninterpreted       \"monetary       relief\"    to   include     the    two    separate\n\ncategories    of    \"money     damages\"     and   \"specific    relief.\"        Bowen\n\nconsidered the Administrative Procedure Act's (\"APA\") waiver of\n\nsovereign immunity, 5 U.S.C. § 702, as to claims for \"relief other\n\nthan money damages.\"          Interpreting the term \"money damages,\" the\n\nCourt distinguished between damages and specific relief, explaining\n\nthat \"[d]amages are given to the plaintiff to substitute for a\n\nsuffered    loss,       whereas   specific     remedies     'are    not    substitute\n\nremedies at all, but attempt to give the plaintiff the very thing\n\nto which he was entitled.'\" Bowen, 487 U.S. at 895 (quoting D.\n\nDobbs, Handbook on the Law of Remedies 135 (1973)).                  In Bowen, the\n\nCourt held that specific relief, such as recovery of specific\n\nproperty or monies wrongfully taken, could still be awarded against\n\nthe government even where \"money damages\" were unavailable. Bowen,\n\n487 U.S. at 893.

The use of the term \"recovery\"\n\nrather than \"damages\" suggests that there is property in the hands\n\nof the government which originally belonged to appellees and which\n\nappellees could \"recover.\"2                In addition, this interpretation\n\nappears to be the most straightforward since specific monetary\n\nrelief would be the logical remedy in cases where a creditor has\n\n\n\n\n       2\n        A narrow interpretation of \"monetary recovery\" would also\nremain truer to the common usage of the term \"recovery\" to indicate\nretrieval of something that one formerly possessed. See, e.g., The\nAmerican Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (4th ed. 2000)\n(defining \"recover\" as \"[t]o get back; regain\").\n\n                                       -31-\n\fimproperly recovered a debt that had already been discharged\n\nthrough bankruptcy.\n\n          In light of the discussion in Bowen, we cannot say that\n\n\"money recovery,\" as used in § 106(a)(3), unambiguously includes\n\nmonetary damages, when it appears at least equally likely that\n\nCongress intended to waive sovereign immunity only with respect to\n\nclaims for specific relief.      The fact that there are \"plausible\"\n\nreadings of a statute that do not require waiver of sovereign\n\nimmunity \"is enough to establish that a reading imposing monetary\n\nliability on the Government is not 'unambiguous' and therefore\n\nshould not be adopted,\" even though the interpretations against\n\nwaiver \"are assuredly not the only readings.\"            Nordic Village, 503\n\nU.S. at 37.\n\n          In     the   end,   Congress     has     not     \"definitely      and\n\nunequivocally\"    waived   sovereign    immunity    under    §   106   of   the\n\nBankruptcy Code for emotional damages.
