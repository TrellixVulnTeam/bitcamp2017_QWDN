Appellant  Dennis Liberge was charged with\n                    \n\nconspiracy to  possess cocaine  with intent  to distribute  it in\n\nviolation  of  21 U.S.C.      841(a)(1),  841(b)(1)(C), and  846.\n\nAfter trial, a jury  found him guilty.  Appellant  challenges the\n\nconviction,   alleging  that   the  trial   court's  instructions\n\nregarding  the  statute  of  limitations  constituted  reversible\n\nerror.  We affirm.\n\n          Appellant  claims  that  he  entered  a  conspiracy  to\n\ndistribute  cocaine with  several  other  individuals during  the\n\nsummer  of 1986, but that his participation ended well before the\n\ncritical date  for the statute  of limitations bar,  February 26,\n\n1987.  Defense counsel anticipated the importance of  the statute\n\nof  limitations in  its version  of the  jury instructions.   The\n\ntrial judge rejected the proffered instruction and instructed the\n\njury that the government must prove:\n\n            First,  that on  or  after  February  26,\n            1987, and continuing up until June, 1987,\n            the    agreement    specified   in    the\n            indictment, and not some  other agreement\n            or  agreements  existed  or continued  to\n            exist  between  at  least  two  people to\n            possess  cocaine  with   the  intent   to\n            distribute   it.  .   .  .   Second,  the\n            government must prove that Dennis Liberge\n            intentionally joined in this agreement. .\n            . . In summary,  for Dennis Liberge to be\n            convicted of the crime of conspiracy, the\n            government must prove two things beyond a\n            reasonable  doubt:    first, that  on  or\n            after  February 26, 1987,  and continuing\n            up  until June,  1987,  an  agreement  to\n            possess  cocaine  with   the  intent   to\n            distribute  it  existed  or continued  to\n            exist;  and  second, that  Dennis Liberge\n            intentionally joined in  or continued  in\n            that agreement.\n\nAppellant  offered  two exceptions  when  queried  by the  judge.\n\nNeither objection  raised the statute of limitations  issue.  The\n\ntrial court denied the objections.\n\n          To  preserve  an objection  to  a  jury instruction,  a\n\ndefendant must  make a  contemporaneous exception when  the trial\n\ncourt instructs the jury,  which apprises the judge of  the basis\n\nof  the asserted  error.   United States v.  Mendoza-Acevedo, 950\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1991); United States v. McGill,  932 F.2d 16,\n                                                  \n\n17 (1st Cir. 1991); Fed. R. Crim. P. 30  (\"No party may assign as\n\nerror any portion of the charge or omission therefrom unless that\n\nparty  objects thereto  before the jury  retires to  consider its\n\nverdict, stating  distinctly the matter  to which he  objects and\n\nthe grounds of his objections.\").   The rule is not a penalty for\n\ninartfully phrased objections, see 2 Charles Alan Wright, Federal\n                                                                 \n\nPractice &amp; Procedure, Crim. 2d    484 (1982 &amp; supp. 1993),  but a\n                              \n\nfrank  recognition that  a trial  judge cannot correct  errors of\n\nwhich he is unaware.   The failure to object  clearly, therefore,\n\nwaives the issue.  United States v. Glenn, 828 F.2d 855, 862 (1st\n                                         \n\nCir. 1987).\n\n          Appellant contends that in the context of this case and\n\nbased on his previously requested instructions, the court knew or\n\nshould have known  that the critical issue  for the jury  was the\n\nstatute  of limitations requirement that  Liberge was part of the\n\nconspiracy on or after February 26, 1987.  The argument, however,\n\ndoes not serve appellant's cause.  \n\n          The judge instructed the  jury that the government must\n\nprove  beyond a reasonable doubt that Liberge joined or continued\n\n                               -3-\n\nas  a  member  of a  conspiracy  that  began  or continued  after\n\nFebruary  26,  1987.    Appellant  failed  to  object  after  the\n\ninstruction was given, as  required by Rule 30 and  First Circuit\n\nprecedent.  Mendoza-Acevedo, 950 F.2d at 4.  The trial judge thus\n                           \n\njustifiably believed  that he had  addressed appellant's concerns\n\nregarding  the statute  of limitations  bar.  The  two objections\n\nthat appellant raised did not suggest that appellant continued to\n\nobject to the  instruction on the statute of  limitations ground.\n\nAppellant argued  that the  instruction should have  required the\n\ngovernment to prove  the existence of  a conspiracy between  five\n\nnamed  individuals on  or  after February  26,  1987.   This,  of\n\ncourse, was not the government's burden and does not even vaguely\n\nsuggest   the  judge  erred  with   respect  to  the  statute  of\n\nlimitations.    The  second   objection  addressed  an   entirely\n\ndifferent point  not relevant here.   The statute  of limitations\n\nissue therefore is waived.\n\n          Consequently, we may vacate appellant's conviction only\n\nif  the instructional  error was  \"plain.\"   Mendoza-Acevedo, 950\n                                                            \n\nF.2d at  4; McGill, 932 F.2d  at 17.  \"The plain  error hurdle is\n                  \n\nhigh.\"   McGill,  932  F.2d  at  17  (quoting  United  States  v.\n                                                             \n\nHunnewell,  891  F.2d 955,  956 (1st  Cir.  1989)).   Viewing the\n         \n\ncharge as a whole,  as we must, Glenn, 828 F.2d  at 861, the jury\n                                     \n\ncould  not have  been misled  by the  judge's instruction  on the\n\ngovernment's burden.\n\n          The conviction is affirmed.\n                                    \n\n                               -4-\n",
