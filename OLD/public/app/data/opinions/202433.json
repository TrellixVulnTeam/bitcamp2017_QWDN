Weiping Zheng petitions for\n\nreview   of    the   Board   of    Immigration     Appeals’   (BIA)    decision\n\naffirming an immigration judge’s denial of his application for\n\nasylum and withholding of deportation.           We affirm.\n\n                                       I\n\n                                   BACKGROUND\n\n              Zheng, a native and citizen of the People’s Republic of\n\nChina, illegally entered the United States in 2002.               In 2003, the\n\nImmigration and Naturalization Service (INS) initiated removal\n\nproceedings in Los Angeles.           Zheng conceded removability, then\n\napplied for asylum based on his contention that he had experienced\n\nreligious persecution in China due to the fact he is a Christian.\n\nOn January 22, 2003, Zheng’s attorney had the case transferred to\n\nBoston, then notified the court that he was withdrawing as Zheng’s\n\ncounsel.       Three months later the same attorney appeared at a\n\ntelephonic calendar hearing in Boston, and asserted that he had\n\nagreed   to    continue   his     representation    of   Zheng.       The   court\n\nscheduled a merits hearing for February 17, 2004, at which Zheng\n\nappeared without counsel.         The immigration judge (\"IJ\") noted the\n\nfact for the record, but without inquiring whether Zheng was still\n\nrepresented by counsel.\n\n              Zheng testified at length regarding the religious\n\npersecution he allegedly suffered in China, stating that he had\n\n“become a Catholic with [his] grandparents” but that his parents\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fwere not Catholic,” but Buddhists. Zheng was arrested, sometime in\n\n2002, for distributing religious leaflets in public.     The arrest\n\noccurred at 10:00 p.m.    Zheng was unable to describe the contents\n\nof the leaflets in any detail, except that the leaflets were “about\n\nthe Bible and God protecting families.”   Zheng maintained that the\n\npolice had detained and tortured him for four days, then released\n\nhim on “probation” without lodging any charge against him after his\n\nparents posted bail.   According to Zheng, the police required that\n\nhe report once a week following his release.\n\n            At the conclusion of his testimony, Zheng asked that the\n\nIJ transfer the case to Tennessee, where he was then residing.   The\n\nIJ denied the request as untimely, then proceeded to rule on the\n\nmerits of Zheng's asylum application.       The IJ concluded that\n\nZheng’s testimony contained several inconsistencies, hence was not\n\ncreditworthy. Whereupon the IJ denied the Zheng asylum application\n\nand request for withholding of deportation, then ordered that he be\n\ndeported.\n\n            On appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA),\n\nZheng contended that (i) the IJ violated his due process rights by\n\nfailing to ensure that he was represented by counsel at the merits\n\nhearing, and (ii) the IJ’s credibility determination was not\n\nsupported by substantial evidence. After the BIA affirmed the IJ’s\n\ndecision, Zheng petitioned for review of the BIA’s decision.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f                                       II\n\n                                   DISCUSSION\n\nA.   The Due Process Claim\n\n            Zheng reiterates the claim that the IJ was obligated to\n\ninquire, at the February 17, 2004, hearing, as to why Zheng was no\n\nlonger represented by counsel.              Due process claims asserted in\n\ndeportation proceedings are reviewed de novo.              See Kheireddine v.\n\nGonzales, 427 F.3d 80, 83 (1st Cir. 2005).                Although the Sixth\n\nAmendment does not accord prospective deportees a right to counsel,\n\nprovided by the government, the prospective deportee is entitled to\n\nretain counsel at his own expense.            See INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468\n\nU.S. 1032, 1038-39 (1984); Nelson v. INS, 232 F.3d 258, 262 (1st\n\nCir. 2000); 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(b)(4)(A), 1362.             Zheng contends that\n\nit was insufficient that the IJ informed him of his right to retain\n\ncounsel   at   the   outset   of    his     case,   but   rather   the   IJ   was\n\nconstitutionally obligated to remind Zheng of the right to retain\n\ncounsel at each and every subsequent hearing held in his case.                 We\n\ndisagree.\n\n            Zheng cites no supportive authority for this contention.\n\nMoreover, an IJ sufficiently informed Zheng of the right to retain\n\ncounsel at the very outset of his deportation case, following which\n\nhe had thirteen months to arrange for legal representation at the\n\nFebruary 2004 hearing on the merits.            See, e.g., Nelson, 232 F.3d\n\nat 262-63; Hidalgo-Disla v. INS, 52 F.3d 444, 447 (2d Cir. 1995)\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f(rejecting as frivolous the contention that an IJ, who already had\n\nadvised alien of his right to retain counsel at two previously\n\ncontinued hearings, was obligated to remind alien at the third\n\nhearing when he arrived without counsel).              The fact that Zheng\n\nultimately failed to retain counsel to appear at the February 2004\n\nhearing did not obligate the IJ to issue yet another admonishment\n\nor continuance, and the failure to do so did not constitute a\n\ndeprivation of due process.       See id. at 447 (noting that contrary\n\nrule could result in endless continuances).1\n\nB.    The Challenge to the IJ’s Findings of Fact\n\n           Zheng next contends that the explicit finding by the IJ\n\n– that Zheng's description of his arrest was not creditworthy – is\n\nnot   supported   by   the   record.     We   review   adverse   credibility\n\nfindings under a “substantial evidence” standard, whereby “if we\n\ncannot say a finding that the alien is credible is compelled – then\n\nthe decision must be affirmed.”          Chen v. Gonzales, 418 F.3d 110,\n\n113 (1st Cir. 2005); see 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B).          We defer to the\n\nIJ’s credibility determination where three conditions are met: “(1)\n\nthe discrepancies and omissions described by the [IJ] must actually\n\n\n\n      1\n      On appeal, Zheng also contends that the incompetence of his\ncourt interpreter in translating Mandarin Chinese resulted in a\ndeprivation of due process. The alleged translation discrepancies\nZheng identifies – such as the rendering of “Christian” as\n“Catholic” – were not sufficiently material to have affected the\nIJ’s disposition of the asylum claim. See Harutyunyan v. Gonzales,\n421 F.3d 64, 70 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"harmless error\" review); see also\ninfra note 2.\n\n                                       -5-\n\fbe present in the record; (2) the discrepancies and omissions must\n\nprovide specific and cogent reasons to conclude that the alien\n\nprovided incredible testimony; and (3) a convincing explanation for\n\nthe discrepancies or omissions must not have been supplied by the\n\nalien.”   Hoxha v. Gonzales, 446 F.3d 210, 214 (1st Cir. 2006)\n\n(citing In re A-S-, 21 I & N Dec. 1106, 1109 (BIA 1998)); see Syed\n\nv. Ashcroft, 389 F.3d 248, 252 (1st Cir. 2004).        In order to\n\nsupport a finding that the alien’s testimony was not credible,\n\nhowever, the discrepancies normally must pertain to facts central\n\nto the merits of the alien’s claims, not merely to peripheral or\n\ntrivial matters.    See Bojorques-Villanueva v. INS, 194 F.3d 14, 16\n\n(1st Cir. 1999).2\n\n          The IJ predicated his credibility determination on the\n\nfollowing facts: (i) Zheng’s testimony as to the month or day of\n\nhis arrest was “quite vague”; (2) Zheng testified that his arrest\n\noccurred at 10:00 p.m., yet the arrest notice issued by the public\n\nsecurity department states that Zheng was arrested at 10:30 a.m.;\n\n(iii) Zheng incorrectly testified that he left China in April 2002,\n\nwhereas his actual departure date was July 25, 2002; (iv) Zheng\n\n\n     2\n      Zheng alternatively argues that the BIA improperly engaged in\nde novo factfinding, rather than limiting itself to “clear error”\nreview of the IJ’s findings of fact, as required by 8 C.F.R. §\n1003.1(d)(3). We disagree. Zheng objects, for instance, that the\nBIA characterized him as a “Christian,” whereas the IJ had noted\nthat he was baptized a “Catholic.”      As all Catholics are, by\ndefinition, Christians, we are at a loss to see how this\nconstitutes either a material discrepancy, or a prejudicial\ndivergence from the IJ’s findings of fact.\n\n                                 -6-\n\ftestified that he could not remember the details of his arrest\n\nwithout consulting his papers, yet someone subjected to arrest and\n\ntorture likely would retain more vivid memories of such details;\n\n(v) Zheng testified that he had been detained for four days,\n\nwhereas in an earlier interview with an asylum officer and in his\n\nwritten asylum application, he stated that he had been detained for\n\nfifteen days; (vi) when asked about the inconsistency, Zheng\n\ntestified – for the first time – that he was rearrested after he\n\nsubsequently failed to report to the police as required under the\n\nterms of his post-release probation, whereas earlier he had told an\n\nasylum officer that he had complied with the reporting requirement\n\nuntil he left China; (vii) Zheng was unable to recall in any detail\n\nthe religious information contained in the pamphlets that he\n\nassertedly distributed; (viii) Zheng testified that he had been\n\ndischarged from his job after his release from prison on April 30,\n\nwhereas the discharge notice was issued six days prior to his\n\nrelease;   (ix)   the   public   security   department   issued   Zheng   a\n\nresident identification card seventeen days after he departed\n\nChina, which the department would not likely have done were Zheng\n\na fugitive who had failed to check in for his weekly probation\n\nreports; (x) Zheng’s proffered documentation – such as his job\n\ntermination notice – appeared to be amateurish forgeries; and (xi)\n\nZheng’s demeanor during his testimony reflected not only a lack of\n\nconfidence, but evasiveness as well.\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f            On appeal, Zheng challenges only two of the eleven\n\nfindings.      First, he explains that he did not testify that he was\n\narrested    at    10:00    p.m.,   but    simply      that    he   was     distributing\n\nleaflets at 10:00 p.m., and instead, he testified that he was “half\n\nway    through”    his    distribution        when    the    police       arrested     him.\n\nHowever, even accepting this proposed interpretation, arguendo, the\n\nIJ would have had to infer that Zheng had planned to distribute\n\nleaflets for at least twenty-four hours, i.e., around the clock\n\nfrom   10:00     p.m.    to    10:00   p.m.     the   following       evening.         More\n\nplausibly, the testimony implies simply that Zheng was halfway\n\nthrough his planned distribution at 10:00 p.m. when he was arrested\n\n(viz., Zheng had begun distributing at 5 p.m. and had planned to do\n\nso until 5 a.m. the next morning).              Considering the implausibility\n\nof a twenty-four hour distribution plan, the IJ reasonably could\n\nhave    concluded       that    Zheng’s       alternative      interpretation          was\n\nfarfetched.       Accordingly, we conclude that Zheng’s explanation for\n\nthe discrepancy is unconvincing.               See Hoxha, 446 F.3d at 214.\n\n            Zheng       also   notes   that     his   testimony       –    that   he   was\n\ndischarged from his job after his April 30 release from prison –\n\nwas found to be incredible by the IJ, given that the discharge\n\nnotification was dated six days prior to his release.                                Zheng\n\ncorrectly observes that he testified that the discharge occurred\n\nafter his arrest (viz., during his detention), not after his\n\nrelease.    Even if an IJ’s credibility determination is based in\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fpart on an incorrect analysis of hearing testimony, however, we may\n\nnonetheless affirm where we conclude that no realistic possibility\n\nexists    that,      absent   the    error,       the   IJ   would       have    reached   a\n\ndifferent conclusion. See Harutyunyan v. Gonzales, 421 F.3d 64, 70\n\n(1st Cir. 2005); see also Liu v. United States Dep’t of Justice,\n\n455 F.3d 106, 110 (1st Cir. 2006).                       Notwithstanding the IJ’s\n\nerroneous depiction of the Zheng testimony concerning the date of\n\nhis job discharge, the IJ enumerated no less than ten other\n\nindependent       grounds     for    his    credibility           determination      –   all\n\ninvolving       conspicuous         facts     central        to     Zheng’s       religious\n\npersecution claim – for which Zheng has offered neither adequate\n\nnor convincing rebuttal. See Rodriquez Del Carmen v. Gonzales, 441\n\nF.3d     41,    44    (1st    Cir.     2004)      (noting         that    vagueness      and\n\ncontradiction in material details of an alien’s testimony support\n\nan adverse credibility determination); see also Huang v. Gonzales,\n\n438 F.3d 65, 66 (1st Cir. 2006) (observing “the sheer number of\n\nother discrepancies” in alien’s testimony concerning alleged acts\n\nof persecution). Consequently, we must therefore conclude (i) that\n\nthe IJ would have found Zheng's testimony unworthy of credence even\n\nif the IJ had correctly analyzed Zheng’s testimony concerning the\n\njob    discharge,      and    (ii)     that    the      IJ’s      adverse       credibility\n\ndetermination is well supported by “substantial evidence.”\n\n               The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                            -9-\n\f",

Due process claims asserted in deportation proceedings are reviewed <i>de novo. See Kheireddine v. Gonzales,</i> 427 F.3d 80, 83 (1st Cir.2005). Although the Sixth Amendment does not accord prospective deportees a right to counsel, provided by the government, the prospective deportee is entitled to retain counsel at his own expense. <i>See INS v. Lopez-Mendoza,</i> 468 U.S. 1032, 1038-39, 104 S.Ct. 3479, 82 L.Ed.2d 778 (1984); <i>Nelson v. INS,</i> 232 F.3d 258, 262 (1st Cir.2000); 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1229a(b)(4)(A), 1362.

The fact that Zheng ultimately failed to retain counsel to appear at the February 2004 hearing did not obligate the IJ to issue yet another admonishment or continuance, and the failure to do so did not constitute a deprivation of due process. <i>See id.</i> at 447 (noting that contrary rule could result in endless continuances).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The Challenge to the IJ's Findings of Fact</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Zheng next contends that the explicit finding by the IJ&#8212;that Zheng's description of his arrest was not creditworthy&#8212;is not supported by the record.

However, even accepting this proposed interpretation, <i>arguendo,</i> the IJ would have had to infer that Zheng had planned to distribute leaflets for at least <i>twenty-four hours, i.e.,</i> around the clock from 10:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. the following evening. More plausibly, the testimony implies simply that Zheng was halfway through his planned distribution at 10:00 p.m. when he was arrested (<i>viz.,</i> Zheng had begun distributing at 5 p.m. and had planned to do so until 5 a.m. the next morning). Considering the implausibility of a twenty-four hour distribution plan, the IJ reasonably could have concluded that Zheng's alternative interpretation was farfetched.

In 2003, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) initiated removal proceedings in Los Angeles. Zheng conceded removability, then applied for asylum based on his contention that he had experienced religious persecution in China due to the fact he is a Christian. On January 22, 2003, Zheng's attorney had the case transferred to Boston, then notified the court that he was withdrawing as Zheng's counsel. Three months later the same attorney appeared at a telephonic calendar hearing in Boston, and asserted that he had agreed to continue his representation of Zheng. The court scheduled a merits hearing for February 17, 2004, at which Zheng appeared without counsel. The immigration judge (\"IJ\") noted the fact for the record, but without inquiring whether Zheng was still represented by counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Zheng testified at length regarding the religious persecution he allegedly suffered in China, stating that he had \"become a Catholic with [his] grandparents\" but that \"his parents were not Catholic,\" but Buddhists. Zheng was arrested, sometime in 2002, for distributing religious leaflets in public. The arrest occurred at 10:00 p.m. Zheng was unable to describe the contents of the leaflets in any detail, except that the leaflets were \"about the Bible and God protecting families.\" Zheng maintained that the police had detained and tortured him for four days, then released him on \"probation\" without lodging any charge against him after his parents posted bail. According to Zheng, the police required that he report once a week following his release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the conclusion of his testimony, Zheng asked that the IJ transfer the case to Tennessee, where he was then residing. The IJ denied the request as untimely, then proceeded to rule on the merits of Zheng's asylum application. The IJ concluded that Zheng's testimony contained several inconsistencies, hence was not creditworthy. Whereupon the IJ denied the Zheng asylum application and request for withholding of deportation, then ordered that he be deported.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), Zheng contended that (i) the IJ violated his due process rights by failing to ensure that he was represented by counsel at the merits hearing, and (ii) the IJ's credibility determination was not supported by substantial evidence. After the BIA affirmed the IJ's decision, Zheng petitioned for review of the BIA's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>DISCUSSION</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Due Process Claim</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Zheng reiterates the claim that the IJ was obligated to inquire, at the February 17, 2004, hearing, as to why Zheng was no longer represented by counsel. Due process claims asserted in deportation proceedings are reviewed <i>de novo. See Kheireddine v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201881\"><a href=\"/opinion/201881/kheireddine-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span>, 83 (1st Cir.2005). Although the Sixth Amendment does not accord prospective deportees a right to counsel, provided by the government, the prospective deportee is entitled to retain counsel at his own expense. <i>See INS v. Lopez-Mendoza,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111265\"><a href=\"/opinion/111265/ins-v-lopez-mendoza/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1032</span></a></span>, 1038-39, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111265\"><a href=\"/opinion/111265/ins-v-lopez-mendoza/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Zheng contends that it was insufficient that the IJ informed him of his right to retain counsel at the outset of his case, but rather the IJ was constitutionally obligated to remind Zheng of the right to retain counsel at each and every subsequent hearing held in his case. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Zheng cites no supportive authority for this contention. Moreover, an IJ sufficiently informed Zheng of the right to retain counsel at the very outset of his deportation case, following which he had thirteen months to arrange for legal representation at the February 2004 hearing on the merits. <i>See, e.g., Nelson,</i> 232 F.3d at 262-63; <i>Hidalgo-Disla v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"694313\"><a href=\"/opinion/694313/pedro-pablo-hidalgo-disla-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">444</span></a></span>, 447 (2d Cir.1995) (rejecting as frivolous the contention that an IJ, who already had advised alien of his right to retain counsel at two previously continued hearings, was obligated to remind alien at the third hearing when he arrived without counsel). The fact that Zheng ultimately failed to retain counsel to appear at the February 2004 hearing did not obligate the IJ to issue yet another admonishment or continuance, and the failure to do so did not constitute a deprivation of due process. <i>See id.</i> at 447 (noting that contrary rule could result in endless continuances).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The Challenge to the IJ's Findings of Fact</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Zheng next contends that the explicit finding by the IJ&#8212;that Zheng's description of his arrest was not creditworthy&#8212;is not supported by the record.
