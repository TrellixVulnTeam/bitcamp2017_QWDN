Diana Vázquez-Valentín (\"Vázquez\")\n\nbrought an action against defendants -- the Municipality of Toa\n\nBaja; its Mayor, Victor J. Santiago-Díaz (\"Santiago\"); and its\n\nDirector of Human Resources, Milagros Delgado-Ortiz (\"Delgado\") --\n\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for demoting and constructively\n\ndischarging her because of her political affiliation.    Following\n\nthe jury verdict awarding compensatory and punitive damages to\n\nVázquez, defendants seek the entry of judgment on their behalf as\n\na matter of law or, in the alternative, a new trial.    In arguing\n\nfor judgment as a matter of law, defendants aver that plaintiff did\n\nnot introduce sufficient evidence for a jury to reasonably infer\n\nthat defendants discriminated against Vázquez on the basis of her\n\npolitical affiliation.    Such an argument rarely prevails after a\n\nfavorable jury verdict.   However, having reviewed the record with\n\ncare, we agree that it prevails here.   Accordingly, we vacate the\n\nverdict and direct entry of judgment for defendants.\n\n                                 I.\n\n          Drawing on the evidence presented at trial, we begin by\n\ndescribing the background of this case.   Except where noted, this\n\nbackground information is undisputed.\n\n          A. The Change of Administration and Alteration\n             of the Job Classification Plan\n\n          On November 7, 2000, general elections were held in\n\nPuerto Rico.   In the municipality of Toa Baja, defendant Victor J.\n\nSantiago, the PDP candidate for mayor of Toa Baja, defeated the\n\n                                -2-\n\fincumbent NPP candidate, Víctor Soto, who had been mayor for\n\nsixteen years.     In total, the NPP had controlled the municipal\n\ngovernment of Toa Baja for twenty-four years prior to the 2000\n\nelection.\n\n            Upon taking office, the new administration apparently\n\nfaced several challenges.      Among them were issues related to\n\npersonnel actions and human resources plans that were detailed in\n\nseveral documents, including an audit from the Comptroller of\n\nPuerto Rico, dated June 14, 2000; a letter from the Commonwealth's\n\nCentral Office for the Administration of Personnel and Human\n\nResources (known by its acronym \"OCALARH,\" which is based on the\n\nSpanish version of the office's name); and another letter from the\n\nOffice of the Commissioner for Municipal Affairs (similarly known\n\nas \"OCAP\").1     These documents addressed personnel issues of the\n\n\n     1\n      The contents of these documents were not admitted below, over\ndefendants' strenuous objections. The district court found that\nthese documents were inadmissible as hearsay and informed the jury\nonly that defendants sought advice about personnel actions and\nother issues, and that they received such advice from these\nagencies.    The exclusion of these documents as hearsay is\ntroubling. So crucial to the defendants’ case, and offered as an\nexplanation for the personnel actions undertaken by the defendants\nrather than for the truth of the personnel irregularities described\nin the documents, these documents are not hearsay, and they were\nhighly relevant. Their exclusion might well have justified a new\ntrial. However, we do not have to decide that issue because of our\ndisposition of the case on sufficiency of the evidence grounds.\nBecause defendants made an offer of proof regarding these documents\nat trial, we may consider the excluded documents as part of the\nrecord on appeal for the purpose of describing the background of\nthis case. United States v. McDaniel, 482 F.2d 305, 311 (8th Cir.\n1973); see also Wright and Graham, Federal Practice and Procedure:\nEvidence § 5040 (1977) (\"Documents and other exhibits are usually\n\n                                 -3-\n\fmunicipality.           In Puerto Rico, all municipal jobs are governed by\n\nso-called job classification plans that are adopted locally. These\n\nplans set forth the occupational groups and personnel structure of\n\nthe    municipality,         including         the   primary    responsibilities       and\n\nemployment requirements for each position in city government.                          The\n\nsalaries for various jobs are set forth in a separate salary scale\n\nthat establishes the salary for each job by classification.\n\n                 From     time    to   time,    municipalities       revise    their    job\n\nclassification plans.              Toa Baja undertook this task in 1997, when\n\nit altered the then-existing job classification plan that had been\n\nadopted in 1991.2           According to the Comptroller's report, the 1997\n\nchanges were not valid alterations to the 1991 plan because they\n\nwere       not    first    submitted      for    approval      to   OCALARH,   and     past\n\nmunicipal administrations had appointed several hundred employees\n\nin violation of the relevant state law and regulations. The report\n\nalso recommended both that the municipality put in place a system\n\nfor the          selection       and   recruitment     of   personnel    and    that    the\n\n\n\n\nmarked for identification and become part of the record on appeal,\neven if excluded.\"). We do not consider these excluded documents\nin conducting our sufficiency of the evidence analysis.\n       2\n      The parties bitterly dispute whether this alteration was in\nfact an altogether \"new plan\" of job classifications or simply an\n\"amendment\" to the existing 1991 job classification plan (\"the 1991\nplan\"). The relevant ramifications of that distinction, as well as\nthe approval process and the related municipal ordinances, are not\ngermane to the sufficiency of the evidence claim, and we do not\ndelve into them here.\n\n                                               -4-\n\fadministration develop a corrective action plan to remedy the\n\nvarious illegalities cited therein.3\n\n            Defendants then undertook a review of the personnel files\n\nof all 1,300 or so municipal employees. Defendants claim that they\n\ndid so because, according to the Comptroller's report, \"[n]ot\n\naddressing the recommendations of the audit . . . without just\n\ncause[] may constitute a violation [of] . . . the Government Ethics\n\nAct.\"    Plaintiff maintains that the defendants sought to retaliate\n\nagainst members of the NPP.     As of May 2002, at the time of the\n\ntrial, around six hundred files had been evaluated, including\n\n\n\n     3\n      On August 2, 2004, the same district court that heard this\ncase issued an Opinion and Order and Partial Judgment in a related\ncase, Maria Aldarondo Lugo v. Municipality of Toa Baja, Civil No.\n02-1123 (“August 2 Opinion”). In Lugo, ninety-five employees and\nformer employees of Toa Baja sued the city, Santiago, and Delgado,\nthe latter two defendants in both their official and individual\ncapacities, alleging politically discriminatory personnel actions.\nOne group of plaintiffs alleged only political harassment. In the\nAugust 2 Opinion, the district court granted qualified immunity to\nSantiago and Delgado in their personal capacity, except with\nrespect to the claim of the few plaintiffs alleging only political\nharassment.    Relying on the documentary evidence excluded in\nVázquez’s trial but admitted in Lugo, the district court held that\n\n            [d]efendants have shown with documentation and\n            affidavits that they had legitimate reasons\n            (i) to believe that the 1997 Changes were a\n            new plan (including the view of governmental\n            agencies)   and   (ii)    for   re-classifying\n            Plaintiffs. Defendants have also shown that\n            they did such re-classification in accordance\n            with the law and at the instance of the\n            Comptroller, a man appointed by the NPP former\n            governor.\n\nAugust 2 Opinion at 23.\n\n                                 -5-\n\fVázquez's.      Of those, 281 employees had sought an informal hearing\n\nregarding the personnel action that resulted from the review.\n\n               B.    Vázquez's Political Activity and Employment History\n\n               Vázquez has been active in the NPP since the age of\n\neighteen.       She was president or chair of the NPP committee in her\n\nward       (Barrio   Pajaros   in   Toa    Baja),   and    she    worked   on   the\n\nmobilization         committee,   organized     rallies,    and   raised   funds.\n\nAdditionally, she was one of the NPP's electoral college officers.\n\n               Her employment at the municipality of Toa Baja started in\n\n1985, when Vázquez was employed in a transitory position4 as an\n\noffice clerk.        On February 1, 1989, she became a career employee in\n\nthe position of Office Worker/Typist I at a monthly salary of $545.\n\nOn July 1, 1993, Vázquez was appointed to the position of Secretary\n\nIII, with a monthly salary of $1019, at the request of David\n\nCórdova Torrech (\"Córdova\"), her immediate supervisor and head of\n\nthe Office of Services to the Citizenry.                   Twenty days later,\n\nCórdova asked that Vázquez be reassigned again, this time to the\n\nposition of Assistant Director of the newly created Levittown\n\nbranch of the Office of Services to the Citizenry.                  That request\n\nwas granted, and Vázquez assumed the position of Assistant Director\n\non August 16, with a monthly salary of $1752.\n\n\n\n       4\n      Government employees in Puerto Rico are classified as\n\"transitory\" or \"temporary,\" which essentially means the employment\nis at-will, or as \"career\" or \"permanent,\" which is the equivalent\nof having job tenure with attendant vested property rights.\n\n                                          -6-\n\f          In 1997, the alteration to the job classification plan\n\neliminated the position of Assistant Director from the employment\n\nhierarchy. In the wake of that elimination, Vázquez was reassigned\n\nto the position of Executive Director II.     Two years later, in\n\n1999, Vázquez was appointed as an Administrative Assistant to Mayor\n\nSoto, a trust position within the administration.   Following NPP's\n\ndefeat at the polls in 2000, Vázquez was reassigned to her former\n\nposition of Executive Director II.\n\n          C.   Vázquez's Demotion\n\n          On May 22, 2001, the defendants, Mayor Santiago and\n\nDirector of Human Resources Delgado, held a meeting with fifteen to\n\neighteen employees, including Vázquez, to notify them that their\n\nclassifications were being changed pursuant to the decision to\n\ndeclare the 1997 plan null and void and return to the 1991\n\nclassifications.   According to Vázquez, Santiago explained at that\n\nmeeting that the PDP had won the election and, in Vázquez's words,\n\nsaid that \"they had to adopt actions with employees, that they had\n\nto clean house . . . .\"   Santiago then explained that the affected\n\nemployees had certain rights to administrative hearings and, again\n\nin Vázquez's words, \"that whomever wished to go through attorneys,\n\nwell, they then had to bear the consequences of their actions and\n\nthat we would see each other in Court.\"     Vázquez testified that\n\nDelgado then took the floor, saying that she agreed with Santiago;\n\n\n\n\n                                -7-\n\fDelgado then explained the appeals process to the reclassified\n\nemployees.\n\n              Following Delgado's explanation of the appeals process,\n\nthe       employees   were   handed    letters     describing   their   new\n\nclassifications        and    explaining     the      reasons    for    the\n\nreclassifications.       The letter to Vázquez stated that she lacked\n\nthe academic preparation or experience for her current position and\n\nwas being reassigned to Office Worker/Typist I, the position she\n\nheld in 1989. According to the defendants' review of her personnel\n\nfile, that was the last position to which Vázquez had validly been\n\nappointed.\n\n              Vázquez attended a hearing in front of an administrative\n\nhearing officer on September 9, 2001.5           According to Vázquez, the\n\nhearing lasted approximately five minutes.           In January 2002, the\n\nhearing officer issued a report and recommendation to the effect\n\nthat Vázquez had been illegally hired and promoted.               Although\n\nVázquez remained in the Executive Director II position at the\n\nmonthly salary of $2083 pending the outcome of the hearing, she was\n\nofficially reassigned to Office Worker/Typist I by letter of\n\nJanuary 30, 2002.       Her monthly salary was reduced accordingly to\n\n\n      5\n      This hearing is apparently different than the hearing\naffected employees could seek before the Board of Appeals of the\nPersonnel Administration System (which is known as \"JASAP\").\nVázquez was notified of her right to request an administrative\nhearing before JASAP to challenge the demotion, but she declined to\nseek such a hearing because, in her opinion, the \"hearing would be\nfutile and a sham and would violate [her] right to a due process.\"\n\n                                      -8-\n\f$900, effective February 1.         On March 15, 2002, Vázquez tendered\n\nher   resignation    to   Santiago,       effective     April   9.     Vázquez's\n\nemployment history with the municipality is summarized below, with\n\nappointment date or year, job title, and monthly salary where\n\nknown.\n\n            •    1985: Office clerk\n\n            •    February 1, 1989:          Office    Worker/Typist     I   ($545\n                 monthly salary)\n\n            •    July 1, 1993: Secretary III ($1019 monthly salary)\n\n            •    August 16, 1993: Assistant Director ($1752 monthly\n                 salary)\n\n            •    1997: Executive Director II (change of title because\n                 of changes in the 1997 plan)\n\n            •    May   1,  1999:      Administrative        Assistant       (trust\n                 position)\n\n            •    January 10, 2001:          Executive     Director    II    ($2083\n                 monthly salary)\n\n            •    February 1, 2002:          Office    Worker/Typist     I    ($900\n                 monthly salary)\n\n            •    April 9, 2002: resignation effective\n\n\n            D.   The Lawsuit\n\n            Vázquez brought this civil rights action pursuant to 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983 on June 13, 2001, against the municipality of Toa\n\nBaja,    Mayor   Santiago,    and   Human     Resources     Director    Delgado.\n\nVázquez sued Santiago and Delgado in both their official and\n\npersonal capacities.         Vázquez alleged that she was demoted and\n\nconstructively     discharged,      and    that   these    adverse    employment\n\n                                      -9-\n\factions violated her First Amendment and due process rights under\n\nthe United States Constitution.               In her complaint, she sought\n\ncompensatory and punitive damages, as well as reinstatement.                 The\n\ndefendants denied the allegations and replied that Vázquez was\n\nillegally appointed to her position with the city and that they\n\nwere obligated to correct the irregularity.\n\n           On March 27, 2002, prior to trial, the defendants moved\n\nfor   summary    judgment,   with      Santiago   and   Delgado    raising   the\n\naffirmative defense of qualified immunity in their individual\n\ncapacities.     The district court denied the motion.             A jury trial\n\nbegan on April 30, 2002.      At the close of all evidence, defendants\n\nmoved for judgment as a matter of law under Federal Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 50, arguing that Vázquez did not produce sufficient\n\nevidence to show (1) that her due process rights were violated, (2)\n\nthat her political affiliation was a substantial or motivating\n\nfactor for      her   demotion,   or    (3)   that   she   was   constructively\n\ndischarged.     The district court granted defendants' Rule 50 motion\n\nas to the due process claim but denied it in all other respects,\n\nincluding the qualified immunity defense.6\n\n           On May 14, the jury found for plaintiff, awarding her\n\n$275,000 in compensatory damages for mental and emotional pain and\n\nsuffering, $6,828 in compensatory damages for lost earnings, and\n\n\n\n      6\n      Vázquez does not appeal the district court's ruling on her\ndue process claim.\n\n                                       -10-\n\f$42,000 in punitive damages, for a total of $323,828, plus post-\n\njudgment interest, reasonable costs, and attorney's fees.7                 In\n\nlight of the jury finding that the defendants discriminated against\n\nVázquez on the basis of her political affiliation and the jury's\n\naward of punitive damages, the district court rejected Santiago's\n\nand   Delgado's      affirmative   defense    of   qualified   immunity.   The\n\ndistrict court then denied defendants' post-trial Rule 59 motion,\n\nwhich asked the court to set aside the compensatory and punitive\n\ndamages as excessive and without a sound evidentiary basis.                The\n\ndistrict court also ordered the defendants to reinstate Vázquez to\n\nher previous position of Executive Director II.\n\n               The defendants raise several arguments on appeal. First,\n\nthey urge that the district court erred in denying their Rule 50\n\nmotion    as    to   the   political    discrimination   claim.8     Second,\n\n\n      7\n      The pain and suffering damages were apportioned among the\ndefendants as follows: $178,750 from the municipality; $68,750 from\nSantiago; and $27,500 from Delgado. The lost earnings award was\nassessed jointly and severally against all defendants, and the\npunitive damages were assessed $30,000 to Santiago and $12,000 to\nDelgado.\n      8\n      Although defendants made a motion pursuant to Rule 50(a)\nbefore the case was submitted to the jury, they failed to renew\nthat motion after the jury verdict.     Ordinarily, that omission\nwould mean that a party could not seek judgment as a matter of law\non appeal. See Udemba v. Nicoli, 237 F.3d 8, 13 (1st Cir. 2001)\n(\"[T]o preserve for appeal the district court's rejection of a\nmotion for judgment as a matter of law made at the close of the\nevidence, the movant must seasonably renew that motion post-\nverdict\").   However, \"even when a party has failed to make the\nproper motion below, this court retains the authority to 'inquire\nwhether the record reflects an absolute dearth of evidentiary\nsupport for the jury's verdict.'\" Id. (quoting Faigin v. Kelly,\n\n                                       -11-\n\fdefendants      argue   that   the   district   court   erred   in   denying\n\nadmissibility of the Comptroller's report and agency letters, which\n\ndefendants maintain were crucial to substantiating that political\n\ndiscrimination was not a factor in Vázquez's reassignment.            Third,\n\ndefendants claim that the trial court made allegedly prejudicial\n\nremarks in front of the jury.         Fourth, defendants assert that the\n\ndistrict court erred in ordering plaintiff reinstated to her\n\nprevious position of Executive Director II.             Finally, in their\n\nindividual capacity, defendants challenge the district court's\n\ndenial   of    the   qualified   immunity   defense.      Because    of   our\n\ndisposition of the sufficiency of the evidence claim, we do not\n\nreach defendants' other arguments.\n\n                                      II.\n\n              A.   Standard of Review\n\n              The standard for setting aside a jury verdict pursuant to\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(b) is a stringent one: \"[W]e\n\nmust examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\nplaintiff and determine whether there are facts and inferences\n\nreasonably drawn from those facts which lead to but one conclusion\n\n-- that there is a total failure of evidence to prove plaintiff's\n\ncase.\" Mayo v. Schooner Capital Corp., 825 F.2d 566, 568 (1st Cir.\n\n\n\n184 F.3d 67, 76 (1st Cir. 1999)).    We invoke our authority to\nassess the sufficiency of the evidence here. We also note that\nplaintiff has failed to allege defendants' forfeiture of the\nsufficiency of the evidence issue.\n\n                                     -12-\n\f1987) (quotation and citation omitted).               In reviewing the record,\n\nwe will evaluate neither the credibility of the witnesses nor the\n\nweight of the evidence. Santiago-Negron v. Castro-Davila, 865 F.2d\n\n431, 445 (1st Cir. 1989).                Even though we draw all rational\n\ninferences from the facts in favor of plaintiff, \"the plaintiff is\n\nnot entitled to inferences based on speculation and conjecture.\"\n\nFerrer v. Zayas, 914 F.2d 309, 311 (1st Cir. 1990).

Temple-Inland Forest Prod. Corp., 243 F.3d 57, 76\n\n(1st Cir. 2001) (quotation and citation omitted).

Analysis of Political Discrimination Claims\n\n              A governmental employee who is not in a policy-making\n\nposition      of    confidence     and   trust   is    shielded    from    adverse\n\nemployment         decisions     because    of   the    employee's        political\n\naffiliation. Figueroa-Serrano v. Ramos-Alverio, 221 F.3d 1, 7 (1st\n\nCir. 2000) (citing Branti v. Finkel, 445 U.S. 507, 517-19 (1980),\n\nand   Rutan    v.    Republican    Party    of   Illinois,   497   U.S.     62,   75\n\n(1990)).9      When a plaintiff brings a political discrimination\n\n\n      9\n      Although Vázquez held a trust position in the previous\nadministration from May 1, 1999, to January 10, 2001, her removal\nfrom that position and restoration to Executive Director II are not\n\n                                         -13-\n\fclaim, she bears the burden of \"producing sufficient direct or\n\ncircumstantial evidence from which a jury reasonably may infer that\n\nplaintiff['s] constitutionally protected conduct -- in this case,\n\npolitical affiliation with the NPP -- was a 'substantial' or\n\n'motivating' factor behind [her] dismissal.\"                Acevedo-Diaz v.\n\nAponte, 1 F.3d 62, 66 (1st Cir. 1993); see also Figueroa-Serrano,\n\n221 F.3d at 7 (citing Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429\n\nU.S. 274 (1977)) (\"To prevail on a free speech claim, a public\n\nemployee must show that she engaged in constitutionally-protected\n\nconduct and that this conduct was a substantial factor in the\n\nadverse employment decision.\").       The plaintiff bears the burden of\n\npersuasion on these issues throughout the case.\n\n           The defendant, of course, may offer rebuttal evidence to\n\nattempt to disprove that political affiliation played a substantial\n\nrole in the adverse employment action.       Additionally, even if the\n\nplaintiff establishes that proposition by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence, the defendant may raise an affirmative defense: it may\n\nattempt   to   \"prove   by   a   preponderance   of   the    evidence   that\n\nplaintiff[] would have been dismissed regardless of [her] political\n\naffiliation.\"    Acevedo-Diaz, 1 F.3d at 66; see also Mt. Healthy,\n\n429 U.S. at 287; Sanchez-Lopez v. Fuentes-Pujols, 375 F.3d 121, 124\n\n(1st Cir. 2004). In other words, even if the plaintiff has shown\n\nthat her political affiliation was a substantial or motivating\n\n\nat issue here.\n\n                                    -14-\n\ffactor in the adverse employment decision, the defendant will not\n\nbe held liable if it can persuade the factfinder that it would have\n\ntaken   the    same      course          of   action   anyway,     without   regard   to\n\nplaintiff's political affiliation.                     The Supreme Court has made\n\nclear that defendant’s Mt. Healthy defense serves to prevent an\n\nemployee who would have received an adverse employment decision\n\nbased on legitimate reasons from being \"in a better position as a\n\nresult of the exercise of constitutionally protected conduct than\n\nhe would have occupied had he done nothing.\"                     Mt. Healthy, 429 U.S.\n\nat   285.      However,     if       a    plaintiff    does   not    produce   evidence\n\nsufficient         to   allow    a        reasonable    inference     that     political\n\ndiscrimination was a substantial or motivating factor in the\n\nchallenged employment action, we need not analyze defendant's Mt.\n\nHealthy defense.         Accordingly, we turn now to evaluating whether\n\nplaintiff produced sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to\n\nfind that her political affiliation was a substantial or motivating\n\ncause of her demotion and alleged constructive discharge.\n\n              C.    The Evidence Adduced at Trial\n\n              We will reverse a jury verdict in a case such as this\n\n\"only if: (1) the record evidence compelled the conclusion that the\n\nplaintiff      would      have           been    dismissed    in     any     event    for\n\nnondiscriminatory reasons [in other words, the Mt. Healthy defense\n\nprevails as a matter of law], or (2) the plaintiff did not\n\nintroduce sufficient evidence in the first instance to shift the\n\n\n                                                -15-\n\fburden of persuasion to the defendants.\"            Acevedo-Diaz, 1 F.3d at\n\n67.   Here, we are presented with the rare case that requires\n\nreversing a jury verdict on appeal because plaintiff's evidence\n\nfailed to establish that political discrimination was a substantial\n\nor motivating factor in the challenged employment action.               Because\n\nthe court's dismissal of the due process claim was not appealed, we\n\ninclude in our analysis only testimony relevant to the First\n\nAmendment claim.\n\n                 1.   Plaintiff's Witnesses\n\n            Plaintiff offered testimony from four witnesses: (1)\n\nMaría Sánchez Coraliza (\"Sánchez\"), Assistant Director of the Human\n\nResources   Office    and   author     of   both   the    1991   and   1997   job\n\nclassification plans; (2) David Córdova Torrech (\"Córdova\"), now\n\nretired after fourteen years of municipal service that included\n\nserving as director of the Citizen's Office for the Mayor and as\n\nVázquez's direct supervisor; (3) Linda E. Rivera Vega (\"Rivera\"),\n\nwho   was   purchasing      and   procurement      bids    director    for     the\n\nmunicipality during six months relevant to this litigation; and (4)\n\nVázquez herself.\n\n                       a.    Sánchez\n\n            Sánchez   testified      that   when   she    became   aware      that\n\nSantiago was considering rescinding the 1997 plan and restoring\n\nstaffing in accordance with the 1991 plan, she told him \"that I did\n\nnot believe that he should take upon himself to do the action that\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fhe   intended    to    do    .   .   .   since   there   were   explanations   for\n\neverything that had taken place and that could entail certain\n\nemployees might sue him and that he might have to appear in court.\"\n\nAccording to Sánchez, Santiago replied that \"if he had to go to\n\ncourt and the court assigned him to pay, that he would pay.\"\n\nSánchez further testified that she advised him that \"the 1997 plan\n\nhad been approved by a municipality ordinance and that he should\n\nseek guidance in that sense.\"\n\n           In answer to questions about how many employees were\n\nswitched from career employee status to transitory employee status\n\nas a result of the Mayor's decision to rescind the 1997 plan,\n\nSánchez   could       not    give    a   numerical   estimate.      Instead,   she\n\nmentioned some names of affected people whom she personally knew.\n\nAfter listing five people by name and saying that she \"would have\n\nto mention a whole bunch of them because there were many,\" Sánchez\n\ntestified that \"all these people\" belonged to the NPP.\n\n           Plaintiff also elicited testimony from Sánchez regarding\n\nVázquez's qualifications for the positions to which she had been\n\nappointed.      In sum, Sánchez testified that Vázquez was qualified\n\nfor all the positions she had held at the municipality.                 However,\n\nSánchez   admitted          on   cross-examination       that   Commonwealth   law\n\nrequires, with some exceptions, that before a position is filled it\n\nmust be posted or advertised; that the vacancy must be filled using\n\na system called the \"register of eligible\" or some alternative\n\n\n                                          -17-\n\fequivalent    system;     that    the    hired   personnel     must   serve    a\n\nprobationary period of three to six months; and that an employee\n\nmay only become a career employee after satisfactorily completing\n\nthe probationary period.         Sánchez also testified on cross that the\n\nmunicipality had not followed these hiring procedures as a general\n\nmatter.\n\n                         b.   Córdova\n\n            Córdova, director of the Citizen's Office for the Mayor\n\nand Vázquez's direct supervisor, testified to Vázquez's increasing\n\nresponsibilities and growth as an employee during her tenure with\n\nhim.   During Vázquez's thirteen years under Córdova, he made two\n\nwritten evaluations of her job performance.              Additionally, Córdova\n\nexplained that he petitioned the former mayor to appoint Vázquez as\n\nAssistant Director of a branch of the Citizen's Office.                       For\n\npurposes of our appellate review, we will assume that Córdova's\n\ntestimony regarding Vázquez's job responsibilities established that\n\nshe met the minimum stated requirements for the positions of\n\nSecretary    III   and    Assistant      Director   (a    position    that    was\n\nessentially renamed Executive Director II in 1997).\n\n                         c.   Rivera\n\n            Rivera, a member of the PDP, testified that she told\n\nDelgado \"that I am a person who under no circumstances will\n\npersecute anyone because as she [Delgado] knows, I have been\n\npersecuted for more than seventeen years by the NPPers and the\n\n\n                                        -18-\n\fPopulares [PDP party members] who have allowed that I be persecuted\n\nand that I would under no circumstances would [sic] allow that and\n\nif   I    saw     anything   or    understood     that    there    would   be     any\n\npersecution, that I would rather resign and that is what I did.\"\n\n                Rivera   also     testified    about     her   understanding      and\n\nobservations of political persecution during her time at the\n\nmunicipality.        She explained her \"understanding that persecution\n\ninvolves leaving an employee without work,\" and when Rivera passed\n\nVázquez's desk, she often observed that Vázquez had no work to do.\n\nRivera made the same observation about one other employee.                         In\n\nconsequence, Rivera told the municipal secretary, Dora Martinez\n\nTorres (\"Martinez\"),10 to \"'watch out,' because since she belongs\n\nto another party, and was not giving them any work it could be\n\nunderstood that it was political persecution.\"                   Rivera said that\n\nMartinez was a member of the PDP and that she began work after the\n\nnew administration took office.               Additionally, she explained that\n\nwhile at first she did not have an adverse relationship with\n\nMartinez,       their    working    relationship    later      soured   because    of\n\nMartinez's \"persecution with the employees.\"\n\n                According to Rivera, she used to have lunch with Martinez\n\nand Delgado, but \"upon seeing that they thought differently than\n\nthe way I thought, well, then I understood that it was best not to\n\nhave lunch to avoid taking any decisions, well, leave my job, be a\n\n\n     10\n          Martinez is not a party in this case.\n\n                                        -19-\n\fpart of a persecution, and remarks that might be out of order.\"\n\nWhen pressed as to what Delgado specifically said that convinced\n\nRivera that they should no longer lunch together, Rivera said that\n\n\"[o]ne of Mrs. Delgado's remarks had to do with the process when\n\nletters were to be delivered that there would be equality -- let's\n\nsay that the salaries were going to be lowered or if their\n\npermanency was going to be removed, well, then it would be the same\n\nfor everyone notwithstanding the person involved.\"11           Later, Rivera\n\ntestified that she and Delgado had lunch together perhaps two or\n\nthree times and that they did not talk about politics.\n\n            Rivera was asked whether she \"could tell the jury if the\n\nmembers of the New Progressive Party employees were targeted for\n\nthis personnel action\" of receiving the reassignment letters.\n\nRivera    replied:   \"Yes,    because     the    employees   who   were   given\n\npermanence in '97, well, those were the employees who would be\n\nsubjected to the application of the law in which their permanence\n\nwould be taken away from them.\"         Upon prompting, Rivera said that\n\nthose employees belonged to the NPP party.\n\n                         d.   Vázquez\n\n            Vázquez was on the stand for three days.          In addition to\n\ndetailing   her   work    history   and    the    responsibilities    of   her\n\n\n\n     11\n      Plaintiff's counsel asked whether the translation might be\nmore accurate as \"regardless of the pressure involved\" instead of\n\"regardless of the person involved.\" The court replied that it\n\"had no objection to that.\"\n\n                                    -20-\n\femployment    with   the     municipality,    Vázquez    testified   that   her\n\nacademic preparation and experiences qualified her for all of the\n\nmunicipal positions that she had held. Vázquez also testified that\n\nher   immediate      supervisor,    Martinez,     both     made    politically\n\ndiscriminatory remarks, including stating that \"[w]ell, hopefully\n\nthey will kill all the NPPers\" and failed to give her any work from\n\nJanuary to August of 2001.          On August 24, 2001, Vázquez sent a\n\nletter and an accompanying table to Martinez detailing her work\n\nassignments since January 15, 2001 (excluding one month of vacation\n\nand one month of sick leave over the seven-month period).                   The\n\nletter informed Martinez that of the remaining five months of that\n\nperiod, Vázquez performed tasks on forty-two of the 106 work days.\n\nOn cross-examination, Vázquez admitted that she never informed\n\nDelgado or Santiago of her lack of work, saying that it is \"not the\n\nmechanism, and that would be gossip.\"           She further admitted that\n\nafter Martinez received her letter of August 24, Vázquez was given\n\nsufficient work to occupy her work days.\n\n             Vázquez testified about the meeting on May 22 when\n\nbetween   fifteen      and     eighteen     employees    were     given   their\n\nreassignment letters.         She said that all of the employees at the\n\nmeeting were members of the NPP who \"held positions of hierarchy in\n\nthe previous administration.\"         According to Vázquez, \"the Mayor\n\nbegan the meeting indicating that he was the person in power, that\n\nthe Popular Democratic Party had won.             That they had to adopt\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\factions with employees, that they had to clean house and that they\n\nwere going to deliver letters to us in which there would be changes\n\nin our salaries or our permanence; that whomever wished to go to\n\nJASAP had 30 days to do so, that whomever wished to go through\n\nattorneys, well, they then had to bear the consequences of their\n\nactions and that we would see each other in Court.\"12           Vázquez\n\ncontinued recounting the events of the meeting, noting that Delgado\n\n\"began indicating that she was seconding what the Mayor had stated\n\nand she explained the appeals process.\"\n\n             Vázquez also recounted the details of what appears to be\n\nthe   only   other   time   she   met   Santiago.   When   Santiago   was\n\ncampaigning and seeking votes, he visited the community where\n\nVázquez lived.    According to Vázquez, \"[h]e came up the stairs.      At\n\nthat point he introduced himself as a candidate for the Popular\n\nDemocratic Party and at that point I told him that I belonged to\n\nthe New Progressive Party, that I campaigned for the NPP from 1984.\n\nThat I was a militant and that I had held assorted positions with\n\nthe administration of Mayor Victor Soto and as all candidates he\n\ntold me that he was counting on my vote.\"      Plaintiff's counsel then\n\nasked Vázquez whether Santiago \"was able to recognize you that you\n\n\n      12\n      Santiago disputes that he said that they were going to \"clean\nhouse.\" Instead, Santiago testified that at the May 22 meeting, he\nsaid that \"it is my obligation [to] correct what the previous\nadministration did wrong and that . . . very much in spite of what\nI might want to do, I had to do it morally.\" Of course, under the\nRule 50 standard, we credit Vázquez's version of events over\nSantiago's for purposes of our analysis here.\n\n                                   -22-\n\fwere a member of the New Progressive Party\" at the May 22 meeting.\n\nVázquez responded, \"He shook hands with me and greeted me.\"\n\n            Vázquez also testified about her activity on behalf of\n\nthe NPP.    She had been an electoral college officer since the age\n\nof eighteen and president of the committee for her local ward in\n\nToa Baja.     Vázquez participated in mobilization, fundraising,\n\norganizing, and \"all kinds of activities related to politics and\n\nthe NPP.\"\n\n                  2.   Defendants' Uncontradicted Testimony\n\n            Before considering this testimony, we observe that a\n\nstrong case could be made that defendants' motion for judgment as\n\na matter of law at the close of plaintiff's case should have been\n\ngranted.    Of course, defendants do not make this argument on\n\nappeal. Having put on a defense at trial, they are foreclosed from\n\ndoing so.   See Gillentine v. McKeand, 426 F.2d 717, 723 (1st Cir.\n\n1970) (\"defendant's motion for a directed verdict at the close of\n\nplaintiff's case expired\" upon the introduction of substantial\n\ndefense evidence and was not preserved for appeal).          Accordingly,\n\nin evaluating defendants' appeal from the district court's denial\n\nof their motion for judgment as a matter of law after the close of\n\nall   evidence,   we   consider   both    plaintiff's   evidence   and   the\n\nuncontroverted evidence offered by defendants.           Santiago-Negron,\n\n865 F.2d at 445.\n\n                       a.   Delgado\n\n\n                                   -23-\n\f             Delgado testified that at the time of transition between\n\nthe two administrations, the municipality had 1,343 employees on\n\nits roster.        Delgado's uncontradicted testimony also established\n\nthat there was no evidence in Vázquez's personnel file establishing\n\nthat Vázquez met the minimum requirements for appointment to\n\nSecretary    III    or   Assistant     Director,    or    that   she   served   the\n\nrequisite    probationary     period       for   either   position.13     Delgado\n\ntestified that according to the documents in Vázquez's personnel\n\nfile,     Vázquez    lacked   the    commercial     or    secretarial    training\n\nrequired to be appointed to Secretary III in 1993.                      On cross,\n\nplaintiff's counsel drew Delgado's attention to Córdova's letter\n\nasking that Vázquez be appointed to Secretary III, which, taking\n\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, could\n\nestablish her eligibility for the position.                  Upon questioning,\n\nDelgado testified that she cannot explain why that document was not\n\ncontained in Vázquez's personnel file.\n\n             Delgado further testified that Vázquez's personnel file\n\ncontained     no    indication      that   the   Human    Resources     Department\n\nfollowed the procedures and analysis required to reclassify an\n\nemployee, without competition for the position, based on the\n\n\n     13\n      We do not make this point to question Vazquez's\nqualifications for her positions. As noted in our discussion of\nCórdova's testimony, we have assumed that she met the stated\nqualifications for the positions of Secretary III and Assistant\nDirector. We simply make the point here that anyone reviewing her\npersonnel file would not find evidence of these qualifications in\nthe file.\n\n                                       -24-\n\femployee's    assumption     of   greater   responsibility   and   obtaining\n\nfurther credentials.\n\n                        b.   Santiago\n\n          In uncontradicted testimony from Santiago, he explained\n\nthat he sought advice regarding the effect and legality of the 1997\n\nplan, and that he acted on that advice.         As noted, the evidentiary\n\nrulings below prevented the defense from putting before the jury\n\nthe nature of the advice the defendants received.\n\n             Santiago   further     testified   that   of    the   municipal\n\nemployees who received letters adjusting their status, \"nearly half\n\nof them, their salaries have increased, others have gone down.\" He\n\nalso testified that he retained several members of the opposing\n\nparty in trust positions after he took office and that he took only\n\none of his people into the mayor's office with him.            According to\n\nSantiago, \"the rest of them, I honored their position and I allowed\n\nthem to remain, despite the fact that it's a high confidentiality\n\nposition . . . .\"\n\n             Santiago was asked on cross-examination whether he knew\n\nthe party of the employees who lost permanent status and became\n\ntransitory employees by virtue of declaring the 1997 plan void. He\n\nreplied that \"[t]here are members of all three parties.\"                When\n\npressed for an estimated percentage break-down among the parties,\n\nSantiago could not provide one, but he agreed that there were more\n\nNPP members than PDP members in that group.            When counsel asked\n\n\n                                     -25-\n\fwhether it is \"a true fact that, more or less, from 75 to 80\n\npercent of the employees of Tao Baja are members of the New\n\nProgressive       Party,\"     Santiago    agreed    that    \"[t]hat       might    be.\"\n\nAccording    to    Santiago’s     uncontradicted      testimony,       he    had    not\n\nappointed anyone to a career position since he took office.\n\n            D.     Topical Summary of the Evidence\n\n            On     topics     important     to     establishing       a     political\n\ndiscrimination claim, the evidence that we have reviewed through\n\nthe Rule 50 lens establishes the following propositions.\n\n                    1.   Personnel Actions\n\n            Defendants rescinded the 1997 plan and reassigned several\n\nhundred employees, including Vázquez, in accordance with the 1991\n\nplan.    Sánchez testified that she advised Santiago to seek advice\n\nbefore    deciding       to    rescind     the     1997     plan.          Santiago's\n\nuncontradicted testimony was that he did indeed seek such advice.\n\nAs we have described, the nature of that advice was kept from the\n\njury at trial.\n\n            Sánchez testified that the people whom she knew who were\n\naffected by the reclassification plan were NPP members.                        Rivera\n\nalso    testified    that     affected    employees       belonged    to    the    NPP.\n\nHowever, the kind of personnel review undertaken by defendants\n\nnecessarily would impact more NPP members because of the long\n\ndominance of the NPP over municipal affairs.                   Indeed, Santiago\n\nagreed with plaintiff's counsel that approximately seventy-five to\n\n\n                                         -26-\n\feighty percent of the employees of Toa Baja are members of the NPP,\n\nand Rivera herself explained, \"because the employees who were given\n\npermanence in '97 [when the NPP had been in control of the city\n\ngovernment for over twenty years], well, those were the employees\n\nwho would be subjected to the application of the law in which their\n\npermanence would be taken away from them.\"\n\n            Santiago's uncontradicted testimony was that nearly half\n\nof   the   employees    affected   by   the   personnel   changes     actually\n\nreceived    higher     salaries.     Plaintiff    neither   rebutted     this\n\ntestimony nor offered any evidence that there was a disparity -- by\n\npolitical affiliation or otherwise -- between those who received\n\nhigher salaries and those who received lower salaries under the new\n\nreclassifications.14\n\n                 2.     Treatment of Vázquez\n\n            Vázquez lacked sufficient work to occupy her time from\n\nJanuary through August 2001 (less the two months when she was on\n\nleave).    When Vázquez sent a letter to her immediate supervisor,\n\nMartinez, detailing her lack of work projects during this time,\n\nMartinez began assigning Vázquez adequate work.              Additionally,\n\nVázquez    was   demoted    from   Executive     Director   II   to    Office\n\n\n\n      14\n      As we recently explained in Sanchez-Lopez, while \"there is\nsimply not a claim of 'disparate impact' available under this First\nAmendment doctrine\" of political retaliation, evidence that \"all of\nthe employees affected by defendants' actions were NPP members\"\nmight   be    considered   evidence   that   defendants    harbored\ndiscriminatory animus. Sanchez-Lopez, 375 F.3d at 140.\n\n                                    -27-\n\fWorker/Typist I effective February 1, 2002.               A hearing officer\n\nfound that the reassignment was valid because Vázquez previously\n\nhad been illegally hired and promoted.\n\n           Sánchez    and   Córdova    testified   that    Vázquez   met   the\n\nminimum qualifications for each of the positions to which she had\n\nbeen appointed.      However, Sánchez admitted that the municipality\n\ngenerally did not follow the procedural requirements for personnel\n\nactions.   Plaintiff never offered any clear evidence or testimony\n\nthat her appointments either met these procedural requirements or\n\nwere eligible for an exception to any of the requirements.                  In\n\nfact, Vázquez admitted that she was promoted without going through\n\nthe regular competitive process or serving the normally required\n\nprobationary   period.        Furthermore,    Delgado's      uncontradicted\n\ntestimony was that there was no material in Vázquez's personnel\n\nfile to show either that the procedural requirements were followed\n\nor that Vázquez's appointments were eligible for an exception to\n\nthe usual procedural requirements.\n\n           Taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\nplaintiff, Vázquez arguably established that she did not need to\n\ncomply with the normal appointment procedures when she assumed the\n\nposition of Executive Director II because that position was simply\n\na reclassification of the position of Assistant Director. However,\n\nVázquez's demotion to Office Worker/Typist I was premised on the\n\nalleged illegality of her appointment to Secretary III, not on any\n\n\n                                      -28-\n\fineligibility to be reassigned from Assistant Director to Executive\n\nDirector II.\n\n                   3.   Statements of Discriminatory Intent\n\n             At the May 22 meeting, where fifteen to eighteen NPP\n\nemployees received letters adjusting their positions within the\n\nmunicipality, the Mayor stated that the \"Popular Democratic Party\n\nhad won.     That they had to adopt actions with employees, that they\n\nhad to clean house and that they were going to deliver letters to\n\nus   in    which   there    would    be    changes   in   our   salaries     or    our\n\npermanence . . . .\"15         Plaintiff presented evidence of one other\n\nstatement evincing discriminatory intent or animus:                        Martinez,\n\nplaintiff’s direct supervisor and a non-party in this case, said at\n\na gathering something like \"[w]ell, hopefully they will kill all\n\nthe NPPers.\"\n\n                   4.   Rivera's Perception of Political Retaliation\n\n             Rivera,    a   member    of    the   PDP,    offered   what    is    best\n\ncharacterized as lay opinion testimony: she thought political\n\nretaliation was occurring in her department under Martinez, based\n\non her observation that Vázquez and one other employee were not\n\nfully occupied with work, at least for some period of time.                  Rivera\n\ntestified that \"if I saw anything or understood that there would be\n\nany persecution, that I would rather resign and that is what I\n\n\n      15\n      Again, we note that although this evidence is contradicted\nby Santiago’s testimony, we take it as true for purposes of the\nRule 50 analysis.\n\n                                          -29-\n\fdid.\"   Additionally, Rivera said at one point that after having\n\nlunch with        Delgado   and    Martinez,   she   saw   \"that   they   thought\n\ndifferently than the way I thought.\"             There is also an ambiguous\n\nreference to \"remarks that might be out of order\" in Rivera’s\n\ntestimony.        Rivera also testified that her relationship with\n\nMartinez soured over Rivera's perception of political persecution\n\nin the workplace.\n\n             However, Rivera also testified that she and Delgado did\n\nnot talk about politics, and that the only political comment\n\nDelgado made to her was one that \"had to do with the process when\n\nletters were to be delivered that there would be equality -- let's\n\nsay that the salaries were going to be lowered or if their\n\npermanency was going to be removed, well, then it would be the same\n\nfor everyone notwithstanding the person [or regardless of the\n\npressure] involved.\"         This testimony by plaintiff's own witness\n\nestablishes that Delgado             indicated that the reclassifications\n\nwould be done with \"equality\" and that changes in permanence or\n\nsalaries would be implemented regardless of the people affected (or\n\nthe pressure involved).           This testimony -- elicited by plaintiff's\n\ncounsel during her case-in-chief -- supports defendants' claims\n\nthat they implemented the reclassifications in a neutral manner.\n\n             E.    Analysis of the Evidence\n\n          This evidence is not sufficient to show that plaintiff's\n\npolitical affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor in\n\n\n                                       -30-\n\fdefendants' decision to reclassify her under the 1991 plan.               In\n\nfact, the evidence presented at trial does not create a reasonable\n\ninference that defendants were even aware of Vázquez’s political\n\naffiliation at the time her personnel file was reviewed and she was\n\nreassigned according to the 1991 plan.       We encountered a factually\n\nsimilar situation in Gonzáles-De Blasini v. Family Dept., 377 F.3d\n\n81 (1st Cir. 2004).   There, we affirmed dismissal of a plaintiff's\n\npolitical discrimination claim because plaintiff\n\n           adduced no evidence that the defendants knew\n           she was a member of the NPP. She attempts to\n           bolster her political discrimination cause of\n           action by alleging that [defendants] must have\n           been aware of her political affiliation\n           because she was a well-known supporter of the\n           NPP in the community, had held a previous\n           trust position under the NPP administration,\n           and was allegedly demoted shortly after the\n           PDP assumed power. [Plaintiff] points to\n           [defendant's]   statement   that  she   wanted\n           [plaintiff's] office and position to go to an\n           employee of her trust as indication of a\n           causal link between her political beliefs and\n           the change in her employment conditions.\n\nId. at 85-86.   In Gonzáles-De Blasini, we held that such evidence\n\nwas   \"insufficient   to   show   that    political   affiliation   was    a\n\nsubstantial factor in the challenged employment action.\"            Id. at\n\n86.\n\n           Vázquez has shown no more here.       The fact that Santiago\n\nmet Vázquez during routine campaign canvassing, and that Vázquez\n\nthen identified herself as a member of the NPP and an employee of\n\nMayor Soto's, does not lead to a reasonable inference that Santiago\n\n\n                                   -31-\n\for Delgado knew that she was a member of the NPP when they\n\nconducted their review of all personnel files for irregularities or\n\nwhen they met with her on May 22 as part of a group.               Nor does\n\nVázquez’s testimony about her NPP activities or positions held\n\nunder the previous administration support such an inference.             Toa\n\nBaja is a city with almost 100,000 residents, and the city employed\n\napproximately 1,300 people.           While Vázquez did occupy a trust\n\nposition for about twenty months under Mayor Soto, she provided no\n\nevidence that her trust position was of such a high nature that\n\ndefendants necessarily would have known who she was and her party\n\naffiliation.      In fact, when asked on direct examination whether\n\nSantiago recognized her as an NPP member at the May 22 meeting,\n\nfive   or   six   months   after     Santiago   introduced   himself   while\n\ncampaigning, Vázquez did not answer in the affirmative.            Instead,\n\nshe stated only that \"[h]e shook hands with me and greeted me.\"\n\n            Even if a jury could reasonably infer that defendants\n\nknew that plaintiff was a member of the NPP, that still is\n\ninsufficient.       Proving   that    her    political   affiliation   was   a\n\nsubstantial or motivating factor in the adverse decision requires\n\nmore than \"[m]erely juxtaposing a protected characteristic --\n\nsomeone else's politics -- with the fact that the plaintiff was\n\ntreated unfairly.\" Correa-Martinez v. Arrillaga-Beléndez, 903 F.2d\n\n49, 58 (1st Cir. 1990).       Indeed, the evidence falls short of even\n\nshowing that Vázquez was treated \"unfairly.\" Regardless of whether\n\n\n                                      -32-\n\fshe met the minimum educational and experiential qualifications, a\n\ndisputed point on which we take Vázquez's version of events, the\n\nundisputed testimony establishes that Vázquez did not meet the\n\nstatutory procedural requirements -- such as applying for and being\n\ninterviewed   for   an    advertised   job   in   competition    with   other\n\ncandidates, or serving the required probationary period -- for the\n\nSecretary III and Assistant Director appointments. Plaintiff's own\n\nwitness, Sánchez, testified that the municipality simply did not\n\nhire personnel in accordance with these various provisions.\n\n          The mayor's alleged comment about \"cleaning house\" also\n\nis not sufficient to sustain plaintiff's burden.                In Figueroa-\n\nSerrano, a plaintiff testified that the mayor said that \"he was\n\ngoing to clean City Hall of most NPP employees. . . .\"             Figueroa-\n\nSerrano, 221 F.3d at 4.16     In granting defendants' summary judgment\n\nmotion, we observed that the plaintiffs relied on \"generalized\n\nassertions of the defendants' affiliation with the rival political\n\nparty\" and the enactment of a personnel policy change after the\n\nelections.    Id. at 8.    \"The only specific evidence that they offer\n\nis the sworn statement of a single plaintiff that [the mayor]\n\n\n\n     16\n      In Figueroa-Serrano, we found that plaintiffs failed to\nproffer sufficient evidence of political discrimination to defeat\na summary judgment motion.    Because the \"standard for granting\nsummary judgment 'mirrors' the standard for judgment as a matter of\nlaw, such that the 'inquiry under each is the same,'\" Reeves v.\nSanderson Plumbing Prod. Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 150 (2000) (citation\nomitted), we find our reasoning in Figueroa-Serrano instructive\nhere.\n\n                                   -33-\n\fvoiced his intention to rid City Hall of NPP employees.   They have\n\nfailed to provide names or other specific factual information\n\nsupporting their claim that the Municipality replaced them with new\n\nhires from the PDP.\"   Id.   We then characterized this evidence as\n\na \"meager showing\" and held that it was \"patently insufficient to\n\ngenerate a genuine issue of material fact on a causal connection\n\nbetween the political affiliation of the plaintiffs and the adverse\n\nemployment actions alleged.\"    Id.\n\n          Plaintiff has done no better here.      Indeed, Vázquez's\n\ntestimony regarding Santiago's \"cleaning house\" comment is even\n\nless forceful than the plaintiff's testimony in Figueroa-Serrano.\n\nThere, the mayor allegedly said specifically that he intended to\n\nget rid of NPP members.      Here, Vázquez did not even allege that\n\nkind of direct statement from Santiago.    In contrast to Vázquez's\n\ncase, we have upheld a district court's denial of motion for a\n\njudgment notwithstanding the verdict when the plaintiffs presented\n\n\"ample evidence that [the defendant mayor] (1) knew plaintiffs were\n\naffiliated with NPP, (2) vowed to rid the [municipal] government of\n\nNPP members, (3) gave instructions to 'chop off the heads of the\n\nNPP members,' and (4) told municipal employees to switch to the\n\nPDP.\"   Hiraldo-Cancel v. Aponte, 925 F.2d 10, 12 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\nVázquez has produced no comparable evidence here.\n\n          Importantly, Vázquez also offered no evidence that PDP\n\nmembers were hired to replace the reassigned NPP members. In fact,\n\n\n                                 -34-\n\fSantiago's uncontradicted testimony was that he had not appointed\n\nanyone to a career position since he took office.                   Vázquez also\n\noffered no evidence that the reassignments were effectuated in a\n\ndiscriminatory or differential manner, or that they were targeted\n\nat NPP employees.      Plaintiff's own witness, Rivera, stated that\n\nDelgado told her that if the result of reassigning people according\n\nto the 1991 plan was that it would be done with \"equality\" and if\n\n\"the salaries were going to be lowered or if their permanency was\n\ngoing to be removed, well, then it would be the same for everyone\n\nnotwithstanding    the     person   [or     regardless       of    the   pressure]\n\ninvolved.\"   The defendants presented uncontradicted testimony that\n\nthey were reviewing every personnel file in the municipality and\n\nthat members of all parties were affected by the reassignments.\n\nThese facts distinguish this case from the scenario presented in\n\nAcevedo-Garcia v. Monroig, 351 F.3d 547 (1st Cir. 2003).                    There,\n\n\"[p]laintiffs . . . produced evidence supporting their theory that\n\nthe   termination plan was implemented in a way designed to target\n\nmembers of the NPP while sparing most members of the PDP.                  Further,\n\nthe jury heard evidence that the vast majority of people hired with\n\nextra-municipal    funds      belonged    to   the   PDP.\"        Id. at   565-66.\n\nVázquez has made no such showing.\n\n          At first blush, the actions and statements by Martinez,\n\nVázquez's supervisor, are troublesome.           Martinez failed to provide\n\nadequate work     to   keep    Vázquez    occupied    for    five    months,   and\n\n\n                                     -35-\n\fMartinez also allegedly stated that \"[w]ell, hopefully they will\n\nkill all the NPPers.\"           However, Vázquez makes no showing as to why\n\ndefendants should be held liable for Martinez's actions.17                      Vázquez\n\nadmitted that she informed neither Delgado nor Santiago about her\n\nlack of work, and she admitted that Martinez gave her sufficient\n\nwork after Vázquez's memo of August 24, 2001.                    Vázquez offered no\n\nevidence that Martinez's actions reflected a municipal \"custom or\n\npractice [that] is so well settled and widespread that the policy-\n\nmaking officials of the municipality can be said to have either\n\nactual or constructive knowledge of it yet did nothing to end the\n\npractice.\"        Silva v. Worden, 130 F.3d 26, 31 (1st Cir. 1997)\n\n(quotations and citations omitted) (cited in Acevedo-Garcia v.\n\nMonroig, 30 F. Supp. 2d 141, 152 (D. P.R. 1998).                            Unlike in\n\nAcevedo-Garcia, where discriminating supervisors \"claimed to be\n\nacting      on   the     orders       of   'higher    up'   officials     within       the\n\nMunicipality,          including       [the    defendants],\"     id.,     Vázquez      has\n\nproduced no such evidence here.                  Furthermore, Martinez's alleged\n\ncomment     is   akin     to    the    kind    of    isolated   stray   remark       by   a\n\nnondecisionmaker that we have held has limited probative value in\n\nother contexts.          See, e.g., Gonzalez v. El Día, Inc., 304 F.3d 63\n\n(1st    Cir.     2002)    (explaining         that   in   the   context    of   an     age\n\ndiscrimination         claim,     \"'stray      workplace    remarks,'     as    well      as\n\n\n\n       17\n      For purposes of our analysis here, we will assume that\nMartinez's actions actually amount to political retaliation.\n\n                                              -36-\n\fstatements made either by nondecisionmakers or by decisionmakers\n\nnot involved in the decisional process, normally are insufficient,\n\nstanding alone, to establish either pretext or the requisite\n\ndiscriminatory animus\").         While Martinez was the decisionmaker\n\nregarding Vázquez's workload, plaintiff offered no testimony that\n\nMartinez was involved in any way in the decision to rescind the\n\n1997 plan as null and void or in the review of Vázquez's personnel\n\nfile and reassignment.\n\n           The plaintiff presented no evidence that Santiago or\n\nDelgado created an atmosphere of discrimination or a policy of\n\nleaving NPP employees without work, and she made no claim that\n\nMartinez was implementing any such policy during the months that\n\nVázquez had insufficient work. In fact, plaintiff's witness Rivera\n\ntestified that the fourteen NPP employees she supervised were\n\nalways provided with adequate work.               In sum, whatever problems\n\nVázquez   may   have    had   with    her    immediate    supervisor,    Vázquez\n\npresented no evidence that any comment or action by Martinez is\n\nfairly attributable to the defendants in this case, and, on these\n\nfacts, Martinez's statement is not probative of whether defendants\n\nacted with discriminatory animus.\n\n           In short, plaintiff failed to show that her political\n\naffiliation was a substantial or motivating factor in her demotion\n\nor   alleged    constructive         discharge.          Although     plaintiff's\n\nallegations     of     \"political     discrimination       can   be    built   on\n\n\n                                      -37-\n\fcircumstantial evidence of constitutionally suspect motivations\"\n\nfor the adverse employment action, Vázquez has offered only a mere\n\nscintilla of evidence of political discrimination.          Her evidence\n\ndoes not amount to \"the specific facts necessary to take the\n\nasserted   claim    out   of   the    realm   of   speculative,   general\n\nallegations.\"    Kauffman v. P.R. Tel. Co., 841 F.2d 1169, 1173 n.5\n\n(1st Cir. 1988).\n\n                                     III.\n\n           We do not set aside jury verdicts lightly. Nevertheless,\n\nwhen plaintiff fails to adduce sufficient evidence for a jury to\n\nreasonably infer that plaintiff's political affiliation was a\n\nsubstantial or motivating factor in an adverse employment action,\n\nwe must do so.     For the forgoing reasons, we vacate the judgment\n\nand order the entry of judgment for defendants.        The parties shall\n\nbear their own costs.\n\n           So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -38-\n\f",

Following the jury verdict awarding compensatory and punitive damages to V&#225;zquez, defendants seek the entry of judgment on their behalf as a matter of law or, in the alternative, a new trial.

Such an argument rarely prevails after a favorable jury verdict. However, having reviewed the record with care, we agree that it prevails here. Accordingly, we vacate the verdict and direct entry of judgment for defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Drawing on the evidence presented at trial, we begin by describing the background of this case. Except where noted, this background information is undisputed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Change of Administration and Alteration of the Job Classification Plan</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 7, 2000, general elections were held in Puerto Rico. In the municipality of Toa Baja, defendant Victor J. Santiago, the PDP candidate for mayor of Toa Baja, defeated the incumbent NPP candidate, Victor Soto, who had been mayor for sixteen years. In total, the NPP had controlled the municipal government of Toa Baja for twenty-four years prior to the 2000 election.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon taking office, the new administration apparently faced several challenges. Among them were issues related to personnel actions and human resources plans that were detailed in several documents, including an audit from the Comptroller of Puerto Rico, dated June 14, 2000; a letter from the Commonwealth's Central Office for the Administration of Personnel and Human Resources (known by its acronym \"OCALARH,\" which is based on the Spanish version of the office's name); and another letter from the Office of the Commissioner for Municipal Affairs (similarly known as \"OCAP\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> These documents addressed personnel issues of the municipality. In Puerto Rico, all municipal jobs are governed by so-called job classification plans that are adopted locally. These plans set forth the occupational groups and personnel structure of the municipality, including the primary responsibilities and employment requirements for each position in city government. The salaries for various jobs are set forth in a separate salary scale that establishes the salary for each job by classification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From time to time, municipalities revise their job classification plans. Toa Baja undertook this task in 1997, when it altered the then-existing job classification plan that had been adopted in 1991.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> According to the Comptroller's report, the 1997 changes were not valid alterations to the 1991 plan because they were not first submitted for approval to OCALARH, and past municipal administrations had appointed several hundred employees in violation of the relevant state law and regulations. The report also recommended both that the municipality put in place a system for the selection and recruitment of personnel and that the administration develop a corrective action plan to remedy the various illegalities cited therein.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants then undertook a review of the personnel files of all 1,300 or so municipal employees. Defendants claim that they did so because, according to the Comptroller's report, \"[n]ot addressing the recommendations of the audit ... without just cause[ ] may constitute a violation [of] ... the Government Ethics Act.\" Plaintiff maintains that the defendants sought to retaliate against members of the NPP. As of May 2002, at the time of the trial, around six hundred files had been evaluated, including V&#225;zquez's. Of those, 281 employees had sought an informal hearing regarding the personnel action that resulted from the review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>V&#225;zquez's Political Activity and Employment History</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">V&#225;zquez has been active in the NPP since the age of eighteen. She was president or chair of the NPP committee in her ward (Barrio Pajaros in Toa Baja), and she worked on the mobilization committee, organized rallies, and raised funds. Additionally, she was one of the NPP's electoral college officers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Her employment at the municipality of Toa Baja started in 1985, when V&#225;zquez was employed in a transitory position<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> as an office clerk. On February 1, 1989, she became a career employee in the position of Office Worker/Typist I at a monthly salary of $545. On July 1, 1993, V&#225;zquez was appointed to the position of Secretary III, with a monthly salary of $1019, at the request of David C&#243;rdova Torrech (\"C&#243;rdova\"), her immediate supervisor and head of the Office of Services to the Citizenry. Twenty days later, C&#243;rdova asked that V&#225;zquez be reassigned again, this time to the position of Assistant Director of the newly created Levittown branch of the Office of Services to the Citizenry. That request was granted, and V&#225;zquez assumed the position of Assistant Director on August 16, with a monthly salary of $1752.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1997, the alteration to the job classification plan eliminated the position of Assistant Director from the employment hierarchy. In the wake of that elimination, V&#225;zquez was reassigned to the position of Executive Director II. Two years later, in 1999, V&#225;zquez was appointed as an Administrative Assistant to Mayor Soto, a trust position within the administration. Following NPP's defeat at the polls in 2000, V&#225;zquez was reassigned to her former position of Executive Director II.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>V&#225;zquez's Demotion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 22, 2001, the defendants, Mayor Santiago and Director of Human Resources Delgado, held a meeting with fifteen to eighteen employees, including V&#225;zquez, to notify them that their classifications were being changed pursuant to the decision to declare the 1997 plan null and void and return to the 1991 classifications. According to V&#225;zquez, Santiago explained at that meeting that the PDP had won the election and, in V&#225;zquez's words, said that \"they had to adopt actions with employees, that they had to clean house....\" Santiago then explained that the affected employees had certain rights to administrative hearings and, again in V&#225;zquez's words, \"that whomever wished to go through attorneys, well, they then had to bear the consequences of their actions and that we would see each other in Court.\" V&#225;zquez testified that Delgado then took the floor, saying that she agreed with Santiago; Delgado then explained the appeals process to the reclassified employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following Delgado's explanation of the appeals process, the employees were handed letters describing their new classifications and explaining the reasons for the reclassifications. The letter to V&#225;zquez stated that she lacked the academic preparation or experience for her current position and was being reassigned to Office Worker/Typist I, the position she held in 1989. According to the defendants' review of her personnel file, that was the last position to which V&#225;zquez had validly been appointed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">V&#225;zquez attended a hearing in front of an administrative hearing officer on September 9, 2001.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> According to V&#225;zquez, the hearing lasted approximately five minutes. In January 2002, the hearing officer issued a report and recommendation to the effect that V&#225;zquez had been illegally hired and promoted. Although V&#225;zquez remained in the Executive Director II position at the monthly salary of $2083 pending the outcome of the hearing, she was officially reassigned to Office Worker/Typist I by letter of January 30, 2002. Her monthly salary was reduced accordingly to $900, effective February 1. On March 15, 2002, V&#225;zquez tendered her resignation to Santiago, effective April 9.

V&#225;zquez sued Santiago and Delgado in both their official and personal capacities. V&#225;zquez alleged that she was demoted and constructively discharged, and that these adverse employment actions violated her First Amendment and due process rights under the United States Constitution. In her complaint, she sought compensatory and punitive damages, as well as reinstatement. The defendants denied the allegations and replied that V&#225;zquez was illegally appointed to her position with the city and that they were obligated to correct the irregularity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 27, 2002, prior to trial, the defendants moved for summary judgment, with Santiago and Delgado raising the affirmative defense of qualified immunity in their individual capacities. The district court denied the motion. A jury trial began on April 30, 2002. At the close of all evidence, defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50, arguing that V&#225;zquez did not produce sufficient evidence to show (1) that her due process rights were violated, (2) that her political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor for her demotion, or (3) that she was constructively discharged. The district court granted defendants' Rule 50 motion as to the due process claim but denied it in all other respects, including the qualified immunity defense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 14, the jury found for plaintiff, awarding her $275,000 in compensatory damages for mental and emotional pain and suffering, $6,828 in compensatory damages for lost earnings, and $42,000 in punitive damages, for a total of $323,828, plus post-judgment interest, reasonable costs, and attorney's fees.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> In light of the jury finding that the defendants discriminated against V&#225;zquez on the basis of her political affiliation and the jury's award of punitive damages, the district court rejected Santiago's and Delgado's affirmative defense of qualified immunity. The district court then denied defendants' post-trial Rule 59 motion, which asked the court to set aside the compensatory and punitive damages as excessive and without a sound evidentiary basis. The district court also ordered the defendants to reinstate V&#225;zquez to her previous position of Executive Director II.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants raise several arguments on appeal. First, they urge that the district court erred in denying their Rule 50 motion as to the political discrimination claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Second, defendants argue that the district court erred in denying admissibility of the Comptroller's report and agency letters, which defendants maintain were crucial to substantiating that political discrimination was not a factor in V&#225;zquez's reassignment. Third, defendants claim that the trial court made allegedly prejudicial remarks in front of the jury. Fourth, defendants assert that the district court erred in ordering plaintiff reinstated to her previous position of Executive Director II. Finally, in their individual capacity, defendants challenge the district court's denial of the qualified immunity defense. Because of our disposition of the sufficiency of the evidence claim, we do not reach defendants' other arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Standard of Review</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The standard for setting aside a jury verdict pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(b) is a stringent one: \"[W]e must examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and determine whether there are facts and inferences reasonably drawn from those facts which lead to but one conclusion &#8212; that there is a total failure of evidence to prove plaintiff's case.\" <i>Mayo v.

In reviewing the record, we will evaluate neither the credibility of the witnesses nor the weight of the evidence. <i>Santiago-Negron v. Castro-Davila,</i> 865 F.2d 431, 445 (1st Cir.1989). Even though we draw all rational inferences from the facts in favor of plaintiff, \"the plaintiff is not entitled to inferences based on speculation and conjecture.\" <i>Ferrer v. Zayas,</i> 914 F.2d 309, 311 (1st Cir.1990). A non-moving party who bears the burden of proof, as V&#225;zquez does here, must have presented \"more than a mere scintilla of evidence in its favor\" to withstand a motion for judgment as a matter of law. <i>Invest Almaz v.

Ramos-Alverio,</i> 221 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.2000) (citing <i>Branti v. Finkel,</i> 445 U.S. 507, 517-19, 100 S.Ct. 1287, 63 L.Ed.2d 574 (1980), and <i>Rutan v. Republican Party of Illinois,</i> 497 U.S. 62, 75, 110 S.Ct. 2729, 111 L.Ed.2d 52 (1990)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> When a plaintiff brings a political discrimination claim, she bears the burden of \"producing sufficient direct or circumstantial evidence from which a jury reasonably may infer that plaintiff['s] constitutionally protected conduct &#8212; in this case, political affiliation with the NPP &#8212; was a `substantial' or `motivating' factor behind [her] dismissal.\" <i>Acevedo-Diaz v. Aponte,</i> 1 F.3d 62, 66 (1st Cir.1993); <i>see also Figueroa-Serrano,</i> 221 F.3d at 7 (citing <i>Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle,</i> 429 U.S. 274, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977)) (\"To prevail on a free speech claim, a public employee must show that she engaged in constitutionally-protected conduct and that this conduct was a substantial factor in the adverse employment decision.\"). The plaintiff bears the burden of persuasion on these issues throughout the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant, of course, may offer rebuttal evidence to attempt to disprove that political affiliation played a substantial role in the adverse employment action. Additionally, even if the plaintiff establishes that proposition by a preponderance of the evidence, the defendant may raise an affirmative defense: it may attempt to \"prove by a preponderance of the evidence that plaintiff[ ] would have been dismissed regardless of [her] political affiliation.\" <i>Acevedo-Diaz,</i> 1 F.3d at 66; <i>see also Mt. Healthy,</i> 429 U.S. at 287, 97 S.Ct. 568; <i>Sanchez-Lopez v. Fuentes-Pujols,</i> 375 F.3d 121, 124 (1st Cir.2004). In other words, even if the plaintiff has shown that her political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment decision, the defendant will not be held liable if it can persuade the factfinder that it would have taken the same course of action anyway, without regard to plaintiff's political affiliation. The Supreme Court has made clear that defendant's <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense serves to prevent an employee who would have received an adverse employment decision based on legitimate reasons from being \"in a better position as a result of the exercise of constitutionally protected conduct than he would have occupied had he done nothing.\" <i>Mt. Healthy,</i> 429 U.S. at 285, 97 S.Ct. 568. However, if a plaintiff does not produce evidence sufficient to allow a reasonable inference that political discrimination was a substantial or motivating factor in the challenged employment action, we need not analyze defendant's <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense. Accordingly, we turn now to evaluating whether plaintiff produced sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that her political affiliation was a substantial or motivating cause of her demotion and alleged constructive discharge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>The Evidence Adduced at Trial</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will reverse a jury verdict in a case such as this \"only if: (1) the record evidence compelled the conclusion that the plaintiff would have been dismissed in any event for nondiscriminatory reasons [in other words, the <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense prevails as a matter of law], or (2) the plaintiff did not introduce sufficient evidence in the first instance to shift the burden of persuasion to the defendants.\" <i>Acevedo-Diaz,</i> 1 F.3d at 67. Here, we are presented with the rare case that requires reversing a jury verdict on appeal because plaintiff's evidence failed to establish that political discrimination was a substantial or motivating factor in the challenged employment action. Because the court's dismissal of the due process claim was not appealed, we include in our analysis only testimony relevant to the First Amendment claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">1. <i>Plaintiff's Witnesses</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff offered testimony from four witnesses: (1) Maria Sanchez Coraliza (\"Sanchez\"), Assistant Director of the Human Resources Office and author of both the 1991 and 1997 job classification plans; (2) David Cordova Torrech (\"Cordova\"), now retired after fourteen years of municipal service that included serving as director of the Citizen's Office for the Mayor and as Vazquez's direct supervisor; (3) Linda E. Rivera Vega (\"Rivera\"), who was purchasing and procurement bids director for the municipality during six months relevant to this litigation; and (4) Vazquez herself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">a. <i>Sanchez</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sanchez testified that when she became aware that Santiago was considering rescinding the 1997 plan and restoring staffing in accordance with the 1991 plan, she told him \"that I did not believe that he should take upon himself to do the action that he intended to do ... since there were explanations for everything that had taken place and that could entail certain employees might sue him and that he might have to appear in court.\" According to Sanchez, Santiago replied that \"if he had to go to court and the court assigned him to pay, that he would pay.\" Sanchez further testified that she advised him that \"the 1997 plan had been approved by a municipality ordinance and that he should seek guidance in that sense.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In answer to questions about how many employees were switched from career employee status to transitory employee status as a result of the Mayor's decision to rescind the 1997 plan, Sanchez could not give a numerical estimate. Instead, she mentioned some names of affected people whom she personally knew. After listing five people by name and saying that she \"would have to mention a whole bunch of them because there were many,\" Sanchez testified that \"all these people\" belonged to the NPP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff also elicited testimony from Sanchez regarding Vazquez's qualifications for the positions to which she had been appointed. In sum, Sanchez testified that Vazquez was qualified for all the positions she had held at the municipality. However, Sanchez admitted on cross-examination that Commonwealth law requires, with some exceptions, that before a position is filled it must be posted or advertised; that the vacancy must be filled using a system called the \"register of eligible\" or some alternative equivalent system; that the hired personnel must serve a probationary period of three to six months; and that an employee may only become a career employee after satisfactorily completing the probationary period. Sanchez also testified on cross that the municipality had not followed these hiring procedures as a general matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">b. <i>Cordova</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cordova, director of the Citizen's Office for the Mayor and Vazquez's direct supervisor, testified to Vazquez's increasing responsibilities and growth as an employee during her tenure with him. During Vazquez's thirteen years under Cordova, he made two written evaluations of her job performance. Additionally, Cordova explained that he petitioned the former mayor to appoint Vazquez as Assistant Director of a branch of the Citizen's Office. For purposes of our appellate review, we will assume that Cordova's testimony regarding Vazquez's job responsibilities established that she met the minimum stated requirements for the positions of Secretary III and Assistant Director (a position that was essentially renamed Executive Director II in 1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">c. <i>Rivera</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera, a member of the PDP, testified that she told Delgado \"that I am a person who under no circumstances will persecute anyone because as she [Delgado] knows, I have been persecuted for more than seventeen years by the NPPers and the Populares [PDP party members] who have allowed that I be persecuted and that I would under no circumstances would [sic] allow that and if I saw anything or understood that there would be any persecution, that I would rather resign and that is what I did.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera also testified about her understanding and observations of political persecution during her time at the municipality. She explained her \"understanding that persecution involves leaving an employee without work,\" and when Rivera passed Vazquez's desk, she often observed that Vazquez had no work to do. Rivera made the same observation about one other employee. In consequence, Rivera told the municipal secretary, Dora Martinez Torres (\"Martinez\"),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> to \"`watch out,' because since she belongs to another party, and was not giving them any work it could be understood that it was political persecution.\" Rivera said that Martinez was a member of the PDP and that she began work after the new administration took office. Additionally, she explained that while at first she did not have an adverse relationship with Martinez, their working relationship later soured because of Martinez's \"persecution with the employees.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Rivera, she used to have lunch with Martinez and Delgado, but \"upon seeing that they thought differently than the way I thought, well, then I understood that it was best not to have lunch to avoid taking any decisions, well, leave my job, be a part of a persecution, and remarks that might be out of order.\" When pressed as to what <i>Delgado</i> specifically said that convinced Rivera that they should no longer lunch together, Rivera said that \"[o]ne of Mrs. Delgado's remarks had to do with the process when letters were to be delivered that there would be equality &#8212; let's say that the salaries were going to be lowered or if their permanency was going to be removed, well, then it would be the same for everyone notwithstanding the person involved.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Later, Rivera testified that she and Delgado had lunch together perhaps two or three times and that they did not talk about politics.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera was asked whether she \"could tell the jury if the members of the New Progressive Party employees were targeted for this personnel action\" of receiving the reassignment letters. Rivera replied: \"Yes, because the employees who were given permanence in '97, well, those were the employees who would be subjected to the application of the law in which their permanence would be taken away from them.\" Upon prompting, Rivera said that those employees belonged to the NPP party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">d. <i>Vazquez</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vazquez was on the stand for three days. In addition to detailing her work history and the responsibilities of her employment with the municipality, Vazquez testified that her academic preparation and experiences qualified her for all of the municipal positions that she had held. Vazquez also testified that her immediate supervisor, Martinez, both made politically discriminatory remarks, including stating that \"[w]ell, hopefully they will kill all the NPPers\" and failed to give her any work from January to August of 2001. On August 24, 2001, Vazquez sent a letter and an accompanying table to Martinez detailing her work assignments since January 15, 2001 (excluding one month of vacation and one month of sick leave over the seven-month period). The letter informed Martinez that of the remaining five months of that period, Vazquez performed tasks on forty-two of the 106 work days. On cross-examination, Vazquez admitted that she never informed Delgado or Santiago of her lack of work, saying that it is \"not the mechanism, and that would be gossip.\" She further admitted that after Martinez received her letter of August 24, Vazquez was given sufficient work to occupy her work days.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vazquez testified about the meeting on May 22 when between fifteen and eighteen employees were given their reassignment letters. She said that all of the employees at the meeting were members of the NPP who \"held positions of hierarchy in the previous administration.\" According to Vazquez, \"the Mayor began the meeting indicating that he was the person in power, that the Popular Democratic Party had won. That they had to adopt actions with employees, that they had to clean house and that they were going to deliver letters to us in which there would be changes in our salaries or our permanence; that whomever wished to go to JASAP had 30 days to do so, that whomever wished to go through attorneys, well, they then had to bear the consequences of their actions and that we would see each other in Court.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Vazquez continued recounting the events of the meeting, noting that Delgado \"began indicating that she was seconding what the Mayor had stated and she explained the appeals process.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vazquez also recounted the details of what appears to be the only other time she met Santiago. When Santiago was campaigning and seeking votes, he visited the community where Vazquez lived. According to Vazquez, \"[h]e came up the stairs. At that point he introduced himself as a candidate for the Popular Democratic Party and at that point I told him that I belonged to the New Progressive Party, that I campaigned for the NPP from 1984. That I was a militant and that I had held assorted positions with the administration of Mayor Victor Soto and as all candidates he told me that he was counting on my vote.\" Plaintiff's counsel then asked Vazquez whether Santiago \"was able to recognize you that you were a member of the New Progressive Party\" at the May 22 meeting. Vazquez responded, \"He shook hands with me and greeted me.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vazquez also testified about her activity on behalf of the NPP. She had been an electoral college officer since the age of eighteen and president of the committee for her local ward in Toa Baja. Vazquez participated in mobilization, fundraising, organizing, and \"all kinds of activities related to politics and the NPP.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">2. <i>Defendants' Uncontradicted Testimony</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before considering this testimony, we observe that a strong case could be made that defendants' motion for judgment as a matter of law at the close of plaintiff's case should have been granted. Of course, defendants do not make this argument on appeal. Having put on a defense at trial, they are foreclosed from doing so. <i>See Gillentine v. McKeand,</i> 426 F.2d 717, 723 (1st Cir.1970) (\"defendant's motion for a directed verdict at the close of plaintiff's case expired\" upon the introduction of substantial defense evidence and was not preserved for appeal). Accordingly, in evaluating defendants' appeal from the district court's denial of their motion for judgment as a matter of law after the close of all evidence, we consider both plaintiff's evidence and the uncontroverted evidence offered by defendants. <i>Santiago-Negron,</i> 865 F.2d at 445.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">a. <i>Delgado</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Delgado testified that at the time of transition between the two administrations, the municipality had 1,343 employees on its roster. Delgado's uncontradicted testimony also established that there was no evidence in Vazquez's personnel file establishing that Vazquez met the minimum requirements for appointment to Secretary III or Assistant Director, or that she served the requisite probationary period for either position.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> Delgado testified that according to the documents in Vazquez's personnel file, Vazquez lacked the commercial or secretarial training required to be appointed to Secretary III in 1993. On cross, plaintiff's counsel drew Delgado's attention to Cordova's letter asking that Vazquez be appointed to Secretary III, which, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, could establish her eligibility for the position. Upon questioning, Delgado testified that she cannot explain why that document was not contained in Vazquez's personnel file.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Delgado further testified that Vazquez's personnel file contained no indication that the Human Resources Department followed the procedures and analysis required to reclassify an employee, without competition for the position, based on the employee's assumption of greater responsibility and obtaining further credentials.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">b. <i>Santiago</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In uncontradicted testimony from Santiago, he explained that he sought advice regarding the effect and legality of the 1997 plan, and that he acted on that advice. As noted, the evidentiary rulings below prevented the defense from putting before the jury the nature of the advice the defendants received.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago further testified that of the municipal employees who received letters adjusting their status, \"nearly half of them, their salaries have increased, others have gone down.\" He also testified that he retained several members of the opposing party in trust positions after he took office and that he took only one of his people into the mayor's office with him. According to Santiago, \"the rest of them, I honored their position and I allowed them to remain, despite the fact that it's a high confidentiality position....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago was asked on cross-examination whether he knew the party of the employees who lost permanent status and became transitory employees by virtue of declaring the 1997 plan void. He replied that \"[t]here are members of all three parties.\" When pressed for an estimated percentage break-down among the parties, Santiago could not provide one, but he agreed that there were more NPP members than PDP members in that group. When counsel asked whether it is \"a true fact that, more or less, from 75 to 80 percent of the employees of Tao Baja are members of the New Progressive Party,\" Santiago agreed that \"[t]hat might be.\" According to Santiago's uncontradicted testimony, he had not appointed anyone to a career position since he took office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. <i>Topical Summary of the Evidence</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On topics important to establishing a political discrimination claim, the evidence that we have reviewed through the Rule 50 lens establishes the following propositions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">1. <i>Personnel Actions</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants rescinded the 1997 plan and reassigned several hundred employees, including Vazquez, in accordance with the 1991 plan. Sanchez testified that she advised Santiago to seek advice before deciding to rescind the 1997 plan. Santiago's uncontradicted testimony was that he did indeed seek such advice. As we have described, the nature of that advice was kept from the jury at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sanchez testified that the people whom she knew who were affected by the reclassification plan were NPP members. Rivera also testified that affected employees belonged to the NPP. However, the kind of personnel review undertaken by defendants necessarily would impact more NPP members because of the long dominance of the NPP over municipal affairs. Indeed, Santiago agreed with plaintiff's counsel that approximately seventy-five to eighty percent of the employees of Toa Baja are members of the NPP, and Rivera herself explained, \"because the employees who were given permanence in '97 [when the NPP had been in control of the city government for over twenty years], well, those were the employees who would be subjected to the application of the law in which their permanence would be taken away from them.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago's uncontradicted testimony was that nearly half of the employees affected by the personnel changes actually received higher salaries. Plaintiff neither rebutted this testimony nor offered any evidence that there was a disparity &#8212; by political affiliation or otherwise &#8212; between those who received higher salaries and those who received lower salaries under the new reclassifications.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">2. <i>Treatment of Vazquez</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vazquez lacked sufficient work to occupy her time from January through August 2001 (less the two months when she was on leave). When Vazquez sent a letter to her immediate supervisor, Martinez, detailing her lack of work projects during this time, Martinez began assigning Vazquez adequate work. Additionally, Vazquez was demoted from Executive Director II to Office Worker/Typist I effective February 1, 2002. A hearing officer found that the reassignment was valid because Vazquez previously had been illegally hired and promoted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sanchez and Cordova testified that Vazquez met the minimum qualifications for each of the positions to which she had been appointed. However, Sanchez admitted that the municipality generally did not follow the procedural requirements for personnel actions. Plaintiff never offered any clear evidence or testimony that her appointments either met these procedural requirements or were eligible for an exception to any of the requirements. In fact, Vazquez admitted that she was promoted without going through the regular competitive process or serving the normally required probationary period. Furthermore, Delgado's uncontradicted testimony was that there was no material in Vazquez's personnel file to show either that the procedural requirements were followed or that Vazquez's appointments were eligible for an exception to the usual procedural requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, Vazquez arguably established that she did not need to comply with the normal appointment procedures when she assumed the position of Executive Director II because that position was simply a reclassification of the position of Assistant Director. However, Vazquez's demotion to Office Worker/Typist I was premised on the alleged illegality of her appointment to Secretary III, not on any ineligibility to be reassigned from Assistant Director to Executive Director II.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">3. <i>Statements of Discriminatory Intent</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the May 22 meeting, where fifteen to eighteen NPP employees received letters adjusting their positions within the municipality, the Mayor stated that the \"Popular Democratic Party had won. That they had to adopt actions with employees, that they had to clean house and that they were going to deliver letters to us in which there would be changes in our salaries or our permanence....\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> Plaintiff presented evidence of one other statement evincing discriminatory intent or animus: Martinez, plaintiff's direct supervisor and a non-party in this case, said at a gathering something like \"[w]ell, hopefully they will kill all the NPPers.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">4. <i>Rivera's Perception of Political Retaliation</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera, a member of the PDP, offered what is best characterized as lay opinion testimony: she thought political retaliation was occurring in her department under Martinez, based on her observation that Vazquez and one other employee were not fully occupied with work, at least for some period of time. Rivera testified that \"if I saw anything or understood that there would be any persecution, that I would rather resign and that is what I did.\" Additionally, Rivera said at one point that after having lunch with Delgado and Martinez, she saw \"that they thought differently than the way I thought.\" There is also an ambiguous reference to \"remarks that might be out of order\" in Rivera's testimony. Rivera also testified that her relationship with Martinez soured over Rivera's perception of political persecution in the workplace.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, Rivera also testified that she and Delgado did not talk about politics, and that the only political comment Delgado made to her was one that \"had to do with the process when letters were to be delivered that there would be equality &#8212; let's say that the salaries were going to be lowered or if their permanency was going to be removed, well, then it would be the same for everyone notwithstanding the person [or regardless of the pressure] involved.\" This testimony by plaintiff's own witness establishes that Delgado indicated that the reclassifications would be done with \"equality\" and that changes in permanence or salaries would be implemented regardless of the people affected (or the pressure involved). This testimony &#8212; elicited by plaintiff's counsel during her case-in-chief &#8212; supports defendants' claims that they implemented the reclassifications in a neutral manner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. <i>Analysis of the Evidence</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This evidence is not sufficient to show that plaintiff's political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor in defendants' decision to reclassify her under the 1991 plan. In fact, the evidence presented at trial does not create a reasonable inference that defendants were even <i>aware</i> of Vazquez's political affiliation at the time her personnel file was reviewed and she was reassigned according to the 1991 plan. We encountered a factually similar situation in <i>Gonzalez-De-Blasini v. Family Dept.,</i> 377 F.3d 81 (1st Cir.2004). There, we affirmed dismissal of a plaintiff's political discrimination claim because plaintiff</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">adduced no evidence that the defendants knew she was a member of the NPP. She attempts to bolster her political discrimination cause of action by alleging that [defendants] must have been aware of her political affiliation because she was a well-known supporter of the NPP in the community, had held a previous trust position under the NPP administration, and was allegedly demoted shortly after the PDP assumed power. [Plaintiff] points to [defendant's] statement that she wanted [plaintiff's] office and position to go to an employee of her trust as indication of a causal link between her political beliefs and the change in her employment conditions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 85-86. In <i>Gonzalez-De-Blasini,</i> we held that such evidence was \"insufficient to show that political affiliation was a substantial factor in the challenged employment action.\" <i>Id.</i> at 86.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vazquez has shown no more here. The fact that Santiago met Vazquez during routine campaign canvassing, and that Vazquez then identified herself as a member of the NPP and an employee of Mayor Soto's, does not lead to a reasonable inference that Santiago or Delgado knew that she was a member of the NPP when they conducted their review of all personnel files for irregularities or when they met with her on May 22 as part of a group. Nor does Vazquez's testimony about her NPP activities or positions held under the previous administration support such an inference. Toa Baja is a city with almost 100,000 residents, and the city employed approximately 1,300 people. While Vazquez did occupy a trust position for about twenty months under Mayor Soto, she provided no evidence that her trust position was of such a high nature that defendants necessarily would have known who she was and her party affiliation. In fact, when asked on direct examination whether Santiago recognized her as an NPP member at the May 22 meeting, five or six months after Santiago introduced himself while campaigning, Vazquez did not answer in the affirmative. Instead, she stated only that \"[h]e shook hands with me and greeted me.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if a jury could reasonably infer that defendants knew that plaintiff was a member of the NPP, that still is insufficient. Proving that her political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse decision requires more than \"[m]erely juxtaposing a protected characteristic &#8212; someone else's politics &#8212; with the fact that the plaintiff was treated unfairly.\" <i>Correa-Martinez v. Arrillaga-Belendez,</i> 903 F.2d 49, 58 (1st Cir.1990). Indeed, the evidence falls short of even showing that Vazquez was treated \"unfairly.\" Regardless of whether she met the minimum educational and experiential qualifications, a disputed point on which we take Vazquez's version of events, the undisputed testimony establishes that Vazquez did not meet the statutory procedural requirements &#8212; such as applying for and being interviewed for an advertised job in competition with other candidates, or serving the required probationary period &#8212; for the Secretary III and Assistant Director appointments. Plaintiff's own witness, Sanchez, testified that the municipality simply did not hire personnel in accordance with these various provisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The mayor's alleged comment about \"cleaning house\" also is not sufficient to sustain plaintiff's burden. In <i>Figueroa-Serrano,</i> a plaintiff testified that the mayor said that \"he was going to clean City Hall of most NPP employees....\" <i>Figueroa-Serrano,</i> 221 F.3d at 4.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> In granting defendants' summary judgment motion, we observed that the plaintiffs relied on \"generalized assertions of the defendants' affiliation with the rival political party\" and the enactment of a personnel policy change after the elections. <i>Id.</i> at 8. \"The only specific evidence that they offer is the sworn statement of a single plaintiff that [the mayor] voiced his intention to rid City Hall of NPP employees. They have failed to provide names or other specific factual information supporting their claim that the Municipality replaced them with new hires from the PDP.\" <i>Id.</i> We then characterized this evidence as a \"meager showing\" and held that it was \"patently insufficient to generate a genuine issue of material fact on a causal connection between the political affiliation of the plaintiffs and the adverse employment actions alleged.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff has done no better here. Indeed, Vazquez's testimony regarding Santiago's \"cleaning house\" comment is even less forceful than the plaintiff's testimony in <i>Figueroa-Serrano.</i> There, the mayor allegedly said specifically that he intended to get rid of NPP members. Here, Vazquez did not even allege that kind of direct statement from Santiago. In contrast to Vazquez's case, we have upheld a district court's denial of motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict when the plaintiffs presented \"ample evidence that [the defendant mayor] (1) knew plaintiffs were affiliated with NPP, (2) vowed to rid the [municipal] government of NPP members, (3) gave instructions to `chop off the heads of the NPP members,' and (4) told municipal employees to switch to the PDP.\" <i>Hiraldo-Cancel v. Aponte,</i> 925 F.2d 10, 12 (1st Cir.1991). Vazquez has produced no comparable evidence here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Importantly, Vazquez also offered no evidence that PDP members were hired to replace the reassigned NPP members. In fact, Santiago's uncontradicted testimony was that he had not appointed anyone to a career position since he took office. Vazquez also offered no evidence that the reassignments were effectuated in a discriminatory or differential manner, or that they were targeted at NPP employees. Plaintiff's own witness, Rivera, stated that Delgado told her that if the result of reassigning people according to the 1991 plan was that it would be done with \"equality\" and if \"the salaries were going to be lowered or if their permanency was going to be removed, well, then it would be the same for everyone notwithstanding the person [or regardless of the pressure] involved.\" The defendants presented uncontradicted testimony that they were reviewing every personnel file in the municipality and that members of all parties were affected by the reassignments. These facts distinguish this case from the scenario presented in <i>Acevedo-Garcia v. Monroig,</i> 351 F.3d 547 (1st Cir.2003). There, \"[p]laintiffs... produced evidence supporting their theory that the termination plan was implemented in a way designed to target members of the NPP while sparing most members of the PDP. Further, the jury heard evidence that the vast majority of people hired with extra-municipal funds belonged to the PDP.\" <i>Id.</i> at 565-66. Vazquez has made no such showing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At first blush, the actions and statements by Martinez, Vazquez's supervisor, are troublesome. Martinez failed to provide adequate work to keep Vazquez occupied for five months, and Martinez also allegedly stated that \"[w]ell, hopefully they will kill all the NPPers.\" However, Vazquez makes no showing as to why defendants should be held liable for Martinez's actions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> Vazquez admitted that she informed neither Delgado nor Santiago about her lack of work, and she admitted that Martinez gave her sufficient work after Vazquez's memo of August 24, 2001. Vazquez offered no evidence that Martinez's actions reflected a municipal \"custom or practice [that] is so well settled and widespread that the policy-making officials of the municipality can be said to have either actual or constructive knowledge of it yet did nothing to end the practice.\" <i>Silva v. Worden,</i> 130 F.3d 26, 31 (1st Cir.1997) (quotations and citations omitted) (cited in <i>Acevedo-Garcia v. Monroig,</i> 30 F.Supp.2d 141, 152 (D.P.R.1998)). Unlike in <i>Acevedo-Garcia,</i> where discriminating supervisors \"claimed to be acting on the orders of `higher up' officials within the Municipality, including [the defendants],\" <i>id.,</i> Vazquez has produced no such evidence here. Furthermore, Martinez's alleged comment is akin to the kind of isolated stray remark by a nondecisionmaker that we have held has limited probative value in other contexts. <i>See, e.g., Gonzalez</i> <i>v. El Dia, Inc.,</i> 304 F.3d 63 (1st Cir.2002) (explaining that in the context of an age discrimination claim, \"`stray workplace remarks,' as well as statements made either by nondecisionmakers or by decisionmakers not involved in the decisional process, normally are insufficient, standing alone, to establish either pretext or the requisite discriminatory animus\"). While Martinez was the decisionmaker regarding Vazquez's workload, plaintiff offered no testimony that Martinez was involved in any way in the decision to rescind the 1997 plan as null and void or in the review of Vazquez's personnel file and reassignment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff presented no evidence that Santiago or Delgado created an atmosphere of discrimination or a policy of leaving NPP employees without work, and she made no claim that Martinez was implementing any such policy during the months that Vazquez had insufficient work. In fact, plaintiff's witness Rivera testified that the fourteen NPP employees she supervised were always provided with adequate work. In sum, whatever problems Vazquez may have had with her immediate supervisor, Vazquez presented no evidence that any comment or action by Martinez is fairly attributable to the defendants in this case, and, on these facts, Martinez's statement is not probative of whether defendants acted with discriminatory animus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, plaintiff failed to show that her political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor in her demotion or alleged constructive discharge. Although plaintiff's allegations of \"political discrimination can be built on circumstantial evidence of constitutionally suspect motivations\" for the adverse employment action, Vazquez has offered only a mere scintilla of evidence of political discrimination. Her evidence does not amount to \"the specific facts necessary to take the asserted claim out of the realm of speculative, general allegations.\" <i>Kauffman v. P.R. Tel. Co.,</i> 841 F.2d 1169, 1173 n. 5 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not set aside jury verdicts lightly. Nevertheless, when plaintiff fails to adduce sufficient evidence for a jury to reasonably infer that plaintiff's political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor in an adverse employment action, we must do so. For the forgoing reasons, we vacate the judgment and order the entry of judgment for defendants. The parties shall bear their own costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The contents of these documents were not admitted below, over defendants' strenuous objections. The district court found that these documents were inadmissible as hearsay and informed the jury only that defendants sought advice about personnel actions and other issues, and that they received such advice from these agencies. The exclusion of these documents as hearsay is troubling. So crucial to the defendants' case, and offered as an explanation for the personnel actions undertaken by the defendants rather than for the truth of the personnel irregularities described in the documents, these documents are not hearsay, and they were highly relevant. Their exclusion might well have justified a new trial. However, we do not have to decide that issue because of our disposition of the case on sufficiency of the evidence grounds. Because defendants made an offer of proof regarding these documents at trial, we may consider the excluded documents as part of the record on appeal for the purpose of describing the background of this case<i>United States v. McDaniel,</i> 482 F.2d 305, 311 (8th Cir.1973); <i>see also</i> Wright and Graham, Federal Practice and Procedure: Evidence &#167; 5040 (1977) (\"Documents and other exhibits are usually marked for identification and become part of the record on appeal, even if excluded.\").

Following the jury verdict awarding compensatory and punitive damages to V&#225;zquez, defendants seek the entry of judgment on their behalf as a matter of law or, in the alternative, a new trial. In arguing for judgment as a matter of law, defendants aver that plaintiff did not introduce sufficient evidence for a jury to reasonably infer that defendants discriminated against V&#225;zquez on the basis of her political affiliation. Such an argument rarely prevails after a favorable jury verdict. However, having reviewed the record with care, we agree that it prevails here.

In the municipality of Toa Baja, defendant Victor J. Santiago, the PDP candidate for mayor of Toa Baja, defeated the incumbent NPP candidate, Victor Soto, who had been mayor for sixteen years. In total, the NPP had controlled the municipal government of Toa Baja for twenty-four years prior to the 2000 election.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon taking office, the new administration apparently faced several challenges. Among them were issues related to personnel actions and human resources plans that were detailed in several documents, including an audit from the Comptroller of Puerto Rico, dated June 14, 2000; a letter from the Commonwealth's Central Office for the Administration of Personnel and Human Resources (known by its acronym \"OCALARH,\" which is based on the Spanish version of the office's name); and another letter from the Office of the Commissioner for Municipal Affairs (similarly known as \"OCAP\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> These documents addressed personnel issues of the municipality. In Puerto Rico, all municipal jobs are governed by so-called job classification plans that are adopted locally. These plans set forth the occupational groups and personnel structure of the municipality, including the primary responsibilities and employment requirements for each position in city government. The salaries for various jobs are set forth in a separate salary scale that establishes the salary for each job by classification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From time to time, municipalities revise their job classification plans. Toa Baja undertook this task in 1997, when it altered the then-existing job classification plan that had been adopted in 1991.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> According to the Comptroller's report, the 1997 changes were not valid alterations to the 1991 plan because they were not first submitted for approval to OCALARH, and past municipal administrations had appointed several hundred employees in violation of the relevant state law and regulations. The report also recommended both that the municipality put in place a system for the selection and recruitment of personnel and that the administration develop a corrective action plan to remedy the various illegalities cited therein.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants then undertook a review of the personnel files of all 1,300 or so municipal employees. Defendants claim that they did so because, according to the Comptroller's report, \"[n]ot addressing the recommendations of the audit ... without just cause[ ] may constitute a violation [of] ... the Government Ethics Act.\" Plaintiff maintains that the defendants sought to retaliate against members of the NPP. As of May 2002, at the time of the trial, around six hundred files had been evaluated, including V&#225;zquez's. Of those, 281 employees had sought an informal hearing regarding the personnel action that resulted from the review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>V&#225;zquez's Political Activity and Employment History</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">V&#225;zquez has been active in the NPP since the age of eighteen.

Additionally, she was one of the NPP's electoral college officers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Her employment at the municipality of Toa Baja started in 1985, when V&#225;zquez was employed in a transitory position<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> as an office clerk. On February 1, 1989, she became a career employee in the position of Office Worker/Typist I at a monthly salary of $545. On July 1, 1993, V&#225;zquez was appointed to the position of Secretary III, with a monthly salary of $1019, at the request of David C&#243;rdova Torrech (\"C&#243;rdova\"), her immediate supervisor and head of the Office of Services to the Citizenry. Twenty days later, C&#243;rdova asked that V&#225;zquez be reassigned again, this time to the position of Assistant Director of the newly created Levittown branch of the Office of Services to the Citizenry. That request was granted, and V&#225;zquez assumed the position of Assistant Director on August 16, with a monthly salary of $1752.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1997, the alteration to the job classification plan eliminated the position of Assistant Director from the employment hierarchy. In the wake of that elimination, V&#225;zquez was reassigned to the position of Executive Director II. Two years later, in 1999, V&#225;zquez was appointed as an Administrative Assistant to Mayor Soto, a trust position within the administration. Following NPP's defeat at the polls in 2000, V&#225;zquez was reassigned to her former position of Executive Director II.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>V&#225;zquez's Demotion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 22, 2001, the defendants, Mayor Santiago and Director of Human Resources Delgado, held a meeting with fifteen to eighteen employees, including V&#225;zquez, to notify them that their classifications were being changed pursuant to the decision to declare the 1997 plan null and void and return to the 1991 classifications. According to V&#225;zquez, Santiago explained at that meeting that the PDP had won the election and, in V&#225;zquez's words, said that \"they had to adopt actions with employees, that they had to clean house....\" Santiago then explained that the affected employees had certain rights to administrative hearings and, again in V&#225;zquez's words, \"that whomever wished to go through attorneys, well, they then had to bear the consequences of their actions and that we would see each other in Court.\" V&#225;zquez testified that Delgado then took the floor, saying that she agreed with Santiago; Delgado then explained the appeals process to the reclassified employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following Delgado's explanation of the appeals process, the employees were handed letters describing their new classifications and explaining the reasons for the reclassifications. The letter to V&#225;zquez stated that she lacked the academic preparation or experience for her current position and was being reassigned to Office Worker/Typist I, the position she held in 1989. According to the defendants' review of her personnel file, that was the last position to which V&#225;zquez had validly been appointed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">V&#225;zquez attended a hearing in front of an administrative hearing officer on September 9, 2001.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> According to V&#225;zquez, the hearing lasted approximately five minutes. In January 2002, the hearing officer issued a report and recommendation to the effect that V&#225;zquez had been illegally hired and promoted. Although V&#225;zquez remained in the Executive Director II position at the monthly salary of $2083 pending the outcome of the hearing, she was officially reassigned to Office Worker/Typist I by letter of January 30, 2002. Her monthly salary was reduced accordingly to $900, effective February 1. On March 15, 2002, V&#225;zquez tendered her resignation to Santiago, effective April 9.

V&#225;zquez sued Santiago and Delgado in both their official and personal capacities. V&#225;zquez alleged that she was demoted and constructively discharged, and that these adverse employment actions violated her First Amendment and due process rights under the United States Constitution. In her complaint, she sought compensatory and punitive damages, as well as reinstatement. The defendants denied the allegations and replied that V&#225;zquez was illegally appointed to her position with the city and that they were obligated to correct the irregularity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 27, 2002, prior to trial, the defendants moved for summary judgment, with Santiago and Delgado raising the affirmative defense of qualified immunity in their individual capacities. The district court denied the motion. A jury trial began on April 30, 2002. At the close of all evidence, defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50, arguing that V&#225;zquez did not produce sufficient evidence to show (1) that her due process rights were violated, (2) that her political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor for her demotion, or (3) that she was constructively discharged. The district court granted defendants' Rule 50 motion as to the due process claim but denied it in all other respects, including the qualified immunity defense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 14, the jury found for plaintiff, awarding her $275,000 in compensatory damages for mental and emotional pain and suffering, $6,828 in compensatory damages for lost earnings, and $42,000 in punitive damages, for a total of $323,828, plus post-judgment interest, reasonable costs, and attorney's fees.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> In light of the jury finding that the defendants discriminated against V&#225;zquez on the basis of her political affiliation and the jury's award of punitive damages, the district court rejected Santiago's and Delgado's affirmative defense of qualified immunity. The district court then denied defendants' post-trial Rule 59 motion, which asked the court to set aside the compensatory and punitive damages as excessive and without a sound evidentiary basis. The district court also ordered the defendants to reinstate V&#225;zquez to her previous position of Executive Director II.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants raise several arguments on appeal. First, they urge that the district court erred in denying their Rule 50 motion as to the political discrimination claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Second, defendants argue that the district court erred in denying admissibility of the Comptroller's report and agency letters, which defendants maintain were crucial to substantiating that political discrimination was not a factor in V&#225;zquez's reassignment. Third, defendants claim that the trial court made allegedly prejudicial remarks in front of the jury. Fourth, defendants assert that the district court erred in ordering plaintiff reinstated to her previous position of Executive Director II. Finally, in their individual capacity, defendants challenge the district court's denial of the qualified immunity defense.

In other words, even if the plaintiff has shown that her political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment decision, the defendant will not be held liable if it can persuade the factfinder that it would have taken the same course of action anyway, without regard to plaintiff's political affiliation. The Supreme Court has made clear that defendant's <i>Mt.

However, if a plaintiff does not produce evidence sufficient to allow a reasonable inference that political discrimination was a substantial or motivating factor in the challenged employment action, we need not analyze defendant's <i>Mt.

Rivera Vega (\"Rivera\"), who was purchasing and procurement bids director for the municipality during six months relevant to this litigation; and (4) Vazquez herself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">a. <i>Sanchez</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sanchez testified that when she became aware that Santiago was considering rescinding the 1997 plan and restoring staffing in accordance with the 1991 plan, she told him \"that I did not believe that he should take upon himself to do the action that he intended to do ... since there were explanations for everything that had taken place and that could entail certain employees might sue him and that he might have to appear in court.\" According to Sanchez, Santiago replied that \"if he had to go to court and the court assigned him to pay, that he would pay.\" Sanchez further testified that she advised him that \"the 1997 plan had been approved by a municipality ordinance and that he should seek guidance in that sense.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In answer to questions about how many employees were switched from career employee status to transitory employee status as a result of the Mayor's decision to rescind the 1997 plan, Sanchez could not give a numerical estimate. Instead, she mentioned some names of affected people whom she personally knew. After listing five people by name and saying that she \"would have to mention a whole bunch of them because there were many,\" Sanchez testified that \"all these people\" belonged to the NPP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff also elicited testimony from Sanchez regarding Vazquez's qualifications for the positions to which she had been appointed. In sum, Sanchez testified that Vazquez was qualified for all the positions she had held at the municipality. However, Sanchez admitted on cross-examination that Commonwealth law requires, with some exceptions, that before a position is filled it must be posted or advertised; that the vacancy must be filled using a system called the \"register of eligible\" or some alternative equivalent system; that the hired personnel must serve a probationary period of three to six months; and that an employee may only become a career employee after satisfactorily completing the probationary period. Sanchez also testified on cross that the municipality had not followed these hiring procedures as a general matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">b. <i>Cordova</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cordova, director of the Citizen's Office for the Mayor and Vazquez's direct supervisor, testified to Vazquez's increasing responsibilities and growth as an employee during her tenure with him. During Vazquez's thirteen years under Cordova, he made two written evaluations of her job performance. Additionally, Cordova explained that he petitioned the former mayor to appoint Vazquez as Assistant Director of a branch of the Citizen's Office. For purposes of our appellate review, we will assume that Cordova's testimony regarding Vazquez's job responsibilities established that she met the minimum stated requirements for the positions of Secretary III and Assistant Director (a position that was essentially renamed Executive Director II in 1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">c. <i>Rivera</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera, a member of the PDP, testified that she told Delgado \"that I am a person who under no circumstances will persecute anyone because as she [Delgado] knows, I have been persecuted for more than seventeen years by the NPPers and the Populares [PDP party members] who have allowed that I be persecuted and that I would under no circumstances would [sic] allow that and if I saw anything or understood that there would be any persecution, that I would rather resign and that is what I did.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera also testified about her understanding and observations of political persecution during her time at the municipality. She explained her \"understanding that persecution involves leaving an employee without work,\" and when Rivera passed Vazquez's desk, she often observed that Vazquez had no work to do. Rivera made the same observation about one other employee. In consequence, Rivera told the municipal secretary, Dora Martinez Torres (\"Martinez\"),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> to \"`watch out,' because since she belongs to another party, and was not giving them any work it could be understood that it was political persecution.\" Rivera said that Martinez was a member of the PDP and that she began work after the new administration took office. Additionally, she explained that while at first she did not have an adverse relationship with Martinez, their working relationship later soured because of Martinez's \"persecution with the employees.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Rivera, she used to have lunch with Martinez and Delgado, but \"upon seeing that they thought differently than the way I thought, well, then I understood that it was best not to have lunch to avoid taking any decisions, well, leave my job, be a part of a persecution, and remarks that might be out of order.\" When pressed as to what <i>Delgado</i> specifically said that convinced Rivera that they should no longer lunch together, Rivera said that \"[o]ne of Mrs. Delgado's remarks had to do with the process when letters were to be delivered that there would be equality &#8212; let's say that the salaries were going to be lowered or if their permanency was going to be removed, well, then it would be the same for everyone notwithstanding the person involved.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Later, Rivera testified that she and Delgado had lunch together perhaps two or three times and that they did not talk about politics.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera was asked whether she \"could tell the jury if the members of the New Progressive Party employees were targeted for this personnel action\" of receiving the reassignment letters. Rivera replied: \"Yes, because the employees who were given permanence in '97, well, those were the employees who would be subjected to the application of the law in which their permanence would be taken away from them.\" Upon prompting, Rivera said that those employees belonged to the NPP party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">d. <i>Vazquez</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vazquez was on the stand for three days. In addition to detailing her work history and the responsibilities of her employment with the municipality, Vazquez testified that her academic preparation and experiences qualified her for all of the municipal positions that she had held. Vazquez also testified that her immediate supervisor, Martinez, both made politically discriminatory remarks, including stating that \"[w]ell, hopefully they will kill all the NPPers\" and failed to give her any work from January to August of 2001. On August 24, 2001, Vazquez sent a letter and an accompanying table to Martinez detailing her work assignments since January 15, 2001 (excluding one month of vacation and one month of sick leave over the seven-month period). The letter informed Martinez that of the remaining five months of that period, Vazquez performed tasks on forty-two of the 106 work days. On cross-examination, Vazquez admitted that she never informed Delgado or Santiago of her lack of work, saying that it is \"not the mechanism, and that would be gossip.\" She further admitted that after Martinez received her letter of August 24, Vazquez was given sufficient work to occupy her work days.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vazquez testified about the meeting on May 22 when between fifteen and eighteen employees were given their reassignment letters. She said that all of the employees at the meeting were members of the NPP who \"held positions of hierarchy in the previous administration.\" According to Vazquez, \"the Mayor began the meeting indicating that he was the person in power, that the Popular Democratic Party had won. That they had to adopt actions with employees, that they had to clean house and that they were going to deliver letters to us in which there would be changes in our salaries or our permanence; that whomever wished to go to JASAP had 30 days to do so, that whomever wished to go through attorneys, well, they then had to bear the consequences of their actions and that we would see each other in Court.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Vazquez continued recounting the events of the meeting, noting that Delgado \"began indicating that she was seconding what the Mayor had stated and she explained the appeals process.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vazquez also recounted the details of what appears to be the only other time she met Santiago. When Santiago was campaigning and seeking votes, he visited the community where Vazquez lived. According to Vazquez, \"[h]e came up the stairs. At that point he introduced himself as a candidate for the Popular Democratic Party and at that point I told him that I belonged to the New Progressive Party, that I campaigned for the NPP from 1984. That I was a militant and that I had held assorted positions with the administration of Mayor Victor Soto and as all candidates he told me that he was counting on my vote.\" Plaintiff's counsel then asked Vazquez whether Santiago \"was able to recognize you that you were a member of the New Progressive Party\" at the May 22 meeting. Vazquez responded, \"He shook hands with me and greeted me.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vazquez also testified about her activity on behalf of the NPP. She had been an electoral college officer since the age of eighteen and president of the committee for her local ward in Toa Baja. Vazquez participated in mobilization, fundraising, organizing, and \"all kinds of activities related to politics and the NPP.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">2. <i>Defendants' Uncontradicted Testimony</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before considering this testimony, we observe that a strong case could be made that defendants' motion for judgment as a matter of law at the close of plaintiff's case should have been granted. Of course, defendants do not make this argument on appeal. Having put on a defense at trial, they are foreclosed from doing so. <i>See Gillentine v. McKeand,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"290229\"><a href=\"/opinion/290229/virginia-t-gillentine-v-maxwell-n-mckeand-lawrence-moore/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">717</span></a></span>, 723 (1st Cir.1970) (\"defendant's motion for a directed verdict at the close of plaintiff's case expired\" upon the introduction of substantial defense evidence and was not preserved for appeal). Accordingly, in evaluating defendants' appeal from the district court's denial of their motion for judgment as a matter of law after the close of all evidence, we consider both plaintiff's evidence and the uncontroverted evidence offered by defendants. <i>Santiago-Negron,</i> 865 F.2d at 445.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">a. <i>Delgado</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Delgado testified that at the time of transition between the two administrations, the municipality had 1,343 employees on its roster. Delgado's uncontradicted testimony also established that there was no evidence in Vazquez's personnel file establishing that Vazquez met the minimum requirements for appointment to Secretary III or Assistant Director, or that she served the requisite probationary period for either position.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> Delgado testified that according to the documents in Vazquez's personnel file, Vazquez lacked the commercial or secretarial training required to be appointed to Secretary III in 1993. On cross, plaintiff's counsel drew Delgado's attention to Cordova's letter asking that Vazquez be appointed to Secretary III, which, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, could establish her eligibility for the position. Upon questioning, Delgado testified that she cannot explain why that document was not contained in Vazquez's personnel file.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Delgado further testified that Vazquez's personnel file contained no indication that the Human Resources Department followed the procedures and analysis required to reclassify an employee, without competition for the position, based on the employee's assumption of greater responsibility and obtaining further credentials.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">b. <i>Santiago</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In uncontradicted testimony from Santiago, he explained that he sought advice regarding the effect and legality of the 1997 plan, and that he acted on that advice. As noted, the evidentiary rulings below prevented the defense from putting before the jury the nature of the advice the defendants received.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago further testified that of the municipal employees who received letters adjusting their status, \"nearly half of them, their salaries have increased, others have gone down.\" He also testified that he retained several members of the opposing party in trust positions after he took office and that he took only one of his people into the mayor's office with him. According to Santiago, \"the rest of them, I honored their position and I allowed them to remain, despite the fact that it's a high confidentiality position....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago was asked on cross-examination whether he knew the party of the employees who lost permanent status and became transitory employees by virtue of declaring the 1997 plan void. He replied that \"[t]here are members of all three parties.\" When pressed for an estimated percentage break-down among the parties, Santiago could not provide one, but he agreed that there were more NPP members than PDP members in that group. When counsel asked whether it is \"a true fact that, more or less, from 75 to 80 percent of the employees of Tao Baja are members of the New Progressive Party,\" Santiago agreed that \"[t]hat might be.\" According to Santiago's uncontradicted testimony, he had not appointed anyone to a career position since he took office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. <i>Topical Summary of the Evidence</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On topics important to establishing a political discrimination claim, the evidence that we have reviewed through the Rule 50 lens establishes the following propositions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">1. <i>Personnel Actions</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants rescinded the 1997 plan and reassigned several hundred employees, including Vazquez, in accordance with the 1991 plan. Sanchez testified that she advised Santiago to seek advice before deciding to rescind the 1997 plan. Santiago's uncontradicted testimony was that he did indeed seek such advice. As we have described, the nature of that advice was kept from the jury at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sanchez testified that the people whom she knew who were affected by the reclassification plan were NPP members. Rivera also testified that affected employees belonged to the NPP. However, the kind of personnel review undertaken by defendants necessarily would impact more NPP members because of the long dominance of the NPP over municipal affairs. Indeed, Santiago agreed with plaintiff's counsel that approximately seventy-five to eighty percent of the employees of Toa Baja are members of the NPP, and Rivera herself explained, \"because the employees who were given permanence in '97 [when the NPP had been in control of the city government for over twenty years], well, those were the employees who would be subjected to the application of the law in which their permanence would be taken away from them.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago's uncontradicted testimony was that nearly half of the employees affected by the personnel changes actually received higher salaries. Plaintiff neither rebutted this testimony nor offered any evidence that there was a disparity &#8212; by political affiliation or otherwise &#8212; between those who received higher salaries and those who received lower salaries under the new reclassifications.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">2. <i>Treatment of Vazquez</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vazquez lacked sufficient work to occupy her time from January through August 2001 (less the two months when she was on leave). When Vazquez sent a letter to her immediate supervisor, Martinez, detailing her lack of work projects during this time, Martinez began assigning Vazquez adequate work. Additionally, Vazquez was demoted from Executive Director II to Office Worker/Typist I effective February 1, 2002. A hearing officer found that the reassignment was valid because Vazquez previously had been illegally hired and promoted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sanchez and Cordova testified that Vazquez met the minimum qualifications for each of the positions to which she had been appointed. However, Sanchez admitted that the municipality generally did not follow the procedural requirements for personnel actions. Plaintiff never offered any clear evidence or testimony that her appointments either met these procedural requirements or were eligible for an exception to any of the requirements. In fact, Vazquez admitted that she was promoted without going through the regular competitive process or serving the normally required probationary period. Furthermore, Delgado's uncontradicted testimony was that there was no material in Vazquez's personnel file to show either that the procedural requirements were followed or that Vazquez's appointments were eligible for an exception to the usual procedural requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, Vazquez arguably established that she did not need to comply with the normal appointment procedures when she assumed the position of Executive Director II because that position was simply a reclassification of the position of Assistant Director. However, Vazquez's demotion to Office Worker/Typist I was premised on the alleged illegality of her appointment to Secretary III, not on any ineligibility to be reassigned from Assistant Director to Executive Director II.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">3. <i>Statements of Discriminatory Intent</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the May 22 meeting, where fifteen to eighteen NPP employees received letters adjusting their positions within the municipality, the Mayor stated that the \"Popular Democratic Party had won. That they had to adopt actions with employees, that they had to clean house and that they were going to deliver letters to us in which there would be changes in our salaries or our permanence....\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> Plaintiff presented evidence of one other statement evincing discriminatory intent or animus: Martinez, plaintiff's direct supervisor and a non-party in this case, said at a gathering something like \"[w]ell, hopefully they will kill all the NPPers.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">4. <i>Rivera's Perception of Political Retaliation</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera, a member of the PDP, offered what is best characterized as lay opinion testimony: she thought political retaliation was occurring in her department under Martinez, based on her observation that Vazquez and one other employee were not fully occupied with work, at least for some period of time. Rivera testified that \"if I saw anything or understood that there would be any persecution, that I would rather resign and that is what I did.\" Additionally, Rivera said at one point that after having lunch with Delgado and Martinez, she saw \"that they thought differently than the way I thought.\" There is also an ambiguous reference to \"remarks that might be out of order\" in Rivera's testimony. Rivera also testified that her relationship with Martinez soured over Rivera's perception of political persecution in the workplace.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, Rivera also testified that she and Delgado did not talk about politics, and that the only political comment Delgado made to her was one that \"had to do with the process when letters were to be delivered that there would be equality &#8212; let's say that the salaries were going to be lowered or if their permanency was going to be removed, well, then it would be the same for everyone notwithstanding the person [or regardless of the pressure] involved.\" This testimony by plaintiff's own witness establishes that Delgado indicated that the reclassifications would be done with \"equality\" and that changes in permanence or salaries would be implemented regardless of the people affected (or the pressure involved). This testimony &#8212; elicited by plaintiff's counsel during her case-in-chief &#8212; supports defendants' claims that they implemented the reclassifications in a neutral manner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. <i>Analysis of the Evidence</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This evidence is not sufficient to show that plaintiff's political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor in defendants' decision to reclassify her under the 1991 plan. In fact, the evidence presented at trial does not create a reasonable inference that defendants were even <i>aware</i> of Vazquez's political affiliation at the time her personnel file was reviewed and she was reassigned according to the 1991 plan. We encountered a factually similar situation in <i>Gonzalez-De-Blasini v. Family Dept.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201167\"><a href=\"/opinion/201167/gonzalez-de-blasini-v-family-department/\"><span class=\"volume\">377</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2004). There, we affirmed dismissal of a plaintiff's political discrimination claim because plaintiff</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">adduced no evidence that the defendants knew she was a member of the NPP. She attempts to bolster her political discrimination cause of action by alleging that [defendants] must have been aware of her political affiliation because she was a well-known supporter of the NPP in the community, had held a previous trust position under the NPP administration, and was allegedly demoted shortly after the PDP assumed power. [Plaintiff] points to [defendant's] statement that she wanted [plaintiff's] office and position to go to an employee of her trust as indication of a causal link between her political beliefs and the change in her employment conditions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 85-86. In <i>Gonzalez-De-Blasini,</i> we held that such evidence was \"insufficient to show that political affiliation was a substantial factor in the challenged employment action.\" <i>Id.</i> at 86.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vazquez has shown no more here. The fact that Santiago met Vazquez during routine campaign canvassing, and that Vazquez then identified herself as a member of the NPP and an employee of Mayor Soto's, does not lead to a reasonable inference that Santiago or Delgado knew that she was a member of the NPP when they conducted their review of all personnel files for irregularities or when they met with her on May 22 as part of a group. Nor does Vazquez's testimony about her NPP activities or positions held under the previous administration support such an inference. Toa Baja is a city with almost 100,000 residents, and the city employed approximately 1,300 people. While Vazquez did occupy a trust position for about twenty months under Mayor Soto, she provided no evidence that her trust position was of such a high nature that defendants necessarily would have known who she was and her party affiliation. In fact, when asked on direct examination whether Santiago recognized her as an NPP member at the May 22 meeting, five or six months after Santiago introduced himself while campaigning, Vazquez did not answer in the affirmative. Instead, she stated only that \"[h]e shook hands with me and greeted me.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if a jury could reasonably infer that defendants knew that plaintiff was a member of the NPP, that still is insufficient. Proving that her political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse decision requires more than \"[m]erely juxtaposing a protected characteristic &#8212; someone else's politics &#8212; with the fact that the plaintiff was treated unfairly.\" <i>Correa-Martinez v. Arrillaga-Belendez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"541732\"><a href=\"/opinion/541732/jorge-correa-martinez-v-rene-arrillaga-belendez/\"><span class=\"volume\">903</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span>, 58 (1st Cir.1990). Indeed, the evidence falls short of even showing that Vazquez was treated \"unfairly.\" Regardless of whether she met the minimum educational and experiential qualifications, a disputed point on which we take Vazquez's version of events, the undisputed testimony establishes that Vazquez did not meet the statutory procedural requirements &#8212; such as applying for and being interviewed for an advertised job in competition with other candidates, or serving the required probationary period &#8212; for the Secretary III and Assistant Director appointments. Plaintiff's own witness, Sanchez, testified that the municipality simply did not hire personnel in accordance with these various provisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The mayor's alleged comment about \"cleaning house\" also is not sufficient to sustain plaintiff's burden. In <i>Figueroa-Serrano,</i> a plaintiff testified that the mayor said that \"he was going to clean City Hall of most NPP employees....\" <i>Figueroa-Serrano,</i> 221 F.3d at 4.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> In granting defendants' summary judgment motion, we observed that the plaintiffs relied on \"generalized assertions of the defendants' affiliation with the rival political party\" and the enactment of a personnel policy change after the elections. <i>Id.</i> at 8. \"The only specific evidence that they offer is the sworn statement of a single plaintiff that [the mayor] voiced his intention to rid City Hall of NPP employees. They have failed to provide names or other specific factual information supporting their claim that the Municipality replaced them with new hires from the PDP.\" <i>Id.</i> We then characterized this evidence as a \"meager showing\" and held that it was \"patently insufficient to generate a genuine issue of material fact on a causal connection between the political affiliation of the plaintiffs and the adverse employment actions alleged.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff has done no better here. Indeed, Vazquez's testimony regarding Santiago's \"cleaning house\" comment is even less forceful than the plaintiff's testimony in <i>Figueroa-Serrano.</i> There, the mayor allegedly said specifically that he intended to get rid of NPP members. Here, Vazquez did not even allege that kind of direct statement from Santiago. In contrast to Vazquez's case, we have upheld a district court's denial of motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict when the plaintiffs presented \"ample evidence that [the defendant mayor] (1) knew plaintiffs were affiliated with NPP, (2) vowed to rid the [municipal] government of NPP members, (3) gave instructions to `chop off the heads of the NPP members,' and (4) told municipal employees to switch to the PDP.\" <i>Hiraldo-Cancel v. Aponte,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555472\"><a href=\"/opinion/555472/norma-iris-hiraldo-cancel-v-jose-e-aponte-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">925</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span>, 12 (1st Cir.1991). Vazquez has produced no comparable evidence here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Importantly, Vazquez also offered no evidence that PDP members were hired to replace the reassigned NPP members. In fact, Santiago's uncontradicted testimony was that he had not appointed anyone to a career position since he took office. Vazquez also offered no evidence that the reassignments were effectuated in a discriminatory or differential manner, or that they were targeted at NPP employees. Plaintiff's own witness, Rivera, stated that Delgado told her that if the result of reassigning people according to the 1991 plan was that it would be done with \"equality\" and if \"the salaries were going to be lowered or if their permanency was going to be removed, well, then it would be the same for everyone notwithstanding the person [or regardless of the pressure] involved.\" The defendants presented uncontradicted testimony that they were reviewing every personnel file in the municipality and that members of all parties were affected by the reassignments. These facts distinguish this case from the scenario presented in <i>Acevedo-Garcia v. Monroig,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">351</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></span> (1st Cir.2003). There, \"[p]laintiffs... produced evidence supporting their theory that the termination plan was implemented in a way designed to target members of the NPP while sparing most members of the PDP. Further, the jury heard evidence that the vast majority of people hired with extra-municipal funds belonged to the PDP.\" <i>Id.</i> at 565-66. Vazquez has made no such showing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At first blush, the actions and statements by Martinez, Vazquez's supervisor, are troublesome. Martinez failed to provide adequate work to keep Vazquez occupied for five months, and Martinez also allegedly stated that \"[w]ell, hopefully they will kill all the NPPers.\" However, Vazquez makes no showing as to why defendants should be held liable for Martinez's actions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> Vazquez admitted that she informed neither Delgado nor Santiago about her lack of work, and she admitted that Martinez gave her sufficient work after Vazquez's memo of August 24, 2001. Vazquez offered no evidence that Martinez's actions reflected a municipal \"custom or practice [that] is so well settled and widespread that the policy-making officials of the municipality can be said to have either actual or constructive knowledge of it yet did nothing to end the practice.\" <i>Silva v. Worden,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197655\"><a href=\"/opinion/197655/silva-v-worden/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 31 (1st Cir.1997) (quotations and citations omitted) (cited in <i>Acevedo-Garcia v.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">141</span></a></span>, 152 (D.P.R.1998)). Unlike in <i>Acevedo-Garcia,</i> where discriminating supervisors \"claimed to be acting on the orders of `higher up' officials within the Municipality, including [the defendants],\" <i>id.,</i> Vazquez has produced no such evidence here. Furthermore, Martinez's alleged comment is akin to the kind of isolated stray remark by a nondecisionmaker that we have held has limited probative value in other contexts. <i>See, e.g., Gonzalez</i> <i>v. El Dia, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200115\"><a href=\"/opinion/200115/gonzalez-v-el-dia-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">304</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2002) (explaining that in the context of an age discrimination claim, \"`stray workplace remarks,' as well as statements made either by nondecisionmakers or by decisionmakers not involved in the decisional process, normally are insufficient, standing alone, to establish either pretext or the requisite discriminatory animus\"). While Martinez was the decisionmaker regarding Vazquez's workload, plaintiff offered no testimony that Martinez was involved in any way in the decision to rescind the 1997 plan as null and void or in the review of Vazquez's personnel file and reassignment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff presented no evidence that Santiago or Delgado created an atmosphere of discrimination or a policy of leaving NPP employees without work, and she made no claim that Martinez was implementing any such policy during the months that Vazquez had insufficient work. In fact, plaintiff's witness Rivera testified that the fourteen NPP employees she supervised were always provided with adequate work. In sum, whatever problems Vazquez may have had with her immediate supervisor, Vazquez presented no evidence that any comment or action by Martinez is fairly attributable to the defendants in this case, and, on these facts, Martinez's statement is not probative of whether defendants acted with discriminatory animus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, plaintiff failed to show that her political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor in her demotion or alleged constructive discharge. Although plaintiff's allegations of \"political discrimination can be built on circumstantial evidence of constitutionally suspect motivations\" for the adverse employment action, Vazquez has offered only a mere scintilla of evidence of political discrimination. Her evidence does not amount to \"the specific facts necessary to take the asserted claim out of the realm of speculative, general allegations.\" <i>Kauffman v. P.R. Tel.

Nevertheless, when plaintiff fails to adduce sufficient evidence for a jury to reasonably infer that plaintiff's political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor in an adverse employment action, we must do so. For the forgoing reasons, we vacate the judgment and order the entry of judgment for defendants.

So crucial to the defendants' case, and offered as an explanation for the personnel actions undertaken by the defendants rather than for the truth of the personnel irregularities described in the documents, these documents are not hearsay, and they were highly relevant. Their exclusion might well have justified a new trial. However, we do not have to decide that issue because of our disposition of the case on sufficiency of the evidence grounds.
