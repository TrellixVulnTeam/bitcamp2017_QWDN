This pathbreaking  \"perceived\n          SELYA,  Circuit Judge.\n                               \n\ndisability\" case  presents a  textbook illustration  of the  need\n\nfor,  and  the  operation of,  the  prohibition  against handicap\n\ndiscrimination contained in section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act\n\nof 1973,  29 U.S.C.    794 (1993 Supp.).   Concluding, as  we do,\n\nthat plaintiff's proof  satisfied the burdens articulated  by the\n\ndistrict court in its jury  instructions, we uphold the denial of\n\ndefendant's various  post-trial motions  and affirm the  judgment\n\nbelow.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\n\n          At  the  times   material  hereto,  defendant-appellant\n\nDepartment of Mental Health, Retardation, and Hospitals (MHRH), a\n\nsubdivision  of the Rhode  Island state government,  operated the\n\nLadd  Center  as  a residential  facility  for  retarded persons.\n\nPlaintiff-appellee Bonnie Cook worked at Ladd as an institutional\n\nattendant  for the mentally  retarded (IA-MR) from  1978 to 1980,\n\nand  again  from   1981  to  1986.    Both   times  she  departed\n\nvoluntarily,   leaving  behind  a  spotless  work  record.    The\n\ndefendant   concedes  that  Cook's   past  performance   met  its\n\nlegitimate expectations.\n\n          In 1988,  when plaintiff  reapplied  for the  identical\n\nposition,  she  stood  5'2\"  tall and  weighed  over  320 pounds.\n\nDuring the  routine pre-hire physical,  a nurse employed  by MHRH\n\nconcluded  that  plaintiff  was  morbidly  obese1  but  found  no\n\n                    \n\n     1The medical profession considers a person morbidly obese if\nshe weighs either more than twice her optimal weight or more than\n100 pounds  over her optimal weight.   See Merck Manual  950, 953\n                                                       \n\n                                2\n\nlimitations  that  impinged  upon  her ability  to  do  the  job.\n\nNotwithstanding that  plaintiff passed the  physical examination,\n\nMHRH  balked.  It claimed  that Cook's morbid obesity compromised\n\nher ability to  evacuate patients in case of an emergency and put\n\nher at greater risk of developing serious ailments (a \"fact\" that\n\nMHRH's  hierarchs  speculated   would  promote  absenteeism   and\n\nincrease  the   likelihood  of  workers'   compensation  claims).\n\nConsequently, MHRH refused  to hire plaintiff for  a vacant IA-MR\n\nposition.\n\n          Cook did not go quietly into this dark night.  Invoking\n\nsection  504, she  sued MHRH  in federal  district court.2   MHRH\n\nmoved to  dismiss the  complaint, see Fed.  R. Civ.  P. 12(b)(6),\n                                     \n\naverring  that morbid  obesity can  never  constitute a  handicap\n\nwithin the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act.  The district court\n\ndenied the motion.   See Cook v. Rhode Island, 783  F. Supp. 1569\n                                             \n\n(D.R.I. 1992).  Pretrial discovery followed.\n\n          In due  season, the parties  tried the case to  a jury.\n\nAt  the close of the evidence, appellant  moved for judgment as a\n\nmatter of law.  The court reserved decision, see Fed. R.  Civ. P.\n                                                \n\n                    \n\n(15th ed. 1987).  While Cook  had been corpulent during her prior\ntours  of  duty, she  had  not then  attained a  state  of morbid\nobesity.\n\n     2Plaintiff's  suit also  contained  counts  under the  Rhode\nIsland Fair Employment Practices Act, R.I. Gen. Laws    28-5-1 to\n28-5-40 (1992 Supp.), and under  the Rhode Island Civil Rights of\nIndividuals with Handicaps Act, R.I.  Gen. Laws    42-87-1 to 42-\n87-4 (1992 Supp.).  Since  all parties proclaim that the elements\nand standards of a handicap discrimination claim are no different\nfor present purposes  under Rhode Island law   than under federal\nlaw, we need not independently address the state-law claims.\n\n                                3\n\n50(a),  and submitted  the case  on  special interrogatories  (to\n\nwhich appellant   interposed no  objections).  The  jury answered\n\nthe interrogatories favorably  to plaintiff3 and, by means of the\n\naccompanying   general   verdict,   awarded   her   $100,000   in\n\ncompensatory damages.    The district  court  denied  appellant's\n\nmotions for judgment  as a  matter of  law and for  a new  trial,\n\nentered  judgment on the verdict, and granted equitable relief to\n\nthe plaintiff.    MHRH lost  little time  in filing  a notice  of\n\nappeal.\n\nII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n          This appeal contests  liability, not  remediation.   As\n\nformulated  by  MHRH, the  appeal  turns  on  whether  there  was\n\nsufficient evidence  to permit  a verdict  in plaintiff's  favor.\n\nThus,  appellate  review  is  plenary.    See  Rolon-Alvarado  v.\n                                                             \n\nMunicipality of San  Juan, 1 F.3d 74, 77 (1st Cir. 1993); Jordan-\n                                                                 \n\nMilton Mach., Inc. v. F/V Teresa Marie, II, 978 F.2d 32,  34 (1st\n                                          \n\nCir. 1992).   A  reviewing court applies  the same  standard that\n\ngoverned  adjudication   of  the  Rule  50  motion   below:    we\n\n\"scrutiniz[e] the proof and the inferences reasonably to be drawn\n\ntherefrom  in  the  light  most  hospitable  to  the  nonmovant,\"\n\nWagenmann v. Adams, 829 F.2d 196, 200 (1st Cir. 1987), refraining\n                  \n\nentirely from \"differential  factfinding,\" Rolon-Alvarado, 1 F.3d\n                                                         \n\nat 76.  In the process,  we may \"not consider the credibility  of\n\n                    \n\n     3The  jury found, inter alia, that plaintiff, apart from her\n                                 \nhandicap  or perceived  handicap, was  qualified  to perform  the\nduties  of the  IA-MR position;  and that  the defendant  did not\nreasonably believe plaintiff lacked such qualifications.\n\n                                4\n\nwitnesses, resolve conflicts in testimony, or evaluate the weight\n\nof the evidence.\"  Wagenmann, 829 F.2d at 200.  We can overturn a\n                            \n\njury's verdict and  grant judgment in favor of  the verdict loser\n\nonly if  the evidence, so  viewed, is such that  reasonable minds\n\ncould not help  but reach an  outcome at  odds with the  verdict.\n\nSee  Rolon-Alvarado,  1  F.3d  at  77; Veranda  Beach  Club  Ltd.\n                                                                 \n\nPartnership v. Western Sur. Co., 936 F.2d 1364, 1383-84 (1st Cir.\n                               \n\n1991).\n\n          In  this case, appellant also moved for a new trial.  A\n\ntrial  court's denial  of such  a  motion is  examined through  a\n\nsomewhat different  glass.  See  Wagenmann, 829  F.2d at  200-01.\n                                          \n\nBut, although appellant  makes a passing  reference to the  trial\n\ncourt's  ruling  in   this  respect,  it  presents   no  reasoned\n\ndiscussion  of, or  analysis addressed  to, the new  trial issue.\n\nThat ends  the matter.   We are  firm adherents to  the principle\n\n\"that issues adverted  to on appeal in a  perfunctory manner, not\n\naccompanied by some  developed argumentation, are deemed  to have\n\nbeen abandoned.\"  Ryan v. Royal Ins.  Co., 916 F.2d 731, 734 (1st\n                                         \n\nCir. 1990); accord United States v. Zannino, 895  F.2d 1, 17 (1st\n                                           \n\nCir.), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1082 (1990).\n                   \n\nIII.  ANALYSIS\n\n            In handicap discrimination  cases brought pursuant to\n\nfederal  law,  the  claimant bears  the  burden  of  proving each\n\nelement of her chain.   See Joyner by Lowry v.  Dumpson, 712 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n720, 724 (2d  Cir. 1983); Sedor v.  Frank, 756 F. Supp.  684, 686\n                                         \n\n(D. Conn.  1991).   The elements derive  from section 504  of the\n\n                                5\n\nRehabilitation  Act,  which  provides in  relevant  part:   \"[n]o\n\notherwise qualified individual  . . . shall, solely  by reason of\n\nher or his disability, . . . be subjected to discrimination under\n\nany program or activity receiving  Federal financial assistance.\"\n\n29 U.S.C.   794(a).   To invoke the statute in  a failure-to-hire\n\ncase, a claimant must  prove four things:   (1) that she  applied\n\nfor  a post in a federally funded  program or activity, (2) that,\n\nat the time,  she suffered from a cognizable  disability, (3) but\n\nwas, nonetheless, qualified  for the position,  and (4) that  she\n\nwas not hired due solely to  her disability.  Here, MHRH concedes\n\nthat it received substantial federal funding for the operation of\n\nthe Ladd  Center.   We turn,  then, to the  remaining links  that\n\nforge the chain.  We subdivide our discussion into five segments,\n\nthe first three of which deal directly with the existence vel non\n                                                                 \n\nof a covered impairment (actual or perceived).\n\n                                A\n\n          The plaintiff proceeded below on a perceived disability\n\ntheory, positing  that she was fully able  although MHRH regarded\n\nher as physically  impaired.  These allegations state  a cause of\n\naction  under  the  Rehabilitation Act,  for  the  prophylaxis of\n\nsection  504 embraces  not only  those  persons who  are in  fact\n\ndisabled,  but  also  those  persons   who  bear  the  brunt   of\n\ndiscrimination  because   prospective  employers  view   them  as\n\ndisabled.   See 29 U.S.C.    706(b) (defining a  disabled person,\n               \n\nfor  Rehabilitation Act purposes, as any person who actually has,\n\nor who \"is regarded\" as  having, a \"physical or mental impairment\n\n                                6\n\nwhich substantially limits one or more of such persons major life\n\nactivities\").  Up to this  point in time, however, few \"perceived\n\ndisability\"  cases   have  been   litigated  and,   consequently,\n\ndecisional law involving the interplay  of perceived disabilities\n\nand section 504 is hen's-teeth rare.   Thus, this case calls upon\n\nus to explore new frontiers.\n\n          Our  task  is  greatly simplified  because  regulations\n\nimplementing the Rehabilitation Act,  promulgated by the  federal\n\nEqual Employment  Opportunity Commission (EEOC), limn  three ways\n\nin which a person can qualify for protection under section 504 on\n\nthe basis  of a perceived  disability.4  The trial  court charged\n\nthe jury that it could consider plaintiff's claim under the first\n\nand third methods,  but not under the second.   The plaintiff has\n\nnot cross-appealed  from this determination,  so we leave  to one\n\nside  cases  which, unlike  this  one, arguably  come  within the\n\n                    \n\n     4The regulations cover  persons who are \"regarded  as having\nan  impairment,\" and  provide that  the quoted  phrase refers  to\nsomeone who:\n\n          (A) has  a physical or mental impairment that\n          does  not  substantially   limit  major  life\n          activities but that is treated by a recipient\n          as constituting such a limitation; (B) has  a\n          physical    or    mental    impairment   that\n          substantially  limits  major  life activities\n          only as a  result of the attitudes  of others\n          toward such  impairment; or  (C) has none  of\n          the impairments defined in . . . this section\n          but  is treated by a recipient as having such\n          an impairment.\n\n45 C.F.R.    84.3(j)(2)(iv)  (1992).  The  word \"recipient\"  is a\nshorthand reference to a recipient  of federal funding, and, in a\nfailure-to-hire  case,  signifies  a  prospective employer  whose\n\"program or  activity receiv[es]  Federal financial  assistance.\"\n29 U.S.C.   794(a).\n\n                                7\n\npurview of 45 C.F.R.   84.3(j)(2)(iv)(B).\n\n          It   is  noteworthy   that   section  504's   perceived\n\ndisability  model  can be  satisfied  whether  or  not  a  person\n\nactually has a  physical or mental impairment.   See 45  C.F.R.  \n                                                    \n\n84.3(j)(2)(iv).    It  is also  noteworthy  that  the regulations\n\ndefine  the  term  \"physical or  mental  impairment\"  broadly; it\n\nincludes, inter  alia, any  physiological  disorder or  condition\n                     \n\nsignificantly   affecting   a   major   bodily   system,    e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nmusculoskeletal,  respiratory,  or  cardiovascular.   See  id.   \n                                                              \n\n84.3(j)(2)(i)(A).    The  term  also  encompasses  disorders  and\n\nconditions \"whose precise nature is  not at present known.\"  Id.,\n                                                                \n\nApp.  A, Subpart  A(3), at 377  (1992).  And  the regulations are\n\nopen-ended; they do not purport to \"set forth [an exclusive] list\n\nof  specific  diseases  and  conditions  . .  .  because  of  the\n\ndifficulty of ensuring  the comprehensiveness of any  such list.\"\n\nId.\n   \n\n          This  regulatory  framework  sets  the  stage  for  our\n\nanalysis.  In order to prevail on her perceived disability claim,\n\nCook had  to show  either that (1)  while she  had a  physical or\n\nmental impairment, it did not substantially limit her  ability to\n\nperform major life activities, 45 C.F.R.   84.3(j)(2)(iv)(A), or,\n\nalternatively,  that  (2)  she  did  not suffer  at  all  from  a\n\nstatutorily  prescribed  physical  or mental  impairment,  id.   \n                                                              \n\n84.3(j)(2)(iv)(C);5 and she also  had to prove that  MHRH treated\n\n                    \n\n     5The difference  between these  showings is  often not  very\ngreat.   For example,  a reviewing  court generally  must examine\nmuch the same  evidence to determine if plaintiff  had an actual,\n\n                                8\n\nher  impairment (whether  actual or  perceived)  as substantially\n\nlimiting  one or  more  of  her major  life  activities.   Id.   \n                                                              \n\n84.3(j)(2)(iv)(A),  (C).   Although  the  jury did  not  return a\n\nspecial finding as to whether plaintiff actually had a cognizable\n\nimpairment, or  was merely  regarded by MHRH  as having  one, the\n\ndistrict court,  without objection, charged  in the  alternative;\n\nhence, plaintiff is entitled to prevail on this appeal so long as\n\nthe evidence  supports recovery under  one of these  theories. In\n\nthis instance, we believe the record comfortably justifies either\n\nfinding.  We explain briefly.\n\n          On  one hand, the jury could  plausibly have found that\n\nplaintiff  had a physical  impairment; after all,  she admittedly\n\nsuffered  from morbid obesity, and she presented expert testimony\n\nthat  morbid  obesity  is a  physiological  disorder  involving a\n\ndysfunction of  both the  metabolic system  and the  neurological\n\nappetite-suppressing  signal system,  capable of  causing adverse\n\neffects    within   the    musculoskeletal,   respiratory,    and\n\ncardiovascular systems.  On the  second hand, the jury could have\n\nfound  that plaintiff, although  not handicapped, was  treated by\n\nMHRH  as if she had a physical impairment.  Indeed, MHRH's stated\n\nreasons for its refusal to hire   its concern that Cook's limited\n\nmobility impeded her  ability to evacuate patients in  case of an\n\nemergency, and its fear  that her condition augured a  heightened\n\nrisk  of  heart  disease, thereby  increasing  the  likelihood of\n\nworkers'  compensation  claims     show  conclusively  that  MHRH\n\n                    \n\nbut non-limiting, impairment, or if she had no impairment at all.\n\n                                9\n\ntreated  plaintiff's obesity  as  if  it  actually  affected  her\n\nmusculoskeletal and cardiovascular systems.6\n\n                                B\n\n          Appellant counterattacks on two fronts.   Neither foray\n\nsucceeds.\n\n           1.  Mutability.    MHRH baldly asserts  that \"mutable\"\n           1.  Mutability.\n                         \n\nconditions are  not the  sort of impairments  that can  find safe\n\nharbor in the lee of section 504.  It exacuates this assertion by\n\nclaiming  that morbid  obesity is a  mutable condition  and that,\n\ntherefore, one who suffers from  it is not handicapped within the\n\nmeaning of the federal law because she can simply lose weight and\n\nrid herself of any concomitant disability.  This suggestion is as\n\ninsubstantial as a pitchman's promise.\n\n          We  think it is  important to recognize  that appellant\n\nhas no legitimate complaint about the  trial court's choice among\n\nthe possible  variations  on the  applicable  legal theme.    The\n\ndistrict  judge sang appellant's  song, instructing the  jury, at\n\nappellant's  urging,  that a  \"condition  or disorder  is  not an\n\nimpairment unless  it .  . .  constitutes an  immutable condition\n\nthat the  person  affected  is  powerless to  control.\"7    Thus,\n\n                    \n\n     6We note, moreover, that MHRH's  decisionmaker, Dr. O'Brien,\nvoiced  the belief that  morbid obesity affects  \"virtually every\n[body]   system,\"    including   the    cardiovascular,   immune,\nmusculoskeletal, and sensory systems.\n\n     7We  believe  the  lower court's  basic  proposition    that\nimmutability is  a prerequisite to  the existence of  a permanent\nimpairment cognizable under  section 504, see Cook, 783  F. Supp.\n                                                  \nat 1573   is problematic.  Mutability is nowhere mentioned in the\nstatute or regulations, and we  see little reason to postulate it\nas an automatic disqualifier under section  504.  It seems to us,\n\n                                10\n\nappellant's mutability  complaint is necessarily addressed to the\n\nfacts.  As such, it is belied by the record.\n\n          In deciding this issue, the jury had before it credible\n\nevidence that metabolic  dysfunction, which leads to  weight gain\n\nin the  morbidly obese,  lingers even after  weight loss.   Given\n\nthis evidence, the jury reasonably could  have found that, though\n\npeople afflicted with morbid obesity can treat the manifestations\n\nof metabolic dysfunction by fasting or perennial undereating, the\n\nphysical  impairment itself    a  dysfunctional  metabolism    is\n\npermanent.   Cf. Gilbert  v. Frank,  949 F.2d  637, 641  (2d Cir.\n                                  \n\n1991)  (finding  that  kidney  disease   controllable  by  weekly\n\ndialysis constitutes a handicap under   504 of the Rehabilitation\n\nAct);  Reynolds v.  Brock,  815  F.2d 571,  573  (9th Cir.  1987)\n                         \n\n(holding  that epilepsy controllable by medication qualifies as a\n\nhandicap  under    504).   Hence,  the jury's  resolution of  the\n\nmutability question  rested on a sufficiently  sturdy evidentiary\n\nplatform.\n\n          There  is,   moreover,  another   dissonant  chord   in\n\nappellant's  paean  to  mutability.   Even  if  immutability were\n\nnormally  a prerequisite to finding a  covered impairment, as the\n\ndistrict  court's  charge  suggested, the  logic  of  a perceived\n\n                    \n\ninstead,  that mutability  is relevant  only  in determining  the\nsubstantiality of the limitation flowing from a given impairment.\nSo viewed,  mutability only  precludes those  conditions that  an\nindividual   can  easily   and  quickly  reverse   by  behavioral\nalteration from coming  within section 504.  But,  in the absence\nof a contemporaneous objection, the  charge became the law of the\ncase; and in  any event, the district court's  error is harmless,\nfor it worked to appellant's advantage.\n\n                                11\n\ndisability case, as embodied in  the regulations, see 45 C.F.R.  \n                                                     \n\n84.3(j)(2)(iv)(C),  would   nonetheless  defeat   the  doctrine's\n\napplication.  So  long as the prospective employer  responds to a\n\nperceived disability in a way  that makes clear that the employer\n\nregards the condition as  immutable, no more is exigible.   So it\n\nis here:   based on Dr. O'Brien's testimony,  the jury reasonably\n\ncould have inferred  that he regarded plaintiff's  morbid obesity\n\nas  an \"impairment of  a continuing  nature,\"   Evans v.  City of\n                                                                 \n\nDallas, 861 F.2d 846, 853 (5th Cir. 1988) (citation omitted), and\n      \n\nthat he rejected her application on that basis.8\n\n          2.  Voluntariness.  Appellant's  second assault regains\n          2.  Voluntariness.\n                           \n\nno  ground.   MHRH asseverates  that, because  morbid  obesity is\n\ncaused, or at least exacerbated, by voluntary  conduct, it cannot\n\nconstitute an impairment falling within the ambit of section 504.\n\nBut, this  asseveration rests on  a legally faulty premise.   The\n\nRehabilitation  Act  contains  no language  suggesting  that  its\n\nprotection is  linked to  how an  individual became  impaired, or\n\nwhether an individual  contributed to his or her  impairment.  On\n\nthe contrary, the Act indisputably applies to numerous conditions\n\nthat may be  caused or exacerbated by voluntary  conduct, such as\n\nalcoholism,  AIDS,  diabetes,  cancer  resulting  from  cigarette\n\nsmoking,  heart disease resulting from excesses of various types,\n\n                    \n\n     8Indeed,   Dr.   Blackburn,  appellant's   expert   witness,\ntestified that it is dangerous for a dieter to lose more than 20%\nof her total body weight each year.  Applying this formula to Dr.\nO'Brien's acknowledgment  that he  would have  rehired Cook  only\nwhen  she reduced her weight  to 190 pounds,  the jury could have\nconcluded  that appellant  treated plaintiff  as  if her  obesity\nwould have disqualified her from working for over two years.\n\n                                12\n\nand  the like.   See,  e.g., Severino  v.  North Fort  Myers Fire\n                                                                 \n\nControl  Dist., 935  F.2d  1179, 1182  (11th  Cir. 1991)  (AIDS);\n              \n\nTeahan v. Metro-North Commuter R. Co., 951 F.2d 511, 517 (2d Cir.\n                                     \n\n1991) (drug abuse), cert. denied, 113 S.

Supp. 570,  577  (D.D.C. 1991)  (alcoholism),\n         \n\naff'd, 988 F.2d 1280  (D.C.

The  instructions  (to which  appellant  did not  object)\n\nspecifically restricted  disabilities to  those conditions  \"that\n\nthe  person  affected  is  powerless  to  control.\"9   Given  the\n\nplethoric evidence introduced concerning the physiological  roots\n\nof morbid obesity, the  jury certainly could have  concluded that\n\nthe metabolic dysfunction  and failed appetite-suppressing neural\n\nsignals  were   beyond  plaintiff's  control  and   rendered  her\n\neffectively powerless to manage her weight.\n\n                                C\n\n          The next leg of our journey into the terra incognita of\n                                                              \n\nperceived  disabilities requires us  to explore whether  the jury\n\nproperly could have concluded that appellant regarded plaintiff's\n\ncondition as substantially limiting one or more of her major life\n\n                    \n\n     9We take no view of the correctness of the instruction.   We\nsimply  note that,  to  the extent  that  it may  be  flawed, the\npossible  error operates in appellant's favor and, is, therefore,\nharmless.\n\n                                13\n\nactivities.  See  45 C.F.R.   84.3(j)(2)(iv).   We bifurcate this\n                \n\nphase of our itinerary, examining the inquiry's two components in\n\nreverse order.\n\n          1.      Major  Life   Activities.      The  regulations\n          1.      Major  Life   Activities.\n                                          \n\nimplementing  section  504  define  \"major  life  activities\"  to\n\ninclude walking, breathing, working, and other manual tasks.  See\n                                                                 \n\nid.   84.3(j)(2)(ii).   In this case, Dr.  O'Brien testified that\n   \n\nhe refused to hire plaintiff  because he believed that her morbid\n\nobesity  interfered  with  her   ability  to  undertake  physical\n\nactivities,  including walking,  lifting, bending,  stooping, and\n\nkneeling,  to such  an  extent  that she  would  be incapable  of\n\nworking  as an  IA-MR.  On  this basis alone,  the jury plausibly\n\ncould  have   found  that  MHRH   viewed  plaintiff's   suspected\n\nimpairment as interfering with major life activities.  See, e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nPerez v. Philadelphia  Housing Auth.,  677 F.  Supp. 357,  360-61\n                                    \n\n(E.D.Pa.  1987) (finding that  abilities to walk,  sit, and stand\n\nconstitute major life activities), aff'd,  841 F.2d 1120 (3d Cir.\n                                        \n\n1988) (table).\n\n          2.  Substantiality of Limiting Effect.  The court below\n          2.  Substantiality of Limiting Effect.\n                                               \n\ninstructed the jury that it must decide whether appellant treated\n\nplaintiff as if  her condition \"substantially limited\" one of her\n\nmajor life activities.  Appellant  did not object to the district\n\ncourt's decision  to refrain from  further definition of  the key\n\nphrase,  and, absent a  contemporaneous objection, a  trial court\n\nordinarily may charge in the  language of a statute or regulation\n\nwithout further  elaboration.  See  United States v. De  La Cruz,\n                                                                \n\n                                14\n\n902  F.2d 121, 123 (1st Cir. 1990).   Thus, we reject out of hand\n\nappellant's insinuations that the lower court erred in neglecting\n\nto afford a more precise definition sua sponte.10\n                                              \n\n          Proceeding to the merits, we  think that the degree  of\n\nlimitation  fell  squarely  to the  jury  and  that  the evidence\n\nwarrants  its  finding  that  appellant  regarded  plaintiff   as\n\nsubstantially  impaired.   By  his  own  admission,  Dr.  O'Brien\n\nbelieved  plaintiff's  limitations  foreclosed a  broad  range of\n\nemployment  options  in  the   health  care  industry,  including\n\npositions  such  as  community living  aide,  nursing  home aide,\n\nhospital aide,  and  home  health  care aide.    Detached  jurors\n\nreasonably could have  found that this pessimistic  assessment of\n\nplaintiff's  capabilities  demonstrated that  appellant  regarded\n\nCook's  condition as substantially limiting a major life activity\n\n  being able to work.\n\n          Appellant  urges  that,   in  order  to  draw   such  a\n\nconclusion, the jury would have  had to engage in rank conjecture\n\nbecause plaintiff applied  for, and was  rejected from, only  one\n\njob.   In effect, appellant's  argument on this point  reduces to\n\nthe  notion  that  meeting  the  statutory  test  requires, as  a\n\n                    \n\n     10We note in passing that the term \"substantially limits\" is\nnot  defined in the  regulations.  Some  guidance in interpreting\nthis phrase can perhaps be  gleaned by looking to the regulations\nimplementing the  Americans with  Disabilities Act,  42 U.S.C.   \n12101  et seq.   (1993).    Those regulations  indicate that  the\n              \nquestion of whether an impairment is substantially limiting turns\non  \"(1) the  nature  and  severity of  the  impairment, (2)  the\nduration  or expected  duration of  the  impairment, and  (3) the\n[actual or expected] permanent  or long term impact . .  . of, or\nresulting from, the impairment.\"  29  C.F.R.   1630, App. at  403\n(1992).\n\n                                15\n\npreliminary  matter,  that  an individual  unsuccessfully  seek a\n\nmyriad  of  jobs.   We  cannot  accept  that notion  for  several\n\nreasons.   First,  such a  requirement is  contrary to  the plain\n\nreading of the statute and  regulations.  Under the \"regarded as\"\n\nprong  of section  504, a  plaintiff  can make  out a  cognizable\n\nperceived  disability claim by demonstrating that she was treated\n\nas if  she had  an impairment that  substantially limits  a major\n\nlife  activity.    See  45   C.F.R.     84.3(j)(2)(iv)(C).    The\n                      \n\nRehabilitation  Act  simply  does not  condition  such  claims on\n\neither the quantum of a plaintiff's application efforts or on her\n\nprospects  of finding other employment.   By way of illustration,\n\nsuit can be  brought against a warehouse operator  who refuses to\n\nhire  all turquoise-eyed  applicants  solely because  he believes\n\nthat  people  with  such coloring  are  universally  incapable of\n\nlifting  large  crates, notwithstanding  that  other warehousemen\n\nmight hire the applicants    or that the recalcitrant firm itself\n\nmight hire  them for  other, more sedentary  posts.   And placing\n\nclaims in this perspective makes good sense.  The  Rehabilitation\n\nAct  seeks not only  to aid the disabled,  but also to \"eliminate\n\ndiscrimination on the basis of handicap.\"  45 C.F.R.   84.1.\n\n          Then,    too,   conditioning    fulfillment   of    the\n\n\"substantially  limits\" test  on  multiple  rejections  would  be\n\ntantamount to  saying that the  law venerates the  performance of\n\nobviously  futile acts     a  proposition  we  consistently  have\n\nrefused  to espouse.   See,  e.g., Northern  Heel Corp.  v. Compo\n                                                                 \n\nIndus., Inc.,  851 F.2d  456, 461 (1st  Cir. 1988)  (stating that\n            \n\n                                16\n\n\"[t]he law  should not  be construed idly  to require  parties to\n\nperform  futile acts  or to  engage in  empty rituals);  see also\n                                                                 \n\nGilbert  v.  City  of  Cambridge,  932 F.2d  51,  60  (1st  Cir.)\n                                \n\n(discussing   \"futility   exception\"    to   permit   application\n\nrequirement), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 192 (1991).\n                          \n\n          We think it follows  that each case must  be determined\n\non  its own facts.   It also  follows that an  applicant need not\n\nsubject herself to a lengthy series of rejections at the hands of\n\nan insensitive employer to establish that the employer views  her\n\nlimitations as  substantial.   If the  rationale proffered  by an\n\nemployer in  the context of  a single refusal to  hire adequately\n\nevinces  that the  employer treats  a particular  condition  as a\n\ndisqualifier  for a wide range of employment opportunities, proof\n\nof a  far-flung pattern of rejections may  not be necessary.  Put\n\nin  slightly  more concrete  terms, denying  an applicant  even a\n\nsingle job that requires no unique physical skills, due solely to\n\nthe  perception  that  the  applicant  suffers  from  a  physical\n\nlimitations  that  would keep  her  from qualifying  for  a broad\n\nspectrum of jobs, can constitute  treating an applicant as if her\n\ncondition  substantially limited  a  major life  activity,  viz.,\n                                                                \n\nworking.  This is such a case.\n\n          The  precedents cited  by  appellant  are  not  to  the\n\ncontrary.   In each of them  the court concluded  that failure to\n\nqualify  for a  job  possessing  unique  qualifications  did  not\n\nconstitute a  substantial limitation  of a  major life  activity.\n\nSee, e.g., Welsh v. City of  Tulsa, 977 F.2d 1415, 1417-18  (10th\n                                  \n\n                                17\n\nCir. 1992) (upholding termination as  a fire fighter due to minor\n\nsensory loss  in one hand); Daley  v.

These  positions are a far cry from the IA-\n\nMR post that Cook coveted.  We think there is a significant legal\n\ndistinction between rejection based  on a job-specific perception\n\nthat  the applicant is  unable to excel  at a narrow  trade and a\n\nrejection based on more generalized perception that the applicant\n\nis impaired  in such a way as would bar her from a large class of\n\njobs.

The\n\nemployer's belief must be objectively reasonable.  It cannot rest\n\non  stereotypes  and  broad generalizations.    After  all, \"mere\n\npossession of a handicap is not a permissible ground for assuming\n\n                                19\n\nan inability  to function in  a particular context.\"   Davis, 442\n                                                            \n\nU.S. at 405 (footnote omitted).\n\n          Appellant's position, insofar as  we can understand it,\n\nis that  plaintiff's  morbid obesity  presented  such a  risk  to\n\nherself  and  the  Ladd  Center's  residents  that  she  was  not\n\notherwise   qualified,  or,  in  the  alternative,  that  it  was\n\nreasonable  for appellant to  believe that she  was not otherwise\n\nqualified.   This  protestation is  undone  by three  independent\n\nconsiderations.\n\n          First,  because  appellant's  evidence  on  this  point\n\nserves,  at most,  to  generate  a fact  question  as to  whether\n\nplaintiff  was  otherwise   qualified,  the  responsibility   for\n\nresolving this dispute properly fell to  the jury.  See Arline v.\n                                                              \n\nSchool Bd. of  Nassau County, 480 U.S. 283, 287 (1987).  The jury\n                            \n\nfound  specially that appellant  did not reasonably  believe that\n\nplaintiff lacked the requisite qualifications.

At trial, MHRH\n\nfailed to  make  specific  inquiries  into  plaintiff's  physical\n\nabilities  and  instead  relied on  generalizations  regarding an\n\nobese person's capabilities.   This is the strict  inverse of the\n\n\"fact-specific and  individualized\" inquiry, Arline, 480  U.S. at\n                                                   \n\n287, that the  Rehabilitation Act requires.   Indeed, appellant's\n\n\"evidence\" comprises  a  graphic illustration  of  an  employment\n\n                                20\n\ndecision based on  stereotyping   exactly the  sort of employment\n\ndecision that the Rehabilitation Act seeks to banish.\n\n          Third, one of appellant's  justifications for rejecting\n\nplaintiff     its  concern over  high  absenteeism  and increased\n\nworkers' compensation  costs   is  itself a prohibited  basis for\n\ndenying employment.   Unless absenteeism  rises to  a level  such\n\nthat  the applicant  is  no  longer  \"otherwise  qualified,\"  the\n\nRehabilitation  Act requires  employers to  bear  absenteeism and\n\nother  miscellaneous  burdens   involved  in  making   reasonable\n\naccommodationsin ordertopermit theemploymentof disabledpersons.11\n\n          We will not paint the lily.  Several pieces of evidence\n\nloom large  on this  issue.    Plaintiff received  a satisfactory\n\nreport   following   the   physical  examination   conducted   by\n\nappellant's own nurse; the  IA-MR position for which she  applied\n\ndid not demand any  elevated level of mobility,  lifting ability,\n\nsize,  or stature; plaintiff had satisfactorily performed all her\n\nduties and responsibilities as an  IA-MR during her previous five\n\n                    \n\n     11Implicit in  the Rehabilitation Act's requirement  that an\nemployer   who    receives   federal   funds    make   reasonable\naccommodations to allow a disabled employee to perform her job is\nthe concept that  the employer must absorb some  costs in working\n                                               \ntoward the goal of providing  meaningful employment opportunities\nfor disabled  persons.  See,  e.g., 45 C.F.R.    84.12 (requiring\n                                  \naccommodations  such  as  \"job   restructuring,\"  \"modified  work\nschedules,\"  \"acquisition   or  modification   of  equipment   or\ndevices,\"  and  the  like).   Such  accommodations  are necessary\nunless the employer can \"demonstrate that the accommodation would\nimpose an  undue hardship,\" which  is determined, inter  alia, by\n                                                             \nthe  \"nature and  cost\" of  the proposed  accommodation.   Id.,  \n                                                              \n84.12(b)(2);  see, e.g., Nelson v.  Thornburgh, 567 F. Supp. 369,\n                                              \n379  (E.D. Pa. 1983) (performing requisite balancing), aff'd, 732\n                                                            \nF.2d 146 (3rd Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1188 (1985).\n                                      \n\n                                21\n\nyears  of employment;12 and  MHRH acknowledged that  those duties\n\nand responsibilities  have not changed.   From  this, and  other,\n\nevidence,  we believe  that the  jury lawfully  could  have found\n\nplaintiff, apart from  any impairment,  \"otherwise qualified\"  to\n\nwork as an IA-MR.\n\n                                E\n\n          Our  last port  of  call  requires  that  we  determine\n\nwhether the  evidence justified a  finding that MHRH  turned down\n\nplaintiff's  request  for  employment due  solely  to  her morbid\n\nobesity.  This final piece of the puzzle is straightforward.\n\n          MHRH has not  offered a hint of  any non-weight-related\n\nreason for  rejecting plaintiff's  application.   Rather, it  has\n\nconsistently  conceded that it  gave plaintiff the  cold shoulder\n\nbecause Dr. O'Brien denied her  medical clearance.  The record is\n\npellucid that Dr. O'Brien's refusal had three foci, each of which\n\nrelated  directly  to  plaintiff's obesity.13    On  this record,\n\nthere was  considerable room  for a jury  to find  that appellant\n\ndeclined to hire Cook \"due solely to\" her perceived handicap.\n\nIV.  CONCLUSION\n\n                    \n\n     12To be sure,  plaintiff was not then morbidly  obese in the\nliteral sense.  Nevertheless, at  times during her prior tours of\nduty she weighed almost as much as she weighed when she reapplied\nin 1988.\n\n     13The point is  well illustrated in MHRH's  appellate brief,\nwhich states that Dr. O'Brien \"declined to give medical clearance\nto hire  the plaintiff based solely  on her weight.   Dr. O'Brien\ntestified that there were three reasons for his decision:  First,\nhe believed that  she herself was  at risk based on  her obesity;\nsecond, he believed that she  could put the retarded residents at\nrisk in emergency  situations; third, he was  concerned about the\noverall cost of Worker's Compensation injuries.\"\n\n                                22\n\n          We need go no further.  In a society that all too often\n\nconfuses  \"slim\" with \"beautiful\"  or \"good,\" morbid  obesity can\n\npresent  formidable barriers to employment.   Where, as here, the\n\nbarriers transgress  federal  law, those  who erect  and seek  to\n\npreserve them  must suffer the  consequences.  In this  case, the\n\nevidence adduced at trial amply supports the jury's determination\n\nthat MHRH  violated section 504  of the Rehabilitation Act.   And\n\nbecause MHRH refused  to hire plaintiff due solely  to her morbid\n\nobesity,  there is no cause to disturb either the damage award or\n\nthe equitable relief granted by the district court.\n\nAffirmed.\n        \n\n                                23\n",

Sec. 794 (1993 Supp.).  Concluding, as we do, that plaintiff's proof satisfied the burdens articulated by the district court in its jury instructions, we uphold the denial of defendant's various post-trial motions and affirm the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the times material hereto, defendant-appellant Department of Mental Health, Retardation, and Hospitals (MHRH), a subdivision of the Rhode Island state government, operated the Ladd Center as a residential facility for retarded persons.  Plaintiff-appellee Bonnie Cook worked at Ladd as an institutional attendant for the mentally retarded (IA-MR) from 1978 to 1980, and again from 1981 to 1986.  Both times she departed voluntarily, leaving behind a spotless work record.  The defendant concedes that Cook's past performance met its legitimate expectations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1988, when plaintiff reapplied for the identical position, she stood 5'2\"' tall and weighed over 320 pounds.  During the routine pre-hire physical, a nurse employed by MHRH concluded that plaintiff was morbidly obese<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> but found no limitations that impinged upon her ability to do the job.  Notwithstanding that plaintiff passed the physical examination, MHRH balked.  It claimed that Cook's morbid obesity compromised her ability to evacuate patients in case of an emergency and put her at greater risk of developing serious ailments (a \"fact\" that MHRH's hierarchs speculated would promote absenteeism and increase the likelihood of workers' compensation claims).  Consequently, MHRH refused to hire plaintiff for a vacant IA-MR position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cook did not go quietly into this dark night.  Invoking section 504, she sued MHRH in federal district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  MHRH moved to dismiss the complaint, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), averring that morbid obesity can never constitute a handicap within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act.  The district court denied the motion.  See Cook v. Rhode Island, 783 F.Supp. 1569 (D.R.I.1992).  Pretrial discovery followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due season, the parties tried the case to a jury.  At the close of the evidence, appellant moved for judgment as a matter of law.  The court reserved decision, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a), and submitted the case on special interrogatories (to which appellant interposed no objections).  The jury answered the interrogatories favorably to plaintiff<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and, by means of the accompanying general verdict, awarded her $100,000 in compensatory damages.  The district court denied appellant's motions for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial, entered judgment on the verdict, and granted equitable relief to the plaintiff.  MHRH lost little time in filing a notice of appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal contests liability, not remediation.  As formulated by MHRH, the appeal turns on whether there was sufficient evidence to permit a verdict in plaintiff's favor.  Thus, appellate review is plenary.  See Rolon-Alvarado v. Municipality of San Juan, 1 F.3d 74, 77 (1st Cir.1993);  Jordan-Milton Mach., Inc. v. F/V Teresa Marie, II, 978 F.2d 32, 34 (1st Cir.1992).  A reviewing court applies the same standard that governed adjudication of the Rule 50 motion below:  we \"scrutiniz[e] the proof and the inferences reasonably to be drawn therefrom in the light most hospitable to the nonmovant,\" Wagenmann v. Adams, 829 F.2d 196, 200 (1st Cir.1987), refraining entirely from \"differential factfinding,\" Rolon-Alvarado, 1 F.3d at 76.   In the process, we may \"not consider the credibility of witnesses, resolve conflicts in testimony, or evaluate the weight of the evidence.\"  Wagenmann, 829 F.2d at 200.   We can overturn a jury's verdict and grant judgment in favor of the verdict loser only if the evidence, so viewed, is such that reasonable minds could not help but reach an outcome at odds with the verdict.  See Rolon-Alvarado, 1 F.3d at 77;  Veranda Beach Club Ltd. Partnership v. Western Sur. Co., 936 F.2d 1364, 1383-84 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, appellant also moved for a new trial.  A trial court's denial of such a motion is examined through a somewhat different glass.  See Wagenmann, 829 F.2d at 200-01.   But, although appellant makes a passing reference to the trial court's ruling in this respect, it presents no reasoned discussion of, or analysis addressed to, the new trial issue.  That ends the matter.  We are firm adherents to the principle \"that issues adverted to on appeal in a perfunctory manner, not accompanied by some developed argumentation, are deemed to have been abandoned.\"  Ryan v. Royal Ins. Co., 916 F.2d 731, 734 (1st Cir.1990);  accord United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1082, 110 S.Ct. 1814, 108 L.Ed.2d 944 (1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In handicap discrimination cases brought pursuant to federal law, the claimant bears the burden of proving each element of her chain.  See Joyner by Lowry v. Dumpson, 712 F.2d 770, 774 (2d Cir.1983);  Sedor v. Frank, 756 F.Supp. 684, 686 (D.Conn.1991).  The elements derive from section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, which provides in relevant part:  \"[n]o otherwise qualified individual ... shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, ... be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\"  29 U.S.C. Sec. 794(a).  To invoke the statute in a failure-to-hire case, a claimant must prove four things:  (1) that she applied for a post in a federally funded program or activity, (2) that, at the time, she suffered from a cognizable disability, (3) but was, nonetheless, qualified for the position, and (4) that she was not hired due solely to her disability.  Here, MHRH concedes that it received substantial federal funding for the operation of the Ladd Center.  We turn, then, to the remaining links that forge the chain.  We subdivide our discussion into five segments, the first three of which deal directly with the existence vel non of a covered impairment (actual or perceived).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* The plaintiff proceeded below on a perceived disability theory, positing that she was fully able although MHRH regarded her as physically impaired.  These allegations state a cause of action under the Rehabilitation Act, for the prophylaxis of section 504 embraces not only those persons who are in fact disabled, but also those persons who bear the brunt of discrimination because prospective employers view them as disabled.  See 29 U.S.C. Sec. 706(8)(B) (defining a disabled person, for Rehabilitation Act purposes, as any person who actually has, or who \"is regarded\" as having, a \"physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such persons major life activities\").  Up to this point in time, however, few \"perceived disability\" cases have been litigated and, consequently, decisional law involving the interplay of perceived disabilities and section 504 is hen's-teeth rare.  Thus, this case calls upon us to explore new frontiers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our task is greatly simplified because regulations implementing the Rehabilitation Act, promulgated by the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), limn three ways in which a person can qualify for protection under section 504 on the basis of a perceived disability.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The trial court charged the jury that it could consider plaintiff's claim under the first and third methods, but not under the second.  The plaintiff has not cross-appealed from this determination, so we leave to one side cases which, unlike this one, arguably come within the purview of 45 C.F.R. Sec. 84.3(j)(2)(iv)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is noteworthy that section 504's perceived disability model can be satisfied whether or not a person actually has a physical or mental impairment.  See 45 C.F.R. Sec. 84.3(j)(2)(iv).  It is also noteworthy that the regulations define the term \"physical or mental impairment\" broadly;  it includes, inter alia, any physiological disorder or condition significantly affecting a major bodily system, e.g., musculoskeletal, respiratory, or cardiovascular.  See id. Sec. 84.3(j)(2)(i)(A).  The term also encompasses disorders and conditions \"whose precise nature is not at present known.\"   Id., App.  A, Subpart A(3), at 377 (1992).  And the regulations are openended;  they do not purport to \"set forth [an exclusive] list of specific diseases and conditions ... because of the difficulty of ensuring the comprehensiveness of any such list.\"   Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This regulatory framework sets the stage for our analysis.  In order to prevail on her perceived disability claim, Cook had to show either that (1) while she had a physical or mental impairment, it did not substantially limit her ability to perform major life activities, 45 C.F.R. Sec. 84.3(j)(2)(iv)(A), or, alternatively, that (2) she did not suffer at all from a statutorily prescribed physical or mental impairment, id. Sec. 84.3(j)(2)(iv)(C);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  and she also had to prove that MHRH treated her impairment (whether actual or perceived) as substantially limiting one or more of her major life activities.  Id. Sec. 84.3(j)(2)(iv)(A), (C).  Although the jury did not return a special finding as to whether plaintiff actually had a cognizable impairment, or was merely regarded by MHRH as having one, the district court, without objection, charged in the alternative;  hence, plaintiff is entitled to prevail on this appeal so long as the evidence supports recovery under one of these theories.  In this instance, we believe the record comfortably justifies either finding.  We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On one hand, the jury could plausibly have found that plaintiff had a physical impairment;  after all, she admittedly suffered from morbid obesity, and she presented expert testimony that morbid obesity is a physiological disorder involving a dysfunction of both the metabolic system and the neurological appetite-suppressing signal system, capable of causing adverse effects within the musculoskeletal, respiratory, and cardiovascular systems.  On the second hand, the jury could have found that plaintiff, although not handicapped, was treated by MHRH as if she had a physical impairment.  Indeed, MHRH's stated reasons for its refusal to hire--its concern that Cook's limited mobility impeded her ability to evacuate patients in case of an emergency, and its fear that her condition augured a heightened risk of heart disease, thereby increasing the likelihood of workers' compensation claims--show conclusively that MHRH treated plaintiff's obesity as if it actually affected her musculoskeletal and cardiovascular systems.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant counterattacks on two fronts.  Neither foray succeeds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Mutability.   MHRH baldly asserts that \"mutable\" conditions are not the sort of impairments that can find safe harbor in the lee of section 504.  It exacuates this assertion by claiming that morbid obesity is a mutable condition and that, therefore, one who suffers from it is not handicapped within the meaning of the federal law because she can simply lose weight and rid herself of any concomitant disability.  This suggestion is as insubstantial as a pitchman's promise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it is important to recognize that appellant has no legitimate complaint about the trial court's choice among the possible variations on the applicable legal theme.  The district judge sang appellant's song, instructing the jury, at appellant's urging, that a \"condition or disorder is not an impairment unless it ... constitutes an immutable condition that the person affected is powerless to control.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Thus, appellant's mutability complaint is necessarily addressed to the facts.  As such, it is belied by the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In deciding this issue, the jury had before it credible evidence that metabolic dysfunction, which leads to weight gain in the morbidly obese, lingers even after weight loss.  Given this evidence, the jury reasonably could have found that, though people afflicted with morbid obesity can treat the manifestations of metabolic dysfunction by fasting or perennial undereating, the physical impairment itself--a dysfunctional metabolism--is permanent.  Cf. Gilbert v. Frank, 949 F.2d 637, 641 (2d Cir.1991) (finding that kidney disease controllable by weekly dialysis constitutes a handicap under Sec. 504 of the Rehabilitation Act);  Reynolds v. Brock, 815 F.2d 571, 573 (9th Cir.1987) (holding that epilepsy controllable by medication qualifies as a handicap under Sec. 504).  Hence, the jury's resolution of the mutability question rested on a sufficiently sturdy evidentiary platform.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is, moreover, another dissonant chord in appellant's paean to mutability.  Even if immutability were normally a prerequisite to finding a covered impairment, as the district court's charge suggested, the logic of a perceived disability case, as embodied in the regulations, see 45 C.F.R. Sec. 84.3(j)(2)(iv)(C), would nonetheless defeat the doctrine's application.  So long as the prospective employer responds to a perceived disability in a way that makes clear that the employer regards the condition as immutable, no more is exigible.  So it is here:  based on Dr. O'Brien's testimony, the jury reasonably could have inferred that he regarded plaintiff's morbid obesity as an \"impairment of a continuing nature,\" Evans v. City of Dallas, 861 F.2d 846, 853 (5th Cir.1988) (citation omitted), and that he rejected her application on that basis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Voluntariness.   Appellant's second assault regains no ground.  MHRH asseverates that, because morbid obesity is caused, or at least exacerbated, by voluntary conduct, it cannot constitute an impairment falling within the ambit of section 504.  But, this asseveration rests on a legally faulty premise.  The Rehabilitation Act contains no language suggesting that its protection is linked to how an individual became impaired, or whether an individual contributed to his or her impairment.  On the contrary, the Act indisputably applies to numerous conditions that may be caused or exacerbated by voluntary conduct, such as alcoholism, AIDS, diabetes, cancer resulting from cigarette smoking, heart disease resulting from excesses of various types, and the like.  See, e.g., Severino v. North Fort Myers Fire Control Dist., 935 F.2d 1179, 1182 (11th Cir.1991) (AIDS);  Teahan v. Metro-North Commuter R. Co., 951 F.2d 511, 517 (2d Cir.1991) (drug abuse), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 54, 121 L.Ed.2d 24 (1992);  Gallagher v. Catto, 778 F.Supp. 570, 577 (D.D.C.1991) (alcoholism), aff'd, 988 F.2d 1280 (D.C.Cir.1993);  see also 45 C.F.R. Sec. 84, App.  A, Subpart A(3) at 377 (cancer;  heart disease).  Consequently, voluntariness, like mutability, is relevant only in determining whether a condition has a substantially limiting effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's premise fares no better as a matter of fact.  The instructions (to which appellant did not object) specifically restricted disabilities to those conditions \"that the person affected is powerless to control.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Given the plethoric evidence introduced concerning the physiological roots of morbid obesity, the jury certainly could have concluded that the metabolic dysfunction and failed appetite-suppressing neural signals were beyond plaintiff's control and rendered her effectively powerless to manage her weight.C</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next leg of our journey into the terra incognita of perceived disabilities requires us to explore whether the jury properly could have concluded that appellant regarded plaintiff's condition as substantially limiting one or more of her major life activities.  See 45 C.F.R. Sec. 84.3(j)(2)(iv).  We bifurcate this phase of our itinerary, examining the inquiry's two components in reverse order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Major Life Activities.   The regulations implementing section 504 define \"major life activities\" to include walking, breathing, working, and other manual tasks.  See id. Sec. 84.3(j)(2)(ii).  In this case, Dr. O'Brien testified that he refused to hire plaintiff because he believed that her morbid obesity interfered with her ability to undertake physical activities, including walking, lifting, bending, stooping, and kneeling, to such an extent that she would be incapable of working as an IA-MR.  On this basis alone, the jury plausibly could have found that MHRH viewed plaintiff's suspected impairment as interfering with major life activities.  See, e.g., Perez v. Philadelphia Housing Auth., 677 F.Supp. 357, 360-61 (E.D.Pa.1987) (finding that abilities to walk, sit, and stand constitute major life activities), aff'd, 841 F.2d 1120 (3d Cir.1988) (table).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Substantiality of Limiting Effect.   The court below instructed the jury that it must decide whether appellant treated plaintiff as if her condition \"substantially limited\" one of her major life activities.  Appellant did not object to the district court's decision to refrain from further definition of the key phrase, and, absent a contemporaneous objection, a trial court ordinarily may charge in the language of a statute or regulation without further elaboration.  See United States v. De La Cruz, 902 F.2d 121, 123 (1st Cir.1990).  Thus, we reject out of hand appellant's insinuations that the lower court erred in neglecting to afford a more precise definition sua sponte.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Proceeding to the merits, we think that the degree of limitation fell squarely to the jury and that the evidence warrants its finding that appellant regarded plaintiff as substantially impaired.  By his own admission, Dr. O'Brien believed plaintiff's limitations foreclosed a broad range of employment options in the health care industry, including positions such as community living aide, nursing home aide, hospital aide, and home health care aide.  Detached jurors reasonably could have found that this pessimistic assessment of plaintiff's capabilities demonstrated that appellant regarded Cook's condition as substantially limiting a major life activity--being able to work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant urges that, in order to draw such a conclusion, the jury would have had to engage in rank conjecture because plaintiff applied for, and was rejected from, only one job.  In effect, appellant's argument on this point reduces to the notion that meeting the statutory test requires, as a preliminary matter, that an individual unsuccessfully seek a myriad of jobs.  We cannot accept that notion for several reasons.  First, such a requirement is contrary to the plain reading of the statute and regulations.  Under the \"regarded as\" prong of section 504, a plaintiff can make out a cognizable perceived disability claim by demonstrating that she was treated as if she had an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity.  See 45 C.F.R. Sec. 84.3(j)(2)(iv)(C).  The Rehabilitation Act simply does not condition such claims on either the quantum of a plaintiff's application efforts or on her prospects of finding other employment.  By way of illustration, suit can be brought against a warehouse operator who refuses to hire all turquoise-eyed applicants solely because he believes that people with such coloring are universally incapable of lifting large crates, notwithstanding that other warehousemen might hire the applicants--or that the recalcitrant firm itself might hire them for other, more sedentary posts.  And placing claims in this perspective makes good sense.  The Rehabilitation Act seeks not only to aid the disabled, but also to \"eliminate discrimination on the basis of handicap.\"  45 C.F.R. Sec. 84.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Then, too, conditioning fulfillment of the \"substantially limits\" test on multiple rejections would be tantamount to saying that the law venerates the performance of obviously futile acts--a proposition we consistently have refused to espouse.  See, e.g., Northern Heel Corp. v. Compo Indus., Inc., 851 F.2d 456, 461 (1st Cir.1988) (stating that \"[t]he law should not be construed idly to require parties to perform futile acts or to engage in empty rituals);  see also Gilbert v. City of Cambridge, 932 F.2d 51, 60 (1st Cir.)  (discussing \"futility exception\" to permit application requirement), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 192, 116 L.Ed.2d 153 (1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it follows that each case must be determined on its own facts.  It also follows that an applicant need not subject herself to a lengthy series of rejections at the hands of an insensitive employer to establish that the employer views her limitations as substantial.  If the rationale proffered by an employer in the context of a single refusal to hire adequately evinces that the employer treats a particular condition as a disqualifier for a wide range of employment opportunities, proof of a far-flung pattern of rejections may not be necessary.  Put in slightly more concrete terms, denying an applicant even a single job that requires no unique physical skills, due solely to the perception that the applicant suffers from a physical limitations that would keep her from qualifying for a broad spectrum of jobs, can constitute treating an applicant as if her condition substantially limited a major life activity, viz., working.  This is such a case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The precedents cited by appellant are not to the contrary.  In each of them the court concluded that failure to qualify for a job possessing unique qualifications did not constitute a substantial limitation of a major life activity.  See, e.g., Welsh v. City of Tulsa, 977 F.2d 1415, 1417-18 (10th Cir.1992) (upholding termination as a fire fighter due to minor sensory loss in one hand);  Daley v. Koch, 892 F.2d 212, 214-16 (2d Cir.1989) (sustaining rejection as police officer because of personality traits of poor judgment and irresponsibility);  Tudyman v. United Airlines, 608 F.Supp. 739, 746 (C.D.Cal.1984) (sustaining termination as airline steward due to bodybuilder's bulk).  These positions are a far cry from the IA-MR post that Cook coveted.  We think there is a significant legal distinction between rejection based on a job-specific perception that the applicant is unable to excel at a narrow trade and a rejection based on more generalized perception that the applicant is impaired in such a way as would bar her from a large class of jobs.  Cf. Welsh, 977 F.2d at 1419 (noting that factors relevant to determining whether an impairment is substantially limiting include \"(1) the number and type of jobs from which the impaired individual is disqualified, (2) the geographical area to which the individual has reasonable access, and (3) the individual's job expectations and training\") (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the jury rationally could have concluded that MHRH's perception of what it thought to be plaintiff's impairment, as exhibited in its refusal to hire her for the IA-MR position, foreclosed a sufficiently wide range of jobs to serve as proof of a substantial limitation.  Accordingly, the district court appropriately refused to direct a verdict for the employer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next stop on our odyssey requires us to consider whether there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that plaintiff was \"otherwise qualified\" to work as an IA-MR.  Once again, an affirmative answer emerges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"An otherwise qualified person is one who is able to meet all of a program's requirements in spite of h[er] handicap.\"  Southeastern Community Coll. v. Davis, 442 U.S. 397, 406, 99 S.Ct. 2361, 2366, 60 L.Ed.2d 980 (1979).  Although an employer is not required to be unfailingly correct in assessing a person's qualifications for a job, see Bento v. I.T.O. Corp., 599 F.Supp. 731, 744-45 (D.R.I.1984), an employer cannot act solely on the basis of subjective beliefs.  An unfounded assumption that an applicant is unqualified for a particular job, even if arrived at in good faith, is not sufficient to forestall liability under section 504.  See Pushkin v. Regents of Univ. of Colo., 658 F.2d 1372 (10th Cir.1981) (rejecting good faith as a defense under Sec. 504 because \"[d]iscrimination on the basis of handicap usually ... occurs under the guise of extending a helping hand or a mistaken, restrictive belief as to the limitations of handicapped persons\");  see also Carter v. Casa Central, 849 F.2d 1048, 1056 (7th Cir.1988) (explaining that \"[a]n employer's concerns about the abilities of a handicapped employee ... must be based on more than 'reflective' reactions about a handicapped individual's ability to do the job, no matter how well-intentioned\").  The employer's belief must be objectively reasonable.  It cannot rest on stereotypes and broad generalizations.  After all, \"mere possession of a handicap is not a permissible ground for assuming an inability to function in a particular context.\"  Davis, 442 U.S. at 405, 99 S.Ct. at 2366 (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's position, insofar as we can understand it, is that plaintiff's morbid obesity presented such a risk to herself and the Ladd Center's residents that she was not otherwise qualified, or, in the alternative, that it was reasonable for appellant to believe that she was not otherwise qualified.  This protestation is undone by three independent considerations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, because appellant's evidence on this point serves, at most, to generate a fact question as to whether plaintiff was otherwise qualified, the responsibility for resolving this dispute properly fell to the jury.  See School Bd. of Nassau County v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273, 287, 107 S.Ct. 1123, 1128, 94 L.Ed.2d 307 (1987).  The jury found specially that appellant did not reasonably believe that plaintiff lacked the requisite qualifications.  See supra note 3.  Having carefully scrutinized the record, we see no principled way in which we can scuttle this finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, we question whether appellant has put forward evidence sufficient to beget a factual question.  At trial, MHRH failed to make specific inquiries into plaintiff's physical abilities and instead relied on generalizations regarding an obese person's capabilities.  This is the strict inverse of the \"fact-specific and individualized\" inquiry, Arline, 480 U.S. at 287, that the Rehabilitation Act requires.  Indeed, appellant's \"evidence\" comprises a graphic illustration of an employment decision based on stereotyping--exactly the sort of employment decision that the Rehabilitation Act seeks to banish.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, one of appellant's justifications for rejecting plaintiff--its concern over high absenteeism and increased workers' compensation costs--is itself a prohibited basis for denying employment.  Unless absenteeism rises to a level such that the applicant is no longer \"otherwise qualified,\" the Rehabilitation Act requires employers to bear absenteeism and other miscellaneous burdens involved in making reasonable accommodations in order to permit the employment of disabled persons.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will not paint the lily.  Several pieces of evidence loom large on this issue.  Plaintiff received a satisfactory report following the physical examination conducted by appellant's own nurse;  the IA-MR position for which she applied did not demand any elevated level of mobility, lifting ability, size, or stature;  plaintiff had satisfactorily performed all her duties and responsibilities as an IA-MR during her previous five years of employment;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  and MHRH acknowledged that those duties and responsibilities have not changed.  From this, and other, evidence, we believe that the jury lawfully could have found plaintiff, apart from any impairment, \"otherwise qualified\" to work as an IA-MR.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>E</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our last port of call requires that we determine whether the evidence justified a finding that MHRH turned down plaintiff's request for employment due solely to her morbid obesity.  This final piece of the puzzle is straightforward.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MHRH has not offered a hint of any non-weight-related reason for rejecting plaintiff's application.  Rather, it has consistently conceded that it gave plaintiff the cold shoulder because Dr. O'Brien denied her medical clearance.  The record is pellucid that Dr. O'Brien's refusal had three foci, each of which related directly to plaintiff's obesity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  On this record, there was considerable room for a jury to find that appellant declined to hire Cook \"due solely to\" her perceived handicap.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  In a society that all too often confuses \"slim\" with \"beautiful\" or \"good,\" morbid obesity can present formidable barriers to employment.  Where, as here, the barriers transgress federal law, those who erect and seek to preserve them must suffer the consequences.  In this case, the evidence adduced at trial amply supports the jury's determination that MHRH violated section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  And because MHRH refused to hire plaintiff due solely to her morbid obesity, there is no cause to disturb either the damage award or the equitable relief granted by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The medical profession considers a person morbidly obese if she weighs either more than twice her optimal weight or more than 100 pounds over her optimal weight.

Mutability is nowhere mentioned in the statute or regulations, and we see little reason to postulate it as an automatic disqualifier under section 504.  It seems to us, instead, that mutability is relevant only in determining the substantiality of the limitation flowing from a given impairment.  So viewed, mutability only precludes those conditions that an individual can easily and quickly reverse by behavioral alteration from coming within section 504.  But, in the absence of a contemporaneous objection, the charge became the law of the case;  and in any event, the district court's error is harmless, for it worked to appellant's advantage</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Indeed, Dr. Blackburn, appellant's expert witness, testified that it is dangerous for a dieter to lose more than 20% of her total body weight each year.

Some guidance in interpreting this phrase can perhaps be gleaned by looking to the regulations implementing the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 12101 et seq.  (1993).  Those regulations indicate that the question of whether an impairment is substantially limiting turns on \"(1) the nature and severity of the impairment, (2) the duration or expected duration of the impairment, and (3) the [actual or expected] permanent or long term impact ... of, or resulting from, the impairment.\"  29 C.F.R.

Sec. 794 (1993 Supp.).  Concluding, as we do, that plaintiff's proof satisfied the burdens articulated by the district court in its jury instructions, we uphold the denial of defendant's various post-trial motions and affirm the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the times material hereto, defendant-appellant Department of Mental Health, Retardation, and Hospitals (MHRH), a subdivision of the Rhode Island state government, operated the Ladd Center as a residential facility for retarded persons.  Plaintiff-appellee Bonnie Cook worked at Ladd as an institutional attendant for the mentally retarded (IA-MR) from 1978 to 1980, and again from 1981 to 1986.  Both times she departed voluntarily, leaving behind a spotless work record.  The defendant concedes that Cook's past performance met its legitimate expectations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1988, when plaintiff reapplied for the identical position, she stood 5'2\"' tall and weighed over 320 pounds.  During the routine pre-hire physical, a nurse employed by MHRH concluded that plaintiff was morbidly obese<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> but found no limitations that impinged upon her ability to do the job.  Notwithstanding that plaintiff passed the physical examination, MHRH balked.  It claimed that Cook's morbid obesity compromised her ability to evacuate patients in case of an emergency and put her at greater risk of developing serious ailments (a \"fact\" that MHRH's hierarchs speculated would promote absenteeism and increase the likelihood of workers' compensation claims).  Consequently, MHRH refused to hire plaintiff for a vacant IA-MR position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cook did not go quietly into this dark night.  Invoking section 504, she sued MHRH in federal district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  MHRH moved to dismiss the complaint, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), averring that morbid obesity can never constitute a handicap within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act.  The district court denied the motion.  See Cook v. Rhode Island, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1362094\"><a href=\"/opinion/1362094/cook-v-state-of-ri-dept-of-mhrh/\"><span class=\"volume\">783</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Pretrial discovery followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due season, the parties tried the case to a jury.  At the close of the evidence, appellant moved for judgment as a matter of law.  The court reserved decision, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a), and submitted the case on special interrogatories (to which appellant interposed no objections).  The jury answered the interrogatories favorably to plaintiff<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and, by means of the accompanying general verdict, awarded her $100,000 in compensatory damages.  The district court denied appellant's motions for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial, entered judgment on the verdict, and granted equitable relief to the plaintiff.  MHRH lost little time in filing a notice of appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal contests liability, not remediation.  As formulated by MHRH, the appeal turns on whether there was sufficient evidence to permit a verdict in plaintiff's favor.  Thus, appellate review is plenary.  See Rolon-Alvarado v. Municipality of San Juan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194861\"><a href=\"/opinion/194861/rolon-alvarado-v-municipality-of-sj/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span>, 77 (1st Cir.1993);  Jordan-Milton Mach., Inc. v.

A reviewing court applies the same standard that governed adjudication of the Rule 50 motion below:  we \"scrutiniz[e] the proof and the inferences reasonably to be drawn therefrom in the light most hospitable to the nonmovant,\" Wagenmann v. Adams, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"494589\"><a href=\"/opinion/494589/ronald-e-wagenmann-v-russell-j-adams-appeal-of-gerald-r-anderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">829</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">196</span></a></span>, 200 (1st Cir.1987), refraining entirely from \"differential factfinding,\" Rolon-Alvarado, 1 F.3d at 76.   In the process, we may \"not consider the credibility of witnesses, resolve conflicts in testimony, or evaluate the weight of the evidence.\"  Wagenmann, 829 F.2d at 200.   We can overturn a jury's verdict and grant judgment in favor of the verdict loser only if the evidence, so viewed, is such that reasonable minds could not help but reach an outcome at odds with the verdict.  See Rolon-Alvarado, 1 F.3d at 77;  Veranda Beach Club Ltd. Partnership v. Western Sur. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563774\"><a href=\"/opinion/563774/veranda-beach-club-limited-partnership-v-western-surety-co-frg-ventures/\"><span class=\"volume\">936</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1364</span></a></span>, 1383-84 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, appellant also moved for a new trial.  A trial court's denial of such a motion is examined through a somewhat different glass.  See Wagenmann, 829 F.2d at 200-01.   But, although appellant makes a passing reference to the trial court's ruling in this respect, it presents no reasoned discussion of, or analysis addressed to, the new trial issue.  That ends the matter.

ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In handicap discrimination cases brought pursuant to federal law, the claimant bears the burden of proving each element of her chain.  See Joyner by Lowry v. Dumpson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"421815\"><a href=\"/opinion/421815/jay-andrew-joyner-by-his-attorney-and-next-friend-marcia-robinson-lowry/\"><span class=\"volume\">712</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">770</span></a></span>, 774 (2d Cir.1983);  Sedor v. Frank, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2291828\"><a href=\"/opinion/2291828/sedor-v-frank/\"><span class=\"volume\">756</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">684</span></a></span>, 686 (D.Conn.1991).  The elements derive from section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, which provides in relevant part:  \"[n]o otherwise qualified individual ... shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, ... be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\"  29 U.S.C. Sec. 794(a).  To invoke the statute in a failure-to-hire case, a claimant must prove four things:  (1) that she applied for a post in a federally funded program or activity, (2) that, at the time, she suffered from a cognizable disability, (3) but was, nonetheless, qualified for the position, and (4) that she was not hired due solely to her disability.  Here, MHRH concedes that it received substantial federal funding for the operation of the Ladd Center.  We turn, then, to the remaining links that forge the chain.  We subdivide our discussion into five segments, the first three of which deal directly with the existence vel non of a covered impairment (actual or perceived).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* The plaintiff proceeded below on a perceived disability theory, positing that she was fully able although MHRH regarded her as physically impaired.  These allegations state a cause of action under the Rehabilitation Act, for the prophylaxis of section 504 embraces not only those persons who are in fact disabled, but also those persons who bear the brunt of discrimination because prospective employers view them as disabled.  See 29 U.S.C. Sec. 706(8)(B) (defining a disabled person, for Rehabilitation Act purposes, as any person who actually has, or who \"is regarded\" as having, a \"physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such persons major life activities\").  Up to this point in time, however, few \"perceived disability\" cases have been litigated and, consequently, decisional law involving the interplay of perceived disabilities and section 504 is hen's-teeth rare.  Thus, this case calls upon us to explore new frontiers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our task is greatly simplified because regulations implementing the Rehabilitation Act, promulgated by the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), limn three ways in which a person can qualify for protection under section 504 on the basis of a perceived disability.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The trial court charged the jury that it could consider plaintiff's claim under the first and third methods, but not under the second.  The plaintiff has not cross-appealed from this determination, so we leave to one side cases which, unlike this one, arguably come within the purview of 45 C.F.R. Sec. 84.3(j)(2)(iv)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is noteworthy that section 504's perceived disability model can be satisfied whether or not a person actually has a physical or mental impairment.  See 45 C.F.R. Sec. 84.3(j)(2)(iv).  It is also noteworthy that the regulations define the term \"physical or mental impairment\" broadly;  it includes, inter alia, any physiological disorder or condition significantly affecting a major bodily system, e.g., musculoskeletal, respiratory, or cardiovascular.  See id. Sec. 84.3(j)(2)(i)(A).  The term also encompasses disorders and conditions \"whose precise nature is not at present known.\"   Id., App.  A, Subpart A(3), at 377 (1992).  And the regulations are openended;  they do not purport to \"set forth [an exclusive] list of specific diseases and conditions ... because of the difficulty of ensuring the comprehensiveness of any such list.\"   Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This regulatory framework sets the stage for our analysis.  In order to prevail on her perceived disability claim, Cook had to show either that (1) while she had a physical or mental impairment, it did not substantially limit her ability to perform major life activities, 45 C.F.R. Sec. 84.3(j)(2)(iv)(A), or, alternatively, that (2) she did not suffer at all from a statutorily prescribed physical or mental impairment, id. Sec. 84.3(j)(2)(iv)(C);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  and she also had to prove that MHRH treated her impairment (whether actual or perceived) as substantially limiting one or more of her major life activities.  Id. Sec. 84.3(j)(2)(iv)(A), (C).  Although the jury did not return a special finding as to whether plaintiff actually had a cognizable impairment, or was merely regarded by MHRH as having one, the district court, without objection, charged in the alternative;  hence, plaintiff is entitled to prevail on this appeal so long as the evidence supports recovery under one of these theories.  In this instance, we believe the record comfortably justifies either finding.  We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On one hand, the jury could plausibly have found that plaintiff had a physical impairment;  after all, she admittedly suffered from morbid obesity, and she presented expert testimony that morbid obesity is a physiological disorder involving a dysfunction of both the metabolic system and the neurological appetite-suppressing signal system, capable of causing adverse effects within the musculoskeletal, respiratory, and cardiovascular systems.  On the second hand, the jury could have found that plaintiff, although not handicapped, was treated by MHRH as if she had a physical impairment.  Indeed, MHRH's stated reasons for its refusal to hire--its concern that Cook's limited mobility impeded her ability to evacuate patients in case of an emergency, and its fear that her condition augured a heightened risk of heart disease, thereby increasing the likelihood of workers' compensation claims--show conclusively that MHRH treated plaintiff's obesity as if it actually affected her musculoskeletal and cardiovascular systems.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant counterattacks on two fronts.  Neither foray succeeds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Mutability.   MHRH baldly asserts that \"mutable\" conditions are not the sort of impairments that can find safe harbor in the lee of section 504.  It exacuates this assertion by claiming that morbid obesity is a mutable condition and that, therefore, one who suffers from it is not handicapped within the meaning of the federal law because she can simply lose weight and rid herself of any concomitant disability.  This suggestion is as insubstantial as a pitchman's promise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it is important to recognize that appellant has no legitimate complaint about the trial court's choice among the possible variations on the applicable legal theme.  The district judge sang appellant's song, instructing the jury, at appellant's urging, that a \"condition or disorder is not an impairment unless it ... constitutes an immutable condition that the person affected is powerless to control.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Thus, appellant's mutability complaint is necessarily addressed to the facts.  As such, it is belied by the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In deciding this issue, the jury had before it credible evidence that metabolic dysfunction, which leads to weight gain in the morbidly obese, lingers even after weight loss.  Given this evidence, the jury reasonably could have found that, though people afflicted with morbid obesity can treat the manifestations of metabolic dysfunction by fasting or perennial undereating, the physical impairment itself--a dysfunctional metabolism--is permanent.  Cf. Gilbert v. Frank, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572427\"><a href=\"/opinion/572427/leroy-gilbert-v-anthony-m-frank-in-his-capacity-as-postmaster-general-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">949</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">637</span></a></span>, 641 (2d Cir.1991) (finding that kidney disease controllable by weekly dialysis constitutes a handicap under Sec. 504 of the Rehabilitation Act);  Reynolds v. Brock, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"485713\"><a href=\"/opinion/485713/barbara-l-reynolds-esq-v-william-e-brock-secretary-of-labor-bart/\"><span class=\"volume\">815</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">571</span></a></span>, 573 (9th Cir.1987) (holding that epilepsy controllable by medication qualifies as a handicap under Sec. 504).  Hence, the jury's resolution of the mutability question rested on a sufficiently sturdy evidentiary platform.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is, moreover, another dissonant chord in appellant's paean to mutability.  Even if immutability were normally a prerequisite to finding a covered impairment, as the district court's charge suggested, the logic of a perceived disability case, as embodied in the regulations, see 45 C.F.R. Sec. 84.3(j)(2)(iv)(C), would nonetheless defeat the doctrine's application.  So long as the prospective employer responds to a perceived disability in a way that makes clear that the employer regards the condition as immutable, no more is exigible.  So it is here:  based on Dr. O'Brien's testimony, the jury reasonably could have inferred that he regarded plaintiff's morbid obesity as an \"impairment of a continuing nature,\" Evans v. City of Dallas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"514598\"><a href=\"/opinion/514598/robert-r-evans-cross-appellee-v-city-of-dallas-cross-appellant/\"><span class=\"volume\">861</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">846</span></a></span>, 853 (5th Cir.1988) (citation omitted), and that he rejected her application on that basis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Voluntariness.   Appellant's second assault regains no ground.  MHRH asseverates that, because morbid obesity is caused, or at least exacerbated, by voluntary conduct, it cannot constitute an impairment falling within the ambit of section 504.  But, this asseveration rests on a legally faulty premise.  The Rehabilitation Act contains no language suggesting that its protection is linked to how an individual became impaired, or whether an individual contributed to his or her impairment.  On the contrary, the Act indisputably applies to numerous conditions that may be caused or exacerbated by voluntary conduct, such as alcoholism, AIDS, diabetes, cancer resulting from cigarette smoking, heart disease resulting from excesses of various types, and the like.

See 45 C.F.R. Sec. 84.3(j)(2)(iv).  We bifurcate this phase of our itinerary, examining the inquiry's two components in reverse order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Major Life Activities.   The regulations implementing section 504 define \"major life activities\" to include walking, breathing, working, and other manual tasks.  See id. Sec. 84.3(j)(2)(ii).  In this case, Dr. O'Brien testified that he refused to hire plaintiff because he believed that her morbid obesity interfered with her ability to undertake physical activities, including walking, lifting, bending, stooping, and kneeling, to such an extent that she would be incapable of working as an IA-MR.  On this basis alone, the jury plausibly could have found that MHRH viewed plaintiff's suspected impairment as interfering with major life activities.  See, e.g., Perez v. Philadelphia Housing Auth., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1615931\"><a href=\"/opinion/1615931/perez-v-philadelphia-housing-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">677</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">357</span></a></span>, 360-61 (E.D.Pa.1987) (finding that abilities to walk, sit, and stand constitute major life activities), aff'd, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">841</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1120</span></span> (3d Cir.1988) (table).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Substantiality of Limiting Effect.   The court below instructed the jury that it must decide whether appellant treated plaintiff as if her condition \"substantially limited\" one of her major life activities.  Appellant did not object to the district court's decision to refrain from further definition of the key phrase, and, absent a contemporaneous objection, a trial court ordinarily may charge in the language of a statute or regulation without further elaboration.  See United States v. De La Cruz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"540778\"><a href=\"/opinion/540778/united-states-v-jose-manuel-de-la-cruz-aka-jose-manuel-linares-de-la/\"><span class=\"volume\">902</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">121</span></a></span>, 123 (1st Cir.1990).  Thus, we reject out of hand appellant's insinuations that the lower court erred in neglecting to afford a more precise definition sua sponte.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Proceeding to the merits, we think that the degree of limitation fell squarely to the jury and that the evidence warrants its finding that appellant regarded plaintiff as substantially impaired.  By his own admission, Dr. O'Brien believed plaintiff's limitations foreclosed a broad range of employment options in the health care industry, including positions such as community living aide, nursing home aide, hospital aide, and home health care aide.  Detached jurors reasonably could have found that this pessimistic assessment of plaintiff's capabilities demonstrated that appellant regarded Cook's condition as substantially limiting a major life activity--being able to work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant urges that, in order to draw such a conclusion, the jury would have had to engage in rank conjecture because plaintiff applied for, and was rejected from, only one job.  In effect, appellant's argument on this point reduces to the notion that meeting the statutory test requires, as a preliminary matter, that an individual unsuccessfully seek a myriad of jobs.  We cannot accept that notion for several reasons.  First, such a requirement is contrary to the plain reading of the statute and regulations.  Under the \"regarded as\" prong of section 504, a plaintiff can make out a cognizable perceived disability claim by demonstrating that she was treated as if she had an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity.  See 45 C.F.R. Sec. 84.3(j)(2)(iv)(C).  The Rehabilitation Act simply does not condition such claims on either the quantum of a plaintiff's application efforts or on her prospects of finding other employment.  By way of illustration, suit can be brought against a warehouse operator who refuses to hire all turquoise-eyed applicants solely because he believes that people with such coloring are universally incapable of lifting large crates, notwithstanding that other warehousemen might hire the applicants--or that the recalcitrant firm itself might hire them for other, more sedentary posts.  And placing claims in this perspective makes good sense.  The Rehabilitation Act seeks not only to aid the disabled, but also to \"eliminate discrimination on the basis of handicap.\"  45 C.F.R. Sec. 84.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Then, too, conditioning fulfillment of the \"substantially limits\" test on multiple rejections would be tantamount to saying that the law venerates the performance of obviously futile acts--a proposition we consistently have refused to espouse.  See, e.g., Northern Heel Corp. v. Compo Indus., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"508714\"><a href=\"/opinion/508714/northern-heel-corp-v-compo-industries-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">851</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">456</span></a></span>, 461 (1st Cir.1988) (stating that \"[t]he law should not be construed idly to require parties to perform futile acts or to engage in empty rituals);  see also Gilbert v. City of Cambridge, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"560456\"><a href=\"/opinion/560456/howard-h-gilbert-jr-v-city-of-cambridge/\"><span class=\"volume\">932</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span>, 60 (1st Cir.)

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">153</span></span> (1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it follows that each case must be determined on its own facts.  It also follows that an applicant need not subject herself to a lengthy series of rejections at the hands of an insensitive employer to establish that the employer views her limitations as substantial.  If the rationale proffered by an employer in the context of a single refusal to hire adequately evinces that the employer treats a particular condition as a disqualifier for a wide range of employment opportunities, proof of a far-flung pattern of rejections may not be necessary.  Put in slightly more concrete terms, denying an applicant even a single job that requires no unique physical skills, due solely to the perception that the applicant suffers from a physical limitations that would keep her from qualifying for a broad spectrum of jobs, can constitute treating an applicant as if her condition substantially limited a major life activity, viz., working.  This is such a case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The precedents cited by appellant are not to the contrary.  In each of them the court concluded that failure to qualify for a job possessing unique qualifications did not constitute a substantial limitation of a major life activity.  See, e.g., Welsh v. City of Tulsa, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593269\"><a href=\"/opinion/593269/harmon-e-welsh-v-city-of-tulsa-oklahoma-a-municipal-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1415</span></a></span>, 1417-18 (10th Cir.1992) (upholding termination as a fire fighter due to minor sensory loss in one hand);  Daley v. Koch, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"534193\"><a href=\"/opinion/534193/timothy-j-daley-v-edward-i-koch-mayor-of-the-city-of-new-york-benjamin/\"><span class=\"volume\">892</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">212</span></a></span>, 214-16 (2d Cir.1989) (sustaining rejection as police officer because of personality traits of poor judgment and irresponsibility);  Tudyman v.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">739</span></a></span>, 746 (C.D.Cal.1984) (sustaining termination as airline steward due to bodybuilder's bulk).  These positions are a far cry from the IA-MR post that Cook coveted.  We think there is a significant legal distinction between rejection based on a job-specific perception that the applicant is unable to excel at a narrow trade and a rejection based on more generalized perception that the applicant is impaired in such a way as would bar her from a large class of jobs.  Cf. Welsh, 977 F.2d at 1419 (noting that factors relevant to determining whether an impairment is substantially limiting include \"(1) the number and type of jobs from which the impaired individual is disqualified, (2) the geographical area to which the individual has reasonable access, and (3) the individual's job expectations and training\") (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the jury rationally could have concluded that MHRH's perception of what it thought to be plaintiff's impairment, as exhibited in its refusal to hire her for the IA-MR position, foreclosed a sufficiently wide range of jobs to serve as proof of a substantial limitation.  Accordingly, the district court appropriately refused to direct a verdict for the employer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next stop on our odyssey requires us to consider whether there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that plaintiff was \"otherwise qualified\" to work as an IA-MR.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">980</span></a></span> (1979).  Although an employer is not required to be unfailingly correct in assessing a person's qualifications for a job, see Bento v. I.T.O. Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1897604\"><a href=\"/opinion/1897604/bento-v-ito-corp-of-rhode-island/\"><span class=\"volume\">599</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">731</span></a></span>, 744-45 (D.R.I.1984), an employer cannot act solely on the basis of subjective beliefs.  An unfounded assumption that an applicant is unqualified for a particular job, even if arrived at in good faith, is not sufficient to forestall liability under section 504.  See Pushkin v. Regents of Univ. of Colo., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"393991\"><a href=\"/opinion/393991/joshua-r-pushkin-m-d-v-the-regents-of-the-university-of-colorado-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">658</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1372</span></a></span> (10th Cir.1981) (rejecting good faith as a defense under Sec. 504 because \"[d]iscrimination on the basis of handicap usually ... occurs under the guise of extending a helping hand or a mistaken, restrictive belief as to the limitations of handicapped persons\");  see also Carter v.

The employer's belief must be objectively reasonable.  It cannot rest on stereotypes and broad generalizations.  After all, \"mere possession of a handicap is not a permissible ground for assuming an inability to function in a particular context.\"  Davis, 442 U.S. at 405, 99 S.Ct. at 2366 (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's position, insofar as we can understand it, is that plaintiff's morbid obesity presented such a risk to herself and the Ladd Center's residents that she was not otherwise qualified, or, in the alternative, that it was reasonable for appellant to believe that she was not otherwise qualified.  This protestation is undone by three independent considerations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, because appellant's evidence on this point serves, at most, to generate a fact question as to whether plaintiff was otherwise qualified, the responsibility for resolving this dispute properly fell to the jury.  See School Bd. of Nassau County v. Arline, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111832\"><a href=\"/opinion/111832/school-bd-of-nassau-cty-v-arline/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">273</span></a></span>, 287, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111832\"><a href=\"/opinion/111832/school-bd-of-nassau-cty-v-arline/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1123</span></a></span>, 1128, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111832\"><a href=\"/opinion/111832/school-bd-of-nassau-cty-v-arline/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">307</span></a></span> (1987).  The jury found specially that appellant did not reasonably believe that plaintiff lacked the requisite qualifications.  See supra note 3.  Having carefully scrutinized the record, we see no principled way in which we can scuttle this finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, we question whether appellant has put forward evidence sufficient to beget a factual question.  At trial, MHRH failed to make specific inquiries into plaintiff's physical abilities and instead relied on generalizations regarding an obese person's capabilities.  This is the strict inverse of the \"fact-specific and individualized\" inquiry, Arline, 480 U.S. at 287, that the Rehabilitation Act requires.  Indeed, appellant's \"evidence\" comprises a graphic illustration of an employment decision based on stereotyping--exactly the sort of employment decision that the Rehabilitation Act seeks to banish.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, one of appellant's justifications for rejecting plaintiff--its concern over high absenteeism and increased workers' compensation costs--is itself a prohibited basis for denying employment.  Unless absenteeism rises to a level such that the applicant is no longer \"otherwise qualified,\" the Rehabilitation Act requires employers to bear absenteeism and other miscellaneous burdens involved in making reasonable accommodations in order to permit the employment of disabled persons.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will not paint the lily.  Several pieces of evidence loom large on this issue.  Plaintiff received a satisfactory report following the physical examination conducted by appellant's own nurse;  the IA-MR position for which she applied did not demand any elevated level of mobility, lifting ability, size, or stature;  plaintiff had satisfactorily performed all her duties and responsibilities as an IA-MR during her previous five years of employment;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  and MHRH acknowledged that those duties and responsibilities have not changed.  From this, and other, evidence, we believe that the jury lawfully could have found plaintiff, apart from any impairment, \"otherwise qualified\" to work as an IA-MR.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>E</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our last port of call requires that we determine whether the evidence justified a finding that MHRH turned down plaintiff's request for employment due solely to her morbid obesity.  This final piece of the puzzle is straightforward.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MHRH has not offered a hint of any non-weight-related reason for rejecting plaintiff's application.  Rather, it has consistently conceded that it gave plaintiff the cold shoulder because Dr. O'Brien denied her medical clearance.  The record is pellucid that Dr. O'Brien's refusal had three foci, each of which related directly to plaintiff's obesity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  On this record, there was considerable room for a jury to find that appellant declined to hire Cook \"due solely to\" her perceived handicap.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  In a society that all too often confuses \"slim\" with \"beautiful\" or \"good,\" morbid obesity can present formidable barriers to employment.  Where, as here, the barriers transgress federal law, those who erect and seek to preserve them must suffer the consequences.  In this case, the evidence adduced at trial amply supports the jury's determination that MHRH violated section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  And because MHRH refused to hire plaintiff due solely to her morbid obesity, there is no cause to disturb either the damage award or the equitable relief granted by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The medical profession considers a person morbidly obese if she weighs either more than twice her optimal weight or more than 100 pounds over her optimal weight.

Mutability is nowhere mentioned in the statute or regulations, and we see little reason to postulate it as an automatic disqualifier under section 504.  It seems to us, instead, that mutability is relevant only in determining the substantiality of the limitation flowing from a given impairment.  So viewed, mutability only precludes those conditions that an individual can easily and quickly reverse by behavioral alteration from coming within section 504.  But, in the absence of a contemporaneous objection, the charge became the law of the case;  and in any event, the district court's error is harmless, for it worked to appellant's advantage</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Indeed, Dr. Blackburn, appellant's expert witness, testified that it is dangerous for a dieter to lose more than 20% of her total body weight each year.  Applying this formula to Dr. O'Brien's acknowledgment that he would have rehired Cook only when she reduced her weight to 190 pounds, the jury could have concluded that appellant treated plaintiff as if her obesity would have disqualified her from working for over two years</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> We take no view of the correctness of the instruction.

Some guidance in interpreting this phrase can perhaps be gleaned by looking to the regulations implementing the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 12101 et seq.  (1993).  Those regulations indicate that the question of whether an impairment is substantially limiting turns on \"(1) the nature and severity of the impairment, (2) the duration or expected duration of the impairment, and (3) the [actual or expected] permanent or long term impact ... of, or resulting from, the impairment.\"  29 C.F.R. Sec. 1630, App. at 403 (1992)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> Implicit in the Rehabilitation Act's requirement that an employer who receives federal funds make reasonable accommodations to allow a disabled employee to perform her job is the concept that the employer must absorb some costs in working toward the goal of providing meaningful employment opportunities for disabled persons.  See, e.g., 45 C.F.R. Sec. 84.12 (requiring accommodations such as \"job restructuring,\" \"modified work schedules,\" \"acquisition or modification of equipment or devices,\" and the like).  Such accommodations are necessary unless the employer can \"demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship,\" which is determined, inter alia, by the \"nature and cost\" of the proposed accommodation.  Id., Sec. 84.12(b)(2);  see, e.g., Nelson v. Thornburgh, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1454509\"><a href=\"/opinion/1454509/nelson-v-thornburgh/\"><span class=\"volume\">567</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Dr. O'Brien testified that there were three reasons for his decision:  First, he believed that she herself was at risk based on her obesity;  second, he believed that she could put the retarded residents at risk in emergency situations;  third, he was concerned about the overall cost of Worker's Compensation injuries.\"</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
