José A. Fusté, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                        Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n                   Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                     and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Alexander H. Bopp, with whom Indiano & Williams, P.S.C. was on\nbrief for appellants.\n     Jorge J. López López, with whom Ramonita Dieppa González and\nOtero & López, L.L.P. were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           July 16, 2002\n\f           LIPEZ, Circuit Judge. This is an appeal from a no-\n\nliability jury verdict in a medical malpractice case.          Plaintiffs-\n\nappellants -- Lily LaPlace-Bayard, her husband Daniel Bayard, and\n\ntheir conjugal partnership (collectively \"plaintiffs\") -- brought\n\nthis diversity action in negligence against, inter alia, defendant-\n\nappellee, Dr. Francisco Batlle, alleging that Dr. Batlle breached\n\nthe duty of care owed to his patient LaPlace-Bayard when he failed\n\nto timely diagnose her condition and perform immediate remedial\n\nsurgery, causing her substantial injury.           After trial, the jury\n\nreturned a verdict for Dr. Batlle, and judgment was accordingly\nentered in his favor.        On appeal, plaintiffs seek a new trial on\n\nthe   grounds   that   the    trial   court   abused   its   discretion   by\n(1) excluding the testimony of one of their proposed medical\nexperts and (2) allowing Dr. Batlle to testify as an expert\n\nwitness.   Unpersuaded by plaintiffs' arguments, we affirm.\n\n                                      I.\n\n           In the summer of 1998, when LaPlace-Bayard and her then-\nfiance Daniel Bayard were residents of the U.S. Virgin Islands,\nLaPlace-Bayard was diagnosed with a cyst on one of her ovaries.\nUpon consultation with a gynecologist in Puerto Rico, LaPlace-\n\nBayard decided to undergo surgery to have the cyst removed.               The\n\nsurgery took place on August 6, 1998, at Auxilio Mutuo Hospital in\n\nPuerto Rico.    It is undisputed by the parties to this appeal that,\n\nduring surgery, the operating physician inadvertently perforated\n\nLaPlace-Bayard's colon in removing the cyst. That perforation went\n\nunnoticed, however, and LaPlace-Bayard was discharged from the\n\n                                      -2-\n\fhospital later that day.         Complaining of abdominal pain and fever,\n\nLaPlace-Bayard returned to the hospital on August 7, 1998, where\n\nshe was seen by, inter alia, an emergency room surgeon, Dr. Batlle,\nwho diagnosed her as suffering from \"acute abdomen,\" an intra-\n\nabdominal condition manifested by severe pain.               On August 8, 1998,\n\nDr. Batlle performed exploratory surgery on LaPlace-Bayard and,\nupon discovery, repaired the perforation in her colon.\n\n            Following      surgery,      Dr.     Batlle,    as      her     attending\n\nphysician, had primary responsibility for LaPlace-Bayard during her\n\npost-operative stay in the hospital.              Given the risk of infection\n\nassociated    with    colon     perforation     reparation,       Dr.     Batlle     put\n\nLaPlace-Bayard on a regimen of antibiotics and arranged for a\n\nconsultation with an infectious disease specialist.                        After her\ndischarge from the hospital on August 16, 1998, she returned to her\n\nresidence in St. Thomas. However, she continued to experience\n\nnausea, abdominal pain and difficulty breathing.                  As a result, on\nAugust 23, 1998, LaPlace-Bayard admitted herself into Palms West\n\nHospital in Florida, where she was treated for acute pancreatitis,\n\nsevere pleural effusion (fluid in the thoracic cavity), suppurative\n\nperitonitis       (infection    in    abdominal     cavity),      and     a   serious\n\nbacterial    infection.         She   was    discharged    from     Palms     West    on\n\nSeptember 1, 1998.\n\n             On   August   5,    1999,      plaintiffs    brought    this     medical\n\nmalpractice action against, inter alia, Auxilio Mutuo Hospital, Dr.\n\nBatlle, and several other physicians, alleging negligence in the\n\ncare and treatment of LaPlace-Bayard at Auxilio Mutuo Hospital in\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fAugust 1998.      Specifically with respect to Dr. Batlle (the only\n\ndefendant relevant to this appeal), plaintiffs claimed in their\n\npre-trial submission that Dr. Batlle, upon diagnosing LaPlace-\nBayard    with   \"acute   abdomen\"    on   August   7,   1998,   should   have\n\nimmediately diagnosed a perforated colon and performed remedial\n\nsurgery.    He failed to do so and instead waited over twelve hours\nbefore performing the surgery.1 That delay caused additional fecal\n\nmaterial    to    leak    into   LaPlace-Bayard's        abdominal   cavity,\n\nexacerbating the infection.          Plaintiffs alleged that Dr. Batlle\n\nthus breached his duty of care owed to LaPlace-Bayard under Puerto\n\nRico law, specifically 31 L.P.R.A. § 5141,2 and caused her severe\n\nphysical injury and emotional pain.          Dr. Batlle responded that he\n\nwas not negligent in his care and treatment of LaPlace-Bayard and\nthat LaPlace-Bayard was largely at fault for her damages because\n\nshe failed to follow the instructions provided by her physicians.\n\n            Over the course of the litigation, the parties engaged in\nsettlement discussions. By August 16, 2000, plaintiffs had reached\n\n\n     1\n       The parties disagree as to why Dr. Batlle did not perform\nsurgery sooner. LaPlace-Bayard claims that Dr. Batlle should have\nperformed surgery immediately on August 7, 1998, when he diagnosed\nher with \"acute abdomen.\" According to Dr. Batlle, however, he did\nin fact recommend surgery to LaPlace-Bayard on August 7, but she\ndid not consent to surgery until August 8.\n     2\n         Section 5141 provides:\n\n     A person who by an act or omission causes damage to\n     another through fault or negligence shall be obliged to\n     repair the damage so done. Concurrent imprudence of the\n     party aggrieved does not exempt from liability, but\n     entails a reduction of the indemnity.\n\n31 L.P.R.A. § 5141.\n\n                                     -4-\n\fa settlement3 with all of the defendants, except for Dr. Batlle.\nPreviously, in a scheduling order dated January 26, 2000, the court\n\nhad informed the parties that a pre-trial conference was to be held\non August 22, 2000, and directed them to file a Joint Proposed Pre-\n\ntrial Order in advance of that conference.           On August 18, 2000,\n\nplaintiffs informed the court that (1) a settlement had been\nreached with four of the five named defendants; (2) they were\n\nhopeful that a Joint Proposed Pre-Trial Order would not have to be\n\nfiled in this case because a settlement with Dr. Batlle, the sole\n\nremaining defendant in the case, seemed imminent; and (3) in the\n\nevent a settlement was not reached with Dr. Batlle by August 21,\n\n2000, the proposed pre-trial order would be submitted at that\n\npoint.\n            On   August   22,   2000,    the   pre-trial   conference   was\n\ncancelled because of Hurricane Debby.           On August 23, 2000, Dr.\n\nBatlle sent a letter to plaintiffs categorically rejecting any\nsettlement demand.    The next day, plaintiffs filed (1) a motion to\n\nreschedule a pre-trial/settlement conference and (2) given defense\n\ncounsel's unwillingness to participate in a joint submission, a\n\nunilateral proposed pre-trial order, listing Dr. Vilaire Bayard,\n\nJr., M.D.,4 a Massachusetts-based surgeon, as their only expert\nwitness.    Dr. Batlle did not list any expert witnesses in his pre-\n\ntrial submission.\n\n\n\n     3\n         That settlement was finalized on August 24, 2000.\n     4\n         Dr. Bayard and Daniel Bayard are second cousins.\n\n                                   -5-\n\f           On October 16, 2000, the court held a status conference.\n\nPlaintiffs informed the court that settlement efforts with Dr.\n\nBatlle had been unsuccessful to date, but that they were not\nprepared for trial.       Nevertheless, the district court issued an\n\norder which provided:\n\n           This case has been settled as to all\n           defendants except Dr. Francisco Batlle-Batlle.\n           The demand against this physician is $20,000.\n           The court strongly recommends that the case be\n           settled in that amount . . . .     10 days to\n           report. Trial shall be held Nov. 2, [20]00,\n           9:30 A.M.\n\nAccordingly, plaintiffs gave Dr. Batlle until October 25, 2000, to\n\naccept the settlement demand.               On that date, Dr. Batlle again\n\nflatly rejected the settlement demand, setting in motion a flurry\n\nof trial preparation activity, including the following:                        (1) on\nOctober   26,    plaintiffs     filed       an   emergency      motion    to   take   a\n\nvideotaped      deposition    of    Dr.     Bayard     and    to    substitute   that\n\ndeposition for his live testimony, due to his unavailability to\nappear    at    trial;   that      motion       was   granted      over   defendant's\n\nobjection, and the deposition was taken on October 31 in Worcester,\n\nMassachusetts; (2) also on October 26, plaintiffs notified the\n\ncourt of their intention to name an additional medical expert\n\nwitness, Dr. Claudia Lorenzo Pérez, M.D. (Dr. Lorenzo) and the next\n\nday filed a motion to supplement their proposed pre-trial order to\n\ninclude Dr. Lorenzo as an expert witness.                    In opposition to that\n\nmotion, Dr. Batlle filed an in limine motion to bar Dr. Lorenzo\n\nfrom testifying at trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\f             The trial commenced on November 2, 2000.         At trial, Dr.\n\nBayard, via his October 31 videotaped deposition, provided expert\n\ntestimony on behalf of plaintiffs on the applicable duty of care\n\nowed by Dr. Batlle to LaPlace-Bayard.             Upon the close of Dr.\n\nBayard's testimony, the court, granting Dr. Batlle's in limine\n\nmotion, barred Dr. Lorenzo from testifying as an expert witness in\n\nplaintiffs' case. In defendant's case, Dr. Batlle testified on his\n\nown behalf but presented no independent medical expert testimony.\n\nThe   jury   returned   a   no-liability    verdict   for   Dr.   Batlle   and\n\njudgment was entered accordingly.          This appeal ensued.\n\n                                   II.\n\n             Plaintiffs raise two issues on appeal as grounds for a\nnew trial.     First, they argue that the court improperly excluded\n\ntestimony of Dr. Lorenzo, one of their two proposed medical expert\nwitnesses.     Second, they claim that Dr. Batlle testified as an\nexpert witness and should not have been allowed to do so.\n\nA.    Exclusion of Dr. Lorenzo's Medical Expert Testimony\n\n             The court explained its decision to exclude Dr. Lorenzo's\n\ntestimony as follows:\n\n             I have read the doctor's report, and I have a\n             serious concern about the fact that this case\n             has been on the docket for quite a while. And\n             the truth of the matter is that everybody left\n             expert retaining and preparation for the very\n             last minute.   Perhaps everybody thought the\n             case would settle.    I'm not trying to find\n             fault here, but the truth of the matter is\n             that since October 16th it was quite evident\n             that this case could be tried, especially when\n             it did not settle as to one of the co-\n             defendants. And I find it a bit difficult to\n\n                                    -7-\n\f            accept that somebody who is retained in the\n            middle of taking Dr. Bayard's deposition on\n            October 30th and October 31st is going to\n            testify now and has not been consulted before.\n            And I think it's quite cumulative, also. And\n            I have read [Dr. Lorenzo's] report, and I\n            don't see anything there that [Dr. Bayard] has\n            not covered.\nThere are two grounds for the exclusion of Dr. Lorenzo's testimony\n\napparent from this ruling: (1) plaintiffs failed to timely announce\n\ntheir intention to use Dr. Lorenzo as an expert witness, and\n\n(2) Dr. Lorenzo's anticipated testimony (as evidenced from her\n\nexpert    report)   would   be   cumulative   of   Dr.   Bayard's   expert\n\ntestimony, already admitted into evidence by videotape deposition.\n\nWe examine each rationale in turn.\n            1.   Untimely Disclosure\n\n            The court's exclusion of Dr. Lorenzo's testimony on the\n\nground of untimely disclosure is a discovery sanction under Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 37(c)5 for a violation of the mandatory discovery rules\n\n\n\n\n     5\n         Rule 37(c) provides in relevant part:\n\n     A party that without substantial justification fails to\n     disclose information required by Rule 26(a) or 26(e)(1),\n     or to amend a prior response to discovery as required by\n     Rule 26(e)(2), is not, unless such failure is harmless,\n     permitted to use as evidence at a trial, at a hearing, or\n     on a motion any witness or information not so disclosed.\n     In addition to or in lieu of this sanction, the court, on\n     motion and after affording an opportunity to be heard,\n     may impose other appropriate sanctions. In addition to\n     requiring payment of reasonable expenses, including\n     attorney's fees, caused by the failure, these sanctions\n     may include any of the actions authorized under Rule\n     37(b)(2)(A), (B), and (C) and may include informing the\n     jury of the failure to make the disclosure.\nFed. R. Civ. P. 37(c).\n\n                                   -8-\n\funder Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2).6            We review that ruling under an\n\nabuse of discretion standard.         See Thibeault v. Square D Co., 960\n\nF.2d 239, 243 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"In reviewing a trial court's\nsanction order concerning a discovery-related matter, an abuse-of-\n\ndiscretion standard controls.\").\n\n            Rule 26(a)(2) mandates the timely disclosure of the\nidentity    of   expert   witnesses    as    well   as    expert   reports   in\n\naccordance with the directions of the trial court.                  Here, the\n\ndistrict court, in its January 26, 2000, scheduling order, directed\n\nthe parties to identify their expert witnesses and summarize each\n\nexpert witness's qualifications in a joint proposed pre-trial order\n\nto be filed no later than August 18, 2000.               In their August pre-\n\ntrial memorandum, however, plaintiffs listed Dr. Bayard as their\nonly expert witness.      It was not until October 26, 2000, barely a\n\nweek before trial, that plaintiffs disclosed their intention to use\n\n\n\n\n     6\n         Rule 26(a)(2) provides in relevant part:\n\n     [A] party shall disclose to other parties the identity of\n     any person who may be used at trial to present evidence\n     under Rules 702, 703, or 705 of the Federal Rules of\n     Evidence. . . . [T]his disclosure shall, with respect to\n     a witness who is retained or specially employed to\n     provide expert testimony in the case or whose duties as\n     an employee of the party regularly involve giving expert\n     testimony, be accompanied by a written report prepared\n     and signed by the witness. . . . These disclosures shall\n     be made at the times and in the sequence directed by the\n     court. In the absence of other directions from the court\n     or stipulation by the parties, the disclosures shall be\n     made at least 90 days before the trial date or the date\n     the case is to be ready for trial . . . .\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2).\n\n                                      -9-\n\fDr. Lorenzo as an expert witness.7          Until then, Dr. Batlle had no\n\nnotice of plaintiffs' intention to retain another medical expert\n\nwitness. Dr. Lorenzo's expert report and curriculum vitae were not\nprovided to Dr. Batlle until the night of October 30, 2000, a mere\n\nthree days before trial.\n\n          Plaintiffs argue that their failure to comply with the\ndiscovery rules in a more timely manner was justified by the\n\n\"unusual\" circumstances of the case, described as the likelihood of\n\nsettlement with all of the defendants. Given that likelihood, they\n\nopted not to retain Dr. Lorenzo earlier in the litigation in an\n\neffort to keep costs down, thus maximizing the possibility of\n\nsettlement.       Only on October 25 when Dr. Batlle unequivocally\n\nrejected the $20,000 settlement demand did they retain Dr. Lorenzo\nas an expert and expedite the production of expert reports.\n\n          That justification, however, is woefully inadequate to\n\nexcuse plaintiffs' tardy disclosures.           Litigants routinely engage\nin settlement negotiations until the eve of trial and beyond. That\n\nreality does not excuse them from responding to interrogatories and\n\nretaining experts and disclosing them and their reports to opposing\n\ncounsel in    a    timely   manner   pursuant    to   the   discovery   rules.\n\nPlaintiffs simply chose to postpone the costs associated with\n\nretaining an expert in an attempt to increase, in their view, the\n\nlikelihood of settlement.      In doing so, they assumed the risk that\n\ntheir delayed trial preparation would compromise their ability to\n\n\n     7\n       On October 27, 2000, plaintiffs moved to supplement their\npre-trial order to add Dr. Lorenzo as a second expert witness.\n\n                                     -10-\n\fput on their best case.       To excuse their belated disclosures now\n\nwould relieve them of the consequences of the risk they assumed.\n\n             Furthermore, we have recognized that \"[i]n the arena of\nexpert discovery -- a setting which often involves complex factual\n\ninquiries -- Rule 26 increases the quality of trials by better\n\npreparing attorneys for cross-examination.\" Id. at 244. We cannot\n\nignore the real danger that, if Dr. Lorenzo had been allowed to\n\ntestify, plaintiffs' belated disclosures would have undermined\n\ndefense counsel's ability to cross-examine her.          See id. at 246-47\n\n(\"Many courts     --   this   court   included   --   have   recognized   the\n\nintroduction of new expert testimony on the eve of trial can be\n\nseriously prejudicial to the opposing party.\").\n\n             As noted above, district courts have broad discretion in\nmeting out Rule 37(c) sanctions for Rule 26 violations. See Ortiz-\n\nLopez v. Sociedad Espanola de Auxilio Mutuo Y Beneficiencia de\n\nPuerto Rico, 248 F.3d 29, 34 (1st Cir. 2001).                These sanctions\nrange from limited exclusion to dismissal of the case entirely.\n\nSee id.    \"[E]xclusion of evidence is a standard sanction for a\n\nviolation of the duty of disclosure under Rule 26(a).\"            Samos Imex\n\nCorp. v. Nextel Communications, Inc., 194 F.3d 301, 305 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).    Given the facts in this case, we could hardly say that the\n\ndistrict court exceeded its discretion in excluding Dr. Lorenzo's\n\ntestimony.\n\n            2. Cumulativeness\n\n            For the sake of completeness, and to dispel any notion of\n\nplaintiffs that the exclusionary ruling of the trial court was\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fsomehow unfair to them, we evaluate the court's second ground for\n\nexcluding Dr. Lorenzo's testimony, namely, that it would have been\n\ncumulative under Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence in light\nof the testimony of Dr. Bayard, plaintiffs' other medical expert.\n\n          Plaintiffs insist that the court did not understand the\n\nfull scope of their case.   They claim that their case against Dr.\nBatlle was premised upon two discrete negligence theories of\n\nliability to be addressed separately by each expert.   Dr. Bayard,\n\ntrained as a surgeon, testified only as to Dr. Batlle's negligence\n\nin his capacity as LaPlace-Bayard's surgeon.    Dr. Lorenzo -- an\n\nalleged expert on matters of risk management and the administration\n\nof health institutions -- would have testified as to the negligence\n\nof Dr. Batlle in his role as LaPlace-Bayard's attending physician\nand in managing the post-operative risks associated with her\n\ncondition. Thus, having retained two separate experts to serve two\n\ndistinct purposes, plaintiffs maintain that Dr. Lorenzo's testimony\nwould have differed dramatically from that of Dr. Bayard.\n\n          Plaintiffs overstate the pre-trial clarity of their two\n\ndiscrete theories of Dr. Batlle's liability.    In their pre-trial\n\nsubmission, they articulated only one theory of liability to the\n\ntrial court -- namely, that Dr. Batlle was negligent in his role as\n\nLaPlace-Bayard's surgeon:\n\n          Dr. Batlle noted acute abdominal pain and high\n          fever.   Dr. Batlle should have immediately\n          diagnosed a punctured colon and performed\n          immediate remedial surgery.    As a result of\n          Dr. Batlle's failure to timely diagnose\n          [LaPlace-Bayard's] punctured colon and his\n          failure to timely perform corrective surgery,\n          she   suffered   permanent   and   irreparable\n\n                               -12-\n\f            physical injuries, and continues to suffer\n            both substantial emotional and physical pain.\n(emphasis      added).       In    that    submission,     plaintiffs      further\n\ncharacterized the ultimate facts in dispute as \"the extent of the\n\ndamage caused by the delay in performing corrective surgery after\n\n[LaPlace-Bayard] presented herself at the emergency room with acute\n\nabdominal pain.\"           (emphasis added).           There is no mention in\n\nplaintiffs' pre-trial memorandum that their theory of the case\n\nincluded Dr. Batlle's negligence in LaPlace-Bayard's post-operative\n\ncare, including managing the risks associated with her post-\n\noperative condition. In the absence of such timely representations\n\nto the court below, we doubt that plaintiffs could rely on that\nbroader theory of liability now to win a new trial.               See Thibeault,\n\n960 F.2d at 247 (noting potential for prejudice to opposing counsel\n\nin \"an eleventh-hour change in a party's theory of the case\").\n            We need not decide that issue, however, because Dr.\n\nBayard   did     present    testimony      on    Dr.   Batlle's   post-operative\n\nnegligence,      as   plaintiffs    said    he    would.    Contrary      to   their\n\nposition on appeal, plaintiffs explicitly stated in an October 26,\n2000,    court    submission      that    \"Dr.    Bayard   will   serve    as    the\n\nPlaintiffs' expert on surgery and the quality of aftercare rendered\n\npost-operatively by Dr. Battle [sic].\"                  Similarly, plaintiffs'\n\ncounsel explicitly stated at Dr. Bayard's October 31 deposition his\n\nintention to use Dr. Bayard both \"as an expert in this trial with\n\nrespect to the surgical procedures, and the quality of after-care\n\nthat was rendered by the surgeon, Dr. Francisco Batlle.\"                         The\n\nrecord indicates that Dr. Bayard did in fact provide expert opinion\n\n                                         -13-\n\ftestimony on both the August 8 surgery as well as the quality of\n\nafter-care       provided   by    Dr.    Batlle      in   his   role    as    attending\n\nphysician.\n             With respect to the surgery, Dr. Bayard testified that,\n\nwhen   a    patient     presents    with       acute      abdomen     after    recently\n\nundergoing surgery to remove an ovarian cyst, a physician should\nsuspect a perforated bowel and should perform surgery immediately.\n\nHe testified that there was no medical justification for Dr.\n\nBatlle's    waiting      twelve    hours       to   perform     the    surgery.      His\n\ntestimony, however, did not end there.                    Dr. Bayard proceeded to\n\ntestify as to (1) the diagnostic lab tests that should have been\n\nperformed on LaPlace-Bayard in the days following the August 8\n\nsurgery; (2) his opinion on the range of antibiotics Dr. Batlle\nadministered to LaPlace-Bayard after surgery; and (3) his opinion\n\nthat Dr. Batlle should have taken a culture of the infection\n\nobserved during surgery in order to know what antibiotics to\nadminister.       He testified that LaPlace-Bayard should not have been\n\ndischarged from the hospital on August 16, 1998, because it was\n\nlikely     she    was   suffering       from    acute     pancreatitis        and   other\n\nconditions at that time.          In light of Dr. Bayard's testimony as to\n\nLaPlace-Bayard's post-operative care, we can hardly find fault with\n\nthe district court's finding that Dr. Lorenzo's proffered testimony\n\nwould have been cumulative evidence.\n\n             In    a    further    effort      to    distinguish       Dr.    Lorenzo's\n\ntestimony from that of Dr. Bayard, plaintiffs argue that Dr.\n\nBayard's credibility may have been diminished because (1) he was\n\n\n                                         -14-\n\fplaintiff Daniel Bayard's second cousin, and (2) Dr. Bayard, unable\n\nto read Spanish, was limited in his review of the medical file to\n\nthose records that were in English.              Thus, plaintiffs argue, the\ntestimony of Dr. Lorenzo (who was fluent in Spanish and thus able\n\nto   review    the    entire   medical   file)    would    have   bolstered    the\n\nstrength of their case.          Again, plaintiffs seek relief from the\nconsequences of their own decisions.         Plaintiffs chose to disclose\n\nin their pre-trial submission only one medical expert witness,\n\nknowing   of    his    inability   to    understand       Spanish   and   of   his\n\nrelationship to Daniel Bayard.           Moreover, plaintiffs could have\n\nprovided Dr. Bayard with an English translation of the Spanish\n\nportions of the medical record.          They chose not to do so.         Having\n\nmade these decisions, they cannot complain now of the consequences.\n              Finally, plaintiffs claim that even if the exclusion of\n\nDr. Lorenzo's testimony was otherwise warranted, the timing of the\n\ncourt's ruling irreparably prejudiced them.               They point out that,\nalthough Dr. Batlle had filed his motion to exclude Dr. Lorenzo's\n\ntestimony before trial had commenced, it was not until after the\n\ncourt heard Dr. Bayard's videotaped deposition testimony that it\n\nannounced its decision to exclude Dr. Lorenzo's testimony. At that\n\npoint, however, plaintiffs had already told the jury in their\n\nopening statement that it would hear testimony from \"experts\" in\n\nthe plural.     They now claim that the court's ruling prevented them\n\nfrom keeping their promise of introducing testimony from more than\n\none expert, thus undermining their credibility with the jury.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\f              At the time that plaintiffs gave their opening statement,\n\nthey knew that the court had not yet ruled on Dr. Batlle's motion\n\nto exclude Dr. Lorenzo's testimony.            Well aware of that pending in\nlimine motion, plaintiffs proceeded at their peril in promising the\n\njury testimony from more than one expert. Having made that choice,\n\nplaintiffs      cannot    expect    once    again    to   be     relieved    of     the\nconsequences of their own judgment call.\n\nB.   Admission of Dr. Batlle's Testimony\n\n              In considering plaintiffs' second ground for appeal, we\n\nnote at the outset that the court never characterized Dr. Batlle as\nan   expert    witness,    stating    instead      that   Dr.    Batlle     would   be\n\n\"treated      as   the    surgeon     who   operated       on\"    LaPlace-Bayard.\nNevertheless,      plaintiffs       argue   that    Dr.    Batlle    gave     expert\ntestimony at trial and should not have been allowed to do so\n\nwithout       providing    an      expert     report      and     disclosing        his\nqualifications as required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(B).8\n              Despite    these   general    averments,      plaintiffs       fail    to\n\nidentify which particular statements of Dr. Batlle should have been\nexcluded.      Nor did they raise at trial any specific objections\n(save one as to relevancy) during the course of Dr. Batlle's direct\n\nexamination. Having carefully examined the trial transcript of Dr.\nBatlle's direct testimony ourselves, we cannot identify a colorable\nbasis for plaintiffs' claim of error.\n\n\n\n\n      8\n          See supra note 5.\n\n                                       -16-\n\f             In his direct examination, Dr. Batlle methodically took\n\nthe jury through a day-by-day account of his actions and decisions\n\nrelating to the care and treatment of LaPlace-Bayard at Auxilio\nMutuo Hospital from August 7, 1998, through her discharge on August\n\n16, 1998.        He was never asked on direct to render opinions\n\nregarding treatment by other physicians or other institutions. Dr.\nBatlle only offered opinions beyond the scope of his own treatment\n\nof LaPlace-Bayard in response to plaintiffs' own questions on\n\ncross-examination as to the treatment given to LaPlace-Bayard at\n\nPalms     West   Hospital   after   her   discharge   from   Auxilio   Mutuo\n\nHospital.9       Having opened the door to that testimony, plaintiffs\n\ncannot now be heard to complain about the court's admission of such\n\ntestimony.10      See McDonald v. Federal Laboratories, Inc., 724 F.2d\n\n243, 248 (1st Cir. 1984) (rejecting claim of error in admission of\n\nexpert    testimony    where   challenged    testimony   was   elicited   by\n\nappellant's counsel); see also Aetna Casualty & Surety Co. v.\n\nTryniecki, 293 F.2d 289, 290-91 (5th Cir. 1961) (similar result);\n\n11 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary Kay Kane, Federal\n\n\n     9\n       In fact, defense counsel specifically objected to that line\nof questioning as being outside the scope of direct examination.\nThose objections were overruled.\n     10\n       In a corollary argument, plaintiffs maintain that the court\nabused its discretion when it failed to instruct the jury that Dr.\nBatlle was not testifying as an expert.      We disagree. The jury\nheard plaintiffs' counsel explicitly state his intention to use Dr.\nBayard as an expert witness. In contrast, neither the court nor\ndefense counsel ever told the jury that Dr. Batlle would be\ntestifying as an expert on his own behalf. Moreover, the jury knew\nthat Dr. Batlle was the defendant.     Thus, there was no need to\ninstruct the jury that Dr. Batlle was not an expert witness in this\ncase.\n\n                                    -17-\n\fPractice and Procedure § 2885 at 463 n. 14 (2d ed. 1995) (citing\n\ncases where court refused to notice any alleged error where such\n\nerror was invited by complaining party).\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -18-\n\f",

Plaintiffs-appellants &#8212; Lily LaPlace-Bayard, her husband Daniel Bayard, and their conjugal partnership (collectively \"plaintiffs\") &#8212; brought this diversity action in negligence against, <i>inter alia,</i> defendant-appellee, Dr. Francisco Batlle, alleging that Dr. Batlle breached the duty of care owed to his patient LaPlace-Bayard when he failed to timely diagnose her condition and perform immediate remedial surgery, causing her substantial injury. After trial, the jury returned a verdict for Dr. Batlle, and judgment was accordingly entered in his favor. On appeal, plaintiffs seek a new trial on the grounds that the trial court abused its discretion by (1) excluding the testimony of one of their proposed medical experts and (2) allowing Dr. Batlle to testify as an expert witness. Unpersuaded by plaintiffs' arguments, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the summer of 1998, when LaPlace-Bayard and her then-fiance Daniel Bayard were residents of the U.S. Virgin Islands, LaPlace-Bayard was diagnosed with a cyst on one of her ovaries. Upon consultation with a gynecologist in Puerto Rico, LaPlace-Bayard decided to undergo surgery to have the cyst removed. The surgery took place on August 6, 1998, at Auxilio Mutuo Hospital in Puerto Rico. It is undisputed by the parties to this appeal that, during surgery, the operating physician inadvertently perforated LaPlace-Bayard's colon in removing the cyst. That perforation went unnoticed, however, and LaPlace-Bayard was discharged from the hospital later that day. Complaining of abdominal pain and fever, LaPlace-Bayard returned to the hospital on August 7, 1998, where she was seen by, <i>inter alia,</i> an emergency room surgeon, Dr. Batlle, who diagnosed her as suffering from \"acute abdomen,\" an intra-abdominal condition manifested by severe pain. On August 8, 1998, Dr. Batlle performed exploratory surgery on LaPlace-Bayard and, upon discovery, repaired the perforation in her colon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following surgery, Dr. Batlle, as her attending physician, had primary responsibility for LaPlace-Bayard during her post-operative stay in the hospital. Given the risk of infection associated with colon perforation reparation, Dr. Batlle put LaPlace-Bayard on a regimen of antibiotics and arranged for a consultation with an infectious disease specialist. After her discharge from the hospital on August 16, 1998, she returned to her residence in St. Thomas. However, she continued to experience nausea, abdominal pain and difficulty breathing. As a result, on August 23, 1998, LaPlace-Bayard admitted herself into Palms West Hospital in Florida, where she was treated for acute pancreatitis, severe pleural effusion (fluid in the thoracic cavity), suppurative peritonitis (infection in abdominal cavity), and a serious bacterial infection. She was discharged from Palms West on September 1, 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 5, 1999, plaintiffs brought this medical malpractice action against, <i>inter alia,</i> Auxilio Mutuo Hospital, Dr. Batlle, and several other physicians, alleging negligence in the care and treatment of LaPlace-Bayard at Auxilio Mutuo Hospital in August 1998. Specifically with respect to Dr. Batlle (the only defendant relevant to this appeal), plaintiffs claimed in their pre-trial submission that Dr. Batlle, upon diagnosing LaPlace-Bayard with \"acute abdomen\" on August 7, 1998, should have immediately diagnosed a perforated colon and performed remedial surgery. He failed to do so and instead waited over twelve hours before performing the surgery.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> That delay caused additional fecal material to leak into LaPlace-Bayard's abdominal cavity, exacerbating the infection. Plaintiffs alleged that Dr. Batlle thus breached his duty of care owed to LaPlace-Bayard under Puerto Rico law, specifically 31 L.P.R.A. &#167; 5141,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and caused her severe physical injury and emotional pain. Dr. Batlle responded that he was not negligent in his care and treatment of LaPlace-Bayard and that LaPlace-Bayard was largely at fault for her damages because she failed to follow the instructions provided by her physicians.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over the course of the litigation, the parties engaged in settlement discussions. By August 16, 2000, plaintiffs had reached a settlement<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> with all of the defendants, except for Dr. Batlle. Previously, in a scheduling order dated January 26, 2000, the court had informed the parties that a pre-trial conference was to be held on August 22, 2000, and directed them to file a Joint Proposed Pre-trial Order in advance of that conference. On August 18, 2000, plaintiffs informed the court that (1) a settlement had been reached with four of the five named defendants; (2) they were hopeful that a Joint Proposed Pre-Trial Order would not have to be filed in this case because a settlement with Dr. Batlle, the sole remaining defendant in the case, seemed imminent; and (3) in the event a settlement was not reached with Dr. Batlle by August 21, 2000, the proposed pre-trial order would be submitted at that point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 22, 2000, the pre-trial conference was cancelled because of Hurricane Debby. On August 23, 2000, Dr. Batlle sent a letter to plaintiffs categorically rejecting any settlement demand. The next day, plaintiffs filed (1) a motion to reschedule a pre-trial/settlement conference and (2) given defense counsel's unwillingness to participate in a joint submission, a unilateral proposed pre-trial order, listing Dr. Vilaire Bayard, Jr., M.D.,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> a Massachusetts-based surgeon, as their only expert witness. Dr. Batlle did not list any expert witnesses in his pre-trial submission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 16, 2000, the court held a status conference. Plaintiffs informed the court that settlement efforts with Dr. Batlle had been unsuccessful to date, but that they were not prepared for trial. Nevertheless, the district court issued an order which provided:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case has been settled as to all defendants except Dr. Francisco Batlle-Batlle. The demand against this physician is $20,000. The court strongly recommends that the case be settled in that amount.... 10 days to report. Trial shall be held Nov. 2, [20]00, 9:30 A.M.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, plaintiffs gave Dr. Batlle until October 25, 2000, to accept the settlement demand. On that date, Dr. Batlle again flatly rejected the settlement demand, setting in motion a flurry of trial preparation activity, including the following: (1) on October 26, plaintiffs filed an emergency motion to take a videotaped deposition of Dr. Bayard and to substitute that deposition for his live testimony, due to his unavailability to appear at trial; that motion was granted over defendant's objection, and the deposition was taken on October 31 in Worcester, Massachusetts; (2) also on October 26, plaintiffs notified the court of their intention to name an additional medical expert witness, Dr. Claudia Lorenzo P&#233;rez, M.D. (Dr. Lorenzo) and the next day filed a motion to supplement their proposed pre-trial order to include Dr. Lorenzo as an expert witness. In opposition to that motion, Dr. Batlle filed an in limine motion to bar Dr. Lorenzo from testifying at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial commenced on November 2, 2000. At trial, Dr. Bayard, via his October 31 videotaped deposition, provided expert testimony on behalf of plaintiffs on the applicable duty of care owed by Dr. Batlle to LaPlace-Bayard. Upon the close of Dr. Bayard's testimony, the court, granting Dr. Batlle's in limine motion, barred Dr. Lorenzo from testifying as an expert witness in plaintiffs' case. In defendant's case, Dr. Batlle testified on his own behalf but presented no independent medical expert testimony. The jury returned a no-liability verdict for Dr. Batlle and judgment was entered accordingly. This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs raise two issues on appeal as grounds for a new trial. First, they argue that the court improperly excluded testimony of Dr. Lorenzo, one of their two proposed medical expert witnesses. Second, they claim that Dr. Batlle testified as an expert witness and should not have been allowed to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Exclusion of Dr. Lorenzo's Medical Expert Testimony</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court explained its decision to exclude Dr. Lorenzo's testimony as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I have read the doctor's report, and I have a serious concern about the fact that this case has been on the docket for quite a while. And the truth of the matter is that everybody left expert retaining and preparation for the very last minute. Perhaps everybody thought the case would settle. I'm not trying to find fault here, but the truth of the matter is that since October 16th it was quite evident that this case could be tried, especially when it did not settle as to one of the co-defendants. And I find it a bit difficult to accept that somebody who is retained in the middle of taking Dr. Bayard's deposition on October 30th and October 31st is going to testify now and has not been consulted before. And I think it's quite cumulative, also. And I have read [Dr. Lorenzo's] report, and I don't see anything there that [Dr. Bayard] has not covered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two grounds for the exclusion of Dr. Lorenzo's testimony apparent from this ruling: (1) plaintiffs failed to timely announce their intention to use Dr. Lorenzo as an expert witness, and (2) Dr. Lorenzo's anticipated testimony (as evidenced from her expert report) would be cumulative of Dr. Bayard's expert testimony, already admitted into evidence by videotape deposition. We examine each rationale in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Untimely Disclosure</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's exclusion of Dr. Lorenzo's testimony on the ground of untimely disclosure is a discovery sanction under Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(c)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> for a violation of the mandatory discovery rules under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(2).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> We review that ruling under an abuse of discretion standard. <i>See Thibeault v. Square D Co.,</i> 960 F.2d 239, 243 (1st Cir.1992) (\"In reviewing a trial court's sanction order concerning a discovery-related matter, an abuse-of-discretion standard controls.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 26(a)(2) mandates the timely disclosure of the identity of expert witnesses as well as expert reports in accordance with the directions of the trial court. Here, the district court, in its January 26, 2000, scheduling order, directed the parties to identify their expert witnesses and summarize each expert witness's qualifications in a joint proposed pre-trial order to be filed no later than August 18, 2000. In their August pre-trial memorandum, however, plaintiffs listed Dr. Bayard as their only expert witness. It was not until October 26, 2000, barely a week before trial, that plaintiffs disclosed their intention to use Dr. Lorenzo as an expert witness.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Until then, Dr. Batlle had no notice of plaintiffs' intention to retain another medical expert witness. Dr. Lorenzo's expert report and curriculum vitae were not provided to Dr. Batlle until the night of October 30, 2000, a mere three days before trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs argue that their failure to comply with the discovery rules in a more timely manner was justified by the \"unusual\" circumstances of the case, described as the likelihood of settlement with all of the defendants. Given that likelihood, they opted not to retain Dr. Lorenzo earlier in the litigation in an effort to keep costs down, thus maximizing the possibility of settlement. Only on October 25 when Dr. Batlle unequivocally rejected the $20,000 settlement demand did they retain Dr. Lorenzo as an expert and expedite the production of expert reports.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That justification, however, is woefully inadequate to excuse plaintiffs' tardy disclosures. Litigants routinely engage in settlement negotiations until the eve of trial and beyond. That reality does not excuse them from responding to interrogatories and retaining experts and disclosing them and their reports to opposing counsel in a timely manner pursuant to the discovery rules. Plaintiffs simply chose to postpone the costs associated with retaining an expert in an attempt to increase, in their view, the likelihood of settlement. In doing so, they assumed the risk that their delayed trial preparation would compromise their ability to put on their best case. To excuse their belated disclosures now would relieve them of the consequences of the risk they assumed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, we have recognized that \"[i]n the arena of expert discovery &#8212; a setting which often involves complex factual inquiries &#8212; Rule 26 increases the quality of trials by better preparing attorneys for cross-examination.\" <i>Id.</i> at 244. We cannot ignore the real danger that, if Dr. Lorenzo had been allowed to testify, plaintiffs' belated disclosures would have undermined defense counsel's ability to cross-examine her. <i>See id.</i> at 246-47 (\"Many courts &#8212; this court included &#8212; have recognized the introduction of new expert testimony on the eve of trial can be seriously prejudicial to the opposing party.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted above, district courts have broad discretion in meting out Rule 37(c) sanctions for Rule 26 violations. <i>See Ortiz-Lopez v. Sociedad Espanola de Auxilio Mutuo Y Beneficiencia de Puerto Rico,</i> 248 F.3d 29, 34 (1st Cir.2001). These sanctions range from limited exclusion to dismissal of the case entirely. <i>See id.</i> \"[E]xclusion of evidence is a standard sanction for a violation of the duty of disclosure under Rule 26(a).\" <i>Samos Imex Corp. v. Nextel Communications, Inc.,</i> 194 F.3d 301, 305 (1st Cir.1999). Given the facts in this case, we could hardly say that the district court exceeded its discretion in excluding Dr. Lorenzo's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Cumulativeness</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the sake of completeness, and to dispel any notion of plaintiffs that the exclusionary ruling of the trial court was somehow unfair to them, we evaluate the court's second ground for excluding Dr. Lorenzo's testimony, namely, that it would have been cumulative under Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence in light of the testimony of Dr. Bayard, plaintiffs' other medical expert.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs insist that the court did not understand the full scope of their case. They claim that their case against Dr. Batlle was premised upon two discrete negligence theories of liability to be addressed separately by each expert. Dr. Bayard, trained as a surgeon, testified only as to Dr. Batlle's negligence in his capacity as LaPlace-Bayard's surgeon. Dr. Lorenzo &#8212; an alleged expert on matters of risk management and the administration of health institutions &#8212; would have testified as to the negligence of Dr. Batlle in his role as LaPlace-Bayard's attending physician and in managing the post-operative risks associated with her condition. Thus, having retained two separate experts to serve two distinct purposes, plaintiffs maintain that Dr. Lorenzo's testimony would have differed dramatically from that of Dr. Bayard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs overstate the pre-trial clarity of their two discrete theories of Dr. Batlle's liability. In their pre-trial submission, they articulated only one theory of liability to the trial court &#8212; namely, that Dr. Batlle was negligent in his role as LaPlace-Bayard's surgeon:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Batlle noted acute abdominal pain and high fever. Dr. Batlle should have immediately diagnosed a punctured colon and performed immediate remedial surgery. <i>As a result of Dr. Batlle's failure to timely diagnose [LaPlace-Bayard's] punctured colon and his failure to timely perform corrective surgery,</i> she suffered permanent and irreparable physical injuries, and continues to suffer both substantial emotional and physical pain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added). In that submission, plaintiffs further characterized the ultimate facts in dispute as \"the extent of the damage <i>caused by the delay in performing corrective surgery</i> after [LaPlace-Bayard] presented herself at the emergency room with acute abdominal pain.\" (emphasis added). There is no mention in plaintiffs' pre-trial memorandum that their theory of the case included Dr. Batlle's negligence in LaPlace-Bayard's post-operative care, including managing the risks associated with her post-operative condition. In the absence of such timely representations to the court below, we doubt that plaintiffs could rely on that broader theory of liability now to win a new trial. <i>See Thibeault,</i> 960 F.2d at 247 (noting potential for prejudice to opposing counsel in \"an eleventh-hour change in a party's theory of the case\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not decide that issue, however, because Dr. Bayard did present testimony on Dr. Batlle's post-operative negligence, as plaintiffs said he would. Contrary to their position on appeal, plaintiffs explicitly stated in an October 26, 2000, court submission that \"Dr. Bayard will serve as the Plaintiffs' expert on surgery and the quality of aftercare rendered post-operatively by Dr. Battle [sic].\" Similarly, plaintiffs' counsel explicitly stated at Dr. Bayard's October 31 deposition his intention to use Dr. Bayard both \"as an expert in this trial with respect to the surgical procedures, and the quality of after-care that was rendered by the surgeon, Dr. Francisco Batlle.\" The record indicates that Dr. Bayard did in fact provide expert opinion testimony on both the August 8 surgery as well as the quality of after-care provided by Dr. Batlle in his role as attending physician.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the surgery, Dr. Bayard testified that, when a patient presents with acute abdomen after recently undergoing surgery to remove an ovarian cyst, a physician should suspect a perforated bowel and should perform surgery immediately. He testified that there was no medical justification for Dr. Batlle's waiting twelve hours to perform the surgery. His testimony, however, did not end there. Dr. Bayard proceeded to testify as to (1) the diagnostic lab tests that should have been performed on LaPlace-Bayard in the days following the August 8 surgery; (2) his opinion on the range of antibiotics Dr. Batlle administered to LaPlace-Bayard after surgery; and (3) his opinion that Dr. Batlle should have taken a culture of the infection observed during surgery in order to know what antibiotics to administer. He testified that LaPlace-Bayard should not have been discharged from the hospital on August 16, 1998, because it was likely she was suffering from acute pancreatitis and other conditions at that time. In light of Dr. Bayard's testimony as to LaPlace-Bayard's post-operative care, we can hardly find fault with the district court's finding that Dr. Lorenzo's proffered testimony would have been cumulative evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a further effort to distinguish Dr. Lorenzo's testimony from that of Dr. Bayard, plaintiffs argue that Dr. Bayard's credibility may have been diminished because (1) he was plaintiff Daniel Bayard's second cousin, and (2) Dr. Bayard, unable to read Spanish, was limited in his review of the medical file to those records that were in English. Thus, plaintiffs argue, the testimony of Dr. Lorenzo (who was fluent in Spanish and thus able to review the entire medical file) would have bolstered the strength of their case. Again, plaintiffs seek relief from the consequences of their own decisions. Plaintiffs chose to disclose in their pre-trial submission only one medical expert witness, knowing of his inability to understand Spanish and of his relationship to Daniel Bayard. Moreover, plaintiffs could have provided Dr. Bayard with an English translation of the Spanish portions of the medical record. They chose not to do so. Having made these decisions, they cannot complain now of the consequences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, plaintiffs claim that even if the exclusion of Dr. Lorenzo's testimony was otherwise warranted, the timing of the court's ruling irreparably prejudiced them. They point out that, although Dr. Batlle had filed his motion to exclude Dr. Lorenzo's testimony before trial had commenced, it was not until after the court heard Dr. Bayard's videotaped deposition testimony that it announced its decision to exclude Dr. Lorenzo's testimony. At that point, however, plaintiffs had already told the jury in their opening statement that it would hear testimony from \"experts\" in the plural. They now claim that the court's ruling prevented them from keeping their promise of introducing testimony from more than one expert, thus undermining their credibility with the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time that plaintiffs gave their opening statement, they knew that the court had not yet ruled on Dr. Batlle's motion to exclude Dr. Lorenzo's testimony. Well aware of that pending in limine motion, plaintiffs proceeded at their peril in promising the jury testimony from more than one expert. Having made that choice, plaintiffs cannot expect once again to be relieved of the consequences of their own judgment call.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Admission of Dr. Batlle's Testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In considering plaintiffs' second ground for appeal, we note at the outset that the court never characterized Dr. Batlle as an expert witness, stating instead that Dr. Batlle would be \"treated as the surgeon who operated on\" LaPlace-Bayard. Nevertheless, plaintiffs argue that Dr. Batlle gave expert testimony at trial and should not have been allowed to do so without providing an expert report and disclosing his qualifications as required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(2)(B).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite these general averments, plaintiffs fail to identify which particular statements of Dr. Batlle should have been excluded. Nor did they raise at trial any specific objections (save one as to relevancy) during the course of Dr. Batlle's direct examination. Having carefully examined the trial transcript of Dr. Batlle's direct testimony ourselves, we cannot identify a colorable basis for plaintiffs' claim of error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his direct examination, Dr. Batlle methodically took the jury through a day-by-day account of his actions and decisions relating to the care and treatment of LaPlace-Bayard at Auxilio Mutuo Hospital from August 7, 1998, through her discharge on August 16, 1998. He was never asked on direct to render opinions regarding treatment by other physicians or other institutions. Dr. Batlle only offered opinions beyond the scope of his own treatment of LaPlace-Bayard in response to plaintiffs' own questions on cross-examination as to the treatment given to LaPlace-Bayard at Palms West Hospital after her discharge from Auxilio Mutuo Hospital.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Having opened the door to that testimony, plaintiffs cannot now be heard to complain about the court's admission of such testimony.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> <i>See McDonald v.

Plaintiffs-appellants &#8212; Lily LaPlace-Bayard, her husband Daniel Bayard, and their conjugal partnership (collectively \"plaintiffs\") &#8212; brought this diversity action in negligence against, <i>inter alia,</i> defendant-appellee, Dr. Francisco Batlle, alleging that Dr. Batlle breached the duty of care owed to his patient LaPlace-Bayard when he failed to timely diagnose her condition and perform immediate remedial surgery, causing her substantial injury. After trial, the jury returned a verdict for Dr. Batlle, and judgment was accordingly entered in his favor. On appeal, plaintiffs seek a new trial on the grounds that the trial court abused its discretion by (1) excluding the testimony of one of their proposed medical experts and (2) allowing Dr. Batlle to testify as an expert witness. Unpersuaded by plaintiffs' arguments, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the summer of 1998, when LaPlace-Bayard and her then-fiance Daniel Bayard were residents of the U.S. Virgin Islands, LaPlace-Bayard was diagnosed with a cyst on one of her ovaries. Upon consultation with a gynecologist in Puerto Rico, LaPlace-Bayard decided to undergo surgery to have the cyst removed. The surgery took place on August 6, 1998, at Auxilio Mutuo Hospital in Puerto Rico. It is undisputed by the parties to this appeal that, during surgery, the operating physician inadvertently perforated LaPlace-Bayard's colon in removing the cyst. That perforation went unnoticed, however, and LaPlace-Bayard was discharged from the hospital later that day. Complaining of abdominal pain and fever, LaPlace-Bayard returned to the hospital on August 7, 1998, where she was seen by, <i>inter alia,</i> an emergency room surgeon, Dr. Batlle, who diagnosed her as suffering from \"acute abdomen,\" an intra-abdominal condition manifested by severe pain. On August 8, 1998, Dr. Batlle performed exploratory surgery on LaPlace-Bayard and, upon discovery, repaired the perforation in her colon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following surgery, Dr. Batlle, as her attending physician, had primary responsibility for LaPlace-Bayard during her post-operative stay in the hospital. Given the risk of infection associated with colon perforation reparation, Dr. Batlle put LaPlace-Bayard on a regimen of antibiotics and arranged for a consultation with an infectious disease specialist. After her discharge from the hospital on August 16, 1998, she returned to her residence in St. Thomas. However, she continued to experience nausea, abdominal pain and difficulty breathing. As a result, on August 23, 1998, LaPlace-Bayard admitted herself into Palms West Hospital in Florida, where she was treated for acute pancreatitis, severe pleural effusion (fluid in the thoracic cavity), suppurative peritonitis (infection in abdominal cavity), and a serious bacterial infection. She was discharged from Palms West on September 1, 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 5, 1999, plaintiffs brought this medical malpractice action against, <i>inter alia,</i> Auxilio Mutuo Hospital, Dr. Batlle, and several other physicians, alleging negligence in the care and treatment of LaPlace-Bayard at Auxilio Mutuo Hospital in August 1998. Specifically with respect to Dr. Batlle (the only defendant relevant to this appeal), plaintiffs claimed in their pre-trial submission that Dr. Batlle, upon diagnosing LaPlace-Bayard with \"acute abdomen\" on August 7, 1998, should have immediately diagnosed a perforated colon and performed remedial surgery. He failed to do so and instead waited over twelve hours before performing the surgery.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> That delay caused additional fecal material to leak into LaPlace-Bayard's abdominal cavity, exacerbating the infection. Plaintiffs alleged that Dr. Batlle thus breached his duty of care owed to LaPlace-Bayard under Puerto Rico law, specifically 31 L.P.R.A. &#167; 5141,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and caused her severe physical injury and emotional pain. Dr. Batlle responded that he was not negligent in his care and treatment of LaPlace-Bayard and that LaPlace-Bayard was largely at fault for her damages because she failed to follow the instructions provided by her physicians.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over the course of the litigation, the parties engaged in settlement discussions. By August 16, 2000, plaintiffs had reached a settlement<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> with all of the defendants, except for Dr. Batlle. Previously, in a scheduling order dated January 26, 2000, the court had informed the parties that a pre-trial conference was to be held on August 22, 2000, and directed them to file a Joint Proposed Pre-trial Order in advance of that conference. On August 18, 2000, plaintiffs informed the court that (1) a settlement had been reached with four of the five named defendants; (2) they were hopeful that a Joint Proposed Pre-Trial Order would not have to be filed in this case because a settlement with Dr. Batlle, the sole remaining defendant in the case, seemed imminent; and (3) in the event a settlement was not reached with Dr. Batlle by August 21, 2000, the proposed pre-trial order would be submitted at that point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 22, 2000, the pre-trial conference was cancelled because of Hurricane Debby. On August 23, 2000, Dr. Batlle sent a letter to plaintiffs categorically rejecting any settlement demand. The next day, plaintiffs filed (1) a motion to reschedule a pre-trial/settlement conference and (2) given defense counsel's unwillingness to participate in a joint submission, a unilateral proposed pre-trial order, listing Dr. Vilaire Bayard, Jr., M.D.,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> a Massachusetts-based surgeon, as their only expert witness. Dr. Batlle did not list any expert witnesses in his pre-trial submission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 16, 2000, the court held a status conference. Plaintiffs informed the court that settlement efforts with Dr. Batlle had been unsuccessful to date, but that they were not prepared for trial. Nevertheless, the district court issued an order which provided:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case has been settled as to all defendants except Dr. Francisco Batlle-Batlle. The demand against this physician is $20,000. The court strongly recommends that the case be settled in that amount.... 10 days to report. Trial shall be held Nov. 2, [20]00, 9:30 A.M.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, plaintiffs gave Dr. Batlle until October 25, 2000, to accept the settlement demand. On that date, Dr. Batlle again flatly rejected the settlement demand, setting in motion a flurry of trial preparation activity, including the following: (1) on October 26, plaintiffs filed an emergency motion to take a videotaped deposition of Dr. Bayard and to substitute that deposition for his live testimony, due to his unavailability to appear at trial; that motion was granted over defendant's objection, and the deposition was taken on October 31 in Worcester, Massachusetts; (2) also on October 26, plaintiffs notified the court of their intention to name an additional medical expert witness, Dr. Claudia Lorenzo P&#233;rez, M.D. (Dr. Lorenzo) and the next day filed a motion to supplement their proposed pre-trial order to include Dr. Lorenzo as an expert witness. In opposition to that motion, Dr. Batlle filed an in limine motion to bar Dr. Lorenzo from testifying at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial commenced on November 2, 2000. At trial, Dr. Bayard, via his October 31 videotaped deposition, provided expert testimony on behalf of plaintiffs on the applicable duty of care owed by Dr. Batlle to LaPlace-Bayard. Upon the close of Dr. Bayard's testimony, the court, granting Dr. Batlle's in limine motion, barred Dr. Lorenzo from testifying as an expert witness in plaintiffs' case. In defendant's case, Dr. Batlle testified on his own behalf but presented no independent medical expert testimony. The jury returned a no-liability verdict for Dr. Batlle and judgment was entered accordingly. This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs raise two issues on appeal as grounds for a new trial. First, they argue that the court improperly excluded testimony of Dr. Lorenzo, one of their two proposed medical expert witnesses. Second, they claim that Dr. Batlle testified as an expert witness and should not have been allowed to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Exclusion of Dr. Lorenzo's Medical Expert Testimony</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court explained its decision to exclude Dr. Lorenzo's testimony as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I have read the doctor's report, and I have a serious concern about the fact that this case has been on the docket for quite a while. And the truth of the matter is that everybody left expert retaining and preparation for the very last minute. Perhaps everybody thought the case would settle. I'm not trying to find fault here, but the truth of the matter is that since October 16th it was quite evident that this case could be tried, especially when it did not settle as to one of the co-defendants. And I find it a bit difficult to accept that somebody who is retained in the middle of taking Dr. Bayard's deposition on October 30th and October 31st is going to testify now and has not been consulted before. And I think it's quite cumulative, also. And I have read [Dr. Lorenzo's] report, and I don't see anything there that [Dr. Bayard] has not covered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two grounds for the exclusion of Dr. Lorenzo's testimony apparent from this ruling: (1) plaintiffs failed to timely announce their intention to use Dr. Lorenzo as an expert witness, and (2) Dr. Lorenzo's anticipated testimony (as evidenced from her expert report) would be cumulative of Dr. Bayard's expert testimony, already admitted into evidence by videotape deposition. We examine each rationale in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Untimely Disclosure</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's exclusion of Dr. Lorenzo's testimony on the ground of untimely disclosure is a discovery sanction under Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(c)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> for a violation of the mandatory discovery rules under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(2).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> We review that ruling under an abuse of discretion standard. <i>See Thibeault v. Square D Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580699\"><a href=\"/opinion/580699/charles-m-thibeault-v-square-d-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">239</span></a></span>, 243 (1st Cir.1992) (\"In reviewing a trial court's sanction order concerning a discovery-related matter, an abuse-of-discretion standard controls.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 26(a)(2) mandates the timely disclosure of the identity of expert witnesses as well as expert reports in accordance with the directions of the trial court. Here, the district court, in its January 26, 2000, scheduling order, directed the parties to identify their expert witnesses and summarize each expert witness's qualifications in a joint proposed pre-trial order to be filed no later than August 18, 2000. In their August pre-trial memorandum, however, plaintiffs listed Dr. Bayard as their only expert witness. It was not until October 26, 2000, barely a week before trial, that plaintiffs disclosed their intention to use Dr. Lorenzo as an expert witness.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Until then, Dr. Batlle had no notice of plaintiffs' intention to retain another medical expert witness. Dr. Lorenzo's expert report and curriculum vitae were not provided to Dr. Batlle until the night of October 30, 2000, a mere three days before trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs argue that their failure to comply with the discovery rules in a more timely manner was justified by the \"unusual\" circumstances of the case, described as the likelihood of settlement with all of the defendants. Given that likelihood, they opted not to retain Dr. Lorenzo earlier in the litigation in an effort to keep costs down, thus maximizing the possibility of settlement. Only on October 25 when Dr. Batlle unequivocally rejected the $20,000 settlement demand did they retain Dr. Lorenzo as an expert and expedite the production of expert reports.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That justification, however, is woefully inadequate to excuse plaintiffs' tardy disclosures. Litigants routinely engage in settlement negotiations until the eve of trial and beyond. That reality does not excuse them from responding to interrogatories and retaining experts and disclosing them and their reports to opposing counsel in a timely manner pursuant to the discovery rules. Plaintiffs simply chose to postpone the costs associated with retaining an expert in an attempt to increase, in their view, the likelihood of settlement. In doing so, they assumed the risk that their delayed trial preparation would compromise their ability to put on their best case. To excuse their belated disclosures now would relieve them of the consequences of the risk they assumed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, we have recognized that \"[i]n the arena of expert discovery &#8212; a setting which often involves complex factual inquiries &#8212; Rule 26 increases the quality of trials by better preparing attorneys for cross-examination.\" <i>Id.</i> at 244. We cannot ignore the real danger that, if Dr. Lorenzo had been allowed to testify, plaintiffs' belated disclosures would have undermined defense counsel's ability to cross-examine her. <i>See id.</i> at 246-47 (\"Many courts &#8212; this court included &#8212; have recognized the introduction of new expert testimony on the eve of trial can be seriously prejudicial to the opposing party.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted above, district courts have broad discretion in meting out Rule 37(c) sanctions for Rule 26 violations. <i>See Ortiz-Lopez v. Sociedad Espanola de Auxilio Mutuo Y Beneficiencia de Puerto Rico,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199391\"><a href=\"/opinion/199391/ortiz-lopez-v-sociedad-espanola/\"><span class=\"volume\">248</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span>, 34 (1st Cir.2001). These sanctions range from limited exclusion to dismissal of the case entirely. <i>See id.</i> \"[E]xclusion of evidence is a standard sanction for a violation of the duty of disclosure under Rule 26(a).\" <i>Samos Imex Corp. v. Nextel Communications, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198694\"><a href=\"/opinion/198694/samos-imex-v-nextel-communication/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">301</span></a></span>, 305 (1st Cir.1999). Given the facts in this case, we could hardly say that the district court exceeded its discretion in excluding Dr. Lorenzo's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Cumulativeness</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the sake of completeness, and to dispel any notion of plaintiffs that the exclusionary ruling of the trial court was somehow unfair to them, we evaluate the court's second ground for excluding Dr. Lorenzo's testimony, namely, that it would have been cumulative under Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence in light of the testimony of Dr. Bayard, plaintiffs' other medical expert.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs insist that the court did not understand the full scope of their case. They claim that their case against Dr. Batlle was premised upon two discrete negligence theories of liability to be addressed separately by each expert. Dr. Bayard, trained as a surgeon, testified only as to Dr. Batlle's negligence in his capacity as LaPlace-Bayard's surgeon. Dr. Lorenzo &#8212; an alleged expert on matters of risk management and the administration of health institutions &#8212; would have testified as to the negligence of Dr. Batlle in his role as LaPlace-Bayard's attending physician and in managing the post-operative risks associated with her condition. Thus, having retained two separate experts to serve two distinct purposes, plaintiffs maintain that Dr. Lorenzo's testimony would have differed dramatically from that of Dr. Bayard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs overstate the pre-trial clarity of their two discrete theories of Dr. Batlle's liability. In their pre-trial submission, they articulated only one theory of liability to the trial court &#8212; namely, that Dr. Batlle was negligent in his role as LaPlace-Bayard's surgeon:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Batlle noted acute abdominal pain and high fever. Dr. Batlle should have immediately diagnosed a punctured colon and performed immediate remedial surgery. <i>As a result of Dr. Batlle's failure to timely diagnose [LaPlace-Bayard's] punctured colon and his failure to timely perform corrective surgery,</i> she suffered permanent and irreparable physical injuries, and continues to suffer both substantial emotional and physical pain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added). In that submission, plaintiffs further characterized the ultimate facts in dispute as \"the extent of the damage <i>caused by the delay in performing corrective surgery</i> after [LaPlace-Bayard] presented herself at the emergency room with acute abdominal pain.\" (emphasis added). There is no mention in plaintiffs' pre-trial memorandum that their theory of the case included Dr. Batlle's negligence in LaPlace-Bayard's post-operative care, including managing the risks associated with her post-operative condition. In the absence of such timely representations to the court below, we doubt that plaintiffs could rely on that broader theory of liability now to win a new trial. <i>See Thibeault,</i> 960 F.2d at 247 (noting potential for prejudice to opposing counsel in \"an eleventh-hour change in a party's theory of the case\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not decide that issue, however, because Dr. Bayard did present testimony on Dr. Batlle's post-operative negligence, as plaintiffs said he would. Contrary to their position on appeal, plaintiffs explicitly stated in an October 26, 2000, court submission that \"Dr. Bayard will serve as the Plaintiffs' expert on surgery and the quality of aftercare rendered post-operatively by Dr. Battle [sic].\" Similarly, plaintiffs' counsel explicitly stated at Dr. Bayard's October 31 deposition his intention to use Dr. Bayard both \"as an expert in this trial with respect to the surgical procedures, and the quality of after-care that was rendered by the surgeon, Dr. Francisco Batlle.\" The record indicates that Dr. Bayard did in fact provide expert opinion testimony on both the August 8 surgery as well as the quality of after-care provided by Dr. Batlle in his role as attending physician.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the surgery, Dr. Bayard testified that, when a patient presents with acute abdomen after recently undergoing surgery to remove an ovarian cyst, a physician should suspect a perforated bowel and should perform surgery immediately. He testified that there was no medical justification for Dr. Batlle's waiting twelve hours to perform the surgery. His testimony, however, did not end there. Dr. Bayard proceeded to testify as to (1) the diagnostic lab tests that should have been performed on LaPlace-Bayard in the days following the August 8 surgery; (2) his opinion on the range of antibiotics Dr. Batlle administered to LaPlace-Bayard after surgery; and (3) his opinion that Dr. Batlle should have taken a culture of the infection observed during surgery in order to know what antibiotics to administer. He testified that LaPlace-Bayard should not have been discharged from the hospital on August 16, 1998, because it was likely she was suffering from acute pancreatitis and other conditions at that time. In light of Dr. Bayard's testimony as to LaPlace-Bayard's post-operative care, we can hardly find fault with the district court's finding that Dr. Lorenzo's proffered testimony would have been cumulative evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a further effort to distinguish Dr. Lorenzo's testimony from that of Dr. Bayard, plaintiffs argue that Dr. Bayard's credibility may have been diminished because (1) he was plaintiff Daniel Bayard's second cousin, and (2) Dr. Bayard, unable to read Spanish, was limited in his review of the medical file to those records that were in English. Thus, plaintiffs argue, the testimony of Dr. Lorenzo (who was fluent in Spanish and thus able to review the entire medical file) would have bolstered the strength of their case. Again, plaintiffs seek relief from the consequences of their own decisions. Plaintiffs chose to disclose in their pre-trial submission only one medical expert witness, knowing of his inability to understand Spanish and of his relationship to Daniel Bayard. Moreover, plaintiffs could have provided Dr. Bayard with an English translation of the Spanish portions of the medical record. They chose not to do so. Having made these decisions, they cannot complain now of the consequences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, plaintiffs claim that even if the exclusion of Dr. Lorenzo's testimony was otherwise warranted, the timing of the court's ruling irreparably prejudiced them. They point out that, although Dr. Batlle had filed his motion to exclude Dr. Lorenzo's testimony before trial had commenced, it was not until after the court heard Dr. Bayard's videotaped deposition testimony that it announced its decision to exclude Dr. Lorenzo's testimony. At that point, however, plaintiffs had already told the jury in their opening statement that it would hear testimony from \"experts\" in the plural. They now claim that the court's ruling prevented them from keeping their promise of introducing testimony from more than one expert, thus undermining their credibility with the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time that plaintiffs gave their opening statement, they knew that the court had not yet ruled on Dr. Batlle's motion to exclude Dr. Lorenzo's testimony. Well aware of that pending in limine motion, plaintiffs proceeded at their peril in promising the jury testimony from more than one expert. Having made that choice, plaintiffs cannot expect once again to be relieved of the consequences of their own judgment call.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Admission of Dr. Batlle's Testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In considering plaintiffs' second ground for appeal, we note at the outset that the court never characterized Dr. Batlle as an expert witness, stating instead that Dr. Batlle would be \"treated as the surgeon who operated on\" LaPlace-Bayard. Nevertheless, plaintiffs argue that Dr. Batlle gave expert testimony at trial and should not have been allowed to do so without providing an expert report and disclosing his qualifications as required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(2)(B).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite these general averments, plaintiffs fail to identify which particular statements of Dr. Batlle should have been excluded. Nor did they raise at trial any specific objections (save one as to relevancy) during the course of Dr. Batlle's direct examination. Having carefully examined the trial transcript of Dr. Batlle's direct testimony ourselves, we cannot identify a colorable basis for plaintiffs' claim of error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his direct examination, Dr. Batlle methodically took the jury through a day-by-day account of his actions and decisions relating to the care and treatment of LaPlace-Bayard at Auxilio Mutuo Hospital from August 7, 1998, through her discharge on August 16, 1998. He was never asked on direct to render opinions regarding treatment by other physicians or other institutions. Dr. Batlle only offered opinions beyond the scope of his own treatment of LaPlace-Bayard in response to plaintiffs' own questions on cross-examination as to the treatment given to LaPlace-Bayard at Palms West Hospital after her discharge from Auxilio Mutuo Hospital.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Having opened the door to that testimony, plaintiffs cannot now be heard to complain about the court's admission of such testimony.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> <i>See McDonald v.
