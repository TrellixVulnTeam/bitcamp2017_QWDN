This case arises out of what is\n\nalleged   to    have    been    discriminatory       action    by   a   government\n\nemployer. After testing the waters in two different administrative\n\nfora, the claimant abruptly repaired to the federal district court.\n\nThat   court    rejected       her   importunings    on     procedural    grounds.\n\nConcluding, as we do, that the claimant's original election of\n\nremedies barred her subsequent attempt to sue, we affirm the\n\ndismissal of her action.\n\n             Because the district court acted dispositively on a\n\nmotion to dismiss, we glean the few facts that are necessary to an\n\nundertaking      of     this     appeal    from      the     amended     complaint\n\n(supplemented, for the sake of completeness, by certain undisputed\n\nfacts).      See Redondo-Borges v. U.S. Dep't of Hous. & Urban Dev.,\n\n421 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n             Plaintiff-appellant Josephine Stoll worked in the human\n\nresources office of the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in San\n\nJuan, Puerto Rico from 1987 until the termination of her employment\n\non September 28, 2001.         The appellant alleges that the controlling\n\nagency, the Department of Veterans Affairs (V.A.), created a\n\nhostile work environment and unlawfully discharged her based on her\n\nage (fifty-nine) and her deteriorating health.                 She also alleges\n\nthat   the     V.A.'s   stated       justification    for     her   ouster   —   an\n\naccumulation of warnings and admonishments related to workplace\n\n\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fattendance and leave policies — resulted directly from arbitrary\n\nharassment by her supervisors.\n\n           Initially, the appellant chose to challenge her discharge\n\nbefore the Merit Systems Protection Board (the Board).                See 5\n\nC.F.R. § 1201.22.    In this administrative appeal, filed on October\n\n10, 2001, she charged that discriminatory motives had prompted her\n\nfiring.1   After she had asked to postpone an upcoming hearing due\n\nto her failing health, the Board dismissed her administrative\n\nappeal without prejudice.\n\n           On    February   10,   2002,   the    appellant    refiled    her\n\nadministrative appeal.      This time it went forward and, four months\n\nlater, the Board affirmed the V.A.'s decision to terminate her\n\nemployment.     See Stoll-Roche v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, No. NY-\n\n0752-02-0028-I-2 (M.S.P.B. June 12, 2002).          The Board thereafter\n\ndenied the appellant's subsequent petition for further review. See\n\nStoll-Roche v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, 94 M.S.P.R. 486 (2003)\n\n(table).\n\n           While   these    proceedings   were   ongoing,    the   appellant\n\ncontacted a V.A. equal employment opportunity (EEO) counselor. She\n\nfiled a formal EEO complaint with the agency on May 2, 2002.            The\n\nagency dismissed the complaint.       Undaunted, the appellant sought\n\n\n     1\n      In such circumstances, an appeal filed with the Board is\ntermed a \"mixed case,\" that is, an appeal alleging that \"an\nappealable agency action was effected, in whole or in part, because\nof discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex,\nnational origin, handicap, or age.\" 29 C.F.R. § 1614.302(a)(2).\n\n                                   -3-\n\freview of that decision before the Equal Employment Opportunity\n\nCommission (the Commission). The Commission affirmed the dismissal\n\non the ground that the appellant had a proceeding pending before\n\nthe Board.          See Stoll-Roche v. Principi, E.E.O.C. Appeal No.\n\n01A23304 (Oct. 11, 2002) (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1614.107(a)(4)).\n\n                The appellant next commenced an action in the United\n\nStates District Court for the District of Puerto Rico.                   She named\n\na gaggle of defendants, including the Secretary of Veterans Affairs\n\n(the Secretary).2           Her amended complaint raised a gallimaufry of\n\nclaims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII),\n\n42   U.S.C.       §§     2000e   to   2000e-17,   the    Age    Discrimination    in\n\nEmployment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. §§ 621-634, section 501 of the\n\nRehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 791, and local law, see\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, §§ 146, 185a.                    The Secretary moved to\n\ndismiss the action on divers grounds.                 See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b).\n\nThe court referred the matter to a magistrate judge, see Fed. R.\n\nCiv.       P.   72(b),    who    concluded,   inter     alia,   that   federal   law\n\npreempted the local law claims; that Title VII did not cover the\n\ncharges of age and disability discrimination; and that the ADEA and\n\nRehabilitation Act claims ought to be dismissed for failure to\n\nexhaust administrative remedies.                See Stoll v. Principi, No. 02-\n\n\n\n       2\n      Because it is crystal clear that the Secretary is the only\nproper defendant, see 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-16(c), we do not rehearse\nthe roster of other defendants. Rather, we henceforth refer to the\nSecretary as if he were the sole defendant.\n\n                                          -4-\n\f2761, slip op. at 8-14 (D.P.R. Feb. 1, 2005) (unpublished).                  On\n\nthat basis, the magistrate judge recommended dismissal of the\n\nentire action.      Id. at 16.\n\n              The appellant objected to the magistrate judge's report\n\nand recommendation.          The district court reviewed the matter de\n\nnovo,   see     Fed.    R.   Civ.   P.   72(b),    adopted   the   report   and\n\nrecommendation,        and   dismissed    the   suit.    This   timely   appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n              Our standard of review is familiar.               We assess the\n\ndistrict court's order of dismissal de novo, taking as true the\n\nwell-pleaded facts contained in the amended complaint and drawing\n\nall reasonable inferences therefrom in the appellant's favor.\n\nGarrett v. Tandy Corp., 295 F.3d 94, 97 (1st Cir. 2002); Rogan v.\n\nMenino, 175 F.3d 75, 77 (1st Cir. 1999).             We are not wedded to the\n\nlower court's rationale but may affirm the order of dismissal on\n\nany ground made manifest by the record.            See Gabriel v. Preble, 396\n\nF.3d 10, 12 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n              We begin with the basics.         A federal employee who claims\n\nto have been cashiered for discriminatory reasons typically may\n\nchallenge that adverse employment action along either of two\n\nroutes.   For one thing, she may appeal to the Board.              See 5 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1201.151. Alternatively, she may lodge an EEO complaint with her\n\nagency.   See 29 C.F.R. § 1614.103(a).            An aggrieved employee (or,\n\nas in this case, an aggrieved former employee) has a choice between\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fthese two options — but she may not avail herself of both.         See 29\n\nC.F.R. § 1614.302(b) (recognizing that once a formal appeal or\n\ncomplaint is filed in either forum, it \"shall be considered an\n\nelection to proceed in that forum\"); see also Castro v. United\n\nStates, 775 F.2d 399, 404 & n.5 (1st Cir. 1985) (per curiam).         The\n\nlodging of either a formal appeal with the Board or a formal\n\ncomplaint with the agency demarcates the point of no return.         See\n\n29 C.F.R. § 1614.302(b).    From that point forward, the complainant\n\nmust exhaust her claim in the chosen forum.           See Economou v.\n\nCaldera, 286 F.3d 144, 149 (2d Cir. 2002) (holding that a federal\n\nemployee who had first filed a formal appeal with the Board was\n\nrequired to exhaust his administrative remedies in that forum and\n\ncould not move at will to the other track).\n\n            The   Commission's   regulations   highlight   the   mutually\n\nexclusive nature of the two fora.        They provide explicitly that\n\n\"the agency shall dismiss an entire complaint . . . [w]here the\n\ncomplainant has raised the matter . . . in an appeal to the\n\n[Board].\"    29 C.F.R. § 1614.107(a).    The Commission dismissed the\n\nappellant's complaint on precisely that ground.3\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      To be sure, the two remedial paths do reach a crossroads.\nUpon the Board's issuance of a final decision, the appellant could\nhave petitioned the Commission to review that decision.      See 5\nU.S.C. § 7702(b)(1) (providing for Commission review of certain\nBoard decisions); see also 5 C.F.R. § 1201.161; 29 C.F.R. §\n1614.303(a).   Here, however, the appellant never pursued this\npossibility.\n\n                                   -6-\n\f            This election of remedies doctrine is dispositive here.\n\nThe appellant initially filed an appeal with the Board on October\n\n10, 2001, and refiled it on February 10, 2002.                By pressing that\n\nappeal,    she   made   an   election    of     remedies.      Thus,   when   she\n\nsubsequently attempted to switch horses in mid-stream and filed a\n\nformal EEO complaint with the agency on May 2, 2002 — during the\n\npendency of her appeal before the Board — that filing was a\n\nnullity.\n\n            To say more would be to paint the lily.                    With two\n\nremedial paths open to her, the appellant chose to test the\n\nlegitimacy of her termination by filing a formal appeal with the\n\nBoard.    The proceedings before the Board were in full flower when\n\nshe reversed direction and submitted a formal EEO complaint.\n\nHaving elected to travel one path (before the Board), she forfeited\n\nher right simultaneously to explore the alternative path (before\n\nthe Commission).\n\n            Of course, the Board process that the appellant elected\n\nto pursue did not exclude her from all access to the courts.                  See,\n\ne.g., 5 C.F.R. § 1201.120 (providing for review of final Board\n\ndecisions   in   the    Court    of   Appeals    for   the   Federal   Circuit).\n\nMoreover, this is a mixed case, see supra note 1, so the appellant,\n\nqua complainant, could have filed a civil action in an appropriate\n\nfederal district court within thirty days after receiving the\n\nBoard's final decision.         See 5 C.F.R. § 1201.175.      In either event,\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fhowever, the complainant must wait until the Board takes final\n\naction before seeking judicial review.       See 5 U.S.C. § 7702(a)(3);\n\n5 C.F.R. §§ 1201.157, 1201.161(b).        The appellant jumped the gun\n\nand, thus, cannot fit her action into this integument.\n\n           The reason for the appellant's premature commencement of\n\nan action in the district court seems readily evident.                 She\n\napparently envisioned her suit as an attempted extension of the EEO\n\nprocess (the record strongly suggests that conclusion and her brief\n\non appeal confirms it).     But as we have pointed out, the EEO forum\n\nwas not open to her by the time that she belatedly tried to switch\n\nto that track.     Her action was, therefore, untenable.\n\n           The short of it is that, once a government employee\n\nelects to pursue a mixed case before the Board, she is obliged to\n\nfollow that route through to completion, to the exclusion of any\n\nother remedy that originally might have been available.                See\n\nEconomou, 286 F.3d at 150.\n\n           There are at least two reasons why this action cannot be\n\nsalvaged   under   the   judicial   review   provisions   applicable    to\n\nproceedings before the Board.       First, the appellant has proffered\n\nno argument along those lines and, therefore, any such claim has\n\nbeen abandoned.    See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st\n\nCir. 1990) (explaining that \"a litigant has an obligation to spell\n\nout [her] arguments squarely and distinctly, or else forever hold\n\n[her] peace\" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fSecond, judicial review of that nature must await a final decision\n\nof the Board.      See 5 C.F.R. §§ 1201.157, 1201.161(b).   In this\n\ninstance, the appellant commenced her district court action on\n\nDecember 3, 2002 — some nine months before the Board issued its\n\nfinal decision.4\n\n            We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe hold that this action was improvidently brought in the district\n\ncourt and was, therefore, appropriately dismissed.       Given that\n\nholding, we need address neither the other grounds for dismissal\n\nlimned by the magistrate judge nor the merits of the appellant's\n\nclaims.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      The so-called ADEA \"bypass\" provision does not aid the\nappellant's cause. As we explained in Rossiter v. Potter, 357 F.3d\n26 (1st Cir. 2004), there are certain conditions precedent attached\nto the use of that mechanism. See id. at 29. There is nothing in\nthe record that indicates the appellant satisfied these conditions,\nand she does not profess to have done so.\n\n                                 -9-\n\f",

An aggrieved employee (or, as in this case, an aggrieved former employee) has a choice between these two options&#8212;but she may not avail herself of both. <i>See</i> 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1614.302(b) (recognizing that once a formal appeal or complaint is filed in either forum, it \"shall be considered an election to proceed in that forum\"); <i>see also Castro v.

The lodging of either a formal appeal with the Board or a formal complaint with the agency demarcates the point of no return. <i>See</i> 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1614.302(b). From that point forward, the complainant must exhaust her claim in the chosen forum. <i>See Economou v. Caldera,</i> 286 F.3d 144, 149 (2d Cir.2002) (holding that a federal employee who had first filed a formal appeal with the Board was required to exhaust his administrative remedies in that forum and could not move at will to the other track).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission's regulations highlight the mutually exclusive nature of the two fora.

The appellant initially filed an appeal with the Board on October 10, 2001, and refiled it on February 10, 2002. By pressing that appeal, she made an election of remedies. Thus, when she subsequently attempted to switch horses in mid-stream and filed a formal EEO complaint with the agency on May 2, 2002&#8212;during the pendency of her appeal before the Board&#8212;that filing was a nullity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more would be to paint the lily. With two remedial paths open to her, the appellant chose to test the legitimacy of her termination by filing a formal appeal with the Board. The proceedings before the Board were in full flower when she reversed direction and submitted a formal EEO complaint. Having elected to travel one path (before the Board), she forfeited her right simultaneously to explore the alternative path (before the Commission).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the Board process that the appellant elected to pursue did not exclude her from all access to the courts. <i>See, e.g.,</i> 5 C.F.R. &#167; 1201.120 (providing for review of final Board decisions in the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit). Moreover, this is a mixed case, <i>see supra</i> note 1, so the appellant, qua complainant, could have filed a civil action in an appropriate federal district court within thirty days after receiving the Board's final decision. <i>See</i> 5 C.F.R. &#167; 1201.175. In either event, however, the complainant must wait until the Board takes final action before seeking judicial review. <i>See</i> 5 U.S.C. &#167; 7702(a)(3); 5 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1201.157, 1201.161(b).

She apparently envisioned her suit as an attempted extension of the EEO process (the record strongly suggests that conclusion and her brief on appeal confirms it). But as we have pointed out, the EEO forum was not open to her by the time that she belatedly tried to switch to that track.

First, the appellant has proffered no argument along those lines and, therefore, any such claim has been abandoned. <i>See United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (explaining that \"a litigant has an obligation to spell out [her] arguments squarely and distinctly, or else forever hold [her] peace\" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). Second, judicial review of that nature must await a final decision of the Board. <i>See</i> 5 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1201.157, 1201.161(b). In this instance, the appellant commenced her district court action on December 3, 2002&#8212;some nine months before the Board issued its final decision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we hold that this action was improvidently brought in the district court and was, therefore, appropriately dismissed. Given that holding, we need address neither the other grounds for dismissal limned by the magistrate judge nor the merits of the appellant's claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In such circumstances, an appeal filed with the Board is termed a \"mixed case,\" that is, an appeal alleging that \"an appealable agency action was effected, in whole or in part, because of discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, handicap, or age.\" 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1614.302(a)(2)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Because it is crystal clear that the Secretary is the only proper defendant,<i>see</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-16(c), we do not rehearse the roster of other defendants.

The appellant alleges that the controlling agency, the Department of Veterans Affairs (V.A.), created a hostile work environment and unlawfully discharged her based on her age (fifty-nine) and her deteriorating health. She also alleges that the V.A.'s stated justification for her ouster &#8212; an accumulation of warnings and admonishments related to workplace attendance and leave policies &#8212; resulted directly from arbitrary harassment by her supervisors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Initially, the appellant chose to challenge her discharge before the Merit Systems Protection Board (the Board). <i>See</i> 5 C.F.R. &#167; 1201.22. In this administrative appeal, filed on October 10, 2001, she charged that discriminatory motives had prompted her firing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> After she had asked to postpone an upcoming hearing due to her failing health, the Board dismissed her administrative appeal without prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 10, 2002, the appellant refiled her administrative appeal.

Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</i> No. NY-0752-02-0028-I-2 (M.S.P.B. June 12, 2002). The Board thereafter denied the appellant's subsequent petition for further review. <i>See Stoll-Roche v.

Undaunted, the appellant sought review of that decision before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (the Commission). The Commission affirmed the dismissal on the ground that the appellant had a proceeding pending before the Board. <i>See STOLL-ROCHE v. PRINCIPI,</i> E.E.O.C.

The court referred the matter to a magistrate judge, <i>see</i> Fed.

Given that holding, we need address neither the other grounds for dismissal limned by the magistrate judge nor the merits of the appellant's claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In such circumstances, an appeal filed with the Board is termed a \"mixed case,\" that is, an appeal alleging that \"an appealable agency action was effected, in whole or in part, because of discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, handicap, or age.\" 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1614.302(a)(2)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Because it is crystal clear that the Secretary is the only proper defendant,<i>see</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-16(c), we do not rehearse the roster of other defendants. Rather, we henceforth refer to the Secretary as if he were the sole defendant.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> To be sure, the two remedial paths do reach a crossroads. Upon the Board's issuance of a final decision, the appellant could have petitioned the Commission to review that decision<i>See</i> 5 U.S.C. &#167; 7702(b)(1) (providing for Commission review of certain Board decisions); <i>see also</i> 5 C.F.R. &#167; 1201.161; 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1614.303(a). Here, however, the appellant never pursued this possibility.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The so-called ADEA \"bypass\" provision does not aid the appellant's cause. As we explained in<i>Rossiter v. Potter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200832\"><a href=\"/opinion/200832/rossiter-v-potter/\"><span class=\"volume\">357</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2004), there are certain conditions precedent attached to the use of that mechanism. <i>See id.</i> at 29. There is nothing in the record that indicates the appellant satisfied these conditions, and she does not profess to have done so.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
