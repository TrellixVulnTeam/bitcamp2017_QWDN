Porter, Assistant Attorney General, with whom\nThomas F. Reilly, Attorney General, and Peter Sacks, Assistant\nAttorney General, were on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n\n                         June 24, 2005\n\f             TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.            Plaintiffs-appellants would\n\nlike to amend the Massachusetts Constitution to allow public\n\nfinancial    support   to    be    directed      toward    private,    religiously\n\naffiliated     schools.       Plaintiffs        attempted    to    propose    their\n\namendment through the Massachusetts initiative procedure, but two\n\ndistinct provisions of the Massachusetts Constitution prevented\n\ninitiatives on this subject.             They now challenge these subject-\n\nmatter exclusions from the initiative process on federal Free\n\nSpeech, Free Exercise, and Equal Protection grounds.                   In the end,\n\nplaintiffs' arguments fail, and although our analysis diverges at\n\npoints, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment.1\n\n                                    I.    Facts\n\n            Plaintiffs       are    parents       of   children       enrolled   in\n\nreligiously    affiliated      schools     who    sought    to    amend   Amendment\n\nArticle   18   of   the     Massachusetts        Constitution     (the    \"Anti-Aid\n\nAmendment\"), which prohibits public financial support for private\n\nprimary or secondary schools.2                 Mass. Const. amend. art. 18.\n\nArticle 48 of the Massachusetts Constitution provides that, in\n\n\n1\n   In sum, because we recognize the communicative aspect of the\ninitiative   process,   we    apply   intermediate   scrutiny   to\nMassachusetts' initiative exclusions, whereas the district court\napplied rational basis review.      We find that the exclusions\nnevertheless survive this heightened review. Our Free Exercise and\nEqual Protection Clause analyses elaborate on the district court's\nsimilar grounds for decision.\n2\n   The district court found that Plaintiffs lacked standing to\nchallenge the constitutionality of the Anti-Aid Amendment directly,\nbut that issue has not been raised on appeal.\n\n                                         -2-\n\faddition   to    the   amendment   procedure      available   to   the   state\n\nlegislature, the Constitution may also be amended by popular\n\ninitiative.      Mass. Const. amend. art. 48, pt. 1.          Following the\n\nrequired procedure, plaintiffs submitted an initiative petition,\n\nfor certification, to the Massachusetts Attorney General to modify\n\nthe Anti-Aid Amendment by adding a sentence stating that nothing in\n\nthe   Anti-Aid    Amendment    shall   prevent     the   Commonwealth     from\n\nproviding loans, grants, or tax benefits to students attending\n\nprivate schools, regardless of the schools' religious affiliation.\n\nThe Attorney General, however, denied certification of the proposed\n\ninitiative, because Article 48 prohibits amendment of the Anti-Aid\n\nAmendment by initiative (the \"Anti-Aid Exclusion\") and because the\n\npetition explicitly relates to \"religious institutions,\" another\n\nmatter expressly excluded from the initiative process by Article 48\n\n(the \"Religious Exclusion\").\n\n           Section     Two    of   Article   48     limits    Massachusetts'\n\ninitiative process by listing the \"Excluded Matters,\" which are not\n\nsubject to popular action by initiative, including, inter alia,\n\nappointment or compensation of judges; the powers, creation or\n\nabolition of the courts; and specific appropriation of state money.\n\nMass. Const. amend. art. 48, pt. 2, ยง 2.           The pertinent provision\n\nof Article 48, referred to as the Anti-Aid Exclusion, states that\n\n\"[n]either the eighteenth [Anti-Aid] amendment of the constitution\n\n. . . nor this provision for its protection, shall be the subject\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fof an initiative amendment,\" while the Religious Exclusion mandates\n\nthat \"[n]o measure that relates to religion, religious practices or\n\nreligious institutions . . . shall be proposed by an initiative\n\npetition.\" Id. Plaintiffs challenge the validity of both of these\n\nexclusions under the U.S. Constitution.\n\n                               II.    Analysis\n\n           A.    Free Speech Claim\n\n           The first issue before us is whether the Massachusetts\n\nConstitution's limitations on the initiative process violate the\n\nFirst   Amendment    free    speech   rights   of   prospective    initiative\n\nproponents.      Appellants argue that the exclusions to the state\n\ninitiative process, which prevent them from pursuing amendments\n\nregarding religion or state aid to private institutions, should be\n\nconsidered content-based restrictions on core political speech\n\nsubject to strict scrutiny.\n\n           The difficulty with the appellants' argument is that a\n\nstate initiative procedure, although it may involve speech, is also\n\na procedure for generating law, and is thus a process that the\n\nstate has an interest in regulating, apart from any regulation of\n\nthe speech involved in the initiative process. In other words, the\n\nchallenged      exclusions   constitute     regulations   \"aimed     at   non-\n\ncommunicative impact, but nonetheless having adverse effects on\n\ncommunicative      opportunity.\"        Laurence     H.   Tribe,     American\n\nConstitutional Law ยง 12-2 at 790 (2d ed. 1988).           See, e.g., United\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fStates v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 382 (1968) (rejecting draft card\n\nburner's claim that a statute prohibiting the destruction of draft\n\ncards violated his First Amendment rights, reasoning that the law\n\npunished him for the \"noncommunicative impact of his conduct,\"\n\nalthough the court recognized the symbolic value of burning a draft\n\ncard).     Unlike   regulations     that   are    \"aimed    at   communicative\n\nimpact,\" regulations that aim at preventing some harm independent\n\nof speech -- in this case, the use of the initiative process for\n\nthe passage of certain types of laws believed to be unsuited to\n\nthat process -- are not presumed unconstitutional, and are not\n\nsubjected to strict scrutiny.        Tribe, American Constitutional Law\n\nยง 12-2, at 790.     See, e.g., City of Erie v. Pap's A.M., 529 U.S.\n\n277, 291 (2000) (upholding a ban on nude dancing, because \"the\n\nordinance does not attempt to regulate the primary effects of the\n\nexpression, i.e., the effect on the audience of watching nude\n\nerotic dancing, but rather the secondary effects, such as the\n\nimpacts on public health, safety, and welfare,\" which are unrelated\n\nto expression). Regulations of this type are, at most, subject to\n\nintermediate scrutiny, under which they will be upheld if the\n\n\"harmful    consequences    of    this   particular   form       of   expressive\n\nbehavior, quite apart from any ideas it might convey, outweigh the\n\ngood.\" Tribe, American Constitutional Law ยง 12-2, 791. See, e.g.,\n\nGrayned    v.   Rockford,   408   U.S.   104,    115-16    (1972)     (upholding\n\nordinance barring noisy demonstrations near schools, because the\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fgovernment has sufficiently \"weighty reasons\" to restrict this type\n\nof expressive activity).               Applying this balancing, we uphold\n\nMassachusetts' exclusions to its initiative process for the reasons\n\nexplained below.\n\n            Before      arriving   at     this    explanation,         we    will   first\n\nexamine the arguments of the parties -- a task that is particularly\n\ndifficult in this case, because the parties have planted themselves\n\nfirmly at opposite poles, with plaintiffs arguing for strict\n\nscrutiny and Massachusetts arguing that only minimal rationality\n\nreview is appropriate.          In the end, we find that the law requires\n\nour analysis to proceed by a middle path in this apparent battle of\n\nabsolutes.         We   hold    that    Massachusetts'        exclusions        to    its\n\ninitiative process are narrowly drawn to further a significant\n\nstate interest, and thus survive intermediate scrutiny.\n\n             1.    The Communicative Value of the Initiative Process\n\n            The first step in our free speech analysis must be to\n\ndetermine     whether     citizens'       use     of    the   initiative        process\n\nconstitutes expressive conduct, permitting appellants to invoke the\n\nFirst   Amendment       to     challenge        the    Massachusetts         initiative\n\nexclusions.       See, e.g., Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 403 (1989)\n\n(citing Spence v. Washington, 418 U.S. 405, 409-11 (1974)).                          We do\n\nnot find that there is any serious debate as to this point.                             A\n\nstate   initiative      process    provides       a    uniquely   provocative         and\n\neffective    method      of    spurring    public      debate     on    an    issue    of\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fimportance to the proponents of the proposed initiative.                     The\n\nSupreme Court has made clear that the process involved in proposing\n\nlegislation by means of initiative involves core political speech.\n\nSee Meyer v. Grant, 486 U.S. 414 (1988) (overturning state's\n\nprohibition on using paid petition circulators); Buckley v. Am.\n\nConstitutional Law Found., Inc., 525 U.S. 182 (1999) (overturning\n\nvarious registration requirements for petition circulators).                  In\n\nMeyer, the Supreme Court recognized that \"the solicitation of\n\nsignatures for a petition involves protected speech.\"               486 U.S. at\n\n422, n.5.    Furthermore, the mere fact that plaintiffs \"remain free\n\nto employ other means to disseminate their ideas does not take\n\ntheir [preferred means of] speech through [the initiative process]\n\noutside the bounds of First Amendment protection.\"               Id. at 424.\n\nClearly, plaintiffs have been prevented from engaging in the sort\n\nof activity that implicates the First Amendment.             This conclusion,\n\nhowever, in no way ends our analysis; it only opens the door for us\n\nto   apply   constitutional    freedom      of   speech   principles    to   the\n\nlimitations Massachusetts places on its initiative process.\n\n             We   have   recognized    that      \"a   fine   line    separates\n\npermissible       regulation   of     state      election    processes       from\n\nimpermissible abridgement of First Amendment rights,\" Pรฉrez-Guzmรกn\n\nv. Gracia, 346 F.3d 229, 239 (1st Cir. 2003), and the same is true\n\nof regulation of state initiative procedures. In Pรฉrez-Guzmรกn, 346\n\nF.3d at 239-47, we invalidated Puerto Rico's requirement that\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fpetition signatures needed for registering a new political party to\n\nappear on the general election ballot be notarized, holding that it\n\nviolated the First Amendment of the federal Constitution.       In so\n\ndoing, we stated that \"we afford exacting scrutiny to severe\n\nrestrictions on ballot access.\"    Id. at 239.   We began our analysis\n\n\"with an assessment of the severity of the restriction,\" id., and\n\nhaving found it to be severe, we applied strict scrutiny, id. at\n\n243-44.\n\n          Plaintiffs argue that we should apply a similar two-step\n\nanalysis here.   However, plaintiffs' suggested      analysis makes an\n\nend-run around the most difficult part of their case. The district\n\ncourt in this case found that speech was only incidentally affected\n\nby the Massachusetts subject matter exclusions. Boyette v. Galvin,\n\n311 F. Supp. 2d 237, 240 (D. Mass. 2004).        Although the district\n\ncourt recognized that speech was involved, it concluded that the\n\nprimary goal of the exclusion was to prevent certain types of laws\n\nfrom being passed by means of the popular initiative process, and\n\nnot to limit what people could say or how they could say it.       Id.\n\nat 240-41. By contrast, the common denominator in Pรฉrez-Guzmรกn and\n\nother cases cited by plaintiffs is a direct restriction on the\n\ncommunicative aspect of the political process.       In Pรฉrez-Guzmรกn,\n\nlike in Meyer, the state regulated how people could promulgate\n\ntheir political views, in their respective attempts to put a new\n\nparty on the ballot, Pรฉrez-Guzmรกn, 346 F.3d at 230-31, and to\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fcirculate petitions for a proposed initiative,   Meyer, 486 U.S. at\n\n414. Strict scrutiny applied in these cases precisely because they\n\ninvolved direct regulation of the petition process itself.\n\n          We believe that the present case calls for a lower level\n\nof scrutiny.   We know of no general principle that, in addition to\n\nconstitutional amendment or lawmaking via a process instituted by\n\nthe state legislature, a state must provide an opportunity for its\n\nresidents to propose constitutional amendments or laws on all\n\nsubjects by means of an initiative process.    While we accept that\n\nuse of the initiative process can facilitate dissemination of\n\ninitiative proponents' views, the next step in a free speech\n\nanalysis is to determine whether or not the regulation in question\n\naims at regulating speech, or whether it has some other primary\n\nend, such that any effect on speech is purely incidental.     As we\n\nalluded to at the outset of this analysis, the First Amendment\n\ngenerally provides greater protection against laws that are \"aimed\n\nat communicative impact\" of the conduct they regulate than from\n\nlaws \"aimed at non-communicative impact, but nonetheless having\n\nadverse effects on communicative opportunity.\"      Tribe, American\n\nConstitutional Law ยง 12-2, at 790.      The primary goal of state\n\ninitiative procedures is to create an avenue of direct democracy\n\nwhereby citizens can participate in the generation of legislation\n\n-- that is, the act of creating law.   Laws such as those considered\n\nin Meyer and its progeny were aimed at directly regulating the\n\n\n                                -9-\n\fmeans that initiative proponents could use to reach their audience\n\nof potential petition signers.          In contrast, we find that subject\n\nmatter     exclusions    like    those       regulating      the    Massachusetts\n\ninitiative process aim at preventing the act of generating laws and\n\nconstitutional amendments about certain subjects by initiative.\n\nWhile they eliminate a valuable avenue of expression about those\n\nsubjects, the speech restriction is no more than an unintended\n\nside-effect of the exclusions.              It is because of this sometimes\n\noverlooked,      but     nevertheless          fundamental         principle    in\n\nconstitutional free speech doctrine that we must reject appellants'\n\nproposed    analysis.     We     turn    now    to    Massachusetts'      proposed\n\nalternative analysis.\n\n            2.   Massachusetts' Need to Regulate the Lawmaking Act\n\n            The communicative power of an initiative stems precisely\n\nfrom the fact that it is not just speech; it is a process that can\n\nlead to the creation of new laws or constitutional amendments.\n\nMassachusetts    urges   us     to   hold    that    its   restrictions    on   the\n\namendment process do not regulate speech qua speech, and thus do\n\nnot trigger strict scrutiny under the First Amendment.\n\n            Government actions that are aimed at some goal other than\n\nrestricting the conveyance of ideas are generally permissible, even\n\nif they incidentally inhibit free speech.                  See, e.g., Arcara v.\n\nCloud Books, Inc., 478 U.S. 697 (1986) (upholding the closure of an\n\nadult bookstore because prostitution was taking place on the\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fpremises).     Arcara is a prototypical example of this type of case,\n\nbecause the law in question only regulated a specific type of\n\nconduct   --    prostitution        --    which       did    not    implicate      speech.\n\nHowever, even a law seemingly entirely removed from speech can have\n\neffects on speech.           In Arcara, for example, the prohibition on\n\nprostitution resulted in the closure of a book store.                          Enforcement\n\nof a prohibition with such incidental effects does not, however,\n\nimplicate the First Amendment, and this type of law need only\n\nsurvive rationality review.\n\n             Plaintiffs      do    not        cite   to     any    precedent      for    the\n\nproposition     that,   under      the    Free       Speech      Clause   of    the     First\n\nAmendment, a state may not restrict the subjects that can be\n\naddressed    through    its       initiative         process.       The   D.C.     Circuit\n\naddressed a similar free speech challenge to a restriction on an\n\ninitiative process in the case of Marijuana Policy Project v.\n\nUnited States, 304 F.3d 82 (D.C. Cir. 2002).                        In that case, the\n\nD.C. Circuit held that a statute precluding the use of the D.C.\n\nballot    initiative     process         to    lower      drug     penalties      did    not\n\nunconstitutionally restrict free speech rights of medical marijuana\n\nadvocates, but only shifted the forum of debate from the District\n\nof Columbia to Congress.           Id. at 85-86.            The court explained that\n\n\"although      the   First    Amendment         protects      public      debate      about\n\nlegislation, it confers no right to legislate on a particular\n\n\n\n\n                                          -11-\n\fsubject.\"    Id. at 85.    Massachusetts argues that we should adopt\n\nthis reasoning to apply rational basis review in the instant case.\n\n            3. Regulating Conduct with Speech and Nonspeech Elements\n\n            We cannot agree with the D.C. Circuit's finding that\n\nsubject-matter exclusions from the initiative process \"restrict[]\n\nno speech,\" id. at 85, nor with its conclusion that this type of\n\nselective carve-out \"implicates no First Amendment concerns,\"      id.\n\nat 83.      For the same reasons, we also reject Massachusetts'\n\nargument that we should apply only rational basis review to the\n\nAnti-Aid and Religious Exclusions.       This case is not like Arcara,\n\nwhere the Supreme Court criticized the New York Court of Appeals\n\nfor having applied the analysis established in United States v.\n\nO'Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968), because the Court did not consider\n\nthe regulated conduct -- prostitution -- expressive.       See Arcara,\n\n478 U.S. at 705 (concluding that \"unlike the symbolic draft card\n\nburning in O'Brien, the sexual activity carried on in this case\n\nmanifests absolutely no element of protected expression\"). Rather,\n\nwe would continue along the analysis laid out by the Supreme Court\n\nin Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. at 403.          Having determined that\n\nMeyer, 486 U.S. at 422, indicates that a state initiative process\n\nmanifests elements of protected expression, under Johnson, \"we next\n\ndecide whether the State's regulation is related to the suppression\n\nof free expression.\"      491 U.S. at 403.   Here, as we have already\n\nexplained, the Massachusetts exclusions in question regulate which\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\ftypes of laws or amendments can be passed by initiative, without\n\nany reference to who may speak or what message they may convey.\n\nThus, because \"the State's regulation is not related to expression,\n\n. . . the less stringent standard [the Supreme Court] announced in\n\nUnited   States   v.   O'Brien   for    regulations     of    noncommunicative\n\nconduct controls.\"     Id. (citing O'Brien, 391 U.S. at 377 (finding\n\nthat, although burning a draft card can be expressive conduct, the\n\nfederal government's interest in preventing the destruction of\n\ndraft cards is sufficient to uphold defendant's conviction)).\n\n           The standard enunciated in O'Brien governs \"when 'speech'\n\nand 'nonspeech'    elements      are    combined   in   the   same   course   of\n\nconduct.\" O'Brien, 391 U.S. at 376.           See also Clark v. Community\n\nfor Creative Non-Violence, 468 U.S. 288 (1984) (applying O'Brien\n\nscrutiny to the application of a ban on camping on the Mall in\n\nWashington, D.C., to demonstrators who sought to sleep overnight\n\nthere to protest the plight of homeless people).               While we agree\n\nwith the D.C. Circuit that this type of regulation of a state\n\ninitiative process is not aimed at regulating speech, we cannot see\n\nhow, given the Supreme Court's analysis in Meyer, subject-matter\n\nexclusions from a state initiative process \"restrict[] no speech.\"\n\nMarijuana Policy Project, 304 F.3d at 85.           To the contrary, since\n\nexpression is affected by the regulations of the state initiative\n\nprocess, we apply the intermediate scrutiny standard set out in\n\nO'Brien.\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\f            4.    Applying O'Brien Scrutiny\n\n            Under the O'Brien standard, conduct combining \"speech\"\n\nand \"non-speech\" elements can be regulated if four requirements are\n\nmet: (1) the regulation \"is within the constitutional power of the\n\nGovernment;\"      (2)    \"it   furthers      an   important      or    substantial\n\ngovernmental interest;\" (3) \"the governmental interest is unrelated\n\nto the suppression of free expression;\" and (4) \"the incidental\n\nrestriction on alleged First Amendment freedoms is no greater than\n\nis essential to the furtherance of that interest.\"                    O'Brien, 391\n\nU.S. at 377.     We have no difficulty finding that the Massachusetts\n\nexclusions meet the second requirement, as Massachusetts certainly\n\nhas a substantial interest in maintaining the proper balance\n\nbetween promoting free exercise and preventing state establishment\n\nof   religion.      Neither    do   we   doubt    that    Massachusetts       has    a\n\nsubstantial interest in restricting the means by which these\n\nfundamental rights can be changed. We have already stated that the\n\nexclusions   aim    at   preventing      certain    uses    of   the    initiative\n\nprocess, not at stemming expression, and thus meet the third\n\nO'Brien requirement.\n\n            As for the first requirement, that the regulation be\n\nwithin the constitutional power of the government, we find that the\n\nonly   serious,    non-speech-related        constitutional       challenges        to\n\nMassachusetts' power to regulate the subjects that may be reached\n\nby   its   initiative     process    are   the     Free    Exercise     and   Equal\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fProtection arguments, which we reject in this opinion.                  Having now\n\nconcluded     that       Massachusetts'       interest      in    protecting      the\n\nfundamental       free    exercise    and    freedom    from     state-established\n\nreligion is substantial and its method otherwise constitutionally\n\npermissible, we finally consider the fourth O'Brien requirement:\n\nwhether     the    incidental     restrictions         on   would-be   initiative\n\nproponents' First Amendment freedoms are greater than essential to\n\nthe furtherance of that interest.              Since we see no other way in\n\nwhich Massachusetts could achieve its interest in safeguarding\n\nthese   fundamental        freedoms    in    its   Constitution      from    popular\n\ninitiative, we recognize that the restriction on speech is no more\n\nthan is essential.         Thus, we conclude that Massachusetts' Anti-Aid\n\nand Religious Exclusions do not violate the First Amendment free\n\nspeech guarantee.\n\n            B.     Free Exercise Claim\n\n            We now consider whether the Religious Exclusion violates\n\nthe Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.3                           The Free\n\nExercise    Clause       guarantees   that     \"Congress    shall    make    no   law\n\nrespecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free\n\nexercise thereof,\" U.S. Const. amend. I (emphasis added), and it\n\nhas been applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nSee Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 303 (1940).\n\n\n\n3\n   Appellants do not challenge the Anti-Aid Exclusion under the\nFree Exercise Clause.\n\n                                        -15-\n\f            The protections provided by the Free Exercise Clause may\n\nbe broken down into a number of conceptual categories, none of\n\nwhich are    implicated      by   the   Religious    Exclusion.         First   and\n\nforemost, the Free Exercise Clause entails an absolute prohibition\n\non government infringement on the \"freedom to believe.\" Torcaso v.\n\nWatkins, 367 U.S. 488, 492-93 (1961).             Because the prohibition is\n\nabsolute, laws which infringe on individuals' freedom of belief are\n\nper se unconstitutional.          Id. (refusing to consider the state's\n\nasserted justifications for a law that infringed on citizens'\n\nfreedom of belief); see also West Virginia State Bd. of Educ. v.\n\nBarnette, 319 U.S. 624 (1943) (holding that a state could not\n\ncompel students in public schools to salute the flag, where their\n\nreligion forbade it). However, that prohibition is inapposite here\n\nbecause the Religious Exclusion does not hinge on the religious\n\nbeliefs of initiative proponents.              See McDaniel v. Paty, 435 U.S.\n\n618, 627 (1978) (finding that a Tennessee law that precluded\n\nministers from eligibility as constitutional convention delegates\n\ndid   not   infringe    on     freedom     of     belief,     but     nevertheless\n\ninvalidating it under strict scrutiny).\n\n            In McDaniel v. Paty, the Supreme Court examined a state\n\nlaw   preventing   a   minister     from       serving   as   a     constitutional\n\nconvention delegate under strict scrutiny, because although it did\n\nnot directly burden his religious beliefs, it directly burdened his\n\nreligious \"status, acts, and conduct.\"             McDaniel, 435 U.S. at 626-\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\f27.    This protection is related to, though distinct from, the per\n\nse    prohibition   on   laws    infringing    on   belief.     Arguing     from\n\nMcDaniel, plaintiffs maintain that a state violates the Free\n\nExercise Clause when it creates a general political process, but\n\nexcludes some from access to that process on the basis of religion.\n\nHowever, plaintiffs fail to explain how this proposition applies to\n\ntheir case. The Religious Exclusion prevents anyone from proposing\n\nnew laws or constitutional amendments relating to religion through\n\nthe initiative process.         It does not exclude religious people, or\n\npeople of a certain religion, from proposing laws or amendments.\n\nIn other words, a religious individual of any particular faith,\n\nlike any other citizen, can propose a new law or amendment on any\n\nsubject that is open to amendment by initiative.\n\n            Moreover,    the    Religious     Exclusion   we   are    asked    to\n\nscrutinize does not distinguish based on religious status.4                 Like\n\nthe scholarship program at issue in Locke v. Davey, the Religious\n\nExclusion does not deny plaintiffs \"the right to participate in the\n\npolitical    affairs     of     the   community,\"      540     U.S.    at     720\n\n\n4\n   Plaintiffs claim that McDaniel stands for the proposition that\nopponents of a law need not show that the law imposes a particular\nburden on religious belief or practice. Although this may be true\nas a general proposition, this leaves plaintiffs to argue that they\nare being discriminated against on the basis of religious \"status,\"\nas was the case in McDaniel. 435 U.S. at 626-27 (finding violation\nof plaintiff's right to Free Exercise of religion where his status\nas a minister resulted in discrimination).     However, plaintiffs\nmake no headway with this argument because they cannot show that\nthe Massachusetts Religious Exclusion treats people differently\nbased on their religious \"status.\"\n\n                                      -17-\n\f(distinguishing Locke from McDaniel, 435 U.S. 618); nor does it\n\n\"require[] [plaintiffs] to choose between their religious beliefs\n\nand receiving a government benefit.\" Id. at 720-21 (distinguishing\n\nHobbie v. Unemployment Appeals Comm'n of Fla., 480 U.S. 136 (1987);\n\nThomas v. Review Bd. of Ind. Employment Security Div., 450 U.S. 707\n\n(1981); Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398 (1963)).    The exclusion\n\napplies equally to measures proposed by any group or individual,\n\nregardless of their religious affiliation or lack thereof.\n\n          Having concluded that the Religious Exclusion does not\n\ndiscriminate on the basis of religious belief or status, we also\n\nbriefly note that plaintiffs make no colorable argument that the\n\nexclusion prohibits any religious act or conduct. It does not, for\n\nexample, preclude performing rites required by their religion, see\n\nChurch of the Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520,\n\n533 (1993) (outlawing animal sacrifice central to the Santerรญa\n\nreligion), or single out their religion's method of worship, see\n\nFowler v. Rhode Island, 345 U.S. 67 (1953) (preventing Jehovah's\n\nWitnesses from meeting in public parks while other denominations\n\nwere allowed to hold services).   The Supreme Court has stated its\n\nreluctance to strike down \"legislation which imposes only an\n\nindirect burden on the exercise of religion, i.e., legislation\n\nwhich does not make unlawful the religious practice itself.\"\n\nBraunfeld v. Brown, 366 U.S. 599, 606 (1961).       Certainly, the\n\namendments that plaintiffs want to propose may be motivated by\n\n\n                               -18-\n\ftheir religious beliefs, but they do not claim that working to pass\n\nthose amendments is an aspect of practicing their religion.\n\n            Finally,   plaintiffs     ask    us    to    consider    whether    the\n\npassage of the Religious Exclusion was motivated by animus toward\n\nreligion. The Supreme Court has considered the existence of animus\n\nmotivating a law's proponents when determining whether the law\n\nviolates the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.                      See,\n\ne.g., Locke, 540 U.S. at 725 (finding nothing in the history, text\n\nor application of the Washington scholarship program in question\n\n\"that suggests animus towards religion\").                In the Establishment\n\nClause context, the Supreme Court has \"often stated the principle\n\nthat the First Amendment forbids an official purpose to disapprove\n\nof a particular religion or of religion in general.\"                Church of the\n\nLukumi, 508 U.S. at 532 (noting that \"[t]hese cases, however, for\n\nthe most part have addressed governmental efforts to benefit\n\nreligion or particular religions, and so have dealt with a question\n\ndifferent, at least in its formulation and emphasis, from the issue\n\nhere\"). Although plaintiffs present significant evidence of animus\n\nagainst Catholics in Massachusetts in 1855 when the Anti-Aid\n\nAmendment was passed, they fail to show that religious animus\n\nmotivated     the   passage   of   the   Religious        Exclusion     in     1918.\n\nPlaintiffs rely heavily on one statement made by the Religious\n\nExclusion's     sponsor,   indicating       that    he    would     \"protect    the\n\ninitiative    and   referendum     against   the    religious       fanatics     and\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\fagainst the professional religionists.\" However, we need not reach\n\nthe question of whether this type of fervor against religiously\n\nmotivated political action would require that the amendment be\n\nstruck down, because plaintiffs present no evidence that the other\n\nmembers of the Constitutional Convention of 1917-1918 acted from\n\nsimilar motivations.     Given the wide margin by which the Religious\n\nExclusion passed, and the significant Catholic representation at\n\nthe Convention, we see no evidence that animus against religion was\n\na motivating factor behind the Exclusion's passage.\n\n             Furthermore, plaintiffs cite to no case in which evidence\n\nof animus toward religion was itself sufficient to invalidate a\n\ngovernment action, without the animus being tied to some resulting\n\ninfringement on freedom of belief or on religious status, acts or\n\nconduct.     While we must apply strict scrutiny when \"the object of\n\na law is to infringe upon or restrict practices because of their\n\nreligious motivation,\" plaintiffs here have not shown that the\n\nReligious Exclusion results in any restriction of their religious\n\npractices.     Id. at 533 (citing Employment Div., Dept. of Human\n\nResources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 878-79 (1990)) (emphasis\n\nadded) (considering evidence of animus toward the Santerรญa religion\n\nwhere the ordinance prohibiting ritual slaughter of animals did\n\nnot, on its face, target the Santerรญa religion, but effectively\n\noutlawed one of the religion's \"principal forms of devotion\").\n\n\n\n\n                                  -20-\n\f           C.    Equal Protection\n\n           Plaintiffs also argue that the Massachusetts Exclusions\n\nviolate the protections afforded by the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nU.S. Const. amend. XIV.              Plaintiffs argue that the Religious\n\nExclusion violates equal protection guarantees because it infringes\n\non the fundamental right to religious free exercise, disadvantages\n\na suspect class, and fails the more searching rational basis review\n\nrequired in Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620 (1996).                        They also\n\nchallenge the Anti-Aid Exclusion under a suspect classification\n\ntheory and a disparate impact theory. Because of the complexity of\n\nthe various equal protection arguments presented, we will address\n\nthe arguments one at a time, to the extent that is possible.                     In\n\nthe end, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment\n\nagainst plaintiffs' equal protection claims.\n\n           1. Alleged Violation of the Equal Protection Fundamental\n           Right to Free Exercise of Religion\n\n           Before    moving     to    what    we   see   as   the    substance   of\n\nplaintiffs'     equal     protection    claims,     we   first      address   their\n\nargument   that     the    Massachusetts       Exclusions      restricts      their\n\nfundamental     right     to   free    exercise     of   religion.       Where    a\n\nplaintiff's First Amendment Free Exercise claim has failed, the\n\nSupreme Court has applied only rational basis scrutiny in its\n\nsubsequent review of an equal protection fundamental right to\n\nreligious free exercise claim based on the same facts.                 Locke, 540\n\nU.S. at 721, n.3 (citing Johnson v. Robison, 415 U.S. 361, 375, n.\n\n                                       -21-\n\f14, (1974)).5   Because we held, above, that the Religious Exclusion\n\ndoes not violate the Free Exercise Clause, we apply rational basis\n\nscrutiny to the fundamental rights based claim that this exclusion\n\nviolates equal protection.       For the reasons stated throughout this\n\nopinion, we find that the Massachusetts Exclusions pass such\n\nreview.\n\n            2.   Plaintiffs' Claim that the Religious and Anti-Aid\n            Exclusions Implicate a Suspect Classification\n\n            The central equal protection issue presented is whether\n\nthe   Massachusetts   Religious    Exclusion     and   Anti-Aid         Exclusion\n\nimpermissibly distort the political process to the disadvantage of\n\nreligious   individuals.     Because      we   find    that   the       Religious\n\nExclusion    does   not   draw    distinctions    based       on    a     suspect\n\n\n\n\n5\n   In Locke, the Court quickly dismissed Davey's equal protection\nclaims. The Court explained that \"[b]ecause we hold . . . that the\nprogram is not a violation of the Free Exercise Clause, . . . we\napply rational-basis scrutiny to his equal protection claims.\"\nLocke, 540 U.S. at 721, n.3. It bears clarifying that we do not\nread this statement to be a blanket rule that where a Free Exercise\nClaim fails, all equal protection claims based on the same facts\nmust also fail. Looking back to Johnson v. Robinson, we interpret\nthis line of Supreme Court cases to apply only to the extent that\nthe related equal protection claims are based on a theory that the\nlaw or governmental action in question \"interferes with the\nfundamental constitutional right to the free exercise of religion.\"\nJohnson, 415 U.S. at 375, n.14. Other types of equal protection\nclaims may have independent force, and must be considered\naccordingly.   See id. (finding that only rational basis review\ncould be applied to plaintiff's equal protection claim insofar as\nit was based on interference with the fundamental right to freedom\nof religion, and then separately, though briefly, considering the\nmerits of plaintiff's claim that \"conscientious objectors are a\nsuspect class deserving special judicial protection\").\n\n                                   -22-\n\fclassification,     we    hold    that    it     does    not   violate      the    Equal\n\nProtection Clause.\n\n            Plaintiffs claim that the Religious Exclusion and Anti-\n\nAid Exclusion draw distinctions on the basis of religion, which\n\nthey argue is a suspect classification for purposes of equal\n\nprotection   analysis.6          However,       even    assuming     that    religious\n\nclassification should be treated as suspect, we do not see how the\n\nReligious Exclusion and Anti-Aid Exclusion draw distinctions among\n\nMassachusetts citizens based on a suspect classification.                            The\n\nReligious Exclusion prohibits initiative petitions that concern\n\n\"religion, religious practices or religious institutions.\"                           The\n\nAnti-Aid Exclusion precludes amendment by initiative of the Anti-\n\nAid Amendment, which, in addition to containing Massachusetts' free\n\nexercise clause, prevents state funding for private institutions.\n\nOn their face, the Exclusions simply carve out particular subject\n\nmatters from the initiative process. They do not require different\n\ntreatment of    any      class   of   people      because      of   their    religious\n\nbeliefs. They do not give preferential treatment to any particular\n\nreligion.     See   Larson       v.   Valente,     456    U.S.      228,    246   (1982)\n\n\n\n6\n   But see Tribe, American Constitutional Law ยง 16-13 at 1465 (2d\ned. 1988) (\"Thus far, the cases have limited such strict scrutiny\nto instances of prejudice operating to the detriment of racial or\nancestral groups.\"); see also San Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist. v.\nRodrรญguez, 411 U.S. 1, 61 (1973) (naming race as the prime example\nof a suspect classification, and listing national origin, alienage,\nindigency and illegitimacy -- but not religion -- as other\nclassifications that are sometimes considered suspect).\n\n                                         -23-\n\f(holding, on First Amendment grounds, that \"a state law granting a\n\ndenominational   preference\"     must    be   treated   as   suspect,    and\n\nsubjected to strict scrutiny).        In short, this is not the classic\n\nviolation of equal protection in which a law creates different\n\nrules for    distinct   groups   of   individuals   based    on   a   suspect\n\nclassification. See, e.g., Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U.S. 303\n\n(1879) (overturning state law which limited jury service to white\n\nmen only).\n\n            The Supreme Court has, nevertheless, sometimes struck\n\ndown facially neutral laws, which it recognized were crafted to\n\navoid facial discrimination.      See, e.g., Hunter v. Erickson, 393\n\nU.S. 385, 387-91 (1969) (invalidating an amendment to the Akron,\n\nOhio city charter, which, in addition to the usual vote by the city\n\ncouncil, required approval by a majority of the city's voters for\n\nany ordinance regulating real estate transactions \"on the basis of\n\nrace, color, religion, national origin or ancestry,\" even though\n\nthe law \"on its face treats [African-American] and white, Jew and\n\ngentile in an identical manner\"); Washington v. Seattle School\n\nDist. No. 1, 458 U.S. 457 (1982) (striking down a Washington\n\ninitiative that prohibited school boards from requiring children to\n\nbe bused to more distant public schools, while at the same time\n\nmaking exceptions for every imaginable impetus for busing other\n\nthan racial integration). Unlike the Massachusetts Exclusions, the\n\nlaw in Hunter evinces a clear, solely detrimental effect on a\n\n\n                                  -24-\n\fsuspect class.    In Hunter, the law's one obvious result was to make\n\nit more difficult to pass laws prohibiting racial discrimination.\n\nHunter, 393 U.S. at 391.         Similarly, in Washington, although the\n\ninitiative did not say so on its face, children could be bused to\n\na more distant school for virtually any reason except racial\n\nintegration.     458 U.S. at 471.        In contrast, the Massachusetts\n\nReligious Exclusion prevents both initiatives that would disfavor\n\nas well as those that might benefit religion, and the Anti-Aid\n\nExclusion, in addition to preventing amendment of the clause\n\nprecluding     funding   to    private      institutions,   also   prohibits\n\namendment of Massachusetts' free exercise clause.           Unlike the laws\n\ninvalidated in Hunter and Washington, it is undeniable that the\n\nMassachusetts Exclusions both hinder and help the causes of the\n\nalleged suspect class.7\n\n          Certainly any form of invidious discrimination because of\n\nreligion is forbidden.        But \"the Establishment Clause and the Free\n\nExercise Clause[] are frequently in tension.\"           Locke, 540 U.S. at\n\n\n\n7\n  Moreover, in both Hunter and Washington, the Supreme Court found\nthat the laws were purposely aimed solely at unlawful goals.\nWashington, 458 U.S. at 471 (noting that neither the initiative's\nsponsors, nor the lower courts, had any difficulty perceiving the\nracial aim of the initiative); Hunter, 393 U.S. at 392 (recognizing\nAkron's decision to \"move slowly in the delicate area of race\nrelations\" as a euphemism for placing an obstacle in the path of\nprogress against racial discrimination). We address the question\nof discriminatory purpose below in considering plaintiffs'\ndisparate impact argument. We conclude that plaintiffs failed to\npresent evidence sufficient to prove a uniquely discriminatory\npurpose in this case.\n\n                                     -25-\n\f718. States may properly refuse to enact laws that they reasonably\n\nbelieve may tend to establish religion. While the free exercise of\n\nreligion is guaranteed, state support of religion is, in general,\n\ndisfavored.        And we know of no constitutional principle that\n\nprevents a state from determining that sensitive measures that\n\nrelate to religion, religious practices, or religious institutions\n\nshould not be made or initiated by the public initiative process\n\nbut rather only via the legislature.              A state might fear that such\n\nmeasures, if presented as public referenda, might be more likely to\n\nfuel   religious        strife   or   to    result    in   enactments   unfair   to\n\nreligious        (or    non-religious)        minorities.          Bearing    these\n\ndistinctions in mind, we are disinclined to extend the race-based\n\nHunter and Washington lines of cases to this context, which so\n\nclosely mirrors the mandates found in our federal Establishment\n\nClause and Free Exercise Clause.\n\n            3.     Plaintiffs Have Not Shown Discriminatory Intent\n\n            Plaintiffs further argue that the Anti-Aid Exclusion\n\nviolates the Equal Protection Clause on a disparate impact theory.\n\nHowever, this argument fails because plaintiffs have not shown a\n\ndiscriminatory purpose behind the exclusion.                  \"[A] law, neutral on\n\nits face and serving ends otherwise within the power of government\n\nto pursue,\" is not invalid under the Equal Protection Clause simply\n\nbecause     it    may    disproportionately          affect    a   suspect   class.\n\nWashington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 242 (1976). \"An unwavering line\n\n\n                                           -26-\n\fof cases from [the Supreme Court] holds that a violation of the\n\nEqual   Protection   Clause     requires   state   action   motivated    by\n\ndiscriminatory intent; the disproportionate effects of state action\n\nare not sufficient to establish such a violation.\"             Hernรกndez v.\n\nNew York, 500 U.S. 352, 372-73 (1991). Plaintiffs present evidence\n\nthat widespread anti-Catholic prejudice was a motivating factor\n\nbehind passage of the original Anti-Aid Amendment in 1855, a fact\n\nwhich defendants do not dispute.       However, the Anti-Aid Amendment\n\nwas largely overhauled in 1917, with the support of 85 of the 94\n\nCatholic delegates to the Constitutional Convention, and soon\n\nafterwards, the Anti-Aid Exclusion was passed with similarly broad\n\nsupport.   No evidence has been offered that the exclusion was\n\nmotivated by the same Anti-Catholic animus that impelled the\n\npassage of the original Anti-Aid Amendment.        Plaintiffs cannot mix\n\nand match the intent behind one amendment and place it with the\n\nimpact of a later, distinct amendment.       Thus, without reaching the\n\nquestion of whether the Anti-Aid Exclusion has a disparate effect\n\non religious individuals, we reject plaintiffs' equal protection\n\ndisparate impact argument because plaintiffs fail to show the\n\nrequired discriminatory intent.\n\n           4.   Rational Basis Review Under Romer v. Evans\n\n           Having    rejected     plaintiffs'      arguments     that   the\n\nMassachusetts Exclusions should be subjected to strict scrutiny, we\n\nconclude by considering whether the exclusions survive rational\n\n\n                                   -27-\n\fbasis review.    \"[I]f a law neither burdens a fundamental right nor\n\ntargets   a   suspect    class,      we   will      uphold   the     legislative\n\nclassification so long as it bears a rational relation to some\n\nlegitimate    end.\"     Romer   v.   Evans,    517    U.S.   620,    631    (1996)\n\n(striking down an amendment to the Colorado Constitution that would\n\nhave precluded protection from discrimination on the basis of\n\nsexual orientation as failing rational basis review).                      In this\n\ncase, we have no difficulty finding that Massachusetts' goal of\n\npreventing the establishment of religion is a legitimate one.\n\nAdditionally, the chosen means clearly bear a rational relation to\n\nthat end.     Thus, the instant case is easily distinguished from\n\nRomer, where the Court found that passage of the Colorado amendment\n\ncould only be explained by \"'a bare . . . desire to harm a\n\npolitically     unpopular   group,'\"        which    \"'cannot      constitute    a\n\nlegitimate governmental interest.'\"           Id. at 634 (quoting Dep't of\n\nAgric. v. Moreno, 413 U.S. 528, 534 (1973)).\n\n                            III.     Conclusion\n\n            For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the district\n\ncourt is affirmed.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -28-\n\f",

Plaintiffs attempted to propose their amendment through the Massachusetts initiative procedure, but two distinct provisions of the Massachusetts Constitution prevented initiatives on this subject. They now challenge these subject-matter exclusions from the initiative process on federal Free Speech, Free Exercise, and Equal Protection grounds. In the end, plaintiffs' arguments fail, and although our analysis diverges at points, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Facts</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs are parents of children enrolled in religiously affiliated schools who sought to amend Amendment Article 18 of the Massachusetts Constitution (the \"Anti-Aid Amendment\"), which prohibits public financial support for private primary or secondary schools.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Mass. Const. amend. art. 18. Article 48 of the Massachusetts Constitution provides that, in addition to the amendment procedure available to the state legislature, the Constitution may also be amended by popular initiative. Mass. Const. amend. art. 48, pt. 1. Following the required procedure, plaintiffs submitted an initiative petition, for certification, to the Massachusetts Attorney General to modify the Anti-Aid Amendment by adding a sentence stating that nothing in the Anti-Aid Amendment shall prevent the Commonwealth from providing loans, grants, or tax benefits to students attending private schools, regardless of the schools' religious affiliation. The Attorney General, however, denied certification of the proposed initiative, because Article 48 prohibits amendment of the Anti-Aid Amendment by initiative (the \"Anti-Aid Exclusion\") and because the petition explicitly relates to \"religious institutions,\" another matter expressly excluded from the initiative process by Article 48 (the \"Religious Exclusion\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section Two of Article 48 limits Massachusetts' initiative process by listing the \"Excluded Matters,\" which are not subject to popular action by initiative, including, <i>inter alia,</i> appointment or compensation of judges; the powers, creation or abolition of the courts; and specific appropriation of state money. Mass. Const. amend. art. 48, pt. 2, &#167; 2. The pertinent provision of Article 48, referred to as the Anti-Aid Exclusion, states that \"[n]either the eighteenth [Anti-Aid] amendment of the constitution... nor this provision for its protection, shall be the subject of an initiative amendment,\" while the Religious Exclusion mandates that \"[n]o measure that relates to religion, religious practices or religious institutions... shall be proposed by an initiative petition.\" <i>Id.</i> Plaintiffs challenge the validity of both of these exclusions under the U.S. Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Analysis</i></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Free Speech Claim</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first issue before us is whether the Massachusetts Constitution's limitations on the initiative process violate the First Amendment free speech rights of prospective initiative proponents. Appellants argue that the exclusions to the state initiative process, which prevent them from pursuing amendments regarding religion or state aid to private institutions, should be considered content-based restrictions on core political speech subject to strict scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difficulty with the appellants' argument is that a state initiative procedure, although it may involve speech, is also a procedure for generating law, and is thus a process that the state has an interest in regulating, apart from any regulation of the speech involved in the initiative process. In other words, the challenged exclusions constitute regulations \"<i>aimed at non-communicative impact,</i> but nonetheless having adverse effects on communicative opportunity.\" Laurence H. Tribe, <i>American Constitutional Law</i> &#167; 12-2 at 790 (2d ed.1988). <i>See, e.g., United States v. O'Brien,</i> 391 U.S. 367, 382, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968) (rejecting draft card burner's claim that a statute prohibiting the destruction of draft cards violated his First Amendment rights, reasoning that the law punished him for the \"noncommunicative impact of his conduct,\" although the court recognized the symbolic value of burning a draft card). Unlike regulations that are \"<i>aimed at communicative impact,</i>\" regulations that aim at preventing some harm independent of speech&#8212;in this case, the use of the initiative process for the passage of certain types of laws believed to be unsuited to that process&#8212;are not presumed unconstitutional, and are not subjected to strict scrutiny. Tribe, <i>American Constitutional Law</i> &#167; 12-2, at 790. <i>See, e.g., City of Erie v. Pap's A.M.,</i> 529 U.S. 277, 291, 120 S.Ct. 1382, 146 L.Ed.2d 265 (2000) (upholding a ban on nude dancing, because \"the ordinance does not attempt to regulate the primary effects of the expression, i.e., the effect on the audience of watching nude erotic dancing, but rather the secondary effects, such as the impacts on public health, safety, and welfare,\" which are unrelated to expression). Regulations of this type are, at most, subject to intermediate scrutiny, under which they will be upheld if the \"harmful consequences of this particular form of expressive behavior, quite apart from any ideas it might convey, outweigh the good.\" Tribe, <i>American Constitutional Law</i> &#167; 12-2, 791. <i>See, e.g., Grayned v. Rockford,</i> 408 U.S. 104, 115-16, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972) (upholding ordinance barring noisy demonstrations near schools, because the government has sufficiently \"weighty reasons\" to restrict this type of expressive activity). Applying this balancing, we uphold Massachusetts' exclusions to its initiative process for the reasons explained below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before arriving at this explanation, we will first examine the arguments of the parties&#8212;a task that is particularly difficult in this case, because the parties have planted themselves firmly at opposite poles, with plaintiffs arguing for strict scrutiny and Massachusetts arguing that only minimal rationality review is appropriate. In the end, we find that the law requires our analysis to proceed by a middle path in this apparent battle of absolutes. We hold that Massachusetts' exclusions to its initiative process are narrowly drawn to further a significant state interest, and thus survive intermediate scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>The Communicative Value of the Initiative Process</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first step in our free speech analysis must be to determine whether citizens' use of the initiative process constitutes expressive conduct, permitting appellants to invoke the First Amendment to challenge the Massachusetts initiative exclusions. <i>See, e.g., Texas v. Johnson,</i> 491 U.S. 397, 403, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 105 L.Ed.2d 342 (1989) (citing <i>Spence v. Washington,</i> 418 U.S. 405, 409-11, 94 S.Ct. 2727, 41 L.Ed.2d 842 (1974)). We do not find that there is any serious debate as to this point. A state initiative process provides a uniquely provocative and effective method of spurring public debate on an issue of importance to the proponents of the proposed initiative. The Supreme Court has made clear that the process involved in proposing legislation by means of initiative involves core political speech. <i>See Meyer v. Grant,</i> 486 U.S. 414, 108 S.Ct. 1886, 100 L.Ed.2d 425 (1988) (overturning state's prohibition on using paid petition circulators); <i>Buckley v. Am. Constitutional Law Found., Inc.,</i> 525 U.S. 182, 119 S.Ct. 636, 142 L.Ed.2d 599 (1999) (overturning various registration requirements for petition circulators). In <i>Meyer,</i> the Supreme Court recognized that \"the solicitation of signatures for a petition involves protected speech.\" 486 U.S. at 422, n. 5, 108 S.Ct. 1886. Furthermore, the mere fact that plaintiffs \"remain free to employ other means to disseminate their ideas does not take their [preferred means of] speech through [the initiative process] outside the bounds of First Amendment protection.\" <i>Id.</i> at 424, 108 S.Ct. 1886. Clearly, plaintiffs have been prevented from engaging in the sort of activity that implicates the First Amendment. This conclusion, however, in no way ends our analysis; it only opens the door for us to apply constitutional freedom of speech principles to the limitations Massachusetts places on its initiative process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have recognized that \"a fine line separates permissible regulation of state election processes from impermissible abridgement of First Amendment rights,\" <i>P&#233;rez-Guzm&#225;n v. Gracia,</i> 346 F.3d 229, 239 (1st Cir.2003), and the same is true of regulation of state initiative procedures. In <i>P&#233;rez-Guzm&#225;n,</i> 346 F.3d at 239-47, we invalidated Puerto Rico's requirement that petition signatures needed for registering a new political party to appear on the general election ballot be notarized, holding that it violated the First Amendment of the federal Constitution. In so doing, we stated that \"we afford exacting scrutiny to severe restrictions on ballot access.\" <i>Id.</i> at 239. We began our analysis \"with an assessment of the severity of the restriction,\" <i>id.,</i> and having found it to be severe, we applied strict scrutiny, <i>id.</i> at 243-44.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs argue that we should apply a similar two-step analysis here. However, plaintiffs' suggested analysis makes an end-run around the most difficult part of their case. The district court in this case found that speech was only incidentally affected by the Massachusetts subject matter exclusions. <i>Boyette v. Galvin,</i> 311 F.Supp.2d 237, 240 (D.Mass.2004). Although the district court recognized that speech was involved, it concluded that the primary goal of the exclusion was to prevent certain types of laws from being passed by means of the popular initiative process, and not to limit <i>what</i> people could say or <i>how</i> they could say it. <i>Id.</i> at 240-41. By contrast, the common denominator in <i>P&#233;rez-Guzm&#225;n</i> and other cases cited by plaintiffs is a direct restriction on the communicative aspect of the political process. In <i>P&#233;rez-Guzm&#225;n,</i> like in <i>Meyer,</i> the state regulated <i>how</i> people could promulgate their political views, in their respective attempts to put a new party on the ballot, <i>P&#233;rez-Guzm&#225;n,</i> 346 F.3d at 230-31, and to circulate petitions for a proposed initiative, <i>Meyer,</i> 486 U.S. at 414, 108 S.Ct. 1886. Strict scrutiny applied in these cases precisely because they involved direct regulation of the petition <i>process</i> itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe that the present case calls for a lower level of scrutiny. We know of no general principle that, in addition to constitutional amendment or lawmaking via a process instituted by the state legislature, a state must provide an opportunity for its residents to propose constitutional amendments or laws on all subjects by means of an initiative process. While we accept that use of the initiative process can facilitate dissemination of initiative proponents' views, the next step in a free speech analysis is to determine whether or not the regulation in question aims at regulating speech, or whether it has some other primary end, such that any effect on speech is purely incidental. As we alluded to at the outset of this analysis, the First Amendment generally provides greater protection against laws that are \"aimed at communicative impact\" of the conduct they regulate than from laws \"aimed at non-communicative impact, but nonetheless having adverse effects on communicative opportunity.\" Tribe, <i>American Constitutional Law</i> &#167; 12-2, at 790. The primary goal of state initiative procedures is to create an avenue of direct democracy whereby citizens can participate in the generation of legislation&#8212;that is, the <i>act</i> of creating law. Laws such as those considered in <i>Meyer</i> and its progeny were aimed at directly regulating the <i>means</i> that initiative proponents could use to reach their audience of potential petition signers. In contrast, we find that subject matter exclusions like those regulating the Massachusetts initiative process aim at preventing the <i>act</i> of generating laws and constitutional amendments about certain subjects by initiative. While they eliminate a valuable avenue of expression about those subjects, the speech restriction is no more than an unintended side-effect of the exclusions. It is because of this sometimes overlooked, but nevertheless fundamental principle in constitutional free speech doctrine that we must reject appellants' proposed analysis. We turn now to Massachusetts' proposed alternative analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Massachusetts' Need to Regulate the Lawmaking Act</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The communicative power of an initiative stems precisely from the fact that it is not just speech; it is a process that can lead to the creation of new laws or constitutional amendments. Massachusetts urges us to hold that its restrictions on the amendment process do not regulate speech <i>qua</i> speech, and thus do not trigger strict scrutiny under the First Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Government actions that are aimed at some goal other than restricting the conveyance of ideas are generally permissible, even if they incidentally inhibit free speech. <i>See, e.g., Arcara v. Cloud Books, Inc.,</i> 478 U.S. 697, 106 S.Ct. 3172, 92 L.Ed.2d 568 (1986) (upholding the closure of an adult bookstore because prostitution was taking place on the premises). <i>Arcara</i> is a prototypical example of this type of case, because the law in question only regulated a specific type of conduct&#8212;prostitution&#8212;which did not implicate speech. However, even a law seemingly entirely removed from speech can have effects on speech. In <i>Arcara,</i> for example, the prohibition on prostitution resulted in the closure of a book store. Enforcement of a prohibition with such incidental effects does not, however, implicate the First Amendment, and this type of law need only survive rationality review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs do not cite to any precedent for the proposition that, under the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment, a state may not restrict the subjects that can be addressed through its initiative process. The D.C. Circuit addressed a similar free speech challenge to a restriction on an initiative process in the case of <i>Marijuana Policy Project v. United States,</i> 304 F.3d 82 (D.C.Cir.2002). In that case, the D.C. Circuit held that a statute precluding the use of the D.C. ballot initiative process to lower drug penalties did not unconstitutionally restrict free speech rights of medical marijuana advocates, but only shifted the forum of debate from the District of Columbia to Congress. <i>Id.</i> at 85-86. The court explained that \"although the First Amendment protects public debate about legislation, it confers no right to legislate on a particular subject.\" <i>Id.</i> at 85. Massachusetts argues that we should adopt this reasoning to apply rational basis review in the instant case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Regulating Conduct with Speech and Nonspeech Elements</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot agree with the D.C. Circuit's finding that subject-matter exclusions from the initiative process \"restrict[ ] no speech,\" <i>id.</i> at 85, nor with its conclusion that this type of selective carve-out \"implicates no First Amendment concerns,\" <i>id.</i> at 83. For the same reasons, we also reject Massachusetts' argument that we should apply only rational basis review to the Anti-Aid and Religious Exclusions. This case is not like <i>Arcara,</i> where the Supreme Court criticized the New York Court of Appeals for having applied the analysis established in <i>United States v. O'Brien,</i> 391 U.S. 367, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968), because the Court did not consider the regulated conduct&#8212;prostitution&#8212;expressive. <i>See Arcara,</i> 478 U.S. at 705, 106 S.Ct. 3172 (concluding that \"unlike the symbolic draft card burning in <i>O'Brien,</i> the sexual activity carried on in this case manifests absolutely no element of protected expression\"). Rather, we would continue along the analysis laid out by the Supreme Court in <i>Texas v. Johnson,</i> 491 U.S. at 403, 109 S.Ct. 2533. Having determined that <i>Meyer,</i> 486 U.S. at 422, 108 S.Ct. 1886, indicates that a state initiative process manifests elements of protected expression, under <i>Johnson,</i> \"we next decide whether the State's regulation is related to the suppression of free expression.\" 491 U.S. at 403, 109 S.Ct. 2533. Here, as we have already explained, the Massachusetts exclusions in question regulate which types of laws or amendments can be passed by initiative, without any reference to who may speak or what message they may convey. Thus, because \"the State's regulation is not related to expression,... the less stringent standard [the Supreme Court] announced in <i>United States v. O'Brien</i> for regulations of non-communicative conduct controls.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>O'Brien,</i> 391 U.S. at 377, 88 S.Ct. 1673 (finding that, although burning a draft card can be expressive conduct, the federal government's interest in preventing the destruction of draft cards is sufficient to uphold defendant's conviction)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The standard enunciated in <i>O'Brien</i> governs \"when `speech' and `nonspeech' elements are combined in the same course of conduct.\" <i>O'Brien,</i> 391 U.S. at 376, 88 S.Ct. 1673. <i>See also Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence,</i> 468 U.S. 288, 104 S.Ct. 3065, 82 L.Ed.2d 221 (1984) (applying <i>O'Brien</i> scrutiny to the application of a ban on camping on the Mall in Washington, D.C., to demonstrators who sought to sleep overnight there to protest the plight of homeless people). While we agree with the D.C. Circuit that this type of regulation of a state initiative process is not aimed at regulating speech, we cannot see how, given the Supreme Court's analysis in <i>Meyer,</i> subject-matter exclusions from a state initiative process \"restrict[ ] no speech.\" <i>Marijuana Policy Project,</i> 304 F.3d at 85. To the contrary, since expression is affected by the regulations of the state initiative process, we apply the intermediate scrutiny standard set out in <i>O'Brien.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. <i>Applying O'Brien Scrutiny</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the <i>O'Brien</i> standard, conduct combining \"speech\" and \"non-speech\" elements can be regulated if four requirements are met: (1) the regulation \"is within the constitutional power of the Government;\" (2) \"it furthers an important or substantial governmental interest;\" (3) \"the governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression;\" and (4) \"the incidental restriction on alleged First Amendment freedoms is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest.\" <i>O'Brien,</i> 391 U.S. at 377, 88 S.Ct. 1673. We have no difficulty finding that the Massachusetts exclusions meet the second requirement, as Massachusetts certainly has a substantial interest in maintaining the proper balance between promoting free exercise and preventing state establishment of religion. Neither do we doubt that Massachusetts has a substantial interest in restricting the means by which these fundamental rights can be changed. We have already stated that the exclusions aim at preventing certain uses of the initiative process, not at stemming expression, and thus meet the third <i>O'Brien</i> requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the first requirement, that the regulation be within the constitutional power of the government, we find that the only serious, non-speech-related constitutional challenges to Massachusetts' power to regulate the subjects that may be reached by its initiative process are the Free Exercise and Equal Protection arguments, which we reject in this opinion. Having now concluded that Massachusetts' interest in protecting the fundamental free exercise and freedom from state-established religion is substantial and its method otherwise constitutionally permissible, we finally consider the fourth <i>O'Brien</i> requirement: whether the incidental restrictions on would-be initiative proponents' First Amendment freedoms are greater than essential to the furtherance of that interest. Since we see no other way in which Massachusetts could achieve its interest in safeguarding these fundamental freedoms in its Constitution from popular initiative, we recognize that the restriction on speech is no more than is essential. Thus, we conclude that Massachusetts' Anti-Aid and Religious Exclusions do not violate the First Amendment free speech guarantee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Free Exercise Claim</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now consider whether the Religious Exclusion violates the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The Free Exercise Clause guarantees that \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, <i>or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,\"</i> U.S. Const. amend. I (emphasis added), and it has been applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. <i>See Cantwell v. Connecticut,</i> 310 U.S. 296, 303, 60 S.Ct. 900, 84 L.Ed. 1213 (1940).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The protections provided by the Free Exercise Clause may be broken down into a number of conceptual categories, none of which are implicated by the Religious Exclusion. First and foremost, the Free Exercise Clause entails an absolute prohibition on government infringement on the \"freedom to believe.\" <i>Torcaso v. Watkins,</i> 367 U.S. 488, 492-93, 81 S.Ct. 1680, 6 L.Ed.2d 982 (1961). Because the prohibition is absolute, laws which infringe on individuals' freedom of belief are per se unconstitutional. <i>Id.</i> (refusing to consider the state's asserted justifications for a law that infringed on citizens' freedom of belief); <i>see also West Virginia State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette,</i> 319 U.S. 624, 63 S.Ct. 1178, 87 L.Ed. 1628 (1943) (holding that a state could not compel students in public schools to salute the flag, where their religion forbade it). However, that prohibition is inapposite here because the Religious Exclusion does not hinge on the religious beliefs of initiative proponents. <i>See McDaniel v. Paty,</i> 435 U.S. 618, 627, 98 S.Ct. 1322, 55 L.Ed.2d 593 (1978) (finding that a Tennessee law that precluded ministers from eligibility as constitutional convention delegates did not infringe on freedom of belief, but nevertheless invalidating it under strict scrutiny).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>McDaniel v. Paty,</i> the Supreme Court examined a state law preventing a minister from serving as a constitutional convention delegate under strict scrutiny, because although it did not directly burden his religious beliefs, it directly burdened his religious \"status, acts, and conduct.\" <i>McDaniel,</i> 435 U.S. at 626-27, 98 S.Ct. 1322. This protection is related to, though distinct from, the per se prohibition on laws infringing on belief. Arguing from <i>McDaniel,</i> plaintiffs maintain that a state violates the Free Exercise Clause when it creates a general political process, but excludes some from access to that process on the basis of religion. However, plaintiffs fail to explain how this proposition applies to their case. The Religious Exclusion prevents anyone from proposing new laws or constitutional amendments relating to religion through the initiative process. It does not exclude religious people, or people of a certain religion, from proposing laws or amendments. In other words, a religious individual of any particular faith, like any other citizen, can propose a new law or amendment on any subject that is open to amendment by initiative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the Religious Exclusion we are asked to scrutinize does not distinguish based on religious status.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Like the scholarship program at issue in <i>Locke v. Davey,</i> the Religious Exclusion does not deny plaintiffs \"the right to participate in the political affairs of the community,\" 540 U.S. at 720, 124 S.Ct. 1307 (distinguishing <i>Locke</i> from <i>McDaniel,</i> 435 U.S. 618, 98 S.Ct. 1322, 55 L.Ed.2d 593); nor does it \"require[ ] [plaintiffs] to choose between their religious beliefs and receiving a government benefit.\" <i>Id.</i> at 720-21, 98 S.Ct. 1322 (distinguishing <i>Hobbie v. Unemployment Appeals Comm'n of Fla.,</i> 480 U.S. 136, 107 S.Ct. 1046, 94 L.Ed.2d 190 (1987); <i>Thomas v. Review Bd. of Ind. Employment Security Div.,</i> 450 U.S. 707, 101 S.Ct. 1425, 67 L.Ed.2d 624 (1981); <i>Sherbert v. Verner,</i> 374 U.S. 398, 83 S.Ct. 1790, 10 L.Ed.2d 965 (1963)). The exclusion applies equally to measures proposed by any group or individual, regardless of their religious affiliation or lack thereof.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having concluded that the Religious Exclusion does not discriminate on the basis of religious belief or status, we also briefly note that plaintiffs make no colorable argument that the exclusion prohibits any religious act or conduct. It does not, for example, preclude performing rites required by their religion, <i>see Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah,</i> 508 U.S. 520, 533, 113 S.Ct. 2217, 124 L.Ed.2d 472 (1993) (outlawing animal sacrifice central to the Santer&#237;a religion), or single out their religion's method of worship, <i>see Fowler v. Rhode Island,</i> 345 U.S. 67, 73 S.Ct. 526, 97 L.Ed. 828 (1953) (preventing Jehovah's Witnesses from meeting in public parks while other denominations were allowed to hold services). The Supreme Court has stated its reluctance to strike down \"legislation which imposes only an indirect burden on the exercise of religion, <i>i.e.,</i> legislation which does not make unlawful the religious practice itself.\" <i>Braunfeld v. Brown,</i> 366 U.S. 599, 606, 81 S.Ct. 1144, 6 L.Ed.2d 563 (1961). Certainly, the amendments that plaintiffs want to propose may be motivated by their religious beliefs, but they do not claim that working to pass those amendments is an aspect of practicing their religion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, plaintiffs ask us to consider whether the passage of the Religious Exclusion was motivated by animus toward religion. The Supreme Court has considered the existence of animus motivating a law's proponents when determining whether the law violates the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. <i>See, e.g., Locke,</i> 540 U.S. at 725, 124 S.Ct. 1307 (finding nothing in the history, text or application of the Washington scholarship program in question \"that suggests animus towards religion\"). In the Establishment Clause context, the Supreme Court has \"often stated the principle that the First Amendment forbids an official purpose to disapprove of a particular religion or of religion in general.\" <i>Church of the Lukumi,</i> 508 U.S. at 532, 113 S.Ct. 2217 (noting that \"[t]hese cases, however, for the most part have addressed governmental efforts to benefit religion or particular religions, and so have dealt with a question different, at least in its formulation and emphasis, from the issue here\"). Although plaintiffs present significant evidence of animus against Catholics in Massachusetts in 1855 when the Anti-Aid Amendment was passed, they fail to show that religious animus motivated the passage of the Religious Exclusion in 1918. Plaintiffs rely heavily on one statement made by the Religious Exclusion's sponsor, indicating that he would \"protect the initiative and referendum against the religious fanatics and against the professional religionists.\" However, we need not reach the question of whether this type of fervor against religiously motivated political action would require that the amendment be struck down, because plaintiffs present no evidence that the other members of the Constitutional Convention of 1917-1918 acted from similar motivations. Given the wide margin by which the Religious Exclusion passed, and the significant Catholic representation at the Convention, we see no evidence that animus against religion was a motivating factor behind the Exclusion's passage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, plaintiffs cite to no case in which evidence of animus toward religion was itself sufficient to invalidate a government action, without the animus being tied to some resulting infringement on freedom of belief or on religious status, acts or conduct. While we must apply strict scrutiny when \"the object of a law is to infringe upon or restrict <i>practices</i> because of their religious motivation,\" plaintiffs here have not shown that the Religious Exclusion results in any restriction of their religious practices. <i>Id.</i> at 533, 113 S.Ct. 2217 (citing <i>Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith,</i> 494 U.S. 872, 878-79, 110 S.Ct. 1595, 108 L.Ed.2d 876 (1990)) (emphasis added) (considering evidence of animus toward the Santer&#237;a religion where the ordinance prohibiting ritual slaughter of animals did not, on its face, target the Santer&#237;a religion, but effectively outlawed one of the religion's \"principal forms of devotion\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Equal Protection</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs also argue that the Massachusetts Exclusions violate the protections afforded by the Equal Protection Clause. U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Plaintiffs argue that the Religious Exclusion violates equal protection guarantees because it infringes on the fundamental right to religious free exercise, disadvantages a suspect class, and fails the more searching rational basis review required in <i>Romer v. Evans,</i> 517 U.S. 620, 116 S.Ct. 1620, 134 L.Ed.2d 855 (1996). They also challenge the Anti-Aid Exclusion under a suspect classification theory and a disparate impact theory. Because of the complexity of the various equal protection arguments presented, we will address the arguments one at a time, to the extent that is possible. In the end, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment against plaintiffs' equal protection claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Alleged Violation of the Equal Protection Fundamental Right to Free Exercise of Religion</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before moving to what we see as the substance of plaintiffs' equal protection claims, we first address their argument that the Massachusetts Exclusions restricts their fundamental right to free exercise of religion. Where a plaintiff's First Amendment Free Exercise claim has failed, the Supreme Court has applied only rational basis scrutiny in its subsequent review of an equal protection fundamental right to religious free exercise claim based on the same facts. <i>Locke,</i> 540 U.S. at 721, n. 3, 124 S.Ct. 1307 (citing <i>Johnson v. Robison,</i> 415 U.S. 361, 375, n. 14, 94 S.Ct. 1160, 39 L.Ed.2d 389, (1974)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Because we held, above, that the Religious Exclusion does not violate the Free Exercise Clause, we apply rational basis scrutiny to the fundamental rights based claim that this exclusion violates equal protection. For the reasons stated throughout this opinion, we find that the Massachusetts Exclusions pass such review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Plaintiffs' Claim that the Religious and Anti-Aid Exclusions Implicate a Suspect Classification</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The central equal protection issue presented is whether the Massachusetts Religious Exclusion and Anti-Aid Exclusion impermissibly distort the political process to the disadvantage of religious individuals. Because we find that the Religious Exclusion does not draw distinctions based on a suspect classification, we hold that it does not violate the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs claim that the Religious Exclusion and Anti-Aid Exclusion draw distinctions on the basis of religion, which they argue is a suspect classification for purposes of equal protection analysis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> However, even assuming that religious classification should be treated as suspect, we do not see how the Religious Exclusion and Anti-Aid Exclusion draw distinctions among Massachusetts citizens based on a suspect classification. The Religious Exclusion prohibits initiative petitions that concern \"religion, religious practices or religious institutions.\" The Anti-Aid Exclusion precludes amendment by initiative of the Anti-Aid Amendment, which, in addition to containing Massachusetts' free exercise clause, prevents state funding for private institutions. On their face, the Exclusions simply carve out particular subject matters from the initiative process. They do not require different treatment of any class of people because of their religious beliefs. They do not give preferential treatment to any particular religion. <i>See Larson v. Valente,</i> 456 U.S. 228, 246, 102 S.Ct. 1673, 72 L.Ed.2d 33 (1982) (holding, on First Amendment grounds, that \"a state law granting a denominational preference\" must be treated as suspect, and subjected to strict scrutiny). In short, this is not the classic violation of equal protection in which a law creates different rules for distinct groups of individuals based on a suspect classification. <i>See, e.g., Strauder v. West Virginia,</i> 100 U.S. 303, 25 L.Ed. 664 (1879) (overturning state law which limited jury service to white men only).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has, nevertheless, sometimes struck down facially neutral laws, which it recognized were crafted to avoid facial discrimination. <i>See, e.g., Hunter v. Erickson,</i> 393 U.S. 385, 387-91, 89 S.Ct. 557, 21 L.Ed.2d 616 (1969) (invalidating an amendment to the Akron, Ohio city charter, which, in addition to the usual vote by the city council, required approval by a majority of the city's voters for any ordinance regulating real estate transactions \"on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin or ancestry,\" even though the law \"on its face treats [African-American] and white, Jew and gentile in an identical manner\"); <i>Washington v. Seattle</i> <i>School Dist. No. 1,</i> 458 U.S. 457, 102 S.Ct. 3187, 73 L.Ed.2d 896 (1982) (striking down a Washington initiative that prohibited school boards from requiring children to be bused to more distant public schools, while at the same time making exceptions for every imaginable impetus for busing other than racial integration). Unlike the Massachusetts Exclusions, the law in <i>Hunter</i> evinces a clear, solely detrimental effect on a suspect class. In <i>Hunter,</i> the law's one obvious result was to make it more difficult to pass laws prohibiting racial discrimination. <i>Hunter,</i> 393 U.S. at 391, 89 S.Ct. 557. Similarly, in <i>Washington,</i> although the initiative did not say so on its face, children could be bused to a more distant school for virtually any reason except racial integration. 458 U.S. at 471, 102 S.Ct. 3187. In contrast, the Massachusetts Religious Exclusion prevents both initiatives that would disfavor as well as those that might benefit religion, and the Anti-Aid Exclusion, in addition to preventing amendment of the clause precluding funding to private institutions, also prohibits amendment of Massachusetts' free exercise clause. Unlike the laws invalidated in <i>Hunter</i> and <i>Washington,</i> it is undeniable that the Massachusetts Exclusions both hinder and help the causes of the alleged suspect class.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certainly any form of invidious discrimination because of religion is forbidden. But \"the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause[ ] are frequently in tension.\" <i>Locke,</i> 540 U.S. at 718, 124 S.Ct. 1307. States may properly refuse to enact laws that they reasonably believe may tend to establish religion. While the free exercise of religion is guaranteed, state support of religion is, in general, disfavored. And we know of no constitutional principle that prevents a state from determining that sensitive measures that relate to religion, religious practices, or religious institutions should not be made or initiated by the public initiative process but rather only via the legislature. A state might fear that such measures, if presented as public referenda, might be more likely to fuel religious strife or to result in enactments unfair to religious (or non-religious) minorities. Bearing these distinctions in mind, we are disinclined to extend the race-based <i>Hunter</i> and <i>Washington</i> lines of cases to this context, which so closely mirrors the mandates found in our federal Establishment Clause and Free Exercise Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Plaintiffs Have Not Shown Discriminatory Intent</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs further argue that the Anti-Aid Exclusion violates the Equal Protection Clause on a disparate impact theory. However, this argument fails because plaintiffs have not shown a discriminatory purpose behind the exclusion. \"[A] law, neutral on its face and serving ends otherwise within the power of government to pursue,\" is not invalid under the Equal Protection Clause simply because it may disproportionately affect a suspect class. <i>Washington v. Davis,</i> 426 U.S. 229, 242, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 48 L.Ed.2d 597 (1976). \"An unwavering line of cases from [the Supreme Court] holds that a violation of the Equal Protection Clause requires state action motivated by discriminatory intent; the disproportionate effects of state action are not sufficient to establish such a violation.\" <i>Hernandez v. New York,</i> 500 U.S. 352, 372-73, 111 S.Ct. 1859, 114 L.Ed.2d 395 (1991). Plaintiffs present evidence that widespread anti-Catholic prejudice was a motivating factor behind passage of the original Anti-Aid Amendment in 1855, a fact which defendants do not dispute. However, the Anti-Aid Amendment was largely overhauled in 1917, with the support of 85 of the 94 Catholic delegates to the Constitutional Convention, and soon afterwards, the Anti-Aid Exclusion was passed with similarly broad support. No evidence has been offered that the exclusion was motivated by the same Anti-Catholic animus that impelled the passage of the original Anti-Aid Amendment. Plaintiffs cannot mix and match the intent behind one amendment and place it with the impact of a later, distinct amendment. Thus, without reaching the question of whether the Anti-Aid Exclusion has a disparate effect on religious individuals, we reject plaintiffs' equal protection disparate impact argument because plaintiffs fail to show the required discriminatory intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. <i>Rational Basis Review Under Romer v.

Evans,</i> 517 U.S. 620, 631, 116 S.Ct. 1620, 134 L.Ed.2d 855 (1996) (striking down an amendment to the Colorado Constitution that would have precluded protection from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation as failing rational basis review). In this case, we have no difficulty finding that Massachusetts' goal of preventing the establishment of religion is a legitimate one. Additionally, the chosen means clearly bear a rational relation to that end. Thus, the instant case is easily distinguished from <i>Romer,</i> where the Court found that passage of the Colorado amendment could only be explained by \"`a bare ... desire to harm a politically unpopular group,'\" which \"`cannot constitute a legitimate governmental interest.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 634, 116 S.Ct. 1620 (quoting <i>Dep't of Agric. v.

It bears clarifying that we do not read this statement to be a blanket rule that where a Free Exercise Claim fails, all equal protection claims based on the same facts must also fail. Looking back to <i>Johnson v.

They now challenge these subject-matter exclusions from the initiative process on federal Free Speech, Free Exercise, and Equal Protection grounds.

Const. amend. art. 18. Article 48 of the Massachusetts Constitution provides that, in addition to the amendment procedure available to the state legislature, the Constitution may also be amended by popular initiative. Mass. Const. amend. art. 48, pt. 1. Following the required procedure, plaintiffs submitted an initiative petition, for certification, to the Massachusetts Attorney General to modify the Anti-Aid Amendment by adding a sentence stating that nothing in the Anti-Aid Amendment shall prevent the Commonwealth from providing loans, grants, or tax benefits to students attending private schools, regardless of the schools' religious affiliation. The Attorney General, however, denied certification of the proposed initiative, because Article 48 prohibits amendment of the Anti-Aid Amendment by initiative (the \"Anti-Aid Exclusion\") and because the petition explicitly relates to \"religious institutions,\" another matter expressly excluded from the initiative process by Article 48 (the \"Religious Exclusion\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section Two of Article 48 limits Massachusetts' initiative process by listing the \"Excluded Matters,\" which are not subject to popular action by initiative, including, <i>inter alia,</i> appointment or compensation of judges; the powers, creation or abolition of the courts; and specific appropriation of state money. Mass. Const. amend. art. 48, pt. 2, &#167; 2. The pertinent provision of Article 48, referred to as the Anti-Aid Exclusion, states that \"[n]either the eighteenth [Anti-Aid] amendment of the constitution... nor this provision for its protection, shall be the subject of an initiative amendment,\" while the Religious Exclusion mandates that \"[n]o measure that relates to religion, religious practices or religious institutions... shall be proposed by an initiative petition.\" <i>Id.</i> Plaintiffs challenge the validity of both of these exclusions under the U.S. Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Analysis</i></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Free Speech Claim</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first issue before us is whether the Massachusetts Constitution's limitations on the initiative process violate the First Amendment free speech rights of prospective initiative proponents.

In <i>P&#233;rez-Guzm&#225;n,</i> 346 F.3d at 239-47, we invalidated Puerto Rico's requirement that petition signatures needed for registering a new political party to appear on the general election ballot be notarized, holding that it violated the First Amendment of the federal Constitution. In so doing, we stated that \"we afford exacting scrutiny to severe restrictions on ballot access.\" <i>Id.</i> at 239. We began our analysis \"with an assessment of the severity of the restriction,\" <i>id.,</i> and having found it to be severe, we applied strict scrutiny, <i>id.</i> at 243-44.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs argue that we should apply a similar two-step analysis here. However, plaintiffs' suggested analysis makes an end-run around the most difficult part of their case. The district court in this case found that speech was only incidentally affected by the Massachusetts subject matter exclusions. <i>Boyette v. Galvin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2314499\"><a href=\"/opinion/2314499/boyette-v-galvin/\"><span class=\"volume\">311</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">237</span></a></span>, 240 (D.Mass.2004). Although the district court recognized that speech was involved, it concluded that the primary goal of the exclusion was to prevent certain types of laws from being passed by means of the popular initiative process, and not to limit <i>what</i> people could say or <i>how</i> they could say it. <i>Id.</i> at 240-41. By contrast, the common denominator in <i>P&#233;rez-Guzm&#225;n</i> and other cases cited by plaintiffs is a direct restriction on the communicative aspect of the political process. In <i>P&#233;rez-Guzm&#225;n,</i> like in <i>Meyer,</i> the state regulated <i>how</i> people could promulgate their political views, in their respective attempts to put a new party on the ballot, <i>P&#233;rez-Guzm&#225;n,</i> 346 F.3d at 230-31, and to circulate petitions for a proposed initiative, <i>Meyer,</i> 486 U.S. at 414, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112087\"><a href=\"/opinion/112087/meyer-v-grant/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Strict scrutiny applied in these cases precisely because they involved direct regulation of the petition <i>process</i> itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe that the present case calls for a lower level of scrutiny. We know of no general principle that, in addition to constitutional amendment or lawmaking via a process instituted by the state legislature, a state must provide an opportunity for its residents to propose constitutional amendments or laws on all subjects by means of an initiative process. While we accept that use of the initiative process can facilitate dissemination of initiative proponents' views, the next step in a free speech analysis is to determine whether or not the regulation in question aims at regulating speech, or whether it has some other primary end, such that any effect on speech is purely incidental. As we alluded to at the outset of this analysis, the First Amendment generally provides greater protection against laws that are \"aimed at communicative impact\" of the conduct they regulate than from laws \"aimed at non-communicative impact, but nonetheless having adverse effects on communicative opportunity.\" Tribe, <i>American Constitutional Law</i> &#167; 12-2, at 790. The primary goal of state initiative procedures is to create an avenue of direct democracy whereby citizens can participate in the generation of legislation&#8212;that is, the <i>act</i> of creating law. Laws such as those considered in <i>Meyer</i> and its progeny were aimed at directly regulating the <i>means</i> that initiative proponents could use to reach their audience of potential petition signers. In contrast, we find that subject matter exclusions like those regulating the Massachusetts initiative process aim at preventing the <i>act</i> of generating laws and constitutional amendments about certain subjects by initiative. While they eliminate a valuable avenue of expression about those subjects, the speech restriction is no more than an unintended side-effect of the exclusions. It is because of this sometimes overlooked, but nevertheless fundamental principle in constitutional free speech doctrine that we must reject appellants' proposed analysis. We turn now to Massachusetts' proposed alternative analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Massachusetts' Need to Regulate the Lawmaking Act</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The communicative power of an initiative stems precisely from the fact that it is not just speech; it is a process that can lead to the creation of new laws or constitutional amendments. Massachusetts urges us to hold that its restrictions on the amendment process do not regulate speech <i>qua</i> speech, and thus do not trigger strict scrutiny under the First Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Government actions that are aimed at some goal other than restricting the conveyance of ideas are generally permissible, even if they incidentally inhibit free speech. <i>See, e.g., Arcara v.

However, even a law seemingly entirely removed from speech can have effects on speech. In <i>Arcara,</i> for example, the prohibition on prostitution resulted in the closure of a book store. Enforcement of a prohibition with such incidental effects does not, however, implicate the First Amendment, and this type of law need only survive rationality review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs do not cite to any precedent for the proposition that, under the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment, a state may not restrict the subjects that can be addressed through its initiative process. The D.C. Circuit addressed a similar free speech challenge to a restriction on an initiative process in the case of <i>Marijuana Policy Project v.

In that case, the D.C. Circuit held that a statute precluding the use of the D.C. ballot initiative process to lower drug penalties did not unconstitutionally restrict free speech rights of medical marijuana advocates, but only shifted the forum of debate from the District of Columbia to Congress. <i>Id.</i> at 85-86. The court explained that \"although the First Amendment protects public debate about legislation, it confers no right to legislate on a particular subject.\" <i>Id.</i> at 85.

We have no difficulty finding that the Massachusetts exclusions meet the second requirement, as Massachusetts certainly has a substantial interest in maintaining the proper balance between promoting free exercise and preventing state establishment of religion.

Having now concluded that Massachusetts' interest in protecting the fundamental free exercise and freedom from state-established religion is substantial and its method otherwise constitutionally permissible, we finally consider the fourth <i>O'Brien</i> requirement: whether the incidental restrictions on would-be initiative proponents' First Amendment freedoms are greater than essential to the furtherance of that interest. Since we see no other way in which Massachusetts could achieve its interest in safeguarding these fundamental freedoms in its Constitution from popular initiative, we recognize that the restriction on speech is no more than is essential.

Plaintiffs rely heavily on one statement made by the Religious Exclusion's sponsor, indicating that he would \"protect the initiative and referendum against the religious fanatics and against the professional religionists.\" However, we need not reach the question of whether this type of fervor against religiously motivated political action would require that the amendment be struck down, because plaintiffs present no evidence that the other members of the Constitutional Convention of 1917-1918 acted from similar motivations.

The Religious Exclusion prohibits initiative petitions that concern \"religion, religious practices or religious institutions.\" The Anti-Aid Exclusion precludes amendment by initiative of the Anti-Aid Amendment, which, in addition to containing Massachusetts' free exercise clause, prevents state funding for private institutions. On their face, the Exclusions simply carve out particular subject matters from the initiative process. They do not require different treatment of any class of people because of their religious beliefs. They do not give preferential treatment to any particular religion. <i>See Larson v.

In short, this is not the classic violation of equal protection in which a law creates different rules for distinct groups of individuals based on a suspect classification. <i>See, e.g., Strauder v.

Unlike the Massachusetts Exclusions, the law in <i>Hunter</i> evinces a clear, solely detrimental effect on a suspect class. In <i>Hunter,</i> the law's one obvious result was to make it more difficult to pass laws prohibiting racial discrimination. <i>Hunter,</i> 393 U.S. at 391, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107825\"><a href=\"/opinion/107825/hunter-v-erickson/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In contrast, the Massachusetts Religious Exclusion prevents both initiatives that would disfavor as well as those that might benefit religion, and the Anti-Aid Exclusion, in addition to preventing amendment of the clause precluding funding to private institutions, also prohibits amendment of Massachusetts' free exercise clause. Unlike the laws invalidated in <i>Hunter</i> and <i>Washington,</i> it is undeniable that the Massachusetts Exclusions both hinder and help the causes of the alleged suspect class.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certainly any form of invidious discrimination because of religion is forbidden.

While the free exercise of religion is guaranteed, state support of religion is, in general, disfavored. And we know of no constitutional principle that prevents a state from determining that sensitive measures that relate to religion, religious practices, or religious institutions should not be made or initiated by the public initiative process but rather only via the legislature. A state might fear that such measures, if presented as public referenda, might be more likely to fuel religious strife or to result in enactments unfair to religious (or non-religious) minorities. Bearing these distinctions in mind, we are disinclined to extend the race-based <i>Hunter</i> and <i>Washington</i> lines of cases to this context, which so closely mirrors the mandates found in our federal Establishment Clause and Free Exercise Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Plaintiffs Have Not Shown Discriminatory Intent</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs further argue that the Anti-Aid Exclusion violates the Equal Protection Clause on a disparate impact theory. However, this argument fails because plaintiffs have not shown a discriminatory purpose behind the exclusion. \"[A] law, neutral on its face and serving ends otherwise within the power of government to pursue,\" is not invalid under the Equal Protection Clause simply because it may disproportionately affect a suspect class. <i>Washington v.

Plaintiffs present evidence that widespread anti-Catholic prejudice was a motivating factor behind passage of the original Anti-Aid Amendment in 1855, a fact which defendants do not dispute. However, the Anti-Aid Amendment was largely overhauled in 1917, with the support of 85 of the 94 Catholic delegates to the Constitutional Convention, and soon afterwards, the Anti-Aid Exclusion was passed with similarly broad support. No evidence has been offered that the exclusion was motivated by the same Anti-Catholic animus that impelled the passage of the original Anti-Aid Amendment. Plaintiffs cannot mix and match the intent behind one amendment and place it with the impact of a later, distinct amendment. Thus, without reaching the question of whether the Anti-Aid Exclusion has a disparate effect on religious individuals, we reject plaintiffs' equal protection disparate impact argument because plaintiffs fail to show the required discriminatory intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. <i>Rational Basis Review Under Romer v.
