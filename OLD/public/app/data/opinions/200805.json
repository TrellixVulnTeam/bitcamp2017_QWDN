William E. Smith, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n                      Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n                 and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Thomas E. Clinton with whom Clinton & Muzyka, P.C. was on\nbrief for petitioner, appellant RJF International Corporation.\n     Howard B. Klein with whom John S. Foley and Decof & Decof were\non brief for claimant, appellee Kimberly Moody Hanna, as legal\nguardian of James Avery.\n\n\n\n                         January 8, 2004\n\f           BOUDIN, Chief Judge.    On August 11, 2001, James Avery,\n\nthen 18 years old, was employed on the M/V Reflections, a yacht\n\ndocked in Newport, Rhode Island.        In the course of his duties, he\n\nfell from the yacht, struck his head on the dock, and fell into the\n\nwater.   Before his rescue, he spent 7 to 10 minutes under water.\n\nThe result was anoxic brain injury--anoxic refers to the lack of\n\noxygen--so severe that his life was despaired of.\n\n           By the time of his discharge from the last of several\n\nhospitals (in March 2002), Avery could not speak intelligibly but\n\ncould follow commands, respond to questions by closing his eyes,\n\nmake sounds, and was starting to use his head and chin to activate\n\nassistive equipment. His doctors then formulated plans for further\n\nrehabilitation, opining that more cognitive and functional progress\n\nwas   possible.   They   contemplated     that   Avery   would   be   given\n\ninpatient treatment at a specialized institute in Chicago and then\n\nreceive further outpatient day treatment at a Florida facility.\n\n           During this time, the vessel owner had paid heavily for\n\nAvery's medical expenses as part of its obligation to provide\n\nmaintenance and cure for an injured seaman.       See Calmar S.S. Corp.\n\nv. Taylor, 303 U.S. 525, 527-29 (1938).       Obtaining its own medical\n\nevaluation, the vessel owner concluded that Avery now suffered from\n\npermanent conditions that were beyond its responsibility under the\n\nmaintenance and cure doctrine.    When the owner refused to fund the\n\nnew treatment plan, Avery's guardian filed a motion to compel\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fpayment, and the owner cross moved to terminate maintenance and\n\ncure benefits.        Both motions were filed in the context of an\n\nadmiralty proceeding that had been initiated by the owner on\n\nDecember 12, 2001, to limit its liability with regard to this\n\nincident.        46 U.S.C. app. §§ 181-196 (2000); Rule            F of the\n\nSupplemental Rules for Certain Admiralty and Maritime Claims of the\n\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n             The district court held an evidentiary hearing in April\n\n2003, receiving on Avery's behalf deposition testimony from Avery's\n\ntreating physicians and his mother, and Avery's medical records;\n\nthe owner offered testimony from a neuro-psychologist and a letter\n\nfrom a neurologist.       On May 7, 2003, the district court issued a\n\ndecision granting Avery's motion to order further care and denying\n\nthe owner's motion.       In re RJF Int'l Corp., 261 F. Supp. 2d 101,\n\n106-07 (D.R.I. 2003).        The court found that Avery had not yet\n\nreached a point of \"maximum medical recovery\" and that therefore\n\nthe obligation to provide maintenance and cure continued.             Id. at\n\n105-06.\n\n            On    this   appeal,   the    owner    makes   three   different\n\narguments.       The first is that the district court misread the law\n\nbecause it ordered maintenance and cure for one who now suffers\n\nfrom brain damage and associated symptoms (e.g., spastic muscle\n\nreactions) that are clearly permanent.            This, says the owner, is\n\ncontrary to Farrell v. United States, 336 U.S. 511 (1949), Vella v.\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fFord Motor Co., 421 U.S. 1 (1975), and other cases limiting\n\nmaintenance and cure to the period in which the injured seaman is\n\nmoving toward recovery.1\n\n          When his condition has stabilized and further progress\n\nended short of a full recovery, the seaman may still have a remedy\n\nto compensate him for his permanent injury,2 but is no longer\n\nentitled to maintenance and cure.    Thus, in Farrell the Court said\n\nthat maintenance and cure did not extend to ongoing medical care to\n\nease the pain of headaches and to control convulsions deemed\n\npermanent conditions.   336 U.S. at 512-13, 519.   In Vella, relief\n\nfrom permanently recurring dizzy spells was denied, although the\n\nshipowner was required to pay maintenance and cure up to the point\n\nwhere the condition was medically diagnosed as permanent. 421 U.S.\n\nat 2-6.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      See generally Pelotto v. L & N Towing Co., 604 F.2d 396, 400\n(5th Cir. 1979) (\"Thus, where it appears that the seaman's\ncondition is incurable, or that future treatment will merely\nrelieve pain and suffering but not otherwise improve the seaman's\nphysical condition, it is proper to declare that the point of\nmaximum cure has been achieved.\"); Cox v. Dravo Corp., 517 F.2d\n620, 623, 627 (3d Cir. 1975) (maintenance and cure payments not\nrequired if additional treatment is only to \"arrest further\nprogress of the disease or to relieve pain\").\n     2\n      The traditional remedy for damages is based on the\nunseaworthiness of the vessel under general maritime law; but a\nstatutory remedy for negligence under the Jones Act is also\ncommonly employed, 46 U.S.C. app. § 688 (2000); see Ferrara v. A.\n& V. Fishing, Inc., 99 F.3d 449, 453-54 (1996), and Avery has\nclaims under both theories pending before the district court. In\nre RJF, 261 F. Supp. 2d at 102 n.2.\n\n                               -4-\n\f          In this case, the difficulty for the owner is that the\n\ndistrict court recognized the fuzzy boundary between improvement\n\nand palliation, but it found that the evidence showed that Avery\n\nwas still capable of improvement through continued treatment.              In\n\nre RJF, 261 F. Supp. 2d at 105-06.              The testimony of Avery's\n\ndoctors is straightforward that further long-term improvement is\n\nstill possible, and even the competing diagnoses by the owner's\n\nexperts leave some room for such a conclusion.                Certainly the\n\ndistrict court did not commit clear error on this issue of fact.\n\nSee Capone v. Boat St. Victoria, 1989 A.M.C. 1782, 1797 (D. Mass.\n\n1989).\n\n          At some points in his main brief and oral argument,\n\ncounsel for the owner appears to suggest that the case law cuts off\n\nmaintenance     and   cure   whenever   a   permanent   condition    exists,\n\nregardless of whether its severity can be reduced.                  But this\n\nreading would contradict repeated references in the case law to\n\nmaximum medical recovery as the dividing line.              E.g., Vaughan v.\n\nAtkinson, 369 U.S. 527, 531 (1962).         In Farrell and Vella, there is\n\nno indication that further improvement in the underlying condition\n\nwas the purpose of the care there sought.            Farrell, 336 U.S. at\n\n512-13; Vella, 421 U.S. at 2-3.\n\n          The owner's second argument on this appeal is that the\n\ndistrict court erred because the rehabilitation envisaged for Avery\n\nis   directed    in   part   to   coping    with   muscle    spasticity   and\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fcontractions.       The owner says, with some support, that these are\n\nmere symptoms of the permanent brain injury.                        He then argues,\n\nblending this new argument into the old, that this shows that\n\ncurative treatment is no longer available and that any further\n\nexpenditure for Avery's rehabilitation is not properly one for\n\nmaintenance and cure.\n\n            But Avery's doctors clearly opined that he could make\n\nfurther cognitive improvement as a result of treatment--not just by\n\nthe passage of time--and their testimony may also suggest that even\n\nhis   muscle     ailments    can      be   permanently      lessened.       Certainly\n\nevidence as to the former supports the district court's finding\n\nthat \"further rehabilitation would be more than simply palliative,\n\nand would improve his medical condition.\"                In re RJF, 261 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 105.       This is enough to support an award of maintenance and\n\ncure in aid of permanent improvement short of a complete cure.\n\n            Of course, the owner might have tried to distinguish\n\nbetween    curative       treatment        still   possible     and     accompanying\n\npalliative measures, and then argued that the cost of palliation\n\noffered in       the    course   of    treatment     should    be    segregated   and\n\nexcluded from the owner's obligation.                Some segregation would be\n\nsilly--imagine excluding pain medicine from the setting of a broken\n\nbone--but perhaps in some settings a distinction might be drawn.\n\nSuch a distinction could matter because maintenance and cure is\n\nexempt    from    the    limitation        of   liability   rules     in   admiralty.\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fBrister v. A.W.I., Inc., 946 F.2d 350, 360-61 (5th Cir. 1991); see\n\nalso Gilmore & Black, The Law of Admiralty, at 901-02 (2d ed.\n\n1975).\n\n          However, in this court the owner has adopted an all or\n\nnothing approach (although it appears that it did attempt to make\n\na segregation argument in the district court).   It is not our task\n\nto devise alternative arguments that have not been pressed on\n\nappeal.   Indeed, such a segregation argument in this case would\n\ninvolve both legal and factual issues of some complexity which\n\nneither side has briefed.\n\n          Similarly, the owner's claim that the maintenance and\n\ncure award should be curtailed because Avery was allegedly eligible\n\nfor Medicare was not presented in timely fashion in the district\n\ncourt; before the hearing, the owner argued only that medical\n\ninsurance would cover palliative care, adding tersely that Avery\n\nwas \"also entitled to Medicare or Medicaid.\" The present claim was\n\nraised only in a closing brief intended to sum up after the hearing\n\nand not to raise new issues.    Thus this argument too must await\n\nanother day.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -7-\n\f",

In the course of his duties, he fell from the yacht, struck his head on the dock, and fell into the water. Before his rescue, he spent 7 to 10 minutes under water. The result was anoxic brain injury &#8212; anoxic refers to the lack of oxygen &#8212; so severe that his life was despaired of.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the time of his discharge from the last of several hospitals (in March 2002), Avery could not speak intelligibly but could follow commands, respond to questions by closing his eyes, make sounds, and was starting to use his head and chin to activate assistive equipment. His doctors then formulated plans for further rehabilitation, opining that more cognitive and functional progress was possible. They contemplated that Avery would be given inpatient treatment at a specialized institute in Chicago and then receive further outpatient day treatment at a Florida facility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During this time, the vessel owner had paid heavily for Avery's medical expenses as part of its obligation to provide maintenance and cure for an injured seaman. <i>See Calmar S.S. Corp. v. Taylor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102997\"><a href=\"/opinion/102997/calmar-ss-corp-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">525</span></a></span>, 527-29, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">651</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">993</span></span> (1938). Obtaining its own medical evaluation, the vessel owner concluded that Avery now suffered from permanent conditions that were beyond its responsibility under the maintenance and cure doctrine. When the owner refused to fund the new treatment plan, Avery's guardian filed a motion to compel payment, and the owner cross moved to terminate maintenance and cure benefits. Both motions were filed in the context of an admiralty proceeding that had been initiated by the owner on December 12, 2001, to limit its liability with regard to this incident. 46 U.S.C. app. &#167;&#167; 181-196 (2000); Rule F of the Supplemental Rules for Certain Admiralty and Maritime Claims of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held an evidentiary hearing in April 2003, receiving on Avery's behalf deposition testimony from Avery's treating physicians and his mother, and Avery's medical records; the owner offered testimony from a neuro-psychologist and a letter from a neurologist. On May 7, 2003, the district court issued a decision granting Avery's motion to order further care and denying the owner's motion. <i>In re RJF Int'l Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2515646\"><a href=\"/opinion/2515646/in-re-petition-of-rjf-intern-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">261</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">101</span></a></span>, 106-07 (D.R.I.2003). The court found that Avery had not yet reached a point of \"maximum medical recovery\" and that therefore the obligation to provide maintenance and cure continued. <i>Id.</i> at 105-06.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal, the owner makes three different arguments. The first is that the district court misread the law because it ordered maintenance and cure for one who now suffers from brain damage and associated symptoms (<i>e.g.,</i> spastic muscle reactions) that are clearly permanent. This, says the owner, is contrary to <i>Farrell v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104651\"><a href=\"/opinion/104651/farrell-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">336</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104651\"><a href=\"/opinion/104651/farrell-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">850</span></a></span> (1949), <i>Vella v. Ford Motor Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109234\"><a href=\"/opinion/109234/vella-v-ford-motor-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109234\"><a href=\"/opinion/109234/vella-v-ford-motor-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1381</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109234\"><a href=\"/opinion/109234/vella-v-ford-motor-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">682</span></a></span> (1975), and other cases limiting maintenance and cure to the period in which the injured seaman is moving toward recovery.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When his condition has stabilized and further progress ended short of a full recovery, the seaman may still have a remedy to compensate him for his permanent injury,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> but is no longer entitled to maintenance and cure. Thus, in <i>Farrell</i> the Court said that maintenance and cure did not extend to ongoing medical care to ease the pain of headaches and to control convulsions deemed permanent conditions. 336 U.S. at 512-13, 519, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104651\"><a href=\"/opinion/104651/farrell-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">707</span></a></span>. In <i>Vella,</i> relief from permanently recurring dizzy spells was denied, although the shipowner was required to pay maintenance and cure up to the point where the condition was medically diagnosed as permanent. 421 U.S. at 2-6, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109234\"><a href=\"/opinion/109234/vella-v-ford-motor-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1381</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the difficulty for the owner is that the district court recognized the fuzzy boundary between improvement and palliation, but it found that the evidence showed that Avery was still capable of improvement through continued treatment. <i>In re RJF,</i> 261 F.Supp.2d at 105-06. The testimony of Avery's doctors is straightforward that further long-term improvement is still possible, and even the competing diagnoses by the owner's experts leave some room for such a conclusion. Certainly the district court did not commit clear error on this issue of fact. <i>See Capone v. Boat St. Victoria,</i> 1989 A.M.C. 1782, 1797 (D.Mass.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At some points in his main brief and oral argument, counsel for the owner appears to suggest that the case law cuts off maintenance and cure whenever a permanent condition exists, regardless of whether its severity can be reduced. But this reading would contradict repeated references in the case law to maximum medical recovery as the dividing line. <i>E.g., Vaughan v. Atkinson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106390\"><a href=\"/opinion/106390/vaughan-v-atkinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">369</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">527</span></a></span>, 531, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106390\"><a href=\"/opinion/106390/vaughan-v-atkinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">997</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106390\"><a href=\"/opinion/106390/vaughan-v-atkinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">88</span></a></span> (1962). In <i>Farrell</i> and <i>Vella,</i> there is no indication that further improvement in the underlying condition was the purpose of the care there sought. <i>Farrell,</i> 336 U.S. at 512-13, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104651\"><a href=\"/opinion/104651/farrell-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">707</span></a></span>; <i>Vella,</i> 421 U.S. at 2-3, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109234\"><a href=\"/opinion/109234/vella-v-ford-motor-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1381</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The owner's second argument on this appeal is that the district court erred because the rehabilitation envisaged for Avery is directed in part to coping with muscle spasticity and contractions. The owner says, with some support, that these are mere symptoms of the permanent brain injury. He then argues, blending this new argument into the old, that this shows that curative treatment is no longer available and that any further expenditure for Avery's rehabilitation is not properly one for maintenance and cure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But Avery's doctors clearly opined that he could make further cognitive improvement as a result of treatment &#8212; not just by the passage of time &#8212; and their testimony may also suggest that even his muscle ailments can be permanently lessened. Certainly evidence as to the former supports the district court's finding that \"further rehabilitation would be more than simply palliative, and would improve his medical condition.\" <i>In re RJF,</i> 261 F.Supp.2d at 105. This is enough to support an award of maintenance and cure in aid of permanent improvement short of a complete cure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the owner might have tried to distinguish between curative treatment still possible and accompanying palliative measures, and then argued that the cost of palliation offered in the course of treatment should be segregated and excluded from the owner's obligation. Some segregation would be silly &#8212; imagine excluding pain medicine from the setting of a broken bone &#8212; but perhaps in some settings a distinction might be drawn. Such a distinction could matter because maintenance and cure is exempt from the limitation of liability rules in admiralty. <i>Brister v. A.W.I., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"569320\"><a href=\"/opinion/569320/barry-brister-and-karen-brister-cross-appellees-v-awi-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">946</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></a></span>, 360-61 (5th Cir.1991); <i>see also</i> Gilmore &amp; Black, <i>The Law of Admiralty,</i> at 901-02 (2d ed.1975).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, in this court the owner has adopted an all or nothing approach (although it appears that it did attempt to make a segregation argument in the district court). It is not our task to devise alternative arguments that have not been pressed on appeal. Indeed, such a segregation argument in this case would involve both legal and factual issues of some complexity which neither side has briefed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the owner's claim that the maintenance and cure award should be curtailed because Avery was allegedly eligible for Medicare was not presented in timely fashion in the district court; before the hearing, the owner argued only that medical insurance would cover <i>palliative</i> care, adding tersely that Avery was \"also entitled to Medicare or Medicaid.\" The present claim was raised only in a closing brief intended to sum up <i>after</i> the hearing and not to raise new issues. Thus this argument too must await another day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> <i>See generally Pelotto v.
