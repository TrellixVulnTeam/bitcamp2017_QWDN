Appellant Commercial Union\n\nInsurance    Company      (\"Commercial      Union\")   brought   a   declaratory\n\njudgment action against appellee Dean Pesante (\"Pesante\") in the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Rhode Island,\n\nseeking a declaration that it was not liable under a marine\n\ninsurance policy issued to Pesante for losses incurred by Pesante's\n\nvessel.     During the ensuing litigation, Commercial Union filed a\n\nmotion for summary judgment, which the district court denied.\n\nFollowing the denial, the parties filed a Joint Motion for Entry of\n\nFinal Judgment.        The district court then entered final judgment in\n\nfavor of Pesante.          Commercial Union now appeals the district\n\ncourt's entry of judgment for Pesante and denial of its motion for\n\nsummary judgment.        After careful review, we reverse.\n\n                                        I.\n\n            In 1997, Pesante purchased the F/V Oceana (\"Oceana\").\n\nPesante used the Oceana for gill-net fishing (\"gill netting\"),\n\nwhich entails the use of entangling stationary nets to catch fish.\n\nUntil 2001, Pesante obtained his marine insurance from the Ocean\n\nMarine Insurance Agency.           Due to rising premiums, Pesante decided\n\nto   seek    a   new     policy.       He     contacted   Philip    Christopher\n\n(\"Christopher\") of Christopher & Regan Insurance (\"C & R\") to help\n\nhim obtain a policy with the lowest possible premiums.                 Through\n\nChristopher, Pesante submitted an Application for Fishing Vessel\n\nInsurance (the \"Application\") to Commercial Union on March 23,\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\f2001.     The Application identified the Oceana as a lobster boat.1\n\nPesante has admitted that this was an inaccurate description of the\n\nvessel.2    A document accompanying the Application indicated that\n\nPesante was paying a yearly premium of $1,535 and that C & R needed\n\nto match that premium in order to secure Pesante's business.\n\n            On March 27, 2001, Russell Bond (\"Bond\"), an underwriter\n\nat Commercial Union, faxed Christopher a quote which identified the\n\nOceana as a thirty-eight foot lobster boat and quoted a premium of\n\n$1,550.    In an affidavit, Bond stated that had he known the vessel\n\nwas a gill net vessel, the quote would have been twenty-five\n\npercent higher because gill net vessels pose a higher risk than\n\nlobster vessels.    On March 30, 2001, Christopher responded to Bond\n\nvia fax and requested certain changes.      In his fax, Christopher\n\nalso identified the Oceana as a thirty-eight foot lobster boat.\n\n            On April 5, 2001, Commercial Union issued the policy,\n\nwhich was renewed the following year.      The policy contained an\n\nexpress warranty that \"the only commercial use of the insured\n\nvessel(s) shall be for lobstering.\"    Pesante has admitted that he\n\nnever engaged in lobstering, which he described as \"radically\n\ndifferent\" from gill netting.\n\n\n1\n   Under his prior insurance, Pesante had always identified the\nOceana as a gill net vessel.\n2\n  According to Pesante, Christopher was the one who identified the\nOceana as a lobster vessel and filled out that part of the\nApplication before sending it to Pesante. Pesante claims that he\ndid not notice the mistake.\n\n                                 -3-\n\f             On September 25, 2002, while returning to port from a\n\ngill netting trip, the Oceana was involved in a collision with a\n\nBoston Whaler.     Occupants of the Boston Whaler sustained serious\n\ninjuries and brought claims against the Oceana.               Several months\n\nafter the accident, Pesante sought to correct the policy.                    He\n\ncrossed out \"lobstering\" on the form and sent it to C & R along\n\nwith a handwritten note stating that he had never done lobstering\n\nand   did   not   intend   to    engage    in   lobstering   in   the   future.\n\nChristopher faxed the form and note to Bond on December 30, 2002.\n\nOn December 31, 2002, Commercial Union issued a denial of insurance\n\ncoverage based on Pesante's misrepresentation and breach of the\n\nexpress     warranty   found    in   the   policy.     Commercial   Union,   on\n\nJanuary 22, 2003, issued a reservation of rights letter under which\n\nit agreed to defend the claims arising from the September 25, 2002\n\nincident.\n\n             On May 16, 2003, Commercial Union filed a Petition for\n\nDeclaratory Judgment in the district court seeking a declaration of\n\nits rights and responsibilities under the policy.                 On July 29,\n\n2003, Pesante filed an answer and counterclaim.               On November 3,\n\n2003, Commercial Union filed a motion for summary judgment and\n\nstatement of undisputed material facts.              In its opposition to the\n\nmotion for summary judgment, Pesante stated that Commercial Union's\n\nstatement of undisputed material facts \"appears accurate.\"                   On\n\nMarch 3, 2004, the district court entered its Memorandum and Order\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fdenying Commercial Union's motion for summary judgment.                  The court\n\nbased    its    decision   on     a    finding    that    there   was   no   causal\n\nrelationship between Pesante's breaches and the losses suffered.\n\nThe court reasoned that, since Pesante was steaming home when the\n\naccident   occurred,       he    technically      was    not   gill   netting     and\n\ntherefore was not in breach of the warranty at the time of the\n\nloss.\n\n               On June 21, 2005, the parties executed a stipulation of\n\ndismissal as to Pesante's counterclaim, then filed a Joint Motion\n\nfor Entry of Final Judgment.             In the motion, the parties stated\n\nthat, based on the district court's denial of Commercial Union's\n\nmotion   for     summary   judgment      and     the    stipulated    dismissal   of\n\nPesante's counterclaim, there were no longer any factual matters to\n\nbe resolved at a trial.               On July 20, 2005, the district court\n\nfound that there were no genuine issues of material fact that would\n\nprevent the entry of judgment. It therefore entered final judgment\n\nin favor of Pesante.            Commercial Union has timely appealed from\n\nthis final judgment, arguing that the district court erred in\n\ndenying its motion for summary judgment and entering judgment for\n\nPesante.\n\n                                         II.\n\n               We begin by noting that \"we do not have jurisdiction over\n\ndenials of summary judgment motions . . . where a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact remains in dispute.\"                Rivera-Jiménez v. Pierluisi,\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\f362 F.3d 87, 93 (1st Cir. 2004).            We thus often do not have\n\njurisdiction over denials of motions for summary judgment, because\n\n\"a denial of a motion for summary judgment is merely a judge's\n\ndetermination that genuine issues of material fact exist.             It is\n\nnot a judgment, and does not foreclose trial on issues on which\n\nsummary judgment was sought.\"         Rivera-Torres v. Ortiz Vélez, 341\n\nF.3d 86, 92 (1st Cir. 2004).      Here, however, following the denial\n\nof   summary   judgment   and   the   stipulation   of    dismissal   as   to\n\nPesante's counterclaim, the parties filed a Joint Motion for Entry\n\nof Final Judgment in which they stated that there were no longer\n\nany factual matters to be resolved at a trial.           The district court\n\nagreed and entered final judgment. It is from this final judgment,\n\nbased on undisputed facts, that Commercial Union appeals, and we\n\ntherefore have jurisdiction.      See 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n           Our review of a district court's decision granting or\n\ndenying a summary judgment motion is de novo.             Rodríguez v. Am.\n\nInt'l Ins. Co. of Puerto Rico, 402 F.3d 45, 46 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\nSummary judgment is appropriate \"if the pleadings, depositions,\n\nanswers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with\n\nthe affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to\n\nany material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a\n\njudgment as a matter of law.\"         Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\n\n           Commercial Union makes two arguments on appeal.            First,\n\nit argues that Pesante made a material misrepresentation in his\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fapplication     for    insurance   and   that   the   policy   was    therefore\n\nvoidable under either federal or Rhode Island law.3                  Second, it\n\nargues that Pesante breached an express warranty in the policy --\n\nby using the Oceana for gill netting and not lobstering –- and that\n\nthis breach rendered the policy voidable, regardless of whether\n\nthere   was    any    causal   connection   between    the   breach    and   the\n\naccident.     Because we find the first argument determinative, we do\n\nnot address the second argument.\n\n              This case arises under our admiralty jurisdiction since\n\nit involves a marine insurance policy. Windsor Mount Joy Mut. Ins.\n\nCo. v. Giragosian, 57 F.3d 50, 54 (1st Cir. 1995).             Generally, in\n\ncases involving a marine insurance contract, we will apply state\n\n\n3\n   There appears to have been some confusion as to Commercial\nUnion's argument below.     In its motion for summary judgment,\nCommercial Union argued that Pesante's use of the vessel for gill\nnetting instead of lobstering voided the policy because it affected\nthe insurer's acceptance of risk and premium charged. However,\nCommercial Union labeled this argument not as a \"material\nmisrepresentation\" argument but as a \"breach of warranty\" argument.\nThe district court dismissed the argument, stating that Commercial\nUnion seemed \"to be making a hybrid claim that seeks to convert a\nbreach of warranty occurring after the policy was issued into a\nreason why the breach affected the issuance of the policy.\" On\nappeal, Commercial Union has clarified that it is arguing that the\npolicy is voidable due to a material misrepresentation in the\napplication. We were initially troubled by the confusion below,\ninasmuch as a failure to raise an argument before the district\ncourt generally forfeits the argument, meaning that on appeal we\nwould review only for plain error. See, e.g., Metro. Prop. and\nCas. Ins. Co. v. Shan Trac, Inc., 324 F.3d 20, 24 (1st Cir. 2003).\nHowever, after further consideration, we believe that, while\nCommercial Union could have been clearer about its argument below,\nit adequately raised the issue so as to avoid plain error review.\nWe also note that Pesante has not argued that our review on this\nissue is for plain error.\n\n                                     -7-\n\flaw unless an established \"maritime rule controls the disputed\n\nissue, and that rule is materially different from state law.\"   Id.\n\n(emphasis in original).   Commercial Union argues that the doctrine\n\nof uberrimae fidei is an established rule of maritime law and\n\ndetermines the outcome of this case.      Pesante argues that the\n\ndoctrine of uberrimae fidei is not an established rule of maritime\n\nlaw and that Rhode Island law should therefore apply.\n\n            \"Uberrimae fidei\" roughly means \"of the utmost good\n\nfaith.\"   Grande v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 436 F.3d 277,\n\n282 (1st Cir. 2006).   Under this doctrine, the insured is required\n\n\"to disclose to the insurer all known circumstances that materially\n\naffect the insurer's risk, the default of which . . . renders the\n\ninsurance contract voidable by the insurer.\"   Giragosian, 57 F.3d\n\nat 54-55.     \"[O]ne treatise says that in the marine insurance\n\ncontext, a material fact is 'that which can possibly influence the\n\nmind of a prudent and intelligent insurer in determining whether it\n\nwill accept the risk.'    4A Appleman & Appleman, Insurance Law and\n\nPractice § 2651 (rev. ed. Supp. 2005).\"   Grande, 436 F.3d at 282-\n\n83.   Commercial Union argues that Pesante's failure to disclose\n\nthat the Oceana was a gill netting vessel -- and not a lobster\n\nvessel -- was a material false statement because the underwriter\n\nwould have charged a twenty-five percent higher premium had it\n\nknown that the vessel was used solely for gill netting.   We agree.\n\nTherefore, if we were to find that the doctrine of uberrimae fidei\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fis an established rule of maritime law, we would hold that the\n\npolicy was voidable as a matter of law.\n\n              While we have never actually decided the issue, it is\n\ntrue   that    we   have   questioned   whether       uberrimae    fidei   is   an\n\nestablished rule of maritime law.             See Giragosian, 57 F.3d at 54\n\nn.3.     However, we need not decide the issue today, because even\n\nunder Rhode Island law, the insurance policy was voidable as a\n\nmatter of law due to the misrepresentations in the Application.\n\n              Under Rhode Island law, \"[t]he falsity of any statement\n\nin the application for any policy covered by this chapter may not\n\nbar the right to recovery under the policy unless the false\n\nstatement materially affected either the acceptance of the risk or\n\nthe hazard assumed by the insurer.\"              R.I. Gen. Laws § 27-18-16\n\n(2006).4    The Rhode Island Supreme Court has concluded that, under\n\nthis statute, \"a material misrepresentation, even though innocently\n\nmade, is a basis for rescinding a contract.\"               Guardian Life Ins.\n\nCo. Of Am. v. Tillinghast, 512 A.2d 855, 859 (R.I. 1986).                        A\n\nmaterial      misrepresentation   is    one    that   affects     the   insurer's\n\ndecision to accept the risk and insure the applicant.               See Grande,\n\n436 F.3d at 282-83; Evora v. Henry, 559 A.2d 1038, 1040 (R.I.\n\n1989).     Here, there is uncontroverted testimony that, had the\n\nunderwriter known that the Oceana was used for gill netting and not\n\n\n\n4\n   It is undisputed that the policy at issue here is \"covered by\nthis chapter\" as required by the statute.\n\n                                       -9-\n\flobstering, Pesante would have been charged a premium twenty-five\n\npercent higher than the $1,550 that was quoted.      It is therefore\n\nclear that Commercial Union would not have insured Pesante at the\n\nquoted price had it known the true nature of the vessel's use.       We\n\ntherefore find that the misrepresentation was material.5\n\n           Pesante argues that we should first address the breach of\n\nwarranty issue, looking to whether the alleged breach caused the\n\nharm or whether Pesante was in breach of the policy at the time of\n\nthe accident.     We reject this argument.   Whether Pesante was in\n\nbreach of the express warranty at the time of the accident and\n\nwhether any such breach caused the accident are irrelevant to the\n\nmaterial   misrepresentation   inquiry.   Because   of   the   material\n\nmisrepresentation made in Pesante's application, the policy was\n\nvoidable from the beginning. Under Rhode Island law, the insurer's\n\ndecision to rescind on the basis of the material misrepresentation\n\nmust be upheld.     See Tillinghast, 512 A.2d at 859.     There is no\n\nreason to address the alternative arguments on breach of warranty.\n\n                                 III.\n\n           For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgment of the\n\ndistrict court and direct entry of judgment for Commercial Union.\n\n           Reversed.\n\n\n\n\n5\n   At oral argument, Pesante conceded that the misrepresentation\nwas material.\n\n                                 -10-\n\f",

However, Commercial Union labeled this argument not as a \"material misrepresentation\" argument but as a \"breach of warranty\" argument. The district court dismissed the argument, stating that Commercial Union seemed \"to be making a hybrid claim that seeks to convert a breach of warranty occurring after the policy was issued into a reason why the breach affected the issuance of the policy.\" On appeal, Commercial Union has clarified that it is arguing that the policy is voidable due to a material misrepresentation in the application.

During the ensuing litigation, Commercial Union filed a motion for summary judgment, which the district court denied. Following the denial, the parties filed a Joint Motion for Entry of Final Judgment. The district court then entered final judgment in favor of Pesante. Commercial Union now appeals the district court's entry of judgment for Pesante and denial of its motion for summary judgment.

Pesante used the Oceana for gill-net fishing (\"gill netting\"), which entails the use of entangling stationary nets to catch fish. Until 2001, Pesante obtained his marine insurance from the Ocean Marine Insurance Agency. Due to rising premiums, Pesante decided to seek a new policy. He contacted Philip Christopher (\"Christopher\") of Christopher &amp; Regan Insurance (\"C &amp; R\") to help him obtain a policy with the lowest possible premiums. Through Christopher, Pesante submitted an Application for Fishing Vessel Insurance (the \"Application\") to Commercial Union on March 23, 2001. The Application identified the Oceana as a lobster boat.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Pesante has admitted that this was an inaccurate description of the vessel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> A document accompanying the Application indicated that Pesante was paying a yearly premium of $1,535 and that C &amp; R needed to match that premium in order to secure Pesante's business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 27, 2001, Russell Bond (\"Bond\"), an underwriter at Commercial Union, faxed Christopher a quote which identified the Oceana as a thirty-eight foot lobster boat and quoted a premium of $1,550. In an affidavit, Bond stated that had he known the vessel was a gill net vessel, the quote would have been twenty-five percent higher because gill net vessels pose a higher risk than lobster vessels. On March 30, 2001, Christopher responded to Bond via fax and requested certain changes. In his fax, Christopher also identified the Oceana as a thirty-eight foot lobster boat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 5, 2001, Commercial Union issued the policy, which was renewed the following year. The policy contained an express warranty that \"the only commercial use of the insured vessel(s) shall be for lobstering.\" Pesante has admitted that he never engaged in lobstering, which he described as \"radically different\" from gill netting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 25, 2002, while returning to port from a gill netting trip, the Oceana was involved in a collision with a Boston Whaler. Occupants of the Boston Whaler sustained serious injuries and brought claims against the Oceana. Several months after the accident, Pesante sought to correct the policy. He crossed out \"lobstering\" on the form and sent it to C &amp; R along with a handwritten note stating that he had never done lobstering and did not intend to engage in lobstering in the future. Christopher faxed the form and note to Bond on December 30, 2002. On December 31, 2002, Commercial Union issued a denial of insurance coverage based on Pesante's misrepresentation and breach of the express warranty found in the policy. Commercial Union, on January 22, 2003, issued a reservation of rights letter under which it agreed to defend the claims arising from the September 25, 2002 incident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 16, 2003, Commercial Union filed a Petition for Declaratory Judgment in the district court seeking a declaration of its rights and responsibilities under the policy. On July 29, 2003, Pesante filed an answer and counterclaim. On November 3, 2003, Commercial Union filed a motion for summary judgment and statement of undisputed material facts. In its opposition to the motion for summary judgment, Pesante stated that Commercial Union's statement of undisputed material facts \"appears accurate.\" On March 3, 2004, the district court entered its Memorandum and Order denying Commercial Union's motion for summary judgment. The court based its decision on a finding that there was no causal relationship between Pesante's breaches and the losses suffered.

We therefore find that the misrepresentation was material.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pesante argues that we should first address the breach of warranty issue, looking to whether the alleged breach caused the harm or whether Pesante was in breach of the policy at the time of the accident. We reject this argument. Whether Pesante was in breach of the express warranty at the time of the accident and whether any such breach caused the accident are irrelevant to the material misrepresentation inquiry. Because of the material misrepresentation made in Pesante's application, the policy was voidable from the beginning. Under Rhode Island law, the insurer's decision to rescind on the basis of the material misrepresentation must be upheld. <i>See Tillinghast,</i> 512 A.2d at 859. There is no reason to address the alternative arguments on breach of warranty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgment of the district court and direct entry of judgment for Commercial Union.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Reversed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Under his prior insurance, Pesante had always identified the Oceana as a gill net vessel</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> According to Pesante, Christopher was the one who identified the Oceana as a lobster vessel and filled out that part of the Application before sending it to Pesante.

In its motion for summary judgment, Commercial Union argued that Pesante's use of the vessel for gill netting instead of lobstering voided the policy because it affected the insurer's acceptance of risk and premium charged. However, Commercial Union labeled this argument not as a \"material misrepresentation\" argument but as a \"breach of warranty\" argument. The district court dismissed the argument, stating that Commercial Union seemed \"to be making a hybrid claim that seeks to convert a breach of warranty occurring after the policy was issued into a reason why the breach affected the issuance of the policy.\" On appeal, Commercial Union has clarified that it is arguing that the policy is voidable due to a material misrepresentation in the application. We were initially troubled by the confusion below, inasmuch as a failure to raise an argument before the district court generally forfeits the argument, meaning that on appeal we would review only for plain error<i>See, e.g., Metro. Prop. and Cas. Ins. Co. v. Shan Trac, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200399\"><a href=\"/opinion/200399/metropolitan-v-shan-trac-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">324</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 24 (1st Cir. 2003). However, after further consideration, we believe that, while Commercial Union could have been clearer about its argument below, it adequately raised the issue so as to avoid plain error review. We also note that Pesante has not argued that our review on this issue is for plain error.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> It is undisputed that the policy at issue here is \"covered by this chapter\" as required by the statute</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> At oral argument, Pesante conceded that the misrepresentation was material</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
