Petitioner Amjad Ali Rana, a native and\n\ncitizen of Pakistan, petitions for review of a final order of\n\nremoval from the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\").             His sole\n\nargument in his petition is that the BIA erred in finding him\n\ninadmissible under 8 U.S.C. ยง 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(II), which renders\n\ninadmissible certain aliens who illegally reenter the United States\n\nafter being ordered removed, because he reentered the United States\n\nprior to the statute's effective date.           Rana did not present this\n\nargument to the BIA.\n\n           Exhaustion of administrative remedies is a prerequisite\n\nfor judicial review of a final order of removal from the BIA.               8\n\nU.S.C. ยง 1252(d)(1).      Where, as here, the petitioner fails to\n\npresent   an   argument   to   the   BIA,   he    has   not   exhausted   his\n\nadministrative remedies, see, e.g., Mejia-Rodriguez v.

Gonzales, 415 F.3d 205, 210-11 (1st Cir. 2005), and we lack\n\njurisdiction to decide the issue.\n\n           The petition for review is dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f",
