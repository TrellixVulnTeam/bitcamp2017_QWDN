Juan M. Perez-Gimenez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                  Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                   and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n    Francisco Garcia-Aromi on brief pro se.\n\n\n\n                          June 6, 2002\n\f          Per Curiam.        Francisco Garcia Aromi appeals from\n\nthe district court's dismissal of his civil rights action,\n\nalleging deprivation of his Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment\n\nrights to due process, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.                   The\n\ndistrict court determined that the complaint was barred by the\n\nstatute of limitations.        Upon review, we conclude that the\n\ncomplaint was untimely filed, for essentially the reasons\n\nstated in the district court's order.        We add that the statute\n\nof limitations was not subject to tolling for the reasons\n\nadvanced by Garcia-Aromi.\n          Garcia-Aromi's       assertion     that     the    statute    of\n\nlimitations is tolled until he is released from prison is\nincorrect.    While the accrual period for a § 1983 action is\ngoverned by federal law, tolling is governed by state law.\n\nTorres v. Superintendent of the Police of Puerto Rico, 893 F.2d\n\n404, 407 (1st Cir. 1990).      As we observed in Sierra-Serpa v.\n\nMartinez, 995 F.2d 325 (1st Cir. 1993), following certification\n\nof the question to the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, the\nlegislature of Puerto Rico implicitly repealed the provision of\nthe code of civil procedure that had excluded time spent in\n\nprison from a limitations period.\n          Garcia-Aromi also argues, for the first time on\nappeal, that the statute of limitations should be equitably\n\ntolled.   \"No precept is more firmly settled in this circuit\nthan   that   theories   not    squarely     raised    and    seasonably\n\npropounded    before   the   trial   court   cannot    rewardingly     be\n\n                                 -2-\n\fadvanced on appeal.\"      Lawton v. State Mut. Life Assurance Co.,\n\n101 F.3d 218, 222 (1st Cir. 1996).        Thus, where a plaintiff\n\nfails to present arguments to the district court, we have\nrefused to consider those arguments for the first time on\n\nappeal.   See, e.g., Landrau-Romero v. Banco Popular De Puerto\n\nRico, 212 F.3d 607, 612 (1st Cir. 2000) (refusing to consider\nplaintiff's    argument     that   equitable   tolling   saved   his\n\nemployment discrimination claim when that argument was not made\n\nto the district court).     By failing to present to the district\n\ncourt his argument that equitable tolling applied to his case,\n\nAromi waived the issue.\n\n            The district court’s dismissal of the complaint is\n\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\f",
