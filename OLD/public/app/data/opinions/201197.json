Plaintiff-appellant Judith Díaz-Santos appeals\n\nfrom    the   district     court’s    dismissal      of   her    employment\n\ndiscrimination claim for failure to prosecute.                We affirm the\n\ndismissal.\n\n                              I. BACKGROUND\n\n       Díaz-Santos, a teacher employed by the Department of Education\n\nof the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (DOE), initiated a complaint\n\nwith the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission during the 1991-\n\n1992 school year.     The gist of her complaint was that she suffered\n\nfrom a mental disability that prevented her from working directly\n\nwith children.      The matter concluded with a negotiated settlement\n\nagreement providing certain accommodations under the Americans With\n\nDisabilities Act, (ADA)), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.             Accordingly,\n\nDíaz-Santos was reassigned to the Superintendent’s office.\n\n       On August 26, 1999, Díaz-Santos filed a complaint alleging\n\nemployment discrimination in violation of the ADA and Title VII of\n\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq.                  The\n\ncomplaint named as defendants the DOE and Victor Fajardo, the\n\nSecretary of the DOE, for allegedly reassigning her in violation of\n\nthe    settlement    agreement,   subjecting   her   to   a   hostile   work\n\nenvironment, and refusing to promote her and/or consider her for\n\npositions for which she was qualified.          Díaz-Santos amended her\n\ncomplaint in February, 2000.\n\n       On July 6, 2000, defendants moved to dismiss the amended\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fcomplaint without prejudice.       On October 31, the district court\n\nallowed the motion in part, dismissing Díaz-Santos’s claims of\n\ndiscrimination under Title I of the ADA.         The court, however,\n\npermitted the claim of retaliation under Title V of the ADA to\n\nproceed.\n\n     On April 4, 2002, defendants sought an interlocutory appeal of\n\nthe district court’s decision, which they voluntarily dismissed\n\nseveral months later.      On December 27, 2002, after a number of\n\npretrial    conferences,   trial   was   set   for   March    17,   2003.\n\nThereafter, the district court stated in an order dated January 15,\n\n2003, that “[t]his case seems to be a very good candidate for a\n\nsensible settlement disposition.     Parties [are] ordered to explore\n\nalternatives and report to the court within 30 days.         Case remains\n\nfirmly set for trial in March.”\n\n     In an order dated March 3, 2003, after setting forth the terms\n\nof a tentative settlement agreement, the court stated:\n\n     [S]hould the case not be finally settled on or before\n     March 21, 2003, then trial will go forward either during\n     the last week of March or the first week of April . . .\n     The parties shall be given twenty-four hours notice to\n     begin trial, and shall be prepared to proceed on that\n     notice or face dismissal for want of prosecution.\n\nThat trial date was reiterated as \"firm and final\" in subsequent\n\norders.    During the months of March and April of 2003, the district\n\ncourt continued to conduct settlement conferences.\n\n     On April 3, the court again stated in a procedural order that\n\nit was in the parties’ interest to reach settlement.         It noted,\n\n                                   -3-\n\f       The defendant has been willing to consider reasonable\n       terms for settlement. However, the plaintiff continues\n       to have unrealistic expectations about what she may be\n       entitled to under the law.     Plaintiff’s counsel will\n       consult with his client again and review the possibility\n       of, as well as the terms of, settlement. He shall notify\n       the court . . . of the status of settlement by April 18,\n       2003.\n\n       On    May   1,   Díaz-Santos’s        counsel   moved   to       withdraw\n\nrepresentation on the ground that Díaz-Santos “can’t, has not and\n\nwill not, in any way help, aid, abet or assist counsel in a\n\ndecisive, practicable and sound defense of her best interests.” On\n\nJune 22, 2003, the court allowed the motion and permitted Díaz-\n\nSantos until July 23, 2003, to obtain new counsel and have him or\n\nher make an appearance.        It set that date as a “final term,” and\n\nthreatened that should Díaz-Santos not comply, “the case will be\n\ndismissed.”\n\n       On July 23, a “Special Appearance to Request an Extension of\n\nTime to Retain Counsel” was filed on Díaz-Santos’s behalf.                     It\n\nrequested an additional forty-five days for new counsel to evaluate\n\nthe case and obtain relevant records from Díaz-Santos’s prior\n\ncounsel.      No further submissions were filed on behalf of Díaz-\n\nSantos, and the district court took no action until September 29,\n\n2003   –    sixty-six   days   after   the   initial   deadline     –   when   it\n\ndismissed Díaz-Santos’s claims for lack of diligent prosecution.\n\nIt stated in its order: “The court has been patient to the extreme\n\nin dealing with this case.         For months now, Plaintiff has been\n\nunable or unwilling to resolve this case by settlement and/or\n\n                                       -4-\n\fsecure legal representation as previously ordered.”          Judgment was\n\nentered that day.\n\n     On December 18, 2003, the court denied reconsideration of its\n\norder and judgment, and Díaz-Santos filed a timely appeal.\n\n                             II. DISCUSSION\n\n     A district court's inherent powers to sanction parties for\n\nlitigation abuses include the power to act sua sponte to dismiss a\n\nsuit for failure to prosecute.      Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S.\n\n32, 43 n.8 (1991); Pomales v. Celulares Telefonica, Inc., 342 F.3d\n\n44, 48 (1st Cir. 2003).      We review such a dismissal pursuant to an\n\nabuse of discretion standard.     Bachier-Ortíz v. Colón-Mendoza, 331\n\nF.3d 193, 194 (1st Cir. 2003).           \"We do not lightly disturb a\n\ndistrict court's ruling -- but 'dismissal should not be viewed\n\neither as a sanction of first resort or as an automatic penalty for\n\nevery failure to abide by a court order.'\"        Id. at 194-95 (quoting\n\nYoung v. Gordon, 330 F.3d 76, 81 (1st Cir. 2003)).\n\n     Díaz-Santos claims three points of error: that the district\n\ncourt abused its discretion in dismissing the case for failure to\n\nprosecute; that it abused its discretion in denying her motion for\n\nreconsideration of that order; and that the court erred by allowing\n\ndefendants’ motion to dismiss her claim under Title I of the ADA.\n\nWe review each argument in turn.\n\nA.   Dismissal for failure to prosecute\n\n     First,   we   address    whether    the   district   court   erred   in\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fdismissing Díaz-Santos’s complaint for failure to prosecute. In so\n\ndoing, we consider the totality of the circumstances.           Bachier-\n\nOrtiz, 331 F.3d at 195. Of particular importance are whether Díaz-\n\nSantos prosecuted her claims diligently until the time when she\n\nparted ways with her counsel; whether the district court provided\n\nDíaz-Santos fair warning of its inclination to employ such a severe\n\nsanction; and whether the delay she caused constituted misconduct\n\n\"sufficiently   extreme    to   justify   dismissal   with   prejudice.\"\n\nPomales, 342 F.3d at 49.\n\n     Díaz-Santos does not fare well under any of these factors.\n\nFirst, her conduct prior to her original counsel’s withdrawal can\n\nhardly be characterized as diligent. The district court repeatedly\n\nindicated its frustration as to the parties’ lack of preparedness,\n\ntheir delays as trial approached, and Díaz-Santos’s failure to\n\nsettle the case.1   The court noted that Díaz-Santos “continue[d] to\n\nhave unrealistic expectations” as to the strength of her case after\n\nseveral settlement conferences.     This observation was confirmed by\n\nDíaz-Santos’s former counsel in its motion to withdraw.\n\n     Second, the district court provided unambiguous notice of its\n\nintent to dismiss the case should Díaz-Santos not comply with its\n\nJune 22, 2003 order permitting Díaz-Santos one month to obtain new\n\ncounsel.   Indeed, the court had warned that it would not hesitate\n\n\n     1\n     We note that defendants appear to have some culpability as\nwell in dilatory conduct occurring prior to the settlement\nconferences.\n\n                                   -6-\n\fto dismiss the case for failure to prosecute as early as March 3,\n\nwhen it set forth the terms of a tentative settlement agreement.\n\n       Third, we see no reason to second-guess the district court’s\n\ndetermination     that    Díaz-Santos’s   delay   constituted     sufficient\n\nmisconduct to warrant dismissal with prejudice.             Initially, the\n\ncourt’s June 22 order was not heeded, at least not fully: while new\n\ncounsel did make an appearance, it was only conditional in nature,\n\nand sought additional time in which to determine whether it would\n\ntake   on   the   representation.     Then,   Díaz-Santos    far    exceeded\n\ncounsel's requested extension without taking action before the\n\ndistrict court finally dismissed her complaint.                 Under these\n\nconditions, we think the court demonstrated both ample patience and\n\nfairness.\n\n       Díaz-Santos argues that her new counsel lacked documents that\n\nwere    necessary    to    assess   the   case    and   provide     adequate\n\nrepresentation.     Even assuming that the new counsel was acting in\n\ngood faith, there appears to be no viable excuse for allowing\n\nsixty-six additional days to pass in total silence after the filing\n\nof the notice of special appearance.        Particularly in light of the\n\ndistrict court’s emphasis of the finality of the July 23 deadline\n\nfor obtaining new counsel, it remained Díaz-Santos’s duty to inform\n\nthe court of any obstacles and seek an additional continuance if\n\n\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fone was required.2      Although the remedy of dismissal with prejudice\n\nwas, perhaps, somewhat harsh, it did not exceed the district\n\ncourt's discretion.\n\nB.    Motion for reconsideration\n\n      We   review   a    district   court's     denial   of   a    motion    for\n\nreconsideration     under    Fed.   R.   Civ.    P.   59(e)   for    abuse    of\n\ndiscretion.   Rivera v. P. R. Aqueduct & Sewers Auth., 331 F.3d 183,\n\n192 (1st Cir. 2003).        Here, Díaz-Santos contends that defendants\n\nwere also culpable in the delays and reiterates her argument that\n\nshe   did not receive important documents until after the July 23\n\ndeadline had passed.        Although there is some indication in the\n\nrecord that defendants, too, engaged in foot-dragging, it seems to\n\nbe limited to the early part of the litigation.                   The district\n\ncourt's order was based, inter alia, on Díaz-Santos's failure to\n\ncomply with a deadline for securing new counsel –- conduct that has\n\nno relation to any action of the defendants -- and it is on that\n\nbasis that we affirm the district court's judgment.\n\nC.    Title I appeal\n\n      Lastly, we consider Díaz-Santos’s argument that the court\n\nerred in dismissing her claim under Title I of the ADA based upon\n\nher failure to allege sufficient facts to establish a prima facie\n\ncase of disability pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 12101(2).                We do not\n\n\n\n      2\n     We do not suggest that had Díaz-Santos moved for additional\ntime, the district court would have been obliged to allow it.\n\n                                     -8-\n\freach the merits of this issue, however, because it is beyond the\n\nscope of this appeal.\n\n      Normally, a notice of appeal that designates the final\n\njudgment encompasses not only that judgment, but also all earlier\n\ninterlocutory    orders    that     merge      in    the    judgment.        John's\n\nInsulation, Inc. v. L. Addison & Assocs. Inc., 156 F.3d 101, 105\n\n(1st Cir. 1998)(cases cited therein).                  In John's Insulation,\n\nhowever,   we   joined    the    majority      of   other   circuit     courts   in\n\nrecognizing     an   exception      to    that      rule    and    holding      that\n\ninterlocutory rulings do not merge into a judgment of dismissal for\n\nfailure to prosecute, and thus are unappealable.                  Id. at 107.\n\n     Because we affirm the district court's dismissal for failure\n\nto prosecute, we do not address the dismissal of the Title I claim\n\nfurther.   \"[I]f a complaint was correctly dismissed for failure to\n\nprosecute, the fact that earlier interlocutory rulings may have\n\nbeen erroneous is irrelevant.\"           Id.\n\n                                III. CONCLUSION\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court's\n\ndismissal.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\f",

No further submissions were filed on behalf of Díaz-\n\nSantos, and the district court took no action until September 29,\n\n2003   –    sixty-six   days   after   the   initial   deadline     –   when   it\n\ndismissed Díaz-Santos’s claims for lack of diligent prosecution.\n\nIt stated in its order: “The court has been patient to the extreme\n\nin dealing with this case.         For months now, Plaintiff has been\n\nunable or unwilling to resolve this case by settlement and/or\n\n                                       -4-\n\fsecure legal representation as previously ordered.”          Judgment was\n\nentered that day.\n\n     On December 18, 2003, the court denied reconsideration of its\n\norder and judgment, and Díaz-Santos filed a timely appeal.\n\n                             II. DISCUSSION\n\n     A district court's inherent powers to sanction parties for\n\nlitigation abuses include the power to act sua sponte to dismiss a\n\nsuit for failure to prosecute.      Chambers v.

We review such a dismissal pursuant to an\n\nabuse of discretion standard.     Bachier-Ortíz v.

Gordon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200491\"><a href=\"/opinion/200491/young-v-gordon/\"><span class=\"volume\">330</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">76</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 81 (1st Cir. 2003)).\n\n     Díaz-Santos claims three points of error: that the district\n\ncourt abused its discretion in dismissing the case for failure to\n\nprosecute; that it abused its discretion in denying her motion for\n\nreconsideration of that order; and that the court erred by allowing\n\ndefendants’ motion to dismiss her claim under Title I of the ADA.\n\nWe review each argument in turn.\n\nA.   Dismissal for failure to prosecute\n\n     First,   we   address    whether    the   district   court   erred   in\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fdismissing Díaz-Santos’s complaint for failure to prosecute. In so\n\ndoing, we consider the totality of the circumstances.           Bachier-\n\nOrtiz, 331 F.3d at 195. Of particular importance are whether Díaz-\n\nSantos prosecuted her claims diligently until the time when she\n\nparted ways with her counsel; whether the district court provided\n\nDíaz-Santos fair warning of its inclination to employ such a severe\n\nsanction; and whether the delay she caused constituted misconduct\n\n\"sufficiently   extreme    to   justify   dismissal   with   prejudice.\"\n\nPomales, 342 F.3d at 49.\n\n     Díaz-Santos does not fare well under any of these factors.\n\nFirst, her conduct prior to her original counsel’s withdrawal can\n\nhardly be characterized as diligent. The district court repeatedly\n\nindicated its frustration as to the parties’ lack of preparedness,\n\ntheir delays as trial approached, and Díaz-Santos’s failure to\n\nsettle the case.1   The court noted that Díaz-Santos “continue[d] to\n\nhave unrealistic expectations” as to the strength of her case after\n\nseveral settlement conferences.     This observation was confirmed by\n\nDíaz-Santos’s former counsel in its motion to withdraw.\n\n     Second, the district court provided unambiguous notice of its\n\nintent to dismiss the case should Díaz-Santos not comply with its\n\nJune 22, 2003 order permitting Díaz-Santos one month to obtain new\n\ncounsel.   Indeed, the court had warned that it would not hesitate\n\n\n     1\n     We note that defendants appear to have some culpability as\nwell in dilatory conduct occurring prior to the settlement\nconferences.\n\n                                   -6-\n\fto dismiss the case for failure to prosecute as early as March 3,\n\nwhen it set forth the terms of a tentative settlement agreement.\n\n       Third, we see no reason to second-guess the district court’s\n\ndetermination     that    Díaz-Santos’s   delay   constituted     sufficient\n\nmisconduct to warrant dismissal with prejudice.             Initially, the\n\ncourt’s June 22 order was not heeded, at least not fully: while new\n\ncounsel did make an appearance, it was only conditional in nature,\n\nand sought additional time in which to determine whether it would\n\ntake   on   the   representation.     Then,   Díaz-Santos    far    exceeded\n\ncounsel's requested extension without taking action before the\n\ndistrict court finally dismissed her complaint.                 Under these\n\nconditions, we think the court demonstrated both ample patience and\n\nfairness.\n\n       Díaz-Santos argues that her new counsel lacked documents that\n\nwere    necessary    to    assess   the   case    and   provide     adequate\n\nrepresentation.     Even assuming that the new counsel was acting in\n\ngood faith, there appears to be no viable excuse for allowing\n\nsixty-six additional days to pass in total silence after the filing\n\nof the notice of special appearance.        Particularly in light of the\n\ndistrict court’s emphasis of the finality of the July 23 deadline\n\nfor obtaining new counsel, it remained Díaz-Santos’s duty to inform\n\nthe court of any obstacles and seek an additional continuance if\n\n\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fone was required.2      Although the remedy of dismissal with prejudice\n\nwas, perhaps, somewhat harsh, it did not exceed the district\n\ncourt's discretion.\n\nB.    Motion for reconsideration\n\n      We   review   a    district   court's     denial   of   a    motion    for\n\nreconsideration     under    Fed.   R.   Civ.    P.   59(e)   for    abuse    of\n\ndiscretion.   Rivera v. P. R. Aqueduct & Sewers Auth., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"782203\"><a href=\"/opinion/782203/mayra-rosario-rivera-v-puerto-rico-aqueduct-and-sewers-authority-jose-ivan/\"><span class=\"volume\">331</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">183</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n192 (1st Cir. 2003).        Here, Díaz-Santos contends that defendants\n\nwere also culpable in the delays and reiterates her argument that\n\nshe   did not receive important documents until after the July 23\n\ndeadline had passed.        Although there is some indication in the\n\nrecord that defendants, too, engaged in foot-dragging, it seems to\n\nbe limited to the early part of the litigation.                   The district\n\ncourt's order was based, inter alia, on Díaz-Santos's failure to\n\ncomply with a deadline for securing new counsel –- conduct that has\n\nno relation to any action of the defendants -- and it is on that\n\nbasis that we affirm the district court's judgment.\n\nC.    Title I appeal\n\n      Lastly, we consider Díaz-Santos’s argument that the court\n\nerred in dismissing her claim under Title I of the ADA based upon\n\nher failure to allege sufficient facts to establish a prima facie\n\ncase of disability pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 12101(2).                We do not\n\n\n\n      2\n     We do not suggest that had Díaz-Santos moved for additional\ntime, the district court would have been obliged to allow it.\n\n                                     -8-\n\freach the merits of this issue, however, because it is beyond the\n\nscope of this appeal.\n\n      Normally, a notice of appeal that designates the final\n\njudgment encompasses not only that judgment, but also all earlier\n\ninterlocutory    orders    that     merge      in    the    judgment.        John's\n\nInsulation, Inc. v. L. Addison & Assocs. Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198117\"><a href=\"/opinion/198117/johns-v-l-addison/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">101</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 105\n\n(1st Cir. 1998)(cases cited therein).                  In John's Insulation,\n\nhowever,   we   joined    the    majority      of   other   circuit     courts   in\n\nrecognizing     an   exception      to    that      rule    and    holding      that\n\ninterlocutory rulings do not merge into a judgment of dismissal for\n\nfailure to prosecute, and thus are unappealable.                  Id. at 107.\n\n     Because we affirm the district court's dismissal for failure\n\nto prosecute, we do not address the dismissal of the Title I claim\n\nfurther.   \"[I]f a complaint was correctly dismissed for failure to\n\nprosecute, the fact that earlier interlocutory rulings may have\n\nbeen erroneous is irrelevant.\"           Id.\n\n                                III. CONCLUSION\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court's\n\ndismissal.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\f</pre>",
