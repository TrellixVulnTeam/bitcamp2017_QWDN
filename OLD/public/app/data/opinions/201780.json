DELGADO-HERNANDEZ,\n\n                      Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                 FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n        [Hon. Jay A. García-Gregory, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                    Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                  Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n\n     Ben T. Clements, with whom Clements & Clements, LLP was on\nbrief, for appellant.\n     Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nH.S. Garcia, United States Attorney, was on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n                         August 24, 2005\n\f                  LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.            Defendant-appellant Ehrick F.\n\nDelgado-Hernández seeks to set aside his guilty plea to the charge\n\nof possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking\n\noffense          because    of    alleged   errors    in   the   plea   proceedings.\n\nAlthough the plea proceedings in this case raised some problems,\n\nDelgado has not met his heavy burden of establishing that any\n\ndeficiencies in the proceedings below amounted to plain error.\n\nTherefore, we affirm his conviction.1\n\n                                              I.\n\n                  On April 28, 2003, Delgado pled guilty to one count of\n\nconspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute\n\ncocaine and heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846 (Count One), and\n\none count of possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug-\n\ntrafficking offense in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A) (Count\n\nTwo).       Pursuant to a plea agreement, Delgado stipulated that the\n\ndrug conspiracy in Count One involved three kilograms of cocaine.\n\nBased       on    that     drug   quantity,    Delgado's    leading     role   in   the\n\nconspiracy, his acceptance of responsibility, and his Criminal\n\nHistory Category (II), the district court sentenced Delgado on July\n\n28, 2003 to 84 months (7 years) of imprisonment for the conspiracy\n\n\n\n        1\n      Delgado's appeal was consolidated with that of a co-defendant\nfor purposes of oral argument. Because the issues raised in the\nappeals are unrelated, we have severed the appeals for purposes of\ndecision. See United States v. Barnes, 244 F.3d 172, 175 n.2 (1st\nCir. 2001). We issue both decisions today. See United States v.\nDe Los Santos, No. 03-2436 (1st Cir. Aug. 24, 2005).\n\n                                            -2-\n\fconviction and a consecutive term of 60 months (5 years) of\n\nimprisonment for the firearm possession conviction, for a total of\n\n144 months (12 years) of imprisonment.             The court also ordered\n\nDelgado to forfeit $111,000 and imposed a 4-year term of supervised\n\nrelease and a special monetary assessment of $200.\n\n            Delgado timely appealed, seeking to vacate his conviction\n\non the firearm possession charge in Count Two only, on the grounds\n\nthat the court (1) misinformed him of the nature of the charge in\n\nviolation of Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(b)(1)(G) and his constitutional\n\nright to due process, and (2) entered judgment on his guilty plea\n\nin the absence of a factual basis in violation of Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n11(b)(3).\n\n                                     II.\n\nA.          Requirements of Rule 11\n\n            In order to be constitutionally valid, a guilty plea must\n\nbe voluntary and intelligent.        Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S.\n\n614, 618 (1998).    \"[A] plea does not qualify as intelligent unless\n\na criminal defendant first receives 'real notice of the true nature\n\nof   the   charge   against   him,   the   first    and   most   universally\n\nrecognized requirement of due process.'\"            Id. (quoting Smith v.\n\nO'Grady, 312 U.S. 329, 334 (1941)). \"[E]nsuring that the defendant\n\nunderstands the elements of the charges that the prosecution would\n\nhave to prove at trial\" is also \"a 'core concern' of Rule 11.\"\n\nUnited States v. Gandia-Maysonet, 227 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f(quoting United States v. Hernandez-Wilson, 186 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.\n\n1999)).     Accordingly,   Rule   11   requires   that   a   court,   before\n\naccepting a guilty plea, \"inform the defendant of, and determine\n\nthat the defendant understands, . . . (G) the nature of each charge\n\nto which the defendant is pleading.\"       Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(b)(1).2\n\n            Furthermore, \"because a guilty plea is an admission of\n\nall the elements of a formal criminal charge, it cannot be truly\n\nvoluntary unless the defendant possesses an understanding of the\n\nlaw in relation to the facts.\"     McCarthy v. United States, 394 U.S.\n\n459, 466 (1969).   Rule 11 therefore requires a court to \"determine\n\nthat there is a factual basis for the plea\" before entering\n\njudgment.   Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(b)(3).3     This additional procedural\n\nrequirement \"'protect[s] a defendant who is in the position of\n\npleading voluntarily with an understanding of the nature of the\n\ncharge but without realizing that his conduct does not actually\n\nfall within the charge.'\" United States v. Ventura-Cruel, 356 F.3d\n\n55, 59-60 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting Fed. R. Crim. P. 11, advisory\n\ncommittee's note (1966 amendment)).\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      Former Rule 11(c)(1) was recodified as Rule 11(b)(1)(G) in\nDecember 2002. According to the advisory committee's note to the\n2002 amendment, the change \"[is] intended to be stylistic only.\"\n     3\n      Former Rule 11(f) was recodified as Rule 11(b)(3) in December\n2002. This change \"[is] intended to be stylistic only.\" Fed. R.\nCrim. P. 11, advisory committee's note (2002 amendment).\n\n                                   -4-\n\fB.            Plain Error Review\n\n              \"Under ordinary circumstances, we review the district\n\ncourt's acceptance of a guilty plea for abuse of discretion.\"\n\nUnited States v. Negrón-Narváez, 403 F.3d 33, 37 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nHowever, because Delgado failed to call the district court's\n\nattention to the alleged errors in the plea proceedings \"despite\n\nhaving had ample opportunity to do so,\" for example, by seeking to\n\nwithdraw his plea prior to sentencing pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n11(d)(2), his claim is subject only to plain error review on direct\n\nappeal.       Id.     \"The defendant's burden under the plain error\n\nstandard is a heavy one.\"           United States v. Ramirez-Benitez, 292\n\nF.3d 22, 27 (1st Cir. 2002).         In order to prevail on either of his\n\nchallenges, Delgado must show \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which\n\nwas   clear    or   obvious   and   which    not    only    (3)   affected    [his]\n\nsubstantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness,\n\nintegrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"                    United\n\nStates v. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n              To demonstrate the requisite effect on his substantial\n\nrights, Delgado must \"show a reasonable probability that, but for\n\nthe error, he would not have entered the [guilty] plea.\"                     United\n\nStates v. Dominguez-Benitez, 542 U.S. 74, ___, 124 S. Ct. 2333,\n\n2336 (2004).        \"A defendant must thus satisfy the judgment of the\n\nreviewing      court,   informed     by     the    entire    record,   that     the\n\nprobability of a different result is sufficient to undermine\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fconfidence   in    the   outcome    of    the    proceeding.\"       Id.   at   2340\n\n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n                                        III.\n\n           We set forth the procedural backdrop for Delgado's claims\n\nin considerable detail, noting several troubling missteps on the\n\npart of the government that went undetected by the court.                 While we\n\nultimately   conclude     that     Delgado      has   not   met   his   burden   of\n\nestablishing plain error with respect to either of his claims, the\n\ngovernment's      carelessness     in    making   its   record     in   this   case\n\nhampered not only our ability to review Delgado's claims on appeal,\n\nbut also the district court's ability to evaluate the factual basis\n\nfor his guilty plea.\n\nA.         The Plea Colloquies\n\n           Delgado's change-of-plea hearing took place on April 28,\n\n2003.   After determining that Delgado had received a copy of the\n\ncharges against him and had \"fully discussed those charges and the\n\ncase in general with . . . counsel,\" the court described the drug\n\nconspiracy charge as listed in Count One of the indictment to\n\nDelgado:\n\n           [Y]ou have been charged in a superseding\n           indictment that . . . beginning not later than\n           December 2000 through on or about December\n           2001, in the District of Puerto Rico and\n           elsewhere within the jurisdiction of the\n           Court, you, together with 14 other co-\n           defendants, did knowingly, unlawfully and\n           intentionally, combine, conspire and agree\n           with one another and with others to the grand\n           jury known and unknown, to commit an offense\n\n                                         -6-\n\f          defined in Title 21, U.S. Code, Section\n          841(a)(1), that is, to possess with the intent\n          to distribute and to distribute more than one\n          kilogram of heroin, a Schedule I controlled\n          substance, and more than five kilograms of\n          cocaine, a Schedule II controlled substance,\n          in violation of Title 21, U.S. Code, Section\n          846.\n\nThe court then described the firearm possession charge in Count Two\n\nof the indictment:\n\n          You have also been charged with Count Two that\n          states that on diverse occasions from December\n          2000 through December 2001, in the District of\n          Puerto Rico and within the jurisdiction of the\n          court, you, as a defendant, did knowingly\n          possess a firearm in furtherance of a drug\n          trafficking crime, to wit: an unlawful\n          conspiracy to possess and distribute heroin\n          and cocaine, in violation of Title 21, U.S.\n          Code, Section 846, and in violation of Title\n          18, U.S. Code, 924(c)(1)(A).\n\n          The court next proceeded to explain to Delgado the nature\n\nof the charges against him:\n\n          Now, to be found guilty of this offense if a\n          trial were to be held, the Government would\n          have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that\n          you unlawfully, willfully, knowingly[,] and\n          intentionally combined, conspired, and agreed\n          with the other co-defendants and with others\n          to the grand jury known and unknown to commit\n          the offense that I have previously described\n          as well as the count concerning the possession\n          of the firearm in connection with the drug\n          trafficking crime.\n                 And, of course, then there are the\n          forfeiture allegations.\n                 Do you understand what I have just\n          explained?\n\nDelgado responded, \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f               The government then summarized its evidence in support of\n\nthe drug conspiracy charge in Count One.4              The government stated\n\nthat if Delgado had chosen to face trial on that charge, it would\n\nhave produced evidence in the form of:\n\n               the testimony of witnesses and most notably\n               recordings of calls intercepted pursuant to\n               the   authorized  Title   [III]  wiretap   on\n               [Delgado's] telephones that would have shown\n               that beginning not later than December of\n               2000, [Delgado] agreed with others to smuggle\n               quantities of cocaine and heroin into Puerto\n               Rico.\n\nThe government further stated that it would introduce evidence that\n\n\"on   several      occasions    [Delgado]     sought   to   acquire   kilogram\n\nquantities of cocaine in Puerto Rico\" and \"negotiated to purchase\n\nheroin and cocaine from persons outside the United States in\n\noutfitted go-fast boats [speed boats] to smuggle cocaine and heroin\n\ninto Puerto Rico.\"        The government concluded by stating that it\n\nwould       introduce   evidence    that   \"this    defendant   and   his    co-\n\nconspirators distributed these narcotics for sale to other persons\n\nfor further sale to consumers in Puerto Rico and New York.\"\n\n               Despite its recitation of facts in support of the drug\n\nconspiracy charge in Count One, the government neglected to present\n\nany facts whatsoever in support of the firearm possession charge in\n\nCount       Two.   Similarly,      although   the   government's   proffer    of\n\n\n\n        4\n      Delgado does not dispute the factual basis for his guilty\nplea to Count One; nor does he appeal his conviction or sentence on\nthat charge.\n\n                                        -8-\n\fevidence in support of the drug conspiracy charge in Count One\n\nreflected the contents of the statement of facts that Delgado\n\nsigned as an attachment to his plea agreement, that statement of\n\nfacts contains no description of the factual predicate for the\n\nfirearm possession charge in Count Two. Nevertheless, Delgado pled\n\nguilty to both counts in the indictment.\n\n            On May 2, 2003, the government acknowledged its error and\n\nmoved to hold a supplemental Rule 11 hearing \"to ensure that the\n\ndefendant acknowledges and admits the factual basis for his plea\"\n\nof guilty to the firearm possession charge.      In its motion, the\n\ngovernment indicated that it had already presented the evidence\n\nestablishing the factual basis for the firearm possession charge\n\nduring evidentiary hearings before a magistrate judge on Delgado's\n\nmotion to suppress a firearm seized from his rental car when\n\nfederal agents executed arrest and search warrants at his apartment\n\non December 10, 2001.    According to the government's motion, the\n\nevidence providing a factual basis for the firearm possession\n\ncharge consisted of: (1) the seized firearm and (2) \"intercepted\n\npertinent   conspiracy-related   telephone   conversations   in   which\n\n[Delgado] spoke of his possession of a firearm.\"      The government\n\ndid not attach transcripts or descriptions of the recorded phone\n\ncalls to its motion.    Instead, the government requested that the\n\ncourt \"take notice of its own record of the evidence presented\n\nduring the [suppression] hearings.\"\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f            On June 20, 2003, the court held a supplemental Rule 11\n\nhearing in response to the government's motion of May 2, 2003.\n\nDuring the supplemental hearing, the government again \"invite[d]\n\nthe Court's attention to its own records from the [suppression\n\nhearing] in which [intercepted telephone] calls were introduced in\n\nevidence.\"     After explaining the purpose for the supplemental\n\nhearing to Delgado, the court described the firearm possession\n\ncharge in Count Two as set forth in the indictment, just as it had\n\nduring the first Rule 11 hearing on April 28, 2003.               The court\n\ncontinued: \"as counsel for the Government has stated, you know,\n\nthere was a motion to suppress that was filed in this case, and I\n\ntake judicial notice of the prior record in this case that states\n\nmore or less the facts underlying that Count Two.\"          The court did\n\nnot further specify which parts of the record it was relying on or\n\nwhich facts supplied a basis for the charge.         It did, however, make\n\nreference    later   in   the   hearing   to   its   \"adopt[ion    of]   the\n\n[m]agistrate[] [judge's] version of the facts as stated in his\n\nreport and recommendation\" on Delgado's suppression motion.\n\n            The government then stated that if the case had proceeded\n\nto trial, it would have introduced the evidence it had already\n\npresented during the suppression hearing, namely, the \"pistol\n\n[seized] from [Delgado's rental] car outside of his apartment\" and\n\ntranscripts of intercepted phone calls \"in which in coded language\n\n[Delgado] in two of these calls, discussed the possession of the\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\ffirearm in connection with the drug activities.\"          The government\n\ndid not elaborate further on the nature or contents of the phone\n\ncalls.\n\n            Delgado's counsel added only that \"when the firearm was\n\nseized from that automobile, Mr. Delgado Hernandez was in his\n\napartment and not in the automobile.         That's, I think, factually\n\ncorrect.\"    The court then asked Delgado if he \"agree[d] with the\n\nGovernment's version that you just heard with respect to Count\n\nTwo.\"    After consulting with counsel, Delgado replied, \"Yes, your\n\nHonor.\"     Delgado then pled guilty a second time to the firearm\n\npossession charge in Count Two.\n\n            The presentence investigation report that was sent to\n\nDelgado and to the government on June 23, 2003, just after the\n\nsupplemental Rule 11 hearing and prior to Delgado's sentencing on\n\nJuly 28, 2003, does not mention any facts in support of the firearm\n\npossession charge in Count Two.\n\nB.          The Suppression Hearings\n\n            The suppression hearings that the government and the\n\ndistrict    court   referred   to   during   the   supplemental   Rule   11\n\nproceeding, and that the court took judicial notice of, took place\n\nbefore the magistrate judge on March 9, 2003 and March 26, 2003.\n\nDuring the suppression proceedings, Delgado argued that the firearm\n\nseized from his rental car was inadmissible in the government's\n\ncase-in-chief at trial because he had not validly consented to the\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fsearch of the car after agents arrested him and during the search\n\nof his apartment pursuant to a warrant.\n\n            At the hearing on March 26, 2003, a Drug Enforcement\n\nAdministration (\"DEA\") agent testified that, based on cell phone\n\nconversations intercepted during the drug conspiracy investigation\n\npursuant to a court order, the agents had reason to believe Delgado\n\npossessed a firearm when they executed the search and arrest\n\nwarrants.      In support of this testimony, the government played\n\nduring   the    hearing     four   excerpts    from   recordings   of   three\n\nintercepted phone conversations between Delgado and others, all of\n\nwhich were conducted in Spanish.            The government referred to the\n\nexcerpts as recordings #316, #70, #71, and #572.\n\n            Based on his knowledge of the investigation, the DEA\n\nagent testified that Delgado was the person referred to in the\n\ncalls as \"Frank.\" The agent identified the person Delgado spoke to\n\nin one of the calls (#316) as the mother of Delgado's former wife,\n\nbut did not ascribe any drug-related activity to her.              The agent\n\nwas not asked to identify any of the speakers in the second set of\n\ncall excerpts (#70 and #71).        However, in response to questioning\n\nabout an apparent reference in the excerpts to a boat, the agent\n\ntestified      that    Delgado's   drug-trafficking     activity    included\n\n\"coordinat[ing] possible shipments of narcotics by boat into Puerto\n\nRico\" and \"contract[ing] people . . . to get boats for him and to\n\nwork for him.\"        Finally, the agent identified the person with whom\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fDelgado spoke in the third phone call (#572) as a co-defendant who\n\nworked with Delgado \"in distributing drugs here in Puerto Rico.\"\n\nThe transcripts of the suppression hearing contain no indication of\n\nwhen or in what context a firearm is mentioned in the call\n\nexcerpts.\n\n            After the excerpts were played, the DEA agent testified\n\nthat, during the search of Delgado's apartment, another agent asked\n\nDelgado whether he kept a firearm in a safe in his apartment, and\n\nDelgado replied that he kept a gun in the car.      The agent testified\n\nthat Delgado then identified the car key to the agents, who\n\nsubsequently found a semi-automatic pistol in Delgado's rental car,\n\nwhich was parked outside the apartment.           No drugs were seized\n\nduring the search of the apartment or the car.\n\n            On March 27, 2003, the magistrate judge issued a report\n\nand   recommendation   to   deny   Delgado's   motion   to   suppress   the\n\nfirearm, finding that Delgado had validly consented to the search\n\nof the car.     The magistrate judge also noted that, \"[b]ased on\n\ninformation acquired via [court-authorized] intercepts, the agents\n\nbelieved defendant carried a firearm\" (footnote omitted).               The\n\ndistrict court adopted the report and recommendation on April 21,\n\n2003.5    Delgado's initial change-of-plea hearing took place one\n\n\n\n\n      5\n      Delgado does not challenge the denial of his motion to\nsuppress the firearm.\n\n                                   -13-\n\fweek later, on April 28, 2003, and the supplemental plea colloquy\n\nwas held on June 20, 2003.\n\n           The transcript of the suppression hearing indicates that\n\nthe   government   provided   English-language    translations    of    the\n\nintercepted phone calls that were played during the hearing to both\n\nDelgado and the magistrate judge. After the calls were played, the\n\ngovernment   provided   copies   of   the   translations   to   the    court\n\ninterpreter for certification.6       The magistrate judge's report and\n\nrecommendation, which was issued the next day, on March 27, 2003,\n\nfurther indicates that \"[t]he English language translations of the\n\n[recordings played during the hearing] shall be certified by the\n\ncourt interpreter and be made part of the record.\"7         However, the\n\nrecord on appeal contains no trace of the translations, certified\n\nor uncertified, nor any indication that they were ever made part of\n\nthe record below.\n\n\n\n\n      6\n      Delgado raised no objection to the accuracy                 of    the\ntranslations during or after the suppression hearing.\n      7\n      \"All pleadings and proceedings in the United States District\nCourt for the District of Puerto Rico shall be conducted in the\nEnglish language.\"    48 U.S.C. § 864.

Government's Supplementation of the Record During Direct\n                 Appeal\n\n                 After oral argument in the instant appeal and upon\n\nnotification by the district court of the absence of the English-\n\nlanguage translations of the intercepted phone calls from the\n\nrecord,         the   government    was    unable    to   locate   copies   of   the\n\ntranslations that had been provided to Delgado, the magistrate\n\njudge, and the court interpreter during the suppression hearing.\n\nInstead, the government moved before the district court on June 13,\n\n2005 to supplement the record with newly translated transcripts of\n\nthe intercepted phone calls, which were completed and certified on\n\nJune       2,    2005,   and   to    have    those    transcripts    \"transmitted\n\nexpeditiously to the Court of Appeals.\"                    See Fed. R. App. P.\n\n10(e)(2)(B) (district court may supplement the record \"before or\n\nafter [it] has been forwarded\" to the court of appeals).                         The\n\ndistrict court granted the motion on June 14, 2005,8 and the\n\ntranslated transcripts have been provided to us.\n\n                                            IV.\n\nA.               Nature of the Firearm Possession Charge\n\n                 We first address Delgado's claim that the district court\n\ncommitted plain error by misinforming him of the nature of the\n\nfirearm possession charge.                The statute under which Delgado was\n\n\n       8\n      On June 30, 2005, this court granted Delgado's motion for\nleave to file a response to the government's submission of the\nnewly translated transcripts that had been transmitted to this\ncourt. We discuss that response below in Part IV.B.\n\n                                           -15-\n\fcharged   and   convicted   of   firearm   possession,   18   U.S.C.\n\n§ 924(c)(1)(A), provides, in relevant part:\n\n          [A]ny person who, during and in relation to\n          any crime of violence or drug trafficking\n          crime . . . for which the person may be\n          prosecuted in a court of the United States,\n          uses or carries a firearm, or who, in\n          furtherance of any such crime, possesses a\n          firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment\n          provided for such crime of violence or drug\n          trafficking crime--\n\n          (i) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of\n          not less than 5 years . . . .\n\n(Emphasis added).   In order to convict Delgado, the government\n\nwould have had to prove at trial (1) that he committed the\n\nunderlying drug-trafficking crime, (2) that he knowingly possessed\n\na firearm, and (3) that he did so in furtherance of the specified\n\ndrug-trafficking crime. See United States v. Flecha-Maldonado, 373\n\nF.3d 170, 179 (1st Cir. 2004) (describing \"basic elements\" of\n\n§ 924(c)(1) violation for using or carrying a firearm during and in\n\nrelation to a drug-trafficking crime); see also United States v.\n\nCruz, 352 F.3d 499, 509 (1st Cir. 2003) (\"[G]iven the text of the\n\nstatute, merely determining that [a defendant] was in possession of\n\na [firearm] is not enough to support [a] conviction; we must also\n\nconsider whether the weapon was possessed 'in furtherance of . . .\n\na drug-trafficking crime.'\") (quoting § 924(c)(1)(A)) (ellipsis in\n\noriginal).\n\n          During both the initial plea colloquy on April 28, 2003\n\nand the supplemental colloquy on June 20, 2003, the court correctly\n\n                                 -16-\n\fdescribed Count Two of the indictment as charging Delgado with\n\npossession of a firearm \"in furtherance of\" a drug-trafficking\n\noffense. However, when the court explained to Delgado the elements\n\nthe government would have to prove at trial during the initial\n\ncolloquy on April 28, 2003, it stated:\n\n          Now, to be found guilty of this offense if a\n          trial were to be held, the Government would\n          have to prove . . . the count concerning the\n          possession of the firearm in connection with\n          the drug trafficking crime.\n\n(Emphasis added.)9   Delgado argues that, far from ensuring that he\n\nunderstood the elements of the firearm possession charge against\n\nhim, the court misstated the requisite nexus between the firearm\n\npossession and the drug-trafficking offense, in violation of Rule\n\n11(b)(1)(G) and his right to due process.\n\n          The   statutory   language   prohibiting   possession   of   a\n\nfirearm \"in furtherance of\" the underlying crime was inserted into\n\n§ 924(c)(1) by amendment in 1998.      Congress thus \"broadened § 924\n\nto sweep in the mere possession\" of firearms, in addition to the\n\nuse or carrying of firearms, but \"only when . . . possessed 'in\n\nfurtherance of' the underlying crime.\"     United States v. Castillo,\n\n406 F.3d 806, 812 (7th Cir. 2005).       As the House Report on the\n\n\n\n     9\n      During the supplemental Rule 11 hearing on June 20, 2003, the\ngovernment repeated the court's phrasing by stating that its\nevidence in support of a factual basis for the firearm possession\ncharge included intercepted phone calls \"in which in coded language\n[Delgado] in two of these calls, discussed the possession of the\nfirearm in connection with the drug activities\" (emphasis added).\n\n                                -17-\n\famendment indicates, the \"in furtherance of\" element of a firearm\n\npossession charge imposes a \"slightly higher standard\" of liability\n\nthan the nexus element corresponding to the different charges of\n\nusing or carrying a firearm, which need only occur \"during and in\n\nrelation to\" the underlying crime.         H.R. Rep. No. 105-344, at 11\n\n(1997) (\"House Report\").      To establish the \"in furtherance of\"\n\nrequirement of a firearm possession charge under § 924(c)(1),\n\n          [t]he government must clearly show that a\n          firearm was possessed to advance or promote\n          the commission of the underlying offense. The\n          mere presence of a firearm in an area where a\n          criminal act occurs is not a sufficient basis\n          for   imposing    this  particular   mandatory\n          sentence.      Rather, the government must\n          illustrate through specific facts, which tie\n          the defendant to the firearm, that the firearm\n          was possessed to advance or promote the\n          criminal activity.\n\nHouse Report at 12 (emphases added); see also United States v.\n\nGrace, 367 F.3d 29, 35 (1st Cir. 2004) (analyzing \"in furtherance\n\nof\" element of § 924(c)(1)); accord Castillo, 406 F.3d at 813-14\n\n(interpretation   of   \"in   furtherance    of\"   to   mean   \"furthering,\n\nadvancing or helping forward\" comports with legislative history and\n\npurpose of § 924(c), as well as case law of all circuit courts)\n\n(citation omitted).\n\n          Delgado argues that \"in furtherance of\" means something\n\ndistinct from \"in connection with\" when used to describe the\n\nrelationship between possession of a firearm and the commission of\n\na drug-trafficking crime.       We agree that the two phrases have\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\fdifferent      meanings,   and   that    possession        of    a   firearm    \"in\n\nfurtherance of\" a drug-trafficking crime suggests something more by\n\nway of nexus between the possession and the crime than the phrase\n\n\"in connection with.\"      Compare American Heritage Dictionary of the\n\nEnglish Language 714 (4th ed. 2000) (defining \"furtherance\" as\n\n\"[t]he act of furthering, advancing, or helping forward\") with id.\n\nat 390 (defining \"connection\" as \"[a]n association or relationship\"\n\nor   \"[r]eference     or   relation      to     something       else\").10      Rule\n\n11(b)(1)(G), however, \"does not require the court to explain the\n\ntechnical intricacies of the charges in the indictment.\"                    United\n\nStates    v.    Cruz-Rivera,     357    F.3d    10,   13    (1st     Cir.   2004).\n\nOrdinarily, a court may ascertain that a defendant is aware of the\n\nnature of the charge against him by reading the charge in the\n\nindictment      to   the   defendant      and    obtaining        his   competent\n\nacknowledgment that he understands the charge.                  See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Ramirez-Benitez, 292 F.3d 22, 27 (1st Cir. 2002) (finding\n\n\"no error, let alone plain error,\" where \"[t]he terms of the\n\n\n\n     10\n      Two sentencing guidelines permit increases in a defendant's\nbase offense level for possession of a firearm.       See U.S.S.G.\n§ 2K2.1(b)(5) (authorizing increase for possession of a firearm \"in\nconnection with\" certain felony offenses) (emphasis added);\nU.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(1) (authorizing increase for drug offenses\n\"[i]f a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed\"); see\nalso U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1, cmt. n.3 (U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(1) \"should be\napplied if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable\nthat the weapon was connected with the offense. For example, the\nenhancement would not be applied if the defendant, arrested at his\nresidence, had an unloaded hunting rifle in the closet.\") (emphasis\nadded).\n\n                                       -19-\n\findictment alone sufficed to put [the defendant] on notice of the\n\ncharge to which he was pleading guilty.             [The defendant] admitted\n\nhe understood the charge and the court found him competent to\n\nplead.\").11\n\n              Furthermore, we have recently recognized that the meaning\n\nof firearm possession \"in furtherance of\" a drug-trafficking crime\n\nis fluid.      \"One might expect with such a common criminal offense\n\nthat the legal framework would be well settled, but, as is so often\n\nthe case with general statutory terms, it is not.\"                  United States\n\nv. Felton, Nos. 02-2414, 03-1089, 03-1441, 2005 U.S. App. LEXIS\n\n15607, at *17 (1st Cir. July 29, 2005).          We therefore conclude that\n\nany error in the district court's use of \"in connection with\" to\n\nmean \"in furtherance of,\" if error there was, was far from obvious.\n\nCf.     Gandia-Maysonet,          227   F.3d   at      5     (court      erred   in\n\n\"affirmatively . . . misstat[ing] the scienter element\" through\n\nomission of carjacking statute's requirement of intent to kill or\n\ncause bodily harm).\n\n              Moreover, even if we were to assume, arguendo, that the\n\ncourt      plainly   erred   by   understating   the       nature   of   the   nexus\n\nrequirement of the firearm possession charge, Delgado has not\n\n\n      11\n       While Delgado invokes his right to due process, he does not\nseriously argue that any error in the court's explanation of the\ncharge rises to the level of a constitutional violation. In any\nevent, the record amply demonstrates that \"the [plea] colloquy was\nconstitutionally sufficient to ensure that [Delgado] made an\nintelligent plea.\"    See Medina-Roman, 376 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.\n2004).\n\n                                        -20-\n\festablished     that   the    difference   in    degree    between    the   two\n\nformulations affected his substantial rights.             See Negrón-Narváez,\n\n403 F.3d at 37; see also United States v. Hernández-Albino, 177\n\nF.3d 33, 41 (1st Cir. 1999) (assuming, arguendo, that court's\n\nfailure to include \"in relation to\" in jury instruction for charge\n\nof   carrying   a   firearm    \"during   and    in   relation   to\"   a   drug-\n\ntrafficking offense \"was error and that the error was plain,\"\n\ndefendant failed to show prejudice under plain error review).\n\nDuring the initial colloquy on April 28, 2003, the court asked\n\nDelgado whether he had received a copy of the charges against him,\n\nas well as whether he had discussed those charges with counsel.\n\nDelgado replied unequivocally that he had. Both the indictment and\n\nthe plea agreement that Delgado signed correctly use the statutory\n\n\"in furtherance of\" language to describe the firearm possession\n\ncharge.\n\n           To be sure, \"Rule 11 is disserved\" if a defendant chooses\n\nwhether to proceed to trial \"based on a misappreciation of the\n\nweight -- light or heavy -- of the government's burden as to a\n\ncharge and its elements.\"       United States v. Medina-Roman, 376 F.3d\n\n1, 7 (1st Cir. 2004).        On one side of the balance, Delgado argues\n\nthat the government's circumstantial evidence that he possessed a\n\nfirearm \"in furtherance of\" a drug-trafficking offense was weak.12\n\n\n      12\n      As we discuss below in Part IV.B., based on our review of the\nentire record, we reject Delgado's independent claim that there was\nno factual basis for the \"in furtherance of\" element of the firearm\n\n                                    -21-\n\fOn the other side of the balance rest the firearm itself, which was\n\nadmissible at trial, and Delgado's admission, supported by the\n\ngovernment's   wiretap   and    other        proffered    evidence,      that   he\n\nconspired to smuggle cocaine by speed boat into Puerto Rico for\n\nfurther distribution and sale. Given the weight of the evidence as\n\na whole, Delgado fails to demonstrate a reasonable probability\n\nthat, although he entered a guilty plea when the charge against him\n\nwas explained as possession of a firearm \"in connection with\" a\n\ndrug-trafficking crime, he would have chosen to face trial if the\n\ncharge had instead been described as possession of a firearm \"in\n\nfurtherance of\" a drug-trafficking crime.              See Dominguez-Benitez,\n\n124 S. Ct. at 2336.\n\nB.        Factual Basis for the Firearm Possession Charge\n\n          Delgado    argues    that    apart    from     the   court's    alleged\n\nmisstatement of the \"in furtherance of\" element of the firearm\n\npossession charge, the court erred by accepting and entering\n\njudgment on his guilty plea in the absence of a sufficient factual\n\nbasis, in violation of Rule 11(b)(3).             Delgado does not dispute\n\nthat he knowingly possessed a firearm, nor that he committed a\n\ndrug-trafficking crime by participating in the drug conspiracy to\n\nwhich he pled guilty in Count One.           He challenges only the factual\n\nbasis for the \"in furtherance of\" element of the firearm possession\n\ncharge, arguing that the government's proffered evidence during the\n\n\npossession charge.\n\n                                      -22-\n\fsupplemental Rule 11 hearing fails to establish the requisite nexus\n\nbetween his possession of the firearm and his drug-trafficking\n\noffense.\n\n             When    determining      whether   a   sufficient    factual    basis\n\nexists to support a guilty plea, the question before the court \"is\n\nnot whether a jury would, or even would be likely, to convict: it\n\nis whether there is enough evidence so that the plea has a rational\n\nbasis in facts that the defendant concedes or that the government\n\nproffers as supported by credible evidence.\"                Gandia-Maysonet, 227\n\nF.3d at 6.    In other words, there must be \"an admission, colloquy,\n\nproffer, or some other basis for thinking that the defendant is at\n\nleast arguably guilty.\"         Id.\n\n             As     the   government     recognized      when     it     sought    a\n\nsupplemental Rule 11 hearing in its motion of May 2, 2003, no facts\n\nsupporting the firearm possession charge (apart from those also\n\nsupporting the underlying drug-trafficking charge) were set forth\n\nduring the initial plea colloquy on April 28, 2003, and no such\n\nfacts   appeared     in   the   signed    statement    of    facts     attached   to\n\nDelgado's plea agreement.          When the court held the supplemental\n\nRule 11 hearing on June 20, 2003, the government stated only, in\n\nconclusory fashion, that Delgado had \"discussed the possession of\n\nthe firearm in connection with [his] drug activities\" during\n\nconspiracy-related phone calls, and referred the court to the\n\nrecord of the hearings on Delgado's suppression motion.\n\n\n                                        -23-\n\f            Although the record of those hearings contains evidence\n\nthat   Delgado     possessed   a    firearm,   it   does   not   contain   the\n\ngovernment's promised evidence demonstrating the requisite nexus\n\nbetween Delgado's firearm possession and the drug conspiracy.\n\nWhile the translated transcripts of the intercepted phone calls\n\nthat were played in Spanish during the suppression hearing may very\n\nwell have contained relevant facts, those transcripts are not part\n\nof the record of that hearing.\n\n            The magistrate judge's tangential observation in his\n\nMarch 27, 2003 report and recommendation on Delgado's suppression\n\nmotion     that,   \"[b]ased    on    information    acquired     via   [court-\n\nauthorized] intercepts, the [DEA] agents believed defendant carried\n\na firearm\" (footnote omitted), establishes only what Delgado does\n\nnot dispute: that he possessed a firearm. Although the phone calls\n\nwere intercepted pursuant to a court order as part of a drug\n\nconspiracy investigation, the government played the calls during\n\nthe suppression hearing only to support the DEA agent's testimony\n\nthat the agents had reason to believe Delgado had a firearm when\n\nthey elicited his valid consent to their search of his rental car,\n\nnot to show that Delgado possessed the firearm for any particular\n\npurpose.    Indeed, the transcript of the hearing fails to indicate\n\nwhen and in what context the phone calls refer to a firearm.               The\n\nfacts and circumstances of the firearm's seizure from Delgado's\n\nrental car, which was parked outside his apartment, in which no\n\n\n                                     -24-\n\fdrugs or drug activity were detected, also shed no light on the\n\nrelationship between the firearm and Delgado's drug-trafficking\n\nactivities.\n\n           As a result of these gaps in the record, the court's\n\njudicial notice of the suppression motion proceedings -- taken at\n\nthe government's urging -- contributes nothing to the factual basis\n\nfor the \"in furtherance of\" element of the firearm possession\n\ncharge; there simply were no pertinent facts in the record of which\n\nto take notice.    Finally, the presentence investigation report,\n\nfrom which the district court could have gleaned a factual basis\n\n\"[b]efore entering judgment on [Delgado's] guilty plea,\" Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 11(b)(3), contains no facts whatsoever relating to the\n\nfirearm possession charge.    Under these circumstances, the court\n\nhad no way of evaluating the factual basis for Delgado's guilty\n\nplea.\n\n           Because the government's proffered evidence lacked a\n\nrational basis in facts for the \"in furtherance of\" element of the\n\nfirearm possession charge, the district court erred in determining\n\nthat there was an adequate factual predicate for Delgado's guilty\n\nplea.   Although discovery of the error required examination of the\n\nsuppression hearing record, we could readily discern the absence of\n\nthe facts represented by the government to exist in that record.\n\n           It is not enough, however, for a defendant facing plain\n\nerror review of his claim to establish that an \"error\" occurred and\n\n\n                                -25-\n\fthat it was \"plain.\"       He must also show that the error \"affected\n\nhis   substantial    rights,      and    that   it    seriously      impaired   the\n\nfairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceeding.\"\n\nNegrón-Narváez, 403 F.3d at 37.\n\n           \"[I]n assessing the effect of Rule 11 error, a reviewing\n\ncourt must look to the entire record, not to the plea proceedings\n\nalone . . . .\"      Dominguez-Benitez, 124 S. Ct. at 2338.               Based on\n\nour review of the entire record, we conclude that despite the\n\ndeficiencies in the government's proffer of evidence, Delgado was\n\nnot \"in the position of pleading voluntarily with an understanding\n\nof the nature of the charge but without realizing that his conduct\n\n[did] not actually fall within the charge.\"                   Ventura-Cruel, 356\n\nF.3d at 59-60 (internal quotation marks omitted). To the contrary,\n\nas we discuss below, the record shows that the government disclosed\n\nevidence   to    Delgado   that    was    sufficient     to    support    the   \"in\n\nfurtherance of\" element.          Delgado thus fails to convince us that\n\nthere is a \"reasonable probability that, but for\" the court's\n\ninability to consider that evidence during the plea proceedings,\n\n\"he would not have entered the [guilty] plea.\"                Dominguez-Benitez,\n\n124 S. Ct. at     2336.\n\n           The    record   as   supplemented         after    oral   argument   now\n\ncontains certified English translations of the intercepted phone\n\ncalls played during the suppression hearing.                  In his response to\n\nthe government's submission of the newly translated transcripts,\n\n\n                                        -26-\n\fDelgado   does   not   dispute    the   accuracy   of   the   government's\n\ntranslations or seek to strike them from the record; rather, he\n\nargues that the government's belatedly filed translations only\n\nserve to confirm its lack of evidence supporting a factual basis\n\nfor his guilty plea because the certified translations contain no\n\nexplicit reference either to a firearm or to Delgado's drug-\n\ntrafficking activities.\n\n            We are aided in our evaluation of the likelihood of a\n\ndifferent   outcome    by   one   additional   document,   which   we   have\n\nexcavated from the record without the assistance of the parties.\n\nThat document is the government's \"Informative Motion Regarding\n\nAnticipated Evidence\" as to Delgado and his co-defendants, filed on\n\nApril 9, 2003, after the suppression hearings took place before the\n\nmagistrate judge on March 9 and 26, 2003 and before the district\n\ncourt adopted the magistrate judge's report and recommendation to\n\ndeny Delgado's motion to suppress on April 21, 2003.13              In its\n\ninformative motion, the government stated its intent to prepare and\n\nprovide to Delgado a single compact disc containing the three\n\nrecorded phone calls purportedly relating to Delgado's possession\n\nof a firearm.    The motion then provides brief descriptions of the\n\n\n     13\n      Because there is no indication in the record that the\ngovernment or the district court referred to or relied on the\ninformative motion to support a factual basis for Delgado's guilty\nplea at the time of the supplemental Rule 11 hearing or before\nentry of the judgment of conviction, we consider the motion only at\nthe prejudice stage (rather than the error stage) of our plain\nerror analysis.\n\n                                    -27-\n\fcontents of each phone call. No transcripts, whether in Spanish or\n\nEnglish, are attached to the motion.\n\n          Contrary to Delgado's argument, the contents of the\n\ntranslated transcripts provide a sufficient factual basis for the\n\n\"in furtherance of\" element of the firearm possession charge to\n\nwhich Delgado pled guilty.      The descriptions in the government's\n\ninformative motion further confirm the existence of a factual basis\n\nfor Delgado's guilty plea.      We set forth the descriptions of the\n\nintercepted   phone   calls   contained   in   the   informative   motion,\n\njuxtaposed with the newly filed translations of the calls, below:14\n\n          CALL EXCERPT #316 (recorded September 25, 2001):\n\n          Informative Motion (April 9, 2003):\n\n          Frank tells Chris [Liliana's mother] that he\n          has to carry a gun because he has hundreds of\n          problems.\n\n          (Alteration in original.)\n\n          Certified Translation (June 2, 2005):\n\n          [DELGADO]:    Because I tell her, 'look, look\n                        I'm   going   to   take  care   of\n                        everything.'

Delgado also notes that although he\n\nrefers to \"problems\" in call excerpt #316, the DEA agent testified\n\nduring the suppression hearing that he was not personally aware of\n\nany \"problems\" that Delgado had in his drug-trafficking activities.\n\nWe    add   that   the   translated   transcript     of     call    excerpt     #572\n\nindicates that any reference to Delgado's \"tools,\" as described in\n\nthe informative motion, is \"inaudible.\"\n\n              While the government's evidence supporting a factual\n\npredicate for the \"in furtherance of\" element, as contained in the\n\ntranslations of the phone calls, may not be iron-clad, the factual\n\nbasis for a guilty plea need only consist of \"enough evidence so\n\nthat    the   plea   has   a   rational   basis    in   facts\"      --   that    is,\n\n\n                                      -32-\n\f\"some . . . basis for thinking that the defendant is at least\n\narguably guilty,\" Gandia-Maysonet, 227 F.3d at 6.          Further, the\n\nfactual basis for certain elements may be inferred from other facts\n\nadmitted by the defendant or proffered by the government.             See\n\nUnited States v.

The\n\nexcerpts also contain references to people who could reasonably be\n\ninferred to be co-conspirators in a plan to use boats to smuggle\n\ndrugs; the references in the translations to people who variously\n\n\"talk too much,\" \"compromis[e] me,\" and are \"going to get it,\"\n\nfurther suggest that Delgado possessed the firearm either to\n\nprotect himself when \"people let [him] down\" or to make threats of\n\nforce to eliminate potential obstacles to the success of the\n\nconspiracy.     These inferences are reinforced by the government's\n\ndescriptions in the informative motion, the accuracy of which\n\n\n                                 -33-\n\fDelgado   has   also   never   challenged,   which   contain   explicit\n\nreferences to a \"gun\" and Delgado's \"tools,\" again in contexts\n\nsupporting the inference that Delgado possessed a firearm to\n\npromote the drug conspiracy in which he participated.\n\n          Because the record as a whole contains a \"rational basis\n\nin facts\" to support Delgado's guilty plea,      Gandia-Maysonet, 227\n\nF.3d at 6, Delgado fails to establish prejudice resulting from the\n\ncourt's inability to evaluate the factual basis proffered by the\n\ngovernment during the proceedings below.\n\n                                  V.\n\n          Because Delgado has not met his burden under plain error\n\nreview on either of his claims of error in the plea proceedings\n\nbelow, we affirm Delgado's conviction for possession of a firearm\n\nin furtherance of a drug-trafficking offense.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -34-\n\f",

Pursuant to a plea agreement, Delgado stipulated that the drug conspiracy in Count One involved three kilograms of cocaine. Based on that drug quantity, Delgado's leading role in the conspiracy, his acceptance of responsibility, and his Criminal History Category (II), the district court sentenced Delgado on July 28, 2003 to 84 months (7 years) of imprisonment for the conspiracy conviction and a consecutive term of 60 months (5 years) of imprisonment for the firearm possession conviction, for a total of 144 months (12 years) of imprisonment.

However, because Delgado failed to call the district court's attention to the alleged errors in the plea proceedings \"despite having had ample opportunity to do so,\" for example, by seeking to withdraw his plea prior to sentencing pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(d)(2), his claim is subject only to plain error review on direct appeal. <i>Id.</i> \"The defendant's burden under the plain error standard is a heavy one.\" <i>United States v.</i> <i>Ramirez-Benitez,</i> 292 F.3d 22, 27 (1st Cir.2002).

While we ultimately conclude that Delgado has not met his burden of establishing plain error with respect to either of his claims, the government's carelessness in making its record in this case hampered not only our ability to review Delgado's claims on appeal, but also the district court's ability to evaluate the factual basis for his guilty plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Plea Colloquies</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Delgado's change-of-plea hearing took place on April 28, 2003. After determining that Delgado had received a copy of the charges against him and had \"fully discussed those charges and the case in general with . . . counsel,\" the court described the drug conspiracy charge as listed in Count One of the indictment to Delgado:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Y]ou have been charged in a superseding indictment that . . . beginning not later than December 2000 through on or about December 2001, in the District of Puerto Rico and elsewhere within the jurisdiction of the Court, you, together with 14 other co-defendants, did knowingly, unlawfully and intentionally, combine, conspire and agree with one another and with others to the grand jury known and unknown, to commit an offense defined in Title 21, U.S.Code, Section 841(a)(1), that is, to possess with the intent to distribute and to distribute more than one kilogram of heroin, a Schedule I controlled substance, and more than five kilograms of cocaine, a Schedule II controlled substance, in violation of Title 21, U.S.Code, Section 846.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then described the firearm possession charge in Count Two of the indictment:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You have also been charged with Count Two that states that on diverse occasions from December 2000 through December 2001, in the District of

distribute heroin and cocaine, in violation of Title 21, U.S.Code, Section 846, and in violation of Title 18, U.S.Code, 924(c)(1)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span

<span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, to be found guilty of this offense if a trial were to be held, the Government would have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that you unlawfully, willfully, knowingly[,] and intentionally combined, conspired, and agreed with the other co-defendants and with others to the grand jury known and unknown to commit the offense that I have previously described as well as the count concerning the possession of the firearm in connection with the drug trafficking crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span

responded, \"Yes, sir.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government then summarized its evidence in support of the drug conspiracy charge in Count One.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The government stated that if Delgado had chosen to face trial on that charge, it would have produced evidence in the form of:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the testimony of witnesses and most notably recordings of calls intercepted pursuant to the authorized Title [III] wiretap on [Delgado's] telephones that would have shown that beginning not later than December of 2000, [Delgado] agreed with others to smuggle quantities of cocaine and heroin into Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government further stated that it would introduce evidence that \"on several occasions [Delgado] sought to acquire kilogram quantities of cocaine in Puerto Rico\" and \"negotiated to purchase heroin and cocaine from persons outside the United States in outfitted go-fast boats [speed boats] to smuggle cocaine and heroin into Puerto Rico.\" The government concluded by stating that it would introduce evidence that \"this defendant and his co-conspirators distributed these narcotics for sale to other persons for further sale to consumers in Puerto Rico and New York.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite its recitation of facts in support of the drug conspiracy charge in Count One, the government neglected to present any facts whatsoever in support of the firearm possession charge in Count Two. Similarly, although the government's proffer of evidence in support of the drug conspiracy charge in Count One reflected the contents of the statement of facts that Delgado signed as an attachment to his plea agreement, that statement of facts contains no description of the factual predicate for the firearm possession charge in Count Two. Nevertheless, Delgado pled guilty to both counts in the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 2, 2003, the government acknowledged its error and moved to hold a supplemental Rule 11 hearing \"to ensure that the defendant acknowledges and admits the factual basis for his plea\" of guilty to the firearm possession charge. In its motion, the government indicated that it had already presented the evidence establishing the factual basis for the firearm possession charge during evidentiary hearings before a magistrate judge on Delgado's motion to suppress a firearm seized from his rental car when federal agents executed arrest and search warrants at his apartment on December 10, 2001. According to the government's motion, the evidence providing a factual basis for the firearm possession charge consisted of: (1) the seized firearm and (2) \"intercepted pertinent conspiracy-related telephone conversations in which [Delgado] spoke of his possession of a firearm.\" The government did not attach transcripts or descriptions of the recorded phone calls to its motion. Instead, the government requested that the court \"take notice of its own record of the evidence presented during the [suppression] hearings.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 20, 2003, the court held a supplemental Rule 11 hearing in response to the government's motion of May 2, 2003. During the supplemental hearing, the government again \"invite[d] the Court's attention to its own records from the [suppression hearing] in which [intercepted telephone] calls were introduced in evidence.\" After explaining the purpose for the supplemental hearing to Delgado, the court described the firearm possession charge in Count Two as set forth in the indictment, just as it had during the first Rule 11 hearing on April 28, 2003. The court continued: \"as counsel for the Government has stated, you know, there was a motion to suppress that was filed in this case, and I take judicial notice of the prior record in this case that states more or less the facts underlying that Count Two.\" The court did not further specify which parts of the record it was relying on or which facts supplied a basis for the charge. It did, however, make reference later in the hearing to its \"adopt[ion of] the [m]agistrate[] [judge's] version of the facts as stated in his report and recommendation\" on Delgado's suppression motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government then stated that if the case had proceeded to trial, it would have introduced the evidence it had already presented during the suppression hearing, namely, the \"pistol [seized] from [Delgado's rental] car outside of his apartment\" and transcripts of intercepted phone calls \"in which in coded language [Delgado] in two of these calls, discussed the possession of the firearm in connection with the drug activities.\" The government did not elaborate further on the nature or contents of the phone calls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Delgado's counsel added only that \"when the firearm was seized from that automobile, Mr. Delgado Hernandez was in his apartment and not in the automobile. That's, I think, factually correct.\" The court then asked Delgado if he \"agree[d] with the Government's version that you just heard with respect to Count Two.\" After consulting with counsel, Delgado replied, \"Yes, your Honor.\" Delgado then pled guilty a second time to the firearm possession charge in Count Two.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The presentence investigation report that was sent to Delgado and to the government on June 23, 2003, just after the supplemental Rule 11 hearing and prior to Delgado's sentencing on July 28, 2003, does not mention any facts in support of the firearm possession charge in Count Two.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Suppression Hearings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The suppression hearings that the government and the district court referred to during the supplemental Rule 11 proceeding, and that the court took judicial notice of, took place before the magistrate judge on March 9, 2003 and March 26, 2003. During the suppression proceedings, Delgado argued that the firearm seized from his rental car was inadmissible in the government's case-in-chief at trial because he had not validly consented to the search of the car after agents arrested him and during the search of his apartment pursuant to a warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the hearing on March 26, 2003, a Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") agent testified that, based on cell phone conversations intercepted during the drug conspiracy investigation pursuant to a court order, the agents had reason to believe Delgado possessed a firearm when they executed the search and arrest warrants. In support of this testimony, the government played during the hearing four excerpts from recordings of three intercepted phone conversations between Delgado and others, all of which were conducted in Spanish. The government referred to the excerpts as recordings # 316, # 70, # 71, and # 572.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on his knowledge of the investigation, the DEA agent testified that Delgado was the person referred to in the calls as \"Frank.\" The agent identified the person Delgado spoke to in one of the calls (# 316) as the mother of Delgado's former wife, but did not ascribe any drug-related activity to her. The agent was not asked to identify any of the speakers in the second set of call excerpts (# 70 and # 71). However, in response to questioning about an apparent reference in the excerpts to a boat, the agent testified that Delgado's drug-trafficking activity included \"coordinat[ing] possible shipments of narcotics by boat into Puerto Rico\" and \"contract[ing] people . . . to get boats for him and to work for him.\" Finally, the agent identified the person with whom Delgado spoke in the third phone call (# 572) as a co-defendant who worked with Delgado \"in distributing drugs here in Puerto Rico.\" The transcripts of the suppression hearing contain no indication of when or in what context a firearm is mentioned in the call excerpts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the excerpts were played, the DEA agent testified that, during the search of Delgado's apartment, another agent asked Delgado whether he kept a firearm in a safe in his apartment, and Delgado replied that he kept a gun in the car. The agent testified that Delgado then identified the car key to the agents, who subsequently found a semi-automatic pistol in Delgado's rental car, which was parked outside the apartment. No drugs were seized during the search of the apartment or the car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 27, 2003, the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation to deny Delgado's motion to suppress the firearm, finding that Delgado had validly consented to the search of the car. The magistrate judge also noted that, \"[b]ased on information acquired via [court-authorized] intercepts, the agents believed defendant carried a firearm\" (footnote omitted). The district court adopted the report and recommendation on April 21, 2003.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Delgado's initial change-of-plea hearing took place one week later, on April 28, 2003, and the supplemental plea colloquy was held on June 20, 2003.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The transcript of the suppression hearing indicates that the government provided English-language translations of the intercepted phone calls that were played during the hearing to both Delgado and the magistrate judge. After the calls were played, the government provided copies of the translations to the court interpreter for certification.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The magistrate judge's report and recommendation, which was issued the next day, on March 27, 2003, further indicates that \"[t]he English language translations of the [recordings played during the hearing] shall be certified by the court interpreter and be made part of the record.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> However, the record on appeal contains no trace of the translations, certified or uncertified, nor any indication that they were ever made part of the record below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Government's Supplementation of the Record During Direct Appeal</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After oral argument in the instant appeal and upon notification by the district court of the absence of the English-language translations of the intercepted phone calls from the record, the government was unable to locate copies of the translations that had been provided to Delgado, the magistrate judge, and the court interpreter during the suppression hearing. Instead, the government moved before the district court on June 13, 2005 to supplement the record with newly translated transcripts of the intercepted phone calls, which were completed and certified on June 2, 2005, and to have those transcripts \"transmitted expeditiously to the Court of Appeals.\" <i>See</i> Fed. R.App. P. 10(e)(2)(B) (district court may supplement the record \"before or after [it] has been forwarded\" to the court of appeals). The district court granted the motion on June 14, 2005,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> and the translated transcripts have been provided to us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Nature of the Firearm Possession Charge</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first address Delgado's claim that the district court committed plain error by misinforming him of the nature of the firearm possession charge. The statute under which Delgado was charged and convicted of firearm possession, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(A), provides, in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[A]ny person who, during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime . . . for which the person may be prosecuted in a court of the United States, uses or carries a firearm, or who, <i>in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm,</i> shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking crime&#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 5 years. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis added). In order to convict Delgado, the government would have had to prove at trial (1) that he committed the underlying drug-trafficking crime, (2) that he knowingly possessed a firearm, and (3) that he did so in furtherance of the specified drug-trafficking crime. <i>See United States v. Flecha-Maldonado,</i> 373 F.3d 170, 179 (1st Cir.2004) (describing \"basic elements\" of &#167; 924(c)(1) violation for using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug-trafficking crime); <i>see also United States v. Cruz,</i> 352 F.3d 499, 509 (1st Cir.2003) (\"[G]iven the text of the statute, merely determining that [a defendant] was in possession of a [firearm] is not enough to support [a] conviction; we must also consider whether the weapon was possessed `<i>in furtherance of</i> . . . a drug-trafficking crime.'\") (quoting &#167; 924(c)(1)(A)) (ellipsis in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During both the initial plea colloquy on April 28, 2003 and the supplemental colloquy on June 20, 2003, the court correctly described Count Two of the indictment as charging Delgado with possession of a firearm \"in furtherance of\" a drug-trafficking offense. However, when the court explained to Delgado the elements the government would have to prove at trial during the initial colloquy on April 28, 2003, it stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, to be found guilty of this offense if a trial were to be held, the Government would have to prove . . . the count concerning the possession of the firearm <i>in connection with</i> the drug trafficking crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis added.)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Delgado argues that, far from ensuring that he understood the elements of the firearm possession charge against him, the court misstated the requisite nexus between the firearm possession and the drug-trafficking offense, in violation of Rule 11(b)(1)(G) and his right to due process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statutory language prohibiting possession of a firearm \"in furtherance of\" the underlying crime was inserted into &#167; 924(c)(1) by amendment in 1998. Congress thus \"broadened &#167; 924 to sweep in the mere possession\" of firearms, in addition to the use or carrying of firearms, but \"only when. . . possessed `in furtherance of' the underlying crime.\" <i>United States v. Castillo,</i> 406 F.3d 806, 812 (7th Cir.2005). As the House Report on the amendment indicates, the \"in furtherance of\" element of a firearm possession charge imposes a \"slightly higher standard\" of liability than the nexus element corresponding to the different charges of using or carrying a firearm, which need only occur \"during and in relation to\" the underlying crime. H.R.Rep. No. 105-344, at 11 (1997) (\"House Report\"). To establish the \"in furtherance of\" requirement of a firearm possession charge under &#167; 924(c)(1),</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[t]he government must clearly show that a firearm was possessed <i>to advance or promote the commission of</i> the underlying offense. The mere presence of a firearm in an area where a criminal act occurs is not a sufficient basis for imposing this particular mandatory sentence. Rather, the government must illustrate through specific facts, which tie the defendant to the firearm, that the firearm was possessed <i>to advance or promote</i> the criminal activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">House Report at 12 (emphases added); <i>see also United States v. Grace,</i> 367 F.3d 29, 35 (1st Cir.2004) (analyzing \"in furtherance of\" element of &#167; 924(c)(1)); <i>accord Castillo,</i> 406 F.3d at 813-14 (interpretation of \"in furtherance of\" to mean \"furthering, advancing or helping forward\" comports with legislative history and purpose of &#167; 924(c), as well as case law of all circuit courts) (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Delgado argues that \"in furtherance of\" means something distinct from \"in connection with\" when used to describe the relationship between possession of a firearm and the commission of a drug-trafficking crime. We agree that the two phrases have different meanings, and that possession of a firearm \"in furtherance of\" a drug-trafficking crime suggests something more by way of nexus between the possession and the crime than the phrase \"in connection with.\" <i>Compare</i> American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 714 (4th ed.2000) (defining \"furtherance\" as \"[t]he act of furthering, advancing, or helping forward\") <i>with id.</i> at 390 (defining \"connection\" as \"[a]n association or relationship\" or \"[r]eference or relation to something else\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Rule 11(b)(1)(G), however, \"does not require the court to explain the technical intricacies of the charges in the indictment.\" <i>United States v. Cruz-Rivera,</i> 357 F.3d 10, 13 (1st Cir.2004). Ordinarily, a court may ascertain that a defendant is aware of the nature of the charge against him by reading the charge in the indictment to the defendant and obtaining his competent acknowledgment that he understands the charge. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Ramirez-Benitez,</i> 292 F.3d 22, 27 (1st Cir.2002) (finding \"no error, let alone plain error,\" where \"[t]he terms of the indictment alone sufficed to put [the defendant] on notice of the charge to which he was pleading guilty. [The defendant] admitted he understood the charge and the court found him competent to plead.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, we have recently recognized that the meaning of firearm possession \"in furtherance of\" a drug-trafficking crime is fluid. \"One might expect with such a common criminal offense that the legal framework would be well settled, but, as is so often the case with general statutory terms, it is not.\" <i>United States v. Felton,</i> 417 F.3d 97, 104 (1st Cir.2005). We therefore conclude that any error in the district court's use of \"in connection with\" to mean \"in furtherance of,\" if error there was, was far from obvious. <i>Cf. Gandia-Maysonet,</i> 227 F.3d at 5 (court erred in \"affirmatively . . . misstat[ing] the scienter element\" through omission of carjacking statute's requirement of intent to kill or cause bodily harm).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, even if we were to assume, arguendo, that the court plainly erred by understating the nature of the nexus requirement of the firearm possession charge, Delgado has not established that the difference in degree between the two formulations affected his substantial rights. <i>See Negron-Narvaez,</i> 403 F.3d at 37; <i>see also United States v. Hernandez-Albino,</i> 177 F.3d 33, 41 (1st Cir.1999) (assuming, arguendo, that court's failure to include \"in relation to\" in jury instruction for charge of carrying a firearm \"during and in relation to\" a drug-trafficking offense \"was error and that the error was plain,\" defendant failed to show prejudice under plain error review). During the initial colloquy on April 28, 2003, the court asked Delgado whether he had received a copy of the charges against him, as well as whether he had discussed those charges with counsel. Delgado replied unequivocally that he had. Both the indictment and the plea agreement that Delgado signed correctly use the statutory \"in furtherance of\" language to describe the firearm possession charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, \"Rule 11 is disserved\" if a defendant chooses whether to proceed to trial \"based on a misappreciation of the weight &#8212; light or heavy &#8212; of the government's burden as to a charge and its elements.\" <i>United States v. Medina-Roman,</i> 376 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.2004). On one side of the balance, Delgado argues that the government's circumstantial evidence that he possessed a firearm \"in furtherance of\" a drug-trafficking offense was weak.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> On the other side of the balance rest the firearm itself, which was admissible at trial, and Delgado's admission, supported by the government's wiretap and other proffered evidence, that he conspired to smuggle cocaine by speed boat into Puerto Rico for further distribution and sale. Given the weight of the evidence as a whole, Delgado fails to demonstrate a reasonable probability that, although he entered a guilty plea when the charge against him was explained as possession of a firearm \"in connection with\" a drug-trafficking crime, he would have chosen to face trial if the charge had instead been described as possession of a firearm \"in furtherance of\" a drug-trafficking crime. <i>See Dominguez Benitez,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 2336.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B.

Delgado does not dispute that he knowingly possessed a firearm, nor that he committed a drug-trafficking crime by participating in the drug conspiracy to which he pled guilty in Count One. He challenges only the factual basis for the \"in furtherance of\" element of the firearm possession charge, arguing that the government's proffered evidence during the supplemental Rule 11 hearing fails to establish the requisite nexus between his possession of the firearm and his drug-trafficking offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When determining whether a sufficient factual basis exists to support a guilty plea, the question before the court \"is not whether a jury would, or even would be likely, to convict: it is whether there is enough evidence so that the plea has a rational basis in facts that the defendant concedes or that the government proffers as supported by credible evidence.\" <i>Gandia-Maysonet,</i> 227 F.3d at 6. In other words, there must be \"an admission, colloquy, proffer, or some other basis for thinking that the defendant is at least arguably guilty.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the government recognized when it sought a supplemental Rule 11 hearing in its motion of May 2, 2003, no facts supporting the firearm possession charge (apart from those also supporting the underlying drug-trafficking charge) were set forth during the initial plea colloquy on April 28, 2003, and no such facts appeared in the signed statement of facts attached to Delgado's plea agreement. When the court held the supplemental Rule 11 hearing on June 20, 2003, the government stated only, in conclusory fashion, that Delgado had \"discussed the possession of the firearm in connection with [his] drug activities\" during conspiracy-related phone calls, and referred the court to the record of the hearings on Delgado's suppression motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the record of those hearings contains evidence that Delgado possessed a firearm, it does not contain the government's promised evidence demonstrating the requisite nexus between Delgado's firearm possession and the drug conspiracy. While the translated transcripts of the intercepted phone calls that were played in Spanish during the suppression hearing may very well have contained relevant facts, those transcripts are not part of the record of that hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge's tangential observation in his March 27, 2003 report and recommendation on Delgado's suppression motion that, \"[b]ased on information acquired via [court-authorized] intercepts, the [DEA] agents believed defendant carried a firearm\" (footnote omitted), establishes only what Delgado does not dispute: that he possessed a firearm. Although the phone calls were intercepted pursuant to a court order as part of a drug conspiracy investigation, the government played the calls during the suppression hearing only to support the DEA agent's testimony that the agents had reason to believe Delgado had a firearm when they elicited his valid consent to their search of his rental car, not to show that Delgado possessed the firearm for any particular purpose. Indeed, the transcript of the hearing fails to indicate when and in what context the phone calls refer to a firearm. The facts and circumstances of the firearm's seizure from Delgado's rental car, which was parked outside his apartment, in which no drugs or drug activity were detected, also shed no light on the relationship between the firearm and Delgado's drug-trafficking activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of these gaps in the record, the court's judicial notice of the suppression motion proceedings &#8212; taken at the government's urging &#8212; contributes nothing to the factual basis for the \"in furtherance of\" element of the firearm possession charge; there simply were no pertinent facts in the record of which to take notice. Finally, the presentence investigation report, from which the district court could have gleaned a factual basis \"[b]efore entering judgment on [Delgado's] guilty plea,\" Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(3), contains no facts whatsoever relating to the firearm possession charge. Under these circumstances, the court had no way of evaluating the factual basis for Delgado's guilty plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the government's proffered evidence lacked a rational basis in facts for the \"in furtherance of\" element of the firearm possession charge, the district court erred in determining that there was an adequate factual predicate for Delgado's guilty plea. Although discovery of the error required examination of the suppression hearing record, we could readily discern the absence of the facts represented by the government to exist in that record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not enough, however, for a defendant facing plain error review of his claim to establish that an \"error\" occurred and that it was \"plain.\" He must also show that the error \"affected his substantial rights, and that it seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceeding.\" <i>Negron-Narvaez,</i> 403 F.3d at 37.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[I]n assessing the effect of Rule 11 error, a reviewing court must look to the entire record, not to the plea proceedings alone. . . .\" <i>Dominguez-Benitez,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 2338. Based on our review of the entire record, we conclude that despite the deficiencies in the government's proffer of evidence, Delgado was not \"in the position of pleading voluntarily with an understanding of the nature of the charge but without realizing that his conduct [did] not actually fall within the charge.\" <i>Ventura-Cruel,</i> 356 F.3d at 59-60 (internal quotation marks omitted). To the contrary, as we discuss below, the record shows that the government disclosed evidence to Delgado that was sufficient to support the \"in furtherance of\" element. Delgado thus fails to convince us that there is a \"reasonable probability that, but for\" the court's inability to consider that evidence during the plea proceedings, \"he would not have entered the [guilty] plea.\" <i>Dominguez Benitez,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 2336.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record as supplemented after oral argument now contains certified English translations of the intercepted phone calls played during the suppression hearing. In his response to the government's submission of the newly translated transcripts, Delgado does not dispute the accuracy of the government's translations or seek to strike them from the record; rather, he argues that the government's belatedly filed translations only serve to confirm its lack of evidence supporting a factual basis for his guilty plea because the certified translations contain no explicit reference either to a firearm or to Delgado's drug-trafficking activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are aided in our evaluation of the likelihood of a different outcome by one additional document, which we have excavated from the record without the assistance of the parties. That document is the government's \"Informative Motion Regarding Anticipated Evidence\" as to Delgado and his co-defendants, filed on April 9, 2003, after the suppression hearings took place before the magistrate judge on March 9 and 26, 2003 and before the district court adopted the magistrate judge's report and recommendation to deny Delgado's motion to suppress on April 21, 2003.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> In its informative motion, the government stated its intent to prepare and provide to Delgado a single compact disc containing the three recorded phone calls purportedly relating to Delgado's possession of a firearm. The motion then provides brief descriptions of the contents of each phone call. No transcripts, whether in Spanish or English, are attached to the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to Delgado's argument, the contents of the translated transcripts provide a sufficient factual basis for the \"in furtherance of\" element of the firearm possession charge to which Delgado pled guilty. The descriptions in the government's informative motion further confirm the existence of a factual basis for Delgado's guilty plea.

Pursuant to a plea agreement, Delgado stipulated that the drug conspiracy in Count One involved three kilograms of cocaine. Based on that drug quantity, Delgado's leading role in the conspiracy, his acceptance of responsibility, and his Criminal History Category (II), the district court sentenced Delgado on July 28, 2003 to 84 months (7 years) of imprisonment for the conspiracy conviction and a consecutive term of 60 months (5 years) of imprisonment for the firearm possession conviction, for a total of 144 months (12 years) of imprisonment.

While we ultimately conclude that Delgado has not met his burden of establishing plain error with respect to either of his claims, the government's carelessness in making its record in this case hampered not only our ability to review Delgado's claims on appeal, but also the district court's ability to evaluate the factual basis for his guilty plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

After determining that Delgado had received a copy of the charges against him and had \"fully discussed those charges and the case in general with . . . counsel,\" the court described the drug

commit an offense defined in Title 21, U.S.Code, Section 841(a)(1), that is, to possess with the intent to distribute and to distribute more than one kilogram of heroin, a Schedule I controlled

<span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, to be found guilty of this offense if a trial were to be held, the Government would have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that you unlawfully, willfully, knowingly[,] and intentionally combined, conspired, and agreed with the other co-defendants and with others to the grand jury known and unknown to commit the offense that I have previously described as well as the count concerning the possession of the firearm in connection with the drug trafficking crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span

the drug conspiracy charge in Count One.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The government stated that if Delgado had chosen to face trial on that charge, it would have produced evidence in the form of:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the testimony of witnesses and most notably recordings of calls intercepted pursuant to the authorized Title [III] wiretap on [Delgado's] telephones that would have shown that beginning not later than December of 2000, [Delgado] agreed with others to smuggle quantities of cocaine and heroin into Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government further stated that it would introduce evidence that \"on several occasions [Delgado] sought to acquire kilogram quantities of cocaine in Puerto Rico\" and \"negotiated to purchase heroin and cocaine from persons outside the United States in outfitted go-fast boats [speed boats] to smuggle cocaine and heroin into Puerto Rico.\" The government concluded by stating that it would introduce evidence that \"this defendant and his co-conspirators distributed these narcotics for sale to other persons for further sale to consumers in Puerto Rico and New York.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite its recitation of facts in support of the drug conspiracy charge in Count One, the government neglected to present any facts whatsoever in support of the firearm possession charge in Count Two. Similarly, although the government's proffer of evidence in support of the drug conspiracy charge in Count One reflected the contents of the statement of facts that Delgado signed as an attachment to his plea agreement, that statement of facts contains no description of the factual predicate for the firearm possession charge in Count Two. Nevertheless, Delgado pled guilty to both counts in the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 2, 2003, the government acknowledged its error and moved to hold a supplemental Rule 11 hearing \"to ensure that the defendant acknowledges and admits the factual basis for his plea\" of guilty to the firearm possession charge. In its motion, the government indicated that it had already presented the evidence establishing the factual basis for the firearm possession charge during evidentiary hearings before a magistrate judge on Delgado's motion to suppress a firearm seized from his rental car when federal agents executed arrest and search warrants at his apartment on December 10, 2001. According to the government's motion, the evidence providing a factual basis for the firearm possession charge consisted of: (1) the seized firearm and (2) \"intercepted pertinent conspiracy-related telephone conversations in which [Delgado] spoke of his possession of a firearm.\" The government did not attach transcripts or descriptions of the recorded phone calls to its motion. Instead, the government requested that the court \"take notice of its own record of the evidence presented during the [suppression] hearings.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 20, 2003, the court held a supplemental Rule 11 hearing in response to the government's motion of May 2, 2003. During the supplemental hearing, the government again \"invite[d] the Court's attention to its own records from the [suppression hearing] in which [intercepted telephone] calls were introduced in evidence.\" After explaining the purpose for the supplemental hearing to Delgado, the court described the firearm possession charge in Count Two as set forth in the indictment, just as it had during the first Rule 11 hearing on April 28, 2003. The court continued: \"as counsel for the Government has stated, you know, there was a motion to suppress that was filed in this case, and I take judicial notice of the prior record in this case that states more or less the facts underlying that Count Two.\" The court did not further specify which parts of the record it was relying on or which facts supplied a basis for the charge. It did, however, make reference later in the hearing to its \"adopt[ion of] the [m]agistrate[] [judge's] version of the facts as stated in his report and recommendation\" on Delgado's suppression motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government then stated that if the case had proceeded to trial, it would have introduced the evidence it had already presented during the suppression hearing, namely, the \"pistol [seized] from [Delgado's rental] car outside of his apartment\" and transcripts of intercepted phone calls \"in which in coded language [Delgado] in two of these calls, discussed the possession of the firearm in connection with the drug activities.\" The government did not elaborate further on the nature or contents of the phone calls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Delgado's counsel added only that \"when the firearm was seized from that automobile, Mr. Delgado Hernandez was in his apartment and not in the automobile. That's, I think, factually correct.\" The court then asked Delgado if he \"agree[d] with the Government's version that you just heard with respect to Count Two.\" After consulting with counsel, Delgado replied, \"Yes, your Honor.\" Delgado then pled guilty a second time to the firearm possession charge in Count Two.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The presentence investigation report that was sent to Delgado and to the government on June 23, 2003, just after the supplemental Rule 11 hearing and prior to Delgado's sentencing on July 28, 2003, does not mention any facts in support of the firearm possession charge in Count Two.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Suppression Hearings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The suppression hearings that the government and the district court referred to during the supplemental Rule 11 proceeding, and that the court took judicial notice of, took place before the magistrate judge on March 9, 2003 and March 26, 2003. During the suppression proceedings, Delgado argued that the firearm seized from his rental car was inadmissible in the government's case-in-chief at trial because he had not validly consented to the search of the car after agents arrested him and during the search of his apartment pursuant to a warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the hearing on March 26, 2003, a Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") agent testified that, based on cell phone conversations intercepted during the drug conspiracy investigation pursuant to a court order, the agents had reason to believe Delgado possessed a firearm when they executed the search and arrest warrants. In support of this testimony, the government played during the hearing four excerpts from recordings of three intercepted phone conversations between Delgado and others, all of which were conducted in Spanish. The government referred to the excerpts as recordings # 316, # 70, # 71, and # 572.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on his knowledge of the investigation, the DEA agent testified that Delgado was the person referred to in the calls as \"Frank.\" The agent identified the person Delgado spoke to in one of the calls (# 316) as the mother of Delgado's former wife, but did not ascribe any drug-related activity to her. The agent was not asked to identify any of the speakers in the second set of call excerpts (# 70 and # 71). However, in response to questioning about an apparent reference in the excerpts to a boat, the agent testified that Delgado's drug-trafficking activity included \"coordinat[ing] possible shipments of narcotics by boat into Puerto Rico\" and \"contract[ing] people . . . to get boats for him and to work for him.\" Finally, the agent identified the person with whom Delgado spoke in the third phone call (# 572) as a co-defendant who worked with Delgado \"in distributing drugs here in Puerto Rico.\" The transcripts of the suppression hearing contain no indication of when or in what context a firearm is mentioned in the call excerpts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the excerpts were played, the DEA agent testified that, during the search of Delgado's apartment, another agent asked Delgado whether he kept a firearm in a safe in his apartment, and Delgado replied that he kept a gun in the car. The agent testified that Delgado then identified the car key to the agents, who subsequently found a semi-automatic pistol in Delgado's rental car, which was parked outside the apartment. No drugs were seized during the search of the apartment or the car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 27, 2003, the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation to deny Delgado's motion to suppress the firearm, finding that Delgado had validly consented to the search of the car. The magistrate judge also noted that, \"[b]ased on information acquired via [court-authorized] intercepts, the agents believed defendant carried a firearm\" (footnote omitted). The district court adopted the report and recommendation on April 21, 2003.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Delgado's initial change-of-plea hearing took place one week later, on April 28, 2003, and the supplemental plea colloquy was held on June 20, 2003.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The transcript of the suppression hearing indicates that the government provided English-language translations of the intercepted phone calls that were played during the hearing to both Delgado and the magistrate judge.

Instead, the government moved before the district court on June 13, 2005 to supplement the record with newly translated transcripts of the intercepted phone calls, which were completed and certified on June 2, 2005, and to have those transcripts \"transmitted expeditiously to the Court of Appeals.\" <i>See</i> Fed.

The statute under which Delgado was charged and convicted of firearm possession, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(A), provides, in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[A]ny person who, during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime . . . for which the person may be prosecuted in a court of the United States, uses or carries a firearm, or who, <i>in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm,</i> shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking crime&#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 5 years. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis added). In order to convict Delgado, the government would have had to prove at trial (1) that he committed the underlying drug-trafficking crime, (2) that he knowingly possessed a firearm, and (3) that he did so in furtherance of the specified drug-trafficking crime. <i>See United States v.

However, when the court explained to Delgado the elements the government would have to prove at trial during the initial colloquy on April 28, 2003, it stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, to be found guilty of this offense if a trial were to be held, the Government would have to prove . . . the count concerning the possession of the firearm <i>in connection with</i> the drug trafficking crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis added.)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Delgado argues that, far from ensuring that he understood the elements of the firearm possession charge against him, the court misstated the requisite nexus between the firearm possession and the drug-trafficking offense, in violation of Rule 11(b)(1)(G) and his right to due process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statutory language prohibiting possession of a firearm \"in furtherance of\" the underlying crime was inserted into &#167; 924(c)(1) by amendment in 1998.

As the House Report on the amendment indicates, the \"in furtherance of\" element of a firearm possession charge imposes a \"slightly higher standard\" of liability than the nexus element corresponding to the different charges of using or carrying a firearm, which need only occur \"during and in relation to\" the underlying crime. H.R.Rep. No. 105-344, at 11 (1997) (\"House Report\").

Ordinarily, a court may ascertain that a defendant is aware of the nature of the charge against him by reading the charge in the indictment to the defendant and obtaining his competent acknowledgment that he understands the charge. <i>See, e.g., United States v.

We therefore conclude that any error in the district court's use of \"in connection with\" to mean \"in furtherance of,\" if error there was, was far from obvious. <i>Cf. Gandia-Maysonet,</i> 227 F.3d at 5 (court erred in \"affirmatively . . . misstat[ing] the scienter element\" through omission of carjacking statute's requirement of intent to kill or cause bodily harm).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, even if we were to assume, arguendo, that the court plainly erred by understating the nature of the nexus requirement of the firearm possession charge, Delgado has not established that the difference in degree between the two formulations affected his substantial rights. <i>See Negron-Narvaez,</i> 403 F.3d at 37; <i>see also United States v.

During the initial colloquy on April 28, 2003, the court asked Delgado whether he had received a copy of the charges against him, as well as whether he had discussed those charges with counsel.

On one side of the balance, Delgado argues that the government's circumstantial evidence that he possessed a firearm \"in furtherance of\" a drug-trafficking offense was weak.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> On the other side of the balance rest the firearm itself, which was admissible at trial, and Delgado's admission, supported by the government's wiretap and other proffered evidence, that he conspired to smuggle cocaine by speed boat into Puerto Rico for further distribution and sale. Given the weight of the evidence as a whole, Delgado fails to demonstrate a reasonable probability that, although he entered a guilty plea when the charge against him was explained as possession of a firearm \"in connection with\" a drug-trafficking crime, he would have chosen to face trial if the charge had instead been described as possession of a firearm \"in furtherance of\" a drug-trafficking crime. <i>See Dominguez Benitez,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 2336.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B.

Delgado does not dispute that he knowingly possessed a firearm, nor that he committed a drug-trafficking crime by participating in the drug conspiracy to which he pled guilty in Count One. He challenges only the factual basis for the \"in furtherance of\" element of the firearm possession charge, arguing that the government's proffered evidence during the supplemental Rule 11 hearing fails to establish the requisite nexus between his possession of the firearm and his drug-trafficking offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When determining whether a sufficient factual basis exists to support a guilty plea, the question before the court \"is not whether a jury would, or even would be likely, to convict: it is whether there is enough evidence so that the plea has a rational basis in facts that the defendant concedes or that the government proffers as supported by credible evidence.\" <i>Gandia-Maysonet,</i> 227 F.3d at 6. In other words, there must be \"an admission, colloquy, proffer, or some other basis for thinking that the defendant is at least arguably guilty.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the government recognized when it sought a supplemental Rule 11 hearing in its motion of May 2, 2003, no facts supporting the firearm possession charge (apart from those also supporting the underlying drug-trafficking charge) were set forth during the initial plea colloquy on April 28, 2003, and no such facts appeared in the signed statement of facts attached to Delgado's plea agreement. When the court held the supplemental Rule 11 hearing on June 20, 2003, the government stated only, in conclusory fashion, that Delgado had \"discussed the possession of the firearm in connection with [his] drug activities\" during conspiracy-related phone calls, and referred the court to the record of the hearings on Delgado's suppression motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the record of those hearings contains evidence that Delgado possessed a firearm, it does not contain the government's promised evidence demonstrating the requisite nexus between Delgado's firearm possession and the drug conspiracy. While the translated transcripts of the intercepted phone calls that were played in Spanish during the suppression hearing may very well have contained relevant facts, those transcripts are not part of the record of that hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge's tangential observation in his March 27, 2003 report and recommendation on Delgado's suppression motion that, \"[b]ased on information acquired via [court-authorized] intercepts, the [DEA] agents believed defendant carried a firearm\" (footnote omitted), establishes only what Delgado does not dispute: that he possessed a firearm. Although the phone calls were intercepted pursuant to a court order as part of a drug conspiracy investigation, the government played the calls during the suppression hearing only to support the DEA agent's testimony that the agents had reason to believe Delgado had a firearm when they elicited his valid consent to their search of his rental car, not to show that Delgado possessed the firearm for any particular purpose. Indeed, the transcript of the hearing fails to indicate when and in what context the phone calls refer to a firearm. The facts and circumstances of the firearm's seizure from Delgado's rental car, which was parked outside his apartment, in which no drugs or drug activity were detected, also shed no light on the relationship between the firearm and Delgado's drug-trafficking activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of these gaps in the record, the court's judicial notice of the suppression motion proceedings &#8212; taken at the government's urging &#8212; contributes nothing to the factual basis for the \"in furtherance of\" element of the firearm possession charge; there simply were no pertinent facts in the record of which to take notice. Finally, the presentence investigation report, from which the district court could have gleaned a factual basis \"[b]efore entering judgment on [Delgado's] guilty plea,\" Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(3), contains no facts whatsoever relating to the firearm possession charge. Under these circumstances, the court had no way of evaluating the factual basis for Delgado's guilty plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the government's proffered evidence lacked a rational basis in facts for the \"in furtherance of\" element of the firearm possession charge, the district court erred in determining that there was an adequate factual predicate for Delgado's guilty plea. Although discovery of the error required examination of the suppression hearing record, we could readily discern the absence of the facts represented by the government to exist in that record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not enough, however, for a defendant facing plain error review of his claim to establish that an \"error\" occurred and that it was \"plain.\" He must also show that the error \"affected his substantial rights, and that it seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceeding.\" <i>Negron-Narvaez,</i> 403 F.3d at 37.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[I]n assessing the effect of Rule 11 error, a reviewing court must look to the entire record, not to the plea proceedings alone. . . .\" <i>Dominguez-Benitez,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 2338.

In his response to the government's submission of the newly translated transcripts, Delgado does not dispute the accuracy of the government's translations or seek to strike them from the record; rather, he argues that the government's belatedly filed translations only serve to confirm its lack of evidence supporting a factual basis for his guilty plea because the certified translations contain no explicit reference either to a firearm or to Delgado's drug-trafficking activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are aided in our evaluation of the likelihood of a different outcome by one additional document, which we have excavated from the record without the assistance of the parties. That document is the government's \"Informative Motion Regarding Anticipated Evidence\" as to Delgado and his co-defendants, filed on April 9, 2003, after the suppression hearings took place before the magistrate judge on March 9 and 26, 2003 and before the district court adopted the magistrate judge's report and recommendation to deny Delgado's motion to suppress on April 21, 2003.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> In its informative motion, the government stated its intent to prepare and provide to Delgado a single compact disc containing the three recorded phone calls purportedly relating to Delgado's possession of a firearm. The motion then provides brief descriptions of the contents of each phone call. No transcripts, whether in Spanish or English, are attached to the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to Delgado's argument, the contents of the translated transcripts provide a sufficient factual basis for the \"in furtherance of\" element of the firearm possession charge to which Delgado pled guilty. The descriptions in the government's informative motion further confirm the existence of a factual basis for Delgado's guilty plea.

Delgado also notes that although he refers to \"problems\" in call excerpt # 316, the DEA agent testified during the suppression hearing that he was not personally aware of any \"problems\" that Delgado had in his drug-trafficking activities.

The excerpts also contain references to people who could reasonably be inferred to be co-conspirators in a plan to use boats to smuggle drugs; the references in the translations to people who variously \"talk too much,\" \"compromis[e] me,\" and are \"going to get it,\" further suggest that Delgado possessed the firearm either to protect himself when \"people let [him] down\" or to make threats of force to eliminate potential obstacles to the success of the conspiracy. These inferences are reinforced by the government's descriptions in the informative motion, the accuracy of which Delgado has also never challenged, which contain explicit references to a \"gun\" and Delgado's \"tools,\" again in contexts supporting the inference that Delgado possessed a firearm to promote the drug conspiracy in which he participated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the record as a whole contains a \"rational basis in facts\" to support Delgado's guilty plea, <i>Gandia-Maysonet,</i> 227 F.3d at 6, Delgado fails to establish prejudice resulting from the court's inability to evaluate the factual basis proffered by the government during the proceedings below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Delgado has not met his burden under plain error review on either of his claims of error in the plea proceedings below, we <i>affirm</i> Delgado's conviction for possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Delgado's appeal was consolidated with that of a co-defendant for purposes of oral argument.
