Little on brief for appellees.\n\n\n                          June 16, 2006\n\n\n\n     *\n          Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f           LYNCH, Circuit Judge.           A parent, Marta Díaz-Fonseca,\n\nbrought suit in 2002 against the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, its\n\nDepartment of Education, and two individual defendants, alleging\n\nthat her child, Lyssette Cardona-Díaz, had been deprived of a free\n\nand appropriate public education (\"FAPE\") under the Individuals\n\nwith Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 20 U.S.C. § 1400 et seq.;\n\nsection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794; Title II of\n\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-\n\n12134; and Puerto Rico law.\n\n           The   underlying    dispute     concerns     whether    the   public\n\nschools are required to provide Lyssette, a child whom the parties\n\nagree is disabled within the meaning of the IDEA, with adaptive\n\nphysical   education    in    the   form    of   swim    classes      under   an\n\nIndividualized Education Program (IEP), see 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d).\n\nThe dispute led to a jury verdict and an award of compensatory\n\ndamages in the amount of $45,000 to Díaz and $3000 to Lyssette\n\nagainst all of the defendants.        The jury also assessed a total of\n\n$100,000 in punitive damages against the two individual defendants,\n\nCésar   Rey-Hernández   and   Nitza   Ríos-Malavé,       in   their    personal\n\ncapacities. Those two individuals respectively hold the offices of\n\nSecretary of Education of the Commonwealth and Supervisor of the\n\nSpecial Education Program of Cidra School District.               The district\n\ncourt also entered broad declaratory and injunctive relief in favor\n\nof plaintiffs.\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f             We vacate most of the relief granted, leaving intact only\n\nthe award of reimbursement for the sum of private school tuition\n\nand costs for transportation and psychological services incurred by\n\nplaintiffs during the 2003-2004, 2004-2005, and 2005-2006 school\n\nyears.\n\n             This case demonstrates significant confusion about the\n\ngoverning law in cases alleging denial of FAPE, including confusion\n\nover the limitations on monetary relief available, the limitations\n\non   suits    against   school   administrators   in   their   personal\n\ncapacities, and the scope of immunity available to the Commonwealth\n\nin federal court.       Unfortunately, as a result of counsel for\n\nplaintiffs' lack of candor about the law to the district court and\n\ndefense counsel's failures to comply with court orders and to make\n\nappropriate objections on defendants' behalf, the case comes to us\n\nin a posture in which a jury has awarded damages not available in\n\nIDEA and Rehabilitation Act actions.\n\n             In order to clarify, we outline the core holdings of this\n\ncase:\n\n1.   Where the essence of the claim is one stated under the IDEA for\n\ndenial of FAPE, no greater remedies than those authorized under the\n\nIDEA are made available by recasting the claim as one brought under\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1983, Title II of the ADA, or section 504 of the\n\nRehabilitation Act.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\f2.   No punitive damages may be awarded in such a suit, regardless\n\nof which of the causes of action listed above is invoked.\n\n3.   No general compensatory damages may be awarded in such a suit,\n\nregardless of which of the causes of action listed above is\n\ninvoked.\n\n4. Monetary recovery in such suits is limited to compensatory\n\neducation and equitable remedies that involve the payment of money,\n\nsuch as reimbursements for educational expenses that would have\n\nbeen borne by defendants in the first instance had they properly\n\ndeveloped     and   implemented   an    IEP.   Under   the   category   of\n\n\"reimbursement,\" parents may recover only actual, not anticipated,\n\nexpenditures for private tuition and related services.\n\n5.   No claim for monetary relief is stated in such cases against\n\nindividual school administrators who are sued in their personal\n\ncapacities.\n\n6.    A state, here the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, may waive\n\nEleventh Amendment immunity from monetary liability as to IDEA and\n\nRehabilitation Act claims in federal court by accepting federal\n\nfunds.   This does not mean that the state has waived its immunity\n\nas to pendent state law claims being heard in federal court.        Here,\n\nalthough the Commonwealth waived its immunity from suit in federal\n\ncourt on the federal claims, it did not waive its immunity from\n\nsuit in federal court on the pendent state law claims under Law 51,\n\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fsee P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 18, §§ 1351-1359, and Puerto Rico's general\n\nnegligence statute, see P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, §§ 5141-5142.\n\n               Applying these principles, we conclude that the harm to\n\nthe    public       interest    requires      that       we   reverse   and    vacate   the\n\nentirety of the punitive damages award and all compensatory damages\n\nagainst Rey and Ríos in their personal capacities.                         We also vacate\n\nthose portions of the compensatory damages award against the\n\nCommonwealth that are not available as monetary relief.\n\n               Frustrated with the defendants' many defalcations in this\n\ncase, the district court also granted in full plaintiffs' belated\n\nrequest for injunctive and declaratory relief.                            We reverse and\n\nvacate the entirety of the declaratory and injunctive relief\n\nawarded.\n\n                                              I.\n\n               There    is     no    reason      to    detail     the   many   facts    and\n\nprocedural events in this case and every reason to avoid a focus on\n\nthe irrelevant.         The crux of the dispute is that while the parties\n\nagreed       that    Lyssette       could    not      engage     in   ordinary    physical\n\neducation and thus needed adaptive physical education, they could\n\nnot    agree    over    what    type    of    adaptive         physical    education    was\n\nappropriate. The public schools lacked swimming pools and declined\n\nto pay for swim lessons.              Díaz insisted that her daughter needed\n\nsuch lessons and that the schools should have to pay for them, as\n\nwell    as    for     transportation        to     and    from    school    and   for   the\n\n\n                                              -6-\n\fpsychiatric treatment Lyssette required after she became depressed\n\nbecause   she    could     not   engage    in   physical    education   with   her\n\nclassmates. Feeling frustrated that Lyssette was not receiving any\n\nadaptive physical education and that the defendants had engaged in\n\na   classic     bureaucratic      runaround,     Díaz   unilaterally      removed\n\nLyssette from public school in 2003 and placed her in a private\n\nschool.\n\n              At the time the litigation began in September 2002,\n\nLyssette was an eleven-year-old public school student.                   She had\n\nbeen diagnosed in February 2001 with spina bifida and Klippel-Feil\n\nSyndrome, as a result of which she suffers from certain physical\n\nlimitations, such as a circumscribed range of motion in the neck\n\nand cervical spine.        In August 2001, after a physician recommended\n\nthat Lyssette refrain from further participation in traditional\n\nphysical education classes, Díaz registered Lyssette in the special\n\neducation program administered by the DOE1 and requested that\n\nLyssette be provided with specially designed physical education\n\nservices.       See   34    C.F.R.   §     300.307(a)      (\"Physical   education\n\nservices, specially designed if necessary, must be made available\n\nto every child with a disability receiving FAPE.\").\n\n\n\n\n      1\n          In Puerto Rico, it is the Commonwealth's DOE that is\nresponsible for the education of students. See P.R. Laws Ann. tit.\n3, § 143a et seq.; see also P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 18, § 1356(b)(2)(B)\n(stating that the DOE is to \"[p]rovide the education services in\nthe public system adapted to persons with disabilities\").\n\n                                          -7-\n\f            On September 4, 2001, the DOE convened a meeting with\n\nDíaz and other members of Lyssette's IEP team, see id. § 300.16\n\n(defining \"IEP team\" as \"a group of individuals . . . that is\n\nresponsible for developing, reviewing, or revising an IEP for a\n\nchild with a disability\"); see also id. § 300.344 (specifying the\n\ncomposition of IEP teams), to produce an IEP for Lyssette.                   Their\n\ndeliberations resulted in an IEP for the 2001-2002 school year;\n\nthis IEP did not provide for special physical education services --\n\nspecifically, swim classes, which, plaintiffs have maintained, was\n\nthe only sport Lyssette could safely practice.2            The DOE told Díaz\n\nthat it could not provide swim instruction because it did not have\n\nany schools equipped with a pool, and that Díaz would have to pay\n\nout-of-pocket for private swim lessons elsewhere.\n\n            Díaz   filed      an   administrative     complaint       with    the\n\nCommonwealth's DOE on November 27, 2001, requesting that it provide\n\nLyssette with publicly funded swim classes.           An administrative law\n\njudge    (ALJ)   eventually    found   that   the   DOE   did   not   have    the\n\nobligation to offer Lyssette swim lessons, because it was not clear\n\nfrom the IEP that swimming was the most appropriate physical\n\neducation alternative for Lyssette.           The ALJ did, however, order\n\nthat Lyssette receive physical education at the same frequency as\n\n\n\n     2\n          One of Lyssette's doctors had prescribed \"[a]dapted\nphysical education swimming type,\" and had ordered that Lyssette\nrefrain from participating in contact sports or \"any activity that\ncould cause trauma to the neck.\"\n\n                                       -8-\n\fher non-disabled classmates, and further directed the parties to\n\nmeet again to determine, with the help of a specialist, whether\n\nswimming was the most appropriate physical education alternative\n\nfor Lyssette.       That order was not handed down until June 14, 2002,\n\nfar beyond the forty-five days provided by the regulations for\n\nresolution     of    an   administrative   complaint.    See   34   C.F.R.\n\n§ 300.511(a)(1) (\"The public agency shall ensure that not later\n\nthan 45 days after the receipt of a request for a hearing . . . [a]\n\nfinal decision is reached in the hearing . . . .\").\n\n           Several unsuccessful attempts to convene an IEP meeting\n\nfollowed; each meeting was cancelled by someone from the school or\n\nthe DOE.     In the end, Lyssette did not receive a revised IEP for\n\nher sixth-grade year, which was the 2002-2003 school year; rather,\n\nwith Díaz's permission, Lyssette spent time with her Spanish\n\nteacher while her classmates were in physical education class.\n\n           In May 2003, the IEP team convened to create a revised\n\nIEP for the 2003-2004 school year.         At that meeting, co-defendant\n\nRíos told Díaz that she had been instructed to inform Díaz that\n\nthey were not going to develop a new IEP for Lyssette.               Díaz\n\ntestified that Ríos refused to take minutes of the meeting and that\n\nRíos and the other school personnel present abruptly ended the\n\nmeeting when Díaz attempted to record the proceedings.         No revised\n\nIEP was produced and agreed upon by the IEP team for the 2003-2004\n\nschool year.\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\f             Lyssette graduated from sixth grade in June 2003, which\n\nmeant that she had to transfer to a middle school.                 In July of that\n\nyear, Díaz met with DOE and school officials to discuss Lyssette's\n\nplacement options for the following year.                 Díaz requested that her\n\ndaughter be enrolled in the Dejas School, because of that school's\n\nproximity to Lyssette's grandmother's house and the Puerto Rican\n\nMedical     Center,    where      Lyssette's      neurosurgeon    and     orthopedic\n\nsurgeon practiced. The DOE, however, notified Díaz that the school\n\nof   her   choice     was   not    available;      that    the   normal    placement\n\nprocedures for regular-education students applied to Lyssette; and\n\nthat under those procedures, Lyssette could not enroll in the Dejas\n\nSchool,     but   instead     must    choose   from    two    schools     closer   in\n\nproximity to her home.            The topic of physical education was not\n\nraised during this meeting and was not mentioned as a criterion for\n\nDíaz's choice of schools.\n\n             Díaz then informed the DOE that its proffered options\n\nwere not acceptable and that she would be withdrawing Lyssette from\n\npublic     school   and     placing    her   in    private    school    during     the\n\n2003-2004 school year at public cost.                  Lyssette was eventually\n\nenrolled in a private school close to her grandmother's home; that\n\nschool was equipped with a swimming pool, but, according to Díaz,\n\nLyssette did not take swim lessons there because physical education\n\nwas not a part of the regular curriculum and extracurricular\n\nlessons were prohibitively expensive.\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\f          The DOE initiated a second administrative proceeding in\n\nJuly 2003, challenging Lyssette's placement in the private school.\n\nThat proceeding was resolved in the DOE's favor on December 10,\n\n2003, which was apparently also in excess of the forty-five-day\n\ndeadline imposed by the regulations.\n\n          In the interim, Díaz filed this suit on September 4, 2002\n\nin federal court on behalf of herself and her daughter, alleging\n\nthat Lyssette's \"IEP was administered inadequately, untimely[,] and\n\ncontrary to law,\" and that Díaz was deprived of her rights to\n\nparental involvement and to a timely, fair, and impartial due\n\nprocess hearing.   Plaintiffs named as defendants the Commonwealth\n\nand the DOE (\"the Commonwealth defendants\"), as well as Rey and\n\nRíos (\"the individual defendants\"), who were sued both in their\n\npersonal capacities and in their official capacities as Secretary\n\nof Education of the Commonwealth and Supervisor of the Special\n\nEducation Program of the Cidra School District, respectively.3       In\n\ntheir initial complaint, plaintiffs asserted against all defendants\n\nclaims under the IDEA, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, Title\n\nII of the ADA, and Puerto Rico law.\n\n          Defendants   answered    with   a   number   of   affirmative\n\ndefenses, including that \"[f]ederal policy precludes money damages\n\n\n\n     3\n          Ríos was not named in the original complaint; plaintiffs\nwere granted leave to amend their complaint to add her as a\ndefendant, in her personal and official capacities, on February 6,\n2004.\n\n                                  -11-\n\ffor   IDEA    claims\"     and   that        \"[t]he   Eleventh      Amendment    bars\n\n[plaintiffs'] claims.\"          They also filed a motion to dismiss,\n\narguing that the Commonwealth defendants had Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity against the federal law claims, that the federal statutes\n\ndid not provide for individual liability, and that the district\n\ncourt should decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the\n\nstate law claims.        The district court partially granted the motion\n\non December 16, 2003, dismissing the ADA claim for money damages\n\nagainst all defendants and the Rehabilitation Act claim against Rey\n\n(then the only individual defendant) in his personal capacity.\n\nPlaintiffs did not appeal these rulings.\n\n             Plaintiffs subsequently amended their complaint.                   They\n\ndropped their ADA claim, kept their claims under the IDEA and\n\nPuerto     Rico    law   against      all    defendants,     and     reasserted    a\n\nRehabilitation Act claim against the Commonwealth defendants only.\n\nThey sought declaratory relief under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202;\n\neconomic     and   non-economic       damages;       compensatory     and    special\n\ndamages, including damages for \"pain and suffering, emotional\n\ndistress,    humiliation,       and    the    cost    of   appropriate      remedial\n\nservices,     including     educational        services\";    punitive       damages;\n\nlitigation costs and fees; and \"other and further relief at law or\n\nin equity\" as the court deemed proper.\n\n             As the suit progressed, defendants took a lackadaisical\n\napproach to responding to their discovery obligations and various\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\fcourt orders.       In particular, the DOE repeatedly failed to comply\n\nwith the court's orders to produce the full record from the prior\n\nadministrative       proceedings.        Plaintiffs   moved   to   sanction\n\ndefendants.     In due course, the court did sanction defendants by\n\nstriking their pleadings and entering a default order against them,\n\nand it did not relent when defendants sought to remove the default.\n\n            It is important to be clear about the nature of the\n\ndefault order.       The court said that \"[t]his case is going to be\n\ntried on default, but it is not the typical default.\"               Indeed,\n\nunlike other defaults, the court's default order did not result in\n\nentry of a liability judgment with only damages to be determined.\n\nRather, the court allowed the case to go to the jury on liability\n\nand damages, and permitted plaintiffs to present evidence of both.4\n\nFurthermore, the court precluded defendants from introducing any\n\nevidence,     but    did   give   them   some   leeway   to   cross-examine\n\nplaintiffs' witnesses and did allow them to make opening and\n\nclosing statements.\n\n            The case was tried to a jury over the course of three\n\ndays beginning October 28, 2004.5 Testifying on plaintiffs' behalf\n\nwere Díaz and Lyssette, as well as Marlene Aponte Cabrera, a former\n\n\n\n     4\n          The parties' briefs consistently mischaracterize the jury\ntrial as being limited to the issue of damages.                That\ncharacterization is belied by the record.\n     5\n            Defendants retained new counsel the day before jury\nselection.\n\n                                    -13-\n\fDOE ALJ, and María del Carmen Warren-González, the head of a\n\ncommittee of parents involved in an unrelated class-action suit\n\nagainst the DOE.   Defendants made opening and closing statements\n\nand cross-examined plaintiffs' witnesses.\n\n          At the close of plaintiffs' case, defendants moved for\n\njudgment as a matter of law, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a).\n\nThey made a number of arguments, including that the default was\n\nincorrectly entered against them, that there was insufficient\n\nevidence that the IEP was inadequate, and that the individual\n\ndefendants were entitled to qualified immunity.     The motion was\n\ndenied.\n\n          At defendants' request, before closing statements, the\n\ncourt talked to the jury about the default order.   It explained to\n\nthe jury that it had entered a \"default\" against defendants as a\n\nsanction against them for failing to produce evidence as ordered,\n\nwhich meant that defendants were \"preclu[ded] from presenting any\n\nevidence in the case.\" This sanction, the court said, had \"nothing\n\nto do with the merits of the case\" and should not be taken against\n\ndefendants; rather, the case should be decided \"solely upon the\n\nevidence received here in Court and upon the instructions that I\n\ngive you, not upon the default that was previously entered.\"\n\n          After closing statements, defendants did not object that\n\nas a matter of law punitive damages were not available under the\n\nIDEA and the Rehabilitation Act, that compensatory relief did not\n\n\n                              -14-\n\finclude many of the categories of damages plaintiffs sought, and\n\nthat no federal cause of action was available in a personal\n\ncapacity against the individual defendants.    The court relied on\n\nplaintiffs' representations to the contrary and instructed the jury\n\nthat punitive and compensatory damages were available against all\n\ndefendants.   The court explained to the jury that compensatory\n\ndamages \"are damages designed . . . to put [a person] in the\n\nposition [he] would have been [in] had no harm . . . taken place,\"\n\nand it gave the example of damages for repairs, lost wages, and\n\nmedical expenses that would be available in a suit based on\n\ninjuries from a car accident.     It then contrasted compensatory\n\ndamages with punitive damages, which \"are designed to . . . punish\n\nan actor when [he has] acted with deliberate indifference toward[]\n\nthe rights of another.\"   The court also instructed the jury on the\n\nelements of causes of action under the IDEA, the Rehabilitation\n\nAct, § 1983, Title II of the ADA, and the Commonwealth law of\n\nnegligence.\n\n          Defendants objected to these instructions only on three\n\ngrounds:6 (1) that an instruction regarding expert testimony was\n\nimproper; (2) that compensatory damages were not available under\n\n\n\n     6\n          At this time, defendants also raised an objection, not\nargued in their previous Rule 50(a) motion, that the Rehabilitation\nAct claim should be dismissed because \"the accommodation under that\nlaw has nothing to do with the accommodation that is claimed under\n[the] IDEA,\" and thus the only legal claim available was one under\nthe IDEA.\n\n                                -15-\n\fthe state law claim, because Puerto Rico's Law 51, P.R. Laws Ann.\n\ntit. 18, §§ 1351-1359, did not explicitly allow for damages; and\n\n(3) that because the amended complaint requested damages \"in an\n\namount to be proved at trial,\" and this was a default trial, the\n\nonly       damages   available   were   the    $44,000   of   economic   damages\n\ntestified to by Díaz.        Defendants also made one objection to the\n\nverdict form: that it was unclear from the form and the court's\n\ninstructions that the jury need not award punitive damages against\n\nboth of the individual defendants. The court rejected all of these\n\narguments.\n\n               The jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiffs.           It\n\nassessed compensatory damages against all of the defendants in the\n\namount of $45,000 to Díaz and $3000 to Lyssette.                 The jury also\n\nassessed a $100,000 punitive damages award in favor of Lyssette,\n\nwhich was understood to be against the individual defendants in\n\ntheir personal capacities.7\n\n               Judgment was entered on November 9, 2004.           On November\n\n24, defendants filed a timely motion renewing their request for\n\njudgment as a matter of law, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b), and\n\nrequesting, in the alternative, a new trial or remittitur, see Fed.\n\n\n       7\n          The jury verdict form did not specify whether the\ncompensatory and punitive damages were assessed against the\nindividual defendants in their personal or official capacities;\nhowever, the amended complaint specified that the individuals were\n\"sued in their official capacities for purposes of declaratory,\ninjunctive and ancillary relief and in their personal capacities\nfor purposes of monetary relief.\"\n\n                                        -16-\n\fR. Civ. P. 59.         In support of their motion, defendants raised a\n\npanoply of arguments, some of which had not been articulated after\n\ntheir initial pleadings were struck by the district court and\n\nbefore    the    jury    verdict.        In    addition    to    challenging       the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury verdict, defendants\n\nargued that as a matter of law, none of the statutes pleaded by\n\nplaintiffs      provided      for   punitive   damages    or    for   the   type    of\n\ncompensatory relief plaintiffs sought and were awarded. Defendants\n\nalso argued that these statutes did not allow the individual\n\ndefendants to be sued in their personal capacities, and reiterated\n\ntheir argument, presented in their Rule 50(a) motion, that Rey and\n\nRíos were protected by qualified immunity.                     The district court\n\ndenied defendants' motion, without explanation of reasons, on\n\nJanuary 3, 2005.\n\n            Meanwhile, on November 23, 2004, plaintiffs filed a\n\nmotion for declaratory relief, which defendants duly opposed.                      The\n\ncourt summarily granted plaintiffs' motion in its entirety on\n\nJanuary   3,    2005    and    summarily      rejected    on    February    7,   2005\n\ndefendants' subsequent motion to amend the declaratory judgment\n\norder.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\f                                      II.\n\n                       Challenge to Entry of Default\n\n           Defendants argue the district court abused its discretion\n\nwhen it refused to set aside the default order against them.8                On\n\nplaintiffs' motion, the court had entered default against the DOE,\n\npursuant   to   Rule    37(b)(2)(C)    of    the   Federal   Rules   of   Civil\n\nProcedure, because it repeatedly failed to produce a full and\n\naccurate copy of the administrative record, as required by the\n\nIDEA, see 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)(C)(i) (providing that \"[i]n any\n\n[civil] action brought under this paragraph, the court . . . shall\n\nreceive the records of the administrative proceedings\"), and by the\n\ncourt's discovery orders.      See Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2)(C) (\"If a\n\nparty . . . fails to obey an order to provide or permit discovery,\n\n. . . the court . . . may make . . . [a]n order striking out\n\npleadings . . . or rendering a judgment by default against the\n\ndisobedient party[.]\").      In the same order, the court also entered\n\ndefault against the individual defendants on the ground that they\n\nfailed to comply with discovery rules and other discovery orders.\n\n           On appeal, the Commonwealth defendants argue that their\n\nfailure to provide the administrative record is not a proper ground\n\n\n\n     8\n          Plaintiffs argue that the default order is not properly\nbefore this court on appeal because defendants failed to specify in\ntheir notice of appeal that they were contesting the default order.\nSee Fed. R. App. P. 3(c)(1)(B) (requiring the notice of appeal to\n\"designate the judgment, order, or part thereof being appealed\").\nBecause we uphold the default order, we need not reach this issue.\n\n                                      -18-\n\ffor default, because the obligation to produce the record is\n\ncreated not by the discovery rules, but by the IDEA, see 20 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1415(i)(2)(C)(i), which does not itself specify a timeline for\n\ncompliance.         The    Commonwealth    defendants       also   downplay      the\n\nuntimeliness of their responses to the various discovery orders,\n\nassert that they did not act in bad faith, note that they did\n\neventually produce the administrative record that was sought in\n\ndiscovery,    and    decry    default    as    excessively    harsh    given     the\n\ncircumstances.       Finally, the individual defendants argue that, at\n\nthe very least, sanctions should not have been imposed against\n\nthem,   because      the    IDEA   imposes     the   obligation       to   produce\n\nadministrative records on the DOE, not on them, and because they\n\nwere timely in responding to plaintiffs' discovery requests.\n\n             \"We review the trial court's imposition and selection of\n\nsanctions under [Rule 37(b)] for abuse of discretion . . . .\"                   Guex\n\nv. Allmerica Fin. Life Ins. & Annuity Co., 146 F.3d 40, 41 (1st\n\nCir. 1998) (per curiam); see also KPS & Assocs., Inc. v. Designs By\n\nFMC, Inc., 318 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir. 2003).              \"There is nothing in\n\n[Rule 37(b)] that states or suggests that [any particular sanction]\n\ncan be used only after all the other sanctions have been considered\n\nor tried.\"    Damiani v. R.I. Hosp., 704 F.2d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 1983).\n\nTherefore,     the    sanctioned    party      \"bears   a    heavy     burden     of\n\ndemonstrating that the trial judge was clearly not justified in\n\nentering an order of [default] under Rule 37.\"               Spiller v. U.S.V.\n\n\n                                        -19-\n\fLabs., Inc., 842 F.2d 535, 537 (1st Cir. 1988); see also KPS &\n\nAssocs., Inc., 318 F.3d at 13 (noting that \"the district court,\n\nfamiliar with the parties and circumstances, is best situated to\n\nweigh the reasons for and against\" default (quoting Bond Leather\n\nCo. v. Q.T. Shoe Mfg. Co., 764 F.2d 928, 938 (1st Cir. 1985))\n\n(internal quotation mark omitted)).\n\n          Although the question is close, we uphold the entry of\n\nsanctions against all defendants.     The Commonwealth defendants'\n\nargument that the IDEA does not specify a schedule for the delivery\n\nof the administrative record misses the point.      What matters is\n\nthat the district court twice ordered them to produce the record by\n\na certain date and that they failed both times to come into full\n\ncompliance with the court's order.    As to their argument that they\n\ndid not act in bad faith, Rule 37(b)(2) allows for sanctions \"[i]f\n\na party . . . fails to obey an order to provide or permit\n\ndiscovery,\" and nothing in the rule requires that the failure be on\n\naccount of bad faith.\n\n          All of the defendants violated discovery orders either by\n\nmissing clearly established deadlines or by representing to the\n\ncourt that they had complied fully with their obligations, even\n\nwhen their submissions (timely or otherwise) were incomplete,\n\nvague, or evasive.   The court's discovery orders of March 11 and\n\nApril 27, 2004 explicitly warned defendants that failure to comply\n\nfully and on time would result in sanctions, including the striking\n\n\n                               -20-\n\fof pleadings and the entry of default.              Under these circumstances,\n\nthe    district       court   was   within    its     discretion    in     imposing\n\nsanctions.9\n\n                                       III.\n\n                   Challenge to the Award of Monetary Relief\n\n               At trial, the jury found defendants liable and assessed\n\ncompensatory damages against all defendants and punitive damages\n\nagainst the individual defendants in their personal capacities.\n\nDefendants initially challenged the availability of these damages\n\nin their post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law, new\n\ntrial, or remittitur, which the district court summarily denied.\n\nWe would usually review the denial of a Rule 50(b) motion de novo\n\nand the denial of a Rule 59 motion for abuse of discretion.                      In\n\nthis       case,   however,   defendants     failed    to   raise   many    of   the\n\n\n       9\n          Defendants also argue that \"[i]t was an abuse of\ndiscretion for the [court] to have imposed sanctions on [them] for\nwhat were, at worst inadvertent discovery violations, while failing\nto even address the fact that [p]laintiffs had clearly not complied\nwith Local Rule 26(b).\" See D.P.R. R. 26(b) (\"The judicial officer\nshall not consider any discovery motion that is not accompanied by\na certification that the moving party has made a reasonable and\ngood-faith effort to reach an agreement with opposing counsel on\nthe matters set forth in the motion.\"). Defendants never invoked\nthis rule in their motion for reconsideration of the default order,\nand thus the argument is forfeited. In any case, \"[w]e generally\nwill not disturb the district court's departure from its local\nrules so long as there is sound reason for the departure and no\nparty's substantial rights have been unfairly jeopardized.\"\nGarcía-Goyco v. Law Envtl. Consultants, Inc., 428 F.3d 14, 19-20\n(1st Cir. 2005).    Here, both the plaintiffs and the court gave\ndefendants multiple opportunities to comply with outstanding\ndiscovery orders, as well as notice that sanctions would be imposed\nif compliance did not occur.\n\n                                       -21-\n\farguments raised in their post-trial motions after their pleadings\n\nhad been struck and before the jury verdict.       We thus review their\n\nunpreserved arguments for plain error.10          See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n51(d)(2) (\"A court may consider a plain error in the [jury]\n\ninstructions   affecting   substantial   rights    that   has   not   been\n\npreserved as required by Rule 51(d)(1)(A) or (B).\").11\n\nA.        Punitive Damages\n\n          Although the claims under the Rehabilitation Act against\n\nthe individual defendants and the claims under Title II of the ADA\n\nagainst all the defendants had been dismissed from the case before\n\ntrial and no claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 had ever been pleaded,\n\npurported claims under these statutes were somehow used as a basis\n\nfor a punitive damages instruction.12\n\n\n     10\n          Plaintiffs argue that a Rule 59 motion is not available\nto a party against whom a default judgment was entered. Whatever\nthe merits of this argument in an ordinary default scenario, the\ndistrict court made clear that this case does not involve a run-of-\nthe-mill default judgment entered pursuant to Rule 55 of the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n     11\n           Defendants'  challenge   on   appeal   focuses  on   the\nunavailability of the damages awards as a matter of law. We do not\nunderstand them to be raising any objection as to the sufficiency\nof the evidence in support of the jury verdict. To the extent that\nthey do raise such an argument, it is waived for lack of appellate\ndevelopment. See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st\nCir. 1990) (\"[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,\nunaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed\nwaived.\").\n     12\n          By the time this case went to trial, the only surviving\nclaims against the individual defendants were those under the IDEA\nand Puerto Rico law.     Although plaintiffs' original complaint\npleaded a Rehabilitation Act claim, after the district court\n\n                                -22-\n\f          On the final day of trial, before instructing the jury,\n\nthe district court engaged in a colloquy with the parties regarding\n\nthe jury instructions and verdict form.   When the court raised the\n\nquestion of whether punitive damages were available under the\n\ncauses of action pleaded, plaintiffs' counsel misrepresented to the\n\ncourt that punitive damages could be awarded against the individual\n\ndefendants under the Rehabilitation Act, and so were available\n\nthrough the vehicle of § 1983.13   Plaintiffs' counsel did not tell\n\nthe court that the Supreme Court had held that punitive damages\n\nwere unavailable under the Rehabilitation Act.       See Barnes v.\n\nGorman, 536 U.S. 181, 189 (2002). Defense counsel failed to object\n\nthat punitive damages were unavailable as a matter of law; failed\n\nto remind the court that not only had the Rehabilitation Act claim\n\n\ndismissed the claim against Rey in his personal capacity,\nplaintiffs amended their complaint to plead a Rehabilitation Act\nclaim solely against the Commonwealth defendants. Plaintiffs also\noriginally pleaded a cause of action under Title II of the ADA, but\nthe court correctly dismissed that claim early in the case, and\nplaintiffs took no appeal. After the entry of default, however,\nplaintiffs   attempted   to   resurrect   the   Title   II   claim,\nsurreptitiously reintroducing it by way of their proposed jury\ninstructions. Plaintiffs also floated a theory that they had an\nindependent cause of action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and submitted\njury instructions to that effect, even though neither their\noriginal or amended complaints ever alleged a § 1983 violation.\n     13\n          The court inquired of plaintiffs' counsel: \"[I]s there\ncase law that allows for the imposition of punitive damages in a\ncase like this?\" Counsel responded: \"Under the Rehabilitation Act,\nyes . . . . [T]here is case law indicating that the same damages\nthat are available generally under a 42 U.S.C. [§] 1983 case are\navailable under the Rehabilitation Act, and that would be the one\nparticular legal claim that would provide for punitive damages in\nthis case.\"\n\n                               -23-\n\fin the original complaint against Rey in his personal capacity\n\nalready been dismissed, but also that the amended complaint did not\n\nallege    a    Rehabilitation   Act   claim   against   the   individual\n\ndefendants; and failed to alert the court that the § 1983 and Title\n\nII claims were never pleaded in the amended complaint.14\n\n              In due course, the district court instructed the jury on\n\nboth Title II and § 1983, and further advised the jury that\n\npunitive damages were available under federal law,15 so long as\n\ndefendants' actions involved deliberate indifference toward the\n\nrights of another. Defendants did not make any relevant objections\n\nto these instructions or to the verdict form.       The jury proceeded\n\nto award a total of $100,000 in punitive damages to Lyssette\n\nagainst Rey and Ríos in their personal capacities.\n\n              Not until their post-verdict motion did defendants argue\n\nthat punitive damages were unavailable under the pleaded causes of\n\naction as a matter of law.        The district court issued an order\n\nsummarily denying their motion, from which they now appeal.\n\n              It is black letter law that punitive damages -- indeed\n\nmoney damages of any sort -- are not available in a private suit\n\nunder the IDEA.      See Nieves-Márquez v. Puerto Rico, 353 F.3d 108,\n\n\n     14\n          The only argument that defense counsel made as to\npunitive damages was that Rey and Ríos ought to be protected by\nqualified immunity on the federal claims because the evidence was\ninsufficient to show their personal involvement.\n     15\n          Punitive damages are not available under the Puerto Rico\nlaw claims.\n\n                                  -24-\n\f124   (1st   Cir.   2003)   (holding     that   the   only   monetary    awards\n\navailable under the IDEA are \"[a]wards of compensatory education\n\nand equitable remedies that involve the payment of money, such as\n\nreimbursements      to   parents   for    expenses    incurred    on    private\n\neducational services to which their child was later found to have\n\nbeen entitled\").         Nor are punitive damages available under the\n\nRehabilitation Act.       See id. at 126; see also Barnes, 536 U.S. at\n\n189 (\"[P]unitive damages may not be awarded in . . . suits brought\n\nunder . . . § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.\").              This was the law\n\nat the time of trial, as counsel for both sides should have known.\n\n             On appeal, plaintiffs add the argument that punitive\n\ndamages were justified under Title II of the ADA.                 The law is\n\nequally clear that no punitive damages are available under that\n\ncause of action either.         See Barnes, 536 F.3d at 189; Nieves-\n\nMárquez, 353 F.3d at 126.\n\n             Plaintiffs next attempt to recharacterize this case as a\n\n§ 1983 case and so justify an award of punitive damages.16                   We\n\n\n\n      16\n          Defendants argue that to the extent the court's\ninstructing the jury on § 1983 can be construed as permitting a\nconstructive amendment to the pleadings, such an amendment was an\nabuse of discretion on the part of the court, since it \"permitted\n[p]laintiffs to enjoy the benefits of having default entered\nagainst [d]efendants even on a claim that [plaintiffs] had not\nincluded in their [c]omplaint.\" Defendants also argue that even if\nplaintiffs properly raised a § 1983 claim, plaintiffs nevertheless\nfailed to allege or show that Ríos and Rey were personally\nresponsible for any discrimination against Lyssette.      Finally,\ndefendants argue that Ríos and Rey were entitled to qualified\nimmunity. We need not reach any of these arguments.\n\n                                    -25-\n\freject the argument and hold that § 1983 cannot be used to escape\n\nthe strictures on damages under the IDEA, which preclude both\n\npunitive damages and general compensatory damages, where the § 1983\n\nclaim is premised on a right created by the IDEA.   As we observed\n\nin Nieves-Márquez, \"if federal policy precludes money damages for\n\nIDEA claims, it would be odd for damages to be available under\n\nanother vehicle, . . . where the underlying claim is one of\n\nviolation of IDEA.\"    353 F.3d at 125; see also id. at 125-26\n\n(noting that \"[s]everal circuits have barred money damages under 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983 for IDEA-based claims for precisely this reason\").\n\nAfter all, plaintiffs cannot circumvent other requirements of the\n\nIDEA, such as the requirement to exhaust administrative remedies,\n\nsee 20 U.S.C. § 1415(l), merely by pleading under § 1983.      See\n\nFrazier v. Fairhaven Sch. Comm., 276 F.3d 52, 60-64 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).    Allowing plaintiffs to claim money damages under § 1983\n\n\"would subvert . . . the overall scheme that Congress envisioned\n\nfor dealing with educational disabilities,\" id. at 63, as well as\n\nthe purpose of the IDEA, which simply \"is to ensure FAPE,\" Nieves-\n\nMárquez, 353 F.3d at 125.   See also Sellers by Sellers    v. Sch.\n\nBd., 141 F.3d 524, 529 (4th Cir. 1998) (holding that the \"IDEA\n\nprovides a comprehensive remedial scheme for violations of its own\n\nrequirements\" that cannot be circumvented by means of a § 1983\n\nclaim).\n\n\n\n\n                               -26-\n\f            As noted in Nieves-Márquez, see 353 F.3d at 116 n.4, the\n\ntext of the IDEA specifically states that the statute does not\n\n\"restrict or limit the rights, procedures, and remedies available\n\nunder the Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities Act of\n\n1990, title V of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, or other Federal\n\nlaws protecting the rights of children with disabilities,\" 20\n\nU.S.C. § 1415(l).    This text was added as a reaction to the Supreme\n\nCourt's decision in Smith v. Robinson, 468 U.S. 992 (1984), which\n\nheld that the predecessor statute to the IDEA was \"the exclusive\n\navenue through which a plaintiff may assert an equal protection\n\nclaim to a publicly financed special education.\"            Id. at 1009.    We\n\nread the caveat set out in 20 U.S.C. § 1415(l) as intended to\n\nensure that the IDEA does not restrict rights and remedies that\n\nwere already independently available through other sources of law.\n\nSituations in which the caveat would be applicable surely exist,\n\nbut this is not one of them.       Plaintiffs' case turns entirely on\n\nthe rights created by statute in the IDEA.           They did not plead a\n\n§   1983   action   in   their   complaints,   nor    did    they   state   a\n\nconstitutional claim.     They also have no viable independent claim\n\nunder Title II of the ADA or section 504 of the Rehabilitation\n\nAct.17\n\n\n      17\n          Plaintiffs made allegations of retaliation in their\namended complaint.   However, plaintiffs have not suggested that\nthese allegations go to an independent claim under the\nRehabilitation Act, and the Rehabilitation Act claims against the\nindividual defendants were correctly dismissed.\n\n                                   -27-\n\f              We   hold   that   where    the   underlying   claim   is   one    of\n\nviolation of the IDEA, plaintiffs may not use § 1983 -- or any\n\nother federal statute for that matter -- in an attempt to evade the\n\nlimited remedial structure of the IDEA.             See Bradley v. Ark.

Compensatory Damages\n\n              In addition to the punitive damages, the jury awarded\n\ngeneral compensatory damages in the amount of $45,000 for Díaz and\n\n$3000 for Lyssette against the Commonwealth defendants and Rey and\n\nRíos, in their personal capacities.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -28-\n\f           At trial, Díaz testified that she sustained an array of\n\neconomic   damages,     including:     (1)   wages    lost   while   attending\n\nadministrative hearings and IEP meetings; (2) copying and other\n\npaperwork costs in preparation for administrative proceedings; (3)\n\nmedical deductibles for psychiatric treatment for Lyssette; (4)\n\nprivate school tuition in the amount of $3248.24 for the 2003-2004\n\nschool year and \"around $3400\" for the 2004-2005 school year\n\n(seventh and eighth grade, respectively); and (5) transportation\n\ncosts to and from private school. Díaz also testified about future\n\nexpenditures she expected to pay for Lyssette's private school\n\neducation,      adaptive   physical     education,     transportation,        and\n\npsychological     counseling    through      the   2005-2006    school   year.\n\nPlaintiffs stated in closing arguments that the sum of all of\n\nDíaz's economic damages, past and prospective, was $44,813.44.\n\nThey did not attempt to quantify damages for emotional harm, though\n\nthey   argued    that   Díaz   did    suffer   such   harm     on   account    of\n\ndefendants' conduct.       Lyssette did not testify as to any specific\n\nlosses, though she did say that defendants' actions made her feel\n\n\"bad\" and isolated, and caused her to have to seek counseling.\n\n           The court did instruct the jury on the elements of\n\nliability under an IDEA claim and on the procedural and substantive\n\nentitlements students and parents have under the IDEA, but it did\n\nnot instruct on the limited remedial options available under that\n\nstatute.     Rather, the district court instructed the jury that\n\n\n                                      -29-\n\fcompensatory     damages      were   available     under       §    1983    and    the\n\nRehabilitation    Act.        It   also    instructed    the       jury    that,   for\n\nviolations of Law 51, see P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 18, §§ 1351-1359,\n\nwhich is the Puerto Rican analog to the IDEA, Puerto Rico's general\n\nnegligence     statute     applied,       see   P.R.    Laws       Ann.    tit.    31,\n\n§§ 5141-5142, which meant that reasonable damages for emotional\n\npain, mental anguish, lost income, and medical expenses were\n\navailable.\n\n          The court then presented the jury with a general verdict\n\nform that asked, with respect to compensatory damages, \"[w]hich\n\ndefendant[s] are responsible\" and the amount of damages awarded in\n\nfavor of each plaintiff.\n\n          As     said,   we    review      defendants'     challenges        to    the\n\ncompensatory damages for plain error.18\n\n          1.

The individual defendants also argued that there was no\nsurviving federal cause of action against them in their personal\ncapacities, that they were entitled to qualified immunity, and that\nthey were not personally liable under state law.\n\n                                      -30-\n\f                   a.      Compensatory Damages on Federal Claims\n\n           The key question is whether the IDEA permitted an award\n\nof the various types of damages sought, given that we have held\n\nthat the other federal causes of action, on the facts here, do not\n\nprovide any broader remedies than those available under the IDEA.19\n\n           \"[T]ort-like money damages\" are not within the scope of\n\nappropriate relief under the IDEA, because the \"IDEA's primary\n\npurpose is to ensure FAPE, not to serve as a tort-like mechanism\n\nfor compensating personal injury.\"         Nieves-Márquez, 353 F.3d at\n\n124-25.   This was the law of this and every other circuit that had\n\naddressed the issue by the time of trial.20\n\n           In an IDEA-based suit like this one, monetary relief is\n\nlimited   to   \"[a]wards    of   compensatory   education   and   equitable\n\nremedies that involve the payment of money, such as reimbursements\n\nto parents for expenses incurred on private educational services to\n\nwhich their child was later found to have been entitled.\"           Id. at\n\n\n\n     19\n          Plaintiffs do not attempt to justify the compensatory\ndamages award under § 1983.

In fashioning appropriate relief,\n\ncourts        have   generally   interpreted      the    IDEA   as   allowing\n\nreimbursement for the cost not only of private school tuition, but\n\n\n       21\n          The issue of tuition reimbursement is, therefore, an\nissue for the judge, not the jury. In this case, however, neither\nparty raised an objection on this ground, and we have no reason to\nconclude that the court would not have granted reimbursement had it\nreserved the decision for itself. Cf. Fed. R. Civ. P. 39(c) (\"In\nall actions not triable of right by a jury the court upon motion or\nof its own initiative may try any issue with an advisory\njury . . . .\").    In fact, the court did grant partial tuition\nreimbursement as part of the declaratory judgment.\n\n                                    -32-\n\falso of \"related services,\" see 20 U.S.C. § 1401(26) (defining\n\n\"related    services\"       to     include      \"transportation,           and     such\n\ndevelopmental, corrective, and other supportive services (including\n\n. . . psychological services . . .) as may be required to assist a\n\nchild with a disability to benefit from special education\").                       See,\n\ne.g., Sch. Comm., 471 U.S. at 369 (allowing for reimbursement under\n\nthe predecessor statute to the IDEA); M.M. ex rel. C.M. v. Sch.\n\nBd., 437 F.3d 1085, 1100-01 (11th Cir. 2006) (per curiam); see also\n\n34 C.F.R. § 300.24.        This law was also clear at the time of trial.\n\n            We quickly dispose of one defense argument.                Pointing to\n\na   provision   of    the       IDEA,   which    states    that      the    cost     of\n\nreimbursement \"may be reduced or denied\" in certain circumstances,\n\nsuch as \"upon a judicial finding of unreasonableness with respect\n\nto actions taken by the parents,\" 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii),\n\ndefendants argue that Díaz was not entitled to reimbursement\n\nbecause her actions were unreasonable.              But the jury verdict and\n\ngrant of substantial damages confirmed that defendants' proposed\n\nIEPs were inadequate and untimely.              Under these circumstances, we\n\ncannot conclude that Díaz's decision to enroll Lyssette in a\n\nprivate    school    was   so    unreasonable     that    it   was   an    abuse     of\n\ndiscretion to award tuition reimbursement.\n\n            Defendants' final argument, that Díaz is not entitled to\n\nprospective relief in the amount of future educational expenses\n\nuntil Lyssette reaches maximum school age, has more bite.                        As the\n\n\n                                        -33-\n\fterm        \"reimbursement\"      suggests,       tuition    reimbursement      is    a\n\nbackward-looking form of remedial relief; \"[r]eimbursement merely\n\nrequires the [defendant] to belatedly pay expenses that it should\n\nhave paid all along and would have borne in the first instance had\n\nit developed a proper IEP.\"             Sch. Comm., 471 U.S. at 371-72.              It\n\ngoes without saying that those \"expenses\" must be actual and\n\nretrospective, not anticipated.              Indeed, this reasoning is at the\n\nheart       of    the   distinction,    recognized     by   this   court,     between\n\n\"tuition reimbursement\" and \"compensatory education.\"22                  See Ms. M.\n\nex rel. K.M., 360 F.3d at 273 (\"[W]hen this court has used the term\n\n'compensatory education,' it has usually assumed that the remedies\n\navailable involve prospective injunctive relief, which would not\n\nencompass tuition reimbursement.\"); see also id. at 273-74 (citing\n\ncases).          This was also plainly the law at the time of trial.\n\n                  Under normal IDEA principles, Díaz is thus not entitled\n\nto be reimbursed for educational expenses that she has yet to pay.\n\nShe is entitled to no more than the sum of the educational expenses\n\nshe has already paid -- that is, the sum of Lyssette's private\n\nschool       tuition     and   costs   for   transportation,       see   34    C.F.R.\n\n§      300.24(b)(15),          and     psychological        services,    see        id.\n\n\n       22\n          Plaintiffs   do   not   take   issue   with   defendants'\ncharacterization of the relevant parts of the jury award as\n\"tuition reimbursement,\" and do not attempt to recast that award as\n\"compensatory education.\"   Nor do plaintiffs argue that tuition\nreimbursements are available under Puerto Rico law.        In fact,\nplaintiffs do not respond at all to any of defendants' arguments\nwith respect to tuition reimbursement.\n\n                                          -34-\n\f§ 300.24(b)(9), that she has paid through the conclusion of the\n\n2005-2006 school year.23     All other \"compensatory damages\" awarded\n\nby the jury, including those for lost wages and emotional distress,\n\nare simply not available as a matter of law.            We discuss later\n\nwhether   defendants   are   nonetheless   bound   to   pay   damages   not\n\navailable as a matter of law because of their failure to timely\n\nobject.\n\n                  b.    State Immunity from Compensatory          Damages\n                        Under Puerto Rico Law\n\n           \"[I]n the absence of consent[,] a suit in which the State\n\nor one of its agencies or departments is named as the defendant is\n\nproscribed by the Eleventh Amendment.\"         Pennhurst State Sch. &\n\nHosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 100 (1984); see also Edelman v.\n\n\n\n     23\n          Although it is true that reimbursement can only be\nretrospective, the \"stay-put\" provision of the IDEA requires\nLyssette to remain in her \"then-current educational placement\" --\nthat is, her current private school placement -- \"during the\npendency of any [administrative or judicial] proceedings conducted\npursuant to [20 U.S.C. § 1415].\" 20 U.S.C. § 1415(j). The law\ndoes not firmly establish whether \"the pendency of any [judicial]\nproceedings\" includes review through the court of appeals, and the\nparties have not briefed the issue of whether Díaz is entitled to\nreimbursement for the costs of tuition and related services that\nshe has already incurred through the conclusion of these appellate\nproceedings. In the context of this case, in which there has been\nso many defaults on the part of the Commonwealth defendants, it is\nequitable to permit reimbursement through the school year ending\nwith the issue of our judgment -- that is, the 2005-2006 school\nyear.   We also take into consideration the facts that the jury\ndetermined that Díaz had properly enrolled Lyssette in private\nschool, that Díaz has already paid for this year's tuition and\nrelated services, and that, from what we understand, as of the date\nof issuance of this opinion, Lyssette not only has finished the\nschool year, but also has graduated from middle school.\n\n                                  -35-\n\fJordan, 415 U.S. 651, 662-63 (1974).        \"This jurisdictional bar\n\napplies regardless of the nature of the relief sought.\" Pennhurst,\n\n465 U.S. at 100.\n\n             Plaintiffs argue that the compensatory damages award, if\n\nnot available under federal law, is justifiable under §§ 1802 and\n\n1803 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code, which is the general negligence\n\nstatute.24    See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, §§ 5141, 5142.       Taking\n\nadvantage of the rule that \"Eleventh Amendment immunity can be\n\nraised at any time because of its jurisdictional implications,\"\n\nAcevedo López v. Police Dep't, 247 F.3d 26, 28 (1st Cir. 2001), the\n\nCommonwealth defendants invoke for the first time on appeal their\n\nEleventh Amendment immunity against suit in federal court on the\n\nPuerto Rico law claims.     Plaintiffs offer no response.\n\n             The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is treated as a state for\n\npurposes of Eleventh Amendment immunity analysis.     Redondo Constr.\n\nCorp. v. P.R. Highway & Transp. Auth., 357 F.3d 124, 125 n.1 (1st\n\nCir. 2004). The Commonwealth can waive its immunity in three ways:\n\n\"(1) by a clear declaration that it intends to submit itself to the\n\njurisdiction of a federal court . . . ; (2) by consent to or\n\nparticipation in a federal program for which waiver of immunity is\n\n\n     24\n          Section 1802 of the Civil Code provides: \"A person who by\nan act or omission causes damage to another through fault or\nnegligence shall be obliged to repair the damage so done.\" P.R.\nLaws Ann. tit. 31, § 5141. Section 1803 extends § 5141 to the\nCommonwealth: \"The Commonwealth is liable in this sense under the\nsame circumstances and conditions as those under which a private\ncitizen would be liable.\" Id. § 5142.\n\n                                  -36-\n\fan express condition; or (3) by affirmative conduct in litigation.\"\n\nNew Hampshire v. Ramsey, 366 F.3d 1, 15 (1st Cir. 2004) (citations\n\nomitted).        But the Commonwealth's \"waiver of sovereign immunity in\n\nits own courts is not a waiver of the Eleventh Amendment immunity\n\nin   the   federal     courts.\"     Pennhurst,    465    U.S.   at     99    n.9.\n\n             The     Commonwealth   defendants    do     not    have    Eleventh\n\nAmendment immunity against the federal IDEA and Rehabilitation Act\n\nclaims, because they waived such immunity by accepting federal\n\nfunds.     See    20 U.S.C. § 1403(a) (conditioning a state's receipt of\n\nfederal IDEA funds to its consent to suit under that statute); 42\n\nU.S.C. § 2000d-7(a)(1) (same under the Rehabilitation Act); see\n\nalso Nieves-Márquez, 353 F.3d at 127-30.\n\n             Although the Commonwealth has consented to be sued for\n\ndamages     in     actions   brought    under   the    Commonwealth         general\n\nnegligence statute, such consent does not extend to actions filed\n\nin any courts but the Commonwealth's own.             Neither Section 1802 or\n\n1803 contains an explicit waiver of the Commonwealth's sovereign\n\nimmunity.        And Law 104, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 32, § 3077, which\n\nabrogates the Commonwealth's immunity with respect to negligence\n\nsuits filed against the Commonwealth in Puerto Rico's Court of the\n\nFirst Instance, does not extend that waiver to suits filed in\n\nfederal court.        See Pennhurst, 465 U.S. at 99 & n.9 (noting that\n\n\"[a] State's constitutional interest in immunity encompasses not\n\nmerely whether it may be sued, but where it may be sued\").\n\n\n                                       -37-\n\fMoreover, as defendants point out, Law 51 itself does not waive the\n\nCommonwealth's immunity from suit in federal court; indeed, that\n\nstatute does not even explicitly authorize private suits for its\n\nenforcement in any court, let alone in federal court.25    Plaintiffs\n\ndo not direct us to any law to the contrary, nor do they argue that\n\nthe Commonwealth has waived its immunity by any other means, such\n\nas by its litigation conduct.\n\n          Defendants argue that the Commonwealth's immunity extends\n\nto its Department of Education.      This court has assumed without\n\ndiscussion   that   the   DOE's   Eleventh   Amendment   immunity   is\n\ncoextensive with that of the Commonwealth's. Fernandez v.

We do so again here, since\n\nplaintiffs have utterly failed to present any argument to the\n\ncontrary.\n\n            Plaintiffs,      therefore,     cannot   look      to    state   law    to\n\njustify the \"compensatory damages\" award against the Commonwealth\n\ndefendants.\n\n            2.        Compensatory Damages Against the Individual\n                      Defendants in Their Personal Capacities\n\n            The     jury   determined     that    each    of        the   individual\n\ndefendants    (in     addition   to   the    Commonwealth       defendants)        was\n\nresponsible for the compensatory damages award, totaling $48,000.\n\n            Our discussion earlier demonstrates that the likely basis\n\nfor the award was under the Rehabilitation Act or § 1983 theories,\n\nneither of which had been pleaded against the individual defendants\n\nin the amended complaint. We have also discussed why the award (to\n\nthe extent it represents general damages) is not, in any event,\n\nviable as a matter of law on those bases.            And so we return to what\n\nthis case is really about -- a claim under the IDEA -- to see if\n\nthe IDEA authorizes a monetary award against individuals in their\n\npersonal capacities.\n\n            Plaintiffs do not even attempt to defend the award of\n\ndamages     against    the    individuals;       they    merely       assert    that\n\ncompensatory damages are generally available against defendants as\n\na group.     We have already held that general compensatory damages\n\n                                      -39-\n\fare not available at all under the IDEA.       We add that the IDEA does\n\nnot permit an award of any monetary relief, including tuition\n\nreimbursement and compensatory education, against individual school\n\nofficials who are named in their personal capacities as defendants\n\nin an IDEA action.    As the Eighth Circuit recognized in Bradley v.\n\nArkansas Department of Education, 301 F.3d 952, \"the IDEA is devoid\n\nof textual support for . . . an award\" of education expenses\n\nagainst individual defendants; \"such expenses would be recoverable\n\n[only] from the school district\" (or public agency).           Id. at 957\n\nn.6.    Indeed,     the   plain   text    of   the   statute   authorizes\n\nreimbursement of educational expenses only against the agency, not\n\nagainst any of its officials.     See 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii)\n\n(\"If the parents of a child with a disability, who previously\n\nreceived special education and related services under the authority\n\nof a public agency, enroll the child in a private elementary school\n\nor secondary school without the consent of or referral by the\n\npublic agency, a court or a hearing officer may require the agency\n\nto reimburse the parents for the cost of that enrollment if the\n\ncourt or hearing officer finds that the agency had not made a\n\n[FAPE] available to the child in a timely manner prior to that\n\nenrollment.\"     (emphasis added)).      That only the public agency is\n\nliable for reimbursement follows naturally from the fact that\n\nCongress assigned to the agency the ultimate responsibility for\n\nensuring FAPE.     See id. § 1400(c)(6) (\"States, local educational\n\n\n                                  -40-\n\fagencies,    and    educational    service        agencies    are   primarily\n\nresponsible for providing an education for all children with\n\ndisabilities . . . .\");      id. § 1401(9)(A) (requiring that FAPE be\n\n\"provided    at    public   expense,   under      public     supervision   and\n\ndirection, and without charge\").       No claim for monetary relief can\n\nthus be stated against individual defendants under IDEA.\n\n            This leaves as a possible justification for a monetary\n\naward against the individual defendants only the pendent state\n\nclaims under Law 51, see P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 18, §§ 1351-1359, and\n\nPuerto Rico's general negligence statute, see P.R. Laws Ann. tit.\n\n31, §§ 5141-5142.      It is, in our view, doubtful that Law 51 (even\n\nwhen combined with the general negligence statute) permits private\n\nparty actions for damages against individuals in their personal\n\ncapacities, as opposed to suits against individual defendants in\n\ntheir official capacities.      Cf. Bonilla v. Chardon, 18 P.R. Offic.\n\nTrans. 696, 704, 710-11 (P.R. 1987) (allowing for an award of\n\ncompensatory damages under the general negligence statute for a\n\n\"gross\" violation of the predecessor statute to Law 51 against the\n\nDOE and its officers in their official capacities).                 Plaintiffs\n\nhave simply asserted there is such a claim.          We are not inclined to\n\nsubject   individual    state   officials    to    personal    liability   for\n\nmonetary relief in IDEA analog suits absent a clearer indication\n\nfrom the courts of Puerto Rico that such a claim is available under\n\n\n\n\n                                   -41-\n\ftheir law. Federal courts do not engage in wholesale expansion, or\n\nindeed creation, of state law theories of action.\n\n          3.      Effect of Defendants' Failure to Timely Raise\n                  Legal Defenses\n\n          Plaintiffs argue that, whatever the legal deficiencies of\n\nthe punitive and compensatory damages awards, defendants waived any\n\nchallenge to those awards by failing to object in a timely manner\n\nto the jury instructions and verdict form.    See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n51(b)(2), (c)(2) (stating that a party that has been informed of an\n\ninstruction before the jury is instructed and before final jury\n\narguments must object to the instruction on the record \"before the\n\ninstructions and arguments are delivered\"); see also Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 51(d)(1)(A).   However, \"[f]ailures to object, unless a true\n\nwaiver is involved, are [mere forfeitures that are] almost always\n\nsubject to review for plain error.\"   Chestnut v. City of Lowell,\n\n305 F.3d 18, 20 (1st Cir. 2002) (en banc) (per curiam); see also\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 51(d)(2) (\"A court may consider a plain error in\n\nthe instructions affecting substantial rights that has not been\n\npreserved as required . . . .\").   It is clear here that there was\n\nno knowing waiver by defendants, merely forfeiture.\n\n          To succeed under the plain error standard, defendants\n\nmust show that: \"(1) an error was committed; (2) the error was\n\n'plain' (i.e.[,] obvious and clear under current law); (3) the\n\nerror was prejudicial (i.e.[,] affected substantial rights); and\n\n(4) review is needed to prevent a miscarriage of justice,\" meaning\n\n                               -42-\n\fthat \"the error 'seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or\n\npublic reputation of judicial proceedings.'\"     Rivera Castillo v.\n\nAutokirey, Inc., 379 F.3d 4, 10 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting Smith v.\n\nKmart Corp., 177 F.3d 19, 26 (1st Cir. 1999); Muñiz v. Rovira, 373\n\nF.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2004)) (some internal quotation marks omitted);\n\nsee also Fed. R. Civ. P. 51 advisory committee's note (listing \"at\n\nleast\" four factors relevant to a finding of plain error: (1) \"the\n\nobviousness of the mistake,\" (2) \"[t]he importance of the error,\"\n\n(3) \"[t]he costs of correcting [the] error,\" and (4) \"the impact a\n\nverdict may have on nonparties\").   The standard is high, and \"it is\n\nrare indeed for a panel to find plain error in a civil case.\"\n\nChestnut, 305 F.3d at 20.\n\n          The present case is one of those rare occasions when the\n\nstandard is met.   Here, the errors of law were plain: punitive\n\ndamages and tort-like compensatory damages were not authorized\n\nunder any of the causes of action alive at the time of trial\n\nagainst any of the defendants.      Moreover, the legal errors were\n\nclearly prejudicial to defendants: the jury would not have granted\n\nthe $100,000 punitive damages award and over $30,000 in tort-like\n\ncompensatory damages had it not been instructed, contrary to law,\n\nthat such damages were available.       Finally, the errors, while\n\ncompounded by defendants' silence, were in major part created by\n\nplaintiffs' active misleading of the court as to the law.\n\n\n\n\n                               -43-\n\f            Allowing the award to stand would be a miscarriage of\n\njustice.     See id. (reviewing for plain error and vacating a\n\npunitive damages award, in part because allowing the award to stand\n\nwould be a miscarriage of justice); Hurley v. Atl. City Police\n\nDep't, 174 F.3d 95, 123-24 (3d Cir. 1999) (same); Williams v. City\n\nof New York, 508 F.2d 356, 362 (2d Cir. 1974) (vacating punitive\n\ndamages award against defendant municipality on plain error review\n\nbecause of \"the demonstrable deviation of the court's instruction\n\nhere from the appropriate standard, the serious harm suffered by\n\nthe defendant as a result of this error, and the remediability of\n\nthis error without a new trial below\").\n\n            This is especially so because the windfall of such awards\n\nto IDEA plaintiffs would likely come at the expense of other\n\neducational benefits for other schoolchildren by diverting from\n\nthem scarce educational resources.       See Chestnut, 305 F.3d at\n\n20-21.     The Supreme Court recognized this principle in City of\n\nNewport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., 453 U.S. 247 (1981), in which it\n\nvacated, on plenary review, an award under § 1983 of punitive\n\ndamages against a municipality, even though defendants failed to\n\nobject to the charge at trial, in part because \"punitive damages\n\nimposed on a municipality are in effect a windfall to a fully\n\ncompensated plaintiff, and are likely accompanied by an increase in\n\ntaxes or a reduction of public services for the citizens footing\n\nthe bill.\"    Id. at 267.   The Court also observed that \"[n]either\n\n\n                                 -44-\n\freason nor justice suggests that such retribution should be visited\n\nupon the shoulders of blameless or unknowing taxpayers.\"             Id.   In\n\nChestnut, this court, sitting en banc, vacated damages on plain\n\nerror review in similar circumstances.26         See 305 F.3d at 22.\n\n               We are also influenced by the fact that it would be a\n\nmiscarriage of justice to allow an award to stand, where that award\n\nwas brought about by plaintiffs' misleading the court about the\n\nlaw.        See id. at 20 (finding a \"miscarriage of justice\" where\n\n\"[p]laintiff's      counsel,   quite    erroneously,   represented   to    the\n\ndistrict court at the charge conference that punitive damages were\n\npermissible against a municipality\").          Had plaintiffs not misled\n\nthe court as to the law and defendants not stood silent, we doubt\n\nthe jury would ever have been asked to award punitive damages.\n\n\n\n       26\n          In Chestnut, this court vacated a jury award of $500,000\nin punitive damages against the co-defendant municipality, where\ndefense counsel remained silent as plaintiff's counsel misled the\ncourt that punitive damages were available, even though a\ntwenty-year-old Supreme Court precedent held otherwise; neither\nparty brought the precedent to the attention of the trial court\nuntil after the jury verdict; and the windfall to the plaintiff\nwould have come at the expense of innocent taxpayers. See 305 F.3d\nat 20-21.\n     Plaintiffs argue that Chestnut is inapposite because it\nvacated damages solely as to the municipality, not as to the\nco-defendant police officer who was sued in his personal capacity.\nThey point out that the punitive damages here were assessed against\nRey and Ríos in their personal capacities, and not against the\nCommonwealth   defendants.      But  the   Commonwealth   generally\nindemnifies its officials for suits against them in their personal\ncapacities, see P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 32, § 3085, and it has not\ndeclared its intention not to do so in this case. Moreover, here,\nas in Chestnut, other factors in addition to impact on nonparties\nmilitate strongly in favor of vacating the damages award.\n\n                                       -45-\n\fCounsel have a duty to be candid about the law, and the trial\n\ncourt, bearing a heavy caseload, relies on counsel to meet that\n\nduty.   Given the press of work, our trial court system would break\n\ndown if the court had to stop and independently research every\n\npoint of law on which counsel appear to agree or, at least, not to\n\ndisagree.    The situation here is especially egregious because the\n\ndistrict court explicitly asked whether punitive damages were\n\navailable and gave both parties an opportunity to respond.\n\n            Further,   to   let   this   award   stand    would   contravene\n\nCongress's intent as expressed in the IDEA.              In choosing not to\n\nauthorize tort-like monetary damages or punitive damages in cases\n\nunder the IDEA, Congress made a balanced judgment that such damages\n\nwould be an unjustified remedy for this statutorily created cause\n\nof action.    No doubt Congress had in mind that public elementary\n\nand secondary education have access to only limited resources and\n\nthat a sizeable damages award would divert resources to litigants\n\nand away from direct expenditure on education.            In this case, the\n\npublic interest in not sustaining the award outweighs the public\n\ninterest in a smoothly functioning judicial system, which generally\n\nrequires parties to state their defenses or lose them.\n\n            Defendants should take little comfort in this outcome.\n\nA continuing pattern of poor advocacy by the Commonwealth in IDEA\n\ncases could lead to the balance tipping the other way in future\n\n\n\n\n                                   -46-\n\fcases. One understands the palpable frustration of the trial judge.\n\n          As to the monetary relief authorized by law, we cannot\n\nknow whether the jury would have awarded any damages to plaintiffs\n\nhad defendants not been precluded from presenting evidence as a\n\nresult of the default order.    Perhaps defendants would have won on\n\nliability.    We leave in place the monetary relief awarded by the\n\njury that was available under the law and remand to the district\n\ncourt for such adjustments as are appropriate.\n\n                                    IV.\n\n             Challenge to the Grant of Declaratory Relief\n\n          We turn to defendants' final challenge, which is to the\n\ndeclaratory    judgment   entered    by    the   district   court,   which\n\neffectively also encompassed declaratory relief.\n\n          In their amended complaint, plaintiffs requested only\n\nthat the court \"[d]eclar[e] the defendants to be in violation of\n\nthe IDEA, the Rehabilitation Act, Law 51, and the Puerto Rico\n\nConstitution,\" pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, and that it grant\n\n\"further necessary and proper relief as provided for under 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2202.\"\n\n          The problem arises because after the trial, in a motion,\n\nplaintiffs asked for more extensive and specific declaratory and\n\ninjunctive relief,27 in the form of the following five items:\n\n\n     27\n          Plaintiffs styled their motion as a \"Request for\nDeclaratory Relief\"; nevertheless, the nature of the relief sought\nand granted went beyond a mere declaration of rights.\n\n                                    -47-\n\f        (1) [T]he reinstatement of Lyssette\nCardona Díaz with respect to prospective\nreceipt of benefits to which she is entitled\nas a physically disabled student under . . .\nthe Rehabilitation Act . . . and the [IDEA].\nSpecifically, plaintiffs request that the\ndefendants provide [Lyssette] with adapted\nphysical   education,    i.e.,  swimming,   in\naccordance with her special physical needs,\nthe   reinstatement   of   her  transportation\nservices, as well as the current private\nschool placement and psychiatric services, at\npublic expense.     The provision of these\nbenefits should continue until [Lyssette]\nreaches the maximum public school age.     The\nplaintiffs also request as ancillary relief\nthat the Court impose a daily accruing fine if\nthe defendants fail to comply with this\ndictate in a timely fashion.\n\n       (2) [A] declaration of plaintiff Marta\nDíaz    Fonseca's    compliance   with    the\nrequirements for unilateral placement by\nparents of children in private schools at\npublic expense according to [the] IDEA, and\nthat therefore she is entitled to the\nreimbursement of the costs of [Lyssette's]\nplacement . . . . Specifically, as ancillary\nrelief to this declaration, the plaintiffs\nrequest that the Court order reimbursement of\n$3,298.24 for school year 2003-2004; and\n$1,220.00 paid as of October[] 2004 for [the]\n2004-2005 school year, for a total of\n$4,518.24 to be reimbursed by defendant\nDepartment of Education.\n\n        (3)   [A]    declaration    that   the\ndefendants' system of hiring administrative\nlaw   judges  under   the   auspices   of  the\nDepartment of Education is illegal and\nviolative of the pertinent provisions of the\n[IDEA], which requires that said judges not be\nemployees of a regulated body and instead be\nindependent.    Plaintiffs request that this\nCourt set reasonable terms and timelines for\nthe defendants to come into compliance with\napplicable law.\n\n\n                    -48-\n\f                 (4)    [A]   declaration    that   the\n          defendants' system of parental involvement in\n          the IEP process and their system of keeping\n          minutes and maintaining appropriate, complete\n          administrative records violates the [IDEA].\n          The plaintiffs also request as ancillary\n          relief that the Court impose a daily accruing\n          fine if the defendants fail to comply with\n          this these [sic] requirements henceforth in a\n          timely fashion.\n\n                 (5)    [A]   declaration    that    the\n          defendants' system of provision of physical\n          therapy without the referral or prescription\n          of a medical doctor violates Puerto Rico Law,\n          [P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 20, § 241(2)].        The\n          plaintiffs also request as ancillary relief\n          that the Court impose a daily accruing fine if\n          the defendants fail to comply with this these\n          [sic] requirements henceforth in a timely\n          fashion.\n\n          Over defendants' objections, the district court summarily\n\ngranted on January 3, 2005 the entirety of plaintiffs' motion and\n\ngave defendants thirty days to comply with the declaratory judgment\n\norder.   The court then denied on February 7, 2005 defendants'\n\nmotion to reconsider, alter, or amend that order. The court backed\n\nup its order with threats of contempt and monetary sanctions for\n\nnon-compliance.\n\n          We agree with defendants that the district court abused\n\nits discretion in granting the order and reverse and vacate the\n\ndeclaratory judgment in its entirety.\n\nA.        The Relevant Law\n\n          \"The Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202\n\n. . . , empowers a federal court to grant declaratory relief in a\n\n\n                               -49-\n\fcase of actual controversy.\"      Ernst & Young v. Depositors Econ.\n\nProtection Corp., 45 F.3d 530, 534 (1st Cir. 1995).               The Act\n\n\"neither imposes an unflagging duty upon the courts to decide\n\ndeclaratory judgment actions nor grants an entitlement to litigants\n\nto demand declaratory remedies.\"     El Dia, Inc. v. Hernandez Colon,\n\n963 F.2d 488, 493 (1st Cir. 1992).        \"Consequently, federal courts\n\nretain   substantial    discretion   in    deciding   whether    to   grant\n\ndeclaratory relief.\"     Ernst & Young, 45 F.3d at 534.\n\n           Our review of the district court's exercise of its\n\ndecision to grant declaratory relief \"is conducted under a standard\n\nslightly more rigorous than abuse of discretion.\"               Nat'l R.R.\n\nPassenger Corp. v. Providence & Worcester R.R. Co., 798 F.2d 8, 10\n\n(1st Cir. 1986).       \"This approach requires that we attentively\n\ndigest the facts and the district court's stated reasons for\n\ngranting . . . declaratory relief.\"       El Dia, Inc., 963 F.2d at 492.\n\nUltimately, \"we cede some deference to the trier, especially as to\n\nfindings of fact, but we will not hesitate to act upon our\n\nindependent judgment if it appears that a mistake has been made.\"\n\nId.\n\n           Some   of   the   declaratory    relief    is   particular    to\n\nplaintiffs.   Much of it is far broader and intended to effectuate\n\nwhat is essentially class-wide relief.        This case has never been\n\nstyled as a class action, no class has ever been certified, and\n\nthere is no evidence on which such broad relief can be justified.\n\n\n                                  -50-\n\fFurther, the request for these specific items of declaratory relief\n\nwas made at the last minute, and defendants were not on notice\n\nduring the trial that such relief would be sought.                    From these\n\nfacts alone, the declaratory relief must be vacated.                Still, we go\n\non to deal with the other problems with each portion of the order.\n\nB.           Items 1 and 2\n\n             We begin with the first two items of relief set forth in\n\nthe declaratory judgment order. The first item requires defendants\n\nto provide Lyssette with an array of benefits to which she claims\n\nto be entitled under the IDEA and the Rehabilitation Act through\n\nmaximum school age and at public expense.           The second declaration\n\nis    that   Díaz    was    fully   compliant    with   the    IDEA    when     she\n\nunilaterally enrolled Lyssette in private school and is thus\n\nentitled     to     reimbursement    of   educational    expenses       totaling\n\n$4518.24, pursuant to 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii).\n\n             As to the first item of declaratory relief, defendants\n\nreiterate their objection that plaintiffs are at most entitled to\n\nreimbursement of expenses, not to prospective relief under the IDEA\n\nand   the    Rehabilitation     Act.      Plaintiffs    do    not     respond    to\n\ndefendants' argument; instead, they rehash the ways in which\n\ndefendants violated plaintiffs' procedural rights under the IDEA.\n\nWe have already explained why plaintiffs are entitled only to\n\nreimbursement       for    actual   expenses    incurred,     not   anticipated\n\n\n\n\n                                       -51-\n\fexpenditures for services for which plaintiffs have yet to pay.28\n\nCf. Emery v. Roanoke City Sch. Bd., 432 F.3d 294, 299 (4th Cir.\n\n2005)     (holding    that    \"[s]tanding    doctrine    requires    that\n\nreimbursement [under the IDEA] should flow only to those who\n\nactually . . . incurred the expense and suffered the subsequent\n\nmonetary injury\" and therefore that student lacked standing to seek\n\nreimbursement, where his father's insurance covered the expenses\n\nand \"he suffered no out-of-pocket loss himself\").\n\n            As to the second item of declaratory relief, defendants\n\nargue that it impermissibly duplicated relief that was already\n\ngranted    by   the   jury.    Plaintiffs   again   do   not   respond   to\n\ndefendants' argument; they reiterate only that the declaration is\n\nwarranted in light of the record.         We agree with defendants that\n\nthe declaration is redundant and that the ancillary monetary relief\n\namounts to impermissible double recovery.           Cf. Ponce v. Ashford\n\nPresbyterian Cmty. Hosp., 238 F.3d 20, 22, 25 (1st Cir. 2001)\n\n(declining to consider the sufficiency of the evidence in a case in\n\nwhich \"the jury's award [was] redundant with plaintiffs' prior\n\n\n\n     28\n          Although the amended complaint did seek \"the cost of\nappropriate remedial services, including educational services,\"\nplaintiffs do not characterize the prospective relief requested\nhere as compensatory education.     Even if they were to have so\ncharacterized their claim, their arguments justifying such relief\non the basis of defendants' procedural violations of the IDEA would\nnonetheless be off the mark, as this court has \"recognize[d] that\ncompensatory education is not an appropriate remedy for a purely\nprocedural violation of the IDEA.\" Me. Sch. Admin. Dist. No. 35 v.\nMr. R., 321 F.3d 9, 19 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n                                   -52-\n\fsettlement    and    hence    constitute[d]    an    impermissible\n\ndouble-recovery\").\n\n          Nor is this item of relief any less redundant in light of\n\nthe outcome of this appeal.   Although we reversed and vacated all\n\nother compensatory damages, we let stand the award of reimbursement\n\nfor the educational expenses Díaz actually incurred, including\n\ntuition for the 2003-2004 and 2004-2005 school years. While \"[t]he\n\nexistence of another adequate remedy does not preclude a judgment\n\nfor declaratory relief in cases where it is appropriate,\" Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 57, plaintiffs are not entitled to use the declaratory\n\njudgment device as an instrument to double their recovery, in the\n\nabsence of any authority allowing for double damages.   See, e.g.,\n\nPate v. Nat'l Fund Raising Consultants, Inc., 20 F.3d 341, 345-46\n\n(8th Cir. 1994) (reversing declaratory judgment on the ground that\n\nit was \"an impermissible 'double recovery' because the court\n\nalready entered judgment on a jury verdict for actual damages\").\n\nWe thus reverse and vacate the first and second items in the\n\ndeclaratory judgment order.\n\nC.        Items 3 and 4\n\n          The next two declarations are that defendants' systems of\n\n(1) hiring ALJs and (2) \"parental involvement in the IEP process\n\nand . . . keeping minutes and maintaining appropriate, complete\n\nadministrative records\" are in violation of the IDEA.   Defendants'\n\ncore objection is that these declarations, in denouncing the whole\n\n\n                               -53-\n\fsystem of special education, go beyond the bounds of the complaint\n\nand the evidence in this case.          We agree.\n\n              These declarations have potentially far-reaching effects\n\non the special education system in Puerto Rico, as well as on the\n\nadministrative law system there and beyond.                The Supreme Court has\n\n\"cautioned     against    declaratory      judgments      on   issues      of   public\n\nmoment, even falling short of constitutionality, in speculative\n\nsituations.\" Pub. Affairs Assocs., Inc. v. Rickover, 369 U.S. 111,\n\n112 (1962) (per curiam) (citing Eccles v. Peoples Bank, 333 U.S.\n\n426, 432 (1948)); see also Ernst & Young, 45 F.3d at 535 (noting\n\nthat a court's \"discretion to grant declaratory relief is to be\n\nexercised with great circumspection when matters of public moment\n\nare involved\").       Here, the declarations do not meet the test that\n\n\"the   need    [for   such   pronouncements         be]   clear,     not   remote    or\n\nspeculative.\"       El Dia, Inc., 963 F.2d at 494 (quoting Wash. Pub.\n\nPower Supply Sys. v. Pac. Nw. Power Co., 332 F.2d 87, 88 (9th Cir.\n\n1964));    see     also   Eccles,    333     U.S.    at   431.        Further,      the\n\ndeclarations violate the usual rule that the scope of declaratory\n\nrelief    cannot    exceed   the    issues    raised      by   the   pleadings      and\n\nsupported by the evidence. See 10B Wright et al., Federal Practice\n\nand Procedure § 2768, at 669 (3d ed. 1998).\n\n              1.      Item 3\n\n              The declaration that defendants' system for hiring ALJs\n\nviolates the IDEA exceeds the scope of the allegations in the\n\n\n                                      -54-\n\famended complaint, as well as the evidence presented at trial. The\n\namended complaint alleged only the following with respect to the\n\nadministrative proceedings: that Díaz's administrative complaint\n\n\"was left aside without resolution in excess of the 45 days\n\nestablished for those proceedings\" and that \"plaintiffs were denied\n\na fair administrative hearing conducted by an impartial hearing\n\nofficer.\"    The amended complaint made no mention of the system of\n\nhiring ALJs; nor did it state any connection between that system\n\nand the DOE's alleged failure to provide plaintiffs with a fair and\n\ntimely resolution of their claims before the agency.\n\n            The     evidence        presented      at   trial     was     similarly\n\ninconclusive.       Plaintiffs called to the stand Marlene Aponte\n\nCabrera, a former ALJ with the DOE who had been terminated after a\n\nhalf-year    of    service.         Aponte   had   no   direct    involvement       in\n\nplaintiffs' administrative proceedings, but was allowed to testify\n\nto, in the district court's words, \"the way they handled things\n\nthere, at the [DOE].\"              Over defendants' hearsay and relevance\n\nobjections, plaintiffs elicited testimony from Aponte that she\n\npersonally did not feel independent in her judgments; that she \"was\n\ncalled    upon    some   of    [her]   decisions\";      and   that    \"there      were\n\nmeetings,\"   convened         by   certain   DOE   officials,29      in   which   her\n\n\n     29\n          Aponte's testimony was unclear as to which DOE officials\nconvened these meetings. She stated that \"[e]ither Iris Rivera or\nfrom the legal department, the secretary, . . . would call the\"\nmeetings. Rivera, Aponte later explained, was \"in administrative\nremedies,\" though it is not clear what Rivera's position was in\n\n                                        -55-\n\f\"decision[s] and [those] of other judges [were] discussed.\" Aponte\n\nalso testified that less than twenty-four hours after a meeting in\n\nwhich Sonia Rosario, head of the special education section of the\n\nDOE, questioned Aponte about two of her recent decisions,30 her\n\ncontract with the DOE was rescinded.31\n\n          Aponte's testimony, even if true, does not support a\n\nbroad declaration pronouncing the entire system of hiring ALJs in\n\nviolation of the IDEA.   Other than confirming that she signed a\n\nwritten contract with the DOE, Aponte did not even testify about\n\nthe DOE's hiring practices for hearing officers.\n\n          Plaintiffs rely primarily on what they allege are the\n\nterms of a written contract of employment between the DOE and\n\nhearing officers to argue that the declaration was proper.     The\n\n\nthat department. It is also not obvious whether \"the secretary\"\nrefers to Rey, the Secretary of Education, or to a secretary in the\nlegal department.\n     30\n          Aponte testified that she \"was asked, in front of the\nother judges, by Ms. Rosario that -- what was I thinking to put\nsuch a steep penalty on the Department [by assessing a daily fine\nagainst the DOE in one case]? It wasn't -- those weren't the exact\nwords that she told me, but she told me: What happened . . . that\nmade you take that position [in that case]?\"\n          As to the other case, Aponte testified that \"they told me\nI couldn't do that, that wasn't the way to do it, because that\nwould affect the way they operated, because I mentioned a specific\naccount number in my decision.\" It is not clear from the context\nwhat it was precisely that Aponte did.\n     31\n          Defendants attempted to impeach Aponte by eliciting from\nher testimony designed to show that she was actually terminated\nbecause she represented a party as an attorney in a suit against\nthe DOE while she was serving as an ALJ, and that she held a grudge\nagainst the DOE because of her termination.\n\n                               -56-\n\fcontract itself was not admitted into evidence during Aponte's\n\ntestimony; the record citations plaintiffs provide are not to the\n\ncontract or to any document that would support their allegations;\n\nand, to the extent that the contract is buried somewhere within the\n\nadministrative record and the fifteen volumes of appendices the\n\nparties     have   submitted     to   this     court,   it     is    plaintiffs'\n\nresponsibility to direct the court's attention to it.                 Since the\n\nthird item of declaratory relief is devoid of evidentiary support,\n\nthe district court abused its discretion in granting it.\n\n            2.       Item 4\n\n            For    related    reasons,   the   district      court   abused   its\n\ndiscretion in entering the fourth item of declaratory relief, which\n\ndeclares Puerto Rico's systems of \"parental involvement in the IEP\n\nprocess[,] . . . keeping minutes[,] and maintaining appropriate,\n\ncomplete administrative records\" in violation of the IDEA.                    The\n\njury verdict established that defendants failed in this case to\n\ninvolve the parent in the IEP process and to maintain complete\n\nadministrative records.32        The amended complaint does not allege,\n\nand the evidence at trial did not show, that the failures are\n\nsystemic.    See St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Lawson Bros. Iron\n\nWorks, 428 F.2d 929, 931 (10th Cir. 1970) (\"The judgment in a suit\n\n\n\n     32\n          Plaintiffs have not directed us to any provision in the\nIDEA that requires the keeping of minutes as a matter of course.\nAt trial, plaintiffs' counsel asked Díaz whether the keeping of\nminutes was required by law. She replied: \"I require it.\"\n\n                                      -57-\n\ffor declaratory judgment must be responsive to the pleadings and\n\nissues presented[,] and . . . a judgment which goes beyond the\n\nissues     presented      constitutes    an        advisory    opinion         upon   a\n\nhypothetical basis, which the court cannot give.\"                        (citing Bus.\n\nMen's Assurance Co. v. Sainsbury, 110 F.2d 995 (10th Cir. 1940))).\n\nPlaintiffs represent no one but themselves, and they are not\n\nentitled to relief that goes beyond the scope of what is necessary\n\nto remedy the harms caused to them.\n\nD.            Item 5\n\n              The fifth and final item of declaratory relief states\n\nthat \"defendants' system of provision of physical therapy without\n\nthe referral or prescription of a medical doctor violates Puerto\n\nRico law.\"       See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 20, § 241(2) (defining a\n\nphysical      therapist   as   \"[a]    professional      .     .    .    who    applies\n\nphysiotherapy or physical therapy following the diagnosis and\n\nprescription or the referral of a physician\").                          The item goes\n\nbeyond a mere declaration to require defendants to come into\n\ncompliance with Puerto Rico law, \"impos[ing] a daily accruing fine\n\n. . . [for] fail[ure] to comply . . . in a timely fashion.\"\n\n              Apart from the lack of evidence in the record on which\n\nany such relief could be granted, the declaration suffers from an\n\neven   more    serious    infirmity:    it    is    contrary       to    the   Eleventh\n\nAmendment.      While Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908), permits\n\ninjunctive relief based on federal constitutional claims, it does\n\n\n                                       -58-\n\fnot allow injunctive relief against state officials for violation\n\nof state law, which is the issue here.         See id. at 155-56.       In this\n\nsituation, the Eleventh Amendment bar still holds, because \"[a]\n\nfederal court's grant of relief against state officials on the\n\nbasis of state law, whether prospective or retroactive, does not\n\nvindicate the supreme authority of federal law.\"              Pennhurst, 465\n\nU.S. at 106.    As the Court noted in Pennhurst, \"it is difficult to\n\nthink of a greater intrusion on state sovereignty than when a\n\nfederal court instructs state officials on how to conform their\n\nconduct to state law.\"      Id.\n\n            The fifth declaration plainly runs afoul of Pennhurst.\n\nThe    declaration   not   only    requires   the   federal   court   to    make\n\npronouncements on the lawfulness of the Commonwealth and its\n\nofficials' conduct with respect to the Commonwealth's own law, but\n\nalso has the effect of permitting a federal court to direct\n\nCommonwealth officials to comply with that law.               See O'Brien v.\n\nMass. Bay Transp. Auth., 162 F.3d 40, 44 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"It is\n\nnot the proper purview of a federal court to supervise state\n\nofficials' compliance with state law.\"); see also Cuesnongle v.\n\nRamos, 835 F.2d 1486, 1496-98 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\n            Plaintiffs' sole response is a non sequitur.          They argue\n\nthat    \"medical     evaluations     are    available   under\"    the      IDEA.\n\nNevertheless, the relief sought is still under state law.                    And\n\nthere is no reference to medical evaluations under 20 U.S.C.\n\n\n                                     -59-\n\f§ 1401(22), the section of the IDEA to which they cite.       That\n\nsection defines the term \"outlying area\" for the purpose of the\n\nIDEA.\n\n                                V.\n\n          We affirm the district court's default sanction against\n\ndefendants.   We reverse and vacate the punitive and compensatory\n\ndamages awards against Rey and Ríos in their personal capacities\n\nand order dismissal of those claims.   We also reverse and vacate\n\nthe compensatory damages award against the Commonwealth defendants,\n\nwith the exception of the award of reimbursement for educational\n\nexpenses of tuition, transportation, and psychological services\n\nthat Díaz has actually incurred during the 2003-2006 school years,\n\nand remand to the district court for the calculation of the amount\n\nof the reimbursement, for which only the Commonwealth defendants\n\nare liable.   The district court may reopen the record and take\n\nevidence for the limited purpose of determining the appropriate\n\namount of the reimbursement.   Finally, we reverse and vacate the\n\ndeclaratory judgment, and order dismissal of those claims.\n\n          No costs are allowed.33\n\n\n\n\n     33\n          In their reply briefs, defendants requested compensation\nfrom plaintiffs for the cost of translating certain documents and\nsought sanctions against plaintiffs for their litigation conduct.\nWe deny both of these belated requests.\n\n                               -60-\n\f",

The dispute led to a jury verdict and an award of compensatory damages in the amount of $45,000 to D&#237;az and $3000 to Lyssette against all of the defendants. The jury also assessed a total of $100,000 in punitive damages against the two individual defendants, Csar Rey-Hernndez and Nitza Ros-Malav, in their personal capacities. Those two individuals respectively hold the offices of Secretary of Education of the Commonwealth and Supervisor of the Special Education Program of Cidra School District. The district court also entered broad declaratory and injunctive relief in favor of plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We vacate most of the relief granted, leaving intact only the award of reimbursement for the sum of private school tuition and costs for transportation and psychological services incurred by plaintiffs during the 2003-2004, 2004-2005, and 2005-2006 school years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case demonstrates significant confusion about the governing law in cases alleging denial of FAPE, including confusion over the limitations on monetary relief available, the limitations on suits against school administrators in their personal capacities, and the scope of immunity available to the Commonwealth in federal court. Unfortunately, as a result of counsel for plaintiffs' lack of candor about the law to the district court and defense counsel's failures to comply with court orders and to make appropriate objections on defendants' behalf, the case comes to us in a posture in which a jury has awarded damages not available in IDEA and Rehabilitation Act actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to clarify, we outline the core holdings of this case:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Where the essence of the claim is one stated under the IDEA for denial of FAPE, no greater remedies than those authorized under the IDEA are made available by recasting the claim as one brought under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, Title II of the ADA, or section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. No punitive damages may be awarded in such a suit, regardless of which of the causes of action listed above is invoked.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. No general compensatory damages may be awarded in such a suit, regardless of which of the causes of action listed above is invoked.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Monetary recovery in such suits is limited to compensatory education and equitable remedies that involve the payment of money, such as reimbursements for educational expenses that would have been borne by defendants in the first instance had they properly developed and implemented an IEP. Under the category of \"reimbursement,\" parents may recover only actual, not anticipated, expenditures for private tuition and related services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. No claim for monetary relief is stated in such cases against individual school administrators who are sued in their personal capacities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">6. A state, here the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, may waive Eleventh Amendment immunity from monetary liability as to IDEA and Rehabilitation Act claims in federal court by accepting federal funds. This does not mean that the state has waived its immunity as to pendent state law claims being heard in federal court. Here, although the Commonwealth waived its immunity from suit in federal court on the federal claims, it did not waive its immunity from suit in federal court on the pendent state law claims under Law 51, <i>see</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 18, &#167;&#167; 1351-1359, and Puerto Rico's general negligence statute, <i>see</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, &#167;&#167; 5141-5142.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying these principles, we conclude that the harm to the public interest requires that we reverse and vacate the entirety of the punitive damages award and all compensatory damages against Rey and R&#237;os in their personal capacities. We also vacate those portions of the compensatory damages award against the Commonwealth that are not available as monetary relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Frustrated with the defendants' many defalcations in this case, the district court also granted in full plaintiffs' belated request for injunctive and declaratory relief. We reverse and vacate the entirety of the declaratory and injunctive relief awarded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no reason to detail the many facts and procedural events in this case and every reason to avoid a focus on the irrelevant. The crux of the dispute is that while the parties agreed that Lyssette could not engage in ordinary physical education and thus needed adaptive physical education, they could not agree over what type of adaptive physical education was appropriate. The public schools lacked swimming pools and declined to pay for swim lessons. D&#237;az insisted that her daughter needed such lessons and that the schools should have to pay for them, as well as for transportation to and from school and for the psychiatric treatment Lyssette required after she became depressed because she could not engage in physical education with her classmates. Feeling frustrated that Lyssette was not receiving any adaptive physical education and that the defendants had engaged in a classic bureaucratic runaround, D&#237;az unilaterally removed Lyssette from public school in 2003 and placed her in a private school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time the litigation began in September 2002, Lyssette was an eleven-year-old public school student. She had been diagnosed in February 2001 with spina bifida and Klippel-Feil Syndrome, as a result of which she suffers from certain physical limitations, such as a circumscribed range of motion in the neck and cervical spine. In August 2001, after a physician recommended that Lyssette refrain from further participation in traditional physical education classes, D&#237;az registered Lyssette in the special education program administered by the DOE<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and requested that Lyssette be provided with specially designed physical education services. <i>See</i> 34 C.F.R. &#167; 300.307(a) (\"Physical education services, specially designed if necessary, must be made available to every child with a disability receiving FAPE.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 4, 2001, the DOE convened a meeting with D&#237;az and other members of Lyssette's IEP team, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 300.16 (defining \"IEP team\" as \"a group of individuals . . . that is responsible for developing, reviewing, or revising an IEP for a child with a disability\"); <i>see also id.</i> &#167; 300.344 (specifying the composition of IEP teams), to produce an IEP for Lyssette. Their deliberations resulted in an IEP for the 2001-2002 school year; this IEP did not provide for special physical education services&#8212;specifically, swim classes, which, plaintiffs have maintained, was the only sport Lyssette could safely practice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The DOE told D&#237;az that it could not provide swim instruction because it did not have any schools equipped with a pool, and that D&#237;az would have to pay out-of-pocket for private swim lessons elsewhere.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D&#237;az filed an administrative complaint with the Commonwealth's DOE on November 27, 2001, requesting that it provide Lyssette with publicly funded swim classes. An administrative law judge (ALJ) eventually found that the DOE did not have the obligation to offer Lyssette swim lessons, because it was not clear from the IEP that swimming was the most appropriate physical education alternative for Lyssette. The ALJ did, however, order that Lyssette receive physical education at the same frequency as her non-disabled classmates, and further directed the parties to meet again to determine, with the help of a specialist, whether swimming was the most appropriate physical education alternative for Lyssette. That order was not handed down until June 14, 2002, far beyond the forty-five days provided by the regulations for resolution of an administrative complaint. <i>See</i> 34 C.F.R. &#167; 300.511(a)(1) (\"The public agency shall ensure that not later than 45 days after the receipt of a request for a hearing... [a] final decision is reached in the hearing....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several unsuccessful attempts to convene an IEP meeting followed; each meeting was cancelled by someone from the school or the DOE. In the end, Lyssette did not receive a revised IEP for her sixth-grade year, which was the 2002-2003 school year; rather, with D&#237;az's permission, Lyssette spent time with her Spanish teacher while her classmates were in physical education class.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 2003, the IEP team convened to create a revised IEP for the 2003-2004 school year. At that meeting, co-defendant R&#237;os told D&#237;az that she had been instructed to inform D&#237;az that they were not going to develop a new IEP for Lyssette. D&#237;az testified that R&#237;os refused to take minutes of the meeting and that R&#237;os and the other school personnel present abruptly ended the meeting when D&#237;az attempted to record the proceedings. No revised IEP was produced and agreed upon by the IEP team for the 2003-2004 school year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lyssette graduated from sixth grade in June 2003, which meant that she had to transfer to a middle school. In July of that year, D&#237;az met with DOE and school officials to discuss Lyssette's placement options for the following year. D&#237;az requested that her daughter be enrolled in the Dejas School, because of that school's proximity to Lyssette's grandmother's house and the Puerto Rican Medical Center, where Lyssette's neurosurgeon and orthopedic surgeon practiced. The DOE, however, notified D&#237;az that the school of her choice was not available; that the normal placement procedures for regular-education students applied to Lyssette; and that under those procedures, Lyssette could not enroll in the Dejas School, but instead must choose from two schools closer in proximity to her home. The topic of physical education was not raised during this meeting and was not mentioned as a criterion for D&#237;az's choice of schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D&#237;az then informed the DOE that its proffered options were not acceptable and that she would be withdrawing Lyssette from public school and placing her in private school during the 2003-2004 school year at public cost. Lyssette was eventually enrolled in a private school close to her grandmother's home; that school was equipped with a swimming pool, but, according to D&#237;az, Lyssette did not take swim lessons there because physical education was not a part of the regular curriculum and extracurricular lessons were prohibitively expensive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The DOE initiated a second administrative proceeding in July 2003, challenging Lyssette's placement in the private school. That proceeding was resolved in the DOE's favor on December 10, 2003, which was apparently also in excess of the forty-five-day deadline imposed by the regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the interim, Daz filed this suit on September 4, 2002 in federal court on behalf of herself and her daughter, alleging that Lyssette's \"IEP was administered inadequately, untimely[,] and contrary to law,\" and that D&#237;az was deprived of her rights to parental involvement and to a timely, fair, and impartial due process hearing. Plaintiffs named as defendants the Commonwealth and the DOE (\"the Commonwealth defendants\"), as well as Rey and R&#237;os (\"the individual defendants\"), who were sued both in their personal capacities and in their official capacities as Secretary of Education of the Commonwealth and Supervisor of the Special Education Program of the Cidra School District, respectively.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> In their initial complaint, plaintiffs asserted against all defendants claims under the IDEA, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, Title II of the ADA, and Puerto Rico law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants answered with a number of affirmative defenses, including that \"[f]ederal policy precludes money damages for IDEA claims\" and that \"[t]he Eleventh Amendment bars [plaintiffs'] claims.\" They also filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the Commonwealth defendants had Eleventh Amendment immunity against the federal law claims, that the federal statutes did not provide for individual liability, and that the district court should decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims. The district court partially granted the motion on December 16, 2003, dismissing the ADA claim for money damages against all defendants and the Rehabilitation Act claim against Rey (then the only individual defendant) in his personal capacity. Plaintiffs did not appeal these rulings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs subsequently amended their complaint. They dropped their ADA claim, kept their claims under the IDEA and Puerto Rico law against all defendants, and reasserted a Rehabilitation Act claim against the Commonwealth defendants only. They sought declaratory relief under 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2201 and 2202; economic and non-economic damages; compensatory and special damages, including damages for \"pain and suffering, emotional distress, humiliation, and the cost of appropriate remedial services, including educational services\"; punitive damages; litigation costs and fees; and \"other and further relief at law or in equity\" as the court deemed proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the suit progressed, defendants took a lackadaisical approach to responding to their discovery obligations and various court orders. In particular, the DOE repeatedly failed to comply with the court's orders to produce the full record from the prior administrative proceedings. Plaintiffs moved to sanction defendants. In due course, the court did sanction defendants by striking their pleadings and entering a default order against them, and it did not relent when defendants sought to remove the default.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is important to be clear about the nature of the default order. The court said that \"[t]his case is going to be tried on default, but it is not the typical default.\" Indeed, unlike other defaults, the court's default order did not result in entry of a liability judgment with only damages to be determined. Rather, the court allowed the case to go to the jury on liability and damages, and permitted plaintiffs to present evidence of both.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Furthermore, the court precluded defendants from introducing any evidence, but did give them some leeway to cross-examine plaintiffs' witnesses and did allow them to make opening and closing statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was tried to a jury over the course of three days beginning October 28, 2004.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Testifying on plaintiffs' behalf were Daz and Lyssette, as well as Marlene Aponte Cabrera, a former DOE ALJ, and Mara del Carmen Warren-Gonzlez, the head of a committee of parents involved in an unrelated class-action suit against the DOE. Defendants made opening and closing statements and cross-examined plaintiffs' witnesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the close of plaintiffs' case, defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a). They made a number of arguments, including that the default was incorrectly entered against them, that there was insufficient evidence that the IEP was inadequate, and that the individual defendants were entitled to qualified immunity. The motion was denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At defendants' request, before closing statements, the court talked to the jury about the default order. It explained to the jury that it had entered a \"default\" against defendants as a sanction against them for failing to produce evidence as ordered, which meant that defendants were \"preclu[ded] from presenting any evidence in the case.\" This sanction, the court said, had \"nothing to do with the merits of the case\" and should not be taken against defendants; rather, the case should be decided \"solely upon the evidence received here in Court and upon the instructions that I give you, not upon the default that was previously entered.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After closing statements, defendants did not object that as a matter of law punitive damages were not available under the IDEA and the Rehabilitation Act, that compensatory relief did not include many of the categories of damages plaintiffs sought, and that no federal cause of action was available in a personal capacity against the individual defendants. The court relied on plaintiffs' representations to the contrary and instructed the jury that punitive and compensatory damages were available against all defendants. The court explained to the jury that compensatory damages \"are damages designed ... to put [a person] in the position [he] would have been [in] had no harm ... taken place,\" and it gave the example of damages for repairs, lost wages, and medical expenses that would be available in a suit based on injuries from a car accident. It then contrasted compensatory damages with punitive damages, which \"are designed to ... punish an actor when [he has] acted with deliberate indifference toward[] the rights of another.\" The court also instructed the jury on the elements of causes of action under the IDEA, the Rehabilitation Act, &#167; 1983, Title II of the ADA, and the Commonwealth law of negligence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants objected to these instructions only on three grounds:<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> (1) that an instruction regarding expert testimony was improper; (2) that compensatory damages were not available under the state law claim, because Puerto Rico's Law 51, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 18, &#167;&#167; 1351-1359, did not explicitly allow for damages; and (3) that because the amended complaint requested damages \"in an amount to be proved at trial,\" and this was a default trial, the only damages available were the $44,000 of economic damages testified to by D&#237;az. Defendants also made one objection to the verdict form: that it was unclear from the form and the court's instructions that the jury need not award punitive damages against both of the individual defendants. The court rejected all of these arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiffs. It assessed compensatory damages against all of the defendants in the amount of $45,000 to Daz and $3000 to Lyssette. The jury also assessed a $100,000 punitive damages award in favor of Lyssette, which was understood to be against the individual defendants in their personal capacities.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judgment was entered on November 9, 2004. On November 24, defendants filed a timely motion renewing their request for judgment as a matter of law, <i>see</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 50(b), and requesting, in the alternative, a new trial or remittitur, <i>see</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 59. In support of their motion, defendants raised a panoply of arguments, some of which had not been articulated after their initial pleadings were struck by the district court and before the jury verdict. In addition to challenging the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury verdict, defendants argued that as a matter of law, none of the statutes pleaded by plaintiffs provided for punitive damages or for the type of compensatory relief plaintiffs sought and were awarded. Defendants also argued that these statutes did not allow the individual defendants to be sued in their personal capacities, and reiterated their argument, presented in their Rule 50(a) motion, that Rey and R&#237;os were protected by qualified immunity. The district court denied defendants' motion, without explanation of reasons, on January 3, 2005.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, on November 23, 2004, plaintiffs filed a motion for declaratory relief, which defendants duly opposed. The court summarily granted plaintiffs' motion in its entirety on January 3, 2005 and summarily rejected on February 7, 2005 defendants' subsequent motion to amend the declaratory judgment order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Challenge to Entry of Default</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue the district court abused its discretion when it refused to set aside the default order against them.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> On plaintiffs' motion, the court had entered default against the DOE, pursuant to Rule 37(b)(2)(C) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, because it repeatedly failed to produce a full and accurate copy of the administrative record, as required by the IDEA, <i>see</i> 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(i)(2)(C)(i) (providing that \"[i]n any [civil] action brought under this paragraph, the court. . . shall receive the records of the administrative proceedings\"), and by the court's discovery orders. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(b)(2)(C) (\"If a party ... fails to obey an order to provide or permit discovery,... the court . . . may make . . . [a]n order striking out pleadings . . . or rendering a judgment by default against the disobedient party[.]\"). In the same order, the court also entered default against the individual defendants on the ground that they failed to comply with discovery rules and other discovery orders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the Commonwealth defendants argue that their failure to provide the administrative record is not a proper ground for default, because the obligation to produce the record is created not by the discovery rules, but by the IDEA, <i>see</i> 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(i)(2)(C)(i), which does not itself specify a timeline for compliance. The Commonwealth defendants also downplay the untimeliness of their responses to the various discovery orders, assert that they did not act in bad faith, note that they did eventually produce the administrative record that was sought in discovery, and decry default as excessively harsh given the circumstances. Finally, the individual defendants argue that, at the very least, sanctions should not have been imposed against them, because the IDEA imposes the obligation to produce administrative records on the DOE, not on them, and because they were timely in responding to plaintiffs' discovery requests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"We review the trial court's imposition and selection of sanctions under [Rule 37(b)] for abuse of discretion....\" <i>Guex v. Allmerica Fin. Life Ins. &amp; Annuity Co.,</i> 146 F.3d 40, 41 (1st Cir.1998) (per curiam); <i>see also KPS &amp; Assocs., Inc. v. Designs By FMC, Inc.,</i> 318 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir.2003). \"There is nothing in [Rule 37(b)] that states or suggests that [any particular sanction] can be used only after all the other sanctions have been considered or tried.\" <i>Damiani v. R.I. Hosp.,</i> 704 F.2d 12, 15 (1st Cir.1983). Therefore, the sanctioned party \"bears a heavy burden of demonstrating that the trial judge was clearly not justified in entering an order of [default] under Rule 37.\" <i>Spiller</i> <i>v. U.S.V. Labs., Inc.,</i> 842 F.2d 535, 537 (1st Cir.1988); <i>see also KPS &amp; Assocs., Inc.,</i> 318 F.3d at 13 (noting that \"the district court, familiar with the parties and circumstances, is best situated to weigh the reasons for and against\" default (quoting <i>Bond Leather Co. v. Q.T. Shoe Mfg. Co.,</i> 764 F.2d 928, 938 (1st Cir.1985)) (internal quotation mark omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the question is close, we uphold the entry of sanctions against all defendants. The Commonwealth defendants' argument that the IDEA does not specify a schedule for the delivery of the administrative record misses the point. What matters is that the district court twice ordered them to produce the record by a certain date and that they failed both times to come into full compliance with the court's order. As to their argument that they did not act in bad faith, Rule 37(b)(2) allows for sanctions \"[i]f a party ... fails to obey an order to provide or permit discovery,\" and nothing in the rule requires that the failure be on account of bad faith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of the defendants violated discovery orders either by missing clearly established deadlines or by representing to the court that they had complied fully with their obligations, even when their submissions (timely or otherwise) were incomplete, vague, or evasive. The court's discovery orders of March 11 and April 27, 2004 explicitly warned defendants that failure to comply fully and on time would result in sanctions, including the striking of pleadings and the entry of default. Under these circumstances, the district court was within its discretion in imposing sanctions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Challenge to the Award of Monetary Relief</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the jury found defendants liable and assessed compensatory damages against all defendants and punitive damages against the individual defendants in their personal capacities. Defendants initially challenged the availability of these damages in their post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law, new trial, or remittitur, which the district court summarily denied. We would usually review the denial of a Rule 50(b) motion de novo and the denial of a Rule 59 motion for abuse of discretion. In this case, however, defendants failed to raise many of the arguments raised in their post-trial motions after their pleadings had been struck and before the jury verdict. We thus review their unpreserved arguments for plain error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 51(d)(2) (\"A court may consider a plain error in the [jury] instructions affecting substantial rights that has not been preserved as required by Rule 51(d)(1)(A) or (B).\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Punitive Damages</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the claims under the Rehabilitation Act against the individual defendants and the claims under Title II of the ADA against all the defendants had been dismissed from the case before trial and no claim under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 had ever been pleaded, purported claims under these statutes were somehow used as a basis for a punitive damages instruction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the final day of trial, before instructing the jury, the district court engaged in a colloquy with the parties regarding the jury instructions and verdict form. When the court raised the question of whether punitive damages were available under the causes of action pleaded, plaintiffs' counsel misrepresented to the court that punitive damages could be awarded against the individual defendants under the Rehabilitation Act, and so were available through the vehicle of &#167; 1983.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> Plaintiffs' counsel did not tell the court that the Supreme Court had held that punitive damages were unavailable under the Rehabilitation Act. <i>See Barnes v. Gorman,</i> 536 U.S. 181, 189, 122 S.Ct. 2097, 153 L.Ed.2d 230 (2002). Defense counsel failed to object that punitive damages were unavailable as a matter of law; failed to remind the court that not only had the Rehabilitation Act claim in the original complaint against Rey in his personal capacity already been dismissed, but also that the amended complaint did not allege a Rehabilitation Act claim against the individual defendants; and failed to alert the court that the &#167; 1983 and Title II claims were never pleaded in the amended complaint.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, the district court instructed the jury on both Title II and &#167; 1983, and further advised the jury that punitive damages were available under federal law,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> so long as defendants' actions involved deliberate indifference toward the rights of another. Defendants did not make any relevant objections to these instructions or to the verdict form. The jury proceeded to award a total of $100,000 in punitive damages to Lyssette against Rey and R&#237;os in their personal capacities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not until their post-verdict motion did defendants argue that punitive damages were unavailable under the pleaded causes of action as a matter of law. The district court issued an order summarily denying their motion, from which they now appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is black letter law that punitive damages&#8212;indeed money damages of any sort&#8212;are not available in a private suit under the IDEA. <i>See Nieves-M&#225;rquez v. Puerto Rico,</i> 353 F.3d 108, 124 (1st Cir.2003) (holding that the only monetary awards available under the IDEA are \"[a]wards of compensatory education and equitable remedies that involve the payment of money, such as reimbursements to parents for expenses incurred on private educational services to which their child was later found to have been entitled\"). Nor are punitive damages available under the Rehabilitation Act. <i>See id.</i> at 126; <i>see also Barnes,</i> 536 U.S. at 189, 122 S.Ct. 2097 (\"[P]unitive damages may not be awarded in ... suits brought under ... &#167; 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.\").

The law is equally clear that no punitive damages are available under that cause of action either. <i>See Barnes,</i> 536 U.S. at 189, 122 S.Ct. 2097; <i>Nieves-M&#225;rquez,</i> 353 F.3d at 126.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs next attempt to recharacterize this case as a &#167; 1983 case and so justify an award of punitive damages.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> We reject the argument and hold that &#167; 1983 cannot be used to escape the strictures on damages under the IDEA, which preclude both punitive damages and general compensatory damages, where the &#167; 1983 claim is premised on a right created by the IDEA. As we observed in <i>Nieves-M&#225;rquez,</i> \"if federal policy precludes money damages for IDEA claims, it would be odd for damages to be available under another vehicle, ... where the underlying claim is one of violation of IDEA.\" 353 F.3d at 125; <i>see also id.</i> at 125-26 (noting that \"[s]everal circuits have barred money damages under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 for IDEA-based claims for precisely this reason\"). After all, plaintiffs cannot circumvent other requirements of the IDEA, such as the requirement to exhaust administrative remedies, <i>see</i> 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(<i>l</i>), merely by pleading under &#167; 1983. <i>See Frazier v. Fairhaven Sch. Comm.,</i> 276 F.3d 52, 60-64 (1st Cir.2002). Allowing plaintiffs to claim money damages under &#167; 1983 \"would subvert ... the overall scheme that Congress envisioned for dealing with educational disabilities,\" <i>id.</i> at 63, as well as the purpose of the IDEA, which simply \"is to ensure FAPE,\" <i>Nieves-M&#225;rquez,</i> 353 F.3d at 125. <i>See also Sellers by Sellers v. Sch.

This text was added as a reaction to the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Smith v. Robinson,</i> 468 U.S. 992, 104 S.Ct. 3457, 82 L.Ed.2d 746 (1984), which held that the predecessor statute to the IDEA was \"the exclusive avenue through which a plaintiff may assert an equal protection claim to a publicly financed special education.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1009, 104 S.Ct. 3457. We read the caveat set out in 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(<i>l</i>) as intended to ensure that the IDEA does not restrict rights and remedies that were already independently available through other sources of law. Situations in which the caveat would be applicable surely exist, but this is not one of them. Plaintiffs' case turns entirely on the rights created by statute in the IDEA. They did not plead a &#167; 1983 action in their complaints, nor did they state a constitutional claim.

Pointing to a provision of the IDEA, which states that the cost of reimbursement \"may be reduced or denied\" in certain circumstances, such as \"upon a judicial finding of unreasonableness with respect to actions taken by the parents,\" 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii), defendants argue that D&#237;az was not entitled to reimbursement because her actions were unreasonable. But the jury verdict and grant of substantial damages confirmed that defendants' proposed IEPs were inadequate and untimely. Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that D&#237;az's decision to enroll Lyssette in a private school was so unreasonable that it was an abuse of discretion to award tuition reimbursement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants' final argument, that D&#237;az is not entitled to prospective relief in the amount of future educational expenses until Lyssette reaches maximum school age, has more bite. As the term \"reimbursement\" suggests, tuition reimbursement is a backward-looking form of remedial relief; \"[r]eimbursement merely requires the [defendant] to belatedly pay expenses that it should have paid all along and would have borne in the first instance had it developed a proper IEP.\" <i>Sch. Comm.,</i> 471 U.S. at 371-72, 105 S.Ct. 1996. It goes without saying that those \"expenses\" must be actual and retrospective, not anticipated. Indeed, this reasoning is at the heart of the distinction, recognized by this court, between \"tuition reimbursement\" and \"compensatory education.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a> <i>See Ms. M. ex rel.

Laws Ann. tit. 32, &#167; 3077, which abrogates the Commonwealth's immunity with respect to negligence suits filed against the Commonwealth in Puerto Rico's Court of the First Instance, does not extend that waiver to suits filed in federal court. <i>See Pennhurst,</i> 465 U.S. at 99 &amp; n. 9, 104 S.Ct. 900 (noting that \"[a] State's constitutional interest in immunity encompasses not merely <i>whether</i> it may be sued, but <i>where</i> it may be sued\").

We have also discussed why the award (to the extent it represents general damages) is not, in any event, viable as a matter of law on those bases. And so we return to what this case is really about&#8212;a claim under the IDEA&#8212;to see if the IDEA authorizes a monetary award against individuals in their personal capacities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs do not even attempt to defend the award of damages against the individuals; they merely assert that compensatory damages are generally available against defendants as a group. We have already held that general compensatory damages are not available at all under the IDEA. We add that the IDEA does not permit an award of <i>any</i> monetary relief, including tuition reimbursement and compensatory education, against individual school officials who are named in their personal capacities as defendants in an IDEA action. As the Eighth Circuit recognized in <i>Bradley v. Arkansas Department of Education,</i> 301 F.3d 952, \"the IDEA is devoid of textual support for ... an award\" of education expenses against individual defendants; \"such expenses would be recoverable [only] from the school district\" (or public agency). <i>Id.</i> at 957 n. 6. Indeed, the plain text of the statute authorizes reimbursement of educational expenses only against the agency, not against any of its officials. <i>See</i> 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii) (\"If the parents of a child with a disability, who previously received special education and related services under the authority of a public agency, enroll the child in a private elementary school or secondary school without the consent of or referral by the public agency, a court or a hearing officer may require <i>the agency</i> to reimburse the parents for the cost of that enrollment if the court or hearing officer finds that the agency had not made a [FAPE] available to the child in a timely manner prior to that enrollment.\" (emphasis added)). That only the public agency is liable for reimbursement follows naturally from the fact that Congress assigned to the agency the ultimate responsibility for ensuring FAPE. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1400(c)(6) (\"States, local educational agencies, and educational service agencies are primarily responsible for providing an education for all children with disabilities....\"); <i>id.</i> &#167; 1401(9)(A) (requiring that FAPE be \"provided at public expense, under public supervision and direction, and without charge\"). No claim for monetary relief can thus be stated against individual defendants under IDEA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves as a possible justification for a monetary award against the individual defendants only the pendent state claims under Law 51, <i>see</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 18, &#167;&#167; 1351-1359, and Puerto Rico's general negligence statute, <i>see</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, &#167;&#167; 5141-5142. It is, in our view, doubtful that Law 51 (even when combined with the general negligence statute) permits private party actions for damages against individuals in their personal capacities, as opposed to suits against individual defendants in their official capacities. <i>Cf. Bonilla v. Chardon,</i> 18 P.R. Offic. Trans. 696, 704, 710-11 (P.R.1987) (allowing for an award of compensatory damages under the general negligence statute for a \"gross\" violation of the predecessor statute to Law 51 against the DOE and its officers in their official capacities). Plaintiffs have simply asserted there is such a claim. We are not inclined to subject individual state officials to personal liability for monetary relief in IDEA analog suits absent a clearer indication from the courts of Puerto Rico that such a claim is available under their law. Federal courts do not engage in wholesale expansion, or indeed creation, of state law theories of action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Effect of Defendants' Failure to Timely Raise Legal Defenses</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs argue that, whatever the legal deficiencies of the punitive and compensatory damages awards, defendants waived any challenge to those awards by failing to object in a timely manner to the jury instructions and verdict form. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 51(b)(2), (c)(2) (stating that a party that has been informed of an instruction before the jury is instructed and before final jury arguments must object to the instruction on the record \"before the instructions and arguments are delivered\"); <i>see also</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 51(d)(1)(A).

Autokirey, Inc.,</i> 379 F.3d 4, 10 (1st Cir.2004) (quoting <i>Smith v. Kmart Corp.,</i> 177 F.3d 19, 26 (1st Cir. 1999); <i>Mu&#241;iz v. Rovira,</i> 373 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.2004)) (some internal quotation marks omitted); <i>see also</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 51 advisory committee's note (listing \"at least\" four factors relevant to a finding of plain error: (1) \"the obviousness of the mistake,\" (2) \"[t]he importance of the error,\" (3) \"[t]he costs of correcting [the] error,\" and (4) \"the impact a verdict may have on nonparties\"). The standard is high, and \"it is rare indeed for a panel to find plain error in a civil case.\" <i>Chestnut,</i> 305 F.3d at 20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The present case is one of those rare occasions when the standard is met. Here, the errors of law were plain: punitive damages and tort-like compensatory damages were not authorized under any of the causes of action alive at the time of trial against any of the defendants. Moreover, the legal errors were clearly prejudicial to defendants: the jury would not have granted the $100,000 punitive damages award and over $30,000 in tort-like compensatory damages had it not been instructed, contrary to law, that such damages were available. Finally, the errors, while compounded by defendants' silence, were in major part created by plaintiffs' active misleading of the court as to the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Allowing the award to stand would be a miscarriage of justice. <i>See id.</i> (reviewing for plain error and vacating a punitive damages award, in part because allowing the award to stand would be a miscarriage of justice); <i>Hurley v. Atl. City Police Dep't,</i> 174 F.3d 95, 123-24 (3d Cir.1999) (same); <i>Williams v. City of New York,</i> 508 F.2d 356, 362 (2d Cir.1974) (vacating punitive damages award against defendant municipality on plain error review because of \"the demonstrable deviation of the court's instruction here from the appropriate standard, the serious harm suffered by the defendant as a result of this error, and the remediability of this error without a new trial below\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is especially so because the windfall of such awards to IDEA plaintiffs would likely come at the expense of other educational benefits for other schoolchildren by diverting from them scarce educational resources. <i>See Chestnut,</i> 305 F.3d at 20-21. The Supreme Court recognized this principle in <i>City of Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc.,</i> 453 U.S. 247, 101 S.Ct. 2748, 69 L.Ed.2d 616 (1981), in which it vacated, on plenary review, an award under &#167; 1983 of punitive damages against a municipality, even though defendants failed to object to the charge at trial, in part because \"punitive damages imposed on a municipality are in effect a windfall to a fully compensated plaintiff, and are likely accompanied by an increase in taxes or a reduction of public services for the citizens footing the bill.\" <i>Id.</i> at 267. The Court also observed that \"[n]either reason nor justice suggests that such retribution should be visited upon the shoulders of blameless or unknowing taxpayers.\" <i>Id.</i> In <i>Chestnut,</i> this court, sitting en banc, vacated damages on plain error review in similar circumstances.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a> <i>See</i> 305 F.3d at 22.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are also influenced by the fact that it would be a miscarriage of justice to allow an award to stand, where that award was brought about by plaintiffs' misleading the court about the law. <i>See id.</i> at 20 (finding a \"miscarriage of justice\" where \"[p]laintiff's counsel, quite erroneously, represented to the district court at the charge conference that punitive damages were permissible against a municipality\"). Had plaintiffs not misled the court as to the law and defendants not stood silent, we doubt the jury would ever have been asked to award punitive damages. Counsel have a duty to be candid about the law, and the trial court, bearing a heavy caseload, relies on counsel to meet that duty. Given the press of work, our trial court system would break down if the court had to stop and independently research every point of law on which counsel appear to agree or, at least, not to disagree. The situation here is especially egregious because the district court explicitly asked whether punitive damages were available and gave both parties an opportunity to respond.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, to let this award stand would contravene Congress's intent as expressed in the IDEA. In choosing not to authorize tort-like monetary damages or punitive damages in cases under the IDEA, Congress made a balanced judgment that such damages would be an unjustified remedy for this statutorily created cause of action. No doubt Congress had in mind that public elementary and secondary education have access to only limited resources and that a sizeable damages award would divert resources to litigants and away from direct expenditure on education. In this case, the public interest in not sustaining the award outweighs the public interest in a smoothly functioning judicial system, which generally requires parties to state their defenses or lose them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants should take little comfort in this outcome. A continuing pattern of poor advocacy by the Commonwealth in IDEA cases could lead to the balance tipping the other way in future cases. One understands the palpable frustration of the trial judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the monetary relief authorized by law, we cannot know whether the jury would have awarded any damages to plaintiffs had defendants not been precluded from presenting evidence as a result of the default order. Perhaps defendants would have won on liability. We leave in place the monetary relief awarded by the jury that was available under the law and remand to the district court for such adjustments as are appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">IV.</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Challenge to the Grant of Declaratory Relief</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn to defendants' final challenge, which is to the declaratory judgment entered by the district court, which effectively also encompassed declaratory relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their amended complaint, plaintiffs requested only that the court \"[d]eclar[e] the defendants to be in violation of the IDEA, the Rehabilitation Act, Law 51, and the Puerto Rico Constitution,\" pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2201, and that it grant \"further necessary and proper relief as provided for under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2202.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem arises because after the trial, in a motion, plaintiffs asked for more extensive and specific declaratory and injunctive relief,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a> in the form of the following five items:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) [T]he reinstatement of Lyssette Cardona Daz with respect to prospective receipt of benefits to which she is entitled as a physically disabled student under... the Rehabilitation Act ... and the [IDEA].

The provision of these benefits should continue until [Lyssette] reaches the maximum public school age.

Specifically, as ancillary relief to this declaration, the plaintiffs request that the Court order reimbursement of $3,298.24 for school year 2003-2004; and $1,220.00 paid as of October[] 2004 for [the] 2004-2005 school year, for a total of <i>$4,518.24</i> to be reimbursed by defendant Department of Education.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) [A] declaration that the defendants' system of hiring administrative law judges under the auspices of the Department of Education is illegal and violative of the pertinent provisions of the [IDEA], which requires that said judges not be employees of a regulated body and instead be independent.

The court then denied on February 7, 2005 defendants' motion to reconsider, alter, or amend that order. The court backed up its order with threats of contempt and monetary sanctions for non-compliance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with defendants that the district court abused its discretion in granting the order and reverse and vacate the declaratory judgment in its entirety.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Relevant Law</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2201-2202 . . . , empowers a federal court to grant declaratory relief in a case of actual controversy.\" <i>Ernst &amp; Young v. Depositors Econ. Protection Corp.,</i> 45 F.3d 530, 534 (1st Cir.1995). The Act \"neither imposes an unflagging duty upon the courts to decide declaratory judgment actions nor grants an entitlement to litigants to demand declaratory remedies.\" <i>El Dia, Inc. v. Hernandez Colon,</i> 963 F.2d 488, 493 (1st Cir.1992). \"Consequently, federal courts retain substantial discretion in deciding whether to grant declaratory relief.\" <i>Ernst &amp; Young,</i> 45 F.3d at 534.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the district court's exercise of its decision to grant declaratory relief \"is conducted under a standard slightly more rigorous than abuse of discretion.\" <i>Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Providence &amp; Worcester R.R.

Ultimately, \"we cede some deference to the trier, especially as to findings of fact, but we will not hesitate to act upon our independent judgment if it appears that a mistake has been made.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some of the declaratory relief is particular to plaintiffs. Much of it is far broader and intended to effectuate what is essentially class-wide relief. This case has never been styled as a class action, no class has ever been certified, and there is no evidence on which such broad relief can be justified. Further, the request for these specific items of declaratory relief was made at the last minute, and defendants were not on notice during the trial that such relief would be sought. From these facts alone, the declaratory relief must be vacated. Still, we go on to deal with the other problems with each portion of the order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Items 1 and 2</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with the first two items of relief set forth in the declaratory judgment order. The first item requires defendants to provide Lyssette with an array of benefits to which she claims to be entitled under the IDEA and the Rehabilitation Act through maximum school age and at public expense. The second declaration is that D&#237;az was fully compliant with the IDEA when she unilaterally enrolled Lyssette in private school and is thus entitled to reimbursement of educational expenses totaling $4518.24, pursuant to 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the first item of declaratory relief, defendants reiterate their objection that plaintiffs are at most entitled to reimbursement of expenses, not to prospective relief under the IDEA and the Rehabilitation Act. Plaintiffs do not respond to defendants' argument; instead, they rehash the ways in which defendants violated plaintiffs' procedural rights under the IDEA. We have already explained why plaintiffs are entitled only to reimbursement for actual expenses incurred, not anticipated expenditures for services for which plaintiffs have yet to pay.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a> <i>Cf. Emery v. Roanoke City Sch. Bd.,</i> 432 F.3d 294, 299 (4th Cir.2005) (holding that \"[s]tanding doctrine requires that reimbursement [under the IDEA] should flow only to those who actually . . . incurred the expense and suffered the subsequent monetary injury\" and therefore that student lacked standing to seek reimbursement, where his father's insurance covered the expenses and \"he suffered no out-of-pocket loss himself\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the second item of declaratory relief, defendants argue that it impermissibly duplicated relief that was already granted by the jury. Plaintiffs again do not respond to defendants' argument; they reiterate only that the declaration is warranted in light of the record. We agree with defendants that the declaration is redundant and that the ancillary monetary relief amounts to impermissible double recovery. <i>Cf. Ponce v. Ashford Presbyterian Cmty. Hosp.,</i> 238 F.3d 20, 22, 25 (1st Cir. 2001) (declining to consider the sufficiency of the evidence in a case in which \"the jury's award [was] redundant with plaintiffs' prior settlement and hence constitute[d] an impermissible double-recovery\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is this item of relief any less redundant in light of the outcome of this appeal. Although we reversed and vacated all other compensatory damages, we let stand the award of reimbursement for the educational expenses D&#237;az actually incurred, including tuition for the 2003-2004 and 2004-2005 school years. While \"[t]he existence of another adequate remedy does not preclude a judgment for declaratory relief in cases where it is appropriate,\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 57, plaintiffs are not entitled to use the declaratory judgment device as an instrument to double their recovery, in the absence of any authority allowing for double damages. <i>See, e.g., Pate v. Nat'l Fund Raising Consultants, Inc.,</i> 20 F.3d 341, 345-46 (8th Cir.1994) (reversing declaratory judgment on the ground that it was \"an impermissible `double recovery' because the court already entered judgment on a jury verdict for actual damages\"). We thus reverse and vacate the first and second items in the declaratory judgment order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Items 3 and 4</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next two declarations are that defendants' systems of (1) hiring ALJs and (2) \"parental involvement in the IEP process and ... keeping minutes and maintaining appropriate, complete administrative records\" are in violation of the IDEA. Defendants' core objection is that these declarations, in denouncing the whole system of special education, go beyond the bounds of the complaint and the evidence in this case. We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These declarations have potentially far-reaching effects on the special education system in Puerto Rico, as well as on the administrative law system there and beyond. The Supreme Court has \"cautioned against declaratory judgments on issues of public moment, even falling short of constitutionality, in speculative situations.\" <i>Pub. Affairs Assocs., Inc. v. Rickover,</i> 369 U.S. 111, 112, 82 S.Ct. 580, 7 L.Ed.2d 604 (1962) (per curiam) (citing <i>Eccles v. Peoples Bank,</i> 333 U.S. 426, 432, 68 S.Ct. 641, 92 L.Ed. 784 (1948)); <i>see also Ernst &amp; Young,</i> 45 F.3d at 535 (noting that a court's \"discretion to grant declaratory relief is to be exercised with great circumspection when matters of public moment are involved\"). Here, the declarations do not meet the test that \"the need [for such pronouncements be] clear, not remote or speculative.\" <i>El Dia, Inc.,</i> 963 F.2d at 494 (quoting <i>Wash. Pub. Power Supply Sys. v. Pac. Nw. Power Co.,</i> 332 F.2d 87, 88 (9th Cir.1964)); <i>see also Eccles,</i> 333 U.S. at 431, 68 S.Ct. 641. Further, the declarations violate the usual rule that the scope of declaratory relief cannot exceed the issues raised by the pleadings and supported by the evidence. <i>See</i> 10B Wright et al., <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> &#167; 2768, at 669 (3d ed.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Item 3</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The declaration that defendants' system for hiring ALJs violates the IDEA exceeds the scope of the allegations in the amended complaint, as well as the evidence presented at trial. The amended complaint alleged only the following with respect to the administrative proceedings: that Daz's administrative complaint \"was left aside without resolution in excess of the 45 days established for those proceedings\" and that \"plaintiffs were denied a fair administrative hearing conducted by an impartial hearing officer.\" The amended complaint made no mention of the system of hiring ALJs; nor did it state any connection between that system and the DOE's alleged failure to provide plaintiffs with a fair and timely resolution of their claims before the agency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence presented at trial was similarly inconclusive. Plaintiffs called to the stand Marlene Aponte Cabrera, a former ALJ with the DOE who had been terminated after a half-year of service. Aponte had no direct involvement in plaintiffs' administrative proceedings, but was allowed to testify to, in the district court's words, \"the way they handled things there, at the [DOE].\" Over defendants' hearsay and relevance objections, plaintiffs elicited testimony from Aponte that she personally did not feel independent in her judgments; that she \"was called upon some of [her] decisions\"; and that \"there were meetings,\" convened by certain DOE officials,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a> in which her \"decision[s] and [those] of other judges [were] discussed.\" Aponte also testified that less than twenty-four hours after a meeting in which Sonia Rosario, head of the special education section of the DOE, questioned Aponte about two of her recent decisions,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a> her contract with the DOE was rescinded.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aponte's testimony, even if true, does not support a broad declaration pronouncing the entire system of hiring ALJs in violation of the IDEA. Other than confirming that she signed a written contract with the DOE, Aponte did not even testify about the DOE's hiring practices for hearing officers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs rely primarily on what they allege are the terms of a written contract of employment between the DOE and hearing officers to argue that the declaration was proper. The contract itself was not admitted into evidence during Aponte's testimony; the record citations plaintiffs provide are not to the contract or to any document that would support their allegations; and, to the extent that the contract is buried somewhere within the administrative record and the fifteen volumes of appendices the parties have submitted to this court, it is plaintiffs' responsibility to direct the court's attention to it. Since the third item of declaratory relief is devoid of evidentiary support, the district court abused its discretion in granting it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Item 4</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For related reasons, the district court abused its discretion in entering the fourth item of declaratory relief, which declares Puerto Rico's systems of \"parental involvement in the IEP process[,] ... keeping minutes[,] and maintaining appropriate, complete administrative records\" in violation of the IDEA. The jury verdict established that defendants failed <i>in this case</i> to involve the parent in the IEP process and to maintain complete administrative records.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a> The amended complaint does not allege, and the evidence at trial did not show, that the failures are systemic. <i>See St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Lawson Bros. Iron Works,</i> 428 F.2d 929, 931 (10th Cir.1970) (\"The judgment in a suit for declaratory judgment must be responsive to the pleadings and issues presented[,] and . . . a judgment which goes beyond the issues presented constitutes an advisory opinion upon a hypothetical basis, which the court cannot give.\" (citing <i>Bus. Men's Assurance Co. v. Sainsbury,</i> 110 F.2d 995 (10th Cir.1940))). Plaintiffs represent no one but themselves, and they are not entitled to relief that goes beyond the scope of what is necessary to remedy the harms caused to them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. <i>Item 5</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fifth and final item of declaratory relief states that \"defendants' system of provision of physical therapy without the referral or prescription of a medical doctor violates Puerto Rico law.\" <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 20, &#167; 241(2) (defining a physical therapist as \"[a] professional ... who applies physiotherapy or physical therapy following the diagnosis and prescription or the referral of a physician\"). The item goes beyond a mere declaration to require defendants to come into compliance with Puerto Rico law, \"impos[ing] a daily accruing fine ... [for] fail[ure] to comply ... in a timely fashion.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Apart from the lack of evidence in the record on which any such relief could be granted, the declaration suffers from an even more serious infirmity: it is contrary to the Eleventh Amendment. While <i>Ex Parte Young,</i> 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908), permits injunctive relief based on federal constitutional claims, it does not allow injunctive relief against state officials for violation of <i>state law,</i> which is the issue here. <i>See id.</i> at 155-56. In this situation, the Eleventh Amendment bar still holds, because \"[a] federal court's grant of relief against state officials on the basis of state law, whether prospective or retroactive, does not vindicate the supreme authority of federal law.\" <i>Pennhurst,</i> 465 U.S. at 106, 104 S.Ct. 900. As the Court noted in <i>Pennhurst,</i> \"it is difficult to think of a greater intrusion on state sovereignty than when a federal court instructs state officials on how to conform their conduct to state law.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fifth declaration plainly runs afoul of <i>Pennhurst.</i> The declaration not only requires the federal court to make pronouncements on the lawfulness of the Commonwealth and its officials' conduct with respect to the Commonwealth's own law, but also has the effect of permitting a federal court to direct Commonwealth officials to comply with that law. <i>See O'Brien v. Mass. Bay Transp. Auth.,</i> 162 F.3d 40, 44 (1st Cir.1998) (\"It is not the proper purview of a federal court to supervise state officials' compliance with state law.\"); <i>see also Cuesnongle v. Ramos,</i> 835 F.2d 1486, 1496-98 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' sole response is a non sequitur.

No punitive damages may be awarded in such a suit, regardless of which of the causes of action listed above is invoked.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. No general compensatory damages may be awarded in such a suit, regardless of which of the causes of action listed above is invoked.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Monetary recovery in such suits is limited to compensatory education and equitable remedies that involve the payment of money, such as reimbursements for educational expenses that would have been borne by defendants in the first instance had they properly developed and implemented an IEP. Under the category of \"reimbursement,\" parents may recover only actual, not anticipated, expenditures for private tuition and related services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. No claim for monetary relief is stated in such cases against individual school administrators who are sued in their personal capacities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">6. A state, here the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, may waive Eleventh Amendment immunity from monetary liability as to IDEA and Rehabilitation Act claims in federal court by accepting federal funds. This does not mean that the state has waived its immunity as to pendent state law claims being heard in federal court. Here, although the Commonwealth waived its immunity from suit in federal court on the federal claims, it did not waive its immunity from suit in federal court on the pendent state law claims under Law 51, <i>see</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 18, &#167;&#167; 1351-1359, and Puerto Rico's general negligence statute, <i>see</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, &#167;&#167; 5141-5142.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying these principles, we conclude that the harm to the public interest requires that we reverse and vacate the entirety of the punitive damages award and all compensatory damages against Rey and R&#237;os in their personal capacities. We also vacate those portions of the compensatory damages award against the Commonwealth that are not available as monetary relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Frustrated with the defendants' many defalcations in this case, the district court also granted in full plaintiffs' belated request for injunctive and declaratory relief. We reverse and vacate the entirety of the declaratory and injunctive relief awarded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no reason to detail the many facts and procedural events in this case and every reason to avoid a focus on the irrelevant. The crux of the dispute is that while the parties agreed that Lyssette could not engage in ordinary physical education and thus needed adaptive physical education, they could not agree over what type of adaptive physical education was appropriate. The public schools lacked swimming pools and declined to pay for swim lessons. D&#237;az insisted that her daughter needed such lessons and that the schools should have to pay for them, as well as for transportation to and from school and for the psychiatric treatment Lyssette required after she became depressed because she could not engage in physical education with her classmates. Feeling frustrated that Lyssette was not receiving any adaptive physical education and that the defendants had engaged in a classic bureaucratic runaround, D&#237;az unilaterally removed Lyssette from public school in 2003 and placed her in a private school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time the litigation began in September 2002, Lyssette was an eleven-year-old public school student. She had been diagnosed in February 2001 with spina bifida and Klippel-Feil Syndrome, as a result of which she suffers from certain physical limitations, such as a circumscribed range of motion in the neck and cervical spine. In August 2001, after a physician recommended that Lyssette refrain from further participation in traditional physical education classes, D&#237;az registered Lyssette in the special education program administered by the DOE<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and requested that Lyssette be provided with specially designed physical education services. <i>See</i> 34 C.F.R. &#167; 300.307(a) (\"Physical education services, specially designed if necessary, must be made available to every child with a disability receiving FAPE.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 4, 2001, the DOE convened a meeting with D&#237;az and other members of Lyssette's IEP team, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 300.16 (defining \"IEP team\" as \"a group of individuals . . . that is responsible for developing, reviewing, or revising an IEP for a child with a disability\"); <i>see also id.</i> &#167; 300.344 (specifying the composition of IEP teams), to produce an IEP for Lyssette. Their deliberations resulted in an IEP for the 2001-2002 school year; this IEP did not provide for special physical education services&#8212;specifically, swim classes, which, plaintiffs have maintained, was the only sport Lyssette could safely practice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The DOE told D&#237;az that it could not provide swim instruction because it did not have any schools equipped with a pool, and that D&#237;az would have to pay out-of-pocket for private swim lessons elsewhere.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D&#237;az filed an administrative complaint with the Commonwealth's DOE on November 27, 2001, requesting that it provide Lyssette with publicly funded swim classes. An administrative law judge (ALJ) eventually found that the DOE did not have the obligation to offer Lyssette swim lessons, because it was not clear from the IEP that swimming was the most appropriate physical education alternative for Lyssette. The ALJ did, however, order that Lyssette receive physical education at the same frequency as her non-disabled classmates, and further directed the parties to meet again to determine, with the help of a specialist, whether swimming was the most appropriate physical education alternative for Lyssette. That order was not handed down until June 14, 2002, far beyond the forty-five days provided by the regulations for resolution of an administrative complaint. <i>See</i> 34 C.F.R. &#167; 300.511(a)(1) (\"The public agency shall ensure that not later than 45 days after the receipt of a request for a hearing... [a] final decision is reached in the hearing....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several unsuccessful attempts to convene an IEP meeting followed; each meeting was cancelled by someone from the school or the DOE. In the end, Lyssette did not receive a revised IEP for her sixth-grade year, which was the 2002-2003 school year; rather, with D&#237;az's permission, Lyssette spent time with her Spanish teacher while her classmates were in physical education class.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 2003, the IEP team convened to create a revised IEP for the 2003-2004 school year. At that meeting, co-defendant R&#237;os told D&#237;az that she had been instructed to inform D&#237;az that they were not going to develop a new IEP for Lyssette. D&#237;az testified that R&#237;os refused to take minutes of the meeting and that R&#237;os and the other school personnel present abruptly ended the meeting when D&#237;az attempted to record the proceedings. No revised IEP was produced and agreed upon by the IEP team for the 2003-2004 school year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lyssette graduated from sixth grade in June 2003, which meant that she had to transfer to a middle school. In July of that year, D&#237;az met with DOE and school officials to discuss Lyssette's placement options for the following year. D&#237;az requested that her daughter be enrolled in the Dejas School, because of that school's proximity to Lyssette's grandmother's house and the Puerto Rican Medical Center, where Lyssette's neurosurgeon and orthopedic surgeon practiced. The DOE, however, notified D&#237;az that the school of her choice was not available; that the normal placement procedures for regular-education students applied to Lyssette; and that under those procedures, Lyssette could not enroll in the Dejas School, but instead must choose from two schools closer in proximity to her home. The topic of physical education was not raised during this meeting and was not mentioned as a criterion for D&#237;az's choice of schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D&#237;az then informed the DOE that its proffered options were not acceptable and that she would be withdrawing Lyssette from public school and placing her in private school during the 2003-2004 school year at public cost. Lyssette was eventually enrolled in a private school close to her grandmother's home; that school was equipped with a swimming pool, but, according to D&#237;az, Lyssette did not take swim lessons there because physical education was not a part of the regular curriculum and extracurricular lessons were prohibitively expensive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The DOE initiated a second administrative proceeding in July 2003, challenging Lyssette's placement in the private school. That proceeding was resolved in the DOE's favor on December 10, 2003, which was apparently also in excess of the forty-five-day deadline imposed by the regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the interim, Daz filed this suit on September 4, 2002 in federal court on behalf of herself and her daughter, alleging that Lyssette's \"IEP was administered inadequately, untimely[,] and contrary to law,\" and that D&#237;az was deprived of her rights to parental involvement and to a timely, fair, and impartial due process hearing. Plaintiffs named as defendants the Commonwealth and the DOE (\"the Commonwealth defendants\"), as well as Rey and R&#237;os (\"the individual defendants\"), who were sued both in their personal capacities and in their official capacities as Secretary of Education of the Commonwealth and Supervisor of the Special Education Program of the Cidra School District, respectively.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> In their initial complaint, plaintiffs asserted against all defendants claims under the IDEA, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, Title II of the ADA, and Puerto Rico law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants answered with a number of affirmative defenses, including that \"[f]ederal policy precludes money damages for IDEA claims\" and that \"[t]he Eleventh Amendment bars [plaintiffs'] claims.\" They also filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the Commonwealth defendants had Eleventh Amendment immunity against the federal law claims, that the federal statutes did not provide for individual liability, and that the district court should decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims. The district court partially granted the motion on December 16, 2003, dismissing the ADA claim for money damages against all defendants and the Rehabilitation Act claim against Rey (then the only individual defendant) in his personal capacity. Plaintiffs did not appeal these rulings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs subsequently amended their complaint. They dropped their ADA claim, kept their claims under the IDEA and Puerto Rico law against all defendants, and reasserted a Rehabilitation Act claim against the Commonwealth defendants only. They sought declaratory relief under 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2201 and 2202; economic and non-economic damages; compensatory and special damages, including damages for \"pain and suffering, emotional distress, humiliation, and the cost of appropriate remedial services, including educational services\"; punitive damages; litigation costs and fees; and \"other and further relief at law or in equity\" as the court deemed proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the suit progressed, defendants took a lackadaisical approach to responding to their discovery obligations and various court orders. In particular, the DOE repeatedly failed to comply with the court's orders to produce the full record from the prior administrative proceedings. Plaintiffs moved to sanction defendants. In due course, the court did sanction defendants by striking their pleadings and entering a default order against them, and it did not relent when defendants sought to remove the default.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is important to be clear about the nature of the default order. The court said that \"[t]his case is going to be tried on default, but it is not the typical default.\" Indeed, unlike other defaults, the court's default order did not result in entry of a liability judgment with only damages to be determined. Rather, the court allowed the case to go to the jury on liability and damages, and permitted plaintiffs to present evidence of both.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Furthermore, the court precluded defendants from introducing any evidence, but did give them some leeway to cross-examine plaintiffs' witnesses and did allow them to make opening and closing statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was tried to a jury over the course of three days beginning October 28, 2004.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Testifying on plaintiffs' behalf were Daz and Lyssette, as well as Marlene Aponte Cabrera, a former DOE ALJ, and Mara del Carmen Warren-Gonzlez, the head of a committee of parents involved in an unrelated class-action suit against the DOE. Defendants made opening and closing statements and cross-examined plaintiffs' witnesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the close of plaintiffs' case, defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a). They made a number of arguments, including that the default was incorrectly entered against them, that there was insufficient evidence that the IEP was inadequate, and that the individual defendants were entitled to qualified immunity. The motion was denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At defendants' request, before closing statements, the court talked to the jury about the default order. It explained to the jury that it had entered a \"default\" against defendants as a sanction against them for failing to produce evidence as ordered, which meant that defendants were \"preclu[ded] from presenting any evidence in the case.\" This sanction, the court said, had \"nothing to do with the merits of the case\" and should not be taken against defendants; rather, the case should be decided \"solely upon the evidence received here in Court and upon the instructions that I give you, not upon the default that was previously entered.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After closing statements, defendants did not object that as a matter of law punitive damages were not available under the IDEA and the Rehabilitation Act, that compensatory relief did not include many of the categories of damages plaintiffs sought, and that no federal cause of action was available in a personal capacity against the individual defendants. The court relied on plaintiffs' representations to the contrary and instructed the jury that punitive and compensatory damages were available against all defendants. The court explained to the jury that compensatory damages \"are damages designed ... to put [a person] in the position [he] would have been [in] had no harm ... taken place,\" and it gave the example of damages for repairs, lost wages, and medical expenses that would be available in a suit based on injuries from a car accident. It then contrasted compensatory damages with punitive damages, which \"are designed to ... punish an actor when [he has] acted with deliberate indifference toward[] the rights of another.\" The court also instructed the jury on the elements of causes of action under the IDEA, the Rehabilitation Act, &#167; 1983, Title II of the ADA, and the Commonwealth law of negligence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants objected to these instructions only on three grounds:<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> (1) that an instruction regarding expert testimony was improper; (2) that compensatory damages were not available under the state law claim, because Puerto Rico's Law 51, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 18, &#167;&#167; 1351-1359, did not explicitly allow for damages; and (3) that because the amended complaint requested damages \"in an amount to be proved at trial,\" and this was a default trial, the only damages available were the $44,000 of economic damages testified to by D&#237;az. Defendants also made one objection to the verdict form: that it was unclear from the form and the court's instructions that the jury need not award punitive damages against both of the individual defendants. The court rejected all of these arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiffs. It assessed compensatory damages against all of the defendants in the amount of $45,000 to Daz and $3000 to Lyssette. The jury also assessed a $100,000 punitive damages award in favor of Lyssette, which was understood to be against the individual defendants in their personal capacities.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judgment was entered on November 9, 2004. On November 24, defendants filed a timely motion renewing their request for judgment as a matter of law, <i>see</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 50(b), and requesting, in the alternative, a new trial or remittitur, <i>see</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 59. In support of their motion, defendants raised a panoply of arguments, some of which had not been articulated after their initial pleadings were struck by the district court and before the jury verdict. In addition to challenging the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury verdict, defendants argued that as a matter of law, none of the statutes pleaded by plaintiffs provided for punitive damages or for the type of compensatory relief plaintiffs sought and were awarded. Defendants also argued that these statutes did not allow the individual defendants to be sued in their personal capacities, and reiterated their argument, presented in their Rule 50(a) motion, that Rey and R&#237;os were protected by qualified immunity. The district court denied defendants' motion, without explanation of reasons, on January 3, 2005.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, on November 23, 2004, plaintiffs filed a motion for declaratory relief, which defendants duly opposed. The court summarily granted plaintiffs' motion in its entirety on January 3, 2005 and summarily rejected on February 7, 2005 defendants' subsequent motion to amend the declaratory judgment order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Challenge to Entry of Default</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue the district court abused its discretion when it refused to set aside the default order against them.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> On plaintiffs' motion, the court had entered default against the DOE, pursuant to Rule 37(b)(2)(C) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, because it repeatedly failed to produce a full and accurate copy of the administrative record, as required by the IDEA, <i>see</i> 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(i)(2)(C)(i) (providing that \"[i]n any [civil] action brought under this paragraph, the court. . . shall receive the records of the administrative proceedings\"), and by the court's discovery orders. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(b)(2)(C) (\"If a party ... fails to obey an order to provide or permit discovery,... the court . . . may make . . . [a]n order striking out pleadings . . . or rendering a judgment by default against the disobedient party[.]\"). In the same order, the court also entered default against the individual defendants on the ground that they failed to comply with discovery rules and other discovery orders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the Commonwealth defendants argue that their failure to provide the administrative record is not a proper ground for default, because the obligation to produce the record is created not by the discovery rules, but by the IDEA, <i>see</i> 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(i)(2)(C)(i), which does not itself specify a timeline for compliance. The Commonwealth defendants also downplay the untimeliness of their responses to the various discovery orders, assert that they did not act in bad faith, note that they did eventually produce the administrative record that was sought in discovery, and decry default as excessively harsh given the circumstances. Finally, the individual defendants argue that, at the very least, sanctions should not have been imposed against them, because the IDEA imposes the obligation to produce administrative records on the DOE, not on them, and because they were timely in responding to plaintiffs' discovery requests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"We review the trial court's imposition and selection of sanctions under [Rule 37(b)] for abuse of discretion....\" <i>Guex v.

The Commonwealth defendants' argument that the IDEA does not specify a schedule for the delivery of the administrative record misses the point. What matters is that the district court twice ordered them to produce the record by a certain date and that they failed both times to come into full compliance with the court's order. As to their argument that they did not act in bad faith, Rule 37(b)(2) allows for sanctions \"[i]f a party ... fails to obey an order to provide or permit discovery,\" and nothing in the rule requires that the failure be on account of bad faith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of the defendants violated discovery orders either by missing clearly established deadlines or by representing to the court that they had complied fully with their obligations, even when their submissions (timely or otherwise) were incomplete, vague, or evasive. The court's discovery orders of March 11 and April 27, 2004 explicitly warned defendants that failure to comply fully and on time would result in sanctions, including the striking of pleadings and the entry of default. Under these circumstances, the district court was within its discretion in imposing sanctions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Challenge to the Award of Monetary Relief</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the jury found defendants liable and assessed compensatory damages against all defendants and punitive damages against the individual defendants in their personal capacities. Defendants initially challenged the availability of these damages in their post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law, new trial, or remittitur, which the district court summarily denied. We would usually review the denial of a Rule 50(b) motion de novo and the denial of a Rule 59 motion for abuse of discretion.

But the jury verdict and grant of substantial damages confirmed that defendants' proposed IEPs were inadequate and untimely.

We have also discussed why the award (to the extent it represents general damages) is not, in any event, viable as a matter of law on those bases.

We have already held that general compensatory damages are not available at all under the IDEA. We add that the IDEA does not permit an award of <i>any</i> monetary relief, including tuition reimbursement and compensatory education, against individual school officials who are named in their personal capacities as defendants in an IDEA action. As the Eighth Circuit recognized in <i>Bradley v. Arkansas Department of Education,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778947\"><a href=\"/opinion/778947/marcia-harding-in-her-official-capacity-as-acting-associate-director/\"><span class=\"volume\">301</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">952</span></a></span>, \"the IDEA is devoid of textual support for ... an award\" of education expenses against individual defendants; \"such expenses would be recoverable [only] from the school district\" (or public agency). <i>Id.</i> at 957 n. 6. Indeed, the plain text of the statute authorizes reimbursement of educational expenses only against the agency, not against any of its officials. <i>See</i> 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii) (\"If the parents of a child with a disability, who previously received special education and related services under the authority of a public agency, enroll the child in a private elementary school or secondary school without the consent of or referral by the public agency, a court or a hearing officer may require <i>the agency</i> to reimburse the parents for the cost of that enrollment if the court or hearing officer finds that the agency had not made a [FAPE] available to the child in a timely manner prior to that enrollment.\" (emphasis added)). That only the public agency is liable for reimbursement follows naturally from the fact that Congress assigned to the agency the ultimate responsibility for ensuring FAPE. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1400(c)(6) (\"States, local educational agencies, and educational service agencies are primarily responsible for providing an education for all children with disabilities....\"); <i>id.</i> &#167; 1401(9)(A) (requiring that FAPE be \"provided at public expense, under public supervision and direction, and without charge\").

It is, in our view, doubtful that Law 51 (even when combined with the general negligence statute) permits private party actions for damages against individuals in their personal capacities, as opposed to suits against individual defendants in their official capacities. <i>Cf.

Plaintiffs have simply asserted there is such a claim. We are not inclined to subject individual state officials to personal liability for monetary relief in IDEA analog suits absent a clearer indication from the courts of Puerto Rico that such a claim is available under their law.

Had plaintiffs not misled the court as to the law and defendants not stood silent, we doubt the jury would ever have been asked to award punitive damages. Counsel have a duty to be candid about the law, and the trial court, bearing a heavy caseload, relies on counsel to meet that duty. Given the press of work, our trial court system would break down if the court had to stop and independently research every point of law on which counsel appear to agree or, at least, not to disagree. The situation here is especially egregious because the district court explicitly asked whether punitive damages were available and gave both parties an opportunity to respond.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, to let this award stand would contravene Congress's intent as expressed in the IDEA. In choosing not to authorize tort-like monetary damages or punitive damages in cases under the IDEA, Congress made a balanced judgment that such damages would be an unjustified remedy for this statutorily created cause of action. No doubt Congress had in mind that public elementary and secondary education have access to only limited resources and that a sizeable damages award would divert resources to litigants and away from direct expenditure on education. In this case, the public interest in not sustaining the award outweighs the public interest in a smoothly functioning judicial system, which generally requires parties to state their defenses or lose them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants should take little comfort in this outcome.

Much of it is far broader and intended to effectuate what is essentially class-wide relief. This case has never been styled as a class action, no class has ever been certified, and there is no evidence on which such broad relief can be justified. Further, the request for these specific items of declaratory relief was made at the last minute, and defendants were not on notice during the trial that such relief would be sought. From these facts alone, the declaratory relief must be vacated. Still, we go on to deal with the other problems with each portion of the order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Items 1 and 2</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with the first two items of relief set forth in the declaratory judgment order. The first item requires defendants to provide Lyssette with an array of benefits to which she claims to be entitled under the IDEA and the Rehabilitation Act through maximum school age and at public expense. The second declaration is that D&#237;az was fully compliant with the IDEA when she unilaterally enrolled Lyssette in private school and is thus entitled to reimbursement of educational expenses totaling $4518.24, pursuant to 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the first item of declaratory relief, defendants reiterate their objection that plaintiffs are at most entitled to reimbursement of expenses, not to prospective relief under the IDEA and the Rehabilitation Act. Plaintiffs do not respond to defendants' argument; instead, they rehash the ways in which defendants violated plaintiffs' procedural rights under the IDEA. We have already explained why plaintiffs are entitled only to reimbursement for actual expenses incurred, not anticipated expenditures for services for which plaintiffs have yet to pay.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a> <i>Cf. Emery v. Roanoke City Sch. Bd.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></span>, 299 (4th Cir.2005) (holding that \"[s]tanding doctrine requires that reimbursement [under the IDEA] should flow only to those who actually . . . incurred the expense and suffered the subsequent monetary injury\" and therefore that student lacked standing to seek reimbursement, where his father's insurance covered the expenses and \"he suffered no out-of-pocket loss himself\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the second item of declaratory relief, defendants argue that it impermissibly duplicated relief that was already granted by the jury. Plaintiffs again do not respond to defendants' argument; they reiterate only that the declaration is warranted in light of the record. We agree with defendants that the declaration is redundant and that the ancillary monetary relief amounts to impermissible double recovery. <i>Cf. Ponce v. Ashford Presbyterian Cmty. Hosp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199238\"><a href=\"/opinion/199238/alicea-ponce-v-santiago/\"><span class=\"volume\">238</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 22, 25 (1st Cir. 2001) (declining to consider the sufficiency of the evidence in a case in which \"the jury's award [was] redundant with plaintiffs' prior settlement and hence constitute[d] an impermissible double-recovery\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is this item of relief any less redundant in light of the outcome of this appeal. Although we reversed and vacated all other compensatory damages, we let stand the award of reimbursement for the educational expenses D&#237;az actually incurred, including tuition for the 2003-2004 and 2004-2005 school years. While \"[t]he existence of another adequate remedy does not preclude a judgment for declaratory relief in cases where it is appropriate,\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 57, plaintiffs are not entitled to use the declaratory judgment device as an instrument to double their recovery, in the absence of any authority allowing for double damages. <i>See, e.g., Pate v.

Further, the declarations violate the usual rule that the scope of declaratory relief cannot exceed the issues raised by the pleadings and supported by the evidence. <i>See</i> 10B Wright et al., <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> &#167; 2768, at 669 (3d ed.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Item 3</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The declaration that defendants' system for hiring ALJs violates the IDEA exceeds the scope of the allegations in the amended complaint, as well as the evidence presented at trial. The amended complaint alleged only the following with respect to the administrative proceedings: that Daz's administrative complaint \"was left aside without resolution in excess of the 45 days established for those proceedings\" and that \"plaintiffs were denied a fair administrative hearing conducted by an impartial hearing officer.\" The amended complaint made no mention of the system of hiring ALJs; nor did it state any connection between that system and the DOE's alleged failure to provide plaintiffs with a fair and timely resolution of their claims before the agency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence presented at trial was similarly inconclusive. Plaintiffs called to the stand Marlene Aponte Cabrera, a former ALJ with the DOE who had been terminated after a half-year of service. Aponte had no direct involvement in plaintiffs' administrative proceedings, but was allowed to testify to, in the district court's words, \"the way they handled things there, at the [DOE].\" Over defendants' hearsay and relevance objections, plaintiffs elicited testimony from Aponte that she personally did not feel independent in her judgments; that she \"was called upon some of [her] decisions\"; and that \"there were meetings,\" convened by certain DOE officials,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a> in which her \"decision[s] and [those] of other judges [were] discussed.\" Aponte also testified that less than twenty-four hours after a meeting in which Sonia Rosario, head of the special education section of the DOE, questioned Aponte about two of her recent decisions,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a> her contract with the DOE was rescinded.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aponte's testimony, even if true, does not support a broad declaration pronouncing the entire system of hiring ALJs in violation of the IDEA. Other than confirming that she signed a written contract with the DOE, Aponte did not even testify about the DOE's hiring practices for hearing officers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs rely primarily on what they allege are the terms of a written contract of employment between the DOE and hearing officers to argue that the declaration was proper. The contract itself was not admitted into evidence during Aponte's testimony; the record citations plaintiffs provide are not to the contract or to any document that would support their allegations; and, to the extent that the contract is buried somewhere within the administrative record and the fifteen volumes of appendices the parties have submitted to this court, it is plaintiffs' responsibility to direct the court's attention to it. Since the third item of declaratory relief is devoid of evidentiary support, the district court abused its discretion in granting it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Item 4</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For related reasons, the district court abused its discretion in entering the fourth item of declaratory relief, which declares Puerto Rico's systems of \"parental involvement in the IEP process[,] ... keeping minutes[,] and maintaining appropriate, complete administrative records\" in violation of the IDEA. The jury verdict established that defendants failed <i>in this case</i> to involve the parent in the IEP process and to maintain complete administrative records.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a> The amended complaint does not allege, and the evidence at trial did not show, that the failures are systemic. <i>See St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins.
