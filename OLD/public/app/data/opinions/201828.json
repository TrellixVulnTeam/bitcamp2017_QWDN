Petitioner Nai Qing Xu seeks\n\nreview of a decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA)\n\naffirming a denial of his application for asylum and withholding of\n\nremoval. Finding no error, we affirm.\n\nI. Background\n\n            The Immigration Judge (IJ) who heard his initial petition\n\ndetermined that Xu was not credible and therefore did not rely on\n\nXu's account in reaching his decision. On appeal, however, the BIA\n\ndetermined   that,   \"[e]ven   if   we    were   to   find   the   respondent\n\ncredible, we would nonetheless agree with the Immigration Judge\n\nthat the respondent failed to meet his burden of proof.\" In setting\n\nforth the facts of the case, we, like the BIA, presume Xu's\n\ntruthfulness, and recite the facts as he represented them in his\n\npetition.\n\n            Xu is a native and citizen of the People's Republic of\n\nChina. He was born on November 18, 1980, in Lianjiang, China. After\n\nattending school from 1989 to 1997, he began working as a clerk in\n\na store in his hometown. He was still employed at the store when,\n\nin June of 2001, he joined other members of his community at a\n\nlocal voting site where the village leadership was to be elected;\n\nthe contest was between the incumbent chief, whom Xu seems to have\n\nsupported, and an underworld challenger whose candidacy Xu opposed.\n\nAt the site, Xu protested the unfairness of the electoral process,\n\nexclaiming, \"What is this all about, this is not an election, let's\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fgo home.\" So saying, he and a group of other disaffected voters\n\nleft the voting site.\n\n            The        challenger,     apparently      displeased    by      Xu's\n\nperformance, expressed that displeasure by sending a squad of thugs\n\nto the store at which Xu worked, where the intruders beat him,\n\nthough not severely enough that he required hospitalization, and\n\nthreatened to close down the store if he dared to open it again. As\n\na result of the threat and the beating, Xu was scared to stay in\n\nhis hometown, and believed that, because of the trouble he had\n\ncaused, he would have difficulty getting the local government to\n\nsign off on certain documentation he needed, with the result that,\n\nwherever in China he went, he \"couldn't do anything.\" Xu fled to an\n\nadjacent town, eventually resolving to come to the United States.\n\nAfter an abortive attempt to depart via Thailand, Xu returned to\n\nChina,     finally making his way out of the country on a falsified\n\npassport, traveling from mainland China to Hong Kong, to the\n\nNetherlands, to Suriname, and from there to the United States.\n\n            Xu arrived on United States territory on October 20,\n\n2001.    Within hours of disembarking from a speedboat on the island\n\nof St. John in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Xu was caught and detained\n\nby agents of what was then the Immigration and Naturalization\n\nService (INS). The INS commenced removal proceedings against him on\n\nNovember    15    of    the   same   year.    Xu   conceded   removability    but\n\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\frequested asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the\n\nConvention Against Torture (CAT).\n\n          On July 17, 2003, an IJ denied all relief. The IJ\n\ndetermined that Xu was not credible and had presented little\n\nprobative evidence beyond his oral testimony. On that basis the IJ\n\nruled that Xu had not met his burden of proof with respect to any\n\nof the claimed grounds for relief. Xu timely appealed the IJ's\n\nasylum and withholding of removal determinations to the BIA. On\n\nNovember 16, 2004, the BIA affirmed the IJ's decision, holding that\n\nXu's account, even if true, did not justify granting asylum or\n\nwithholding of removal because he had failed to meet his burden of\n\nproof. Xu petitioned this court for review of the BIA's decision.\n\nII. Discussion\n\n          Here, Xu argues 1) that the determination of the IJ that\n\nhe was not credible is reviewable by this court and was in error.\n\nHe also argues 2) that the BIA erred in its holding that he failed\n\nto meet his burden of proof with respect to whether he held a well-\n\nfounded fear of future persecution, contending a) that the BIA\n\nshould   have    considered   whether   he   had   suffered   from   past\n\npersecution, and b) that it erred in finding he had not directly\n\nproved a well-founded fear of future persecution.1\n\n\n     1\n      Xu's initial petition for relief included a request for\nwithholding of removal and for protection under the CAT, but Xu did\nnot appeal the IJ's denial of his CAT claim to the BIA and does not\nnow challenge the BIA's denial of his request for withholding of\nremoval. Those issues are not before us, and we consider only Xu's\n\n                                  -4-\n\fA. Standard of Review\n\n          We uphold decisions of the BIA with respect to asylum if\n\n“supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on\n\nthe record considered as a whole.”   Settenda v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d\n\n89, 93 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S.\n\n478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)) This standard is\n\nknown as the \"substantial evidence\" standard. It is only by way of\n\nshorthand that we speak of \"substantial evidence,\" however, when\n\nthe issue presented, as here, is whether an agency was justified in\n\nfinding that a petitioner failed to carry his burden of proof,\n\nsince the agency's determination in such a case is based, not on\n\nsubstantial evidence supporting its decision, but on a petitioner's\n\nfailure to provide evidence that would support a holding in his\n\nfavor. In these circumstances, what we call \"substantial evidence\"\n\nreview permits us to reverse \"only if the petitioner's evidence\n\nwould compel a reasonable factfinder to conclude that relief was\n\nwarranted.\" Id.\n\nB. The IJ's Credibility Determination\n\n          Xu asks this court to require the BIA to make an express\n\nholding as to an asylum petitioner's credibility, or, where none\n\nhas been made, to review the IJ's decision for the reasonableness\n\nof his credibility determination. We cannot and need not review the\n\ncredibility determination of the IJ, however, because the BIA has\n\n\nasylum claim.\n\n                               -5-\n\fexplicitly     disclaimed        that     the    IJ's    adverse    credibility\n\ndetermination was part of the basis for the its holding.                   The BIA\n\nopinion is explicit that its holding that Xu did not meet his\n\nburden of proof would stand even if it had accepted Xu's story as\n\ntrue. (As we noted above, the BIA determined that, \"[e]ven if we\n\nwere to find the respondent credible, we would nonetheless agree\n\nwith the Immigration Judge that the respondent failed to meet his\n\nburden of proof.\") Because the BIA's decision did not turn on Xu's\n\ncredibility, the BIA did not have to, and did not, make its own\n\ndetermination of Xu's credibility. Where the BIA does not adopt an\n\nIJ's    opinion   but    instead    makes       an   independent,   superceding\n\ndecision, we review the decision of the BIA, and not that of the\n\nIJ. Njenga v. Ashcroft, 386 F.3d 335, 338 (1st Cir. 2004). Because\n\nthe BIA made no determination of Xu's credibility in reaching its\n\ndecision, Xu's credibility is not an issue here.\n\nC. Fear of Persecution\n\n             A petitioner hoping to receive asylum in the United\n\nStates bears the burden of establishing his eligibility by proving\n\nthat he qualifies as a refugee. 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1). This may be\n\ndone in either of two ways: \"(1) by demonstrating a well-founded\n\nfear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality,\n\nmembership in a particular social group, or political opinion, or\n\n(2)    by   proving    past   persecution       on   account   of   one    of    the\n\naforementioned        grounds,    which    entitles      an    applicant    to    a\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fpresumption   of    a    well-founded      fear   of   persecution.\"      Diab   v.\n\nAshcroft, 397 F.3d 35, 39 (1st Cir. 2005) (citing 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1101(a)(42)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)). The BIA did not address the\n\nquestion whether Xu proved past persecution, but found that Xu had\n\nfailed to directly prove a well-founded fear of future persecution.\n\nXu now claims that the BIA erred both in failing to address past\n\npersecution, and in finding him to have fallen short of proving a\n\nwell-founded fear of future persecution.\n\n           i. Past Persecution\n\n           The     IJ    considered    only    whether   Xu   had    established\n\ndirectly   that     he     suffered    a     well-founded     fear   of    future\n\npersecution, and did not address the sufficiency of Xu's claims of\n\npast persecution to establish a presumption that his fear of future\n\npersecution was well-founded. The BIA did not address the omission,\n\nand Xu now claims that it should have. The BIA was under no such\n\nobligation, however, because Xu did not argue the point to the BIA\n\nin his appeal from the IJ's decision, and so waived the issue.\n\n           \"Issues not raised before the Board may not be raised for\n\nthe first time upon judicial review of the Board's decisions.\"\n\nRavindran v. I.N.S., 976 F.2d 754, 761 (1st Cir. 1992).                          In\n\ndetermining whether an appeal of a particular issue from the BIA's\n\ndecision has been preserved, we read the record \"in the light most\n\nfavorable to petitioner.\"        Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\f           Xu   presented   the   BIA    with    the   question,   \"Whether\n\nRespondent has a well-founded fear for [sic] future persecution?\"\n\nWhile noting that a well-founded fear could be established either\n\ndirectly or presumptively through evidence of past persecution, Xu\n\nnever argued to the BIA that in his case his past persecution\n\njustified a presumption that his fear of persecution on his return\n\nwas well-founded. Mere notation of the applicable law, without any\n\nargumentation as to how it applies to a petitioner's case, does not\n\nraise the issue of its application. Xu's contention as to the legal\n\neffect of any persecution he experienced in the past was therefore\n\nnot raised before the BIA, and so may not be raised here.\n\n           ii. Direct Demonstration of a Fear of Persecution\n\n           All that remains is whether the BIA properly determined\n\nthat Xu had not offered sufficient direct proof that he had a well-\n\nfounded fear of persecution in China that would justify offering\n\nhim   asylum.   We   consider   both   whether   the   BIA's   opinion   was\n\nsufficiently clear to support our review, and the not-unrelated\n\nquestion whether the BIA's decision, if reviewable, was supported\n\nby the record or whether the petitioner's evidence should have\n\ncompelled it to hold otherwise.\n\n           Although the BIA's opinion was brief and summary in tone,\n\nwe find it sufficiently clear to permit meaningful review. We\n\nrecently reiterated that \"we may remand ... if the BIA's opinion\n\nfails to state with sufficient particularity and clarity the\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\freasons for denial of asylum.\" Halo v. Gonzales, No. 05-1076, 2005\n\nWL 1970795, at *3 (1st Cir. Aug. 17, 2005) (quoting Gailius v. INS,\n\n147 F.3d 34, 46 (1st Cir. 1998) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nIn Halo, the BIA affirmed an IJ's denial of asylum in an opinion\n\nmarkedly similar to the one it issued here, disclaiming reliance on\n\nthe IJ's adverse credibility determination and briefly indicating\n\nthat the petitioner had nevertheless failed to satisfy his burden\n\nof   proof.    The   BIA   must   indeed    set   forth   the   basis   for   its\n\ndetermination \"with such clarity as to be understandable,\" id.\n\n(quoting Gailius, 147 F.3d at 44), and here as in Halo the BIA\n\nopinion was brief and summary. When considering whether the clarity\n\nof an administrative decision is sufficient to support our review,\n\nhowever, we are not blind to the context in which the decision is\n\nmade or oblivious of the record on which it is based.\n\n              We held in Halo that, where the administrative record of\n\na case could easily be thought to compel a conclusion contrary to\n\nthe one reached by the BIA, it is incumbent on the agency to give\n\nsome reasoned explanation for the conclusion it reached. Here,\n\nbecause the danger Xu claimed he feared at home was so slight, the\n\nfacts speak for themselves, and could not easily be thought to\n\ncompel the BIA to find that Xu feared persecution at home. The\n\nBIA's short opinion satisfied our procedural requirements.\n\n              For the same reason, the facts did not compel the BIA to\n\nrule differently than it did in Xu's case, and so Xu's substantive\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fclaim that his case compels reversal of the BIA's decision fails.\n\nIn order to demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution on one\n\nof the relevant grounds by direct proof, a petitioner must satisfy\n\nthe BIA both that his fear is genuine, and that it is reasonable.\n\nMediouni v. I.N.S., 314 F.3d 24, 27 (1st Cir. 2002). Xu himself\n\nadmitted that he could return to his country without any fear of\n\nbeing hunted down, and the BIA cited that admission in determining\n\nthat he was not, in fact, afraid: \"We specifically note the\n\nrespondent's testimony stating that no one will look for him if he\n\nreturns and that one of the reasons he left was because he could\n\nnot   receive   'documentation.'   These   statements   contradict   the\n\nrespondent's alleged fear of harm.\" Because the BIA's opinion is\n\nnot deficient, and because Xu's evidence would not \"compel a\n\nreasonable factfinder to conclude that relief was warranted,\"\n\nMediouni, 314 F.3d at 27, we will not disturb the determination of\n\nthe BIA.\n\nIII. Conclusion\n\n           For the reasons stated above, we affirm the decision of\n\nthe BIA.\n\n           The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\f",

It is only by way of shorthand that we speak of \"substantial evidence,\" however, when the issue presented, as here, is whether an agency was justified in finding that a petitioner failed to carry his burden of proof, since the agency's determination in such a case is based, not on substantial evidence supporting its decision, but on a petitioner's failure to provide evidence that would support a holding in his favor. In these circumstances, what we call \"substantial evidence\" review permits us to reverse \"only if the petitioner's evidence would compel a reasonable factfinder to conclude that relief was warranted.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.

We cannot and need not review the credibility determination of the IJ, however, because the BIA has explicitly disclaimed that the IJ's adverse credibility determination was part of the basis for the its holding. The BIA opinion is explicit that its holding that Xu did not meet his burden of proof would stand even if it had accepted Xu's story as true. (As we noted above, the BIA determined that, \"[e]ven if we were to find the respondent credible, we would nonetheless agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent failed to meet his burden of proof.\") Because the BIA's decision did not turn on Xu's credibility, the BIA did not have to, and did not, make its own determination of Xu's credibility. Where the BIA does not adopt an IJ's opinion but instead makes an independent, superceding decision, we review the decision of the BIA, and not that of the IJ. <i>Njenga v.

Mere notation of the applicable law, without any argumentation as to how it applies to a petitioner's case, does not raise the issue of its application.

Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Immigration Judge (IJ) who heard his initial petition determined that Xu was not credible and therefore did not rely on Xu's account in reaching his decision. On appeal, however, the BIA determined that, \"[e]ven if we were to find the respondent credible, we would nonetheless agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent failed to meet his burden of proof.\" In setting forth the facts of the case, we, like the BIA, presume Xu's truthfulness, and recite the facts as he represented them in his petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Xu is a native and citizen of the People's Republic of China. He was born on November 18, 1980, in Lianjiang, China. After attending school from 1989 to 1997, he began working as a clerk in a store in his hometown. He was still employed at the store when, in June of 2001, he joined other members of his community at a local voting site where the village leadership was to be elected; the contest was between the incumbent chief, whom Xu seems to have supported, and an underworld challenger whose candidacy Xu opposed. At the site, Xu protested the unfairness of the electoral process, exclaiming, \"What is this all about, this is not an election, let's go home.\" So saying, he and a group of other disaffected voters left the voting site.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The challenger, apparently displeased by Xu's performance, expressed that displeasure by sending a squad of thugs to the store at which Xu worked, where the intruders beat him, though not severely enough that he required hospitalization, and threatened to close down the store if he dared to open it again. As a result of the threat and the beating, Xu was scared to stay in his hometown, and believed that, because of the trouble he had caused, he would have difficulty getting the local government to sign off on certain documentation he needed, with the result that, wherever in China he went, he \"couldn't do anything.\" Xu fled to an adjacent town, eventually resolving to come to the United States. After an abortive attempt to depart via Thailand, Xu returned to China, finally making his way out of the country on a falsified passport, traveling from mainland China to Hong Kong, to the Netherlands, to Suriname, and from there to the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Xu arrived on United States territory on October 20, 2001. Within hours of disembarking from a speedboat on the island of St. John in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Xu was caught and detained by agents of what was then the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). The INS commenced removal proceedings against him on November 15 of the same year. Xu conceded removability but requested asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 17, 2003, an IJ denied all relief. The IJ determined that Xu was not credible and had presented little probative evidence beyond his oral testimony. On that basis the IJ ruled that Xu had not met his burden of proof with respect to any of the claimed grounds for relief. Xu timely appealed the IJ's asylum and withholding of removal determinations to the BIA. On November 16, 2004, the BIA affirmed the IJ's decision, holding that Xu's account, even if true, did not justify granting asylum or withholding of removal because he had failed to meet his burden of proof. Xu petitioned this court for review of the BIA's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Xu argues 1) that the determination of the IJ that he was not credible is reviewable by this court and was in error. He also argues 2) that the BIA erred in its holding that he failed to meet his burden of proof with respect to whether he held a well-founded fear of future persecution, contending a) that the BIA should have considered whether he had suffered from past persecution, and b) that it erred in finding he had not directly proved a well-founded fear of future persecution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We uphold decisions of the BIA with respect to asylum if \"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\" <i>Settenda v.

It is only by way of shorthand that we speak of \"substantial evidence,\" however, when the issue presented, as here, is whether an agency was justified in finding that a petitioner failed to carry his burden of proof, since the agency's determination in such a case is based, not on substantial evidence supporting its decision, but on a petitioner's failure to provide evidence that would support a holding in his favor. In these circumstances, what we call \"substantial evidence\" review permits us to reverse \"only if the petitioner's evidence would compel a reasonable factfinder to conclude that relief was warranted.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The IJ's Credibility Determination</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Xu asks this court to require the BIA to make an express holding as to an asylum petitioner's credibility, or, where none has been made, to review the IJ's decision for the reasonableness of his credibility determination. We cannot and need not review the credibility determination of the IJ, however, because the BIA has explicitly disclaimed that the IJ's adverse credibility determination was part of the basis for the its holding. The BIA opinion is explicit that its holding that Xu did not meet his burden of proof would stand even if it had accepted Xu's story as true. (As we noted above, the BIA determined that, \"[e]ven if we were to find the respondent credible, we would nonetheless agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent failed to meet his burden of proof.\") Because the BIA's decision did not turn on Xu's credibility, the BIA did not have to, and did not, make its own determination of Xu's credibility. Where the BIA does not adopt an IJ's opinion but instead makes an independent, superceding decision, we review the decision of the BIA, and not that of the IJ. <i>Njenga v.
