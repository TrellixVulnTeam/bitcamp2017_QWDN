This appeal from the denial of social\n\nsecurity disability benefits focuses on whether the claimant's\n\nresidual functional capacity enables her to do work other than what\n\nshe did in the past, and whether, despite the claimant's exertional\n\n(back pain) and nonexertional (asthma and anxiety) limitations,\n\nthere remain a significant number of jobs in the national economy\n\nthat she    could   perform.      The   administrative    law   judge   (ALJ)\n\nanswered those questions in the affirmative, and the magistrate\n\njudge, sitting as the district court, see 28 U.S.C. § 636(c),\n\naffirmed.\n\n            On appeal, the claimant makes the following arguments:\n\n            (1) that the ALJ erred in relying, in part, on residual\n\nfunctional capacity reports prepared by consultants who had not\n\nexamined the claimant, and\n\n            (2) that the ALJ erred in concluding that the claimant's\n\nresidual functional capacity was not significantly undermined by\n\nher nonexertional impairments and therefore relying on the medical\n\nvocational guidelines (the Grid) to determine that jobs exist that\n\nthe claimant can perform.\n\nGiven the deferential standard of judicial review applicable here,\n\nsee,   e.g.,   Richardson   v.   Perales,   402   U.S.   389,   399   (1971);\n\nRodriguez v. Sec'y of HHS, 647 F.2d 218, 222 (1st Cir. 1981),\n\nneither of those arguments warrants reversal.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f                  Reports by Nonexamining Consultants\n\n            Although we have encouraged the Commissioner to obtain a\n\nresidual functional capacity report from an examining consultant,\n\nRivera-Torres v. Sec'y of HHS, 837 F.2d 4, 6 (1st Cir. 1988),\n\nreports from nonexamining, nontestifying consultants are \"entitled\n\nto evidentiary weight, which 'will vary with the circumstances,'\"\n\nBerrios Lopez v. Sec'y of HHS, 951 F.2d 427, 431 (1st Cir. 1991)\n\n(per curiam) (quoting Rodriguez, 647 F.2d at 223).1                      Greater\n\nreliance    on   such   reports    is    warranted      where,   as   here,   the\n\nnonexamining consultants, Hilario De La Iglesia, Ph.D., and Luis R.\n\nVecchini,    M.D.,   who   prepared      the   mental    residual     functional\n\ncapacity report, reviewed the reports of examining and treating\n\ndoctors before doing so and supported their conclusions with\n\nreference to medical findings. See Berrios Lopez, 951 F.2d at 431.\n\n            In   this   case,     we    need   not   consider     whether     the\n\nnonexamining     psychiatric    consultants'      report,    standing     alone,\n\nconstitutes substantial evidence to support the ALJ's decision\n\nconcerning the claimant's mental residual functional capacity. Cf.\n\nBerrios Lopez, 951 F.2d at 431 (finding such reports sufficient\n\nunder similar circumstances).           In this instance, the record also\n\ncontains comments on the claimant's residual functional capacity by\n\n\n\n     1\n      Because the claimant here voluntarily waived her right to an\nevidentiary hearing and chose to rely solely on the documentary\nrecord, she cannot complain about her resulting inability to cross-\nexamine the nonexamining consultants.\n\n                                        -3-\n\fan examining consultant, Dr. Alberto Rodriguez Robles, and two\n\ntreating psychiatrists, Dr. Ingrid Alicea-Berrios and Dr. Arias-\n\nBoneta.    This is, therefore, not a case in which the nonexamining\n\nconsultants' reports were the only evidence of the claimant's\n\nresidual functional capacity.     Cf. Heggarty v. Sullivan, 947 F.2d\n\n990, 997 (1st Cir. 1991). Nor is it a case in which the only\n\nevidence consists of \"raw, technical medical data.\" Cf. Berrios v.\n\nSec'y of HHS, 796 F.2d 574, 576 (1st Cir. 1986) (remanding because\n\nthere was \"nothing in the record, intelligible to a lay person\"\n\nanent claimaint's residual functional capacity).\n\n           Although the claimant argues that the ALJ should not have\n\nrelied on reports of nonexamining consultants, she does not argue\n\nthat any particular finding of the ALJ is unsupported by other\n\nsubstantial evidence in the record.        In fact, although the reports\n\nof the examining psychiatrists differ in some details from that of\n\nthe nonexamining consultants, both sets of experts seem to agree\n\nwith the ALJ's conclusion that, despite her mental impairments, the\n\nclaimant   retains   the   capacity   to   follow   simple   instructions\n\ninvolved in unskilled work.     The examining psychiatrists' reports\n\nalso lend some support to the ALJ's subsidiary findings that the\n\nclaimant retains the capacity for social functioning and for\n\nconcentration, at least for short periods.          Indeed, one of the\n\nclaimant's treating psychiatrists reported that, with medication,\n\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fthe claimant's self-esteem, independence, and attitude toward life\n\nhave improved.\n\n            In light of that substantial evidence supporting the\n\nALJ's decision as to the claimant's mental residual functional\n\ncapacity,    it   is   inconsequential       that,    in   some   respects,   the\n\nexamining    psychiatrists       characterized       the   claimaint's   mental\n\nimpairments as imposing more limits than did the nonexamining\n\nconsultants.      See Berrios Lopez, 951 F.2d at 429.             In particular,\n\nthe ALJ's discrediting of claimant's claims that she was unable to\n\ndo   any   activities    of    daily   living   was    warranted,     given   the\n\nconflicting evidence in the record on this issue.                 Resolving such\n\nconflicts is for the ALJ, not for a reviewing court.                  Rodriguez,\n\n647 F.2d at 222.\n\n                          Reliance on the Grid\n\n            Simply because a claimant suffers from both exertional\n\nand nonexertional impairments does not necessarily preclude using\n\nthe Grid to determine whether jobs exist that the claimant could\n\nperform.     Rather, where a nonexertional impairment has been\n\n\"found to impose no significant restriction on the range of work\n\na claimant is exertionally able to perform, reliance on the Grid\n\nremains appropriate.\"         Ortiz v. Sec'y of HHS, 890 F.2d         520, 524\n\n(1st Cir. 1989); see also 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 2,\n\n§ 2.00(e)(2).      As long as the nonexertional impairment \"has the\n\neffect only of reducing th[e] occupational base marginally, the\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fGrid remains highly relevant and can be relied on exclusively to\n\nyield a finding as to disability.\"              Ortiz, 890 F.2d at 524.\n\nWhile use of a vocational expert may be helpful in complex cases,\n\nsuch use is not required.          See Social Security Ruling 96-9p,\n\nDetermining   Capability    to   Do    Other    Work–-Implications       of   a\n\nResidual Functional Capacity for Less than a Full Range of\n\nSedentary Work, 1996 WL 374185, at *9 (S.S.A. July 2, 1996).\n\n           Here,   considering        only   the   claimant's exertional\n\nlimitation (back pain), which allowed her to do \"medium\" work, in\n\ncombination with her age (45, which is considered a \"younger\n\nindividual,\" 20 C.F.R. § 404.1563(c)) and her education (high\n\nschool   graduate),   the   Grid    would      dictate    a   finding   of    no\n\ndisability.    See 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 2, table 3.\n\nThis is so regardless of the claimant's previous skilled-work\n\nexperience.   See id., rules 203.25-203.31.              Therefore, that the\n\nclaimant's mental impairments limit her to unskilled work makes\n\nno difference in the number of jobs available.\n\n           The claimant argues that her limitations in social\n\nfunctioning would make her unable to get along with supervisors\n\nand coworkers and would therefore so restrict her ability to do\n\nunskilled work as to require a vocational expert to determine\n\nwhether sufficient jobs exist that she could perform.               However,\n\nthe ALJ expressly found that the claimant can \"relate normally to\n\nco-workers and supervisors.\"           That finding is supported              by\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fsubstantial evidence in the record, including the claimant's own\n\nstatements.   Even claimant's treating psychiatrist rated the\n\nclaimant's social functioning as only \"moderately limited\" in\n\nmost respects.\n\n          Nor should the claimant's inability to be exposed to\n\nextreme temperatures, chemicals, dust, fumes, and gases–-due to\n\nher asthma–-reduce, more than marginally, the broad occupational\n\nbase generally available to a younger individual with a high-\n\nschool education who is able to do medium, light, or sedentary\n\nwork.   See      See   SSR   96-9p,   supra,   1996   WL   374185,   at   *9\n\n(explaining that \"[e]ven a need to avoid all exposure to these\n\nconditions would not, by itself, result in a significant erosion\n\nof the occupational base for sedentary work\").             As noted by the\n\nALJ, that base includes approximately 2,500 separate sedentary,\n\nlight, and medium occupations, each of which represents numerous\n\njobs in the national economy.         See 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P,\n\napp. 2, § 203.00).\n\n          We need go no further.        For the reasons stated above,\n\nwe conclude that the Commissioner's decision was supported by\n\nsubstantial evidence.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f",

July 2, 1996).\n\n           Here,   considering        only   the   claimant's exertional\n\nlimitation (back pain), which allowed her to do \"medium\" work, in\n\ncombination with her age (45, which is considered a \"younger\n\nindividual,\" 20 C.F.R. § 404.1563(c)) and her education (high\n\nschool   graduate),   the   Grid    would      dictate    a   finding   of    no\n\ndisability.    See 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 2, table 3.\n\nThis is so regardless of the claimant's previous skilled-work\n\nexperience.   See id., rules 203.25-203.31.              Therefore, that the\n\nclaimant's mental impairments limit her to unskilled work makes\n\nno difference in the number of jobs available.\n\n           The claimant argues that her limitations in social\n\nfunctioning would make her unable to get along with supervisors\n\nand coworkers and would therefore so restrict her ability to do\n\nunskilled work as to require a vocational expert to determine\n\nwhether sufficient jobs exist that she could perform.               However,\n\nthe ALJ expressly found that the claimant can \"relate normally to\n\nco-workers and supervisors.\"           That finding is supported              by\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fsubstantial evidence in the record, including the claimant's own\n\nstatements.   Even claimant's treating psychiatrist rated the\n\nclaimant's social functioning as only \"moderately limited\" in\n\nmost respects.\n\n          Nor should the claimant's inability to be exposed to\n\nextreme temperatures, chemicals, dust, fumes, and gases–-due to\n\nher asthma–-reduce, more than marginally, the broad occupational\n\nbase generally available to a younger individual with a high-\n\nschool education who is able to do medium, light, or sedentary\n\nwork.   See      See   SSR   96-9p,   supra,   </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1996</span>   <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>   <span class=\"page\">374185</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,   at   *9\n\n(explaining that \"[e]ven a need to avoid all exposure to these\n\nconditions would not, by itself, result in a significant erosion\n\nof the occupational base for sedentary work\").             As noted by the\n\nALJ, that base includes approximately 2,500 separate sedentary,\n\nlight, and medium occupations, each of which represents numerous\n\njobs in the national economy.         See 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P,\n\napp. 2, § 203.00).\n\n          We need go no further.        For the reasons stated above,\n\nwe conclude that the Commissioner's decision was supported by\n\nsubstantial evidence.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f</pre>",
