This suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n\nasserting    excessive   force   and   conspiracy   claims   raises   two\n\ninteresting issues not directly addressed before by this circuit.\n\nThe first is whether the Supreme Court's decision in Heck v.\n\nHumphrey, 512 U.S. 477, 486-87 (1994), bars the civil rights claim\n\nasserting excessive force brought by plaintiff Thore, who earlier\n\npled guilty to state criminal charges, arising from the same event,\n\nof assault with a dangerous weapon on police officers.        The second\n\nissue is whether Thore is judicially estopped from asserting facts\n\ninconsistent with the facts to which Thore agreed during the plea\n\ncolloquy.    Thore admits that if he is judicially estopped from\n\nasserting facts inconsistent with the plea colloquy, then his\n\nexcessive force claim cannot succeed.\n\n            On February 8, 2002, Charles Thore pled guilty in state\n\ncourt to several charges, including three counts of assault and\n\nbattery with a dangerous weapon (to wit, a car) on three police\n\nofficers, one count of assault and battery, one count of operating\n\na motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol, one count of\n\noperating after suspension, and one count of operating to endanger.\n\nThe charges stemmed from his drunken driving encounter with police\n\nofficers on October 17, 2001, during which Thore was shot in the\n\nneck by Fitchburg police officer Jeffrey Howe. Six other Fitchburg\n\npolice officers and three Massachusetts state police detectives\n\nalso were involved.\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\f            During his plea colloquy, Thore, who was represented by\n\ncounsel, said that he agreed with an account of the facts stated by\n\nthe prosecution.     Thore knowingly and voluntarily pled guilty.   As\n\na result of his plea bargain, Thore received the benefit of a joint\n\nsentencing recommendation of a four-year sentence of imprisonment,\n\nwhich was accepted by the court.        He avoided a potential ten-to-\n\ntwelve-year sentence, and had the benefit of dismissal of other\n\ncharges.\n\n            In August 2003, Thore brought an action in state superior\n\ncourt under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the officers; the case was\n\nremoved to federal court.       His original complaint alleged that\n\nOfficer Howe had used excessive force in shooting him and had\n\nengaged in assault and battery.      After discovery, he amended his\n\ncomplaint in November 2004, adding claims that six Fitchburg police\n\nofficers,    three   Massachusetts   State   Police   detectives   (who\n\ninvestigated Officer Howe's use of force), and Officer Howe had all\n\nconspired to cover up the circumstances of the shooting and had\n\nmaliciously abused process.\n\n            The district court entered summary judgment for all\n\ndefendants in a thoughtful opinion.          The court held that the\n\ndoctrine of judicial estoppel barred Thore from asserting facts\n\ninconsistent with the facts to which he admitted during his plea\n\ncolloquy in the Worcester Superior Court.       As a result, the court\n\nreasoned, Thore's § 1983 excessive force and state law assault and\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fbattery    claims    failed      to    overcome      Officer   Howe's    qualified\n\nimmunity.     The district court also held that Heck v. Humphrey\n\nbarred assertion of the § 1983 malicious abuse of process and\n\nconspiracy claims against all defendants and that, in any event, no\n\nclaim was stated under § 1983 as to either malicious abuse of\n\nprocess or conspiracy.        The court did not reach the Heck issue as\n\nto the excessive force claim.\n\n            Thore appeals, arguing that judicial estoppel should not\n\napply to bar him from asserting inconsistent facts because he now\n\nhas evidence that some of the facts asserted at the plea colloquy\n\nare not true.       He also argues that Heck v. Humphrey does not bar\n\nhim from asserting any of his claims.               He concedes that if judicial\n\nestoppel applies, then the district court was correct in entering\n\njudgment for Officer Howe on the excessive force claim.                    He does\n\nnot appeal the dismissal of the abuse of process claim.\n\n                                         I.\n\n            Thore pled guilty to three counts of assault and battery\n\nwith a deadly weapon (a car), see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265 § 15A(b),\n\nas well as other crimes.              Under Massachusetts law, assault and\n\nbattery may be proven using two alternate theories.                      Under the\n\nfirst, an assault and battery is \"the intentional and unjustified\n\nuse   of   force    upon   the    person       of   another,   however    slight.\"\n\nCommonwealth v. Burno, 487 N.E. 2d 1366, 1368-69 (Mass. 1986)\n\n(quoting Commonwealth v. McCan, 178 N.E. 633, 634 (Mass. 1931))\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\f(internal quotation marks omitted).             Under the second theory,\n\nassault and battery is the \"intentional commission of a wanton or\n\nreckless   act    (something   more     than   gross   negligence)   causing\n\nphysical   or    bodily   injury   to   another.\"      Id.   at   1369.   In\n\nMassachusetts, assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon\n\n\"is a general intent crime, [and] there is no requirement that the\n\nCommonwealth must prove the defendant had a specific intent to\n\ninjure the victim. To find the requisite intent, however, the jury\n\nmust find beyond a reasonable doubt that the touching did not\n\nhappen accidentally.\" Commonwealth v. Ford, 677 N.E. 2d 1149, 1152\n\n(Mass. 1997) (citations omitted).\n\n           We start with the facts the prosecution recited and to\n\nwhich Thore agreed at his plea colloquy in state court:\n\n           On October 17th, 2001, at approximately 7:20\n           p.m., Sergeant Glen Fossa of the Fitchburg\n           police department while off duty observed a\n           blue Volkswag[e]n operating erratically on\n           John     Fitch     Highway    in     Fitchburg,\n           Massachusetts.    The John Fitch Highway is a\n           public way in the city of Fitchburg. The blue\n           Volkswag[e]n almost struck the passenger side\n           of the vehicle occupied by Sergeant Fossa.\n           Both vehicles stopped.     The operator of the\n           blue    Volkswag[e]n,   Charles    Thore,   the\n           defendant, started to get out of the vehicle\n           he was operating and began yelling at Sergeant\n           Fossa. Sergeant Fossa observed that Mr. Thore\n           appeared to be having a confrontation with a\n           female passenger in his vehicle. The female\n           passenger was later identified as Jessilyn\n           Chabot.     Mr. Thore got back in the blue\n           Volkswag[e]n and began to drive away wildly,\n           passing cars in the turn-only lanes of the\n           John Fitch Highway. Sergeant Fossa reported\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fthe blue Volkswag[e]n to the Fitchburg police\ndepartment.\n\n       Sergeant John Kell[e]y and Officer\nMatthew Dibara responded to the John Fitch\nHighway. Sergeant Fossa pointed out the blue\nVolkswag[e]n to the responding Fitchburg\nofficers. Sergeant Fossa observed Mr. Thore\nholding Miss Chabot in a headlock, and he\nappeared to be hitting and/or struggling with\nMiss Chabot.   Miss Chabot reported that Mr.\nThore was choking her and that he slapped her\nin the face twice because she was breaking up\nwith him. Miss Chabot was pregnant with Mr.\nThore's child at the time.\n\n       Officer Dibara approached the blue\nVolkswag[e]n and instructed Mr. Thore to\nplease turn off the engine and step from the\nvehicle.    Mr. Thore did not comply and\neventually placed the vehicle in reverse and\naccelerated. Officer Dibara reached into an\nopen window and attempted to stop the blue\nVolkswag[e]n out of concern for the safety of\nMiss Chabot.    Officer Dibara held onto Mr.\nThore as he was dragged somewhat and was\nforced to run at times to keep pace with the\nvehicle.    Officer Dibara disengaged after\nabout 25 feet, fearing for his life. At times\nthroughout the incident the blue Volkswag[e]n\noperated by Mr. Thore came into contact with\nOfficer Dibara.\n\n       Mr. Thore attempted to flee through the\nparking lot but was headed off by Sergeant\nKell[e]y and Fitchburg police officer Jeffrey\nHowe, who were operating separate police\ncruisers.   Mr. Thore began to strike both\ncruisers operated by Sergeant Kell[e]y and\nOfficer Howe with the blue Volkswag[e]n.\n\n       At one point Officer Dibara ordered Mr.\nThore to stop at gunpoint. Mr. Thore looked\nat Officer Dibara and stated, \"Fucking shoot\nme.\" Officer Dibara re-holstered his weapon\nand attempted to pull Mr. Thore from the\nvehicle. Mr. Thore again accelerated, broke\nfree, and struck Officer Howe's cruiser on the\n\n                     -6-\n\f           driver's door, pushing Officer Howe and his\n           cruiser into a tractor trailer truck and\n           nearly striking Officer Dibara.        Officer\n           Dibara heard Mr. Thore's vehicle revving as\n           Mr. Thore was apparently attempting to move\n           the blue Volkswag[e]n in an unknown direction.\n           Fearing for his life, and that of Officer\n           Dibara[], Officer Howe fired three shots from\n           his firearm at this point. One round struck\n           Mr. Thore in the neck.\n\nThis is a matter of record; there is no disagreement that Thore\n\nagreed to these facts.\n\n           Thore argues that the facts to which he admitted are not\n\ntrue as to whether the officers were endangered or in fear for\n\ntheir lives.   He argues he can prove this through the testimony of\n\na disinterested third-party witness, one Jon Laro, the truck driver\n\nunder whose truck Officer Howe's cruiser was pushed.              Laro, at\n\ndeposition in this case, gave a markedly different version of the\n\nevents that contradicted those (a) recited in the plea colloquy and\n\n(b)   contained   in   the   two   statements   the   police   recorded   on\n\ninterviewing Laro, which Laro signed shortly after the event (and\n\nwhich fully supported the facts recited at the colloquy).                 At\n\ndeposition, Laro said that Thore's car, a blue Volkswagen, had not\n\nstruck the police cars, but that the police cars had repeatedly\n\nstruck Thore's car and had him boxed in so his car could not move.\n\nThe witness stated the officers were never placed in danger by\n\nThore and that Officer Howe had no reason to shoot Thore:\n\n           They really had him stopped, pinned down when\n           they had him up against that building to be\n           honest with you. To me, I don't know, maybe\n\n                                     -7-\n\f          if I was a police officer I think I would have\n          just shot the guy's tires.     He ain't going\n          nowhere, you know, I don't know.     I didn't\n          really feel there was a need to shoot the kid\n          let's put it that way. I know the kid wasn't\n          right but they weren't right and two wrongs\n          don't make a right and that's what happened\n          here.\n\n          By contrast, the typed notes of Detective Kymalainen's\n\ninterview with Laro on October 17, 2001 present a different picture\n\nof what Laro saw:\n\n          Q.   [Police] After the car hit cruiser five\n          what did it do?\n          A. [Laro] The car's engine revved and he went\n          flying in reverse away from the police car, he\n          turned hard right in reverse and backed into a\n          parked car about fifteen feet maybe. He was\n          out of control backing up, I thought for sure\n          he was going to hit one of the cops that was\n          near his car.\n          Q. Where were the police officers?\n          A. I think there were two officers, there may\n          have been more, but I remember they ran past\n          my tractor towards the blue car after it\n          struck cruiser five. There were a couple of\n          seconds were [sic] the car was stopped after\n          it hit car five. The cops ran to the car, I\n          saw them with their guns out, when they got\n          near the car they pointed their guns at him\n          and yelled at the guy to get out of the car.\n          Those officers yelled at the man to get out,\n          they were very loud.     I heard the officer\n          shout several times to get out of the car.\n          The guy didn't get out, he just jammed it in\n          reverse and went backwards, it was lucky\n          nobody didn't get hit because he almost ran\n          them over.\n          . . .\n          Q. Prior to the shots what did you think the\n          operator of the blue car was going to do after\n          it struck the parked car?\n          A. It was going to try and get away again,\n          there was nothing stopping this guy, he was\n\n\n                               -8-\n\f              like a lunatic. I really thought the guy was\n              going to run those officers over.\n\nAs noted, Laro signed the statement on or about October 17, 2001.\n\nThis   typed    interview   is    entirely     consistent   with    handwritten\n\ninterview notes, which Laro also signed and initialed.                        Laro\n\ntestified he does recall being interviewed, but denied saying a\n\nnumber of things that are recorded in the notes.             Thore maintains\n\nthe police forged the notes as part of a cover up.\n\n              Thore argues that until Laro's deposition, he had simply\n\nrelied on the reports the police had given him as to Laro's account\n\nof the events and that this induced him to plead guilty.                   He says\n\nthat had he known Laro's true account, he would not have pled\n\nguilty or admitted to certain facts.           He points out that he has no\n\nmemory   of    events   after    being    shot.    He   argues     there    was   a\n\nconspiracy by the Fitchburg and state police to misstate the\n\nevidence of the third-party witness, and thus create, after the\n\nfact, a justification for the shooting.\n\n              Thore also argues he should be permitted to prove that\n\nthe police knew that he was not armed (because his girlfriend told\n\nthem), that his car was boxed in by the cruisers and so his own car\n\ncould not move or harm the officers, and that the officers were\n\nnever endangered.       Based on those facts, he argues that under the\n\nstandards of Brosseau v. Haugen, 543 U.S. 194 (2004), and Graham v.\n\nConnor, 490 U.S. 386 (1989), it was objectively unreasonable for an\n\nofficer to shoot him.\n\n                                         -9-\n\f                                     II.\n\n           The    order   appealed   from   grants   summary   judgment   to\n\ndefendants.      Our review of entry of summary judgment is de novo.\n\nSee Nelson v. Kline, 242 F.3d 33, 34 (1st Cir. 2001).             We note,\n\nhowever, that \"summary judgment\" is a bit of a misnomer here.             At\n\nissue are several matters which are committed to the district\n\ncourt, not a jury, in the first instance.        Whether the case states\n\na viable § 1983 claim in the first place and whether the case\n\nstates a viable § 1983 claim in light of Heck are issues of law for\n\nthe court.       Similarly, whether to apply the judicial estoppel\n\ndoctrine is also an issue for the court, not the jury, to decide.\n\nSee New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742, 750 (2001) (\"[J]udicial\n\nestoppel 'is an equitable doctrine invoked by a court at its\n\ndiscretion.'\"     (quoting Russell v. Rolfs, 893 F.2d 1033, 1037 (9th\n\nCir. 1990))).     As to the application of these doctrines, there is\n\nno dispute that if plaintiff fails to state a claim, if Heck          bars\n\nthe claim, or if judicial estoppel binds Thore to the facts stated\n\nat the plea colloquy, then the case must be dismissed.\n\nA.   The Conspiracy Claim\n\n           The district court correctly dismissed the conspiracy\n\ncount for failure to state a claim.         Thore alleged in his amended\n\ncomplaint that Officer Howe, six other Fitchburg police officers,\n\nand three Massachusetts state police detectives conspired against\n\nhim \"to justify the illegal shooting . . . by Officer Jeffrey\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fHowe,\" thereby violating his \"constitutional right to be free from\n\nthe use of a conspiracy by persons acting under color of law.\"\n\nHowever, there is no such constitutional right, nor is there any\n\nfederal law guaranteeing freedom from conspiracy.\n\n            It is important to note that \"[w]hile conspiracies may be\n\nactionable under section 1983, it is necessary that there have\n\nbeen,   besides    the   agreement   [among    conspirators],    an   actual\n\ndeprivation of a right secured by the Constitution and laws.\"\n\nLandrigan v. City of Warwick, 628 F.2d 736, 742 (1st Cir. 1980);\n\nsee also Santiago v. Fenton, 891 F.2d 373, 389 (1st Cir. 1989);\n\nEarle v. Benoit, 850 F.2d 836, 844 (1st Cir. 1988).               Thus, an\n\nallegation    of   conspiracy   to    deprive    someone   of,   say,   his\n\nconstitutional right to due process states a claim under § 1983,\n\ncf. Slotnick v. Staviskey, 560 F.2d 31, 34 (1st Cir. 1977), but an\n\nallegation of conspiracy to justify an illegal shooting does not.\n\n            Thore failed to identify in his amended complaint a\n\nfederally protected right of which he was deprived by the alleged\n\nconspiracy. He acknowledges as much on appeal by now attempting to\n\ncast his claim as a conspiracy to deprive him of his § 1983 right\n\nof action for excessive force.              In Landrigan, we \"assume[d],\n\nwithout deciding, that [a claim alleging deprivation of a § 1983\n\nright of action], sufficiently advanced, could have amounted to an\n\nactionable deprivation of federally protected rights.\" 628 F.2d at\n\n742.    Here, however, Thore's claim is not \"sufficiently advanced\"\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fto merit our consideration of this issue.              Thore has conceded that\n\nhis \"claim is not precisely pled\"; we further find that, contrary\n\nto plaintiff's contention, the gravamen of his claim does not make\n\nout an alleged deprivation of his § 1983 right of action.                     Thore\n\nmerely asserted that the defendants, under color of law, conspired\n\nto justify the shooting, and that this violated his constitutional\n\nrights.       Under   these      circumstances,      we   decline    to    \"rewrite\n\n[Thore's]     complaint     by    inserting    legal      claims   not    mentioned\n\ntherein.\"     Pujol v. Shearson/Am. Express, Inc., 829 F.2d 1201,\n\n1205-06     (1st   Cir.   1987)     (rejecting      plaintiffs'     invitation   to\n\nconstrue their complaint as containing elements of certain RICO\n\nviolations when it did not state so directly).\n\nB.   The Excessive Force Claim\n\n             Defendant Howe argues that Heck v. Humphrey bars Thore's\n\n§ 1983 claim for excessive force.            He also argues that the doctrine\n\nof judicial estoppel justifies the district court's entry of\n\nsummary judgment in his favor.\n\n1.   The Heck v. Humphrey Rule\n\n             In Heck v. Humphrey, the Supreme Court held that where a\n\n§ 1983 suit for damages would \"necessarily imply\" the invalidity of\n\nan inmate's conviction, or \"necessarily imply\" the invalidity of\n\nthe length of any inmate's sentence, such a claim is not cognizable\n\nunder   §   1983   unless     and    until    the   inmate   obtains      favorable\n\nresolution of a challenge to his conviction.                  Heck, 512 U.S. at\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\f487.    As    a    result,     the     district    court    must   consider    the\n\nrelationship between the § 1983 claim and the conviction, including\n\nasking whether the plaintiff could prevail only by \"negat[ing] an\n\nelement of the offense of which he [was] convicted.\"                  Id. at 486\n\nn.6.   Only       if   a   \"judgment    in   favor   of    the   plaintiff    would\n\nnecessarily imply the invalidity of the conviction or sentence\"\n\ndoes the court go on to ask whether that conviction or sentence has\n\nin fact been invalidated.         Id. at 487.\n\n          Thore argues that his claim does not necessarily imply\n\nthe invalidity of his conviction.              The Supreme Court has, in many\n\ncivil rights actions, including in Heck, held that a § 1983 claim\n\nis stated where there is no necessary implication of the invalidity\n\nof the conviction.         See id. at 487 n.7; see also Hill v. McDonough,\n\n126 S. Ct. 2096, 2100 (2006); Wilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U.S. 74, 82\n\n(2005); Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U.S. 637, 643 (2004); Muhammad v.\n\nClose, 540 U.S. 749, 753, 755 (2004).\n\n          Similarly, in Figueroa v. Rivera, 147 F.3d 77 (1st Cir.\n\n1998), this court held that Heck did not bar a prisoner's § 1983\n\nclaim arising from alleged indifference to an inmate's medical\n\nneeds, but did bar a § 1983 claim for wrongful conviction and\n\nimprisonment.      Id. at 82.     Notably, Figueroa also held that there\n\nare no equitable exceptions to the Heck rule.                Id. at 80-81.\n\n          A § 1983 excessive force claim brought against a police\n\nofficer that arises out of the officer's use of force during an\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\farrest does not necessarily call into question the validity of an\n\nunderlying state conviction and so is not barred by Heck.                   See,\n\ne.g., VanGilder v. Baker, 435 F.3d 689, 692 (7th Cir. 2006).\n\n             Even the fact that defendant was convicted of assault on\n\na   police   officer   does   not,   under   Heck,   as   a   matter   of    law\n\nnecessarily bar a § 1983 claim of excessive force.            See Smithart v.\n\nTowery, 79 F.3d 951, 952-53 (9th Cir. 1996); see also Ballard v.\n\nBurton, 444 F.3d 391, 399-400 (5th Cir. 2006) (holding that a state\n\nconviction for simple assault did not necessarily imply that the\n\ndefendant did not use excessive force).\n\n             In this case Thore asserts two theories.           The first is\n\nthat he was not guilty of assault at all, and so Officer Howe's use\n\nof force was excessive.       That theory is plainly barred by Heck.\n\n             The more modest second theory is that his excessive force\n\nclaim need not impugn his convictions for assault and battery with\n\na dangerous weapon in order to establish that Officer Howe used\n\nexcessive force.       Thore says that even if his car had previously\n\nhit the cruisers and brushed Officer Dibara's body, by the time of\n\nthe shooting, Thore was stationary in a car, boxed in with nowhere\n\nto go, and posed no threat to the officers, who had been told that\n\nhe had no gun.\n\n             Just as it is true that a § 1983 excessive force claim\n\nafter an assault conviction is not necessarily barred by Heck, it\n\nis also true that it is not necessarily free from Heck.                     The\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fexcessive force claim and the conviction may be so interrelated\n\nfactually as to bar the § 1983 claim.      See, e.g., Cunningham v.\n\nGates, 312 F.3d 1148, 1154-55 (9th Cir. 2002).\n\n            Officer Howe argues, relying on Cunningham, that this is\n\nsuch a case: that Thore's third conviction for assault and battery\n\nwith a dangerous weapon was based on his refusal to obey commands\n\nto get out of his car, and on his gunning his engine to start to\n\nget away.    In doing so, he endangered the two officers:   Officer\n\nDibara on foot and Officer Howe in his cruiser.      We cannot tell\n\nfrom the record before us whether this is so.\n\n            While we conclude that Heck does not automatically bar\n\nconsideration of an excessive force claim by an individual who has\n\nbeen convicted of assault, the record before us does not permit a\n\ndetermination of the requisite relatedness.    Accordingly, we move\n\non to consider whether Thore is barred by judicial estoppel from\n\ndenying the facts he admitted in the plea colloquy.\n\n2.   Judicial Estoppel\n\n            We provide some background on the judicial estoppel\n\ndoctrine.    Before the Supreme Court addressed the use of judicial\n\nestoppel doctrine in federal courts, this court had permitted\n\ninvocation of the doctrine.    See, e.g., Patriot Cinemas, Inc. v.\n\nGen. Cinema Corp., 834 F.2d 208, 215 (1st Cir. 1987) (binding party\n\nto its prior representation that it would not pursue a claim).\n\n\n\n\n                                -15-\n\f            In New Hampshire v. Maine, the Supreme Court held that\n\njudicial estoppel could be utilized in the federal courts.                   532\n\nU.S. at 756.       The court defined judicial estoppel as a doctrine\n\nwhich \"generally prevents a party from prevailing in one phase of\n\na case on an argument and then relying on a contradictory argument\n\nto prevail in another phase.\"            New Hampshire, 532 U.S. at 749\n\n(quoting    Pegram    v.   Herdrich,    530   U.S.   211,    227   n.8   (2000))\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Unlike the doctrine of issue\n\npreclusion, judicial estoppel does not require that the issue have\n\nbeen actually litigated in the prior proceeding. Id. at 748-49; 18\n\nMoore's Federal Practice § 134.30, at 134-69 (3d ed. 2005).\n\n            In New Hampshire, the Court recognized that, although New\n\nHampshire    was     equitably   barred       from   asserting     a     position\n\n(concerning a river boundary) contrary to a position it had taken\n\nin earlier litigation which had culminated in a consent decree,\n\njudicial estoppel might be inappropriate when a party's prior\n\nposition was based on inadvertence or mistake.              New Hampshire, 532\n\nU.S. at 753.       But the Court rejected New Hampshire's \"mistake\"\n\nargument that it had failed to do searching historic research\n\nearlier, and that if New Hampshire had known then what it knew now,\n\nit would not have entered into the consent decree.              Id. at 753-54.\n\nThe Court noted that New Hampshire had had every incentive to do\n\nthat research earlier.       Id. at 754.      The Court also noted that the\n\nstate's inconsistent position would give New Hampshire an advantage\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\fat Maine's expense.    Id. at 755.     Furthermore, it is clear that New\n\nHampshire's    inconsistent     position       presented   the    risk   of\n\ninconsistent outcomes in the Supreme Court.          The Court had, in the\n\nearlier litigation, determined for itself that New Hampshire's\n\nearlier position was consistent with the evidence, id. at 753-54,\n\nand had relied on that position in approving the earlier consent\n\ndecree, id. at 752.\n\n           The contours of the judicial estoppel doctrine are not\n\nsharply defined, and there is no mechanical test for determining\n\nits applicability.     See id. at 750-51.        New Hampshire recognized\n\nthat the purpose of the doctrine is to protect the integrity of the\n\njudicial process.      Id. at 750.          The Court identified several\n\nfactors which inform the decision whether to apply the doctrine,\n\nbut also stressed these were neither \"inflexible prerequisites\" or\n\nan \"exhaustive formula.\"     Id. at 751.      The first factor is whether\n\nthe party's later position is clearly inconsistent with its earlier\n\nposition (that inconsistency is conceded in this case). The second\n\nis whether the party has succeeded in persuading a court to accept\n\nthe party's earlier position, so that judicial acceptance of an\n\ninconsistent position in a later proceeding would create the\n\nperception of inconsistent court determinations, suggesting that\n\neither   the   first   or   second    court    was   misled.     The   third\n\nconsideration is whether an unfair advantage or detriment would be\n\ncreated.   See id. at 750-51.\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\f            This       court   construed     the    New   Hampshire      decision    in\n\nAlternative System Concepts, Inc. v. Synopsys, Inc., 374 F.3d 23\n\n(1st Cir. 2004), and held that generally, judicial estoppel would\n\nnot attach1 unless:\n\n            (1)         the estopping position and the estopped\n                        position [are] directly inconsistent;\n                        and\n            (2)         the responsible party . . . succeeded\n                        in persuading a court to have accepted\n                        its prior position.\n\nId.   at   33.     This       court   also   rejected     as   a     prerequisite    to\n\napplication       of    the    doctrine      that   the    party      asserting     the\n\ninconsistent position be shown to have benefitted from the court's\n\nacceptance of the party's initial position.2                   Id.\n\n\n      1\n          The parties have not briefed the question of whether\nfederal or state law on judicial estoppel should apply when the\nunderlying case as to which estoppel is sought was a state case,\nplaintiff then pursued his civil rights action in state court, and\nthe action was then removed to federal court. We noted this issue\nin Alternative System Concepts, 374 F.3d at 32, but did not resolve\nit as state and federal law were materially the same. The parties\nhave assumed federal law applies, and so shall we. See Patriot\nCinemas, 834 F.2d at 215; see also Lowery v. Stovall, 92 F.3d 219,\n223 n.3 (4th Cir. 1996) (holding judicial estoppel is matter of\nfederal law).\n\n          We note that one commentator has questioned why, if state\nlaw would not judicially estop a second action in state court (and\nwe do not know here what Massachusetts law requires), a federal\ncourt has an interest in applying the doctrine to its own\nproceedings. See 18B Wright, Miller & Cooper, Federal Practice &\nProcedure § 4477, at 624 n.122 (2d ed. 2002).\n      2\n       Other circuits have articulated other criteria. See, e.g.,\nCarrasca v. Pomeroy, 313 F.3d 828, 835 (3d Cir. 2002) (holding that\n\"judicial estoppel can be imposed only if: '(1) the party to be\nestopped is asserting a position that is irreconcilably\ninconsistent with one he or she asserted in a prior proceeding; (2)\n\n                                          -18-\n\f           This case involves the particular branch of the doctrine\n\nthat prohibits a party from asserting historic facts (as opposed to\n\nlegal theories) that are inconsistent with historic facts the party\n\nhas   agreed   to   in   a   prior   court   proceeding.3      Of   particular\n\nsignificance is that the prior proceeding was a criminal proceeding\n\nand the facts were not found by a court or jury, but were agreed to\n\nas part of a plea bargain.       We note that although judicial estoppel\n\ndoes not usually apply to non-judicially approved settlements, cf.\n\nIn re Bankvest Capital Corp., 375 F.3d 51, 61 (1st Cir. 2004), plea\n\nagreements are certainly reviewed by a court.\n\n           As to our standard of review, the question before us is\n\npartially one of law, which we review de novo.              See United States\n\nv. Leja, 448 F.3d 86, 92 (1st Cir. 2006) (\"The district court's\n\nresolution of legal questions . . . is reviewed de novo.\");\n\nMontrose Med. Group Participating Sav. Plan v. Bulger, 243 F.3d\n\n773, 780 (3rd Cir. 2001) (de novo review of questions of law about\n\njudicial estoppel).      The standard of review is also partially one\n\nof application of law to facts and exercise of judgment by the\n\n\nthe party changed his or her position in bad faith, i.e., in a\nculpable manner threatening to the court's authority or integrity;\nand (3) the use of judicial estoppel is tailored to address the\naffront to the court's authority or integrity'\" (quoting Montrose\nMed. Group Participating Sav. Plan v. Bulger, 243 F.3d 773, 777-78\n(3d Cir. 2001))).\n      3\n          Different and very complicated issues arise when judicial\nestoppel is purported to apply to pure issues of law. See Note,\nJudicial Estoppel and Inconsistent Positions of Law Applied to Fact\nand Pure Law, 89 Cornell L. Rev. 191 (2003).\n\n                                      -19-\n\fdistrict    court,    which    we     review   for     abuse    of    discretion.\n\nAlternative Sys. Concepts, 374 F.3d at 30-31 (holding that \"the\n\nappropriate standard for reviewing a trial court's application of\n\nthe doctrine of judicial estoppel\" is abuse of discretion (emphasis\n\nadded)).\n\na.    Guilty Pleas and Judicial Estoppel\n\n            As for the question of law, the defendants argue for a\n\nrule that admissions to facts at an earlier guilty plea colloquy by\n\na    criminal   defendant    should    generally     bind    that    person    as    a\n\nplaintiff in subsequent civil rights actions.                We reject any such\n\nper se rule.      There is reason for caution.\n\n            The   seminal     case,   relied   on     by    defendants   for    the\n\nproposition that judicial estoppel should, as a rule, apply to\n\nfacts admitted during guilty pleas, is Lowery v. Stovall, 92 F.3d\n\n219 (4th Cir. 1996).        See, e.g., Johnson v. Linden City Corp., 405\n\nF.3d 1065, 1069-70 (10th Cir. 2005) (relying on Lowery).                            In\n\nLowery, a civil plaintiff who had pled guilty to maliciously\n\ncausing bodily injury to a police officer with intent to kill sued\n\nthe police for excessive use of force.               92 F.3d at 221.      In oft-\n\nquoted language, the Lowery court said:\n\n            Particularly galling is the situation where a\n            criminal convicted on his own guilty plea\n            seeks as a plaintiff in a subsequent civil\n            action to claim redress based on a repudiation\n            of the confession. The effrontery or, as some\n            might say it, chutzpah, is too much to take.\n            There certainly should be an estoppel in such\n            a case.\n\n                                       -20-\n\f92 F.3d at 225 (quoting Hazard, Revisiting the Second Restatement\n\nof Judgments: Issue Preclusion and Related Problems, 66 Cornell L.\n\nRev. 564, 578 (1981)).\n\n              This language could be taken to mean that any defendant\n\nwho pleads guilty and in doing so admits to certain facts is thus\n\nplaying \"fast and loose\" if he takes an inconsistent position\n\nlater, and so he should be judicially estopped.               That is not our\n\nview.      If \"chutzpah\" alone justified judicial estoppel, a great\n\nmany claims would be estopped.\n\n              Courts, whether on appeal, motion for new trial, or\n\npetition for post-conviction or collateral relief, commonly address\n\ncontentions that a defendant should not be bound by facts stated in\n\na   plea    agreement.       That   being    so,    the   mere   assertion   of\n\ninconsistent facts from those admitted in a plea does not strike us\n\nas inherently impugning the integrity of the judicial process.\n\nJudicial estoppel, for example, is not applicable to bar a criminal\n\ndefendant from later asserting a claim based on innocence either on\n\ndirect appeal or on habeas corpus, even when such a claim rests on\n\nfacts that contradict the criminal defendant's in-court and sworn\n\nrepresentations.       See Morris v. California, 966 F.2d 448, 453-54\n\n(9th Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 831 (1992).\n\n              At least two other concerns arise in this setting with\n\nrespect to whether there is any impugning of judicial integrity.\n\nThe   first    is   that   guilty   pleas    do   not   necessarily   establish\n\n                                      -21-\n\fabsolute historic facts; what is stated in a plea arrangement is an\n\nagreed-upon   version     of   the     facts    that,    while   it   avoids\n\nmisrepresentation, is sufficient to support the entry of the plea.\n\nIt is not uncommon for the statement of those facts to be shaped by\n\nbargaining between the parties.        For example, in United States v.\n\nYeje-Cabrera, 430 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2005), this court discussed\n\nextensively the issue of fact bargaining in guilty pleas; we\n\ndescribed fact bargaining as an inevitable consequence of the\n\nprocess of plea bargaining.     Id. at 27-28.        Plea bargains benefit\n\nboth the prosecution and the defense: the defendant is motivated to\n\nbargain to get lenient treatment, and the prosecution gains from\n\nbargains by saving resources and achieving efficient outcomes.\n\nIndeed, it may be the later civil rights plaintiff who seeks to\n\napply judicial estoppel against the prosecution for statements\n\nagreed to in plea agreements.        Cf. United States v. Levasseur, 846\n\nF.2d 786, 790-95 (1st Cir. 1986) (reversing district court's\n\napplication of judicial estoppel to bar government from alleging\n\ncertain crimes as RICO violations); cf. also United States v.\n\nChristian, 342 F.3d 744, 748 (7th Cir. 2003) (rejecting judicial\n\nestoppel of government); Young v. Dept. of Justice, 882 F.2d 633,\n\n639-40 (2d Cir. 1989) (considering whether judicial estoppel should\n\napply   against   the   government,    albeit   in   a   non-plea-agreement\n\nscenario).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -22-\n\f              Secondly, the question of judicial \"acceptance\" of a\n\nguilty plea may turn on the particulars of a given case.                  All facts\n\nrecited during the plea colloquy are not necessarily \"accepted\" by\n\na judge.      Mass. R. Crim. P. 12(c)(5)(A), for example, precludes a\n\njudge from accepting a plea of guilty \"unless [he] is satisfied\n\nthat there is a factual basis for the charge.\"                 Significantly, the\n\nrule   also    provides    that     \"[t]he    failure     of   the   defendant    to\n\nacknowledge all of the elements of the factual basis shall not\n\npreclude a judge from accepting a guilty plea.\"                 The federal rule\n\ngenerally is that the facts recited \"may prove more than what is\n\ncharged, but not less.\"         Christian, 342 F.3d at 748 (citing United\n\nStates v. Martin, 287 F.3d 609, 621 (7th Cir. 2002)).                     Here, for\n\nexample, Thore argues that the plea colloquy did not need to recite\n\nthat officer Dibara was in fear for his life when he shot, in order\n\nto establish that Thore was guilty of assault and battery with a\n\ndangerous weapon, by automobile.             Indeed, viewing the state crime\n\nas a general intent crime, all that was needed was that the\n\nofficers      were   touched   by    his   car   and    the    touching    was   not\n\naccidental, not that Thore intended to injure the officers.\n\n              The    Supreme   Court   has,    in   New   Hampshire,      tied   the\n\njudicial-acceptance factor to the risk of inconsistent decisions\n\nfrom two courts.        532 U.S. at 750-51.         In this context -- guilty\n\npleas followed by § 1983 actions -- the Heck doctrine will cause\n\n\n\n\n                                       -23-\n\fdismissal of any § 1983 case which could undermine the conviction.4\n\nBut to say his claim may survive Heck is not to say that judicial\n\nestoppel can play no role as to facts admitted at a plea colloquy.\n\nJudicial estoppel is, after all, a doctrine of equity.\n\n           Another rationale -- avoidance of misleading the court --\n\nhas been articulated for judicial estoppel.     In our view, it is\n\nwrong to think that either the defendant or the government has\n\nnecessarily misled or made an intentional misrepresentation5 to the\n\ncourt that accepted the plea when a party tries to assert a\n\npartially inconsistent version of the facts in a later civil rights\n\naction.6   And it would be equally wrong to use the judicial\n\nestoppel doctrine automatically to foreclose genuine efforts to\n\ndemonstrate the truth.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n          But see Johnson, 405 F.3d at 1069-70 (analyzing issue of\ninconsistency between state conviction and federal civil rights\ncase under judicial estoppel, not Heck).\n     5\n          Of course, no relief from judicial estoppel usually is\navailable to a party who has undermined the integrity of the\njudicial system by intentionally misrepresenting historic facts.\nThore argues the converse: that the standard should be that he\nshould not be held to his earlier statement until it is shown that\nhe intentionally misled the earlier court, and there is no\nintentional misrepresentation at issue here.           But, under\nAlternative System Concepts, a party is not automatically excused\nfrom judicial estoppel if the earlier statement was made in good\nfaith. 374 F.3d at 35.\n     6\n          As to legal theories, the Federal Rules themselves permit\npleading of inconsistent theories in a single action. See Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 8(e)(2).\n\n                                -24-\n\f               Circuit courts have been sensitive to this problem.                  In\n\nCarrasca v. Pomeroy, 313 F.3d 828 (3rd Cir. 2002), the plaintiffs,\n\nwho were of Hispanic descent, brought a racial profiling action\n\nagainst park officials alleging that the officials had applied\n\nswimming       regulations     differentially      between       Hispanic   and   non-\n\nHispanic visitors.           Id. at 830, 832.           Plaintiffs had all been\n\narrested for use of the lake and had pled guilty to state charges\n\n(though they later contended that at least one of the plaintiffs\n\nhad not actually broken the regulations).                 Id.    The district court\n\ngranted summary judgment in favor of the park officials, id. at\n\n830,     and    the    court    of     appeals    reversed       and   remanded    for\n\nreconsideration of the application of judicial estoppel, id. at\n\n835.     In doing so, it relied on statements in Haring v. Prosise,\n\n462 U.S. 306, 318-19 (1983), that there are a number of reasons why\n\na defendant might choose to plead guilty.                  Carrasca, 313 F.3d at\n\n835;   see      also   Haring,       462   U.S.   at    318-19    (noting   that    \"a\n\ndefendant's decision to plead guilty may have any number of other\n\nmotivations,\" including shock, avoidance of financial and emotional\n\ncost, and hope for a lesser sentence).                 Accordingly, we reject the\n\nnotion    that    judicial     estoppel      automatically       applies    to    facts\n\nadmitted during guilty pleas.\n\nb.   Application of Doctrine to this Case\n\n               Having rejected any per se rule that judicial estoppel\n\nalways applies or never applies to facts admitted during a guilty\n\n\n                                           -25-\n\fplea, we turn to the question of application of the doctrine to the\n\nparticular facts of the case.            Our review is for whether the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion in applying estoppel here.\n\nAlternative Sys. Concepts, 374 F.3d at 30-31.\n\n            We note again that Thore has conceded that his current\n\nposition is directly inconsistent with facts admitted at his plea\n\ncolloquy.      Furthermore, based on the transcript of Thore's plea\n\ncolloquy, it was reasonable for the district court to conclude that\n\nthere was sufficient acceptance by the state court of the facts\n\npreviously admitted to by Thore.\n\n            Thore nevertheless attempts to fit his case into well-\n\nrecognized exceptions to judicial estoppel.           The Supreme Court has\n\nnoted   that    a   later   inconsistent     assertion      of    fact    will    not\n\nnecessarily     give    rise   to   judicial     estoppel    if    a     reasonable\n\njustification can be offered for a change in positions.                    See New\n\nHampshire, 532 U.S. at 753, 755 (noting that inadvertence or\n\nmistake may make application of judicial estoppel inappropriate,\n\nand   referencing      \"considerations      of   equity\"    in    deciding       that\n\njudicial estoppel was appropriate in that case).\n\n            The classic case of justification is \"when a party's\n\nprior position was based on inadvertence or mistake.\"                    Id. at 753\n\n(quoting John S. Clark Co. v. Faggert & Frieden, P.C., 65 F.3d 26,\n\n29 (4th Cir. 1995)) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also 18\n\nMoore's Federal Practice, supra, § 134.33[2], at 134-74 (noting\n\n\n                                     -26-\n\fthat some courts require bad faith in order for judicial estoppel\n\nto   apply).    For   example,   in    Alternative     System   Concepts     we\n\nrecognized an exception may be available \"if . . . the new,\n\ninconsistent position is the product of information neither known\n\nnor readily available to [a party] at the time the initial position\n\nwas taken.\"     374 F.3d at 35; accord Intergen N.V. v. Grina, 344\n\nF.3d 134, 144 (1st Cir. 2003) (rejecting \"a rule that unduly\n\ninhibits a plaintiff from appropriately adjusting its complaint\n\neither to correct errors or to accommodate facts learned during\n\npretrial discovery\").\n\n           In   a   somewhat   analogous      case,   Cleveland   v.    Policy\n\nManagement Systems Corp., 526 U.S. 795 (1999), the Supreme Court\n\naddressed the question of whether a party's claim that she was\n\ntotally disabled for SSI purposes judicially estopped her from\n\nproving an essential element of her Americans with Disabilities Act\n\nclaim that she could perform the essential functions of her job (at\n\nleast with reasonable accommodation).           The opinion held that the\n\ndistrict   court    should   require    sufficient     explanation     of   any\n\napparent   inconsistency.      Id.     at   806-07.    While    that   opinion\n\naddressed conflicts as to legal conclusions drawn from facts, and\n\nspecifically distinguished \"purely factual contradictions,\" id. at\n\n\n\n\n                                     -27-\n\f807, we think the model of examining the defendant's reasons for\n\njustification of the inconsistency is apt.7\n\n            Thore argues that his initial agreement to the facts\n\nstated at the guilty plea colloquy should not bind him because of\n\nhis own debilitated condition after the shooting and because he was\n\ninduced to agree to those facts by fraud8 on the part of the police\n\nin their representations to him about what Laro said.               Neither\n\nargument is enough here to establish any abuse of discretion in the\n\ndistrict court's ruling.\n\n            Thore's argument that he truly does not recall the event\n\nbecause he was shot and so cannot be held to have personally\n\nremembered    the   details   he    agreed   with   at   the   colloquy   is\n\ndisingenuous.    No evidence at all supports this theory.         Even now\n\nhe does not argue that at the time of the plea colloquy, almost\n\nfour months after the shooting, he did not recall the events\n\nleading up to the shooting.        At most, he has said he did not recall\n\nwhat happened after he was shot and before he awakened in a\n\nhospital.    There is no evidence he was not competent at the time of\n\n\n     7\n          Similarly, where a witness gives a clear and unambiguous\nanswer, he may not defeat summary judgment with a contradictory\naffidavit unless he gives a satisfactory explanation of why the\ntestimony has changed. Colantuoni v. Alfred Calcagni & Sons, Inc.,\n44 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 1994).\n     8\n          See Jaffe v. Accredited Sur. and Cas. Co., Inc., 294 F.3d\n584, 595 n.7 (4th Cir. 2002) (holding that judicial estoppel does\nnot apply when a party's assertedly inconsistent positions stem\nfrom reliance on statements made to the court by an opponent which\nlater prove to be untrue).\n\n                                     -28-\n\fthe plea.     He has offered no justification for his own switch in\n\nposition between the plea bargain and now on what happened before\n\nhe was shot.    Laro's version of the facts is irrelevant to Thore's\n\nown agreement with the recited facts.\n\n            There is also no explanation for why Thore did not\n\nattempt to talk to Laro before Thore pled guilty.             That Thore did\n\nnot think of it at the time is no more a justification than New\n\nHampshire's argument that it should be excused because it did\n\ninadequate research into the historical facts during the first\n\nproceeding.      Whatever   Laro   had   to   say,   this   was   information\n\navailable to Thore at the time of his plea.\n\n            As for Thore's attempt to assert reliance on the police\n\naccounts of Laro's interview, which Thore now says were fraud, a\n\ndistrict    court   could   consider     both   that    the   reliance    was\n\nunreasonable and the evidence of fraud very weak.\n\n            There are many explanations for Laro's reversal other\n\nthan that the police had engaged in a conspiracy and attributed\n\nfalse statements to Laro in their reports.             The contemporaneous\n\nstatements made to the police were signed by Laro at the time as\n\naccurate statements of the events.        That he now does not have the\n\nsame memory does not establish there was fraud or deception worked\n\non Thore or on the state criminal court by the police.9                   The\n\n\n     9\n          Thore also offered a statement from an accident\nreconstruction witness that concludes that \"the vehicular evidence\nnow available to us suggests the police were the aggressors in this\n\n                                   -29-\n\freports of the police officers, Thore's girlfriend, and the third-\n\nparty witness at the time all support exactly the facts recited to\n\nthe state court in the plea colloquy.10\n\n            Nor was it an abuse of discretion for the district court\n\nto   conclude   that   the   equities   supported   application    of   the\n\ndoctrine.    There is little to support the plaintiff's claim of\n\nfraud, and the defendants reasonably thought that the statements\n\nmade in the plea colloquy -- that Thore's actions had placed the\n\nofficers in fear of their lives -- protected them from exactly this\n\nlawsuit.\n\n            While   undoubtedly    cases   exist    in   which    criminal\n\ndefendants should not be held to the statements they made at the\n\ntime they pled guilty in a subsequent civil rights action, the\n\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in deciding this was\n\nnot one of those cases.\n\n            We affirm the entry of judgment for defendants.         Costs\n\nare awarded to defendants.\n\n\n\n\ncase.\" But that conclusion rests on Laro's testimony that Thore\ndid not hit any police cars.\n      10\n          As the defendant state officers point out, there are\nadditional equitable reasons to apply the estoppel doctrine.\nAlthough Thore's arguments on estoppel are largely based on the\ntruck driver's deposition, Thore filed the lawsuit a year before\nthe truck driver made any such statements.\n\n                                   -30-\n\f",

This suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n\nasserting    excessive   force   and   conspiracy   claims   raises   two\n\ninteresting issues not directly addressed before by this circuit.\n\nThe first is whether the Supreme Court's decision in Heck v.\n\nHumphrey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117864\"><a href=\"/opinion/117864/heck-v-humphrey/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">477</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 486-87 (1994), bars the civil rights claim\n\nasserting excessive force brought by plaintiff Thore, who earlier\n\npled guilty to state criminal charges, arising from the same event,\n\nof assault with a dangerous weapon on police officers.        The second\n\nissue is whether Thore is judicially estopped from asserting facts\n\ninconsistent with the facts to which Thore agreed during the plea\n\ncolloquy.    Thore admits that if he is judicially estopped from\n\nasserting facts inconsistent with the plea colloquy, then his\n\nexcessive force claim cannot succeed.\n\n            On February 8, 2002, Charles Thore pled guilty in state\n\ncourt to several charges, including three counts of assault and\n\nbattery with a dangerous weapon (to wit, a car) on three police\n\nofficers, one count of assault and battery, one count of operating\n\na motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol, one count of\n\noperating after suspension, and one count of operating to endanger.\n\nThe charges stemmed from his drunken driving encounter with police\n\nofficers on October 17, 2001, during which Thore was shot in the\n\nneck by Fitchburg police officer Jeffrey Howe. Six other Fitchburg\n\npolice officers and three Massachusetts state police detectives\n\nalso were involved.\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\f            During his plea colloquy, Thore, who was represented by\n\ncounsel, said that he agreed with an account of the facts stated by\n\nthe prosecution.     Thore knowingly and voluntarily pled guilty.   As\n\na result of his plea bargain, Thore received the benefit of a joint\n\nsentencing recommendation of a four-year sentence of imprisonment,\n\nwhich was accepted by the court.        He avoided a potential ten-to-\n\ntwelve-year sentence, and had the benefit of dismissal of other\n\ncharges.\n\n            In August 2003, Thore brought an action in state superior\n\ncourt under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the officers; the case was\n\nremoved to federal court.       His original complaint alleged that\n\nOfficer Howe had used excessive force in shooting him and had\n\nengaged in assault and battery.      After discovery, he amended his\n\ncomplaint in November 2004, adding claims that six Fitchburg police\n\nofficers,    three   Massachusetts   State   Police   detectives   (who\n\ninvestigated Officer Howe's use of force), and Officer Howe had all\n\nconspired to cover up the circumstances of the shooting and had\n\nmaliciously abused process.\n\n            The district court entered summary judgment for all\n\ndefendants in a thoughtful opinion.          The court held that the\n\ndoctrine of judicial estoppel barred Thore from asserting facts\n\ninconsistent with the facts to which he admitted during his plea\n\ncolloquy in the Worcester Superior Court.       As a result, the court\n\nreasoned, Thore's § 1983 excessive force and state law assault and\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fbattery    claims    failed      to    overcome      Officer   Howe's    qualified\n\nimmunity.     The district court also held that Heck v. Humphrey\n\nbarred assertion of the § 1983 malicious abuse of process and\n\nconspiracy claims against all defendants and that, in any event, no\n\nclaim was stated under § 1983 as to either malicious abuse of\n\nprocess or conspiracy.        The court did not reach the Heck issue as\n\nto the excessive force claim.\n\n            Thore appeals, arguing that judicial estoppel should not\n\napply to bar him from asserting inconsistent facts because he now\n\nhas evidence that some of the facts asserted at the plea colloquy\n\nare not true.       He also argues that Heck v. Humphrey does not bar\n\nhim from asserting any of his claims.               He concedes that if judicial\n\nestoppel applies, then the district court was correct in entering\n\njudgment for Officer Howe on the excessive force claim.                    He does\n\nnot appeal the dismissal of the abuse of process claim.\n\n                                         I.\n\n            Thore pled guilty to three counts of assault and battery\n\nwith a deadly weapon (a car), see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265 § 15A(b),\n\nas well as other crimes.              Under Massachusetts law, assault and\n\nbattery may be proven using two alternate theories.                      Under the\n\nfirst, an assault and battery is \"the intentional and unjustified\n\nuse   of   force    upon   the    person       of   another,   however    slight.\"\n\nCommonwealth v.

The John Fitch Highway is a\n           public way in the city of Fitchburg. The blue\n           Volkswag[e]n almost struck the passenger side\n           of the vehicle occupied by Sergeant Fossa.\n           Both vehicles stopped.     The operator of the\n           blue    Volkswag[e]n,   Charles    Thore,   the\n           defendant, started to get out of the vehicle\n           he was operating and began yelling at Sergeant\n           Fossa. Sergeant Fossa observed that Mr. Thore\n           appeared to be having a confrontation with a\n           female passenger in his vehicle. The female\n           passenger was later identified as Jessilyn\n           Chabot.     Mr. Thore got back in the blue\n           Volkswag[e]n and began to drive away wildly,\n           passing cars in the turn-only lanes of the\n           John Fitch Highway. Sergeant Fossa reported\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fthe blue Volkswag[e]n to the Fitchburg police\ndepartment.\n\n       Sergeant John Kell[e]y and Officer\nMatthew Dibara responded to the John Fitch\nHighway. Sergeant Fossa pointed out the blue\nVolkswag[e]n to the responding Fitchburg\nofficers. Sergeant Fossa observed Mr. Thore\nholding Miss Chabot in a headlock, and he\nappeared to be hitting and/or struggling with\nMiss Chabot.   Miss Chabot reported that Mr.\nThore was choking her and that he slapped her\nin the face twice because she was breaking up\nwith him. Miss Chabot was pregnant with Mr.\nThore's child at the time.\n\n       Officer Dibara approached the blue\nVolkswag[e]n and instructed Mr. Thore to\nplease turn off the engine and step from the\nvehicle.    Mr. Thore did not comply and\neventually placed the vehicle in reverse and\naccelerated. Officer Dibara reached into an\nopen window and attempted to stop the blue\nVolkswag[e]n out of concern for the safety of\nMiss Chabot.    Officer Dibara held onto Mr.\nThore as he was dragged somewhat and was\nforced to run at times to keep pace with the\nvehicle.    Officer Dibara disengaged after\nabout 25 feet, fearing for his life. At times\nthroughout the incident the blue Volkswag[e]n\noperated by Mr. Thore came into contact with\nOfficer Dibara.\n\n       Mr. Thore attempted to flee through the\nparking lot but was headed off by Sergeant\nKell[e]y and Fitchburg police officer Jeffrey\nHowe, who were operating separate police\ncruisers.   Mr. Thore began to strike both\ncruisers operated by Sergeant Kell[e]y and\nOfficer Howe with the blue Volkswag[e]n.\n\n       At one point Officer Dibara ordered Mr.\nThore to stop at gunpoint. Mr. Thore looked\nat Officer Dibara and stated, \"Fucking shoot\nme.\" Officer Dibara re-holstered his weapon\nand attempted to pull Mr. Thore from the\nvehicle. Mr. Thore again accelerated, broke\nfree, and struck Officer Howe's cruiser on the\n\n                     -6-\n\f           driver's door, pushing Officer Howe and his\n           cruiser into a tractor trailer truck and\n           nearly striking Officer Dibara.        Officer\n           Dibara heard Mr. Thore's vehicle revving as\n           Mr. Thore was apparently attempting to move\n           the blue Volkswag[e]n in an unknown direction.\n           Fearing for his life, and that of Officer\n           Dibara[], Officer Howe fired three shots from\n           his firearm at this point. One round struck\n           Mr. Thore in the neck.\n\nThis is a matter of record; there is no disagreement that Thore\n\nagreed to these facts.\n\n           Thore argues that the facts to which he admitted are not\n\ntrue as to whether the officers were endangered or in fear for\n\ntheir lives.   He argues he can prove this through the testimony of\n\na disinterested third-party witness, one Jon Laro, the truck driver\n\nunder whose truck Officer Howe's cruiser was pushed.              Laro, at\n\ndeposition in this case, gave a markedly different version of the\n\nevents that contradicted those (a) recited in the plea colloquy and\n\n(b)   contained   in   the   two   statements   the   police   recorded   on\n\ninterviewing Laro, which Laro signed shortly after the event (and\n\nwhich fully supported the facts recited at the colloquy).                 At\n\ndeposition, Laro said that Thore's car, a blue Volkswagen, had not\n\nstruck the police cars, but that the police cars had repeatedly\n\nstruck Thore's car and had him boxed in so his car could not move.\n\nThe witness stated the officers were never placed in danger by\n\nThore and that Officer Howe had no reason to shoot Thore:\n\n           They really had him stopped, pinned down when\n           they had him up against that building to be\n           honest with you. To me, I don't know, maybe\n\n                                     -7-\n\f          if I was a police officer I think I would have\n          just shot the guy's tires.     He ain't going\n          nowhere, you know, I don't know.     I didn't\n          really feel there was a need to shoot the kid\n          let's put it that way. I know the kid wasn't\n          right but they weren't right and two wrongs\n          don't make a right and that's what happened\n          here.\n\n          By contrast, the typed notes of Detective Kymalainen's\n\ninterview with Laro on October 17, 2001 present a different picture\n\nof what Laro saw:\n\n          Q.   [Police] After the car hit cruiser five\n          what did it do?\n          A. [Laro] The car's engine revved and he went\n          flying in reverse away from the police car, he\n          turned hard right in reverse and backed into a\n          parked car about fifteen feet maybe. He was\n          out of control backing up, I thought for sure\n          he was going to hit one of the cops that was\n          near his car.\n          Q. Where were the police officers?\n          A. I think there were two officers, there may\n          have been more, but I remember they ran past\n          my tractor towards the blue car after it\n          struck cruiser five. There were a couple of\n          seconds were [sic] the car was stopped after\n          it hit car five. The cops ran to the car, I\n          saw them with their guns out, when they got\n          near the car they pointed their guns at him\n          and yelled at the guy to get out of the car.\n          Those officers yelled at the man to get out,\n          they were very loud.     I heard the officer\n          shout several times to get out of the car.\n          The guy didn't get out, he just jammed it in\n          reverse and went backwards, it was lucky\n          nobody didn't get hit because he almost ran\n          them over.\n          . . .\n          Q. Prior to the shots what did you think the\n          operator of the blue car was going to do after\n          it struck the parked car?\n          A. It was going to try and get away again,\n          there was nothing stopping this guy, he was\n\n\n                               -8-\n\f              like a lunatic. I really thought the guy was\n              going to run those officers over.\n\nAs noted, Laro signed the statement on or about October 17, 2001.\n\nThis   typed    interview   is    entirely     consistent   with    handwritten\n\ninterview notes, which Laro also signed and initialed.                        Laro\n\ntestified he does recall being interviewed, but denied saying a\n\nnumber of things that are recorded in the notes.             Thore maintains\n\nthe police forged the notes as part of a cover up.\n\n              Thore argues that until Laro's deposition, he had simply\n\nrelied on the reports the police had given him as to Laro's account\n\nof the events and that this induced him to plead guilty.                   He says\n\nthat had he known Laro's true account, he would not have pled\n\nguilty or admitted to certain facts.           He points out that he has no\n\nmemory   of    events   after    being    shot.    He   argues     there    was   a\n\nconspiracy by the Fitchburg and state police to misstate the\n\nevidence of the third-party witness, and thus create, after the\n\nfact, a justification for the shooting.\n\n              Thore also argues he should be permitted to prove that\n\nthe police knew that he was not armed (because his girlfriend told\n\nthem), that his car was boxed in by the cruisers and so his own car\n\ncould not move or harm the officers, and that the officers were\n\nnever endangered.       Based on those facts, he argues that under the\n\nstandards of Brosseau v. Haugen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137736\"><a href=\"/opinion/137736/brosseau-v-haugen/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2004), and Graham v.\n\nConnor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112257\"><a href=\"/opinion/112257/graham-v-connor/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">386</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1989), it was objectively unreasonable for an\n\nofficer to shoot him.\n\n                                         -9-\n\f                                     II.\n\n           The    order   appealed   from   grants   summary   judgment   to\n\ndefendants.

At\n\nissue are several matters which are committed to the district\n\ncourt, not a jury, in the first instance.        Whether the case states\n\na viable § 1983 claim in the first place and whether the case\n\nstates a viable § 1983 claim in light of Heck are issues of law for\n\nthe court.       Similarly, whether to apply the judicial estoppel\n\ndoctrine is also an issue for the court, not the jury, to decide.\n\nSee New Hampshire v. Maine, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118435\"><a href=\"/opinion/118435/new-hampshire-v-maine/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">742</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 750 (2001) (\"[J]udicial\n\nestoppel 'is an equitable doctrine invoked by a court at its\n\ndiscretion.'\"     (quoting Russell v.

In Landrigan, we \"assume[d],\n\nwithout deciding, that [a claim alleging deprivation of a § 1983\n\nright of action], sufficiently advanced, could have amounted to an\n\nactionable deprivation of federally protected rights.\" 628 F.2d at\n\n742.

The Excessive Force Claim\n\n             Defendant Howe argues that Heck v. Humphrey bars Thore's\n\n§ 1983 claim for excessive force.            He also argues that the doctrine\n\nof judicial estoppel justifies the district court's entry of\n\nsummary judgment in his favor.\n\n1.   The Heck v. Humphrey Rule\n\n             In Heck v. Humphrey, the Supreme Court held that where a\n\n§ 1983 suit for damages would \"necessarily imply\" the invalidity of\n\nan inmate's conviction, or \"necessarily imply\" the invalidity of\n\nthe length of any inmate's sentence, such a claim is not cognizable\n\nunder   §   1983   unless     and    until    the   inmate   obtains      favorable\n\nresolution of a challenge to his conviction.                  Heck, 512 U.S. at\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\f487.    As    a    result,     the     district    court    must   consider    the\n\nrelationship between the § 1983 claim and the conviction, including\n\nasking whether the plaintiff could prevail only by \"negat[ing] an\n\nelement of the offense of which he [was] convicted.\"                  Id. at 486\n\nn.6.   Only       if   a   \"judgment    in   favor   of    the   plaintiff    would\n\nnecessarily imply the invalidity of the conviction or sentence\"\n\ndoes the court go on to ask whether that conviction or sentence has\n\nin fact been invalidated.         Id. at 487.\n\n          Thore argues that his claim does not necessarily imply\n\nthe invalidity of his conviction.              The Supreme Court has, in many\n\ncivil rights actions, including in Heck, held that a § 1983 claim\n\nis stated where there is no necessary implication of the invalidity\n\nof the conviction.

The first is\n\nthat he was not guilty of assault at all, and so Officer Howe's use\n\nof force was excessive.       That theory is plainly barred by Heck.\n\n             The more modest second theory is that his excessive force\n\nclaim need not impugn his convictions for assault and battery with\n\na dangerous weapon in order to establish that Officer Howe used\n\nexcessive force.       Thore says that even if his car had previously\n\nhit the cruisers and brushed Officer Dibara's body, by the time of\n\nthe shooting, Thore was stationary in a car, boxed in with nowhere\n\nto go, and posed no threat to the officers, who had been told that\n\nhe had no gun.\n\n             Just as it is true that a § 1983 excessive force claim\n\nafter an assault conviction is not necessarily barred by Heck, it\n\nis also true that it is not necessarily free from Heck.                     The\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fexcessive force claim and the conviction may be so interrelated\n\nfactually as to bar the § 1983 claim.      See, e.g., Cunningham v.\n\nGates, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">312</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1148</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1154-55 (9th Cir. 2002).\n\n            Officer Howe argues, relying on Cunningham, that this is\n\nsuch a case: that Thore's third conviction for assault and battery\n\nwith a dangerous weapon was based on his refusal to obey commands\n\nto get out of his car, and on his gunning his engine to start to\n\nget away.    In doing so, he endangered the two officers:   Officer\n\nDibara on foot and Officer Howe in his cruiser.      We cannot tell\n\nfrom the record before us whether this is so.\n\n            While we conclude that Heck does not automatically bar\n\nconsideration of an excessive force claim by an individual who has\n\nbeen convicted of assault, the record before us does not permit a\n\ndetermination of the requisite relatedness.    Accordingly, we move\n\non to consider whether Thore is barred by judicial estoppel from\n\ndenying the facts he admitted in the plea colloquy.\n\n2.   Judicial Estoppel\n\n            We provide some background on the judicial estoppel\n\ndoctrine.    Before the Supreme Court addressed the use of judicial\n\nestoppel doctrine in federal courts, this court had permitted\n\ninvocation of the doctrine.    See, e.g., Patriot Cinemas, Inc. v.\n\nGen. Cinema Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"498115\"><a href=\"/opinion/498115/patriot-cinemas-inc-v-general-cinema-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">834</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">208</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 215 (1st Cir. 1987) (binding party\n\nto its prior representation that it would not pursue a claim).\n\n\n\n\n                                -15-\n\f            In New Hampshire v. Maine, the Supreme Court held that\n\njudicial estoppel could be utilized in the federal courts.                   532\n\nU.S. at 756.       The court defined judicial estoppel as a doctrine\n\nwhich \"generally prevents a party from prevailing in one phase of\n\na case on an argument and then relying on a contradictory argument\n\nto prevail in another phase.\"            New Hampshire, 532 U.S. at 749\n\n(quoting    Pegram    v.

Unlike the doctrine of issue\n\npreclusion, judicial estoppel does not require that the issue have\n\nbeen actually litigated in the prior proceeding. Id. at 748-49; 18\n\nMoore's Federal Practice § 134.30, at 134-69 (3d ed. 2005).\n\n            In New Hampshire, the Court recognized that, although New\n\nHampshire    was     equitably   barred       from   asserting     a     position\n\n(concerning a river boundary) contrary to a position it had taken\n\nin earlier litigation which had culminated in a consent decree,\n\njudicial estoppel might be inappropriate when a party's prior\n\nposition was based on inadvertence or mistake.              New Hampshire, 532\n\nU.S. at 753.       But the Court rejected New Hampshire's \"mistake\"\n\nargument that it had failed to do searching historic research\n\nearlier, and that if New Hampshire had known then what it knew now,\n\nit would not have entered into the consent decree.              Id. at 753-54.\n\nThe Court noted that New Hampshire had had every incentive to do\n\nthat research earlier.       Id. at 754.      The Court also noted that the\n\nstate's inconsistent position would give New Hampshire an advantage\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\fat Maine's expense.    Id. at 755.     Furthermore, it is clear that New\n\nHampshire's    inconsistent     position       presented   the    risk   of\n\ninconsistent outcomes in the Supreme Court.          The Court had, in the\n\nearlier litigation, determined for itself that New Hampshire's\n\nearlier position was consistent with the evidence, id. at 753-54,\n\nand had relied on that position in approving the earlier consent\n\ndecree, id. at 752.\n\n           The contours of the judicial estoppel doctrine are not\n\nsharply defined, and there is no mechanical test for determining\n\nits applicability.     See id. at 750-51.        New Hampshire recognized\n\nthat the purpose of the doctrine is to protect the integrity of the\n\njudicial process.      Id. at 750.          The Court identified several\n\nfactors which inform the decision whether to apply the doctrine,\n\nbut also stressed these were neither \"inflexible prerequisites\" or\n\nan \"exhaustive formula.\"     Id. at 751.      The first factor is whether\n\nthe party's later position is clearly inconsistent with its earlier\n\nposition (that inconsistency is conceded in this case). The second\n\nis whether the party has succeeded in persuading a court to accept\n\nthe party's earlier position, so that judicial acceptance of an\n\ninconsistent position in a later proceeding would create the\n\nperception of inconsistent court determinations, suggesting that\n\neither   the   first   or   second    court    was   misled.     The   third\n\nconsideration is whether an unfair advantage or detriment would be\n\ncreated.

In\n\nLowery, a civil plaintiff who had pled guilty to maliciously\n\ncausing bodily injury to a police officer with intent to kill sued\n\nthe police for excessive use of force.               92 F.3d at 221.      In oft-\n\nquoted language, the Lowery court said:\n\n            Particularly galling is the situation where a\n            criminal convicted on his own guilty plea\n            seeks as a plaintiff in a subsequent civil\n            action to claim redress based on a repudiation\n            of the confession. The effrontery or, as some\n            might say it, chutzpah, is too much to take.\n            There certainly should be an estoppel in such\n            a case.\n\n                                       -20-\n\f92 F.3d at 225 (quoting Hazard, Revisiting the Second Restatement\n\nof Judgments: Issue Preclusion and Related Problems, 66 Cornell L.\n\nRev. 564, 578 (1981)).\n\n              This language could be taken to mean that any defendant\n\nwho pleads guilty and in doing so admits to certain facts is thus\n\nplaying \"fast and loose\" if he takes an inconsistent position\n\nlater, and so he should be judicially estopped.               That is not our\n\nview.      If \"chutzpah\" alone justified judicial estoppel, a great\n\nmany claims would be estopped.\n\n              Courts, whether on appeal, motion for new trial, or\n\npetition for post-conviction or collateral relief, commonly address\n\ncontentions that a defendant should not be bound by facts stated in\n\na   plea    agreement.       That   being    so,    the   mere   assertion   of\n\ninconsistent facts from those admitted in a plea does not strike us\n\nas inherently impugning the integrity of the judicial process.\n\nJudicial estoppel, for example, is not applicable to bar a criminal\n\ndefendant from later asserting a claim based on innocence either on\n\ndirect appeal or on habeas corpus, even when such a claim rests on\n\nfacts that contradict the criminal defendant's in-court and sworn\n\nrepresentations.

All facts\n\nrecited during the plea colloquy are not necessarily \"accepted\" by\n\na judge.      Mass. R. Crim.

Here, for\n\nexample, Thore argues that the plea colloquy did not need to recite\n\nthat officer Dibara was in fear for his life when he shot, in order\n\nto establish that Thore was guilty of assault and battery with a\n\ndangerous weapon, by automobile.             Indeed, viewing the state crime\n\nas a general intent crime, all that was needed was that the\n\nofficers      were   touched   by    his   car   and    the    touching    was   not\n\naccidental, not that Thore intended to injure the officers.\n\n              The    Supreme   Court   has,    in   New   Hampshire,      tied   the\n\njudicial-acceptance factor to the risk of inconsistent decisions\n\nfrom two courts.        532 U.S. at 750-51.         In this context -- guilty\n\npleas followed by § 1983 actions -- the Heck doctrine will cause\n\n\n\n\n                                       -23-\n\fdismissal of any § 1983 case which could undermine the conviction.4\n\nBut to say his claim may survive Heck is not to say that judicial\n\nestoppel can play no role as to facts admitted at a plea colloquy.\n\nJudicial estoppel is, after all, a doctrine of equity.\n\n           Another rationale -- avoidance of misleading the court --\n\nhas been articulated for judicial estoppel.     In our view, it is\n\nwrong to think that either the defendant or the government has\n\nnecessarily misled or made an intentional misrepresentation5 to the\n\ncourt that accepted the plea when a party tries to assert a\n\npartially inconsistent version of the facts in a later civil rights\n\naction.6   And it would be equally wrong to use the judicial\n\nestoppel doctrine automatically to foreclose genuine efforts to\n\ndemonstrate the truth.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n          But see Johnson, 405 F.3d at 1069-70 (analyzing issue of\ninconsistency between state conviction and federal civil rights\ncase under judicial estoppel, not Heck).\n     5\n          Of course, no relief from judicial estoppel usually is\navailable to a party who has undermined the integrity of the\njudicial system by intentionally misrepresenting historic facts.\nThore argues the converse: that the standard should be that he\nshould not be held to his earlier statement until it is shown that\nhe intentionally misled the earlier court, and there is no\nintentional misrepresentation at issue here.           But, under\nAlternative System Concepts, a party is not automatically excused\nfrom judicial estoppel if the earlier statement was made in good\nfaith. 374 F.3d at 35.\n     6\n          As to legal theories, the Federal Rules themselves permit\npleading of inconsistent theories in a single action.

Carrasca, 313 F.3d at\n\n835;   see      also   Haring,       462   U.S.   at    318-19    (noting   that    \"a\n\ndefendant's decision to plead guilty may have any number of other\n\nmotivations,\" including shock, avoidance of financial and emotional\n\ncost, and hope for a lesser sentence).                 Accordingly, we reject the\n\nnotion    that    judicial     estoppel      automatically       applies    to    facts\n\nadmitted during guilty pleas.\n\nb.   Application of Doctrine to this Case\n\n               Having rejected any per se rule that judicial estoppel\n\nalways applies or never applies to facts admitted during a guilty\n\n\n                                           -25-\n\fplea, we turn to the question of application of the doctrine to the\n\nparticular facts of the case.            Our review is for whether the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion in applying estoppel here.\n\nAlternative Sys. Concepts, 374 F.3d at 30-31.\n\n            We note again that Thore has conceded that his current\n\nposition is directly inconsistent with facts admitted at his plea\n\ncolloquy.      Furthermore, based on the transcript of Thore's plea\n\ncolloquy, it was reasonable for the district court to conclude that\n\nthere was sufficient acceptance by the state court of the facts\n\npreviously admitted to by Thore.\n\n            Thore nevertheless attempts to fit his case into well-\n\nrecognized exceptions to judicial estoppel.           The Supreme Court has\n\nnoted   that    a   later   inconsistent     assertion      of    fact    will    not\n\nnecessarily     give    rise   to   judicial     estoppel    if    a     reasonable\n\njustification can be offered for a change in positions.                    See New\n\nHampshire, 532 U.S. at 753, 755 (noting that inadvertence or\n\nmistake may make application of judicial estoppel inappropriate,\n\nand   referencing      \"considerations      of   equity\"    in    deciding       that\n\njudicial estoppel was appropriate in that case).\n\n            The classic case of justification is \"when a party's\n\nprior position was based on inadvertence or mistake.\"                    Id. at 753\n\n(quoting John S.

The opinion held that the\n\ndistrict   court    should   require    sufficient     explanation     of   any\n\napparent   inconsistency.      Id.     at   806-07.

Neither\n\nargument is enough here to establish any abuse of discretion in the\n\ndistrict court's ruling.\n\n            Thore's argument that he truly does not recall the event\n\nbecause he was shot and so cannot be held to have personally\n\nremembered    the   details   he    agreed   with   at   the   colloquy   is\n\ndisingenuous.    No evidence at all supports this theory.         Even now\n\nhe does not argue that at the time of the plea colloquy, almost\n\nfour months after the shooting, he did not recall the events\n\nleading up to the shooting.        At most, he has said he did not recall\n\nwhat happened after he was shot and before he awakened in a\n\nhospital.    There is no evidence he was not competent at the time of\n\n\n     7\n          Similarly, where a witness gives a clear and unambiguous\nanswer, he may not defeat summary judgment with a contradictory\naffidavit unless he gives a satisfactory explanation of why the\ntestimony has changed.

He has offered no justification for his own switch in\n\nposition between the plea bargain and now on what happened before\n\nhe was shot.    Laro's version of the facts is irrelevant to Thore's\n\nown agreement with the recited facts.\n\n            There is also no explanation for why Thore did not\n\nattempt to talk to Laro before Thore pled guilty.             That Thore did\n\nnot think of it at the time is no more a justification than New\n\nHampshire's argument that it should be excused because it did\n\ninadequate research into the historical facts during the first\n\nproceeding.      Whatever   Laro   had   to   say,   this   was   information\n\navailable to Thore at the time of his plea.\n\n            As for Thore's attempt to assert reliance on the police\n\naccounts of Laro's interview, which Thore now says were fraud, a\n\ndistrict    court   could   consider     both   that    the   reliance    was\n\nunreasonable and the evidence of fraud very weak.\n\n            There are many explanations for Laro's reversal other\n\nthan that the police had engaged in a conspiracy and attributed\n\nfalse statements to Laro in their reports.             The contemporaneous\n\nstatements made to the police were signed by Laro at the time as\n\naccurate statements of the events.        That he now does not have the\n\nsame memory does not establish there was fraud or deception worked\n\non Thore or on the state criminal court by the police.9                   The\n\n\n     9\n          Thore also offered a statement from an accident\nreconstruction witness that concludes that \"the vehicular evidence\nnow available to us suggests the police were the aggressors in this\n\n                                   -29-\n\freports of the police officers, Thore's girlfriend, and the third-\n\nparty witness at the time all support exactly the facts recited to\n\nthe state court in the plea colloquy.10\n\n            Nor was it an abuse of discretion for the district court\n\nto   conclude   that   the   equities   supported   application    of   the\n\ndoctrine.    There is little to support the plaintiff's claim of\n\nfraud, and the defendants reasonably thought that the statements\n\nmade in the plea colloquy -- that Thore's actions had placed the\n\nofficers in fear of their lives -- protected them from exactly this\n\nlawsuit.\n\n            While   undoubtedly    cases   exist    in   which    criminal\n\ndefendants should not be held to the statements they made at the\n\ntime they pled guilty in a subsequent civil rights action, the\n\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in deciding this was\n\nnot one of those cases.\n\n            We affirm the entry of judgment for defendants.         Costs\n\nare awarded to defendants.\n\n\n\n\ncase.\" But that conclusion rests on Laro's testimony that Thore\ndid not hit any police cars.\n      10\n          As the defendant state officers point out, there are\nadditional equitable reasons to apply the estoppel doctrine.\nAlthough Thore's arguments on estoppel are largely based on the\ntruck driver's deposition, Thore filed the lawsuit a year before\nthe truck driver made any such statements.\n\n                                   -30-\n\f</pre>",
