On August 12, 2003, Rafael\n\nMorales-Rodríguez (\"Morales\" or \"defendant\") was charged in the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico in a\n\nfourteen-count indictment.    He was accused of conspiracy to commit\n\nmail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371 (Count One); mail\n\nfraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1341 (Counts Two through Ten);\n\nembezzlement of labor union funds, in violation of 29 U.S.C. § 501\n\n(c) (Counts Eleven and Twelve); structuring money transactions, in\n\nviolation of 31 U.S.C. §§ 5322(b) and 5324(3) and 18 U.S.C. § 2\n\n(Count Thirteen); and conspiracy to commit money laundering, in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h) (Count Fourteen).\n\n          On May 12, 2004, after a six-day jury trial, Morales was\n\nfound guilty of all charges except for Count Two.       On September 23,\n\nhe filed a motion requesting a new trial, but this was denied.       He\n\nwas sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 121 months as to Counts\n\nThree through Ten, and Counts Thirteen and Fourteen.             He was\n\nsentenced to a term of five years as to Counts One, Eleven, and\n\nTwelve.   All   sentences     were   to   be   served     concurrently.\n\nAdditionally, the district court imposed a supervised release\n\ncondition requiring Morales to submit to a drug test within fifteen\n\ndays of release and thereafter to random drug testing not to exceed\n\n104 samples per year.       On October 4, 2004, Morales filed this\n\nappeal, challenging both his convictions and his sentence.        After\n\ncareful consideration, we affirm.\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\f                               I.     Facts\n\n            From 1992 to 2003, Morales was Vice-President of Frente\n\nUnido de Policías Organizados (\"FUPO\"), and         José De Jesús-Serrano\n\n(\"De Jesús\") was FUPO's President.            FUPO was a not-for-profit\n\norganization open to police officers and security guards, whose\n\ngoal was to offer better working conditions and salaries for its\n\nmembers, as well as to provide legal representation in civil and\n\ncriminal cases against its members.\n\n            Through various outreach efforts including promotional\n\nmaterials sent by mail, FUPO made constant efforts to recruit new\n\nmembers.    New members filled out forms to authorize the payment of\n\nFUPO   membership   fees   through   automatic    deductions   from   their\n\nsalaries.     Members either personally delivered these forms to\n\nFUPO's offices or sent them by mail.          Once FUPO was in possession\n\nof a new member form, a letter signed by either Morales or De Jesús\n\nwould be sent by mail to the relevant agencies and municipalities,\n\nauthorizing the deduction of FUPO membership fees from the new\n\nmember's salary.    Once deducted, membership fees were sent to FUPO\n\nby mail.    FUPO received some fifty checks for membership fees each\n\nmonth by mail, and all checks were handled personally by Morales or\n\nDe Jesús.     Membership cards that were not picked up at FUPO's\n\noffices were sent by mail.       In the years 2002 and 2003, FUPO's\n\nmembership reached approximately 18,000.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f            Around the year 2000, members began to complain that\n\npromised services and benefits were not being delivered.                One of\n\nthe     ostensible     benefits     of   FUPO   membership    was    that    the\n\norganization assumed responsibility for members' attorneys' fees.\n\nIt seems that when members availed themselves of attorney services,\n\nit was customary for the attorneys to send the invoices directly to\n\nFUPO.      The    checks    were    then   prepared    by   Madeline   Cabrera\n\n(\"Cabrera\") but were not actually sent until so authorized by\n\nMorales    or    De   Jesús.       Typically,   FUPO   prepared     checks    for\n\nattorneys' fees totaling $70,000 to $80,000 per month.              Around the\n\nyear 2000, payments made for attorneys' fees declined, even though\n\nthe invoice amounts actually increased.           Although it appears that\n\nthe checks were being prepared, they were not always sent.                   Many\n\nmembers complained.\n\n            Also in the year 2000, members began to complain about\n\nFUPO's failure to provide other promised services.                Some members\n\nwho were suspended from work complained that they were not being\n\npaid the money FUPO had promised in the event of suspension.\n\nWidows complained that they were not receiving the promised $2000\n\ndeath benefit.        Payments of disability benefits were delayed.           At\n\nleast one FUPO area director informed De Jesús and Morales about\n\nthese problems, but the problems persisted.             When Cabrera became\n\nFUPO's Executive Secretary in 2003, she discovered that, while De\n\nJesús was President and Morales Vice-President, FUPO had fallen\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fseveral years behind in its payments of disability benefits and in\n\nits payments to the IRS, Hacienda (Treasury of Puerto Rico), and\n\nbank credit lines.\n\n             FUPO had a bank account at First Bank in Puerto Rico.\n\nMorales visited the bank each week.           There, he deposited checks\n\nmade   out   to   FUPO,   and   because    they    were   issued   by   various\n\ngovernment agencies (police force, fire department, etc.), they\n\ncleared immediately.       Copies of checks and transaction records\n\nintroduced at trial indicate that after depositing the checks,\n\nMorales then would purchase a manager's check, made out to FUPO,\n\nfor part of the deposit amount.      As for the remainder, he would ask\n\nthe bank to issue a check against FUPO's account, made out to\n\n\"cash\" for a specified amount (never exceeding $10,000). After the\n\nbank prepared the check, Morales would cash it and take the cash\n\nwith him.\n\n             FUPO also had a bank account at Banco Popular de Puerto\n\nRico (\"BPPR\"), opened by Morales and De Jesús.               Morales went to\n\nBPPR approximately once a month to deposit the First Bank manager's\n\nchecks that were made out to FUPO.                Then, Morales would issue\n\nchecks from FUPO's BPPR bank account to himself, to his company\n\n(J.R. Bodyguard), and to De Jesús.         No single check was ever issued\n\nin an amount exceeding $10,000, despite the fact that Morales often\n\nissued several checks to himself in the same day whose total amount\n\nexceeded $10,000.\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f           Typically, the total value of all checks issued to\n\nMorales was between $8,000 and $67,000 per month (totaling more\n\nthan one million dollars during the course of three years),1 while\n\nthose issued to De Jesús ranged from $7,000 to $95,000 per month\n\n(totaling more than $1.5 million during the same period).2      Morales\n\nand De Jesús used these funds for personal expenses, including\n\npayment of personal credit card bills.\n\n           Morales and De Jesús concealed the scheme, which was\n\nrepeated each month from January 2000 to December 2002, from other\n\nFUPO   employees   including   administrative   secretary   Joanna   Lind\n\n(\"Lind\"), who was in charge of FUPO's monthly expenses, and Héctor\n\nNavarro-Matos (\"Navarro\"), who was responsible for filing various\n\nFUPO financial reports with the Departments of State and Labor.\n\nAlso unaware of the fraud was Angel Troche (\"Troche\"), one of the\n\nfounders and leaders of FUPO.     Troche did not know FUPO was issuing\n\nchecks to \"cash.\"      In fact, neither he nor any of the other\n\ndirectors ever gained access to FUPO's account books.\n\n\n\n\n1\n   During this period, Morales's reported income (including his\nFUPO salary) steadily progressed from $36,000 in 1999 to $60,000 in\n2001.\n2\n  During this period, De Jesús reported his FUPO income as ranging\nfrom $48,000 in 1998 to $72,000 in 2001.\n\n                                   -6-\n\f                               II.   Analysis\n\nA.   Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n           Morales challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to\n\nsupport his conviction for mail fraud, conspiracy to commit mail\n\nfraud,   embezzlement,    structuring      monetary    transactions,      and\n\nconspiracy to commit money laundering.          We consider them seriatim.\n\nTo assess a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, \"we\n\n'review the record to determine whether the evidence and reasonable\n\ninferences therefrom, taken as a whole and in the light most\n\nfavorable to the prosecution, would allow a rational jury to\n\ndetermine beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendants were guilty\n\nas charged.'\"    United States v. Sullivan, 85 F.3d 743, 747 (1st\n\nCir. 1996) (quoting United States v. Mena-Robles, 4 F.3d 1026, 1031\n\n(1st Cir. 1993)).\n\n           1.   Counts One and Three through Ten:\n                Mail Fraud and Conspiracy to Commit Mail Fraud\n\n           Morales claims that the evidence presented at trial was\n\ninsufficient    to   support   his   convictions     for   mail   fraud   and\n\nconspiracy to commit mail fraud.           The mail fraud convictions\n\n(Counts Three through Ten) were based on eight separate membership\n\ndues checks, mailed between 2000 and 2002, the period during which\n\nMorales regularly transferred funds from FUPO's First Bank account\n\nto FUPO's BPPR account and then issued checks from FUPO's BPPR\n\naccount to himself, De Jesús, or one of their personal interests.\n\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f             To demonstrate a violation of the mail fraud statute, 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1341, the prosecution must prove \"(1) the devising or\n\nattempting to devise a scheme or artifice to defraud; (2) the\n\nknowing and willing participation in the scheme with the specific\n\nintent to defraud; and (3) the use of the mails in furtherance of\n\nthe scheme.\" United States v. McCann, 366 F.3d 46, 51 (1st Cir.\n\n2004) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), vacated on\n\nother grounds, McCann v. United States, 543 U.S. 1104 (2005).            The\n\ngovernment must also show, \"in order to prove causation, that the\n\ndefendant knew, or could have reasonably foreseen, that 'the use of\n\nthe mails [would] follow in the ordinary course of business.'\"\n\nUnited States v. Pimental, 380 F.3d 575, 584 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(quoting Pereira v. United States, 347 U.S. 1, 9 (1954)). Finally,\n\n\"[i]t is not necessary to prove that the defendant personally\n\nexecuted the mailings, but merely that the defendant caused the\n\nmailing by doing some act from which it is reasonably foreseeable\n\nthat the mails will be used.\" Id. (citation and internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).\n\n             As to the first requirement, we have held that \"[i]n\n\norder to find a 'scheme to defraud,' the jury simply had to\n\ndetermine that [Morales] was attempting to 'wrong[ ] one in his\n\nproperty rights by dishonest methods or schemes.'\" Id. at 585\n\n(quoting McNally v. United States, 483 U.S. 350, 358 (1987)).            The\n\nfacts   of   this   case   indicate   that   FUPO   membership   dues   were\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fmisappropriated for the personal gain of Morales and De Jesús,\n\nrather than put to use for the intended purpose of improving the\n\nworking conditions, professional growth, and legal resources of\n\nFUPO members.       There is little doubt that a rational jury could\n\nfind that Morales devised a scheme to defraud within the meaning of\n\nthe statute.\n\n            As to the second requirement of § 1341, Morales does not\n\ncontend     –-   and     the    record   does    not   suggest    --   that     his\n\nparticipation was in any way unwilling or unknowing.                   Under the\n\nthird requirement, a conviction for mail fraud must be supported by\n\nevidence that the mail was used in furtherance of the scheme.                   We\n\nhave held that \"[t]he mailing 'need not be an essential element of\n\nthe scheme'; it can be merely 'incident to an essential part of the\n\nscheme'\".      Id. at 586 (quoting Schmuck v. United States, 489 U.S.\n\n705, 710-11 (1989)). Here, promotional materials sent by mail were\n\nused to recruit new members, whose dues -- often sent by mail --\n\nMorales misappropriated.          New members authorized the deduction of\n\nFUPO fees from their salaries via forms sent by mail, and Morales\n\nand De Jesús in turn sent letters to the relevant agencies,\n\ninstructing that members' fees be deducted from their salaries, as\n\nauthorized. It seems quite clear that a rational jury could deduce\n\nfrom   these     facts   that    mailing   was   at    least   \"incident   to    an\n\nessential part\" of the fraudulent scheme.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\f           Finally, it is patently clear that a reasonable jury\n\ncould have found that the use of the mail was foreseeable.           In this\n\ncircuit, \"it is simply the 'use of the mails' in the course of the\n\nscheme rather than the particular mailing at issue that must be\n\nreasonably foreseeable for the causation element of a mail fraud\n\noffense to be satisfied.\"       Pimental, 380 F.3d at 589.          Once new\n\nmembers   had   authorized   automatic    deductions     of    their    FUPO\n\nmembership dues from their paychecks, FUPO would send a letter --\n\nsigned by Morales or De Jesús -- to the relevant agencies and\n\nmunicipalities.      FUPO received some fifty checks per month in\n\nmembership dues through the mail.      Morales and De Jesús personally\n\nsorted through the mail received at FUPO, kept the checks, and\n\nhanded over the remainder of the mail to Cabrera.              We have no\n\ntrouble concluding that a jury could have found the use of the\n\nmails to be reasonably foreseeable in the course of this scheme.\n\n           Morales raises two arguments in support of his contention\n\nthat the evidence was insufficient to support his mail fraud\n\nconviction.     First, he claims that because FUPO is a charitable\n\norganization engaged in a lawful enterprise, the mail fraud statute\n\nis   inapplicable.    Second,   he   argues   that   because   no    witness\n\ntestified at trial that he used the mail to defraud FUPO, no\n\nrational jury could have convicted him of mail fraud.\n\n           In support of his contention that the mail fraud statute\n\ndoes not apply where funds were received through the mail by a\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\flegitimate non-profit organization and then misapplied by its\n\nofficers, Morales cites only one fifty-year-old case from the\n\nNorthern District of California.    United States v. Beall, 126 F.\n\nSupp. 363 (N.D. Cal. 1954).   This is not the law of our circuit,\n\nand Morales does not persuade us that it should be otherwise.\n\n          Morales next contends that because no witness testified\n\nat trial as to his use of the mail to further his fraudulent\n\nscheme, there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction\n\nas to the mail fraud charges.      However, direct evidence is not\n\nnecessary to prove mail fraud.    See Pimental, 380 F.3d at 585.   We\n\nfind that the evidence was sufficient to support Morales's mail\n\nfraud conviction as to Counts Three through Ten.\n\n          To support a guilty verdict as to the conspiracy count\n\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 371, the evidence must show beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt \"the existence of a conspiracy, the defendant's knowledge of\n\nit, and his voluntary participation in it.\"        United States v.\n\nYefsky, 994 F.2d 885, 890 (1st Cir. 1993).       To prove voluntary\n\nparticipation, \"the government must prove that the defendant had an\n\nintent to agree and an intent to effectuate the object of the\n\nconspiracy.\" United States v. Royal, 100 F.3d 1019, 1029 (1st Cir.\n\n1996).   Further, \"when the commission of mail fraud is a goal of\n\nthe conspiracy, the government must show either an intent to use\n\nthe mails or the reasonable foreseeability of such use.\"    Yefsky,\n\n994 F.2d at 890 (emphasis added).\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\f           Evidence introduced at trial revealed that Morales and De\n\nJesús worked together to execute the fraud and that they kept it\n\nhidden   from   all   other   FUPO   members   and   employees.   Morales\n\npersonally deposited membership checks in FUPO's First Bank account\n\neach week and issued checks to himself and De Jesús from FUPO's\n\nBPPR account every month.      A reasonable jury could have found that\n\nthere was a conspiracy, of which Morales was aware, and in which\n\nMorales participated.\n\n           Morales claims that a conviction for conspiracy to commit\n\nmail fraud must be supported by a showing of an intent to use the\n\nmail to effect the scheme.      This position is simply incorrect, as\n\nit directly contravenes the law of this circuit.           The government\n\nneed only show the reasonable foreseeability of the use of the mail\n\nin the execution of the conspiracy.         Id.; see also United States v.\n\nDray, 901 F.2d 1132, 1137 (1st Cir. 1990); United States v.\n\nDelgado-Figueroa, 832 F.2d 691, 696 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\n           2.   Counts Eleven and Twelve:\n                Embezzlement of Labor Union Funds\n\n           Morales claims there was no federal jurisdiction as to\n\nCounts Eleven and Twelve because they were based on the premise\n\nthat FUPO is a labor organization engaged in an industry affecting\n\ninterstate commerce, as defined by § 402(j) of the Labor Management\n\nReporting and Disclosure Act (\"LMRDA\").          Section § 501(c) of the\n\nLMRDA is violated by \"[a]ny person who embezzles, steals, or\n\nunlawfully and willfully abstracts or converts to his own use, or\n\n                                     -12-\n\fthe use of another, any of the moneys, funds, securities, property,\n\nor other assets of a labor organization of which he is an officer,\n\nor by which he is employed, directly or indirectly.\"     29 U.S.C.\n\n§ 501(c) (emphasis added).      The term \"labor organization\" is\n\ndefined by the LMRDA as an organization \"engaged in an industry\n\naffecting commerce and includes any organization . . . in which\n\nemployees participate and which exists for the purpose, in whole or\n\npart, of dealing with employers . . .\"         29 U.S.C. § 402(i)\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n          Morales appeals his conviction as to Counts Eleven and\n\nTwelve on the ground that FUPO is not a labor organization under\n\nthe LMRDA because it is not \"engaged in an industry affecting\n\ncommerce.\"3   For its part, the government does not respond to this\n\nargument at all.4\n\n\n\n\n3\n    Morales also claims that FUPO is not a labor organization\nbecause Puerto Rico law prohibits police officers from organizing\nor engaging in collective bargaining.       However, Morales was\nconvicted under LMRDA, a federal statute.     Morales develops no\nargument as to why Puerto Rico law -- rather than federal law --\nshould control this case, and we consider this line of inquiry no\nfurther.\n4\n   Instead, the government inexplicably focuses on an altogether\nseparate component of the definition of a labor organization under\n§ 402(i), that it exists \"for the purpose, in whole or part, of\ndealing with employers.\" 29 U.S.C. § 402(i)(emphasis added).\nBecause Morales does not challenge FUPO's status as a labor union\nwith respect to this requirement, we consider the argument waived.\nSee, e.g., Am. Cyanamid Co. v. Capuano, 381 F.3d 6, 18 (1st Cir.\n2004).\n\n                                -13-\n\f          The LMRDA deems a labor organization to be \"engaged in an\n\nindustry affecting commerce\" if it\n\n          (1) is the certified representative of\n          employees under the provisions of the National\n          Labor Relations Act, as amended [29 U.S.C.A. §\n          151 et seq.], or the Railway Labor Act, as\n          amended [45 U.S.C.A. § 151 et seq.]; or\n\n          (2) although not certified, is a national or\n          international labor organization or a local\n          labor organization recognized or acting as the\n          representative of employees of an employer or\n          employers engaged in an industry affecting\n          commerce; or\n\n          (3) has chartered a local labor organization\n          or subsidiary body which is representing or\n          actively seeking to represent employees of\n          employers within the meaning of paragraph (1)\n          or (2); or\n\n          (4) has been chartered by a labor organization\n          representing or actively seeking to represent\n          employees within the meaning of paragraph (1)\n          or (2) as the local or subordinate body\n          through which such employees may enjoy\n          membership or become affiliated with such\n          labor organization; or\n\n          (5) is a conference, general committee, joint\n          or system board, or joint council, subordinate\n          to   a   national   or   international   labor\n          organization,    which   includes    a   labor\n          organization engaged in an industry affecting\n          commerce within the meaning of any of the\n          preceding paragraphs of this subsection, other\n          than a State or local central body.\n\n29 U.S.C. § 402(j).   Morales argues that FUPO does not meet any of\n\nthe above requirements because the vast majority of FUPO's members\n\nare police officers employed by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and\n\nthus FUPO is not the representative of employees of an employer or\n\n\n                                -14-\n\femployers engaged in an industry affecting commerce.          The LMRDA\n\ndefines the phrase \"industry affecting commerce\" as\n\n          any activity, business, or industry in\n          commerce or in which a labor dispute would\n          hinder or obstruct commerce or the free flow\n          of commerce and includes any activity or\n          industry \"affecting commerce\" within the\n          meaning of the Labor Management Relations Act,\n          1947, as amended [29 U.S.C. §§ 141 et seq.],\n          or the Railway Labor Act, as amended [45\n          U.S.C. §§ 151 et seq.].\n\n29 U.S.C. § 402(c). At trial, the government presented evidence to\n\nthe jury of FUPO's activities \"affecting commerce,\" consisting of\n\nthe following: the majority of FUPO's members are members of the\n\npolice force in Puerto Rico, which uses Smith and Wesson firearms,\n\nCrown   Victoria   cars,   and   helicopters,   none   of    which   are\n\nmanufactured in Puerto Rico; and FUPO has six or seven dues-paying\n\nmembers who work for J.R. Bodyguard, a private security company\n\nthat uses armored trucks purchased in Canada, cars manufactured by\n\nSuzuki, arms manufactured by Smith and Wesson, and which services\n\nnational companies like Sam's Club and Office Max.      Morales cites\n\nnary a case to support his contention that these activities do not\n\nconstitute engagement in an industry affecting commerce and are\n\nthus not sufficient to qualify FUPO as a labor organization under\n\nthe statute.   Our standard of review constrains us to consider the\n\nevidence in the light most favorable to the verdict.        A reasonable\n\njury could conclude that FUPO was sufficiently engaged in commerce\n\n\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fto satisfy the statute, and we affirm Morales's conviction as to\n\nCounts Eleven and Twelve.\n\n          3.    Count Thirteen:   Structuring Monetary Transactions\n\n          Morales argues that there was insufficient evidence to\n\nsustain his conviction for structuring monetary transactions.    The\n\nBank Secrecy Act requires domestic banks to report any transactions\n\ninvolving more than $10,000 in cash (such reports are known as cash\n\ntransaction reports, or \"CTR\").     See 31 U.S.C. § 5313.   Further,\n\n\"[n]o person shall, for the purpose of evading the reporting\n\nrequirements of section 5313(a) . . . structure or assist in\n\nstructuring, or attempt to structure or assist in structuring, any\n\ntransaction with one or more domestic financial institutions.\" Id.\n\n§ 5324(a)(3).    The Supreme Court has defined structuring as \"to\n\nbreak up a single transaction above the reporting threshold into\n\ntwo or more separate transactions for the purpose of evading a\n\nfinancial institution's reporting requirement.\"    Ratzlaf v. United\n\nStates, 510 U.S. 135, 136 (1994).\n\n          Morales contends 1) that the evidence was insufficient\n\nbecause none of the government witnesses testified as to any\n\nwillful violation of the structuring statute, and 2) that because\n\nthe transactions in question involved checks, not cash, they do not\n\nfall within the ambit of 31 U.S.C. § 5324.\n\n          Evidence introduced at trial reveals that BPPR never\n\nfiled a CTR for any of Morales's transactions because he never\n\n\n                                  -16-\n\fissued a check in excess of $10,000, despite the fact that he often\n\nissued several checks to himself on the same day, whose total value\n\nexceeded that amount.            Similarly, of the numerous handwritten\n\nchecks made out to \"cash\" signed by Morales and drawn upon FUPO's\n\nFirst Bank account, none exceeded $10,000, even when the total\n\nvalue   of    checks    cashed    in     a   single   day   exceeded      $10,000.\n\nAdditionally, the checks that Morales's brothers cashed from FUPO's\n\nFirst Bank account never exceeded $10,000.\n\n             Morales maintains that there was insufficient evidence to\n\nsupport his conviction because none of the government witnesses\n\ntestified      that    Morales    ever       willfully   caused    a   financial\n\ninstitution to fail to file a CTR.            Although this argument is quite\n\npoorly developed, we assume that its intention is to suggest that\n\nhis violation of § 5324 was not willful.              In Ratzlaf, the Supreme\n\nCourt held that a structuring conviction requires a showing \"that\n\nthe defendant acted with knowledge that his conduct was unlawful.\"\n\n510 U.S. at 137.       However, Congress later amended the statute so\n\nthat willfulness is no longer required for a violation of 31 U.S.C.\n\n§ 5324.      See Aversa v. United States, 99 F.3d 1200, 1205 n.4 (1st\n\nCir. 1996).\n\n             Drawing    all   reasonable       inferences   in    favor    of   the\n\nverdict, we have no doubt that the evidence presented in this case\n\nwould permit a rational jury to find that Morales violated the\n\nanti-structuring statute.         During the period between January 2000\n\n\n                                       -17-\n\fand December 2002, Morales prepared dozens of BPPR checks, drawn\n\nagainst FUPO's account and made out to cash, for a total value of\n\nwell over $1,000,000.      Not a single check exceeded $10,000 in\n\nvalue.   The consistent avoidance of the $10,000 threshold over a\n\nperiod of almost three years would, in our view, permit a jury to\n\nconclude that Morales divided all transactions above the reporting\n\nthreshold \"for the purpose of evading the reporting requirements,\"\n\nin violation of § 5324.\n\n            Morales next argues that the transactions that served as\n\nthe basis for his conviction do not come within the ambit of\n\nsections 5314 and 5324 of Title 31 because they involved checks and\n\nnot cash.    This argument fails because many of the transactions in\n\nquestion involved cashing checks, such that Morales -- or someone\n\nsent on his behalf -- would routinely exit the bank with thousands\n\nof dollars in cash.      We have observed that \"[t]he most common\n\nmethod of 'structuring' is to divide sums of cash into amounts that\n\nare either under the $10,000 reporting threshold or into amounts\n\nthat are larger but still less likely to attract attention.\"\n\nUnited States v. Hurley, 63 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir. 1995).         The\n\nevidence in this case suggests that Morales acted exactly as Hurley\n\ndescribes.    Morales develops no argument as to why this activity\n\ndoes not fall within the purview of the Bank Secrecy Act, which\n\n\"requires domestic banks to report any transactions involving more\n\nthan $10,000 in cash.\"     Id. (emphasis added).   We find that his\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\factivity   was   exactly   the   sort   that   31   U.S.C.   §   5324(a)(3)\n\nproscribes.\n\n           4. Count Fourteen: Conspiracy to Commit Money Laundering\n\n           Morales was convicted of conspiracy to commit money\n\nlaundering under 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h).      To find Morales guilty, the\n\njury had to find that the government proved beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt that Morales conspired with De Jesús to commit the offense of\n\nmoney laundering, which is comprised of four elements:\n\n           (1) that [Morales] knowingly conducted a\n           financial transaction, (2) that he knew the\n           transaction involved funds that were the\n           proceeds of some form of unlawful activity,\n           (3) that the funds involved were in fact the\n           proceeds of a specified unlawful activity, and\n           (4) that [Morales] engaged in the financial\n           transaction knowing that it was designed in\n           whole or in part to conceal or disguise the\n           nature,   location,   source,  ownership,   or\n           control of the proceeds of such unlawful\n           activity.\n\nUnited States v. Cruzado-Laureano, 404 F.3d 470, 483 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n           Morales claims that no rational jury could have convicted\n\nhim of money laundering because 1) he did not conduct any financial\n\ntransactions that affected interstate commerce; 2) he did not\n\nengage in any transaction knowing that it was designed in whole or\n\nin part to conceal or disguise the nature, location, source,\n\nownership, or control of the proceeds of such unlawful activity;\n\nand 3) the government did not present any direct evidence to\n\n\n\n                                  -19-\n\festablish that he conducted financial transactions to conceal the\n\nnature of his mail fraud activities.\n\n          Morales    first   maintains     that    he   was   not   properly\n\nconvicted under the money laundering statute because he did not\n\nconduct a \"financial transaction\" within the meaning of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1956(c)(4).    That section defines a financial transaction as\n\n          (A) a transaction which in any way or degree\n          affects interstate or foreign commerce (i)\n          involving the movement of funds by wire or\n          other means or (ii) involving one or more\n          monetary instruments, or (iii) involving the\n          transfer of title to any real property,\n          vehicle, vessel, or aircraft, or (B) a\n          transaction involving the use of a financial\n          institution which is engaged in, or the\n          activities of which affect, interstate or\n          foreign commerce in any way or degree;\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1956(c)(4) (emphases added).           Morales only addresses\n\npart (A), claiming that he was involved in no transaction that\n\naffected interstate or foreign commerce.          He entirely ignores the\n\nremainder of this subsection.\n\n          Even if we accept, arguendo, Morales's contention that he\n\nwas involved in no financial transaction affecting interstate\n\ncommerce within the meaning of subsection (A), we find that a jury\n\ncould   have    determined   that    he    was    involved    in    financial\n\ntransactions as defined in subsection (B).          The government's case\n\nincluded evidence that Morales and De Jesús retained exclusive\n\ncontrol of the membership dues checks received by mail, that they\n\ndeposited the majority of the checks so received in FUPO's First\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\fBank account each month, that they then transferred funds -- using\n\nmanager's checks -- from FUPO's First Bank account to its BPPR\n\naccount, and that Morales and De Jesús regularly issued checks to\n\nthemselves from the BPPR account.               Each of these actions –-\n\ndepositing checks at a bank, transferring funds from one bank to\n\nanother, and issuing checks –- involved one or more financial\n\ninstitutions engaged in interstate commerce. Given these facts, we\n\nthink   a   rational   jury   could    easily    have    found   that   Morales\n\nconducted a financial transaction within the plain meaning of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1956(c)(4)(B).\n\n            Morales    next   challenges        the     sufficiency     of   the\n\ngovernment's evidence as to the fourth element of the Cruzado-\n\nLaureano test, claiming that \"absolutely no evidence\" –- either\n\ndirect or circumstantial -- was presented at trial to establish\n\nthat he engaged in any financial transaction knowing that it was\n\ndesigned in whole or in part to conceal or disguise the nature,\n\nlocation, source, ownership, or control of the proceeds of such\n\nunlawful activity.     Morales points to United States v. Dimeck, 24\n\nF.3d 1239 (10th Cir. 1994), to support his argument that, even if\n\nthe checks that he issued to himself and De Jesús were the proceeds\n\nof illegal activity, his activities did not constitute money\n\nlaundering.       In   Dimeck,    the        court    found   that    the    mere\n\ntransportation of concealed drug money did not constitute money\n\nlaundering because the money laundering statute \"was designed to\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\fpunish those . . . who thereafter take the additional step of\n\nattempting to legitimize their proceeds so that observers think\n\ntheir money is derived from legal enterprises.\"                  Id. at 1247.      We\n\nfind the facts of Dimeck to be easily distinguishable from the\n\npresent case. The facts, when considered in a light most favorable\n\nto the verdict, suggest that Morales did far more than simply\n\ntransport ill-gotten wealth.            A rational jury could have found the\n\nevidence sufficient to indicate that Morales's monthly secretive\n\ntransfer of FUPO membership funds between three separate bank\n\naccounts -- FUPO's First Bank account, FUPO's BPPR account, and\n\nMorales's personal BPPR account -- was an attempt to conceal the\n\nnature, location, source, ownership, and control of proceeds.\n\nFurther,   a   jury    could     have   found    that     Morales's     practice   of\n\nlimiting the value of each check issued to himself or De Jesús to\n\n$10,000 so as to avoid bank reporting, indicates an effort to\n\nconceal the true nature, source, and ownership of the proceeds.\n\nSpecifically, we think it quite clear that a jury could have found\n\nthat these complicated machinations were intended to create the\n\nappearance of legitimate income.\n\n           Finally, Morales suggests that the evidence at trial was\n\ninsufficient     to    support    his    conviction     because    no    government\n\nwitness directly testified as to his participation in any money\n\nlaundering activity.        However, we have held that circumstantial\n\nevidence   can    be    sufficient       to     support     a   money    laundering\n\n\n                                        -22-\n\fconviction.        Cruzado-Laureano, 404 F.3d at 483 (\"A conviction\n\nrequires evidence of intent to disguise or conceal the transaction,\n\nwhether from direct evidence, like the defendant's own statements,\n\nor from circumstantial evidence, like the use of a third party to\n\ndisguise the true owner, or unusual secrecy.\").             In this instance,\n\nthe lack of direct evidence is a direct result of the secret\n\nconspiracy between Morales and De Jesús.              The fact that only\n\nMorales and De Jesús knew of the scheme only emphasizes its\n\nsecretive nature and the deceit involved with its execution.\n\nEveryone else at FUPO -- from top-level officers to administrative\n\nsecretaries -- was kept in the dark.           For these reasons, we find\n\nthat a rational jury could have found the evidence at trial\n\nsufficient    to    convict   Morales    of   conspiracy    to   commit   money\n\nlaundering.\n\nB.   Brady Violation\n\n           Morales argues that the government breached its duty\n\nunder Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), to provide him with\n\nexculpatory evidence in its possession.              On August 18, 2003,\n\nMorales filed a motion requesting any exculpatory information from\n\nthe government, consistent with Brady.          On August 25, the district\n\ncourt   granted     the   motion.   By     letter   dated    August   26,   the\n\ngovernment noted that \"[a]s of this date, no exculpatory evidence\n\nhas been uncovered,\" but promised to \"provide any exculpatory\n\nevidences which may be uncovered in the future.\"\n\n\n                                    -23-\n\f            Morales maintains that, at the time of the prosecution's\n\nAugust 26 letter, the government was already in possession of\n\nexculpatory evidence that it failed to disclose, in violation of\n\nBrady.     The evidence in question was the contents of two FBI\n\nreports detailing interviews with De Jesús.            In those reports, De\n\nJesús stated -- among other things -- that he had won approximately\n\n$2.5 million over the course of three years in a horse race, which\n\nhad enabled him to regularly loan money to FUPO.            Specifically, he\n\nsaid that during an approximately three-year period, he had lent\n\nmore than $300,000 to FUPO, and that Morales had lent FUPO $75,000.\n\nDe Jesús explained that the money he and Morales took from FUPO's\n\nbank accounts constituted repayment of the loans.             As evidence, De\n\nJesús presented copies of two cancelled checks, dated 1998 and\n\n1999, drawn on his personal account and made out to FUPO for\n\n$50,000    and    $100,000   respectively.        Morales   claims    that   the\n\ngovernment never informed him of the contents of these reports or\n\nof the two cancelled checks.       He argues that this information was\n\nmaterial    and    exculpatory    because    it    provided    a     legitimate\n\nexplanation for his appropriation of FUPO's funds.\n\n            An alleged Brady violation must satisfy three elements:\n\n\"The evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused, either\n\nbecause it is exculpatory, or because it is impeaching; that\n\nevidence must have been suppressed by the State, either willfully\n\nor inadvertently; and prejudice must have ensued.\"              Strickler v.\n\n\n                                    -24-\n\fGreene, 527 U.S. 263, 281-82 (1999).             We review the district\n\ncourt's denial of a motion for a new trial on the basis of alleged\n\nBrady violations for manifest abuse of discretion.            United States\n\nv. Hansen, 434 F.3d 92, 102 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n            Morales   claims   that    all   three   prongs   are   satisfied\n\nbecause the information was exculpatory, the prosecution suppressed\n\nit, and there was a reasonable probability that the verdict would\n\nhave been different if the evidence had been disclosed to the jury.\n\nWe consider each element in turn.\n\n            Morales claims that the evidence was exculpatory because\n\nit provided a legitimate explanation for his activities.                   We\n\ndisagree.    Even assuming the credibility of De Jesús's statements\n\nregarding his loan to FUPO of $300,000 and Morales's loan of\n\n$75,000, there still remains $2.4 million of FUPO funds unaccounted\n\nfor.   Further, the allegedly exculpatory reports include many\n\nstatements by De Jesús, ignored in Morales's brief, that are\n\nactually    incriminating   to   Morales.      For   example,   the    report\n\nreflects 1) that De Jesús admits that \"he kept writing checks to\n\nhimself and Morales after he felt that he had repaid himself for\n\nthe loans\"; 2) that De Jesús and Morales continued writing checks\n\nto themselves because \"they started the organization and they\n\nlooked on it as their own money\"; 3) that they always wrote the\n\nchecks for $10,000 or less \"so that they could avoid notification\n\nto Hacienda and the federal reporting requirements\"; 4) that De\n\n\n                                      -25-\n\fJesús never reported the money he took from FUPO to Hacienda on his\n\ntax returns and does not believe Morales did either; 5) that De\n\nJesús believes that he has taken between $1 million and $1.5\n\nmillion from FUPO in addition to what he claims to have lent the\n\norganization; and 6) that De Jesús believes Morales used the funds\n\nto open and support several security businesses.      Although we are\n\nnot convinced that this evidence was exculpatory, we proceed to the\n\nsecond prong of Brady.\n\n          Under Brady, the government is obligated to disclose\n\nexculpatory evidence.    373 U.S. at 87.    Assuming that the evidence\n\nin question is exculpatory, we find no Brady violation because the\n\ngovernment did not suppress it. The government allowed the defense\n\nto conduct open-file discovery of all documents in its possession,\n\nwhich included the FBI reports of De Jesús's statements, which the\n\ngovernment requested to be returned only after the defense had an\n\nopportunity to read them.   At sentencing, the district judge found\n\nunpersuasive Morales's claim that the government requested the\n\nreturn of the documents before the defense had an opportunity to\n\nread all of them.   We find no abuse of discretion.\n\n          Finally, a valid Brady claim requires a showing that the\n\nevidence in question was material.         The Supreme Court has made\n\nquite clear that, for Brady purposes, \"[t]he evidence is material\n\nonly if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence\n\nbeen disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would\n\n\n                                -26-\n\fhave been different.\"        United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 682\n\n(1985). We find that the proffered evidence was not material.                 The\n\nevidence against Morales was very strong, and De Jesús's statements\n\ncontained within the allegedly exculpatory FBI reports only served\n\nto corroborate the prosecution's theory of the case. Further, even\n\nif credible, De Jesús's explanation of the scheme leaves almost\n\n$2.5 million unaccounted for.          We find no Brady violation.\n\nC.    Sentencing Guidelines\n\n            Morales     contends     that   the   district   court   improperly\n\ndelegated its sentencing authority when it imposed a supervised\n\nrelease condition requiring Morales to submit to a drug test within\n\nfifteen days of release, and thereafter to random drug testing not\n\nto exceed 104 samples per year. Morales claims that this condition\n\nwarrants remand for re-sentencing in light of United States v.\n\nBooker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005).\n\n            Morales did not preserve his Booker claim below, and thus\n\nour    review    is   for    plain     error.       See   United     States    v.\n\nAntonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 75 (1st Cir. 2005).                     Similarly,\n\nMorales did not object to the supervised release conditions at\n\nsentencing, and our review of that issue is for plain error.                  See\n\nUnited States v. Padilla, 415 F.3d 211, 218 (1st Cir. 2005) (en\n\nbanc).    In order for us to correct an error to which there was no\n\nobjection in the district court, \"[t]here must be an 'error' that\n\nis     'plain'    and       that     'affect[s]      substantial      rights.'\"\n\n\n                                       -27-\n\fAntonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 77 (quoting United States v. Olano, 507\n\nU.S. 725, 732 (1993)).\n\n           Morales claims that the supervised release terms were an\n\nimpermissible   delegation       of    judicial    authority.     Morales\n\nspecifically claims that the supervised release terms allowed the\n\nprobation officer to decide the number of drug tests to which he\n\nwould need to submit.       It is the law of this circuit that, in\n\nstipulating   the   terms   of   a    supervised   release   provision,   a\n\nsentencing judge \"may not . . . vest the probation officer with the\n\ndiscretion to order an unlimited number of drug tests.\"            United\n\nStates v. Meléndez-Santana, 353 F.3d 93, 103 (1st Cir. 2003), rev'd\n\non other grounds, Padilla, 415 F.3d at 215.           However, Morales's\n\nclaim fails because no such delegation actually occurred in this\n\ncase.   At sentencing, the judge ordered Morales to\n\n           refrain from the unlawful use of controlled\n           substances and submit to drug testing within\n           fifteen days of release. Thereafter submit to\n           random drug tests not to exceed 104 samples\n           per year, in accordance with the drug after\n           care program policy of the U.S. probation\n           office, approved by this Court.\n\nThe probation officer did not have unlimited discretion to order an\n\nunlimited number of tests.       Rather, the sentencing judge clearly\n\nestablished an upper limit to the number of drug tests that can\n\nproperly be ordered upon Morales's release.            In a recent case\n\nraising almost the identical issue, we held that where, as here,\n\nthe \"district court itself required that defendant submit to random\n\n\n                                      -28-\n\fdrug testing 'not to exceed 104 samples per year,'\" there was no\n\ndelegation error. United States v. Laureano-Vélez, 424 F.3d 38, 41\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).     Because we find no error, we need not reach the\n\nother prongs of plain error review.\n\n           Morales   next   maintains     that   the   supervised   release\n\ncondition warrants remand in light of Booker.5             The government\n\nconcedes that the district court treated the sentencing guidelines\n\nas mandatory.     In Antonakopoulos, we held that \"[t]he first two\n\nOlano requirements -- that an error exists and that it is plain at\n\nthe time of appeal -- are satisfied whenever the district court\n\ntreated the Guidelines as mandatory at the time of sentencing.\"\n\n399 F.3d at 75.      Under the third prong we ask \"whether [Morales\n\nhas] pointed to circumstances that create a reasonable probability\n\nthat the district court would have imposed a more lenient sentence\n\nhad the guidelines been advisory.\" United States v. Sánchez-\n\nBerríos, 424 F.3d 65, 80 (1st Cir. 2005).        Morales has made no such\n\nshowing.\n\n                            III.   Conclusion\n\n           For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Morales's conviction\n\nand sentence.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n5\n   Morales does not contend that remand is warranted so that the\ndistrict court can reconsider the severity of the sentence in light\nof Booker. Thus, we do not consider this possibility.\n\n                                   -29-\n\f",

He was accused of conspiracy to commit mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371 (Count One); mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1341 (Counts Two through Ten); embezzlement of labor union funds, in violation of 29 U.S.C. &#167; 501(c) (Counts Eleven and Twelve); structuring money transactions, in violation of 31 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 5322(b) and 5324(3) and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2 (Count Thirteen); and conspiracy to commit money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(h) (Count Fourteen).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 12, 2004, after a six-day jury trial, Morales was found guilty of all charges except for Count Two. On September 23, he filed a motion requesting a new trial, but this was denied. He was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 121 months as to Counts Three through Ten, and Counts Thirteen and Fourteen. He was sentenced to a term of five years as to Counts One, Eleven, and Twelve. All sentences were to be served concurrently. Additionally, the district court imposed a supervised release condition requiring Morales to submit to a drug test within fifteen days of release and thereafter to random drug testing not to exceed 104 samples per year. On October 4, 2004, Morales filed this appeal, challenging both his convictions and his sentence. After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From 1992 to 2003, Morales was Vice-President of Frente Unido de Polic&#237;as Organizados (\"FUPO\"), and Jos&#233; De Jes&#250;s-Serrano (\"De Jes&#250;s\") was FUPO's President. FUPO was a not-for-profit organization open to police officers and security guards, whose goal was to offer better working conditions and salaries for its members, as well as to provide legal representation in civil and criminal cases against its members.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Through various outreach efforts including promotional materials sent by mail, FUPO made constant efforts to recruit new members. New members filled out forms to authorize the payment of FUPO membership fees through automatic deductions from their salaries. Members either personally delivered these forms to FUPO's offices or sent them by mail. Once FUPO was in possession of a new member form, a letter signed by either Morales or De Jes&#250;s would be sent by mail to the relevant agencies and municipalities, authorizing the deduction of FUPO membership fees from the new member's salary. Once deducted, membership fees were sent to FUPO by mail. FUPO received some fifty checks for membership fees each month by mail, and all checks were handled personally by Morales or De Jes&#250;s. Membership cards that were not picked up at FUPO's offices were sent by mail. In the years 2002 and 2003, FUPO's membership reached approximately 18,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Around the year 2000, members began to complain that promised services and benefits were not being delivered. One of the ostensible benefits of FUPO membership was that the organization assumed responsibility for members' attorneys' fees. It seems that when members availed themselves of attorney services, it was customary for the attorneys to send the invoices directly to FUPO. The checks were then prepared by Madeline Cabrera (\"Cabrera\") but were not actually sent until so authorized by Morales or De Jes&#250;s. Typically, FUPO prepared checks for attorneys' fees totaling $70,000 to $80,000 per month. Around the year 2000, payments made for attorneys' fees declined, even though the invoice amounts actually increased. Although it appears that the checks were being prepared, they were not always sent. Many members complained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also in the year 2000, members began to complain about FUPO's failure to provide other promised services. Some members who were suspended from work complained that they were not being paid the money FUPO had promised in the event of suspension. Widows complained that they were not receiving the promised $2000 death benefit. Payments of disability benefits were delayed. At least one FUPO area director informed De Jes&#250;s and Morales about these problems, but the problems persisted. When Cabrera became FUPO's Executive Secretary in 2003, she discovered that, while De Jes&#250;s was President and Morales Vice-President, FUPO had fallen several years behind in its payments of disability benefits and in its payments to the IRS, Hacienda (Treasury of Puerto Rico), and bank credit lines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FUPO had a bank account at First Bank in Puerto Rico. Morales visited the bank each week. There, he deposited checks made out to FUPO, and because they were issued by various government agencies (police force, fire department, etc.), they cleared immediately. Copies of checks and transaction records introduced at trial indicate that after depositing the checks, Morales then would purchase a manager's check, made out to FUPO, for part of the deposit amount. As for the remainder, he would ask the bank to issue a check against FUPO's account, made out to \"cash\" for a specified amount (never exceeding $10,000). After the bank prepared the check, Morales would cash it and take the cash with him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FUPO also had a bank account at Banco Popular de Puerto Rico (\"BPPR\"), opened by Morales and De Jes&#250;s. Morales went to BPPR approximately once a month to deposit the First Bank manager's checks that were made out to FUPO. Then, Morales would issue checks from FUPO's BPPR bank account to himself, to his company (J.R. Bodyguard), and to De Jes&#250;s. No single check was ever issued in an amount exceeding $10,000, despite the fact that Morales often issued several checks to himself in the same day whose total amount exceeded $10,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Typically, the total value of all checks issued to Morales was between $8,000 and $67,000 per month (totaling more than one million dollars during the course of three years),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> while those issued to De Jes&#250;s ranged from $7,000 to $95,000 per month (totaling more than $1.5 million during the same period).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Morales and De Jes&#250;s used these funds for personal expenses, including payment of personal credit card bills.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales and De Jes&#250;s concealed the scheme, which was repeated each month from January 2000 to December 2002, from other FUPO employees including administrative secretary Joanna Lind (\"Lind\"), who was in charge of FUPO's monthly expenses, and H&#233;ctor Navarro-Matos (\"Navarro\"), who was responsible for filing various FUPO financial reports with the Departments of State and Labor. Also unaware of the fraud was Angel Troche (\"Troche\"), one of the founders and leaders of FUPO. Troche did not know FUPO was issuing checks to \"cash.\" In fact, neither he nor any of the other directors ever gained access to FUPO's account books.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Analysis</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction for mail fraud, conspiracy to commit mail fraud, embezzlement, structuring monetary transactions, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. We consider them seriatim. To assess a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, \"we `review the record to determine whether the evidence and reasonable inferences therefrom, taken as a whole and in the light most favorable to the prosecution, would allow a rational jury to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendants were guilty as charged.'\" <i>United States v. Sullivan,</i> 85 F.3d 743, 747 (1st Cir.1996) (quoting <i>United States v. Mena-Robles,</i> 4 F.3d 1026, 1031 (1st Cir.1993)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Counts One and Three through Ten: Mail Fraud and Conspiracy to Commit Mail Fraud</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales claims that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support his convictions for mail fraud and conspiracy to commit mail fraud. The mail fraud convictions (Counts Three through Ten) were based on eight separate membership dues checks, mailed between 2000 and 2002, the period during which Morales regularly transferred funds from FUPO's First Bank account to FUPO's BPPR account and then issued checks from FUPO's BPPR account to himself, De Jes&#250;s, or one of their personal interests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To demonstrate a violation of the mail fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1341, the prosecution must prove \"(1) the devising or attempting to devise a scheme or artifice to defraud; (2) the knowing and willing participation in the scheme with the specific intent to defraud; and (3) the use of the mails in furtherance of the scheme.\" <i>United States v. McCann,</i> 366 F.3d 46, 51 (1st Cir.2004) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), <i>vacated on other grounds, McCann v. United States,</i> 543 U.S. 1104, 125 S.Ct. 986, 160 L.Ed.2d 1017 (2005). The government must also show, \"in order to prove causation, that the defendant knew, or could have reasonably foreseen, that `the use of the mails [would] follow in the ordinary course of business.'\" <i>United States v. Pimental,</i> 380 F.3d 575, 584 (1st Cir.2004) (quoting <i>Pereira v. United States,</i> 347 U.S. 1, 9, 74 S.Ct. 358, 98 L.Ed. 435 (1954)). Finally, \"[i]t is not necessary to prove that the defendant personally executed the mailings, but merely that the defendant caused the mailing by doing some act from which it is reasonably foreseeable that the mails will be used.\" <i>Id.</i> (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the first requirement, we have held that \"[i]n order to find a `scheme to defraud,' the jury simply had to determine that [Morales] was attempting to `wrong[ ] one in his property rights by dishonest methods or schemes.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 585 (quoting <i>McNally v. United States,</i> 483 U.S. 350, 358, 107 S.Ct. 2875, 97 L.Ed.2d 292 (1987)). The facts of this case indicate that FUPO membership dues were misappropriated for the personal gain of Morales and De Jes&#250;s, rather than put to use for the intended purpose of improving the working conditions, professional growth, and legal resources of FUPO members. There is little doubt that a rational jury could find that Morales devised a scheme to defraud within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the second requirement of &#167; 1341, Morales does not contend &#8212; and the record does not suggest &#8212; that his participation was in any way unwilling or unknowing. Under the third requirement, a conviction for mail fraud must be supported by evidence that the mail was used in furtherance of the scheme. We have held that \"[t]he mailing `need not be an essential element of the scheme'; it can be merely `incident to an essential part of the scheme'\". <i>Id.</i> at 586 (quoting <i>Schmuck v. United States,</i> 489 U.S. 705, 710-11, 109 S.Ct. 1443, 103 L.Ed.2d 734 (1989)). Here, promotional materials sent by mail were used to recruit new members, whose dues &#8212; often sent by mail &#8212; Morales misappropriated. New members authorized the deduction of FUPO fees from their salaries via forms sent by mail, and Morales and De Jes&#250;s in turn sent letters to the relevant agencies, instructing that members' fees be deducted from their salaries, as authorized. It seems quite clear that a rational jury could deduce from these facts that mailing was at least \"incident to an essential part\" of the fraudulent scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, it is patently clear that a reasonable jury could have found that the use of the mail was foreseeable. In this circuit, \"it is simply the `use of the mails' in the course of the scheme rather than the particular mailing at issue that must be reasonably foreseeable for the causation element of a mail fraud offense to be satisfied.\" <i>Pimental,</i> 380 F.3d at 589. Once new members had authorized automatic deductions of their FUPO membership dues from their paychecks, FUPO would send a letter &#8212; <i>signed by Morales or De Jes&#250;s</i> &#8212; to the relevant agencies and municipalities. FUPO received some fifty checks per month in membership dues through the mail. Morales and De Jes&#250;s personally sorted through the mail received at FUPO, kept the checks, and handed over the remainder of the mail to Cabrera. We have no trouble concluding that a jury could have found the use of the mails to be reasonably foreseeable in the course of this scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales raises two arguments in support of his contention that the evidence was insufficient to support his mail fraud conviction. First, he claims that because FUPO is a charitable organization engaged in a lawful enterprise, the mail fraud statute is inapplicable. Second, he argues that because no witness testified at trial that he used the mail to defraud FUPO, no rational jury could have convicted him of mail fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of his contention that the mail fraud statute does not apply where funds were received through the mail by a legitimate non-profit organization and then misapplied by its officers, Morales cites only one fifty-year-old case from the Northern District of California. <i>United States v. Beall,</i> 126 F.Supp. 363 (N.D.Cal. 1954). This is not the law of our circuit, and Morales does not persuade us that it should be otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales next contends that because no witness testified at trial as to his use of the mail to further his fraudulent scheme, there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction as to the mail fraud charges. However, direct evidence is not necessary to prove mail fraud. <i>See Pimental,</i> 380 F.3d at 585. We find that the evidence was sufficient to support Morales's mail fraud conviction as to Counts Three through Ten.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To support a guilty verdict as to the conspiracy count under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371, the evidence must show beyond a reasonable doubt \"the existence of a conspiracy, the defendant's knowledge of it, and his voluntary participation in it.\" <i>United States v. Yefsky,</i> 994 F.2d 885, 890 (1st Cir.1993). To prove voluntary participation, \"the government must prove that the defendant had an intent to agree and an intent to effectuate the object of the conspiracy.\" <i>United States v. Royal,</i> 100 F.3d 1019, 1029 (1st Cir.1996). Further, \"when the commission of mail fraud is a goal of the conspiracy, the government must show either an intent to use the mails <i>or the reasonable foreseeability of such use.\" Yefsky,</i> 994 F.2d at 890 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidence introduced at trial revealed that Morales and De Jes&#250;s worked together to execute the fraud and that they kept it hidden from all other FUPO members and employees. Morales personally deposited membership checks in FUPO's First Bank account each week and issued checks to himself and De Jes&#250;s from FUPO's BPPR account every month. A reasonable jury could have found that there was a conspiracy, of which Morales was aware, and in which Morales participated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales claims that a conviction for conspiracy to commit mail fraud must be supported by a showing of an intent to use the mail to effect the scheme. This position is simply incorrect, as it directly contravenes the law of this circuit. The government need only show the reasonable foreseeability of the use of the mail in the execution of the conspiracy. <i>Id.; see also United States v. Dray,</i> 901 F.2d 1132, 1137 (1st Cir.1990); <i>United States v. Delgado Figueroa,</i> 832 F.2d 691, 696 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Counts Eleven and Twelve: Embezzlement of Labor Union Funds</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales claims there was no federal jurisdiction as to Counts Eleven and Twelve because they were based on the premise that FUPO is a labor organization engaged in an industry affecting interstate commerce, as defined by &#167; 402(j) of the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (\"LMRDA\"). Section &#167; 501(c) of the LMRDA is violated by \"[a]ny person who embezzles, steals, or unlawfully and willfully abstracts or converts to his own use, or the use of another, any of the moneys, funds, securities, property, or other assets of <i>a labor organization</i> of which he is an officer, or by which he is employed, directly or indirectly.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 501(c) (emphasis added). The term \"labor organization\" is defined by the LMRDA as an organization \"engaged in an industry <i>affecting commerce</i> and includes any organization . . . in which employees participate and which exists for the purpose, in whole or part, of dealing with employers . . .\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 402(i) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales appeals his conviction as to Counts Eleven and Twelve on the ground that FUPO is not a labor organization under the LMRDA because it is not \"engaged in an industry affecting commerce.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> For its part, the government does not respond to this argument at all.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The LMRDA deems a labor organization to be \"engaged in an industry affecting commerce\" if it</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) is the certified representative of employees under the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended [29 U.S.C.A. &#167; 151 et seq.], or the Railway Labor Act, as amended [45 U.S.C.A. &#167; 151 et seq.]; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) although not certified, is a national or international labor organization or a local labor organization recognized or acting as the representative of employees of an employer or employers engaged in an industry affecting commerce; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) has chartered a local labor organization or subsidiary body which is representing or actively seeking to represent employees of employers within the meaning of paragraph (1) or (2); or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(4) has been chartered by a labor organization representing or actively seeking to represent employees within the meaning of paragraph (1) or (2) as the local or subordinate body through which such employees may enjoy membership or become affiliated with such labor organization; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(5) is a conference, general committee, joint or system board, or joint council, subordinate to a national or international labor organization, which includes a labor organization engaged in an industry affecting commerce within the meaning of any of the preceding paragraphs of this subsection, other than a State or local central body.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 U.S.C. &#167; 402(j). Morales argues that FUPO does not meet any of the above requirements because the vast majority of FUPO's members are police officers employed by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and thus FUPO is not the representative of employees of an employer or employers engaged in an industry affecting commerce. The LMRDA defines the phrase \"industry affecting commerce\" as</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">any activity, business, or industry in commerce or in which a labor dispute would hinder or obstruct commerce or the free flow of commerce and includes any activity or industry \"affecting commerce\" within the meaning of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, as amended [29 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 141 <i>et seq.</i>], or the Railway Labor Act, as amended [45 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 151 <i>et seq.</i>].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 U.S.C. &#167; 402(c). At trial, the government presented evidence to the jury of FUPO's activities \"affecting commerce,\" consisting of the following: the majority of FUPO's members are members of the police force in Puerto Rico, which uses Smith and Wesson firearms, Crown Victoria cars, and helicopters, none of which are manufactured in Puerto Rico; and FUPO has six or seven dues-paying members who work for J.R. Bodyguard, a private security company that uses armored trucks purchased in Canada, cars manufactured by Suzuki, arms manufactured by Smith and Wesson, and which services national companies like Sam's Club and Office Max. Morales cites nary a case to support his contention that these activities do not constitute engagement in an industry affecting commerce and are thus not sufficient to qualify FUPO as a labor organization under the statute. Our standard of review constrains us to consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict. A reasonable jury could conclude that FUPO was sufficiently engaged in commerce to satisfy the statute, and we affirm Morales's conviction as to Counts Eleven and Twelve.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Count Thirteen: Structuring Monetary Transactions</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales argues that there was insufficient evidence to sustain his conviction for structuring monetary transactions. The Bank Secrecy Act requires domestic banks to report any transactions involving more than $10,000 in cash (such reports are known as cash transaction reports, or \"CTR\"). <i>See</i> 31 U.S.C. &#167; 5313. Further, \"[n]o person shall, for the purpose of evading the reporting requirements of section 5313(a) . . . structure or assist in structuring, or attempt to structure or assist in structuring, any transaction with one or more domestic financial institutions.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 5324(a)(3). The Supreme Court has defined structuring as \"to break up a single transaction above the reporting threshold into two or more separate transactions for the purpose of evading a financial institution's reporting requirement.\" <i>Ratzlaf v. United States,</i> 510 U.S. 135, 136, 114 S.Ct. 655, 126 L.Ed.2d 615 (1994). A person \"willfully violating\" this antistructuring provision is subject to criminal penalties. <i>See</i> 31 U.S.C. &#167; 5322.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales contends 1) that the evidence was insufficient because none of the government witnesses testified as to any willful violation of the structuring statute, and 2) that because the transactions in question involved checks, not cash, they do not fall within the ambit of 31 U.S.C. &#167; 5324.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidence introduced at trial reveals that BPPR never filed a CTR for any of Morales's transactions because he never issued a check in excess of $10,000, despite the fact that he often issued several checks to himself on the same day, whose total value exceeded that amount. Similarly, of the numerous handwritten checks made out to \"cash\" signed by Morales and drawn upon FUPO's First Bank account, none exceeded $10,000, even when the total value of checks cashed in a single day exceeded $10,000. Additionally, the checks that Morales's brothers cashed from FUPO's First Bank account never exceeded $10,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales maintains that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction because none of the government witnesses testified that Morales ever willfully caused a financial institution to fail to file a CTR. Although this argument is quite poorly developed, we assume that its intention is to suggest that his violation of &#167; 5324 was not willful. In <i>Ratzlaf,</i> the Supreme Court held that a structuring conviction requires a showing \"that the defendant acted with knowledge that his conduct was unlawful.\" 510 U.S. at 137, 114 S.Ct. 655. However, \"we previously have recognized that willfulness, as a state of mind, can rarely be proved by [direct] evidence; instead, `it is usually established by drawing reasonable inferences from the available facts.'\" <i>United States v. Marder,</i> 48 F.3d 564, 574 (1st Cir.1995) (quoting <i>United States v. Bank of New England, N.A.,</i> 821 F.2d 844, 854 (1st Cir.1987)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict, we have no doubt that the evidence presented in this case would permit a rational jury to find that Morales wilfully violated the anti-structuring statute. During the period between January 2000 and December 2002, Morales prepared dozens of BPPR checks, drawn against FUPO's account and made out to cash, for a total value of well over $1,000,000. Not a single check exceeded $10,000 in value. The deliberate and specific avoidance of the $10,000 threshold over a period of almost three years would, in our view, permit a jury to conclude that Morales was aware of the legal consequences of his actions. Further, a rational jury could surely have found that Morales knew his conduct was unlawful in light of the fact that he concealed his actions from FUPO's leaders, high-ranking officers, and finance personnel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales next argues that the transactions that served as the basis for his conviction do not come within the ambit of sections 5314 and 5324 of Title 31 because they involved checks and not cash. This argument fails because many of the transactions in question involved cashing checks, such that Morales &#8212; or someone sent on his behalf &#8212; would routinely exit the bank with thousands of dollars in cash. We have observed that \"[t]he most common method of `structuring' is to divide sums of cash into amounts that are either under the $10,000 reporting threshold or into amounts that are larger but still less likely to attract attention.\" <i>United States v. Hurley,</i> 63 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir.1995). The evidence in this case suggests that Morales acted exactly as <i>Hurley</i> describes. Morales develops no argument as to why this activity does not fall within the purview of the Bank Secrecy Act, which \"requires domestic banks to report <i>any transactions involving</i> more than $10,000 in cash.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added). We find that his activity was exactly the sort that 31 U.S.C. &#167; 5324(a)(3) proscribes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4.

To find Morales guilty, the jury had to find that the government proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Morales conspired with De Jes&#250;s to commit the offense of money laundering, which is comprised of four elements:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) that [Morales] knowingly conducted a financial transaction, (2) that he knew the transaction involved funds that were the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity, (3) that the funds involved were in fact the proceeds of a specified unlawful activity, and (4) that [Morales] engaged in the financial transaction knowing that it was designed in whole or in part to conceal or disguise the nature, location, source, ownership, or control of the proceeds of such unlawful activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v.

That section defines a financial transaction as</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(A) a transaction which in any way or degree <i>affects interstate or foreign commerce</i> (i) involving the movement of funds by wire or other means or (ii) involving <i>one or more monetary instruments,</i> or (iii) involving the transfer of title to any real property, vehicle, vessel, or aircraft, or (B) <i>a transaction involving the use of a financial institution which is engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce in any way or degree;</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(c)(4) (emphases added). Morales only addresses part (A), claiming that he was involved in no transaction that affected interstate or foreign commerce. He entirely ignores the remainder of this subsection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we accept, <i>arguendo,</i> Morales's contention that he was involved in no financial transaction affecting interstate commerce within the meaning of subsection (A), we find that a jury could have determined that he was involved in financial transactions as defined in subsection (B). The government's case included evidence that Morales and De Jes&#250;s retained exclusive control of the membership dues checks received by mail, that they deposited the majority of the checks so received in FUPO's First Bank account each month, that they then transferred funds &#8212; using manager's checks &#8212; from FUPO's First Bank account to its BPPR account, and that Morales and De Jes&#250;s regularly issued checks to themselves from the BPPR account. Each of these actions &#8212; depositing checks at a bank, transferring funds from one bank to another, and issuing checks &#8212; involved one or more financial institutions engaged in interstate commerce. Given these facts, we think a rational jury could easily have found that Morales conducted a financial transaction within the plain meaning of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(c)(4)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales next challenges the sufficiency of the government's evidence as to the fourth element of the <i>Cruzado-Laureano</i> test, claiming that \"absolutely no evidence\" &#8212; either direct or circumstantial &#8212; was presented at trial to establish that he engaged in any financial transaction knowing that it was designed in whole or in part to conceal or disguise the nature, location, source, ownership, or control of the proceeds of such unlawful activity. Morales points to <i>United States v. Dimeck,</i> 24 F.3d 1239 (10th Cir.1994), to support his argument that, even if the checks that he issued to himself and De Jes&#250;s were the proceeds of illegal activity, his activities did not constitute money laundering. In <i>Dimeck,</i> the court found that the mere transportation of concealed drug money did not constitute money laundering because the money laundering statute \"was designed to punish those ... who thereafter take the additional step of attempting to legitimize their proceeds so that observers think their money is derived from legal enterprises.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1247. We find the facts of <i>Dimeck</i> to be easily distinguishable from the present case. The facts, when considered in a light most favorable to the verdict, suggest that Morales did far more than simply transport ill-gotten wealth. A rational jury could have found the evidence sufficient to indicate that Morales's monthly secretive transfer of FUPO membership funds between three separate bank accounts &#8212; FUPO's First Bank account, FUPO's BPPR account, and Morales's personal BPPR account &#8212; was an attempt to conceal the nature, location, source, ownership, and control of proceeds. Further, a jury could have found that Morales's practice of limiting the value of each check issued to himself or De Jes&#250;s to $10,000 so as to avoid bank reporting, indicates an effort to conceal the true nature, source, and ownership of the proceeds. Specifically, we think it quite clear that a jury could have found that these complicated machinations were intended to create the appearance of legitimate income.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Morales suggests that the evidence at trial was insufficient to support his conviction because no government witness directly testified as to his participation in any money laundering activity. However, we have held that circumstantial evidence can be sufficient to support a money laundering conviction. <i>Cruzado-Laureano,</i> 404 F.3d at 483 (\"A conviction requires evidence of intent to disguise or conceal the transaction, whether from direct evidence, like the defendant's own statements, or from circumstantial evidence, like the use of a third party to disguise the true owner, or unusual secrecy.\"). In this instance, the lack of direct evidence is a direct result of the secret conspiracy between Morales and De Jes&#250;s. The fact that only Morales and De Jes&#250;s knew of the scheme only emphasizes its secretive nature and the deceit involved with its execution. Everyone else at FUPO &#8212; from top-level officers to administrative secretaries &#8212; was kept in the dark. For these reasons, we find that a rational jury could have found the evidence at trial sufficient to convict Morales of conspiracy to commit money laundering.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Brady</i> Violation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales argues that the government breached its duty under <i>Brady v. Maryland,</i> 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), to provide him with exculpatory evidence in its possession. On August 18, 2003, Morales filed a motion requesting any exculpatory information from the government, consistent with <i>Brady.</i> On August 25, the district court granted the motion. By letter dated August 26, the government noted that \"[a]s of this date, no exculpatory evidence has been uncovered,\" but promised to \"provide any exculpatory evidences which may be uncovered in the future.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales maintains that, at the time of the prosecution's August 26 letter, the government was already in possession of exculpatory evidence that it failed to disclose, in violation of <i>Brady.</i> The evidence in question was the contents of two FBI reports detailing interviews with De Jes&#250;s. In those reports, De Jes&#250;s stated &#8212; among other things &#8212; that he had won approximately $2.5 million over the course of three years in a horse race, which had enabled him to regularly loan money to FUPO. Specifically, he said that during an approximately three-year period, he had lent more than $300,000 to FUPO, and that Morales had lent FUPO $75,000. De Jes&#250;s explained that the money he and Morales took from FUPO's bank accounts constituted repayment of the loans. As evidence, De Jes&#250;s presented copies of two cancelled checks, dated 1998 and 1999, drawn on his personal account and made out to FUPO for $50,000 and $100,000 respectively. Morales claims that the government never informed him of the contents of these reports or of the two cancelled checks. He argues that this information was material and exculpatory because it provided a legitimate explanation for his appropriation of FUPO's funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An alleged <i>Brady</i> violation must satisfy three elements: \"The evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory, or because it is impeaching; that evidence must have been suppressed by the State, either willfully or inadvertently; and prejudice must have ensued.\" <i>Strickler v. Greene,</i> 527 U.S. 263, 281-82, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999). We review the district court's denial of a motion for a new trial on the basis of alleged <i>Brady</i> violations for manifest abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Hansen,</i> 434 F.3d 92, 102 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales claims that all three prongs are satisfied because the information was exculpatory, the prosecution suppressed it, and there was a reasonable probability that the verdict would have been different if the evidence had been disclosed to the jury. We consider each element in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales claims that the evidence was exculpatory because it provided a legitimate explanation for his activities. We disagree. Even assuming the credibility of De Jes&#250;s's statements regarding his loan to FUPO of $300,000 and Morales's loan of $75,000, there still remains $2.4 million of FUPO funds unaccounted for. Further, the allegedly exculpatory reports include many statements by De Jes&#250;s, ignored in Morales's brief, that are actually <i>incriminating</i> to Morales. For example, the report reflects 1) that De Jes&#250;s admits that \"he kept writing checks to himself and Morales after he felt that he had repaid himself for the loans\"; 2) that De Jes&#250;s and Morales continued writing checks to themselves because \"they started the organization and they looked on it as their own money\"; 3) that they always wrote the checks for $10,000 or less \"so that they could avoid notification to Hacienda and the federal reporting requirements\"; 4) that De Jes&#250;s never reported the money he took from FUPO to Hacienda on his tax returns and does not believe Morales did either; 5) that De Jes&#250;s believes that he has taken between $1 million and $1.5 million from FUPO in addition to what he claims to have lent the organization; and 6) that De Jes&#250;s believes Morales used the funds to open and support several security businesses. Although we are not convinced that this evidence was exculpatory, we proceed to the second prong of <i>Brady.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under <i>Brady,</i> the government is obligated to disclose exculpatory evidence. 373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194. Assuming that the evidence in question is exculpatory, we find no <i>Brady</i> violation because the government did not suppress it. The government allowed the defense to conduct open-file discovery of all documents in its possession, which included the FBI reports of De Jes&#250;s's statements, which the government requested to be returned only after the defense had an opportunity to read them. At sentencing, the district judge found unpersuasive Morales's claim that the government requested the return of the documents before the defense had an opportunity to read all of them. We find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, a valid <i>Brady</i> claim requires a showing that the evidence in question was material. The Supreme Court has made quite clear that, for <i>Brady</i> purposes, \"[t]he evidence is material only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\" <i>United States v. Bagley,</i> 473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985). We find that the proffered evidence was not material. The evidence against Morales was very strong, and De Jes&#250;s's statements contained within the allegedly exculpatory FBI reports only served to corroborate the prosecution's theory of the case. Further, even if credible, De Jes&#250;s's explanation of the scheme leaves almost $2.5 million unaccounted for. We find no <i>Brady</i> violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Sentencing Guidelines</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales contends that the district court improperly delegated its sentencing authority when it imposed a supervised release condition requiring Morales to submit to a drug test within fifteen days of release, and thereafter to random drug testing not to exceed 104 samples per year. Morales claims that this condition warrants remand for re-sentencing in light of <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales did not preserve his <i>Booker</i> claim below, and thus our review is for plain error. <i>See United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d 68, 75 (1st Cir.2005). Similarly, Morales did not object to the supervised release conditions at sentencing, and our review of that issue is for plain error. <i>See United States v. Padilla,</i> 415 F.3d 211, 218 (1st Cir.2005) (en banc). In order for us to correct an error to which there was no objection in the district court, \"[t]here must be an `error' that is `plain' and that `affect[s] substantial rights.'\" <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 77 (quoting <i>United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales claims that the supervised release terms were an impermissible delegation of judicial authority. Morales specifically claims that the supervised release terms allowed the probation officer to decide the number of drug tests to which he would need to submit. It is the law of this circuit that, in stipulating the terms of a supervised release provision, a sentencing judge \"may not ... vest the probation officer with the discretion to order an unlimited number of drug tests.\" <i>United States v. Melendez-Santana,</i> 353 F.3d 93, 103 (1st Cir.2003), <i>rev'd on other grounds, Padilla,</i> 415 F.3d at 215. However, Morales's claim fails because no such delegation actually occurred in this case. At sentencing, the judge ordered Morales to</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">refrain from the unlawful use of controlled substances and submit to drug testing within fifteen days of release. Thereafter submit to random drug tests not to exceed 104 samples per year, in accordance with the drug after care program policy of the U.S. probation office, approved by this Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The probation officer did not have unlimited discretion to order an unlimited number of tests. Rather, the sentencing judge clearly established an upper limit to the number of drug tests that can properly be ordered upon Morales's release. In a recent case raising almost the identical issue, we held that where, as here, the \"district court itself required that defendant submit to random drug testing `not to exceed 104 samples per year,'\" there was no delegation error. <i>United States v. Laureano-Ve&#233;z,</i> 424 F.3d 38, 41 (1st Cir.2005). Because we find no error, we need not reach the other prongs of plain error review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales next maintains that the supervised release condition warrants remand in light of <i>Booker.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The government concedes that the district court treated the sentencing guidelines as mandatory. In <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> we held that \"[t]he first two <i>Olano</i> requirements &#8212; that an error exists and that it is plain at the time of appeal &#8212; are satisfied whenever the district court treated the Guidelines as mandatory at the time of sentencing.\" 399 F.3d at 75. Under the third prong we ask \"whether [Morales has] pointed to circumstances that create a reasonable probability that the district court would have imposed a more lenient sentence had the guidelines been advisory.\" <i>United States v. S&#225;nchez-Berr&#237;os,</i> 424 F.3d 65, 80 (1st Cir. 2005). Morales has made no such showing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.

Because Morales does not challenge FUPO's status as a labor union with respect to this requirement, we consider the argument waived. <i>See, e.g., Am. Cyanamid Co. v.

He was accused of conspiracy to commit mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371 (Count One); mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1341 (Counts Two through Ten); embezzlement of labor union funds, in violation of 29 U.S.C. &#167; 501(c) (Counts Eleven and Twelve); structuring money transactions, in violation of 31 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 5322(b) and 5324(3) and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2 (Count Thirteen); and conspiracy to commit money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(h) (Count Fourteen).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 12, 2004, after a six-day jury trial, Morales was found guilty of all charges except for Count Two. On September 23, he filed a motion requesting a new trial, but this was denied. He was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 121 months as to Counts Three through Ten, and Counts Thirteen and Fourteen. He was sentenced to a term of five years as to Counts One, Eleven, and Twelve. All sentences were to be served concurrently. Additionally, the district court imposed a supervised release condition requiring Morales to submit to a drug test within fifteen days of release and thereafter to random drug testing not to exceed 104 samples per year. On October 4, 2004, Morales filed this appeal, challenging both his convictions and his sentence. After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From 1992 to 2003, Morales was Vice-President of Frente Unido de Polic&#237;as Organizados (\"FUPO\"), and Jos&#233; De Jes&#250;s-Serrano (\"De Jes&#250;s\") was FUPO's President. FUPO was a not-for-profit organization open to police officers and security guards, whose goal was to offer better working conditions and salaries for its members, as well as to provide legal representation in civil and criminal cases against its members.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Through various outreach efforts including promotional materials sent by mail, FUPO made constant efforts to recruit new members. New members filled out forms to authorize the payment of FUPO membership fees through automatic deductions from their salaries. Members either personally delivered these forms to FUPO's offices or sent them by mail. Once FUPO was in possession of a new member form, a letter signed by either Morales or De Jes&#250;s would be sent by mail to the relevant agencies and municipalities, authorizing the deduction of FUPO membership fees from the new member's salary. Once deducted, membership fees were sent to FUPO by mail. FUPO received some fifty checks for membership fees each month by mail, and all checks were handled personally by Morales or De Jes&#250;s. Membership cards that were not picked up at FUPO's offices were sent by mail. In the years 2002 and 2003, FUPO's membership reached approximately 18,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Around the year 2000, members began to complain that promised services and benefits were not being delivered. One of the ostensible benefits of FUPO membership was that the organization assumed responsibility for members' attorneys' fees. It seems that when members availed themselves of attorney services, it was customary for the attorneys to send the invoices directly to FUPO. The checks were then prepared by Madeline Cabrera (\"Cabrera\") but were not actually sent until so authorized by Morales or De Jes&#250;s. Typically, FUPO prepared checks for attorneys' fees totaling $70,000 to $80,000 per month. Around the year 2000, payments made for attorneys' fees declined, even though the invoice amounts actually increased. Although it appears that the checks were being prepared, they were not always sent. Many members complained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also in the year 2000, members began to complain about FUPO's failure to provide other promised services. Some members who were suspended from work complained that they were not being paid the money FUPO had promised in the event of suspension. Widows complained that they were not receiving the promised $2000 death benefit. Payments of disability benefits were delayed. At least one FUPO area director informed De Jes&#250;s and Morales about these problems, but the problems persisted. When Cabrera became FUPO's Executive Secretary in 2003, she discovered that, while De Jes&#250;s was President and Morales Vice-President, FUPO had fallen several years behind in its payments of disability benefits and in its payments to the IRS, Hacienda (Treasury of Puerto Rico), and bank credit lines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FUPO had a bank account at First Bank in Puerto Rico. Morales visited the bank each week. There, he deposited checks made out to FUPO, and because they were issued by various government agencies (police force, fire department, etc.), they cleared immediately. Copies of checks and transaction records introduced at trial indicate that after depositing the checks, Morales then would purchase a manager's check, made out to FUPO, for part of the deposit amount. As for the remainder, he would ask the bank to issue a check against FUPO's account, made out to \"cash\" for a specified amount (never exceeding $10,000). After the bank prepared the check, Morales would cash it and take the cash with him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FUPO also had a bank account at Banco Popular de Puerto Rico (\"BPPR\"), opened by Morales and De Jes&#250;s. Morales went to BPPR approximately once a month to deposit the First Bank manager's checks that were made out to FUPO. Then, Morales would issue checks from FUPO's BPPR bank account to himself, to his company (J.R. Bodyguard), and to De Jes&#250;s. No single check was ever issued in an amount exceeding $10,000, despite the fact that Morales often issued several checks to himself in the same day whose total amount exceeded $10,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Typically, the total value of all checks issued to Morales was between $8,000 and $67,000 per month (totaling more than one million dollars during the course of three years),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> while those issued to De Jes&#250;s ranged from $7,000 to $95,000 per month (totaling more than $1.5 million during the same period).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Morales and De Jes&#250;s used these funds for personal expenses, including payment of personal credit card bills.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales and De Jes&#250;s concealed the scheme, which was repeated each month from January 2000 to December 2002, from other FUPO employees including administrative secretary Joanna Lind (\"Lind\"), who was in charge of FUPO's monthly expenses, and H&#233;ctor Navarro-Matos (\"Navarro\"), who was responsible for filing various FUPO financial reports with the Departments of State and Labor. Also unaware of the fraud was Angel Troche (\"Troche\"), one of the founders and leaders of FUPO. Troche did not know FUPO was issuing checks to \"cash.\" In fact, neither he nor any of the other directors ever gained access to FUPO's account books.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Analysis</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction for mail fraud, conspiracy to commit mail fraud, embezzlement, structuring monetary transactions, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. We consider them seriatim. To assess a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, \"we `review the record to determine whether the evidence and reasonable inferences therefrom, taken as a whole and in the light most favorable to the prosecution, would allow a rational jury to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendants were guilty as charged.'\" <i>United States v.

The mail fraud convictions (Counts Three through Ten) were based on eight separate membership dues checks, mailed between 2000 and 2002, the period during which Morales regularly transferred funds from FUPO's First Bank account to FUPO's BPPR account and then issued checks from FUPO's BPPR account to himself, De Jes&#250;s, or one of their personal interests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To demonstrate a violation of the mail fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1341, the prosecution must prove \"(1) the devising or attempting to devise a scheme or artifice to defraud; (2) the knowing and willing participation in the scheme with the specific intent to defraud; and (3) the use of the mails in furtherance of the scheme.\" <i>United States v.

The facts of this case indicate that FUPO membership dues were misappropriated for the personal gain of Morales and De Jes&#250;s, rather than put to use for the intended purpose of improving the working conditions, professional growth, and legal resources of FUPO members. There is little doubt that a rational jury could find that Morales devised a scheme to defraud within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the second requirement of &#167; 1341, Morales does not contend &#8212; and the record does not suggest &#8212; that his participation was in any way unwilling or unknowing. Under the third requirement, a conviction for mail fraud must be supported by evidence that the mail was used in furtherance of the scheme. We have held that \"[t]he mailing `need not be an essential element of the scheme'; it can be merely `incident to an essential part of the scheme'\". <i>Id.</i> at 586 (quoting <i>Schmuck v.

Here, promotional materials sent by mail were used to recruit new members, whose dues &#8212; often sent by mail &#8212; Morales misappropriated. New members authorized the deduction of FUPO fees from their salaries via forms sent by mail, and Morales and De Jes&#250;s in turn sent letters to the relevant agencies, instructing that members' fees be deducted from their salaries, as authorized. It seems quite clear that a rational jury could deduce from these facts that mailing was at least \"incident to an essential part\" of the fraudulent scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, it is patently clear that a reasonable jury could have found that the use of the mail was foreseeable. In this circuit, \"it is simply the `use of the mails' in the course of the scheme rather than the particular mailing at issue that must be reasonably foreseeable for the causation element of a mail fraud offense to be satisfied.\" <i>Pimental,</i> 380 F.3d at 589. Once new members had authorized automatic deductions of their FUPO membership dues from their paychecks, FUPO would send a letter &#8212; <i>signed by Morales or De Jes&#250;s</i> &#8212; to the relevant agencies and municipalities. FUPO received some fifty checks per month in membership dues through the mail. Morales and De Jes&#250;s personally sorted through the mail received at FUPO, kept the checks, and handed over the remainder of the mail to Cabrera. We have no trouble concluding that a jury could have found the use of the mails to be reasonably foreseeable in the course of this scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales raises two arguments in support of his contention that the evidence was insufficient to support his mail fraud conviction. First, he claims that because FUPO is a charitable organization engaged in a lawful enterprise, the mail fraud statute is inapplicable. Second, he argues that because no witness testified at trial that he used the mail to defraud FUPO, no rational jury could have convicted him of mail fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of his contention that the mail fraud statute does not apply where funds were received through the mail by a legitimate non-profit organization and then misapplied by its officers, Morales cites only one fifty-year-old case from the Northern District of California. <i>United States v. Beall,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1624849\"><a href=\"/opinion/1624849/united-states-v-beall/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

At trial, the government presented evidence to the jury of FUPO's activities \"affecting commerce,\" consisting of the following: the majority of FUPO's members are members of the police force in Puerto Rico, which uses Smith and Wesson firearms, Crown Victoria cars, and helicopters, none of which are manufactured in Puerto Rico; and FUPO has six or seven dues-paying members who work for J.R. Bodyguard, a private security company that uses armored trucks purchased in Canada, cars manufactured by Suzuki, arms manufactured by Smith and Wesson, and which services national companies like Sam's Club and Office Max. Morales cites nary a case to support his contention that these activities do not constitute engagement in an industry affecting commerce and are thus not sufficient to qualify FUPO as a labor organization under the statute. Our standard of review constrains us to consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict. A reasonable jury could conclude that FUPO was sufficiently engaged in commerce to satisfy the statute, and we affirm Morales's conviction as to Counts Eleven and Twelve.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3.

Similarly, of the numerous handwritten checks made out to \"cash\" signed by Morales and drawn upon FUPO's First Bank account, none exceeded $10,000, even when the total value of checks cashed in a single day exceeded $10,000. Additionally, the checks that Morales's brothers cashed from FUPO's First Bank account never exceeded $10,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales maintains that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction because none of the government witnesses testified that Morales ever willfully caused a financial institution to fail to file a CTR. Although this argument is quite poorly developed, we assume that its intention is to suggest that his violation of &#167; 5324 was not willful. In <i>Ratzlaf,</i> the Supreme Court held that a structuring conviction requires a showing \"that the defendant acted with knowledge that his conduct was unlawful.\" 510 U.S. at 137, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112919\"><a href=\"/opinion/112919/ratzlaf-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

During the period between January 2000 and December 2002, Morales prepared dozens of BPPR checks, drawn against FUPO's account and made out to cash, for a total value of well over $1,000,000. Not a single check exceeded $10,000 in value. The deliberate and specific avoidance of the $10,000 threshold over a period of almost three years would, in our view, permit a jury to conclude that Morales was aware of the legal consequences of his actions. Further, a rational jury could surely have found that Morales knew his conduct was unlawful in light of the fact that he concealed his actions from FUPO's leaders, high-ranking officers, and finance personnel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales next argues that the transactions that served as the basis for his conviction do not come within the ambit of sections 5314 and 5324 of Title 31 because they involved checks and not cash. This argument fails because many of the transactions in question involved cashing checks, such that Morales &#8212; or someone sent on his behalf &#8212; would routinely exit the bank with thousands of dollars in cash. We have observed that \"[t]he most common method of `structuring' is to divide sums of cash into amounts that are either under the $10,000 reporting threshold or into amounts that are larger but still less likely to attract attention.\" <i>United States v.

The evidence in this case suggests that Morales acted exactly as <i>Hurley</i> describes. Morales develops no argument as to why this activity does not fall within the purview of the Bank Secrecy Act, which \"requires domestic banks to report <i>any transactions involving</i> more than $10,000 in cash.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added).

That section defines a financial transaction as</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(A) a transaction which in any way or degree <i>affects interstate or foreign commerce</i> (i) involving the movement of funds by wire or other means or (ii) involving <i>one or more monetary instruments,</i> or (iii) involving the transfer of title to any real property, vehicle, vessel, or aircraft, or (B) <i>a transaction involving the use of a financial institution which is engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce in any way or degree;</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(c)(4) (emphases added). Morales only addresses part (A), claiming that he was involved in no transaction that affected interstate or foreign commerce. He entirely ignores the remainder of this subsection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we accept, <i>arguendo,</i> Morales's contention that he was involved in no financial transaction affecting interstate commerce within the meaning of subsection (A), we find that a jury could have determined that he was involved in financial transactions as defined in subsection (B). The government's case included evidence that Morales and De Jes&#250;s retained exclusive control of the membership dues checks received by mail, that they deposited the majority of the checks so received in FUPO's First Bank account each month, that they then transferred funds &#8212; using manager's checks &#8212; from FUPO's First Bank account to its BPPR account, and that Morales and De Jes&#250;s regularly issued checks to themselves from the BPPR account. Each of these actions &#8212; depositing checks at a bank, transferring funds from one bank to another, and issuing checks &#8212; involved one or more financial institutions engaged in interstate commerce. Given these facts, we think a rational jury could easily have found that Morales conducted a financial transaction within the plain meaning of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(c)(4)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales next challenges the sufficiency of the government's evidence as to the fourth element of the <i>Cruzado-Laureano</i> test, claiming that \"absolutely no evidence\" &#8212; either direct or circumstantial &#8212; was presented at trial to establish that he engaged in any financial transaction knowing that it was designed in whole or in part to conceal or disguise the nature, location, source, ownership, or control of the proceeds of such unlawful activity. Morales points to <i>United States v. Dimeck,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"670621\"><a href=\"/opinion/670621/united-states-v-kevin-j-dimeck/\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1239</span></a></span> (10th Cir.1994), to support his argument that, even if the checks that he issued to himself and De Jes&#250;s were the proceeds of illegal activity, his activities did not constitute money laundering. In <i>Dimeck,</i> the court found that the mere transportation of concealed drug money did not constitute money laundering because the money laundering statute \"was designed to punish those ... who thereafter take the additional step of attempting to legitimize their proceeds so that observers think their money is derived from legal enterprises.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1247. We find the facts of <i>Dimeck</i> to be easily distinguishable from the present case. The facts, when considered in a light most favorable to the verdict, suggest that Morales did far more than simply transport ill-gotten wealth. A rational jury could have found the evidence sufficient to indicate that Morales's monthly secretive transfer of FUPO membership funds between three separate bank accounts &#8212; FUPO's First Bank account, FUPO's BPPR account, and Morales's personal BPPR account &#8212; was an attempt to conceal the nature, location, source, ownership, and control of proceeds. Further, a jury could have found that Morales's practice of limiting the value of each check issued to himself or De Jes&#250;s to $10,000 so as to avoid bank reporting, indicates an effort to conceal the true nature, source, and ownership of the proceeds. Specifically, we think it quite clear that a jury could have found that these complicated machinations were intended to create the appearance of legitimate income.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Morales suggests that the evidence at trial was insufficient to support his conviction because no government witness directly testified as to his participation in any money laundering activity. However, we have held that circumstantial evidence can be sufficient to support a money laundering conviction. <i>Cruzado-Laureano,</i> 404 F.3d at 483 (\"A conviction requires evidence of intent to disguise or conceal the transaction, whether from direct evidence, like the defendant's own statements, or from circumstantial evidence, like the use of a third party to disguise the true owner, or unusual secrecy.\"). In this instance, the lack of direct evidence is a direct result of the secret conspiracy between Morales and De Jes&#250;s. The fact that only Morales and De Jes&#250;s knew of the scheme only emphasizes its secretive nature and the deceit involved with its execution. Everyone else at FUPO &#8212; from top-level officers to administrative secretaries &#8212; was kept in the dark. For these reasons, we find that a rational jury could have found the evidence at trial sufficient to convict Morales of conspiracy to commit money laundering.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Brady</i> Violation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales argues that the government breached its duty under <i>Brady v.

On August 18, 2003, Morales filed a motion requesting any exculpatory information from the government, consistent with <i>Brady.</i> On August 25, the district court granted the motion. By letter dated August 26, the government noted that \"[a]s of this date, no exculpatory evidence has been uncovered,\" but promised to \"provide any exculpatory evidences which may be uncovered in the future.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales maintains that, at the time of the prosecution's August 26 letter, the government was already in possession of exculpatory evidence that it failed to disclose, in violation of <i>Brady.</i> The evidence in question was the contents of two FBI reports detailing interviews with De Jes&#250;s. In those reports, De Jes&#250;s stated &#8212; among other things &#8212; that he had won approximately $2.5 million over the course of three years in a horse race, which had enabled him to regularly loan money to FUPO. Specifically, he said that during an approximately three-year period, he had lent more than $300,000 to FUPO, and that Morales had lent FUPO $75,000. De Jes&#250;s explained that the money he and Morales took from FUPO's bank accounts constituted repayment of the loans. As evidence, De Jes&#250;s presented copies of two cancelled checks, dated 1998 and 1999, drawn on his personal account and made out to FUPO for $50,000 and $100,000 respectively. Morales claims that the government never informed him of the contents of these reports or of the two cancelled checks. He argues that this information was material and exculpatory because it provided a legitimate explanation for his appropriation of FUPO's funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An alleged <i>Brady</i> violation must satisfy three elements: \"The evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory, or because it is impeaching; that evidence must have been suppressed by the State, either willfully or inadvertently; and prejudice must have ensued.\" <i>Strickler v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">286</span></a></span> (1999). We review the district court's denial of a motion for a new trial on the basis of alleged <i>Brady</i> violations for manifest abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Hansen,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202016\"><a href=\"/opinion/202016/united-states-v-hansen/\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">92</span></a></span>, 102 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales claims that all three prongs are satisfied because the information was exculpatory, the prosecution suppressed it, and there was a reasonable probability that the verdict would have been different if the evidence had been disclosed to the jury. We consider each element in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales claims that the evidence was exculpatory because it provided a legitimate explanation for his activities. We disagree. Even assuming the credibility of De Jes&#250;s's statements regarding his loan to FUPO of $300,000 and Morales's loan of $75,000, there still remains $2.4 million of FUPO funds unaccounted for. Further, the allegedly exculpatory reports include many statements by De Jes&#250;s, ignored in Morales's brief, that are actually <i>incriminating</i> to Morales. For example, the report reflects 1) that De Jes&#250;s admits that \"he kept writing checks to himself and Morales after he felt that he had repaid himself for the loans\"; 2) that De Jes&#250;s and Morales continued writing checks to themselves because \"they started the organization and they looked on it as their own money\"; 3) that they always wrote the checks for $10,000 or less \"so that they could avoid notification to Hacienda and the federal reporting requirements\"; 4) that De Jes&#250;s never reported the money he took from FUPO to Hacienda on his tax returns and does not believe Morales did either; 5) that De Jes&#250;s believes that he has taken between $1 million and $1.5 million from FUPO in addition to what he claims to have lent the organization; and 6) that De Jes&#250;s believes Morales used the funds to open and support several security businesses. Although we are not convinced that this evidence was exculpatory, we proceed to the second prong of <i>Brady.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under <i>Brady,</i> the government is obligated to disclose exculpatory evidence. 373 U.S. at 87, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1194</span></a></span>. Assuming that the evidence in question is exculpatory, we find no <i>Brady</i> violation because the government did not suppress it. The government allowed the defense to conduct open-file discovery of all documents in its possession, which included the FBI reports of De Jes&#250;s's statements, which the government requested to be returned only after the defense had an opportunity to read them. At sentencing, the district judge found unpersuasive Morales's claim that the government requested the return of the documents before the defense had an opportunity to read all of them. We find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, a valid <i>Brady</i> claim requires a showing that the evidence in question was material. The Supreme Court has made quite clear that, for <i>Brady</i> purposes, \"[t]he evidence is material only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\" <i>United States v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">481</span></a></span> (1985). We find that the proffered evidence was not material. The evidence against Morales was very strong, and De Jes&#250;s's statements contained within the allegedly exculpatory FBI reports only served to corroborate the prosecution's theory of the case. Further, even if credible, De Jes&#250;s's explanation of the scheme leaves almost $2.5 million unaccounted for. We find no <i>Brady</i> violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Sentencing Guidelines</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales contends that the district court improperly delegated its sentencing authority when it imposed a supervised release condition requiring Morales to submit to a drug test within fifteen days of release, and thereafter to random drug testing not to exceed 104 samples per year. Morales claims that this condition warrants remand for re-sentencing in light of <i>United States v. Booker,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Similarly, Morales did not object to the supervised release conditions at sentencing, and our review of that issue is for plain error. <i>See United States v. Padilla,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201389\"><a href=\"/opinion/201389/united-states-v-padilla/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">211</span></a></span>, 218 (1st Cir.2005) (en banc). In order for us to correct an error to which there was no objection in the district court, \"[t]here must be an `error' that is `plain' and that `affect[s] substantial rights.'\" <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 77 (quoting <i>United States v.

Morales specifically claims that the supervised release terms allowed the probation officer to decide the number of drug tests to which he would need to submit. It is the law of this circuit that, in stipulating the terms of a supervised release provision, a sentencing judge \"may not ... vest the probation officer with the discretion to order an unlimited number of drug tests.\" <i>United States v. Melendez-Santana,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200784\"><a href=\"/opinion/200784/united-states-v-melendez-santana/\"><span class=\"volume\">353</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></a></span>, 103 (1st Cir.2003), <i>rev'd on other grounds, Padilla,</i> 415 F.3d at 215. However, Morales's claim fails because no such delegation actually occurred in this case. At sentencing, the judge ordered Morales to</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">refrain from the unlawful use of controlled substances and submit to drug testing within fifteen days of release. Thereafter submit to random drug tests not to exceed 104 samples per year, in accordance with the drug after care program policy of the U.S. probation office, approved by this Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The probation officer did not have unlimited discretion to order an unlimited number of tests. Rather, the sentencing judge clearly established an upper limit to the number of drug tests that can properly be ordered upon Morales's release. In a recent case raising almost the identical issue, we held that where, as here, the \"district court itself required that defendant submit to random drug testing `not to exceed 104 samples per year,'\" there was no delegation error. <i>United States v. Laureano-Ve&#233;z,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201820\"><a href=\"/opinion/201820/united-states-v-laureano-velez/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span>, 41 (1st Cir.2005). Because we find no error, we need not reach the other prongs of plain error review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales next maintains that the supervised release condition warrants remand in light of <i>Booker.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The government concedes that the district court treated the sentencing guidelines as mandatory. In <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> we held that \"[t]he first two <i>Olano</i> requirements &#8212; that an error exists and that it is plain at the time of appeal &#8212; are satisfied whenever the district court treated the Guidelines as mandatory at the time of sentencing.\" 399 F.3d at 75. Under the third prong we ask \"whether [Morales has] pointed to circumstances that create a reasonable probability that the district court would have imposed a more lenient sentence had the guidelines been advisory.\" <i>United States v. S&#225;nchez-Berr&#237;os,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201833\"><a href=\"/opinion/201833/united-states-v-sanchez-berrios/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span></a></span>, 80 (1st Cir. 2005).

However, Morales was convicted under LMRDA, a federal statute. Morales develops no argument as to why Puerto Rico law &#8212; rather than federal law &#8212; should control this case, and we consider this line of inquiry no further</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Instead, the government inexplicably focuses on an altogether separate component of the definition of a labor organization under &#167; 402(i), that it exists \"for the purpose, in whole or part, of<i>dealing with employers.</i>\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 402(i)(emphasis added). Because Morales does not challenge FUPO's status as a labor union with respect to this requirement, we consider the argument waived. <i>See, e.g., Am. Cyanamid Co. v. Capuano,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">381</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></span>, 18 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Morales does not contend that remand is warranted so that the district court can reconsider the severity of the sentence in light of<i>Booker.</i> Thus, we do not consider this possibility.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
