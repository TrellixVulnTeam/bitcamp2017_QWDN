These are two appeals from\n\njudgments of conviction for possession of more than five kilograms\n\nof cocaine, with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §\n\n841(a)(1).     Each of the defendants, Basilio Inirio-Castro and\n\nIsidro Rosario, has raised a challenge to the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence. Inirio-Castro also asserts a separate issue based on the\n\nalleged inconsistency between the jury's general verdict and its\n\nanswer to a special interrogatory that Inirio-Castro claims was\n\nimproperly submitted to the jury.\n\n       Despite an able and spirited defense in both cases, we affirm.\n\n       Both appellants and the government agree, as do we, that our\n\ntask in evaluating sufficiency is to consider whether all the\n\nevidence, circumstantial as well as direct, taken in the light most\n\nfavorable to the prosecution, including reasonable inferences,\n\nenables a rational jury to reach a judgment of guilty beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.       See, e.g., United States v. Ortiz de Jesus, 230\n\nF.3d 1,5 (1st Cir. 2000).       Appellants, however, argue that this is\n\na case where the evidence for and against guilt is so nearly equal\n\nthat   a   reasonable    jury   could    not   have   found   guilt   beyond   a\n\nreasonable doubt.       See United States v. Morillo, 158 F.3d 18, 22\n\n(lst    Cir. 1998).     But, as Morillo and the case law on which it\n\nrelies make clear, all the evidence – that pointing to innocence as\n\nwell as that pointing to guilt – must be reviewed in the light most\n\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\ffavorable to the prosecution.          Id.    With this in mind, we set forth\n\nthe essentials.\n\n     On September 5, 2000, appellant Inirio-Castro returned from\n\nvisiting family members in the Dominican Republic and, with                       his\n\ncousin, appellant Rosario, left at a little after 6 p.m. from\n\nFajardo on the east coast of Puerto Rico ostensibly to go fishing.\n\nTheir destination was the area of Las Paulinas beach, between\n\nLuquillo and Fajardo.\n\n     At about 9:30 p.m., a U.S. Customs officer using aircraft\n\ninfrared radar spotted a small boat powered by twin outboards,\n\nshowing no running lights but bearing two individuals, moving\n\nslowly some 50 to 75 feet from shore.             He maintained radar contact\n\nwith this vessel as it moved further away from the beach.                    Turning\n\nhis attention     to   the    beach,    he    observed      people    moving    large\n\npackages away from the shoreline, and others moving packages toward\n\na van.    Later in the evening, a police officer on land discovered\n\neight    bales   of   cocaine     on   the    beach   and,   the     next   morning,\n\nseventeen more bales were found near the truck.\n\n     Meanwhile, a unit of the Puerto Rico Rapid Action United\n\nForces pursued the target vessel and boarded it at about 11 p.m.,\n\nabout one half to three quarters of a mile off shore.                          It was\n\nanchored   but   showed      no   anchor     light;   the    two   occupants     were\n\napparently fishing.       It had started raining intensely.                 There was\n\nsome fishing gear aboard (two rods, a reel, ten to fifteen bait\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\ffish) but no weights, nets, fishing flyers, or gloves . . . and no\n\ncaught fish.    The boat bore a Virgin Islands registration and both\n\nappellants had fishing licenses. Inirio-Castro said that he earned\n\nfrom $1000 to $3000 a month from fishing.        The boat carried no cell\n\nphones,   radios,    GPS   (Global     Positioning     System)   or   other\n\nnavigational aid, and no firearms.         Appellant Rosario was found to\n\nhave sand in his pocket and the two appellants were carrying cash\n\ntotaling almost $1000.\n\n     A gaff, used to land fish and retrieve other objects from the\n\nwater, was found to have a white powdery substance on its tip.\n\nThis was subjected to a field test and reacted positively to\n\ncocaine. Fourteen of the twenty-five bales were found to have been\n\npunctured or pierced by a sharp object.              White plastic burlap\n\nstrips found on the gaff, under a seat, around wiring, tubing,\n\nhoses, battery line, and engine were given laboratory testing,\n\nwhich revealed similar physical and chemical characteristics to\n\nthose on five bales found on the beach.\n\n     Appellants seek to characterize their case as one of equal or\n\nnear equal weight to that of the prosecution, making the following\n\narguments.     They point out that they were not at the beach, that\n\nothers could have delivered the packages, and that they were being\n\nprosecuted for \"mere presence.\"            They point out that the only\n\nspecial equipment on the boat was consistent with fishing, the boat\n\ncarried a registration, both appellants had valid fishing licenses,\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fno equipment associated with drug smuggling was on board, and that,\n\nunlike an outlaw boat, the vessel was proceeding very slowly.\n\nFinally, field tests were known sometimes to register \"false\n\npositive\" results       and   the     white   plastic    strips   had    not   been\n\nsubjected   to   the    further     lab   analysis      that   could    positively\n\nidentify them as coming from the bales on the beach.\n\n     Without in any way denigrating the efforts and competence of\n\nappellants’ counsel, we think that there are just too many bridges\n\nto cross and too many assumptions to be made for these observations\n\nand arguments to rise to the point where we could say that a\n\nrational jury must have a reasonable doubt.                    The temporal and\n\nspatial proximity of the boat and the beach operations may not be\n\nconclusive, but it is significant, particularly in the absence of\n\nevidence suggesting any other source of delivery of the bales.                    A\n\nreasonable jury might question the presence, so close to shore, in\n\na reef-surrounded area, of a boat bent solely on fishing.                 It might\n\nalso find significance in the fact that sand was found in one\n\nappellant’s pocket.\n\n     A   rational      jury   might    also    question    the    likelihood     of\n\nappellants fishing for several hours and, without any visible\n\nsuccess, continuing despite heavy rain.            And it might further give\n\nconsiderable weight to the positive reaction of the field test on\n\nthe gaff and the chemical and physical comparability of the strips\n\nfound on the vessel to materials from the bales, even though\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\ftesting for a positive identification of source was not undertaken.\n\nFinally, it might also infer that the holes punched in the bales\n\nhad, in the absence of other explanation, been made by the gaff.\n\n     We therefore conclude that the judgments of conviction are\n\nsupported by sufficient evidence.\n\n     What remains is Inirio-Castro's argument that the verdicts are\n\nvulnerable based on the special interrogatory answered by the jury.\n\nThe facts relevant to this issue are the following.              During the\n\ntrial, the jury was read a stipulation signed by all parties that\n\nthe twenty-five bales seized on the beach, after chemical analysis,\n\nhad been found to contain more than 150 kilograms of cocaine.            When\n\nthe case was given to the jurors, they received a verdict form.\n\nThere   were   two   items   requiring    jury   action.   The   first    was\n\nregistration of its finding of guilt or acquittal:\n\n     WE, THE JURY, FIND DEFENDANT: [NAME]\n\n     ___________________        as charged in COUNT ONE of the\n                                Indictment\n        GUILTY/NOT GUILTY\n\nCount One of the Indictment described the offense as possession\n\nwith intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine.\n\n     Secondly, at the bottom of the form was this instruction and\n\nquestion:\n\n     If you find the defendant guilty, then proceed to answer the\nfollowing question:\n\n\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f           Do you find that the amount of cocaine involved in\n     the offense charged was in an amount of 150 kilograms or\n     more?\n           ____________         ___________\n\n                 YES                           NO\n\n     The jury returned the form with \"Guilty\" in the blank of the\n\nfirst item and \"No\" as the answer to the question.                     Appellant\n\nInirio-Castro contends that submitting this question and permitting\n\nthis answer amounts to a constructive amendment of the indictment,\n\nviolating both the Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the\n\nSixth Amendment requirement of a jury verdict.             He further argues\n\nthat the response invalidates the verdict of guilty, signifying a\n\nrejection of all the evidence of the twenty-five bales on the\n\nbeach.\n\n     The argument relies on our decision in United States v. Spock,\n\n416 F.2d 165 (1st Cir. 1969), where we underscored the general\n\ninappropriateness       of   submitting    special    questions   in    criminal\n\ncases.    In that case, ten special questions were put to the jury,\n\nresulting \"in a progression of questions each of which seems to\n\nrequire   an   answer    unfavorable      to   the   defendant,   [leading]    a\n\nreluctant juror . . . to vote for a conviction which, in the large,\n\nhe would have resisted.\"        Id. at 180-82.\n\n     We recognized, however, the existence of an exception for\n\ncases in which \"the determination of a particular fact will be\n\ncrucial to sentencing,\" id. at 182 n.41. We have subsequently made\n\nit   clear     that    there   is   no    \"mechanical     per     se   rule   of\n\n                                     -8-\n\funconstitutionality . . . for all special questions in criminal\n\ncases,\" Heald v. Mullaney, 505 F.2d 1241, 1245 (1st Cir. 1974).   We\n\nhave also reaffirmed our recognition that special questions may be\n\npermissible in federal criminal proceedings, \"usually in connection\n\nwith sentence,\" id.    We have noted the existence of this genre of\n\ncases specifically in connection with firearms prosecutions where\n\nthe severity of sentence would be related to the specific firearm\n\npossessed by a defendant.     See United States v. Ellis, 168 F.3d\n\n558, 562 n.2 (1st Cir. 1999); United States v. Melvin, 27 F.3d 710,\n\n716 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n     We think the special question asked in this case was of this\n\nnature.   The court apparently was seeking what it thought was\n\nnecessary guidance under Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466\n\n(2000), to determine a fact crucial to sentencing.    Moreover, we\n\ncan see no reasonable possibility of prejudice.       The jury had\n\nregistered its finding that defendants had possessed over five\n\nkilograms of cocaine with the intent to distribute.    This finding\n\nobviously stemmed from the evidence of the twenty-five bales and\n\nthe stipulation that they contained more than 150 kilograms.      Now\n\nthe jury was being given an opportunity to limit responsibility to\n\na lower amount.   This choice clearly benefitted appellants, since\n\nthe court, while recognizing that it could impose sentence based on\n\na much higher quantity of cocaine, respected and followed the\n\njury's finding in his sentencing calculations.\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f     Appellants, however, urge that the answer to the special\n\nquestion implied a rejection of all the evidence of bales found on\n\nthe beach, leaving only the evidence of a trace of cocaine on the\n\ngaff - enough only to justify conviction for simple possession.\n\nThis leap of reasoning assumes that the jury was not only reneging\n\non its verdict of guilt for possession of more than five kilograms\n\nwith intent to distribute, but also was ignoring the comparability\n\nof materials found in the boat and on the beach, the punctured\n\nbales, the actions of appellants in the boat, and the absence of\n\nany other explanation for the trace of cocaine found on the gaff.\n\nWe do not think that this collection of assumptions falls within\n\nthe range of the rational.\n\n     We therefore conclude that the special question and the jury’s\n\nanswer did not invalidate the verdict.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -10-\n\f",

They point out that they were not at the beach, that\n\nothers could have delivered the packages, and that they were being\n\nprosecuted for \"mere presence.\"            They point out that the only\n\nspecial equipment on the boat was consistent with fishing, the boat\n\ncarried a registration, both appellants had valid fishing licenses,\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fno equipment associated with drug smuggling was on board, and that,\n\nunlike an outlaw boat, the vessel was proceeding very slowly.\n\nFinally, field tests were known sometimes to register \"false\n\npositive\" results       and   the     white   plastic    strips   had    not   been\n\nsubjected   to   the    further     lab   analysis      that   could    positively\n\nidentify them as coming from the bales on the beach.\n\n     Without in any way denigrating the efforts and competence of\n\nappellants’ counsel, we think that there are just too many bridges\n\nto cross and too many assumptions to be made for these observations\n\nand arguments to rise to the point where we could say that a\n\nrational jury must have a reasonable doubt.                    The temporal and\n\nspatial proximity of the boat and the beach operations may not be\n\nconclusive, but it is significant, particularly in the absence of\n\nevidence suggesting any other source of delivery of the bales.                    A\n\nreasonable jury might question the presence, so close to shore, in\n\na reef-surrounded area, of a boat bent solely on fishing.                 It might\n\nalso find significance in the fact that sand was found in one\n\nappellant’s pocket.\n\n     A   rational      jury   might    also    question    the    likelihood     of\n\nappellants fishing for several hours and, without any visible\n\nsuccess, continuing despite heavy rain.            And it might further give\n\nconsiderable weight to the positive reaction of the field test on\n\nthe gaff and the chemical and physical comparability of the strips\n\nfound on the vessel to materials from the bales, even though\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\ftesting for a positive identification of source was not undertaken.\n\nFinally, it might also infer that the holes punched in the bales\n\nhad, in the absence of other explanation, been made by the gaff.\n\n     We therefore conclude that the judgments of conviction are\n\nsupported by sufficient evidence.\n\n     What remains is Inirio-Castro's argument that the verdicts are\n\nvulnerable based on the special interrogatory answered by the jury.\n\nThe facts relevant to this issue are the following.              During the\n\ntrial, the jury was read a stipulation signed by all parties that\n\nthe twenty-five bales seized on the beach, after chemical analysis,\n\nhad been found to contain more than 150 kilograms of cocaine.            When\n\nthe case was given to the jurors, they received a verdict form.\n\nThere   were   two   items   requiring    jury   action.   The   first    was\n\nregistration of its finding of guilt or acquittal:\n\n     WE, THE JURY, FIND DEFENDANT: [NAME]\n\n     ___________________        as charged in COUNT ONE of the\n                                Indictment\n        GUILTY/NOT GUILTY\n\nCount One of the Indictment described the offense as possession\n\nwith intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine.\n\n     Secondly, at the bottom of the form was this instruction and\n\nquestion:\n\n     If you find the defendant guilty, then proceed to answer the\nfollowing question:\n\n\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f           Do you find that the amount of cocaine involved in\n     the offense charged was in an amount of 150 kilograms or\n     more?\n           ____________         ___________\n\n                 YES                           NO\n\n     The jury returned the form with \"Guilty\" in the blank of the\n\nfirst item and \"No\" as the answer to the question.                     Appellant\n\nInirio-Castro contends that submitting this question and permitting\n\nthis answer amounts to a constructive amendment of the indictment,\n\nviolating both the Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the\n\nSixth Amendment requirement of a jury verdict.             He further argues\n\nthat the response invalidates the verdict of guilty, signifying a\n\nrejection of all the evidence of the twenty-five bales on the\n\nbeach.\n\n     The argument relies on our decision in United States v.

Moreover, we\n\ncan see no reasonable possibility of prejudice.       The jury had\n\nregistered its finding that defendants had possessed over five\n\nkilograms of cocaine with the intent to distribute.    This finding\n\nobviously stemmed from the evidence of the twenty-five bales and\n\nthe stipulation that they contained more than 150 kilograms.      Now\n\nthe jury was being given an opportunity to limit responsibility to\n\na lower amount.   This choice clearly benefitted appellants, since\n\nthe court, while recognizing that it could impose sentence based on\n\na much higher quantity of cocaine, respected and followed the\n\njury's finding in his sentencing calculations.\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f     Appellants, however, urge that the answer to the special\n\nquestion implied a rejection of all the evidence of bales found on\n\nthe beach, leaving only the evidence of a trace of cocaine on the\n\ngaff - enough only to justify conviction for simple possession.\n\nThis leap of reasoning assumes that the jury was not only reneging\n\non its verdict of guilt for possession of more than five kilograms\n\nwith intent to distribute, but also was ignoring the comparability\n\nof materials found in the boat and on the beach, the punctured\n\nbales, the actions of appellants in the boat, and the absence of\n\nany other explanation for the trace of cocaine found on the gaff.\n\nWe do not think that this collection of assumptions falls within\n\nthe range of the rational.\n\n     We therefore conclude that the special question and the jury’s\n\nanswer did not invalidate the verdict.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -10-\n\f</pre>",
