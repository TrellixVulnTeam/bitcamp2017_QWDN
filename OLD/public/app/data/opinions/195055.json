This  is  the\n                                          \n\nepilogue to a  charade designed by a foreign  lender to avoid\n\npayment of Puerto  Rico income taxes  on Puerto Rico  income.\n\nThe script was a  farce; the players did not  even follow it.\n\nIts reviewers give it a bad notice.\n\nI.        Background\n                    \n\n          Plaintiff, Redondo Construction  Corp., is a Puerto\n\nRico  corporation  engaged  in  the  construction   business.\n\nDefendant, Banco Exterior de  Espa a, is a Spanish  bank with\n\nan office in Miami, Florida.   In 1985 defendant sent one  of\n\nits vice  presidents to Puerto  Rico, where he  solicited the\n\nopportunity to  finance a  part  of plaintiff's  construction\n\nwork.  Negotiations ensued; plaintiff disclosed its financial\n\nstatements, and those of its two stockholders, as  proof that\n\nit  was  economically   sound.    At  some   point  defendant\n\nconditioned its performance  on plaintiff's  acceptance of  a\n\nstructure it concocted to prevent its incurring tax liability\n\nunder 13 L.P.R.A.   3231 that imposes on foreign corporations\n\na 29% tax on income earned in Puerto Rico, including interest\n\non  loans  to  a  Puerto   Rico  corporation.    13  P.R.L.A.\n\n  3119(a)(1).  Plaintiff agreed.\n\n          The  parties accordingly  created  a third  entity,\n\n\"Redondo-USA,\" a Delaware  corporation that  would appear  as\n\nnominal borrower  on defendant's  credit line.   Counsel  for\n\ndefendant drew up the incorporation papers and mailed them to\n\n                             -2-\n\nplaintiff in  Puerto Rico.   Plaintiff's  president was  made\n\npresident  of Redondo-USA.   The  agreement  provided that  a\n\ncredit line  would  be extended  to Redondo-USA;  Redondo-USA\n\nwould  then   forward  the   funds  to   plaintiff  for   its\n\nconstruction projects;  plaintiff would  assign the  proceeds\n\nfrom its construction contracts  to Redondo-USA, which  would\n\nthen use these  funds to repay defendant.   Plaintiff and its\n\ntwo  stockholders  appeared  as  guarantors  and   \"principal\n\nobligors\" on the credit line agreement.\n\n          After  the execution of  the agreement, the parties\n\nlargely disregarded  the separate  existence of  Redondo-USA.\n\nAlthough   the  agreement  provided  that  loan  payments  to\n\ndefendant were to  be made by Redondo-USA,  in fact plaintiff\n\nmade those  payments throughout,  by its  own checks,  naming\n\ndefendant as the payee.  There was no mention of Redondo-USA.\n\nPlaintiff   and   defendant   both  certified   annually   to\n\ndefendant's   auditors  defendant's   running  account   with\n\nplaintiff.  Again, no mention of  Redondo-USA.  The tri-party\n\nagreement, made  much of  in defendant's brief,  was a  joke,\n\neven to the participants.\n\n          In  1990 the  Puerto  Rico  Department of  Treasury\n\ndetermined  that  plaintiff  had made  interest  payments  to\n\ndefendant of $591,332.   Because 13 P.R.L.A.    3144 requires\n\nwithholding  of the  29%  tax  from  interest  payments,  the\n\nTreasury assessed  back taxes  of $171,486,  and penalty  and\n\n                             -3-\n\ninterest  charges of $40,277,  on plaintiff.   Plaintiff then\n\nbrought this action  seeking compensation from defendant  for\n\nthese payments.  The district court found defendant liable to\n\nplaintiff  for the  back taxes,  but not  for the  penalty or\n\ninterest.  Defendant appeals.  We affirm.\n\nII.       Discussion\n                    \n\n          A.   Jurisdiction\n                           \n\n          The district court determined  that it had specific\n\njurisdiction over defendant  on the grounds that  plaintiff's\n\nclaim  arose directly out  of defendant's acts  in the forum,\n\nregardless  of whether  defendant's  contacts with  the forum\n\nwere sufficient to establish jurisdiction for all purposes.\n\n          We agree  that there  is ample  basis for  specific\n\njurisdiction.  Defendant's vice  president traveled to Puerto\n\nRico to  solicit plaintiff's business.   As a result  of that\n\nsolicitation, plaintiff  and defendant negotiated  the credit\n\nagreement.  Plaintiff signed  the credit agreement and was  a\n\nparty to it, although it was not the nominal borrower.  Under\n\nthe  agreement,  plaintiff  incurred ongoing  obligations  to\n\ndefendant, not only to guarantee  the loan but also to assign\n\nits  construction proceeds to  Redondo-USA.  Thus  even under\n\nits  own characterization  of  the  agreement, defendant  had\n\nsufficient involvement in  Puerto Rico to have  foreseen that\n\nit  might  be   sued  there  on  disputes  arising  from  the\n\nagreement.   International Shoe  v. Washington, 326  U.S. 310\n                                              \n\n                             -4-\n\n(1945); United Elec.  Workers v. 163 Pleasant St.  Corp., 960\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 1080 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n          Defendant has not asserted any particular burden in\n\nappearing in Puerto Rico rather than Florida, and Puerto Rico\n\nhas a distinct interest in having disputes under its tax code\n\nadjudicated in Puerto Rico courts.  Even if the agreement had\n\nbeen  strictly performed,  it would  not  be unreasonable  or\n\nunfair, in these  circumstances, to subject defendant  to the\n\nauthority of  a Puerto Rico  tribunal.  Burger King  Corp. v.\n                                                          \n\nRudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 476-77 (1985).\n         \n\n          Moreover,  we  need  not  blind  ourselves  to  the\n\nreality behind  the agreement's  transparent  fictions.   The\n\nagreement  is no  different in  substance from  one in  which\n\nplaintiff is the borrower.  \"If International Shoe stands for\n                                                  \n\nanything,  . . . it  is that a  truly interstate business may\n\nnot shield  itself  from suit  by a  careful but  formalistic\n\nstructuring of  its business dealings.\"  Vencedor Mfg. Co. v.\n                                                          \n\nGougler Indus., 557 F.2d 886, 891 (1st Cir. 1977).1\n              \n\n          B.   Forum clause\n                           \n\n          In this situation defendant  points to a  provision\n\nin the agreement as an  escape hatch.  The agreement provided\n\nthat the \"Borrower  and the Guarantors each  hereby expressly\n                                                             \n\n                    \n\n1.  For  the same reasons,  we find that  defendant's actions\ncome within the  language of Puerto Rico's  Long-arm statute,\n32  P.R.L.A.   App.  III   Rule  4.7(a).     See   Industrial\n                                                             \nSiderurgica,  Inc.  v.  Thyssen  Steel  Caribbean, Inc.,  114\n                                                       \nD.P.R. 548, 14 Official Translation 708, 721-22 n.5 (1983).\n\n                             -5-\n\nsubmits to the  jurisdiction of all Federal and  State courts\n\nlocated  in  the   State  of  Florida.\"     (Emphasis  ours).\n\nDefendant  argues that this  clause prohibits  plaintiff from\n\nsuing in the District  of Puerto Rico.  This  is a confusion.\n\nAffirmatively conferring Florida jurisdiction by consent does\n\nnot  negatively exclude any  other proper jurisdiction.   See\n                                                             \n\nHunt Wesson Foods, Inc. v.  Supreme Oil Co., 817 F.2d  75, 77\n                                           \n\n(9th  Cir. 1987).    There  is  a  total  difference  between\n\n\"expressly\"  and \"exclusively.\"    Even  if  there  could  be\n\nthought   to  be  ambiguity,   its  resolution  must   be  in\n\nplaintiff's favor.  Under Florida law (by which the agreement\n\nprovides  it is to  be construed), as  elsewhere, ambiguities\n\nare  construed against  the drafter.   Capital  City Bank  v.\n                                                         \n\nHilson, 59 Fla.  215, 219, 51 So. 853, 855 (1910).  Thus even\n      \n\nif the agreement  could have some effect upon this collateral\n\naction, that effect, jurisdictionally, would be nil.\n\n          C.   Liability\n                        \n\n          The  court  held  that  defendant  was  liable   to\n\nplaintiff on either of two theories: (1) because plaintiff is\n\nentitled to repayment for having paid the debt of another, 31\n\nP.R.L.A.    3162;  or  (2)  because  defendant  was  unjustly\n\nenriched at plaintiff's expense.   Each theory depends on the\n\nassumption  that   defendant   was   the   party   ultimately\n\nresponsible for payment of the tax, which defendant disputes.\n\n          We note first that nothing before us indicates that\n\n                             -6-\n\nthe assessment  of  taxes on  plaintiff  by the  Puerto  Rico\n\nTreasury   was  erroneous.    Defendant  makes  much  of  the\n\ncontractual  language  stating   that  only  Redondo-USA,   a\n\nDelaware corporation, shall make payments, but that  language\n\nis irrelevant on this point;  the agreement does not bind the\n\nTreasury.  Defendant  does not dispute  that payments on  the\n\nloan  were in  fact made by  plaintiff by check  drawn on its\n\nPuerto  Rico  account  and   that  defendant  accepted  those\n\npayments.  This is sufficient to  bring the payments squarely\n\nwithin   3231 as  income derived \"from sources  within Puerto\n\nRico.\"   13  P.R.L.A. 3231(a)(1)(A).   Cf.  Caribe Crown  Cap\n                                                             \n\nCorp. v. Secretary  of the Treasury,  108 D.P.R. 857,  863-64\n                                   \n\n(1979)   (translation)  (source   of   income  derived   from\n\nintangible property  is place  where intangible  property \"is\n\nactually and effectively used\");  Inter-American Orange Crush\n                                                             \n\nCo. v.

Moreover,  the Treasury  could\n\nproperly  disregard  the  corporate  status  of  the  nominal\n\nborrower,  Redondo-USA, as merely  an instrument \"to  evade a\n\nclear legislative purpose.\"  South  P.R. Sugar Corp. v. Sugar\n                                                             \n\nBoard, 88 P.R.R. 42, 56 (1963).\n     \n\n          Just as the transactional structure is insufficient\n\nto shift the  tax burden away from defendant  by operation of\n\n                             -7-\n\nlaw, it  is also insufficient  to show an intention  to shift\n\nthat burden by agreement.   Had the parties explicitly agreed\n\nthat plaintiff would be responsible for the taxes that  would\n\notherwise fall  on defendant,  no further  analysis would  be\n\nnecessary.  The parties expressed no such intention,  as they\n\ncould  easily  have  done; in  fact,  the  agreement contains\n\nsections  entitled   \"Payment  of  Taxes\"  and   \"Payment  of\n\nIndebtedness, Taxes\"  in which no such terms appear.  Rather,\n\nthe parties set up a two-step transaction that appears geared\n\nmore to  evade the imposition  of the tax altogether  than to\n\nreallocate  that burden between the parties.  While obviously\n\ndefendant hoped  to avoid  the tax, there  is nothing  in the\n\nlanguage of  the agreement  evidencing a  mutual intent  that\n\nplaintiff  take  on  the  tax  burden itself.    We  find  no\n\ncontractual defense to the action.2\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                    \n\n2.  Defendant briefly  argues that once  plaintiff had  paid,\ndefendant should not  have to make  compensation, even if  it\nwould initially  have been responsible.   The cases  cited by\ndefendant, however, are all from jurisdictions outside Puerto\nRico and are unpersuasive in light of Puerto Rico's statutory\nprovision  allowing recovery  by  one who  pays  the debt  of\nanother.  31 P.R.L.A.   3162.\n\n                             -8-\n",

Affirmatively conferring Florida jurisdiction by consent does not negatively exclude any other proper jurisdiction.  See Hunt Wesson Foods, Inc. v. Supreme Oil Co., 817 F.2d 75, 77 (9th Cir.1987).  There is a total difference between \"expressly\" and \"exclusively.\"   Even if there could be thought to be ambiguity, its resolution must be in plaintiff's favor.

Each theory depends on the assumption that defendant was the party ultimately responsible for payment of the tax, which defendant disputes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note first that nothing before us indicates that the assessment of taxes on plaintiff by the Puerto Rico Treasury was erroneous.  Defendant makes much of the contractual language stating that only Redondo-USA, a Delaware corporation, shall make payments, but that language is irrelevant on this point;  the agreement does not bind the Treasury.  Defendant does not dispute that payments on the loan were in fact made by plaintiff by check drawn on its Puerto Rico account and that defendant accepted those payments.  This is sufficient to bring the payments squarely within Sec. 3231 as income derived \"from sources within Puerto Rico.\"  13 P.R.L.A. 3231(a)(1)(A).  Cf. Caribe Crown Cap Corp. v. Secretary of the Treasury, 108 D.P.R. 857, 863-64 (1979) (translation) (source of income derived from intangible property is place where intangible property \"is actually and effectively used\");  Inter-American Orange Crush Co. v. Secretary of the Treasury, 81 P.R.R. 286, 297-298 (1959) (source of royalty income \"depends on the situs where the personal property from which the income is derived is really and actually used\").  Moreover, the Treasury could properly disregard the corporate status of the nominal borrower, Redondo-USA, as merely an instrument \"to evade a clear legislative purpose.\"   South P.R. Sugar Corp. v. Sugar Board, 88 P.R.R. 42, 56 (1963).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Just as the transactional structure is insufficient to shift the tax burden away from defendant by operation of law, it is also insufficient to show an intention to shift that burden by agreement.  Had the parties explicitly agreed that plaintiff would be responsible for the taxes that would otherwise fall on defendant, no further analysis would be necessary.  The parties expressed no such intention, as they could easily have done;  in fact, the agreement contains sections entitled \"Payment of Taxes\" and \"Payment of Indebtedness, Taxes\" in which no such terms appear.  Rather, the parties set up a two-step transaction that appears geared more to evade the imposition of the tax altogether than to reallocate that burden between the parties.  While obviously defendant hoped to avoid the tax, there is nothing in the language of the agreement evidencing a mutual intent that plaintiff take on the tax burden itself.  We find no contractual defense to the action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> For the same reasons, we find that defendant's actions come within the language of Puerto Rico's Long-arm statute, 32 P.R.L.A.App. III Rule 4.7(a).

The script was a farce;  the players did not even follow it.  Its reviewers give it a bad notice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff, Redondo Construction Corp., is a Puerto Rico corporation engaged in the construction business.  Defendant, Banco Exterior de Espana, is a Spanish bank with an office in Miami, Florida.  In 1985 defendant sent one of its vice presidents to Puerto Rico, where he solicited the opportunity to finance a part of plaintiff's construction work.  Negotiations ensued;  plaintiff disclosed its financial statements, and those of its two stockholders, as proof that it was economically sound.  At some point defendant conditioned its performance on plaintiff's acceptance of a structure it concocted to prevent its incurring tax liability under 13 L.P.R.A. Sec. 3231 that imposes on foreign corporations a 29% tax on income earned in Puerto Rico, including interest on loans to a Puerto Rico corporation.  13 P.R.L.A. Sec. 3119(a)(1).  Plaintiff agreed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties accordingly created a third entity, \"Redondo-USA,\" a Delaware corporation that would appear as nominal borrower on defendant's credit line.  Counsel for defendant drew up the incorporation papers and mailed them to plaintiff in Puerto Rico.  Plaintiff's president was made president of Redondo-USA.  The agreement provided that a credit line would be extended to Redondo-USA;  Redondo-USA would then forward the funds to plaintiff for its construction projects;  plaintiff would assign the proceeds from its construction contracts to Redondo-USA, which would then use these funds to repay defendant.  Plaintiff and its two stockholders appeared as guarantors and \"principal obligors\" on the credit line agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the execution of the agreement, the parties largely disregarded the separate existence of Redondo-USA.  Although the agreement provided that loan payments to defendant were to be made by Redondo-USA, in fact plaintiff made those payments throughout, by its own checks, naming defendant as the payee.  There was no mention of Redondo-USA.  Plaintiff and defendant both certified annually to defendant's auditors defendant's running account with plaintiff.  Again, no mention of Redondo-USA.  The tri-party agreement, made much of in defendant's brief, was a joke, even to the participants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1990 the Puerto Rico Department of Treasury determined that plaintiff had made interest payments to defendant of $591,332.  Because 13 P.R.L.A. Sec. 3144 requires withholding of the 29% tax from interest payments, the Treasury assessed back taxes of $171,486, and penalty and interest charges of $40,277, on plaintiff.  Plaintiff then brought this action seeking compensation from defendant for these payments.  The district court found defendant liable to plaintiff for the back taxes, but not for the penalty or interest.  Defendant appeals.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Discussion</p>\n    <p>A. Jurisdiction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court determined that it had specific jurisdiction over defendant on the grounds that plaintiff's claim arose directly out of defendant's acts in the forum, regardless of whether defendant's contacts with the forum were sufficient to establish jurisdiction for all purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree that there is ample basis for specific jurisdiction.  Defendant's vice president traveled to Puerto Rico to solicit plaintiff's business.  As a result of that solicitation, plaintiff and defendant negotiated the credit agreement.  Plaintiff signed the credit agreement and was a party to it, although it was not the nominal borrower.  Under the agreement, plaintiff incurred ongoing obligations to defendant, not only to guarantee the loan but also to assign its construction proceeds to Redondo-USA.  Thus even under its own characterization of the agreement, defendant had sufficient involvement in Puerto Rico to have foreseen that it might be sued there on disputes arising from the agreement.
