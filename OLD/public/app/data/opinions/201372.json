Barbadoro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                        Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n                   Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                     and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Gordon A. Rehnborg, Jr., with whom Mary Ann Dempsey and Wiggin\n& Nourie, P.A., were on brief, for Appellant Daniel Littlefield.\n     Leonard W. Langer, with whom Marshall J. Tinkle and Tompkins,\nClough, Hirshon & Langer, P.A., were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n                         December 8, 2004\n\f             LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.    This case requires us to decide\n\nwhether a provision of a yacht insurance policy excluding coverage\n\nfor \"any loss, damage or liability willfully, intentionally or\n\ncriminally caused or incurred by an insured person\" is ambiguous as\n\napplied to an insured who was convicted of criminally negligent\n\nhomicide after his involvement in a fatal boat collision, and, if\n\nnot ambiguous, whether its enforcement would render coverage under\n\nthe policy illusory.      Answering both questions in the negative, we\n\naffirm the district court's order granting summary judgment to\n\nDefendant-Appellee Acadia Insurance Company (\"Acadia\") and denying\n\nsummary judgment     to   Plaintiff-Appellant   Daniel   Littlefield   in\n\nLittlefield's action seeking a declaratory judgment of coverage\n\nunder the yacht insurance policy.\n\n                                     I.\n\n             On August 11, 2002, Daniel Littlefield was operating a\n\nthirty-six-foot motorized pleasure boat insured under an Acadia\n\n\"yacht policy\" on Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire when it\n\ncollided with another boat, killing one of that boat's passengers,\n\nJohn H. Hartman.      In January 2003 Littlefield was indicted by a\n\ngrand jury on two counts of criminally negligent homicide under\n\nsections 630:3(I) and (II) of the New Hampshire Criminal Code.1\n\n\n     1\n         Section 630:3 provides, in pertinent part:\n\n             I. A person is guilty of a class B felony when\n             he causes the death of another negligently.\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fAlso in January 2003, the victim's widow and executrix of his\n\nestate, Defendant-Appellant Karen K. Hartman (\"Hartman\"), brought\n\na wrongful death action against Littlefield in New Hampshire state\n\ncourt alleging negligence. On April 3, 2003, Littlefield, in turn,\n\nsought a declaratory judgment in New Hampshire state court that\n\nAcadia was obligated under the terms of the yacht policy to provide\n\nhim with insurance coverage, including a defense in Hartman's\n\nwrongful death suit.2\n\n\n          II. A person is guilty of a class A felony\n          when in consequence of being under the\n          influence   of   intoxicating  liquor   or   a\n          controlled   drug   or   any  combination   of\n          intoxicating liquor and controlled drug while\n          operating a propelled vehicle, as defined in\n          RSA 637:9, III or a boat as defined in RSA\n          270:48, II, he causes the death of another.\n\nN.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ยง 630:3 (2004).     All sections of the New\nHampshire Criminal Code to which we refer were in effect at the\ntime of the collision on August 11, 2002.\n     2\n      Littlefield was permitted in state court to name Hartman,\nwith her consent, as a defendant in his declaratory judgment action\nbecause she had standing under New Hampshire state law to contest\nAcadia's denial of coverage to Littlefield under the insurance\npolicy. Since Hartman and Littlefield are both citizens of New\nHampshire, Hartman's inclusion as a defendant would defeat complete\ndiversity.   See Strawbridge v. Curtiss, 7 U.S. (3 Cranch) 267\n(1806); see also Am. Fiber & Finishing, Inc. v. Tyco Healthcare\nGroup, LP, 362 F.3d 136, 139 (1st Cir. 2004) (discussing\n\"abecedarian rule that there must be complete diversity among the\nparties to sustain diversity jurisdiction\"). As Hartman's interest\nin this case and the relief she seeks are identical to\nLittlefield's, she should have been re-aligned as a plaintiff, and\nwe re-align her. See City of Indianapolis v. Chase Nat'l Bank, 314\nU.S. 63, 75 n.4 (1941) (\"the parties must be aligned according to\ntheir 'attitude towards the actual and substantial controversy'\"\nfor purposes of determining diversity of citizenship) (quoting\nSutton v. English, 246 U.S. 199, 204 (1918)); see also Saylab v.\n\n                               -3-\n\f           Acadia asserted that it had no such obligation under two\n\nseparate provisions of the yacht policy, the first contained in\n\nSection B of the policy, which governs \"Protection and Indemnity\n\nInsurance,\" and the second contained in Section G, which sets forth\n\n\"General   Conditions\"   applicable    to   the   entire   policy.   The\n\nprovision in Section B excludes from coverage \"any loss, damage or\n\nliability willfully, intentionally or criminally caused or incurred\n\nby an insured person.\"       The provision in Section G excludes\n\ncoverage for \"any loss, damage or expense arising out of or during\n\nany illegal activity on your part or on the part of anyone using\n\nthe insured's property with your permission.\"3         On May 2, 2003,\n\nAcadia removed the case to federal district court, citing both\n\ndiversity and possible admiralty jurisdiction.\n\n           On June 20, 2003, a Belknap County Superior Court jury\n\nfound Littlefield not guilty on the indictment's first count of\n\n\"negligently causing the death of another in the consequence of\n\nbeing under the influence of intoxicating liquor while operating a\n\nboat on Lake Winnepesaukee,\" a Class A felony, but guilty of the\n\n\nHarford Mut. Ins. Co., 271 F. Supp. 2d 112, 116 (D.D.C. 2003)\n(realigning insured as plaintiff in tort plaintiff's declaratory\njudgment action against insurance company).\n     3\n      The policy defines an \"insured person\" as \"the person named\non the Declaration Page and any family member who resides with you.\nIt shall also include any person or organization whom you permit to\noperate the yacht without charge and for private pleasure only.\"\nIt is undisputed that Littlefield was operating the yacht with the\npermission of his father, the policyholder, and is an insured\nperson under the policy.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fsecond count of \"negligently caus[ing] the death of another while\n\noperating a boat . . . and fail[ing] to keep a proper lookout,\" a\n\nClass B felony.        Citing principles of issue preclusion, Acadia\n\nmoved    for    summary   judgment   in    this   case   on   the    ground    that\n\nLittlefield's criminal conviction rendered his potential liability\n\nin Hartman's wrongful death action \"criminally caused or incurred,\"\n\nas well as \"arising out of or during . . . illegal activity\" within\n\nthe meaning of the policy exclusions. Littlefield brought a cross-\n\nmotion for summary judgment, arguing that the language of the\n\npolicy exclusion in Section B of the policy is ambiguous and should\n\nbe construed to provide coverage despite his criminal conviction.\n\nLittlefield asserted that a reasonable insured would interpret\n\n\"willfully,       intentionally   or      criminally     caused     or   incurred\"\n\nliability or losses to refer only to those caused or incurred\n\nthrough the commission of willful or intentional crimes.                       Under\n\nLittlefield's       interpretation,       liability    incurred      through    the\n\ncommission of unintentional crimes, including criminally negligent\n\nhomicide, would not be excluded from coverage.4               Littlefield also\n\n\n     4\n      It is undisputed that Littlefield did not intend either to\ncollide with the other boat or to kill the victim as a result of a\ncollision. Under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ยง 626:2(d) (2004), \"A person\nacts negligently with respect to a material element of an offense\"\nfor the purposes of the criminal code, including section 630:3,\n\n               when he fails to become aware of a substantial\n               and unjustifiable risk that the material\n               element exists or will result from his\n               conduct. The risk must be of such a nature\n               and degree that his failure to become aware of\n\n                                       -5-\n\fargued that enforcement of either the exclusion provision in\n\nSection B or Section G of the policy would leave so few claims\n\nactually covered as to render coverage under the policy illusory in\n\ncontravention of public policy favoring compensation of innocent\n\nvictims unintentionally harmed by an insured.\n\n          On May 11, 2004, the federal district court granted\n\nAcadia's motion for summary judgment and denied Littlefield's\n\ncross-motion    for   summary   judgment,      finding   that    coverage   was\n\nexcluded under the provision in Section B regarding \"any loss,\n\ndamage or liability willfully, intentionally or criminally caused\n\nor incurred by an insured person.\"           The court stated:\n\n          It is well understood that negligence can be\n          criminal when it results in death. The policy\n          does not limit the exclusion to intentional\n          crimes and the mere fact that the phrase is\n          grouped with exclusions for willfully and\n          intentionally caused acts would not cause a\n          reasonably   informed   insured  to   read   a\n          limitation into the exclusion that it does not\n          contain.\n\nLittlefield v. Acadia Ins. Co., No. 03-CV-220, 2004 U.S. Dist.\n\nLEXIS 8410, at *8-9 (D.N.H. May 11, 2004).         The court also rejected\n\nLittlefield's     argument      that     the    exclusion       provision   is\n\n\n          it constitutes a gross deviation from the\n          conduct that a reasonable person would observe\n          in the situation.\n\nUnder New Hampshire state law, criminal negligence is measured\nagainst an objective standard. State v. Ebinger, 603 A.2d 924, 925\n(N.H. 1992) (\"Whether [a] defendant failed to become aware of a\n'substantial and unjustifiable risk' is determined by an objective\ntest, not by reference to the defendant's subjective perception.\").\n\n                                       -6-\n\funenforceable as contrary to public policy.               The court did not\n\nreach       the     applicability   or   enforceability   of   the   exclusion\n\nprovision in Section G.5            Littlefield and Hartman appealed, and\n\ntheir cases were consolidated for purposes of appeal.6\n\n                                         II.\n\n                  We review a district court's grant of summary judgment de\n\nnovo.       Rodriguez v. Smithkline Beecham, 224 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).      Summary judgment is appropriate only where \"the pleadings,\n\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\n\ntogether with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled\n\nto a judgment as a matter of law.\"             Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).   \"Cross\n\nmotions simply require us to determine whether either of the\n\nparties deserves judgment as a matter of law on facts that are not\n\ndisputed.\"          Barnes v. Fleet Nat'l Bank, N.A., 370 F.3d 164, 170\n\n(1st Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\nThe parties contest only the interpretation of the yacht insurance\n\n     5\n      We also do not reach the question of whether the provision in\nSection G is unambiguous and enforceable as applied to these facts.\n        6\n      Littlefield also appealed from his criminal conviction on\nsufficiency of evidence as well as other grounds. Oral argument\nwas heard in the New Hampshire Supreme Court on October 13, 2004,\nand a decision is pending. In the event that the New Hampshire\nSupreme Court grants a judgment of acquittal to Littlefield or\nremands for a new trial, the premise of the district court's ruling\nand ours will have changed. Littlefield could then move for relief\nin the district court from the district court's judgment on the\nground that \"a prior judgment upon which it is based has been\nreversed or otherwise vacated.\" See Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(5).\n\n                                         -7-\n\fpolicy's exclusion provisions.         Whether there is any ambiguity in\n\nthe exclusion provisions is a question of law for the court to\n\ndetermine.     See Nieves v. Intercontinental Life Ins. Co. of P.R.,\n\n964 F.2d 60, 63 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\nA.            Choice of Law\n\n              We first identify the applicable law.           The Acadia yacht\n\npolicy contains a choice-of-law provision: \"This Policy shall be\n\ngoverned by and construed under the general Maritime Law of the\n\nUnited States of America regardless of the venue or jurisdiction of\n\nthe   court    or    arbitration.\"     The    parties   do    not   dispute     the\n\napplicability of the choice-of-law provision, and federal maritime\n\nlaw is clearly applicable to the yacht policy at issue,                   Acadia\n\nIns. Co. v. McNeil, 116 F.3d 599, 603 (1st Cir. 1997) .               Even under\n\nfederal   maritime        law,    however,     \"[a]     maritime     contract's\n\ninterpretation may so implicate local interests as to beckon\n\ninterpretation by state law.\"          Norfolk S. Ry. Co. v. Kirby, ____\n\nU.S. ____, ____ (2004).\n\n              To    determine    whether    application      of   state   law   is\n\nappropriate under federal maritime law, we must first inquire\n\nwhether any federal statute governs the interpretation of the\n\npolicy provision at issue in this case, and we find none.                       See\n\nWilburn Boat Co. v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co., 348 U.S. 310, 314, 321\n\n(1955) (\"Since Congress has not taken over regulation of marine\n\ninsurance contracts . . . there is no possible question here of\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fconflict between a state law and any federal statute.\").            Next, we\n\nask whether there is a specific, federal, judicially-created rule\n\ngoverning the interpretation of this policy, and we also find none.\n\nSee, e.g., Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Flagship Marine Servs.,\n\nInc., 190 F.3d 26, 30 (2d Cir. 1999) (finding \"no specific federal\n\nrule governing construction of maritime insurance contracts\").\n\nInstead, we note that general principles of contract law are used\n\nto interpret marine insurance policies.           See id.; see, e.g.,\n\nIngersoll Milling Mach. Co. v. M/V Bodena, 829 F.2d 293, 306 (2d\n\nCir. 1987) (noting that the principle that an ambiguous insurance\n\ncontract \"will generally be construed against the insurer who\n\ndrafted it in order to promote coverage for losses to which the\n\npolicy relates . . . applies to all types of insurance policies[,]\n\nincluding maritime policies.\") (citations omitted); Kalmbach, Inc.\n\nv. Ins. Co. of the State of Penn., 529 F.2d 552, 555 (9th Cir.\n\n1976) (\"[W]e can see no significant difference between construction\n\nof an ordinary insurance policy and one with marine insurance\n\novertones.    In general, each is to be construed against the\n\ninsurance company.\").       Having discerned that there is no federal\n\nstatute or federal rule governing the interpretation of the policy\n\nin this case, we lastly must inquire whether we should fashion such\n\na rule, and conclude we should not.      See Wilburn Boat Co., 348 U.S.\n\nat 314 (deciding, as Congress has, to leave the regulation of\n\nmarine   insurance   with   the   states);   McNeil,   116   F.3d    at   603\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\f(favoring application of state law over \"the fashioning of new\n\nfederal law\" where no conflict between state law and any applicable\n\nfederal   statute   is    presented)   (internal   quotation   marks   and\n\ncitation omitted).       Therefore, having found no federal statute or\n\njudicially-created rule governing the interpretation of maritime\n\ninsurance policies, and concluding that we should not fashion any\n\nsuch rule, we look to the state law of New Hampshire, as do the\n\nparties in this case, to govern our interpretation.7\n\n\n     7\n      The district court did not explicitly address either the\nparties' choice of federal maritime law as expressed in the\ninsurance policy provision or its reasons for applying New\nHampshire law as a consequence of the application of federal\nmaritime law principles.     It simply stated: \"I interpret the\n[yacht] policy using New Hampshire law,\" Littlefield, 2004 U.S.\nDist. LEXIS 8410, at *5-6, and cited Acadia Ins. Co. v. McNeil, 116\nF.3d 599 (1st Cir. 1997). Nor do the parties specify their reasons\nfor applying New Hampshire law. Although the record in this case\ndoes not permit an exhaustive analysis of the contacts of the\nparties or the insurance policy with the state of New Hampshire, we\nare satisfied that the contacts that do appear in the record --\nnamely, the New Hampshire citizenship of the insured (Littlefield),\nand the storage and operation of the subject matter of the\ninsurance contract (the yacht) in that state -- adequately support\nthe application of New Hampshire law in this case.       See, e.g.,\nAqua-Marine Constructors, Inc. v. Banks, 110 F.3d 663, 674 (9th\nCir. 1997) (citing factors listed in Restatement (Second) of\nConflict of Laws ยง 188 (1971), including \"the location of the\nsubject matter of the contract\" and \"the domicil, residence,\nnationality, place of incorporation and place of business of the\nparties\" as establishing sufficient contacts under federal maritime\nchoice-of-law rules for applicability of a state's law in marine\ninsurance contracts cases). But see Albany Ins. Co. v. Anh Thi\nKieu, 927 F.2d 882, 891 (5th Cir. 1991) (applicable state law under\nfederal maritime choice-of-law rule includes law of state in which\nmarine insurance policy was formed or law of state in which policy\nwas issued and delivered).      See also Restatement (Second) of\nConflict of Laws ยง 9 (1971) (\"Limitations on Choice of Law\": \"A\ncourt may not apply the local law of its own state to determine a\nparticular issue unless such application of this law would be\n\n                                   -10-\n\fB.         New Hampshire Rules of Construction\n\n           In the absence of any New Hampshire court decision\n\naddressing the precise policy exclusion at issue, we resolve the\n\nquestion before us in light of New Hampshire state law governing\n\nthe interpretation of insurance policies in general.          See Coakley\n\nv. Me. Bonding and Cas. Co., 618 A.2d 777, 781 (N.H. 1992).          Under\n\nthat body of law, \"the fundamental inquiry\" in interpreting an\n\ninsurance policy, as with other written contracts, \"centers on\n\ndetermining   the   intent   of   the   parties   at   the   time   of   the\n\nagreement.\"   Trombly v. Blue Cross/Blue Shield of N.H.-Vt., 423\n\nA.2d 980, 984 (N.H. 1980).        To this end, a court examining the\n\nlanguage of an insurance policy must \"take the plain and ordinary\n\nmeaning of the policy's words in context[] and . . . construe the\n\nterms of the policy as would a reasonable person in the position of\n\nthe insured based on more than a casual reading of the policy as a\n\nwhole.\"   Brouillard v. Prudential Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co., 693 A.2d\n\n63, 66 (N.H. 1997) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\nBecause insurance policies must be interpreted to protect the\n\nreasonable expectations of the policyholder, see A.J. Cameron Sod\n\nFarms, Inc. v. Cont'l Ins. Co., 700 A.2d 290, 292 (N.H. 1997), a\n\ncourt must inquire \"whether the ordinary layman in the position of\n\nthe insured could reasonably be expected to understand that certain\n\n\n\nreasonable in the light of the relationship of the state and of\nother states to the person, thing or occurrence involved.\").\n\n                                  -11-\n\fexclusions qualif[y] the policy's grant of coverage.\"    N.H. Ins.\n\nCo. v. Schofield, 406 A.2d 715, 717 (N.H. 1979) (internal quotation\n\nmarks and citations omitted).\n\n          If, under this standard, an insurance policy provision is\n\nsusceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation, \"and an\n\ninterpretation provides coverage, the policy contains an ambiguity\n\nand will be construed against the insurer.\"     Fed. Bake Shop v.\n\nFarmington Cas. Co., 736 A.2d 459, 460 (N.H. 1999); see also\n\nContoocook Valley Sch. Dist. v. Graphic Arts Mut. Ins. Co., 788\n\nA.2d 259, 261 (N.H. 2001) (\"We will deem a policy term ambiguous as\n\nto coverage when the parties may reasonably differ about their\n\ninterpretation and will construe the ambiguity in favor of the\n\ninsured.\"). Interpretation of an ambiguity to favor the insured as\n\nagainst the insurer \"is particularly applicable when ambiguities\n\nare found in an exclusionary clause.\"     Id.

At the same time, while ambiguous\n\nterms may be construed to favor an insured, we may not find a term\n\nambiguous merely because it eliminates coverage.     See Funai v.\n\nMetro. Prop. & Cas.

The American Heritage Dictionary of the English\n\nLanguage (4th ed. 2000) defines the adjective \"criminal\" as,\n\nsimply, \"[o]f, involving, or having the nature of crime.\" \"Crime,\"\n\nin turn, is defined as \"[a]n act committed or omitted in violation\n\nof a law forbidding or commanding it and for which punishment is\n\nimposed upon conviction.\" Id.

See, e.g., Allstate Ins. Co. v. Barron, 848 A.2d\n1165 (Conn. 2004) (criminal acts exclusion inapplicable where\ninsured could not be convicted based on lack of capacity to form\nculpable intent); Swift v. Fitchburg Mut. Ins.

Here, Littlefield was\nconvicted of a crime; he thus \"come[s] directly within the purview\"\nof the exclusion for \"criminally caused\" loss or liability.\nJuniel, 931 P.2d at 514.\n\n                                     -14-\n\f             Nevertheless, in an effort to find ambiguity in the\n\npolicy exclusion for \"willfully, intentionally or criminally caused\n\nor incurred\" loss or liability, Littlefield first invokes the\n\ndoctrine of ejusdem generis, which provides that \"where general\n\nwords follow an enumeration of persons or things, by words of a\n\nparticular and specific meaning, such general words are not to be\n\nconstrued in their widest extent, but are to be held as applying\n\nonly to persons or things of the same kind or class as those\n\nspecifically mentioned.\"      State v. Beckert, 741 A.2d 63, 65 (N.H.\n\n1999) (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 517 (6th ed. 1990)).          In\n\nLittlefield's view,     the first two words in the list in the Section\n\nB exclusion provision, \"willfully\" and \"intentionally,\" are \"words\n\nof a particular and specific meaning\" because they require a higher\n\nlevel   of    intent   than   negligence.   By   contrast,   the   word\n\n\"criminally,\" which encompasses a broad spectrum of culpable states\n\nof mind, is a \"general\" word that should not \"be construed in [its]\n\nwidest extent, but [should] be held as applying only to\" crimes \"of\n\nthe same kind or class\" as the acts encompassed by the preceding\n\ntwo words.    That is to say, \"criminally\" should be read as limited\n\nby the same high threshold of intent as the words \"willfully\" and\n\n\"intentionally.\"\n\n             We do not agree. \"Criminally,\" when read after the words\n\n\"willfully\" and \"intentionally,\" is neither more general nor more\n\nspecific than the two preceding words; it is merely different.\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\fEach of the three terms is \"general\" in the sense that each\n\nencompasses a broad range of specific acts.            There is some overlap\n\nin   the   conduct    excluded   by   these   general    terms.      However,\n\n\"criminally\" encompasses both unintentional and intentional crimes,\n\nwhile \"willfully\" and \"intentionally\" encompass both non-criminal\n\nand criminal acts.      Only \"criminally\" includes unintentional acts\n\ncommitted with a criminally culpable state of mind.                  Criminal\n\nnegligence is such an act under the New Hampshire Criminal Code.\n\nN.H.   Rev.   Stat.   Ann.   ยง   626:2(d)    (2004).     To   read   the   word\n\n\"criminally\" to incorporate the limitations Littlefield seeks would\n\nrender the word extraneous.           Loss or liability caused through\n\n\"intentional\" crimes is already excluded as \"intentionally\" caused\n\nloss or liability.       We decline to ignore the plain meaning of\n\n\"criminally\" in favor of a reading that would render the word\n\nsuperfluous. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts ยง 203(a) (1981)\n\n(\"an interpretation which gives a reasonable, lawful, and effective\n\nmeaning to all the terms is preferred to an interpretation which\n\nleaves a part unreasonable, unlawful, or of no effect\"); 2 Lee R.\n\nRuss, Couch on Insurance ยง 22:43 (3d ed. 1995) (\"Since it must be\n\nassumed that each word contained in an insurance policy is intended\n\nto serve a purpose, every term will be given effect if that can be\n\ndone by any reasonable construction.\").         More importantly, where a\n\npolicy provision is unambiguous and the contracting parties' intent\n\nis thus clearly manifested in the plain language of that provision,\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fresort to canons of interpretation is simply unwarranted. See Eric\n\nMills Holmes & Mark S. Rhodes, Holmes's Appleman on Insurance ยง 5.1\n\n(2d ed. 1996) (courts may not \"resort to . . . aids of construction\n\nwhere contract language is unambiguous.          The intent of the parties\n\nand meaning of the contract are to be determined by the language\n\nalone.\").\n\n              As a last-ditch effort, Littlefield urges us to adopt the\n\nreasoning and result of Young v. Brown, 658 So.2d 750 (La. Ct. App.\n\n1995),   in    which   a   Louisiana    appellate     court    interpreting   a\n\nhomeowner's liability insurance policy held that criminally caused\n\ninjury must be at least intentional or willful in order to be\n\nexcluded from      coverage.     In    that   case,   the     insurance   policy\n\npurported to exclude coverage for injury \"which may reasonably be\n\nexpected to result from the intentional or criminal acts of an\n\ninsured person or which is in fact intended by an insured person.\"\n\nId. at 752.      The Young court stated that,\n\n              [n]estled between exclusions for injuries\n              resulting from intentional acts and for\n              intentionally inflicted injuries, a reasonable\n              purchaser could have understood the basis of\n              the exclusion to be intentional misconduct or\n              intentional criminal acts, thereby allowing\n              coverage for damages resulting from criminal\n              negligence.\n\nId. at 754.\n\n              To the extent that the Young decision rests on a finding\n\nof ambiguity in the challenged exclusion provision, we believe that\n\n\n\n                                       -17-\n\fcase was wrongly decided.10        We are not alone.        A multitude of\n\njurisdictions have reached a contrary result, finding as a matter\n\nof law that similar provisions unambiguously exclude loss or\n\nliability caused through the commission of a crime without regard\n\nto an insured's intent to act, much less to cause harm.            See, e.g.,\n\nHooper v. Allstate Ins.

Ins. Co. v. White, 65 P.3d 449, 452 & n.1 (Ariz.

As we discuss below, we do not find enforcement of the\nexclusion provision in this case to be contrary to New Hampshire\npublic policy even if enforced according to its clear and\nunambiguous terms.\n\n                                    -18-\n\fphrase 'criminal acts' does not distinguish between intentional and\n\nunintentional crimes.

See Am. Policyholder's Ins.\n\nCo. v.   Baker,   409    A.2d   1346,   1349    (N.H.   1979)   (\"[L]iability\n\ninsurance is intended not only to indemnify the insured, but also\n\nto protect members of the public who may be injured through\n\nnegligence.\").    In support of this claim, Littlefield points to a\n\ndifferent New Hampshire criminal statute that renders \"careless and\n\nnegligent\" operation of a power boat a misdemeanor and, therefore,\n\na crime under the New Hampshire Criminal Code, regardless of the\n\nlevel of harm caused, as distinct from the statute under which he\n\nwas convicted, which reaches only criminally negligent conduct that\n\nresults in death.       Compare N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ยง 270:29-a (2004)\n\n(\"Careless and Negligent Operation of Boats\") with N.H. Rev. Stat.\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\fAnn. ยง 630:3 (2004) (\"Negligent Homicide\").     Littlefield asserts\n\nthat any negligent operation of a power boat could result in a\n\ncriminal conviction under section 270:29-a, thereby triggering the\n\nexclusion provision for property damage or minor injuries -- that,\n\nis, for harms generally considered to be caused through civil\n\nnegligence only.   Exclusion of such a wide range of negligently\n\ncaused loss or liability, he argues, would leave so few claims\n\nactually covered as to defeat the purpose of purchasing liability\n\ninsurance in the first place.\n\n          We need not concern ourselves with factual scenarios not\n\npresented by this case. Littlefield was convicted of the felony of\n\ncriminally negligent homicide, not the misdemeanor of carelessly\n\noperating a power boat.   Nevertheless, even if his conviction had\n\nbeen for the lesser offense, proof of the requisite culpable mental\n\nstate would still be required for a conviction under New Hampshire\n\nstate law.   Section 625:9(II) of the New Hampshire Criminal Code\n\nmakes the Code's definitions of culpable mental states applicable\n\nto misdemeanors codified outside the Criminal Code, such as section\n\n270:29-a (unless the non-criminal statute provides otherwise, which\n\nsection 270:29-a does not).     Criminally negligent operation of a\n\npower boat, therefore, like all criminal negligence under New\n\nHampshire state law, requires at least a \"fail[ure] to become aware\n\nof a substantial and unjustifiable risk\" that \"constitutes a gross\n\n\n\n\n                                -20-\n\fdeviation from the conduct that a reasonable person would observe\n\nin the situation.\"       N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ยง 626:2(d) (2004).\n\n            Moreover, as Acadia points out, even in the absence of a\n\nstatutory requirement of intent, under New Hampshire state law, \"a\n\nperson cannot be convicted of a crime,\" including a misdemeanor,\n\n\"without proof that the unlawful act was accompanied by a culpable\n\nmental state.\"     State v. Goodwin, 671 A.2d 554, 555 (N.H. 1996).\n\nNegligent   operation     of    a   watercraft,    in    the    absence   of   the\n\nrequisite culpable mental state, could not be a crime and would not\n\ntrigger the exclusion provision in Section B of the policy. Hence,\n\ncriminal    negligence       differs   from   civil     negligence    under    New\n\nHampshire law in important ways,11 and the yacht policy provides\n\nmeaningful coverage for loss or liability incurred through the\n\nlatter    (as   well   as,    Acadia   notes,     through      \"non-operational\"\n\nnegligence such as negligent maintenance).12\n\n\n     11\n      Under New Hampshire law, civil liability for tortious\nnegligence may be established where an actor is \"in breach of an\nexisting duty and create[s] a foreseeable risk of harm to someone\nto whom that duty is owed.\" Thibeault v. Campbell, 622 A.2d 212,\n214 (N.H. 1993) (citation omitted).\n     12\n      We note that numerous state courts have also held that\nenforcement of similar insurance policy provisions excluding\ncoverage for criminally caused loss or liability does not violate\nthe public policy of those states. See, e.g., Hooper, 571 So.2d at\n1003 (\"No public policy considerations dictate that an insurer must\nindemnify a third party for the criminal acts of an insured.\");\nWhite, 65 P.3d at 454 & n.3 (enforcement of exclusion provision\ndoes not violate public policy; collecting cases); Juniel, 931 P.2d\nat 516 (\"we perceive no violation of public policy because . . .\nthe criminal act exclusion . . . merely excludes a reasonable\nsubset of injuries -- those resulting from criminal acts\").\n\n                                       -21-\n\f            As the district court noted, \"[w]hile reasonable people\n\ncan disagree about whether an insurance company should be permitted\n\nto offer insurance that fails to cover liability that results from\n\ncriminally      negligent    conduct,    the   arguments   supporting\n\nLittlefield's position are not so strong as to render the clause\n\nunenforceable.\"       Littlefield, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8410, at *9\n\nn.2.    We agree.13\n\n                                  IV\n\n             Because we find that the insurance policy provision\n\nexcluding coverage for \"any loss, damage or liability willfully,\n\nintentionally or criminally caused or incurred by an insured\n\nperson\" is not ambiguous as applied to the undisputed facts of this\n\ncase, and that its enforcement against Littlefield does not render\n\ncoverage under the policy illusory, the district court's order\n\ngranting summary judgment to Acadia and denying summary judgment to\n\nLittlefield is\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n       13\n      We express no opinion about whether similar exclusions for\ncriminal, yet unintentional, conduct in other, non-marine policies\nfor liability insurance, such as in automobile insurance policies,\nwould be violative of public policy or would render such coverage\nillusory.\n\n                                  -22-\n\f",

Answering both questions in the negative, we affirm the district court's order granting summary judgment to Defendant-Appellee Acadia Insurance Company (\"Acadia\") and denying summary judgment to Plaintiff-Appellant Daniel Littlefield in Littlefield's action seeking a declaratory judgment of coverage under the yacht insurance policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 11, 2002, Daniel Littlefield was operating a thirty-six-foot motorized pleasure boat insured under an Acadia \"yacht policy\" on Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire when it collided with another boat, killing one of that boat's passengers, John H. Hartman. In January 2003 Littlefield was indicted by a grand jury on two counts of criminally negligent homicide under sections 630:3(I) and (II) of the New Hampshire Criminal Code.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Also in January 2003, the victim's widow and executrix of his estate, Defendant-Appellant Karen K. Hartman (\"Hartman\"), brought a wrongful death action against Littlefield in New Hampshire state court alleging negligence. On April 3, 2003, Littlefield, in turn, sought a declaratory judgment in New Hampshire state court that Acadia was obligated under the terms of the yacht policy to provide him with insurance coverage, including a defense in Hartman's wrongful death suit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Acadia asserted that it had no such obligation under two separate provisions of the yacht policy, the first contained in Section B of the policy, which governs \"Protection and Indemnity Insurance,\" and the second contained in Section G, which sets forth \"General Conditions\" applicable to the entire policy. The provision in Section B excludes from coverage \"any loss, damage or liability willfully, intentionally or criminally caused or incurred by an insured person.\" The provision in Section G excludes coverage for \"any loss, damage or expense arising out of or during any illegal activity on your part or on the part of anyone using the insured's property with your permission.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> On May 2, 2003, Acadia removed the case to federal district court, citing both diversity and possible admiralty jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 20, 2003, a Belknap County Superior Court jury found Littlefield not guilty on the indictment's first count of \"negligently causing the death of another in the consequence of being under the influence of intoxicating liquor while operating a boat on Lake Winnepesaukee,\" a Class A felony, but guilty of the second count of \"negligently caus[ing] the death of another while operating a boat ... and fail[ing] to keep a proper lookout,\" a Class B felony. Citing principles of issue preclusion, Acadia moved for summary judgment in this case on the ground that Littlefield's criminal conviction rendered his potential liability in Hartman's wrongful death action \"criminally caused or incurred,\" as well as \"arising out of or during ... illegal activity\" within the meaning of the policy exclusions. Littlefield brought a cross-motion for summary judgment, arguing that the language of the policy exclusion in Section B of the policy is ambiguous and should be construed to provide coverage despite his criminal conviction. Littlefield asserted that a reasonable insured would interpret \"willfully, intentionally or criminally caused or incurred\" liability or losses to refer only to those caused or incurred through the commission of willful or intentional crimes. Under Littlefield's interpretation, liability incurred through the commission of unintentional crimes, including criminally negligent homicide, would not be excluded from coverage.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Littlefield also argued that enforcement of either the exclusion provision in Section B or Section G of the policy would leave so few claims actually covered as to render coverage under the policy illusory in contravention of public policy favoring compensation of innocent victims unintentionally harmed by an insured.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 11, 2004, the federal district court granted Acadia's motion for summary judgment and denied Littlefield's cross-motion for summary judgment, finding that coverage was excluded under the provision in Section B regarding \"any loss, damage or liability willfully, intentionally or criminally caused or incurred by an insured person.\" The court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well understood that negligence can be criminal when it results in death.

Summary judgment is appropriate only where \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). \"Cross motions simply require us to determine whether either of the parties deserves judgment as a matter of law on facts that are not disputed.\" <i>Barnes v. Fleet Nat'l Bank, N.A.,</i> 370 F.3d 164, 170 (1st Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The parties contest only the interpretation of the yacht insurance policy's exclusion provisions. Whether there is any ambiguity in the exclusion provisions is a question of law for the court to determine. <i>See Nieves v. Intercontinental Life Ins.

The Acadia yacht policy contains a choice-of-law provision: \"This Policy shall be governed by and construed under the general Maritime Law of the United States of America regardless of the venue or jurisdiction of the court or arbitration.\" The parties do not dispute the applicability of the choice-of-law provision, and federal maritime law is clearly applicable to the yacht policy at issue, <i>Acadia Ins. Co. v. McNeil,</i> 116 F.3d 599, 603 (1st Cir.1997). Even under federal maritime law, however, \"[a] maritime contract's interpretation may so implicate local interests as to beckon interpretation by state law.\" <i>Norfolk S. Ry. Co. v.

Fireman's Fund Ins. Co.,</i> 348 U.S. 310, 314, 321, 75 S.Ct. 368, 99 L.Ed. 337 (1955) (\"Since Congress has not taken over regulation of marine insurance contracts... there is no possible question here of conflict between a state law and any federal statute.\"). Next, we ask whether there is a specific, federal, judicially-created rule governing the interpretation of this policy, and we also find none. <i>See, e.g., Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Flagship Marine Servs., Inc.,</i> 190 F.3d 26, 30 (2d Cir.1999) (finding \"no specific federal rule governing construction of maritime insurance contracts\"). Instead, we note that general principles of contract law are used to interpret marine insurance policies. <i>See id.; see, e.g., Ingersoll Milling Mach. Co. v. M/V Bodena,</i> 829 F.2d 293, 306 (2d Cir.1987) (noting that the principle that an ambiguous insurance contract \"will generally be construed against the insurer who drafted it in order to promote coverage for losses to which the policy relates ... applies to all types of insurance policies[,] including maritime policies.\") (citations omitted); <i>Kalmbach, Inc. v. Ins. Co. of the State of Penn.,</i> 529 F.2d 552, 555 (9th Cir.1976) (\"[W]e can see no significant difference between construction of an ordinary insurance policy and one with marine insurance overtones. In general, each is to be construed against the insurance company.\"). Having discerned that there is no federal statute or federal rule governing the interpretation of the policy in this case, we lastly must inquire whether we should fashion such a rule, and conclude we should not. <i>See Wilburn Boat Co.,</i> 348 U.S. at 314, 75 S.Ct. 368 (deciding, as Congress has, to leave the regulation of marine insurance with the states); <i>McNeil,</i> 116 F.3d at 603 (favoring application of state law over \"the fashioning of new federal law\" where no conflict between state law and any applicable federal statute is presented) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Therefore, having found no federal statute or judicially-created rule governing the interpretation of maritime insurance policies, and concluding that we should not fashion any such rule, we look to the state law of New Hampshire, as do the parties in this case, to govern our interpretation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.

Me. Bonding and Cas. Co.,</i> 136 N.H. 402, 618 A.2d 777, 781 (1992). Under that body of law, \"the fundamental inquiry\" in interpreting an insurance policy, as with other written contracts, \"centers on determining the intent of the parties at the time of the agreement.\" <i>Trombly v. Blue Cross/Blue Shield of N.H.-Vt.,</i> 120 N.H. 764, 423 A.2d 980, 984 (1980). To this end, a court examining the language of an insurance policy must \"take the plain and ordinary meaning of the policy's words in context[ ] and ... construe the terms of the policy as would a reasonable person in the position of the insured based on more than a casual reading of the policy as a whole.\" <i>Brouillard v. Prudential Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co.,</i> 141 N.H. 710, 693 A.2d 63, 66 (1997) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Because insurance policies must be interpreted to protect the reasonable expectations of the policyholder, <i>see A.J. Cameron Sod Farms, Inc. v. Cont'l Ins. Co.,</i> 142 N.H. 275, 700 A.2d 290, 292 (1997), a court must inquire \"whether the ordinary layman in the position of the insured could reasonably be expected to understand that certain exclusions qualif[y] the policy's grant of coverage.\" <i>N.H.

Interpretation of an ambiguity to favor the insured as against the insurer \"is particularly applicable when ambiguities are found in an exclusionary clause.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). At the same time, while ambiguous terms may be construed to favor an insured, we may not find a term ambiguous merely because it eliminates coverage. <i>See Funai v. Metro. Prop. &amp; Cas.

Application to the Yacht Policy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Acadia yacht policy itself contains no definition of the word \"criminally.\" Dictionary definitions, while not controlling, \"are of some value ... to the extent they inform us of the common understanding of terms.\" <i>Hudson v. Farm Family Mut. Ins.

The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (4th ed.2000) defines the adjective \"criminal\" as, simply, \"[o]f, involving, or having the nature of crime.\" \"Crime,\" in turn, is defined as \"[a]n act committed or omitted in violation of a law forbidding or commanding it and for which punishment is imposed upon conviction.\" <i>Id.</i> Whether or not a particular offense is a \"crime\" in common parlance thus depends on the existence of some legal duty or prohibition, not the mental state of the actor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The exclusion provision thus unambiguously excludes coverage for liability incurred by an insured person, such as Littlefield, through the commission of a crime for which he has been convicted &#8212; here, a felony &#8212; without regard to the requisite mental state of the crime.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> A reasonable layperson \"in the position of the insured based on more than a casual reading of the policy as a whole,\" <i>Brouillard,</i> 693 A.2d at 66 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), would understand that proposition. Because we can conceive of no other reasonable interpretation of the provision at issue, we find no ambiguity in the policy provision that warrants its being \"construed against the insurer.\" <i>Fed. Bake Shop,</i> 736 A.2d at 460.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, in an effort to find ambiguity in the policy exclusion for \"willfully, intentionally or criminally caused or incurred\" loss or liability, Littlefield first invokes the doctrine of <i>ejusdem generis,</i> which provides that \"where general words follow an enumeration of persons or things, by words of a particular and specific meaning, such general words are not to be construed in their widest extent, but are to be held as applying only to persons or things of the same kind or class as those specifically mentioned.\" <i>State v. Beckert,</i> 144 N.H. 315, 741 A.2d 63, 65 (1999) (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 517 (6th ed.1990)). In Littlefield's view, the first two words in the list in the Section B exclusion provision, \"willfully\" and \"intentionally,\" are \"words of a particular and specific meaning\" because they require a higher level of intent than negligence. By contrast, the word \"criminally,\" which encompasses a broad spectrum of culpable states of mind, is a \"general\" word that should not \"be construed in [its] widest extent, but [should] be held as applying only to\" crimes \"of the same kind or class\" as the acts encompassed by the preceding two words. That is to say, \"criminally\" should be read as limited by the same high threshold of intent as the words \"willfully\" and \"intentionally.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not agree. \"Criminally,\" when read after the words \"willfully\" and \"intentionally,\" is neither more general nor more specific than the two preceding words; it is merely different. Each of the three terms is \"general\" in the sense that each encompasses a broad range of specific acts. There is some overlap in the conduct excluded by these general terms. However, \"criminally\" encompasses both unintentional and intentional crimes, while \"willfully\" and \"intentionally\" encompass both non-criminal and criminal acts. Only \"criminally\" includes <i>un</i> intentional acts committed with a criminally culpable state of mind. Criminal negligence is such an act under the New Hampshire Criminal Code. N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 626:2(d) (2004). To read the word \"criminally\" to incorporate the limitations Littlefield seeks would render the word extraneous. Loss or liability caused through \"intentional\" crimes is already excluded as \"intentionally\" caused loss or liability. We decline to ignore the plain meaning of \"criminally\" in favor of a reading that would render the word superfluous. <i>See</i> Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#167; 203(a) (1981) (\"an interpretation which gives a reasonable, lawful, and effective meaning to all the terms is preferred to an interpretation which leaves a part unreasonable, unlawful, or of no effect\"); 2 Lee R. Russ, Couch on Insurance &#167; 22:43 (3d ed. 1995) (\"Since it must be assumed that each word contained in an insurance policy is intended to serve a purpose, every term will be given effect if that can be done by any reasonable construction.\"). More importantly, where a policy provision is unambiguous and the contracting parties' intent is thus clearly manifested in the plain language of that provision, resort to canons of interpretation is simply unwarranted. <i>See</i> Eric Mills Holmes &amp; Mark S. Rhodes, Holmes's Appleman on Insurance &#167; 5.1 (2d ed.1996) (courts may not \"resort to ... aids of construction where contract language is unambiguous. The intent of the parties and meaning of the contract are to be determined by the language alone.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a last-ditch effort, Littlefield urges us to adopt the reasoning and result of <i>Young v. Brown,</i> 658 So.2d 750 (La.Ct.App.1995), in which a Louisiana appellate court interpreting a homeowner's liability insurance policy held that criminally caused injury must be at least intentional or willful in order to be excluded from coverage. In that case, the insurance policy purported to exclude coverage for injury \"which may reasonably be expected to result from the intentional or criminal acts of an insured person or which is in fact intended by an insured person.\" <i>Id.</i> at 752. The <i>Young</i> court stated that,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[n]estled between exclusions for injuries resulting from <i>intentional</i> acts and for <i>intentionally</i> inflicted injuries, a reasonable purchaser could have understood the basis of the exclusion to be intentional misconduct or intentional criminal acts, thereby allowing coverage for damages resulting from criminal negligence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 754.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that the <i>Young</i> decision rests on a finding of ambiguity in the challenged exclusion provision, we believe that case was wrongly decided.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> We are not alone. A multitude of jurisdictions have reached a contrary result, finding as a matter of law that similar provisions unambiguously exclude loss or liability caused through the commission of a crime without regard to an insured's intent to act, much less to cause harm. <i>See, e.g., Hooper v. Allstate Ins. Co.,</i> 571 So.2d 1001, 1002-03 (Ala.1990) (finding criminal acts exclusion clause unambiguous and noting that \"[a] number of other jurisdictions have held that the same exclusion was unambiguous and excluded coverage for injuries resulting from criminal acts by the insured, regardless of whether the insured intended to commit the act or to cause the harm\"); <i>Am. Family Mut. Ins. Co. v. White,</i> 204 Ariz. 500, 65 P.3d 449, 452 &amp; n. 1 (Ariz.Ct.App.2003) (finding that \"the phrase `any criminal law' plainly includes all criminal laws, not just those in which `intent' is an essential element,\" and collecting fifteen cases from thirteen jurisdictions similarly finding on the facts before them, as contrasted with the sole outlier, <i>Young v.

Peasley,</i> 131 Wash.2d 420, 932 P.2d 1244, 1249 (1997) (\"As used in [policy] exclusionary clause, the phrase `criminal acts' does not distinguish between intentional and unintentional crimes. The language is unambiguous, and it clearly encompasses [the] criminal act of reckless endangerment.\"). Accordingly, we reject Littlefield's attempts to inject ambiguity into the yacht policy's provision excluding coverage for \"any loss, damage or liability willfully, intentionally or criminally caused or incurred by an insured person.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Littlefield asserts that enforcement of the exclusion provision in Section B, even if the provision is unambiguous, would render Acadia's promised coverage \"illusory\" in violation of New Hampshire public policy favoring compensation of innocent victims of an insured's unintentional acts. <i>See Am. Policyholder's Ins. Co. v. Baker,</i> 119 N.H. 958, 409 A.2d 1346, 1349 (1979) (\"[L]iability insurance is intended not only to indemnify the insured, but also to protect members of the public who may be injured through negligence.\"). In support of this claim, Littlefield points to a different New Hampshire criminal statute that renders \"careless and negligent\" operation of a power boat a misdemeanor and, therefore, a crime under the New Hampshire Criminal Code, regardless of the level of harm caused, as distinct from the statute under which he was convicted, which reaches only criminally negligent conduct that results in death. <i>Compare</i> N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 270:29-a (2004) (\"Careless and Negligent Operation of Boats\") <i>with</i> N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 630:3 (2004) (\"Negligent Homicide\"). Littlefield asserts that <i>any</i> negligent operation of a power boat could result in a criminal conviction under section 270:29-a, thereby triggering the exclusion provision for property damage or minor injuries &#8212; that, is, for harms generally considered to be caused through civil negligence only. Exclusion of such a wide range of negligently caused loss or liability, he argues, would leave so few claims actually covered as to defeat the purpose of purchasing liability insurance in the first place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not concern ourselves with factual scenarios not presented by this case. Littlefield was convicted of the felony of criminally negligent homicide, not the misdemeanor of carelessly operating a power boat. Nevertheless, even if his conviction had been for the lesser offense, proof of the requisite culpable mental state would still be required for a conviction under New Hampshire state law. Section 625:9(II) of the New Hampshire Criminal Code makes the Code's definitions of culpable mental states applicable to misdemeanors codified outside the Criminal Code, such as section 270:29-a (unless the non-criminal statute provides otherwise, which section 270:29-a does not). Criminally negligent operation of a power boat, therefore, like all criminal negligence under New Hampshire state law, requires at least a \"fail[ure] to become aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk\" that \"constitutes a gross deviation from the conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the situation.\" N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 626:2(d) (2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, as Acadia points out, even in the absence of a statutory requirement of intent, under New Hampshire state law, \"a person cannot be convicted of a crime,\" including a misdemeanor, \"without proof that the unlawful act was accompanied by a culpable mental state.\" <i>State v. Goodwin,</i> 140 N.H. 672, 671 A.2d 554, 555 (1996). Negligent operation of a watercraft, in the absence of the requisite culpable mental state, could not be a crime and would not trigger the exclusion provision in Section B of the policy. Hence, criminal negligence differs from civil negligence under New Hampshire law in important ways,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> and the yacht policy provides meaningful coverage for loss or liability incurred through the latter (as well as, Acadia notes, through \"non-operational\" negligence such as negligent maintenance).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court noted, \"[w]hile reasonable people can disagree about whether an insurance company should be permitted to offer insurance that fails to cover liability that results from criminally negligent conduct, the arguments supporting Littlefield's position are not so strong as to render the clause unenforceable.\" <i>Littlefield,</i> 2004 WL 1064685, at *3 n. 2, 2004 U.S. Dist.

Ebinger,</i> 135 N.H. 264, 603 A.2d 924, 925 (1992) (\"Whether [a] defendant failed to become aware of a `substantial and unjustifiable risk' is determined by an objective test, not by reference to the defendant's subjective perception.\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> We also do not reach the question of whether the provision in Section G is unambiguous and enforceable as applied to these facts</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Littlefield also appealed from his criminal conviction on sufficiency of evidence as well as other grounds.

In the event that the New Hampshire Supreme Court grants a judgment of acquittal to Littlefield or remands for a new trial, the premise of the district court's ruling and ours will have changed. Littlefield could then move for relief in the district court from the district court's judgment on the ground that \"a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated.\"<i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(5).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The district court did not explicitly address either the parties' choice of federal maritime law as expressed in the insurance policy provision or its reasons for applying New Hampshire law as a consequence of the application of federal maritime law principles.

Answering both questions in the negative, we affirm the district court's order granting summary judgment to Defendant-Appellee Acadia Insurance Company (\"Acadia\") and denying summary judgment to Plaintiff-Appellant Daniel Littlefield in Littlefield's action seeking a declaratory judgment of coverage under the yacht insurance policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 11, 2002, Daniel Littlefield was operating a thirty-six-foot motorized pleasure boat insured under an Acadia \"yacht policy\" on Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire when it collided with another boat, killing one of that boat's passengers, John H. Hartman. In January 2003 Littlefield was indicted by a grand jury on two counts of criminally negligent homicide under sections 630:3(I) and (II) of the New Hampshire Criminal Code.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Also in January 2003, the victim's widow and executrix of his estate, Defendant-Appellant Karen K. Hartman (\"Hartman\"), brought a wrongful death action against Littlefield in New Hampshire state court alleging negligence. On April 3, 2003, Littlefield, in turn, sought a declaratory judgment in New Hampshire state court that Acadia was obligated under the terms of the yacht policy to provide him with insurance coverage, including a defense in Hartman's wrongful death suit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Acadia asserted that it had no such obligation under two separate provisions of the yacht policy, the first contained in Section B of the policy, which governs \"Protection and Indemnity Insurance,\" and the second contained in Section G, which sets forth \"General Conditions\" applicable to the entire policy. The provision in Section B excludes from coverage \"any loss, damage or liability willfully, intentionally or criminally caused or incurred by an insured person.\" The provision in Section G excludes coverage for \"any loss, damage or expense arising out of or during any illegal activity on your part or on the part of anyone using the insured's property with your permission.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> On May 2, 2003, Acadia removed the case to federal district court, citing both diversity and possible admiralty jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 20, 2003, a Belknap County Superior Court jury found Littlefield not guilty on the indictment's first count of \"negligently causing the death of another in the consequence of being under the influence of intoxicating liquor while operating a boat on Lake Winnepesaukee,\" a Class A felony, but guilty of the second count of \"negligently caus[ing] the death of another while operating a boat ... and fail[ing] to keep a proper lookout,\" a Class B felony. Citing principles of issue preclusion, Acadia moved for summary judgment in this case on the ground that Littlefield's criminal conviction rendered his potential liability in Hartman's wrongful death action \"criminally caused or incurred,\" as well as \"arising out of or during ... illegal activity\" within the meaning of the policy exclusions. Littlefield brought a cross-motion for summary judgment, arguing that the language of the policy exclusion in Section B of the policy is ambiguous and should be construed to provide coverage despite his criminal conviction. Littlefield asserted that a reasonable insured would interpret \"willfully, intentionally or criminally caused or incurred\" liability or losses to refer only to those caused or incurred through the commission of willful or intentional crimes. Under Littlefield's interpretation, liability incurred through the commission of unintentional crimes, including criminally negligent homicide, would not be excluded from coverage.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Littlefield also argued that enforcement of either the exclusion provision in Section B or Section G of the policy would leave so few claims actually covered as to render coverage under the policy illusory in contravention of public policy favoring compensation of innocent victims unintentionally harmed by an insured.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 11, 2004, the federal district court granted Acadia's motion for summary judgment and denied Littlefield's cross-motion for summary judgment, finding that coverage was excluded under the provision in Section B regarding \"any loss, damage or liability willfully, intentionally or criminally caused or incurred by an insured person.\" The court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well understood that negligence can be criminal when it results in death. The policy does not limit the exclusion to intentional crimes and the mere fact that the phrase is grouped with exclusions for willfully and intentionally caused acts would not cause a reasonably informed insured to read a limitation into the exclusion that it does not contain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Littlefield v.

In Littlefield's view, the first two words in the list in the Section B exclusion provision, \"willfully\" and \"intentionally,\" are \"words of a particular and specific meaning\" because they require a higher level of intent than negligence. By contrast, the word \"criminally,\" which encompasses a broad spectrum of culpable states of mind, is a \"general\" word that should not \"be construed in [its] widest extent, but [should] be held as applying only to\" crimes \"of the same kind or class\" as the acts encompassed by the preceding two words. That is to say, \"criminally\" should be read as limited by the same high threshold of intent as the words \"willfully\" and \"intentionally.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not agree. \"Criminally,\" when read after the words \"willfully\" and \"intentionally,\" is neither more general nor more specific than the two preceding words; it is merely different. Each of the three terms is \"general\" in the sense that each encompasses a broad range of specific acts. There is some overlap in the conduct excluded by these general terms. However, \"criminally\" encompasses both unintentional and intentional crimes, while \"willfully\" and \"intentionally\" encompass both non-criminal and criminal acts. Only \"criminally\" includes <i>un</i> intentional acts committed with a criminally culpable state of mind. Criminal negligence is such an act under the New Hampshire Criminal Code. N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 626:2(d) (2004). To read the word \"criminally\" to incorporate the limitations Littlefield seeks would render the word extraneous. Loss or liability caused through \"intentional\" crimes is already excluded as \"intentionally\" caused loss or liability. We decline to ignore the plain meaning of \"criminally\" in favor of a reading that would render the word superfluous. <i>See</i> Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#167; 203(a) (1981) (\"an interpretation which gives a reasonable, lawful, and effective meaning to all the terms is preferred to an interpretation which leaves a part unreasonable, unlawful, or of no effect\"); 2 Lee R. Russ, Couch on Insurance &#167; 22:43 (3d ed. 1995) (\"Since it must be assumed that each word contained in an insurance policy is intended to serve a purpose, every term will be given effect if that can be done by any reasonable construction.\"). More importantly, where a policy provision is unambiguous and the contracting parties' intent is thus clearly manifested in the plain language of that provision, resort to canons of interpretation is simply unwarranted. <i>See</i> Eric Mills Holmes &amp; Mark S. Rhodes, Holmes's Appleman on Insurance &#167; 5.1 (2d ed.1996) (courts may not \"resort to ... aids of construction where contract language is unambiguous.

In that case, the insurance policy purported to exclude coverage for injury \"which may reasonably be expected to result from the intentional or criminal acts of an insured person or which is in fact intended by an insured person.\" <i>Id.</i> at 752.

Policyholder's Ins. Co. v. Baker,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">958</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1346</span></span>, 1349 (1979) (\"[L]iability insurance is intended not only to indemnify the insured, but also to protect members of the public who may be injured through negligence.\"). In support of this claim, Littlefield points to a different New Hampshire criminal statute that renders \"careless and negligent\" operation of a power boat a misdemeanor and, therefore, a crime under the New Hampshire Criminal Code, regardless of the level of harm caused, as distinct from the statute under which he was convicted, which reaches only criminally negligent conduct that results in death. <i>Compare</i> N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 270:29-a (2004) (\"Careless and Negligent Operation of Boats\") <i>with</i> N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 630:3 (2004) (\"Negligent Homicide\"). Littlefield asserts that <i>any</i> negligent operation of a power boat could result in a criminal conviction under section 270:29-a, thereby triggering the exclusion provision for property damage or minor injuries &#8212; that, is, for harms generally considered to be caused through civil negligence only. Exclusion of such a wide range of negligently caused loss or liability, he argues, would leave so few claims actually covered as to defeat the purpose of purchasing liability insurance in the first place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not concern ourselves with factual scenarios not presented by this case. Littlefield was convicted of the felony of criminally negligent homicide, not the misdemeanor of carelessly operating a power boat. Nevertheless, even if his conviction had been for the lesser offense, proof of the requisite culpable mental state would still be required for a conviction under New Hampshire state law. Section 625:9(II) of the New Hampshire Criminal Code makes the Code's definitions of culpable mental states applicable to misdemeanors codified outside the Criminal Code, such as section 270:29-a (unless the non-criminal statute provides otherwise, which section 270:29-a does not). Criminally negligent operation of a power boat, therefore, like all criminal negligence under New Hampshire state law, requires at least a \"fail[ure] to become aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk\" that \"constitutes a gross deviation from the conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the situation.\" N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 626:2(d) (2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, as Acadia points out, even in the absence of a statutory requirement of intent, under New Hampshire state law, \"a person cannot be convicted of a crime,\" including a misdemeanor, \"without proof that the unlawful act was accompanied by a culpable mental state.\" <i>State v. Goodwin,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">672</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">671</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">554</span></span>, 555 (1996). Negligent operation of a watercraft, in the absence of the requisite culpable mental state, could not be a crime and would not trigger the exclusion provision in Section B of the policy. Hence, criminal negligence differs from civil negligence under New Hampshire law in important ways,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> and the yacht policy provides meaningful coverage for loss or liability incurred through the latter (as well as, Acadia notes, through \"non-operational\" negligence such as negligent maintenance).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court noted, \"[w]hile reasonable people can disagree about whether an insurance company should be permitted to offer insurance that fails to cover liability that results from criminally negligent conduct, the arguments supporting Littlefield's position are not so strong as to render the clause unenforceable.\" <i>Littlefield,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1064685</span></span>, at *3 n. 2, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S. Dist.

Littlefield could then move for relief in the district court from the district court's judgment on the ground that \"a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated.\"<i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(5).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The district court did not explicitly address either the parties' choice of federal maritime law as expressed in the insurance policy provision or its reasons for applying New Hampshire law as a consequence of the application of federal maritime law principles.

Although the record in this case does not permit an exhaustive analysis of the contacts of the parties or the insurance policy with the state of New Hampshire, we are satisfied that the contacts that do appear in the record &#8212; namely, the New Hampshire citizenship of the insured (Littlefield), and the storage and operation of the subject matter of the insurance contract (the yacht) in that state &#8212; adequately support the application of New Hampshire law in this case. <i>See, e.g., Aqua-Marine Constructors, Inc. v.
