Daniel R. Domínguez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                     Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                  Selya, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Alexander Zeno on brief for appellant.\n     Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant U.S. Attorney, and Rosa Emilia\nRodríguez-Velez, United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          December 19, 2007\n\f               Per Curiam.      Defendant-appellant Plutarco de la Cruz\n\n pled guilty to possessing marijuana with intent to distribute\n\n and conspiring to import marijuana into the United States after\n\n being intercepted with six others in a vessel off the coast of\n\n Puerto       Rico    carrying    approximately       2,500     kilograms    of\n\n marijuana.      The defendant requested a downward adjustment in\n\n his federal sentencing guidelines offense level, arguing that\n\n he had been only a minor participant in the offenses.                      The\n\n district court denied the adjustment and, after several days of\n\n sentencing hearings in which the defendant testified, granted\n\n him a \"safety valve\" adjustment.               The court sentenced the\n\n defendant to 70 months in prison (the bottom of the applicable\n\n guideline imprisonment range).\n\n               On appeal, the defendant raises five issues. Because\n\n we find none of them to have merit, we summarily affirm his\n\n conviction and sentence.\n\n               I. Guilty Plea\n\n          The defendant argues that he is entitled to specific\n\nperformance      of    the    government's     alleged        initial   \"partial\n\noral/written agreement\" pursuant to which he and his co-defendants\n\nwere permitted to plead guilty while reserving their rights to\n\nappeal from the denial of their motion to suppress.                 The defendant\n\nconcedes in his brief, however, that he \"pleaded guilty afterwards,\n\nnot   based     on    the    unfulfilled    promise    of     the   prosecutor.\"\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fAppellant's Brief at 30.     Even assuming that at the time of the\n\ninitial change-of-plea hearing in October of 2004 there existed an\n\n\"informal agreement\" that the defendant would be permitted to plead\n\nguilty without waiving the right to appeal from the denial of the\n\nsuppression motion, he does not argue that the actual plea, entered\n\nthree months later, was pursuant to such an agreement.          His \"plea\n\nwas thus in no sense the product of governmental deception; it\n\nrested on no 'unfulfilled promise.'\" Mabry v. Johnson, 467 U.S.\n\n504, 510 (1984).   Consequently, the defendant is not entitled to\n\nspecific performance of the alleged initial \"partial oral/written\n\nagreement.\"\n\n          II. Role in the Offense\n\n          The defendant claims that the district court erred in\n\ndenying his request for a two-level reduction for his minor role in\n\nthe offenses of conviction. \"[A] defendant who aspires to be\n\nclassified as a minor participant bears the burden of proving that\n\nhe is both (i) less culpable than most other participants in the\n\noffenses of conviction, and (ii) less culpable than the average\n\nmiscreant involved in offenses of the same genre.\" United States v.\n\nSanchez, 354 F.3d 70, 74 (1st Cir. 2004).       \"Review of the decision\n\nto deny a downward adjustment for minor role is for clear error.\"\n\nUnited States v. Morales-Madera, 352 F.3d 1, 14 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n\"If the record supports at least two permissible inferences, the\n\nfactfinder's   choice   between   or   among   them   cannot   be   clearly\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\ferroneous.         Accordingly, we rarely reverse a district court's\n\ndecision regarding whether to apply a minor role adjustment.\"\n\nUnited States v. Bravo, 489 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,\n\n128 S.Ct. 344 (2007).\n\n              In   determining    that     the   defendant      was    not   a    minor\n\nparticipant, the sentencing court relied upon the defendant's own\n\ntestimony that 1) he had been given a cell phone and assigned\n\nresponsibility for making the contact with the intended recipient\n\nof the drugs when the vessel reached Puerto Rico, and 2) that he\n\nhad originally been recruited to participate in the drug smuggling\n\nscheme    because     of   his   familiarity     with   the     coastline        of   the\n\nDominican Republic, the original planned destination.\n\n              The defendant maintains in his brief that \"[t]here is no\n\nfactual controversy\" regarding the role in the offense and that the\n\nissue    he   raises   \"turns     merely    on   whether   or    not    [Plutarco's\n\nadmitted] conduct can be considered minimal, minor or average.\" In\n\nthis regard, he argues that the court erred in relying upon the\n\nsecond factor -- his knowledge of the Dominican coastline. Because\n\nthe drugs were brought into the United States and the boat never\n\ntraveled to the Dominican Republic, he argues that the second\n\nfactor was irrelevant.\n\n              We disagree.       The court relied upon the fact that the\n\ndefendant \"was hired initially as the man that was going to\n\nnavigate the boat through the waters of Santo Domingo.\"                      Although\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fthe boat did not end up traveling to the Dominican Republic, it\n\ndoes not appear clearly erroneous for the court to have inferred\n\nthat a person chosen to navigate the boat into the port of arrival\n\nwas also a person charged with responsibility for other important\n\ntasks.\n\n             The defendant also argues that his role in the offenses\n\nshould have been assessed in the context of the \"whole scenario,\"\n\nand in comparison with the roles of \"the sellers and buyers of the\n\nshipment\" and the distributors in the United States.               He contends\n\nthat his    role was minor because it was limited \"to aid[ing] in the\n\ntransportation of drugs from one point to the other.\"                However,\n\n\"role-in-the-offense adjustments depend . . . on comparing each\n\noffender's actions and relative culpability with the elements of\n\nthe offense.\" United States v. Ocasio, 914 F.2d 330, 333 (1st Cir.\n\n1990).     Here,   the defendant was not charged with distribution of\n\nthe   drugs.       He   was   charged   with   possession   with    intent   to\n\ndistribute and with conspiring to import drugs. Therefore, he \"had\n\na hand in each of the essential elements of the                    offense of\n\nconviction,\" id., and the district court did not clearly err in\n\nfailing to compare his role with unidentified purchasers, sellers,\n\nand distributors of the marijuana.\n\n             III. Failure to Depart\n\n             The defendant claims that the sentencing court erred in\n\nnot granting him a downward departure on the ground of duress, as\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fwas granted to several of his co-defendants.   He testified at his\n\nsentencing hearing that when he learned that the drugs were to be\n\ndelivered to Puerto Rico instead of the Dominican Republic, he\n\nwanted to abandon the venture, but felt that he \"had no alternative\n\nbut to get in the boat.\"\n\n          The defendant's failure to seek a downward departure on\n\nthis basis in the district court forecloses our consideration of\n\nthe issue. See United States v. Morales-Madera, 352 F.3d 1, 14 (1st\n\nCir. 2003).   Moreover, even if the court had denied a request by\n\nthe defendant for a departure on this ground, \"on appeal, we only\n\nhave jurisdiction to review if 'the sentencing court's failure to\n\ndepart did not represent an exercise of factfinding or discretion,\n\nbut was instead the product of the court's miscalculation about\n\nwhether it possessed the authority to depart.'\" Bravo, 489 F.3d at\n\n12-13. Given that the court granted downward departures for duress\n\nfor some co-defendants, it was clearly aware of its authority to\n\ndepart on that basis.\n\n          IV. Booker Error\n\n          The defendant argues that United States v. Booker, 543\n\nU.S. 220 (2005), prohibited the sentencing court from increasing\n\nhis sentence based on judicial findings of fact, including role in\n\nthe offense, and that such determinations must be made by a jury.\n\nAs an initial matter, the court did not increase the defendant's\n\nsentence based on judicial findings of fact regarding his role in\n\n\n                               -6-\n\fthe offense; it merely declined to reduce his sentence on that\n\nbasis.   Moreover, where as in this case the sentence does not\n\nexceed the statutory maximum for the offenses to which defendant\n\npled guilty, this court has held that \"[u]nder Booker, a judge may\n\ndo such fact finding in determining the Guidelines range.   Nothing\n\nin Booker requires submission of such facts to a jury so long as\n\nthe Guidelines are not mandatory.\" United States v. Antonakopoulos,\n\n399 F.3d 68, 80 (1st Cir. 2005).   The sentencing court applied the\n\nadvisory guidelines and there was no Booker error.\n\n          V. Judicial Bias\n\n          The defendant claims judicial bias by the judge who\n\nsentenced him and seeks resentencing before a new judge. We review\n\nfor abuse of discretion the refusal of a trial judge to recuse\n\nhimself. United States v. Ayala, 289 F.3d 16, 27 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n\"[D]isqualification is appropriate when 'the facts asserted provide\n\nwhat an objective, knowledgeable member of the public would find to\n\nbe a reasonable basis for doubting the judge's impartiality.'\" Id.\n\n(citation omitted).   Here, the issue of bias was raised in a motion\n\nfiled by defense counsel on April 1, 2005, to withdraw from\n\nrepresenting the defendant. The motion cited as \"evidence\" of\n\npotential bias the judge's comments critical of the attorney's\n\nperformance during the March 31, 2005 sentencing hearing.\n\n          [J]udicial remarks during the course of trial\n          that are critical or disapproving of, or even\n          hostile to, counsel, the parties, or their\n          cases, ordinarily do not support a bias or\n\n                                -7-\n\f           partiality challenge. They may do so if they\n           reveal an opinion that derives from an\n           extrajudicial source; and they will do so if\n           they reveal such a high degree of favoritism\n           or antagonism as to make fair judgment\n           impossible.\n\n\nLiteky v. United States, 510 U.S. 540, 555 (1994).           The defendant\n\nhas not alleged an extrajudicial source from which the alleged bias\n\nwas derived.   The transcript of the sentencing hearing does not\n\nreveal \"such a high degree of favoritism or antagonism as to make\n\nfair judgment impossible.\" Id.   The defendant's bias claim relies\n\nlargely upon the district court's tone of voice rather than the\n\nwords   themselves.   At   bottom,     then,   his   claim    relies   upon\n\n\"expressions of impatience, dissatisfaction, annoyance, and even\n\nanger,\" which the Supreme Court has ruled do not establish bias or\n\npartiality. Id. at 555-56.   When the sentencing hearing resumed on\n\nApril 4, 2005, the court specifically denied any animus toward\n\ndefense counsel and explained that it was concerned about the lack\n\nof legal basis for some of the arguments made by counsel.          At this\n\npoint, counsel for the defendant confirmed that he did not feel\n\nthat the court had been \"ironic\" with him during that day's\n\nhearing.\n\n           The other grounds on which the defendant rests his\n\npresent claim of judicial bias implicate judicial rulings in the\n\ncase, including the denial of the defendant's request for a two-\n\nlevel reduction for a minor role in the offenses.            It is settled\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fthat \"judicial rulings alone almost never constitute a valid basis\n\nfor a bias or partiality motion. . . .     Almost invariably, they are\n\nproper grounds for appeal, not for recusal.\" Id. at 555.        Such is\n\nthe case here, where the rulings neither show a reliance upon an\n\nextrajudicial    source   nor   display   the   requisite   \"deep-seated\n\nfavoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment impossible.\"\n\nId.      Instead, the transcripts of the sentencing hearings reveal\n\nthat the district court went to great lengths to ensure fairness in\n\nthe defendant's sentencing.\n\n            The conviction and sentence are affirmed. See 1st Cir. R.\n\n27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\f",

Ocasio, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548346\"><a href=\"/opinion/548346/united-states-v-gilberto-ocasio-aka-gilberto-ocasio-agosto/\"><span class=\"volume\">914</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">330</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 333 (1st Cir.\n\n1990).     Here,   the defendant was not charged with distribution of\n\nthe   drugs.       He   was   charged   with   possession   with    intent   to\n\ndistribute and with conspiring to import drugs. Therefore, he \"had\n\na hand in each of the essential elements of the                    offense of\n\nconviction,\" id., and the district court did not clearly err in\n\nfailing to compare his role with unidentified purchasers, sellers,\n\nand distributors of the marijuana.\n\n             III. Failure to Depart\n\n             The defendant claims that the sentencing court erred in\n\nnot granting him a downward departure on the ground of duress, as\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fwas granted to several of his co-defendants.   He testified at his\n\nsentencing hearing that when he learned that the drugs were to be\n\ndelivered to Puerto Rico instead of the Dominican Republic, he\n\nwanted to abandon the venture, but felt that he \"had no alternative\n\nbut to get in the boat.\"\n\n          The defendant's failure to seek a downward departure on\n\nthis basis in the district court forecloses our consideration of\n\nthe issue. See United States v. Morales-Madera, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200736\"><a href=\"/opinion/200736/united-states-v-rivera-rosario/\"><span class=\"volume\">352</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 14 (1st\n\nCir. 2003).   Moreover, even if the court had denied a request by\n\nthe defendant for a departure on this ground, \"on appeal, we only\n\nhave jurisdiction to review if 'the sentencing court's failure to\n\ndepart did not represent an exercise of factfinding or discretion,\n\nbut was instead the product of the court's miscalculation about\n\nwhether it possessed the authority to depart.'\" Bravo, 489 F.3d at\n\n12-13. Given that the court granted downward departures for duress\n\nfor some co-defendants, it was clearly aware of its authority to\n\ndepart on that basis.\n\n          IV. Booker Error\n\n          The defendant argues that United States v. Booker, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2005), prohibited the sentencing court from increasing\n\nhis sentence based on judicial findings of fact, including role in\n\nthe offense, and that such determinations must be made by a jury.\n\nAs an initial matter, the court did not increase the defendant's\n\nsentence based on judicial findings of fact regarding his role in\n\n\n                               -6-\n\fthe offense; it merely declined to reduce his sentence on that\n\nbasis.   Moreover, where as in this case the sentence does not\n\nexceed the statutory maximum for the offenses to which defendant\n\npled guilty, this court has held that \"[u]nder Booker, a judge may\n\ndo such fact finding in determining the Guidelines range.   Nothing\n\nin Booker requires submission of such facts to a jury so long as\n\nthe Guidelines are not mandatory.\" United States v. Antonakopoulos,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201462\"><a href=\"/opinion/201462/united-states-v-antonakopoulos/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 80 (1st Cir. 2005).   The sentencing court applied the\n\nadvisory guidelines and there was no Booker error.\n\n          V. Judicial Bias\n\n          The defendant claims judicial bias by the judge who\n\nsentenced him and seeks resentencing before a new judge. We review\n\nfor abuse of discretion the refusal of a trial judge to recuse\n\nhimself. United States v. Ayala, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199930\"><a href=\"/opinion/199930/united-states-v-ayala-ayala/\"><span class=\"volume\">289</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 27 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n\"[D]isqualification is appropriate when 'the facts asserted provide\n\nwhat an objective, knowledgeable member of the public would find to\n\nbe a reasonable basis for doubting the judge's impartiality.'\" Id.\n\n(citation omitted).   Here, the issue of bias was raised in a motion\n\nfiled by defense counsel on April 1, 2005, to withdraw from\n\nrepresenting the defendant. The motion cited as \"evidence\" of\n\npotential bias the judge's comments critical of the attorney's\n\nperformance during the March 31, 2005 sentencing hearing.\n\n          [J]udicial remarks during the course of trial\n          that are critical or disapproving of, or even\n          hostile to, counsel, the parties, or their\n          cases, ordinarily do not support a bias or\n\n                                -7-\n\f           partiality challenge. They may do so if they\n           reveal an opinion that derives from an\n           extrajudicial source; and they will do so if\n           they reveal such a high degree of favoritism\n           or antagonism as to make fair judgment\n           impossible.\n\n\nLiteky v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112935\"><a href=\"/opinion/112935/liteky-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">540</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 555 (1994).           The defendant\n\nhas not alleged an extrajudicial source from which the alleged bias\n\nwas derived.   The transcript of the sentencing hearing does not\n\nreveal \"such a high degree of favoritism or antagonism as to make\n\nfair judgment impossible.\" Id.   The defendant's bias claim relies\n\nlargely upon the district court's tone of voice rather than the\n\nwords   themselves.   At   bottom,     then,   his   claim    relies   upon\n\n\"expressions of impatience, dissatisfaction, annoyance, and even\n\nanger,\" which the Supreme Court has ruled do not establish bias or\n\npartiality. Id. at 555-56.   When the sentencing hearing resumed on\n\nApril 4, 2005, the court specifically denied any animus toward\n\ndefense counsel and explained that it was concerned about the lack\n\nof legal basis for some of the arguments made by counsel.          At this\n\npoint, counsel for the defendant confirmed that he did not feel\n\nthat the court had been \"ironic\" with him during that day's\n\nhearing.\n\n           The other grounds on which the defendant rests his\n\npresent claim of judicial bias implicate judicial rulings in the\n\ncase, including the denial of the defendant's request for a two-\n\nlevel reduction for a minor role in the offenses.            It is settled\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fthat \"judicial rulings alone almost never constitute a valid basis\n\nfor a bias or partiality motion. . . .     Almost invariably, they are\n\nproper grounds for appeal, not for recusal.\" Id. at 555.        Such is\n\nthe case here, where the rulings neither show a reliance upon an\n\nextrajudicial    source   nor   display   the   requisite   \"deep-seated\n\nfavoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment impossible.\"\n\nId.      Instead, the transcripts of the sentencing hearings reveal\n\nthat the district court went to great lengths to ensure fairness in\n\nthe defendant's sentencing.\n\n            The conviction and sentence are affirmed. See 1st Cir. R.\n\n27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\f</pre>",
