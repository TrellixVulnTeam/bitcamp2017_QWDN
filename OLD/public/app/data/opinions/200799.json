After\n\ncareful review of the record and the parties' briefs, we affirm,\n\nessentially for the reasons given by the district court in its\n\nMemorandum and Order dated April 3, 2003.                We add only the\n\nfollowing comments.\n\n       We see no need to decide whether the double jeopardy claim was\n\nbarred by res judicata, as the district court held, because that\n\nclaim was properly dismissed for other reasons.

But the defendants played no role in securing the time\n\nserved sentence on the armed robbery conviction.             Therefore, they\n\ncannot be held liable for any failure to give the sentence credit.\n\n       Furthermore, there is no basis for any suit against the\n\nindividual     defendant,     Boston    police   detective   Eugene   Hurley.\n\nHurley had probable cause to seek the armed robbery arrest warrant,\n\nand he is absolutely immune with respect to his testimony before\n\nthe grand jury, Kyricopoulos v.
