Patti B. Saris, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                         Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n\n                    Merritt,* Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                       and Howard, Circuit Judge,\n\n\n\n     Adam J. Bookbinder, Assistant U.S. Attorney, with whom Michael\nJ. Sullivan, U.S. Attorney, was on brief for appellant.\n     Peter B. Krupp with whom Lurie & Krupp, LLP was on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n                              May 22, 2008\n\n\n\n\n      *\n          Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f      MERRITT, Senior Circuit Judge. Oleksiy Sharapka was sentenced\n\nto 121 months’ imprisonment after he pled guilty to a 13-count\n\ninformation    alleging   identity    theft,    counterfeiting,      and   mail\n\nfraud. The charges stemmed from the defendant's illegal activities\n\nin Georgia — a state that he had fled during pretrial custody1 —\n\nand in Boston, Massachusetts.        At the time of his arrest, Sharapka\n\nwas found with approximately 315 stolen credit card numbers, “ID\n\nkits,” various other PIN and credit card numbers, and equipment\n\nvalued at over $80,000.2\n\n      In this appeal, the defendant challenges his sentence on two\n\ngrounds.    First, he argues as a factual matter that the district\n\ncourt improperly determined that ten or more victims suffered\n\nfinancial losses due to his activities, a finding that increased\n\nhis sentence by two levels.     See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual\n\n(“Guidelines”) § 2B1.1(b)(2)(A) (2005). And second, he argues that\n\nthe district court erred in imposing a two-level enhancement for\n\npossession of device-making equipment pursuant to § 2B1.1(b)(10)(A)\n\nof   the   Guidelines.    The   defendant      does   not   raise   any    Sixth\n\nAmendment sentencing issue under the Blakely-Booker-Cunningham line\n\nof cases.    See Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296 (2004); United\n\n\n      1\n      The federal charges from Georgia were incorporated into the\n13-count information in this case.\n      2\n       Sharapka’s scheme operated as follows: he would order\nmerchandise online using the stolen credit cards, have the items\nsent to Mail Boxes Etc., arrange for someone to deliver the items\nto his house, and then ship them overseas (primarily to Russia).\n\n                                  - 2 -\n\fStates v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005); Cunningham v. California,\n\n549 U.S. 270 (2007).\n\n      For the following reasons, we affirm the district court's\n\nsentence of 121 months.\n\n\n\nI. Sharapka’s sentence\n\n      Because the defendant only challenges the sentence, and not\n\nthe underlying conviction, we will only address the facts pertinent\n\nto the issues raised.      At sentencing, the district court found a\n\nbase offense level of seven under § 2B1.1(a)(1) of the Guidelines,\n\nand then added the following enhancements: (1) 14 levels for the\n\nstipulated loss ($400,000 to $1,000,000), (2) two levels for more\n\nthan 10 but fewer than 50 victims, (3) two levels for receipt of\n\nstolen property, (4) three levels for the commission of an offense\n\nwhile on release, (5) two levels for possession of device-making\n\nequipment, and (6) two levels for managerial role in the offense.\n\nThe   court    then     deducted     two     levels   for   acceptance   of\n\nresponsibility.      The resulting offense level of 30 corresponded to\n\na Guidelines sentencing range of 97-121 months. In addition, there\n\nwas   a   24-month   mandatory     consecutive   sentence   for   aggravated\n\nidentity fraud, which, when added to the level 30 offense, resulted\n\nin a range of 121-145 months.              See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines\n\nManual § 2B1.6 (2005).     The district court then sentenced Sharapka\n\nto the bottom of this range, 121 months.\n\n\n                                     - 3 -\n\f      We review findings of fact at sentencing hearings for clear\n\nerror and legal issues de novo.   United States v. Pacheco, 489 F.3d\n\n40, 44 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n\n\nII.   The enhancement for more than 10 but fewer than 50 \"victims\"\n\n      At the first day of the sentencing hearing, a government agent\n\ntestified that the issuing banks suffered direct financial losses\n\nas a result of Sharapka’s credit card fraud.       However, another\n\nagent later testified that he had been unable to quantify these\n\nvalues because banks purge credit card accounts that are the\n\nsubject of fraud. The government maintained that the issuing bank,\n\nand not the credit card company, suffered the direct financial loss\n\nas a result of the fraudulent use.3    After the second day of the\n\nsentencing trial, the district court indicated that it was still\n\nunsure as to whether there were, in fact, more than 10 victims who\n\nsuffered a financial loss.\n\n      On the third day of the sentencing hearing, the government\n\nintroduced a proffer — based on its conversation with American\n\nExpress — that the vendor, and not the card-issuing bank, actually\n\nsuffered the financial losses due to Sharapka’s activities.     The\n\ngovernment then provided a list of 14 vendors its agents had\n\n\n      3\n       The government provided evidence that Sharapka had used 10\nor more cards, but conceded that it lacked sufficient evidence to\nprove that Sharakpa had used each of these cards. The evidence\nonly showed that American Express had suffered a discernible,\nactual loss.\n\n                               - 4 -\n\fcontacted and who had reported losses due to Sharapka’s illegal\n\npurchases.     Based   on   this   newly   introduced    information,     the\n\ndistrict court imposed a two-level increase to the defendant’s\n\nsentence.    The defendant contends that the court erred by relying\n\non this proffer; specifically, he argues that the proffer fails to\n\nlink the alleged losses (i.e. items seized at Sharapka’s apartment)\n\nand that the court’s analysis of the document was insufficient. In\n\naddition, the defendant notes that the government was unable to\n\nconfirm   losses   attributable    to   specific   entities     at   a   later\n\nrestitution hearing.\n\n     The United States Sentencing Guidelines permit a court to\n\nincrease a criminal defendant’s sentence by two levels if the\n\noffense involved “10 or more victims.”       U.S. Sentencing Guidelines\n\nManual § 2B1.1(b)(2)(A) (2005).         To support such an enhancement,\n\nthe sentencing judge must find that 10 or more victims suffered\n\nactual loss by a preponderance of the evidence.           United States v.\n\nLeahy, 473 F.3d 401, 413 (1st Cir. 2007).          The Guidelines define\n\n“actual loss” as the “reasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm that\n\nresulted from the offense.”        U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual §\n\n2B1.1 (2005), cmt. n.3.     The same explanatory note indicates that\n\ndeference is owed to a sentencing judge’s determination of the\n\nloss: “The court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss.\n\nThe sentencing judge is in a unique position to assess the evidence\n\nand estimate the loss based on that evidence.”          Id.   In the instant\n\n\n                                   - 5 -\n\fcase, we believe that the district court’s determination that\n\nvendors   were    included       within   the     definition    of    “victim”      was\n\ncorrect, and also that the record adequately supports the two-level\n\nincrease for more than 10 victims.\n\n       As described supra, the government first argued that only\n\nfinancial institutions could suffer losses under § 2B1.1(b)(2)(A),\n\nand then amended their theory to also include vendors. This change\n\nresulted from an agent’s discussion with American Express in which\n\nthe    government      learned    that    banks     suffer     losses      caused   by\n\nfraudulent ATM use, while vendors incur losses resulting from\n\nfraudulent   credit      card    use.      At    the   sentencing     hearing,      the\n\ndefendant contended that this new interpretation was incorrect. We\n\nbelieve   that    the    district    court       properly    relied   on    both    the\n\ntestimony regarding the conversation with American Express and the\n\nSentencing Guidelines explanatory notes, which defines “victims”\n\nfor    purposes   of    §   2B1.1(b)(2)(A)        as   including      “individuals,\n\ncorporations, companies . . .” See U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(2)(A), cmt.\n\nn.1.   Such a definition is broader than financial institutions and\n\nfairly encompasses the vendors identified by the government agents.\n\n       As a result, the question is whether the government provided\n\nsufficient evidence to support the court’s finding that more than\n\n10 vendors suffered financial losses due to Sharapka’s credit card\n\nfraud.    The government proffered that its agents had contacted 14\n\nvendors who verified that they had suffered losses resulting from\n\n\n                                         - 6 -\n\fthis fraud.       In addition, the government provided a spreadsheet\n\nlisting the amount of loss and specific vendors for fraudulent\n\npurchases made using American Express cards.                   The government then\n\ngave the information about the 14 vendors to defense counsel and\n\nthe court.     The defendant contends that because the government did\n\nnot later rely on the same information at the restitution hearing,\n\nthe    district    court    should     have    disregarded       this   evidence   at\n\nsentencing.\n\n       We    believe,       however,       that    the    government’s        factual\n\ndetermination — based on the government’s proffer — was sufficient\n\nto support its enhancement under clear error review. The fact that\n\nthe government did not later rely on the same 14 vendors at the\n\nrestitution       hearing    does    not    necessarily        cast   doubt   on   the\n\nsentencing phase; rather, it appears that vendors may, for various\n\nreasons, have chosen not to submit the victim impact statements\n\nnecessary to qualify for restitution.               Similarly, we believe that\n\nthe spreadsheet identifying the 14 vendors sufficiently connects\n\ntheir losses to Sharapka’s fraudulent activities. Accordingly, the\n\ntwo-level enhancement was proper.\n\n\n\nIII.    The enhancement for possession of device-making equipment\n\n       The   defendant      also    contends      that   the    court’s   two-level\n\nenhancement for possession of “device-making equipment” resulted in\n\nimpermissible double counting.                See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines\n\n\n                                        - 7 -\n\fManual § 2B1.1(b)(10)(A)(i) (2005).              This enhancement stemmed from\n\nthe discovery of a read/write scanning device at the defendant’s\n\nhome.   According to Sharapka, the mandatory, consecutive sentence\n\nfor aggravated identity theft — punishable under § 2B1.6 of the\n\nGuidelines — precludes application of a two-level increase for\n\nspecific offense characteristics under § 2B1.1(b)(10).\n\n      Section § 2B1.6 compels the sentencing court to impose a\n\nconsecutive punishment for identity theft counts punishable under\n\n18   U.S.C.    §    1028A     (i.e.,    counts    eleven    and    twelve    of    the\n\ninformation        to   which   Sharapka     pled    guilty).        However,      the\n\ncommentary to the Guidelines states that “if a sentence under this\n\nguideline     is    imposed     in   conjunction     with   a     sentence   for    an\n\nunderlying     offense,         do     not   apply    any       specific     offense\n\ncharacteristic for the transfer, possession, or use of a means of\n\nidentification . . .”           U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual § 2B1.6\n\n(2005), cmt. n.2 (emphasis added).              This section therefore applies\n\nto certain enhancements under § 2B1.1(b)(10), but not to all.\n\nSection 2B1.1(b)(10) reads as follows:\n\n      If the offense involved (A) the possession or use of any\n      (i) device-making equipment, or (ii) authentication\n      feature; (B) the production or trafficking of any (i)\n      unauthorized access device or counterfeit access device,\n      or (ii) authentication feature; or (C) (i) the\n      unauthorized   transfer   or  use   of   any  means   of\n      identification unlawfully to produce or obtain any other\n      means of identification, or (ii) the possession of 5 or\n      more means of identification that unlawfully were\n      produced from, or obtained by the use of, another means\n      of identification, increase by 2 levels.\n\n\n                                        - 8 -\n\f(emphasis     added).           The    defendant     argues    that       because     §\n\n2B1.1(b)(10)(C)(i)         includes       the       language    “transfer”          and\n\n“possession,” the prohibition under note 2 of § 2B1.6 operates to\n\nbar application of any enhancement.                 The government responds by\n\narguing that the enhancement in this case resulted solely from “the\n\npossession or use of device-making” equipment, which makes § 2B1.6\n\ninapplicable.\n\n      We believe that the plain language supports the government’s\n\nargument.     § 2B1.1(b)(10) lists different offense characteristics,\n\nseparated by the conjunction “or,” whose presence may justify a\n\ntwo-level enhancement. Had the court imposed the enhancement under\n\n§ 2B1.1(b)(10)(C)(i), then § 2B1.6 would preclude application of a\n\ntwo-level enhancement.            In Sharapka’s case, however, the court\n\nimposed its enhancement after finding that the defendant possessed\n\n“device-making equipment” — to wit, a read/write device.                          This\n\nfinding       implicates         §     2B1.1(b)(10)(A)(i)           and     not      §\n\n2B1.1(b)(10)(C)(i); the two are different offense characteristics.\n\nBecause   §    2B1.6     does    not   cover    possession     of    device-making\n\nequipment, the court acted appropriately in applying both the\n\nmandatory minimum under § 2B1.6 and the two-level enhancement under\n\n§   2B1.1(b)(10)(A)(i).          To    hold    otherwise    would    result   in    an\n\nexpansion     of   the   application      of    §   2B1.6   beyond    the   specific\n\ncharacteristics identified by the Guidelines in the explanatory\n\ntext.\n\n\n                                        - 9 -\n\fWe therefore affirm Sharapka’s sentence.\n\n\n\n\n                        - 10 -\n\f",

The charges stemmed from the defendant's illegal activities in Georgia  a state that he had fled during pretrial custody<sup>[1]</sup>  and in Boston, Massachusetts. At the time of his arrest, Sharapka was found with approximately 315 stolen credit card numbers, \"ID kits,\" various other PIN and credit card numbers, and equipment valued at over $80,000.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>In this appeal, the defendant challenges his sentence on two grounds. First, he argues as a factual matter that the district court improperly determined that ten or more victims suffered financial losses due to his activities, a finding that increased his sentence by two levels. <i>See</i> U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\"Guidelines\") § 2B1.1(b)(2)(A) (2005). And second, he argues that the district court erred in imposing a two-level enhancement for possession of device-making equipment pursuant to § 2B1.1(b)(10)(A) of the Guidelines. The defendant does not raise any Sixth Amendment sentencing issue under the <i>Blakely-Booker-Cunningham</i> line of cases. <i>See </i><i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004); <i>United States v.

California,</i> 549 U.S. 270, 127 S.Ct. 856, 166 L.Ed.2d 856 (2007).</p>\n<p>For the following reasons, we affirm the district court's sentence of 121 months.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Sharapka's sentence</h2>\n<p>Because the defendant only challenges the sentence, and not the underlying conviction, we will only address the facts pertinent to the issues raised. At sentencing, the district court found a base offense level of seven under § 2B1.1(a)(1) of the Guidelines, and then added the following enhancements: (1) 14 levels for the stipulated loss ($400,000 to $1,000,000), (2) two levels for more than 10 but fewer than 50 victims, (3) two levels for receipt of stolen property, (4) three levels for the commission of an offense while on release, (5) two levels for possession of device-making equipment, and (6) two levels for managerial role in the offense. The court then deducted two levels for acceptance of responsibility. The resulting offense level of 30 corresponded to a Guidelines sentencing range of 97-121 months. In addition, there was a 24-month mandatory consecutive sentence for aggravated identity fraud, which, when added to the level 30 offense, resulted in a range of 121-145 months. <i>See</i> U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual § 2B1.6 (2005). The district court then sentenced Sharapka to the bottom of this range, 121 months.</p>\n<p>We review findings of fact at sentencing hearings for clear error and legal issues de novo. <i>United States v. Pacheco,</i> 489 F.3d 40, 44 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. The enhancement for more than 10 but fewer than 50 \"victims\"</h2>\n<p>At the first day of the sentencing hearing, a government agent testified that the issuing banks suffered direct financial losses as a result of Sharapka's credit card fraud. However, another agent later testified that he had been unable to quantify these values because banks purge credit card accounts that are the subject of fraud. The government maintained that the issuing bank, and not the credit card company, suffered the direct financial loss as a result of the fraudulent use.<sup>[3]</sup> After the second day of the sentencing trial, the district court indicated that it was still unsure as to whether there were, in fact, more than 10 victims who suffered a financial loss.</p>\n<p>On the third day of the sentencing hearing, the government introduced a proffer  based on its conversation with American Express  that the vendor, and not the card-issuing bank, actually suffered the financial losses due to Sharapka's activities. The government then provided a list of 14 vendors its agents had contacted and who had reported losses due to Sharapka's illegal purchases. Based on this newly introduced information, the district court imposed a two-level increase to the defendant's sentence. The defendant contends that the court erred by relying on this proffer; specifically, he argues that the proffer fails to link the alleged losses (<i>i.e.</i> items seized at Sharapka's apartment) and that the court's analysis of the document was insufficient. In addition, the defendant notes that the government was unable to confirm losses attributable to specific entities at a later restitution hearing.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*61</span> The United States Sentencing Guidelines permit a court to increase a criminal defendant's sentence by two levels if the offense involved \"10 or more victims.\" U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual § 2B1.1(b)(2)(A) (2005). To support such an enhancement, the sentencing judge must find that 10 or more victims suffered actual loss by a preponderance of the evidence. <i>United States v. Leahy,</i> 473 F.3d 401, 413 (1st Cir.2007). The Guidelines define \"actual loss\" as the \"reasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm that resulted from the offense.\" U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual § 2B1.1 (2005), cmt. n. 3. The same explanatory note indicates that deference is owed to a sentencing judge's determination of the loss: \"The court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss. The sentencing judge is in a unique position to assess the evidence and estimate the loss based on that evidence.\" <i>Id.</i> In the instant case, we believe that the district court's determination that vendors were included within the definition of \"victim\" was correct, and also that the record adequately supports the two-level increase for more than 10 victims.</p>\n<p>As described <i>supra,</i> the government first argued that only financial institutions could suffer losses under § 2B1.1(b)(2)(A), and then amended their theory to also include vendors.

At the sentencing hearing, the defendant contended that this new interpretation was incorrect. We believe that the district court properly relied on both the testimony regarding the conversation with American Express and the Sentencing Guidelines explanatory notes, which defines \"victims\" for purposes of § 2B1.1(b)(2)(A) as including \"individuals, corporations, companies ...\" <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(2)(A), cmt. n. 1.

The government proffered that its agents had contacted 14 vendors who verified that they had suffered losses resulting from this fraud. In addition, the government provided a spreadsheet listing the amount of loss and specific vendors for fraudulent purchases made using American Express cards. The government then gave the information about the 14 vendors to defense counsel and the court. The defendant contends that because the government did not later rely on the same information at the restitution hearing, the district court should have disregarded this evidence at sentencing.</p>\n<p>We believe, however, that the government's factual determinationbased on the government's profferwas sufficient to support its enhancement under clear error review. The fact that the government did not later rely on the same 14 vendors at the restitution hearing does not necessarily cast doubt on the sentencing phase; rather, it appears that vendors may, for various reasons, have chosen not to submit the victim impact statements necessary to qualify for restitution. Similarly, we believe that the spreadsheet identifying the 14 vendors sufficiently connects their losses to Sharapka's fraudulent activities. Accordingly, the two-level enhancement was proper.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. The enhancement for possession of device-making equipment</h2>\n<p>The defendant also contends that the court's two-level enhancement for possession <span class=\"star-pagination\">*62</span> of \"device-making equipment\" resulted in impermissible double counting. <i>See</i> U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual § 2B1.1(b)(10)(A)(i) (2005). This enhancement stemmed from the discovery of a read/write scanning device at the defendant's home. According to Sharapka, the mandatory, consecutive sentence for aggravated identity theftpunishable under § 2B1.6 of the Guidelinesprecludes application of a two-level increase for specific offense characteristics under § 2B1.1(b)(10).</p>\n<p>Section § 2B1.6 compels the sentencing court to impose a consecutive punishment for identity theft counts punishable under 18 U.S.C. § 1028A (<i>i.e.,</i> counts eleven and twelve of the information to which Sharapka pled guilty). However, the commentary to the Guidelines states that \"if a sentence under this guideline is imposed in conjunction with a sentence for an underlying offense, do not apply any specific offense characteristic for the transfer, possession, or use of <i>a means of identification</i>...\" U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual § 2B1.6 (2005), cmt. n. 2 (emphasis added). This section therefore applies to certain enhancements under § 2B1.1(b)(10), but not to all. Section 2B1.1(b)(10) reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>If the offense involved (A) the <i>possession or use of any</i> (i) <i>device-making equipment,</i> or (ii) authentication feature; (B) the production or trafficking of any (i) unauthorized access device or counterfeit access device, or (ii) authentication feature; or (C)(i) the unauthorized transfer or use of any means of identification unlawfully to produce or obtain any other means of identification, or (ii) the possession of 5 or more means of identification that unlawfully were produced from, or obtained by the use of, another means of identification, increase by 2 levels.</blockquote>\n<p>(emphasis added). The defendant argues that because § 2B1.1(b)(10)(C)(i) includes the language \"transfer\" and \"possession,\" the prohibition under note 2 of § 2B1.6 operates to bar application of any enhancement. The government responds by arguing that the enhancement in this case resulted solely from \"the possession or use of device-making\" equipment, which makes § 2B1.6 inapplicable.</p>\n<p>We believe that the plain language supports the government's argument. § 2B1.1(b)(10) lists different offense characteristics, separated by the conjunction \"or,\" whose presence may justify a two-level enhancement. Had the court imposed the enhancement under § 2B1.1(b)(10)(C)(i), then § 2B1.6 would preclude application of a two-level enhancement. In Sharapka's case, however, the court imposed its enhancement after finding that the defendant possessed \"device-making equipment\"to wit, a read/write device. This finding implicates § 2B1.1(b)(10)(A)(i) and not § 2B1.1(b)(10)(C)(i); the two are different offense characteristics. Because § 2B1.6 does not cover possession of device-making equipment, the court acted appropriately in applying both the mandatory minimum under § 2B1.6 and the two-level enhancement under § 2B1.1(b)(10)(A)(i). To hold otherwise would result in an expansion of the application of § 2B1.6 beyond the specific characteristics identified by the Guidelines in the explanatory text.</p>\n<p>We therefore affirm Sharapka's sentence.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The federal charges from Georgia were incorporated into the 13-count information in this case.</p>\n<p>[2]  Sharapka's scheme operated as follows: he would order merchandise online using the stolen credit cards, have the items sent to Mail Boxes Etc., arrange for someone to deliver the items to his house, and then ship them overseas (primarily to Russia).</p>\n<p>[3]  The government provided evidence that Sharapka had used 10 or more cards, but conceded that it lacked sufficient evidence to prove that Sharapka had used each of these cards.

The charges stemmed from the defendant's illegal activities in Georgia  a state that he had fled during pretrial custody<sup>[1]</sup>  and in Boston, Massachusetts. At the time of his arrest, Sharapka was found with approximately 315 stolen credit card numbers, \"ID kits,\" various other PIN and credit card numbers, and equipment valued at over $80,000.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>In this appeal, the defendant challenges his sentence on two grounds. First, he argues as a factual matter that the district court improperly determined that ten or more victims suffered financial losses due to his activities, a finding that increased his sentence by two levels. <i>See</i> U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\"Guidelines\") § 2B1.1(b)(2)(A) (2005). And second, he argues that the district court erred in imposing a two-level enhancement for possession of device-making equipment pursuant to § 2B1.1(b)(10)(A) of the Guidelines.

Sharapka's sentence</h2>\n<p>Because the defendant only challenges the sentence, and not the underlying conviction, we will only address the facts pertinent to the issues raised. At sentencing, the district court found a base offense level of seven under § 2B1.1(a)(1) of the Guidelines, and then added the following enhancements: (1) 14 levels for the stipulated loss ($400,000 to $1,000,000), (2) two levels for more than 10 but fewer than 50 victims, (3) two levels for receipt of stolen property, (4) three levels for the commission of an offense while on release, (5) two levels for possession of device-making equipment, and (6) two levels for managerial role in the offense. The court then deducted two levels for acceptance of responsibility. The resulting offense level of 30 corresponded to a Guidelines sentencing range of 97-121 months. In addition, there was a 24-month mandatory consecutive sentence for aggravated identity fraud, which, when added to the level 30 offense, resulted in a range of 121-145 months. <i>See</i> U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual § 2B1.6 (2005). The district court then sentenced Sharapka to the bottom of this range, 121 months.</p>\n<p>We review findings of fact at sentencing hearings for clear error and legal issues de novo. <i>United States v. Pacheco,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202771\"><a href=\"/opinion/202771/united-states-v-pacheco/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></a></span>, 44 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. The enhancement for more than 10 but fewer than 50 \"victims\"</h2>\n<p>At the first day of the sentencing hearing, a government agent testified that the issuing banks suffered direct financial losses as a result of Sharapka's credit card fraud. However, another agent later testified that he had been unable to quantify these values because banks purge credit card accounts that are the subject of fraud. The government maintained that the issuing bank, and not the credit card company, suffered the direct financial loss as a result of the fraudulent use.<sup>[3]</sup> After the second day of the sentencing trial, the district court indicated that it was still unsure as to whether there were, in fact, more than 10 victims who suffered a financial loss.</p>\n<p>On the third day of the sentencing hearing, the government introduced a proffer  based on its conversation with American Express  that the vendor, and not the card-issuing bank, actually suffered the financial losses due to Sharapka's activities. The government then provided a list of 14 vendors its agents had contacted and who had reported losses due to Sharapka's illegal purchases. Based on this newly introduced information, the district court imposed a two-level increase to the defendant's sentence. The defendant contends that the court erred by relying on this proffer; specifically, he argues that the proffer fails to link the alleged losses (<i>i.e.</i> items seized at Sharapka's apartment) and that the court's analysis of the document was insufficient. In addition, the defendant notes that the government was unable to confirm losses attributable to specific entities at a later restitution hearing.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*61</span> The United States Sentencing Guidelines permit a court to increase a criminal defendant's sentence by two levels if the offense involved \"10 or more victims.\" U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual § 2B1.1(b)(2)(A) (2005). To support such an enhancement, the sentencing judge must find that 10 or more victims suffered actual loss by a preponderance of the evidence. <i>United States v. Leahy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202599\"><a href=\"/opinion/202599/united-states-v-leahy/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">401</span></a></span>, 413 (1st Cir.2007). The Guidelines define \"actual loss\" as the \"reasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm that resulted from the offense.\" U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual § 2B1.1 (2005), cmt. n. 3. The same explanatory note indicates that deference is owed to a sentencing judge's determination of the loss: \"The court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss. The sentencing judge is in a unique position to assess the evidence and estimate the loss based on that evidence.\" <i>Id.</i> In the instant case, we believe that the district court's determination that vendors were included within the definition of \"victim\" was correct, and also that the record adequately supports the two-level increase for more than 10 victims.</p>\n<p>As described <i>supra,</i> the government first argued that only financial institutions could suffer losses under § 2B1.1(b)(2)(A), and then amended their theory to also include vendors. This change resulted from an agent's discussion with American Express in which the government learned that banks suffer losses caused by fraudulent ATM use, while vendors incur losses resulting from fraudulent credit card use. At the sentencing hearing, the defendant contended that this new interpretation was incorrect. We believe that the district court properly relied on both the testimony regarding the conversation with American Express and the Sentencing Guidelines explanatory notes, which defines \"victims\" for purposes of § 2B1.1(b)(2)(A) as including \"individuals, corporations, companies ...\" <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(2)(A), cmt. n. 1.

In addition, the government provided a spreadsheet listing the amount of loss and specific vendors for fraudulent purchases made using American Express cards.

Accordingly, the two-level enhancement was proper.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. The enhancement for possession of device-making equipment</h2>\n<p>The defendant also contends that the court's two-level enhancement for possession <span class=\"star-pagination\">*62</span> of \"device-making equipment\" resulted in impermissible double counting. <i>See</i> U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual § 2B1.1(b)(10)(A)(i) (2005).
