José Antonio Fusté, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                Lynch and Howard, Circuit Judges,\n                      and Restani,* Judge.\n\n\n     Jorge L.

Garcia, United States Attorney, Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant\nUnited States Attorney, Senior Appellate Attorney, and Thomas F.\nKlumper, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                         April 14, 2006\n\n\n\n\n*Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of International Trade, sitting by\ndesignation.\n\f           HOWARD, Circuit Judge.     Defendant José Pérez-González\n\nappeals his convictions arising from his violent and destructive\n\nconduct at the former U.S. Naval base at Vieques, Puerto Rico.   We\n\naffirm.\n\n                                 I.\n\n           We present the facts in the light most favorable to the\n\nverdict,   see United States v. Boulerice, 325 F.3d 75, 79 (1st Cir.\n\n2003), reserving a discussion of some facts for our analysis.\n\n           The U.S. Navy intended to end its presence in Vieques by\n\ntransferring the lands making up its base to the U.S. Fish and\n\nWildlife Service (\"USFWS\") on May 1, 2003.       Just prior to the\n\ntransfer, the Navy provided the USFWS with several vehicles and\n\nother equipment previously used on the base.   Most of the vehicles\n\nand equipment were enclosed in a fenced motor pool area within a\n\nthirty-five acre compound known as \"Camp Garcia.\"   Camp Garcia was\n\napproximately one and a half miles from the base's main entrance.\n\n           On the night of April 30, 2003, a large crowd gathered\n\noutside the base's main gate to celebrate.       The crowd included\n\npolitical figures, members of the media, and law enforcement\n\nofficials on hand to keep the peace.    But what began as a peaceful\n\nrally quickly turned into a riot.\n\n           Shortly before midnight, a large group armed with wire\n\ncutters and sledgehammers broke down a section of fencing and\n\nentered the base.      Nearly simultaneously, others entered (or\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fattempted to enter) the base at other points.            Several of these\n\nintruders converged on Camp Garcia, broke down the fence, and\n\ncommandeered and vandalized vehicles and equipment.            With news\n\ncameras capturing the action, the rioters vandalized or destroyed\n\na number of government vehicles, equipment and buildings.              Most\n\nsignificantly for present purposes, they burned a Boston Whaler\n\nboat and a Humvee, and demolished the guard post at the main gate.\n\nImages and accounts of the riot were widely broadcast in Puerto\n\nRico and formed the basis for public debate.\n\n          Law     enforcement   officials   reviewed     photographs    and\n\nvideotapes   of    the   incident   and   managed   to    isolate   twelve\n\nsignificant participants, eleven of whom they could identify by\n\nname.   A grand jury returned a six-count indictment against the\n\ntwelve individuals (including the unidentified \"John Doe\" defendant\n\nwho later proved to be Pérez-González) for conspiracy, damaging\n\ngovernment property, and damaging government property by fire or\n\nexplosive.   Four counts named the John Doe defendant: a count\n\ncharging conspiracy to damage government property and to damage\n\ngovernment property by fire or explosive, see 18 U.S.C. §§ 371,\n\n1361, & 844(f)(1) (Count I); a count charging aiding and abetting\n\nthe destruction of the Humvee by means of fire, see 18 U.S.C. §\n\n844(f)(1)(Count III); a count charging the destruction of the\n\nconcrete entrance gate with damages exceeding $1000, see 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1361 (Count IV); and a count charging the destruction of the\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fHumvee with damages exceeding $1000, see 18 U.S.C. § 1361 (Count\n\nVI).    An arrest warrant issued for the John Doe defendant.               The\n\nwarrant    included     the     description      \"Male,    White    Hispanic,\n\nApproximately 5 Feet 9 Inches and 210 Pounds\" and was accompanied\n\nby a photograph of Pérez-González standing on a Humvee with a\n\nsledgehammer.    The photo was provided to the news media and widely\n\npublicized.     After seeing it, Pérez-González went to the FBI and\n\nidentified himself as both the \"John Doe\" defendant named in the\n\nindictment and the person in the photo.\n\n            Shortly    before   the     scheduled   trial,   all    of   Pérez-\n\nGonzález's     co-defendants     pled    guilty.     After   Pérez-González\n\nunsuccessfully moved for a continuance or a change of venue, he was\n\ntried alone.    At the voir dire, the district court questioned the\n\npotential jurors about their exposure to news stories about the\n\nriot and whether they could be impartial.           While most had seen or\n\nread about the incident, only ten of the seventy-five potential\n\njury candidates were excused because they could not be impartial.\n\n            At trial, the government called law enforcement officers\n\nwho were at the demonstration or involved in the investigation,\n\ngovernment officials involved in the transfer of property between\n\nthe Navy and the USFWS, and FBI Agent Amado Vega, the primary\n\ninvestigator.     The government also introduced videotapes of the\n\ndemonstration, photographs of the demonstration (some derived from\n\nthe    videotapes)    and   aftermath,    and   various   other    documentary\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fevidence.     The videotapes were particularly striking, as they\n\nshowed   Pérez-González   smashing   a   Humvee   with   a   sledgehammer,\n\nscuffling with police, and repeatedly crashing a government water\n\ntruck into the guard post until it collapsed.                Pérez-González\n\npresented no evidence and did not take the stand.                 The jury\n\nconvicted him on all counts, and the district court sentenced him\n\nto concurrent terms of sixty months on Count I and fifty-one months\n\non Counts III, IV, and VI.\n\n                                  II.\n\n            Pérez-González first argues1 that his arrest warrant was\n\nillegal because it was a constitutionally inadequate \"John Doe\"\n\nwarrant.    See United States v. John Doe, 703 F.2d 745 (3d Cir.\n\n1983)    (warrant   describing   subject   only    as    \"John   Doe\"   was\n\nconstitutionally insufficient).      He also argues that, because of\n\nthe inadequate warrant and the further failure to provide him with\n\nMiranda warnings after he turned himself in, his post-arrest\n\nstatements identifying himself as the man in the photo should have\n\nbeen suppressed.\n\n            Pérez-González first raised these issues in the district\n\ncourt by means of a motion to suppress filed on the first day of\n\ntrial.     The district court denied the motion as to the arrest\n\n\n\n1\n The government questions whether Pérez-González preserved all\nissues for plenary appellate review, but opines that they fail on\nthe merits in any event. Except where we note otherwise, we will\npresume that Pérez-González's contentions were preserved.\n\n                                  -5-\n\fwarrant, but held a hearing mid-trial regarding the post-arrest\n\nstatements.      The court then concluded that the statements were\n\nvoluntary.\n\n             By waiting until the first day of trial to challenge the\n\nwarrant and statements, Pérez-González has forfeited these issues.\n\nSee Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(e);2 see also United States v. Lopez-Lopez,\n\n282 F.3d 1, 9-10 (1st Cir. 2002); United States v. Bashorun, 225\n\nF.3d 9, 13-17 (1st Cir. 2000).     A court may grant relief from the\n\nforfeiture if a party establishes cause for its failure to file a\n\ntimely motion to suppress, see Lopez-Lopez, 282 F.3d at 10, but\n\nPérez-González does not even attempt to do so.\n\n             \"The question whether an appellate court may review for\n\nplain error despite a [Rule 12(e)] waiver, provided that the record\n\nenables review, is open in this circuit.\"      Id. at 10 n.4.   But even\n\nif we assume the power to correct a plain error in circumstances\n\nsuch as these, we would not do so here.   The challenged warrant was\n\nnever formally executed, as Pérez-González voluntarily surrendered\n\nto authorities. Further, Agent Vega testified that the warrant was\n\naccompanied by a photo, a significant factor in assessing its\n\nadequacy. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 4(b)(1)(A) (a warrant must \"contain\n\nthe defendant's name or, if it is unknown, a name or description by\n\nwhich the defendant can be identified with reasonable certainty\").3\n\n\n2\n    Rule 12(f) prior to the 2002 amendments.\n3\n    Indeed, Pérez-González identified himself from the photo.\n\n                                  -6-\n\fAnd Pérez-González has presented us with no reason to question the\n\ndistrict court's conclusion that the statements were voluntary.\n\nCf. United States v. McLean, 409 F.3d 492, 498-99 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(defendant's   statements   made   in    his   offer   to   cooperate   held\n\nvoluntary).\n\n          Pérez-González next argues that his convictions under\n\nCounts III and VI violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. He maintains\n\nthat he is being improperly punished twice for the same offense\n\nbecause 18 U.S.C. § 1361, the subject of Count VI, is a lesser\n\nincluded offense of 18 U.S.C. § 844(f)(1), the subject of Count\n\nIII.\n\n          The Double Jeopardy Clause protects against multiple\n\npunishments for the same offense unless the legislature clearly\n\nintended to impose multiple punishments for the offense.              United\n\nStates v. Patel, 370 F.3d 108, 114 (1st Cir. 2004).                 Thus, to\n\ndetermine whether multiple punishments are authorized, we must\n\nfirst seek to determine the legislature's intent.             Id.    If the\n\nlegislature's intent is unclear, we apply the Blockburger test, see\n\nBlockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299 (1932), as a \"default\n\nrule of statutory construction.\"        Patel, 370 F.3d at 114.       \"Under\n\nBlockburger, . . . the test . . . is whether each [statute]\n\nrequires proof of an additional fact which the other does not.\"\n\nId. (internal citation and quotation omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\f             Pérez-González asserts that the legislative intent with\n\nregard to the joint application of the two statutes is ambiguous\n\nand proceeds to a Blockburger analysis.         We accept arguendo that\n\nBlockburger applies, but a review of the relevant statutes dooms\n\nhis     argument.   While   both   provisions   clearly   pertain   to   the\n\ndamaging of government property,4         Section 844(f) includes the\n\nadditional element of the use of fire or explosives and Section\n\n1361 includes the additional element of a minimum monetary damage\n\n\n\n\n4\n    Section 1361 provides, in relevant portion:\n\n        Whoever willfully injures or commits any depredation\n        against any property of the United States, or of any\n        department or agency thereof, . . ., or attempts to\n        commit any of the foregoing offenses, shall be punished\n        as follows:\n        If the damage or attempted damage to such property\n        exceeds the sum of $1,000, by fine under this title or\n        imprisonment for not more than ten years, or both; if the\n        damage or attempted damage to such property does not\n        exceed the sum of $1,000, by a fine under this title or\n        by imprisonment for not more than one year, or both.\n\n        Section 844(f)(1) states:\n\n        Whoever maliciously damages or destroys, or attempts to\n        damage or destroy, by means of fire or an explosive, any\n        building, vehicle, or other personal or real property in\n        whole or in part owned or possessed by, or leased to, the\n        United States, or any department or agency thereof, or\n        any institution or organization receiving Federal\n        financial assistance, shall be imprisoned for not less\n        than five years and not more than 20 years, fined under\n        this title, or both.\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\famount (to be charged as a felony5), distinctions that Pérez-\n\nGonzalez's counsel conceded at oral argument.          The offenses are\n\ndistinct under Blockburger.      See Patel, 370 F.3d at 114.6\n\n            Pérez-González next maintains that he was entitled to a\n\ncontinuance of the trial or a change of venue due to pretrial\n\npublicity.   He asserts that media coverage was so intense, biased,\n\nand inflammatory -- the media mentioned him by name and directly\n\ncommented on the evidence against him -- that it was difficult to\n\ndraw an impartial jury.     He also argues that the district court\n\ncommitted reversible error in failing to voir dire each prospective\n\njuror outside the presence of the others.\n\n            Motions for continuances are reviewed for manifest abuse\n\nof discretion, see United States v. Orlando-Figueroa, 229 F.3d 33,\n\n39 (1st Cir. 2000), and motions for a change of venue are reviewed\n\nfor abuse of discretion, see United States v. Rodriguez-Cardona,\n\n924 F.2d 1148, 1158 (1st Cir. 1991).        In assessing the need for a\n\nchange of venue or a continuance based on pretrial publicity, \"the\n\ncourt must determine if prejudice exists from the publicity.\"\n\nOrlando-Figueroa,   229   F.3d   at   42.    \"The   test   for   prejudice\n\n\n\n5\n We do not address whether a conviction for a misdemeanor Section\n1361 violation would raise double jeopardy concerns if paired with\na conviction under Section 844(f)(1).\n6\n As noted   by the government, the two counts are also directed to\ndifferent   conduct: Count III was directed to the burning of the\nvehicle,    while Count VI was directed to the initial damage\ninflicted   on the vehicle with sledgehammers and wire cutters.\n\n                                   -9-\n\fsufficient to justify a change of venue is whether (a) the facts\n\nshow that jury prejudice should be presumed, and (b) if prejudice\n\nshould not be presumed, whether the jury was actually prejudiced\n\nagainst   the   defendant.\"      Rodriguez-Cardona,    924   F.2d     at   1158.\n\n\"Prejudice may be presumed where inflammatory publicity has so\n\nsaturated   a   community   as    to   render   it   difficult   to    draw   an\n\nimpartial jury or where enough jurors admit to prejudice to cause\n\nconcern as to any avowals of impartiality by the other jurors.\"\n\nOrlando-Figueroa, 229 F.3d at 43.               But mere exposure of the\n\npotential jury pool to news reports regarding the crime does not,\n\nin and of itself, result in an inability to select an impartial\n\njury.   See generally United States v. Medina, 761 F.2d 12, 19 (1st\n\nCir. 1985); United States v. Drougas, 748 F.2d 8, 29 (1st Cir.\n\n1984) (\"Extensive knowledge in the community of either the crimes\n\nor the defendants is not sufficient, by itself, to render a trial\n\nconstitutionally unfair.\").\n\n            There is nothing in the record -- no statements by jurors\n\nindicating animus, no examples of inflammatory newspaper articles\n\nor prejudicial news reports,7 and no evidence whatsoever of the\n\npervasiveness or tone of the media coverage -- to substantiate\n\nPérez-González's argument.        And with regard to the voir dire, only\n\n\n7\n The government contends that the three articles that Pérez-\nGonzález attached to his motion to continue did not mention him and\nwere objective rather than inflammatory. We concur as to the one\narticle in English, but cannot tell as to the other two because\nPérez-González has failed to provide us with translations.\n\n                                       -10-\n\ften of seventy-five potential jurors (less than 14%) stated that\n\nthey could not be impartial, and the district court promptly\n\nexcluded them.      This is far too few potential jurors indicating\n\nbias to warrant any presumption of prejudice. See United States v.\n\nMoreno Morales, 815 F.2d 725, 734-36 (1st Cir. 1987) (that 25% of\n\npotential    jurors     believed    defendant   guilty    not    sufficient).\n\nMoreover, the district court repeatedly reminded the jurors to keep\n\nan open mind and to avoid media reports or other sources of\n\ninformation about the case.\n\n            Pérez-González also maintains that the district court\n\nerred in questioning potential jurors about bias as a group rather\n\nthan individually out of the presence of the others.                 However, he\n\nfailed to raise this argument in the district court.                 But even if\n\nhe had, the court's procedure would not constitute reversible\n\nerror.      While     we   have    endorsed   the   concept     of    individual\n\nquestioning in high profile cases, see Medina, 761 F.2d at 20, we\n\nhave approved \"group\" questioning of potential jurors about bias as\n\nwithin the district court's broad discretion in conducting voir\n\ndire, see Orlando-Figueroa, 229 F.3d at 43.8             Pérez-González has\n\n\n\n\n8\n We note as well that this is not a case where juror partiality\nwould have inevitably worked against Pérez-González. The Vieques\nissue is a complicated one, fostering much civil disobedience, see,\ne.g., United States v. Ayala, 289 F.3d 16 (1st Cir. 2002); United\nStates v. Ventura-Melendez, 275 F.3d 9 (1st Cir. 2001), and there\nmight well have been potential jurors predisposed to be sympathetic\nto Pérez-González.\n\n                                      -11-\n\fpresented no basis for questioning the appropriateness of the\n\ndistrict court's voir dire procedure in this case.\n\n            Pérez-González next asserts that the videotapes should\n\nnot have been admitted because they were improperly authenticated,\n\nmisleadingly edited, misleadingly presented, and unduly prejudicial\n\nwithin the meaning of Fed. R. Evid. 403.              We review a district\n\ncourt's    decision    to   admit   or   exclude   evidence    for   abuse      of\n\ndiscretion.    See United States v. Perez-Ruiz, 353 F.3d 1, 10 (1st\n\nCir. 2003).    As to prejudice, \"[t]rial judges enjoy wide latitude\n\nin making Rule 403 rulings and are only overturned after a showing\n\nof egregious error.\"        United States v. Kornegay, 410 F.3d 89, 96\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).      As to authentication, \"Federal Rule of Evidence\n\n901(a)    requires    the   trial   court   to   determine    if   there   is    a\n\nreasonable probability that the evidence is what it is purported to\n\nbe.\"     United States v. Carlos Cruz, 352 F.3d 499, 506 (1st Cir.\n\n2003) (internal citation and quotation omitted); see also United\n\nStates v. Alicea-Cardoza, 132 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1997)(\"[I]f the\n\ndistrict court is satisfied that the evidence is sufficient to\n\nallow a reasonable person to believe the evidence is what it\n\npurports to be, Rule 901(a) is satisfied and the jury may decide\n\nwhat weight it will give the evidence.\").\n\n            The district court's admission of the videotapes was\n\nwithin its broad discretion. The news photographers were called as\n\nwitnesses and authenticated the videotapes, and Pérez-González\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fcross-examined them about their editing procedures. He provides no\n\ninkling why this was inadequate.           Pérez-González's claims about\n\nmisleading and prejudicial presentation -- an alleged \"slowing up\"\n\nof the tape and the inclusion of inflammatory audio commentary --\n\nare simply not supported by the record (and would not constitute\n\nreversible error if they were).         The videotapes were also highly\n\nrelevant,    as   they   showed   the   offense      as   it   occurred   and\n\ncorroborated many aspects of the government witnesses' testimony.\n\nFinally, they were prejudicial only in the sense that they were\n\ndamaging.   This is not \"prejudice\" within the meaning of Rule 403.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. O'Shea, 426 F.3d 475, 485 (1st Cir.\n\n2005); see also United States v. Curtis, 344 F.3d 1057, 1067-68\n\n(10th Cir. 2003).\n\n            Pérez-González   next    argues   that    certain    photographs\n\nadmitted into evidence did not accurately depict the objects\n\nphotographed at the relevant time, included \"visual elements\" that\n\nwere irrelevant and prejudicial, and should have been excluded\n\nunder Fed. R. Evid. 401, 402, and 403.\n\n            Pérez-González first challenges the admission of exhibit\n\n57a -- which shows a masked individual in front of a damaged Humvee\n\nwith its front seat on fire -- on the ground that there is no\n\nindication when the photograph was taken or that any of the\n\nperpetrators wore masks. But the photograph is clearly relevant to\n\nCount III (which involved the initial burning of the Humvee) and\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\fcorroborates the testimony of government witnesses that several\n\nrioters wore masks.\n\n           Pérez-González also challenges exhibit 16 (four news\n\nphotos on one page) on the ground of \"blurriness,\" and exhibits 56-\n\n60 (news photos) on the ground that they include commentary and\n\nopinion.    The   former    characterization   is   inaccurate,    as   the\n\npictures are sufficiently clear, and the latter is specious, as the\n\nphotos do not have captions or any accompanying text.\n\n           Finally, Pérez-González makes a generalized \"global\"\n\nchallenge to exhibits 17-51. Again here, his argument is baseless.\n\nAll the photos were relevant, properly authenticated, accurately\n\ndepicted the damage done, and corroborated the testimony of the\n\ngovernment witnesses.9\n\n           Pérez-González      next   posits    that     his      in-court\n\nidentification by various law enforcement officials, who lacked an\n\nadequate opportunity to observe him during the riot, should have\n\nbeen disallowed because the procedure employed was improperly\n\nsuggestive and likely to yield a misidentification. He also argues\n\nthat the trial court should have permitted him to sit in the\n\ngallery and ordered an in-court line-up.\n\n           In evaluating an identification, the court looks first to\n\nwhether an inappropriately suggestive procedure was employed.           See\n\n\n9\n To the extent Pérez-González seeks to challenge other photographic\nevidence, he has done so too casually to merit further discussion.\nSee United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n                                  -14-\n\fUnited States v. Henderson, 320 F.3d 92, 100 (1st Cir. 2003).    If\n\nso, the court must \"decide whether the identification itself was\n\nreliable under the totality of the circumstances, notwithstanding\n\nthe suggestive procedure.\"    Id. (internal citation and quotation\n\nomitted).    Exclusion of (or prohibition of) an identification is\n\nonly appropriate if the court believes there is a very substantial\n\nlikelihood of irreparable misidentification. Id.; see also United\n\nStates v. Jesus-Rios, 990 F.2d 672, 677 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"[I]t is\n\nonly in extraordinary cases that identification evidence should be\n\nwithheld from the jury.\")(internal quotation and citation omitted).\n\n            The district court acted well within its discretion in\n\npermitting the jury to consider the identification evidence.    All\n\nthe identifying officers saw videotapes and photographs of Pérez-\n\nGonzález before trial.   Indeed, because law enforcement officials\n\nwere intently reviewing those materials in an attempt to identify\n\nthe perpetrators, a careful review of the visual evidence was an\n\nessential step in the investigation.     This is not a situation\n\ninvolving a dubious photo array or a one-person show-up.        See,\n\ne.g., Jesus-Rios, 990 F.2d at 677-78.       Further, there is no\n\nentitlement to an in-court line-up or other particular procedure.\n\nSee Curtis, 344 F.3d at 1063.   And in any event, the argument has\n\na bit of a surreal quality to it because Pérez-González admitted\n\nthat he was the individual in the photograph which accompanied the\n\n\n\n\n                                -15-\n\findictment and which was generated from the videotape of the riot\n\nthat the officers reviewed.\n\n             Pérez-González next challenges the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence     establishing    the    conspiracy         and   the   value    of     the\n\ngovernment property destroyed.10 \"We will affirm the conviction if,\n\nafter assaying all the evidence in the light most amiable to the\n\ngovernment, and taking all reasonable inferences in its favor, a\n\nrational factfinder could find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the\n\nprosecution successfully proved the essential elements of the\n\ncrime.\" Boulerice, 325 F.3d at 79 (internal citation and quotation\n\nomitted).     The government need not succeed in \"eliminating every\n\npossible theory consistent with the defendant's innocence,\" and\n\n\"[w]e will affirm if any rational trier of fact could have found\n\nthe essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n\nId. (internal citation and quotation omitted).\n\n             In challenging his conspiracy conviction,             Pérez-González\n\nemphasizes     that   mere   presence       or   similar      actions      to    other\n\nindividuals is insufficient to show membership in a conspiracy. He\n\npoints out that there was no evidence of communication by cell\n\nphone   or   walkie-talkies,       and    that   the    incident    can     only    be\n\n\n\n\n10\n In his brief, Pérez-González has not challenged his conviction\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 844(f)(1) for aiding and abetting the destruction\nof the Humvee by fire. He has thus waived the claim.\n\n\n                                         -16-\n\fconsidered a riot and not the result of an organized criminal\n\nendeavor.\n\n                   To prove the elements of the crime of\n            conspiracy, the government must show the\n            existence of a conspiracy, the defendant's\n            knowledge   of   the   conspiracy,   and   the\n            defendant's voluntary participation in the\n            conspiracy. More specifically, to establish\n            that a defendant belonged to and participated\n            in a conspiracy, the government must prove two\n            kinds of intent: intent to agree [with his co-\n            conspirators] and intent to commit the\n            substantive offense. Such proof may consist\n            of circumstantial evidence, such as acts\n            committed by the defendant that furthered the\n            conspiracy's purposes.\n\nUnited States v. Llinas, 373 F.3d 26, 30 (1st Cir. 2004) (internal\n\ncitation and quotation omitted).             The agreement \"need not be\n\nexpress, but may consist of no more than a tacit understanding.\"\n\nUnited States v. Echeverri, 982 F.2d 675, 679 (1st Cir. 1993)\n\n(internal citation and quotation omitted).           \"[E]ach coconspirator\n\nneed not know of or have contact with all other members, nor must\n\nthey know all of the details of the conspiracy or participate in\n\nevery act in furtherance of it.\" United States v. Martinez-Medina,\n\n279 F.3d 105, 113 (1st Cir. 2002).           However, mere presence at the\n\nscene or simple association with the conspirators will not suffice\n\nto establish guilt.     Llinas, 373 F.3d at 32.\n\n            There was sufficient evidence to support the conspiracy\n\nconviction.     Various co-defendants came to the event armed with\n\nsledgehammers    and   wire   cutters   --    odd   things    to   bring   to   a\n\ncelebration unless one was planning mischief.                In addition, the\n\n                                   -17-\n\fattack appeared coordinated, with participants spilling on to the\n\nbase at multiple entry points and nearly simultaneously. Moreover,\n\nthe perpetrators covered the mile and a half from the main gate to\n\nCamp Garcia and the motor pool in about twenty minutes, which is\n\nsuggestive of a planned assault.               And if the evidence of a\n\nconspiracy is sufficient, there can be no doubt that the jury\n\nreasonably found Pérez-González to be a conspirator.           He is shown\n\non videotape smashing the Humvee with a sledgehammer, scuffling\n\nwith police, and driving a water truck into the main gate until it\n\ncollapsed.11     While the jury conceivably could have reached a\n\ndifferent conclusion, that does not suffice to undermine the\n\nverdict.   See Echeverri, 982 F.2d at 678(\"we require only that a\n\njury's verdict be supportable, not that it be inevitable\"); United\n\nStates v. Batista-Polanco, 927 F.2d 14, 17 (1st Cir. 1991)(\"the\n\nfactfinder may decide among reasonable interpretations of the\n\nevidence\").\n\n           Pérez-González next argues that the government failed to\n\nprove that the destroyed Humvee and main gate were valued at over\n\n$1,000   each.    He   asserts   that    the    government's   own   records\n\nestablish that the Humvee was transferred from the Navy to the\n\n\n\n\n11\n Significantly, several individuals rode along with Pérez-González\nin the water truck and helped him escape arrest by grabbing the\nwould-be arresting officer around the neck. A rational jury could\nconclude that confederates, rather than mere bystanders, were\ninvolved with Pérez-González in these dangerous activities.\n\n                                  -18-\n\fUSFWS at a value of $0, and that the main gate only cost $450 to\n\nbuild.\n\n          These arguments are frivolous.     The government called\n\nwitnesses who testified that the Humvee was only valued at $0 for\n\npurposes of the transfer because two federal entities (as opposed\n\nto an outside purchaser) were involved.    Moreover, the government\n\npresented evidence that the replacement cost and residual value of\n\nthe Humvee far exceeded $1000.    And, while the gate may have only\n\ncost $450 to construct, it was constructed over forty years ago.\n\nIts current value (or replacement cost) was supportably pegged at\n\nmore than $40,000.\n\n          Finally, Pérez-González challenges the jury instructions\n\nregarding the conspiracy charge and the value of the government\n\nproperty destroyed.   But he has not explained what was wrong with\n\nthe conspiracy charge, and his attack on the instructions is both\n\ninadequately elaborated and, so far as we can tell, based upon the\n\nspecious suggestion that the jury could have found the property\n\ndestroyed to be worth less than $1000.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\f",

Boulerice,</i> 325 F.3d 75, 79 (1st Cir.2003), reserving a discussion of some facts for our analysis. The U.S. Navy intended to end its presence in Vieques by transferring the lands making up its base to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (\"USFWS\") on May 1, 2003. Just prior to the transfer, the Navy provided the USFWS with several vehicles and other equipment previously used on the base. Most of the vehicles and equipment were enclosed in a fenced motor pool area within a thirty-five acre compound known as \"Camp Garcia.\" Camp Garcia was approximately one and a half miles from the base's main entrance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the night of April 30, 2003, a large crowd gathered outside the base's main gate to celebrate. The crowd included political figures, members of the media, and law enforcement officials on hand to keep the peace. But what began as a peaceful rally quickly turned into a riot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly before midnight, a large group armed with wire cutters and sledgehammers broke down a section of fencing and entered the base. Nearly simultaneously, others entered (or attempted to enter) the base at other points. Several of these intruders converged on Camp Garcia, broke down the fence, and commandeered and vandalized vehicles and equipment. With news cameras capturing the action, the rioters vandalized or destroyed a number of government vehicles, equipment and buildings. Most significantly for present purposes, they burned a Boston Whaler boat and a Humvee, and demolished the guard post at the main gate. Images and accounts of the riot were widely broadcast in Puerto Rico and formed the basis for public debate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Law enforcement officials reviewed photographs and videotapes of the incident and managed to isolate twelve significant participants, eleven of whom they could identify by name. A grand jury returned a six-count indictment against the twelve individuals (including the unidentified \"John Doe\" defendant who later proved to be P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez) for conspiracy, damaging government property, and damaging government property by fire or explosive. Four counts named the John Doe defendant: a count charging conspiracy to damage government property and to damage government property by fire or explosive, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 371, 1361, &amp; 844(f)(1) (Count I); a count charging aiding and abetting the destruction of the Humvee by means of fire, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(f)(1)(Count III); a count charging the destruction of the concrete entrance gate with damages exceeding $1000, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1361 (Count IV); and a count charging the destruction of the Humvee with damages exceeding $1000, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1361 (Count VI). An arrest warrant issued for the John Doe defendant. The warrant included the description \"Male, White Hispanic, Approximately 5 Feet 9 Inches and 210 Pounds\" and was accompanied by a photograph of P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez standing on a Humvee with a sledgehammer. The photo was provided to the news media and widely publicized. After seeing it, P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez went to the FBI and identified himself as both the \"John Doe\" defendant named in the indictment and the person in the photo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly before the scheduled trial, all of P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez's co-defendants pled guilty. After P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez unsuccessfully moved for a continuance or a change of venue, he was tried alone. At the voir dire, the district court questioned the potential jurors about their exposure to news stories about the riot and whether they could be impartial. While most had seen or read about the incident, only ten of the seventy-five potential jury candidates were excused because they could not be impartial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the government called law enforcement officers who were at the demonstration or involved in the investigation, government officials involved in the transfer of property between the Navy and the USFWS, and FBI Agent Amado Vega, the primary investigator. The government also introduced videotapes of the demonstration, photographs of the demonstration (some derived from the videotapes) and aftermath, and various other documentary evidence. The videotapes were particularly striking, as they showed P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez smashing a Humvee with a sledgehammer, scuffling with police, and repeatedly crashing a government water truck into the guard post until it collapsed. P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez presented no evidence and did not take the stand. The jury convicted him on all counts, and the district court sentenced him to concurrent terms of sixty months on Count I and fifty-one months on Counts III, IV, and VI.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez first argues<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> that his arrest warrant was illegal because it was a constitutionally inadequate \"John Doe\" warrant. <i>See United States v. John Doe,</i> 703 F.2d 745 (3d Cir.1983) (warrant describing subject only as \"John Doe\" was constitutionally insufficient). He also argues that, because of the inadequate warrant and the further failure to provide him with <i>Miranda</i> warnings after he turned himself in, his post-arrest statements identifying himself as the man in the photo should have been suppressed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez first raised these issues in the district court by means of a motion to suppress filed on the first day of trial. The district court denied the motion as to the arrest warrant, but held a hearing mid-trial regarding the post-arrest statements. The court then concluded that the statements were voluntary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By waiting until the first day of trial to challenge the warrant and statements, P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez has forfeited these issues. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(e);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>see also United States v. Lopez-Lopez,</i> 282 F.3d 1, 9-10 (1st Cir.2002); <i>United States v. Bashorun,</i> 225 F.3d 9, 13-17 (1st Cir.2000). A court may grant relief from the forfeiture if a party establishes cause for its failure to file a timely motion to suppress, <i>see Lopez-Lopez,</i> 282 F.3d at 10, but P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez does not even attempt to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The question whether an appellate court may review for plain error despite a [Rule 12(e)] waiver, provided that the record enables review, is open in this circuit.\" <i>Id.</i> at 10 n. 4. But even if we assume the power to correct a plain error in circumstances such as these, we would not do so here. The challenged warrant was never formally executed, as P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez voluntarily surrendered to authorities. Further, Agent Vega testified that the warrant was accompanied by a photo, a significant factor in assessing its adequacy. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Crim.P. 4(b)(1)(A) (a warrant must \"contain the defendant's name or, if it is unknown, a name or description by which the defendant can be identified with reasonable certainty\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> And P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez has presented us with no reason to question the district court's conclusion that the statements were voluntary. <i>Cf. United States v. McLean,</i> 409 F.3d 492, 498-99 (1st Cir.2005) (defendant's statements made in his offer to cooperate held voluntary).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez next argues that his convictions under Counts III and VI violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. He maintains that he is being improperly punished twice for the same offense because 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1361, the subject of Count VI, is a lesser included offense of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(f)(1), the subject of Count III.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Double Jeopardy Clause protects against multiple punishments for the same offense unless the legislature clearly intended to impose multiple punishments for the offense. <i>United States v. Patel,</i> 370 F.3d 108, 114 (1st Cir.2004). Thus, to determine whether multiple punishments are authorized, we must first seek to determine the legislature's intent. <i>Id.</i> If the legislature's intent is unclear, we apply the <i>Blockburger</i> test, <i>see Blockburger v. United States,</i> 284 U.S. 299, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932), as a \"default rule of statutory construction.\" <i>Patel,</i> 370 F.3d at 114. \"Under <i>Blockburger,</i> . . . the test. . . is whether each [statute] requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal citation and quotation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez asserts that the legislative intent with regard to the joint application of the two statutes is ambiguous and proceeds to a <i>Blockburger</i> analysis. We accept arguendo that <i>Blockburger</i> applies, but a review of the relevant statutes dooms his argument. While both provisions clearly pertain to the damaging of government property,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Section 844(f) includes the additional element of the use of fire or explosives and Section 1361 includes the additional element of a minimum monetary damage amount (to be charged as a felony<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>), distinctions that P&#233;rez-Gonzalez's counsel conceded at oral argument. The offenses are distinct under <i>Blockburger. See Patel,</i> 370 F.3d at 114.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez next maintains that he was entitled to a continuance of the trial or a change of venue due to pretrial publicity. He asserts that media coverage was so intense, biased, and inflammatory &#8212; the media mentioned him by name and directly commented on the evidence against him &#8212; that it was difficult to draw an impartial jury. He also argues that the district court committed reversible error in failing to voir dire each prospective juror outside the presence of the others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Motions for continuances are reviewed for manifest abuse of discretion, <i>see United States v. Orlando-Figueroa,</i> 229 F.3d 33, 39 (1st Cir.2000), and motions for a change of venue are reviewed for abuse of discretion, <i>see United States v. Rodriguez-Cardona,</i> 924 F.2d 1148, 1158 (1st Cir.1991). In assessing the need for a change of venue or a continuance based on pretrial publicity, \"the court must determine if prejudice exists from the publicity.\" <i>Orlando-Figueroa,</i> 229 F.3d at 42. \"The test for prejudice sufficient to justify a change of venue is whether (a) the facts show that jury prejudice should be presumed, and (b) if prejudice should not be presumed, whether the jury was actually prejudiced against the defendant.\" <i>Rodriguez-Cardona,</i> 924 F.2d at 1158. \"Prejudice may be presumed where inflammatory publicity has so saturated a community as to render it difficult to draw an impartial jury or where enough jurors admit to prejudice to cause concern as to any avowals of impartiality by the other jurors.\" <i>Orlando-Figueroa,</i> 229 F.3d at 43. But mere exposure of the potential jury pool to news reports regarding the crime does not, in and of itself, result in an inability to select an impartial jury. <i>See generally United States v. Medina,</i> 761 F.2d 12, 19 (1st Cir.1985); <i>United States v. Drougas,</i> 748 F.2d 8, 29 (1st Cir.1984) (\"Extensive knowledge in the community of either the crimes or the defendants is not sufficient, by itself, to render a trial constitutionally unfair.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is nothing in the record &#8212; no statements by jurors indicating animus, no examples of inflammatory newspaper articles or prejudicial news reports,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> and no evidence whatsoever of the pervasiveness or tone of the media coverage &#8212; to substantiate P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez's argument. And with regard to the voir dire, only ten of seventy-five potential jurors (less than 14%) stated that they could not be impartial, and the district court promptly excluded them. This is far too few potential jurors indicating bias to warrant any presumption of prejudice. <i>See United States v. Moreno Morales,</i> 815 F.2d 725, 734-36 (1st Cir.1987) (that 25% of potential jurors believed defendant guilty not sufficient). Moreover, the district court repeatedly reminded the jurors to keep an open mind and to avoid media reports or other sources of information about the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez also maintains that the district court erred in questioning potential jurors about bias as a group rather than individually out of the presence of the others. However, he failed to raise this argument in the district court. But even if he had, the court's procedure would not constitute reversible error. While we have endorsed the concept of individual questioning in high profile cases, <i>see Medina,</i> 761 F.2d at 20, we have approved \"group\" questioning of potential jurors about bias as within the district court's broad discretion in conducting voir dire, <i>see Orlando-Figueroa,</i> 229 F.3d at 43.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez has presented no basis for questioning the appropriateness of the district court's voir dire procedure in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez next asserts that the videotapes should not have been admitted because they were improperly authenticated, misleadingly edited, misleadingly presented, and unduly prejudicial within the meaning of Fed.R.Evid. 403. We review a district court's decision to admit or exclude evidence for abuse of discretion. <i>See United States v. Perez-Ruiz,</i> 353 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir.2003). As to prejudice, \"[t]rial judges enjoy wide latitude in making Rule 403 rulings and are only overturned after a showing of egregious error.\" <i>United States v. Kornegay,</i> 410 F.3d 89, 96 (1st Cir.2005). As to authentication, \"Federal Rule of Evidence 901(a) requires the trial court to determine if there is a reasonable probability that the evidence is what it is purported to be.\" <i>United States v. Carlos Cruz,</i> 352 F.3d 499, 506 (1st Cir.2003) (internal citation and quotation omitted); <i>see also United States v. Alicea-Cardoza,</i> 132 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1997)(\"[I]f the district court is satisfied that the evidence is sufficient to allow a reasonable person to believe the evidence is what it purports to be, Rule 901(a) is satisfied and the jury may decide what weight it will give the evidence.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's admission of the videotapes was within its broad discretion. The news photographers were called as witnesses and authenticated the videotapes, and P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez cross-examined them about their editing procedures. He provides no inkling why this was inadequate. P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez's claims about misleading and prejudicial presentation &#8212; an alleged \"slowing up\" of the tape and the inclusion of inflammatory audio commentary &#8212; are simply not supported by the record (and would not constitute reversible error if they were). The videotapes were also highly relevant, as they showed the offense as it occurred and corroborated many aspects of the government witnesses' testimony. Finally, they were prejudicial only in the sense that they were damaging. This is not \"prejudice\" within the meaning of Rule 403. <i>See, e.g., United States v. O'Shea,</i> 426 F.3d 475, 485 (1st Cir.2005); <i>see also United States v. Curtis,</i> 344 F.3d 1057, 1067-68 (10th Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez next argues that certain photographs admitted into evidence did not accurately depict the objects photographed at the relevant time, included \"visual elements\" that were irrelevant and prejudicial, and should have been excluded under Fed.R.Evid. 401, 402, and 403.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez first challenges the admission of exhibit 57a &#8212; which shows a masked individual in front of a damaged Humvee with its front seat on fire &#8212; on the ground that there is no indication when the photograph was taken or that any of the perpetrators wore masks. But the photograph is clearly relevant to Count III (which involved the initial burning of the Humvee) and corroborates the testimony of government witnesses that several rioters wore masks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez also challenges exhibit 16 (four news photos on one page) on the ground of \"blurriness,\" and exhibits 56-60 (news photos) on the ground that they include commentary and opinion. The former characterization is inaccurate, as the pictures are sufficiently clear, and the latter is specious, as the photos do not have captions or any accompanying text.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez makes a generalized \"global\" challenge to exhibits 17-51. Again here, his argument is baseless. All the photos were relevant, properly authenticated, accurately depicted the damage done, and corroborated the testimony of the government witnesses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez next posits that his in-court identification by various law enforcement officials, who lacked an adequate opportunity to observe him during the riot, should have been disallowed because the procedure employed was improperly suggestive and likely to yield a misidentification. He also argues that the trial court should have permitted him to sit in the gallery and ordered an in-court lineup.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In evaluating an identification, the court looks first to whether an inappropriately suggestive procedure was employed. <i>See United States v. Henderson,</i> 320 F.3d 92, 100 (1st Cir.2003). If so, the court must \"decide whether the identification itself was reliable under the totality of the circumstances, notwithstanding the suggestive procedure.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal citation and quotation omitted). Exclusion of (or prohibition of) an identification is only appropriate if the court believes there is a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification. <i>Id.; see also United States v. de Jesus-Rios,</i> 990 F.2d 672, 677 (1st Cir.1993) (\"[I]t is only in extraordinary cases that identification evidence should be withheld from the jury.\")(internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court acted well within its discretion in permitting the jury to consider the identification evidence. All the identifying officers saw videotapes and photographs of P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez before trial. Indeed, because law enforcement officials were intently reviewing those materials in an attempt to identify the perpetrators, a careful review of the visual evidence was an essential step in the investigation. This is not a situation involving a dubious photo array or a one-person show-up. <i>See, e.g., Jesus-Rios,</i> 990 F.2d at 677-78. Further, there is no entitlement to an in-court line-up or other particular procedure. <i>See Curtis,</i> 344 F.3d at 1063. And in any event, the argument has a bit of a surreal quality to it because P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez admitted that he was the individual in the photograph which accompanied the indictment and which was generated from the videotape of the riot that the officers reviewed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez next challenges the sufficiency of the evidence establishing the conspiracy and the value of the government property destroyed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> \"We will affirm the conviction if, after assaying all the evidence in the light most amiable to the government, and taking all reasonable inferences in its favor, a rational factfinder could find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the prosecution successfully proved the essential elements of the crime.\" <i>Boulerice,</i> 325 F.3d at 79 (internal citation and quotation omitted). The government need not succeed in \"eliminating every possible theory consistent with the defendant's innocence,\" and \"[w]e will affirm if any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal citation and quotation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In challenging his conspiracy conviction, P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez emphasizes that mere presence or similar actions to other individuals is insufficient to show membership in a conspiracy. He points out that there was no evidence of communication by cell phone or walkie-talkies, and that the incident can only be considered a riot and not the result of an organized criminal endeavor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prove the elements of the crime of conspiracy, the government must show the existence of a conspiracy, the defendant's knowledge of the conspiracy, and the defendant's voluntary participation in the conspiracy. More specifically, to establish that a defendant belonged to and participated in a conspiracy, the government must prove two kinds of intent: intent to agree [with his co-conspirators] and intent to commit the substantive offense. Such proof may consist of circumstantial evidence, such as acts committed by the defendant that furthered the conspiracy's purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v. Llinas,</i> 373 F.3d 26, 30 (1st Cir.2004) (internal citation and quotation omitted). The agreement \"need not be express, but may consist of no more than a tacit understanding.\" <i>United States v. Echeverri,</i> 982 F.2d 675, 679 (1st Cir.1993) (internal citation and quotation omitted). \"[E]ach coconspirator need not know of or have contact with all other members, nor must they know all of the details of the conspiracy or participate in every act in furtherance of it.\" <i>United States v. Martinez-Medina,</i> 279 F.3d 105, 113 (1st Cir.2002). However, mere presence at the scene or simple association with the conspirators will not suffice to establish guilt. <i>Llinas,</i> 373 F.3d at 32.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was sufficient evidence to support the conspiracy conviction. Various co-defendants came to the event armed with sledgehammers and wire cutters &#8212; odd things to bring to a celebration unless one was planning mischief. In addition, the attack appeared coordinated, with participants spilling on to the base at multiple entry points and nearly simultaneously. Moreover, the perpetrators covered the mile and a half from the main gate to Camp Garcia and the motor pool in about twenty minutes, which is suggestive of a planned assault. And if the evidence of a conspiracy is sufficient, there can be no doubt that the jury reasonably found P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez to be a conspirator. He is shown on videotape smashing the Humvee with a sledgehammer, scuffling with police, and driving a water truck into the main gate until it collapsed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> While the jury conceivably could have reached a different conclusion, that does not suffice to undermine the verdict. <i>See Echeverri,</i> 982 F.2d at 678(\"we require only that a jury's verdict be supportable, not that it be inevitable\"); <i>United States v. Batista-Polanco,</i> 927 F.2d 14, 17 (1st Cir.1991)(\"the factfinder may decide among reasonable interpretations of the evidence\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez next argues that the government failed to prove that the destroyed Humvee and main gate were valued at over $1,000 each. He asserts that the government's own records establish that the Humvee was transferred from the Navy to the USFWS at a value of $0, and that the main gate only cost $450 to build.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These arguments are frivolous. The government called witnesses who testified that the Humvee was only valued at $0 for purposes of the transfer because two federal entities (as opposed to an outside purchaser) were involved. Moreover, the government presented evidence that the replacement cost and residual value of the Humvee far exceeded $1000. And, while the gate may have only cost $450 to construct, it was constructed over forty years ago. Its current value (or replacement cost) was supportably pegged at more than $40,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez challenges the jury instructions regarding the conspiracy charge and the value of the government property destroyed. But he has not explained what was wrong with the conspiracy charge, and his attack on the instructions is both inadequately elaborated and, so far as we can tell, based upon the specious suggestion that the jury could have found the property destroyed to be worth less than $1000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of International Trade, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The government questions whether P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez preserved all issues for plenary appellate review, but opines that they fail on the merits in any event.

The U.S. Navy intended to end its presence in Vieques by transferring the lands making up its base to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (\"USFWS\") on May 1, 2003. Just prior to the transfer, the Navy provided the USFWS with several vehicles and other equipment previously used on the base. Most of the vehicles and equipment were enclosed in a fenced motor pool area within a thirty-five acre compound known as \"Camp Garcia.\" Camp Garcia was approximately one and a half miles from the base's main entrance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the night of April 30, 2003, a large crowd gathered outside the base's main gate to celebrate. The crowd included political figures, members of the media, and law enforcement officials on hand to keep the peace. But what began as a peaceful rally quickly turned into a riot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly before midnight, a large group armed with wire cutters and sledgehammers broke down a section of fencing and entered the base. Nearly simultaneously, others entered (or attempted to enter) the base at other points. Several of these intruders converged on Camp Garcia, broke down the fence, and commandeered and vandalized vehicles and equipment. With news cameras capturing the action, the rioters vandalized or destroyed a number of government vehicles, equipment and buildings. Most significantly for present purposes, they burned a Boston Whaler boat and a Humvee, and demolished the guard post at the main gate. Images and accounts of the riot were widely broadcast in Puerto Rico and formed the basis for public debate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Law enforcement officials reviewed photographs and videotapes of the incident and managed to isolate twelve significant participants, eleven of whom they could identify by name. A grand jury returned a six-count indictment against the twelve individuals (including the unidentified \"John Doe\" defendant who later proved to be P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez) for conspiracy, damaging government property, and damaging government property by fire or explosive. Four counts named the John Doe defendant: a count charging conspiracy to damage government property and to damage government property by fire or explosive, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 371, 1361, &amp; 844(f)(1) (Count I); a count charging aiding and abetting the destruction of the Humvee by means of fire, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(f)(1)(Count III); a count charging the destruction of the concrete entrance gate with damages exceeding $1000, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1361 (Count IV); and a count charging the destruction of the Humvee with damages exceeding $1000, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1361 (Count VI). An arrest warrant issued for the John Doe defendant. The warrant included the description \"Male, White Hispanic, Approximately 5 Feet 9 Inches and 210 Pounds\" and was accompanied by a photograph of P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez standing on a Humvee with a sledgehammer. The photo was provided to the news media and widely publicized. After seeing it, P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez went to the FBI and identified himself as both the \"John Doe\" defendant named in the indictment and the person in the photo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly before the scheduled trial, all of P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez's co-defendants pled guilty. After P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez unsuccessfully moved for a continuance or a change of venue, he was tried alone. At the voir dire, the district court questioned the potential jurors about their exposure to news stories about the riot and whether they could be impartial. While most had seen or read about the incident, only ten of the seventy-five potential jury candidates were excused because they could not be impartial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the government called law enforcement officers who were at the demonstration or involved in the investigation, government officials involved in the transfer of property between the Navy and the USFWS, and FBI Agent Amado Vega, the primary investigator. The government also introduced videotapes of the demonstration, photographs of the demonstration (some derived from the videotapes) and aftermath, and various other documentary evidence. The videotapes were particularly striking, as they showed P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez smashing a Humvee with a sledgehammer, scuffling with police, and repeatedly crashing a government water truck into the guard post until it collapsed.

P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez's claims about misleading and prejudicial presentation &#8212; an alleged \"slowing up\" of the tape and the inclusion of inflammatory audio commentary &#8212; are simply not supported by the record (and would not constitute reversible error if they were). The videotapes were also highly relevant, as they showed the offense as it occurred and corroborated many aspects of the government witnesses' testimony.

If so, the court must \"decide whether the identification itself was reliable under the totality of the circumstances, notwithstanding the suggestive procedure.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal citation and quotation omitted).

All the identifying officers saw videotapes and photographs of P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez before trial. Indeed, because law enforcement officials were intently reviewing those materials in an attempt to identify the perpetrators, a careful review of the visual evidence was an essential step in the investigation. This is not a situation involving a dubious photo array or a one-person show-up. <i>See, e.g., Jesus-Rios,</i> 990 F.2d at 677-78. Further, there is no entitlement to an in-court line-up or other particular procedure. <i>See Curtis,</i> 344 F.3d at 1063. And in any event, the argument has a bit of a surreal quality to it because P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez admitted that he was the individual in the photograph which accompanied the indictment and which was generated from the videotape of the riot that the officers reviewed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez next challenges the sufficiency of the evidence establishing the conspiracy and the value of the government property destroyed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> \"We will affirm the conviction if, after assaying all the evidence in the light most amiable to the government, and taking all reasonable inferences in its favor, a rational factfinder could find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the prosecution successfully proved the essential elements of the crime.\" <i>Boulerice,</i> 325 F.3d at 79 (internal citation and quotation omitted).

Batista-Polanco,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556636\"><a href=\"/opinion/556636/united-states-v-johnny-rafael-batista-polanco/\"><span class=\"volume\">927</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1991)(\"the factfinder may decide among reasonable interpretations of the evidence\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez next argues that the government failed to prove that the destroyed Humvee and main gate were valued at over $1,000 each. He asserts that the government's own records establish that the Humvee was transferred from the Navy to the USFWS at a value of $0, and that the main gate only cost $450 to build.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These arguments are frivolous. The government called witnesses who testified that the Humvee was only valued at $0 for purposes of the transfer because two federal entities (as opposed to an outside purchaser) were involved. Moreover, the government presented evidence that the replacement cost and residual value of the Humvee far exceeded $1000. And, while the gate may have only cost $450 to construct, it was constructed over forty years ago. Its current value (or replacement cost) was supportably pegged at more than $40,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez challenges the jury instructions regarding the conspiracy charge and the value of the government property destroyed. But he has not explained what was wrong with the conspiracy charge, and his attack on the instructions is both inadequately elaborated and, so far as we can tell, based upon the specious suggestion that the jury could have found the property destroyed to be worth less than $1000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of International Trade, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The government questions whether P&#233;rez-Gonz&#225;lez preserved all issues for plenary appellate review, but opines that they fail on the merits in any event.
