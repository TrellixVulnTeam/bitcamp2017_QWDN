We review a denial of asylum and\n\nwithholding of removal.      Flori Vasiliu, an Albanian citizen and\n\nmember of the Democratic Party there, was beaten near his home on\n\nOctober 17, 2000, by two civilians, one of whom was an off-duty\n\npolice officer.    He contends this was in retaliation for his\n\nactivities as a Democratic Party election monitor in his town's\n\nelections on October 1, 2000, during which he accused members of\n\nthe Socialist Party of committing election fraud.\n\n          He entered the United States illegally on November 29,\n\n2000, and on September 28, 2001 applied for asylum.         He was charged\n\nwith   removability,   and   at   an    initial   hearing    he   conceded\n\nremovability and renewed his request for asylum based on claims of\n\npast and future persecution by the ruling Socialist Party as a\n\nresult of his political affiliation.        In addition, he requested\n\nwithholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against\n\nTorture and, in the alternative, voluntary departure.             He had a\n\nremoval hearing on October 18, 2002, and the Immigration Judge (IJ)\n\nthat day denied his claims for asylum and withholding of removal,\n\nbut granted Vasiliu voluntary departure.\n\n          The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) summarily affirmed\n\non February 5, 2004, which renders the IJ's decision the final\n\norder for purposes of the petition for review now before us.\n\nAlbathani v. INS, 318 F.3d 365, 373 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n          Vasiliu argues that the IJ erred in finding he had not\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fmet his burden of proving eligibility for asylum as a result of\n\npersecution he endured, and expects to endure should he return to\n\nAlbania.\n\n           It was petitioner's burden to establish that he met the\n\ncriteria for asylum by establishing that he (1) suffered past\n\npersecution or (2) has a well founded fear of future persecution,\n\nbased on petitioner's race, religion, nationality, membership in a\n\nparticular social group, or political opinion, and that petitioner\n\nis unable or unwilling to return to or avail himself of the\n\nprotection of that country because of such persecution.       See 8\n\nC.F.R. ยง 1208.13(a)-(b).   As to his claim of past persecution, the\n\nIJ found that Vasiliu did not show that the beating he received was\n\nby the government or a group the government could not control.\n\nSilva v. Ashcroft, 394 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"Action by non-\n\ngovernmental actors can undergird a claim of persecution only if\n\nthere is some showing that the alleged persecutors are in league\n\nwith the government or are not controllable by the government.\").\n\nVasiliu was beaten by two civilians, one of whom he recognized as\n\na police officer from his town.    The IJ found that the officer was\n\nin plain clothes and not acting in an official capacity, and that\n\nthere was not adequate evidence to find that this one beating was\n\nin relation to his activities as an election worker, but rather was\n\nmore \"in the nature of a personal vendetta.\"        This finding is\n\nsupported by the evidence.   Vasiliu's affidavit submitted with his\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\frequest for asylum does not state that the men who assaulted him\n\nmentioned that the beating was in response to his activities as an\n\nelection worker for the Democratic Party, though he asserted this\n\nwas so in testimony.           Further, Vasiliu made no attempt to contact\n\nthe authorities after this assault.                 He explained this decision by\n\nclaiming that the authorities were also members of the Socialist\n\nParty and so, he assumed, would not help. Finally, Vasiliu's claim\n\nis belied by the fact that his parents and sister, all of whom\n\nopposed the governing Socialist Party, have remained in Albania and\n\nhave been safe and free from any persecution by the government, or\n\nany other members of the Socialist Party.\n\n              As to Vasiliu's claim of fear of future persecution, the\n\nIJ concluded that Vasiliu had not shown that he could not safely\n\nlive elsewhere in Albania and, thus, had not demonstrated that a\n\nreasonable     person     in    his    position      would   fear    persecution        if\n\nreturned to Albania. See Mukamusoni v. Ashcroft, 390 F.3d 110, 120\n\n(1st   Cir.    2004)      (\"[T]o      show    a    well-founded     fear    of    future\n\npersecution,\"        an   applicant      must       show   \"that    [his]    fear      is\n\nreasonable.\").         Vasiliu made no effort to relocate elsewhere,\n\ntestifying vaguely that \"[e]verywhere I would go, they would find\n\nme.\"   Vasiliu's claimed fear of future persecution is also belied\n\nby the fact that, in the four years since he left, his sister and\n\nparents have remained there free from any harm.                     Further, having\n\nheld   that    the    IJ's     finding       that    Vasiliu's     beating       was   not\n\n\n                                             -4-\n\fnecessarily related to his actions as an election worker was\n\nsupported by substantial evidence, there is no support for the\n\nnotion that Vasiliu is now in danger of persecution across all of\n\nAlbania.\n\n     Contrary to Vasiliu's assertion, the IJ did not commit an\n\nerror of law in finding that he had not met his burden of proving\n\neligibility for asylum.1   The IJ and BIA decisions are affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Because we hold that Vasiliu failed to satisfy the standard\nfor asylum, he a fortiori cannot satisfy the more stringent\nwithholding of removal standard. See Romilus v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d\n1, 8 (1st Cir. 2004). Further, since Vasiliu has not shown that he\nwould be tortured at the hands of the government or with its\nacquiescence upon return to Albania, he cannot meet his burden for\nrelief under the Convention Against Torture.
