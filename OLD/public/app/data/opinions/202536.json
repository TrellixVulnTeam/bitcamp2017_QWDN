Rodríguez-Vélez, United States Attorney, Nelson Pérez\nSosa, Assistant United States Attorney, and Germán A. Rieckehoff,\nAssistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n                           November 21, 2006\n\f          Per Curiam.    Appellant Manuel Perez-Colon appeals from\n\nthe district court's judgment dismissing his complaint.        This\n\ncomplaint seeks the return of property ($3,000 in cash) which the\n\nUnited States Marshals had seized from appellant.        Forfeiture\n\nproceedings against the cash were never instituted, and, shortly\n\nafter the seizure, the money was turned over to the Puerto Rico\n\nTreasury Department.    The district court, prior to service of\n\nprocess, dismissed the complaint, sua sponte, on the ground that\n\nappellant had failed to exhaust his prison remedies as required by\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a).   On appeal, we reversed the dismissal and\n\nremanded for further proceedings, holding that if the money had\n\nbeen seized at the time of appellant's arrest, as opposed to having\n\nbeen seized at the time he entered prison, exhaustion would not be\n\nrequired, and appellant would be permitted to bring a civil action\n\nin equity for the return of the $3,000.   Perez-Colon v. Camacho, 73\n\nFed. Appx. 474, 475-76 (1st Cir. 2003) (per curiam).\n\n          On remand -- where it was established that the money, in\n\nfact, had been seized during appellant's arrest -- the government\n\nfiled a motion to dismiss the complaint, arguing essentially that\n\n(1) construing the complaint as asserting a tort claim, appellant\n\nhad failed to comply with the requirements for filing such a claim\n\nas set out in the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), (2) construing\n\nthe complaint as asserting a claim under Bivens v. Six Unknown\n\nNamed Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971),\n\n\n                               -2-\n\fqualified immunity protected the defendants from a money judgment,\n\nand (3) since the seizure had been legal, appellant's rights under\n\nthe Fourth Amendment had not been violated.          After appellant filed\n\na response, the district court entered a judgment dismissing the\n\ncomplaint, stating that it was relying on the reasons given by the\n\ngovernment in its motion to dismiss.         The instant appeal ensued,\n\nand, once again, the judgment of the district court must be vacated\n\nand the matter remanded for further proceedings.\n\n             Generally, after a defendant has been convicted, the\n\ndefendant \"is presumed to have a right to [the] return\" of any\n\nproperty that has been seized from him or her.             United States v.\n\nChambers, 192 F.3d 374, 377 (3d Cir. 1999); United States v. Potes\n\nRamirez, 260 F.3d 1310, 1314 (11th Cir. 2001).         In a case where, as\n\nhere, the government has not forfeited the property in question, a\n\nmotion under Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(g) -- formerly Rule 41(e) -- is\n\nthe proper basis for a request for the return of such property.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Sims, 376 F.3d 705, 708 (7th Cir. 2004)\n\n(holding that, unless the seized property has been forfeited, Rule\n\n41(g)   is   the   proper   remedy   for   seeking   the   return   of   such\n\nproperty); Chambers, 192 F.3d at 376 (holding, in a case where\n\nthere had been no forfeiture, that \"[a] person aggrieved by the\n\ndeprivation of property may file a motion under Rule 41(e) . . . to\n\nrequest the return of that property\") (footnote omitted).            When a\n\nRule 41(g) motion is filed after the criminal proceedings have\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fended, also as here, the motion is treated as a civil proceeding\n\nfor equitable relief. See Sims, 376 F.3d at 707-08; Potes Ramirez,\n\n260 F.3d at 1314; Chambers, 192 F.3d 376.\n\n            Because appellant has a cause of action under Rule 41(g),\n\nhe has no need to base his claim for the return of the $3,000 on\n\neither the FTCA or Bivens.      As a result, the questions whether\n\nappellant complied with the requirements of the FTCA and whether\n\nthe defendants are entitled to qualified immunity are not relevant\n\nto a resolution of this case.     We therefore turn to the terms of\n\nRule 41(g).\n\n            Rule 41(g) provides as follows:\n\n                      A person aggrieved by an\n                 unlawful search and seizure of\n                 property or by the deprivation of\n                 property may move for the property's\n                 return. The motion must be filed in\n                 the district where the property was\n                 seized.    The court must receive\n                 evidence   on any factual issue\n                 necessary to decide the motion. If\n                 it grants the motion, the court must\n                 return the property to the movant,\n                 but may impose reasonable conditions\n                 to protect access to the property\n                 and its use in later proceedings.\n\n(emphasis added). Given the highlighted language, it is plain that\n\nRule 41(g) applies to legally, as well as to illegally, seized\n\nproperty.     See Government of the Virgin Islands v. Edwards, 903\n\nF.2d 267, 273 (3d Cir. 1990) (\"Under [a] 1989 amendment, Rule 41(e)\n\nis no longer limited to property held following an unlawful search\n\nor seizure\"); 3A Charles Alan Wright, Nancy J. King & Susan R.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fKlein, Federal Practice and Procedure § 673, at 336 (3d ed. 2004)\n\n(same).     Thus, it is no answer to appellant's motion to say that\n\nthe seizure of the $3,000 was legal.\n\n            A Rule 41(g) motion nonetheless may be denied \"if the\n\ndefendant is not entitled to lawful possession of the seized\n\nproperty, the property is contraband or subject to forfeiture[,] or\n\nthe government's need for the property as evidence continues.\"\n\nChambers, 192 F.3d at 377 (internal quotation marks and citation\n\nomitted).    It is the government's burden, after the termination of\n\ncriminal proceedings, to demonstrate that return of the property is\n\nnot warranted, and one way that the government may meet this burden\n\nis to show \"a cognizable claim of ownership or right to possession\n\nadverse to that of the movant.\"             Id.   A case on point is United\n\nStates v. Francis, 646 F.2d 251 (6th Cir. 1981).\n\n            In   Francis,   federal   agents      had   seized   approximately\n\n$20,000 from the defendant and then, while the defendant's Rule\n\n41(e) motion was pending, transferred the cash to the state of\n\nMichigan under a warrant of levy on the defendant's property for\n\nnonpayment of state taxes.      In affirming the denial of defendant's\n\nmotion for the return of the money, the court of appeals first\n\nrejected the government's argument that, since it no longer had the\n\nproperty, the case was moot.          The question remained, the court\n\nheld, whether the government's transfer had been lawful -- i.e.,\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fwhether the transfer had been made pursuant to a right to the money\n\nthat trumped the defendant's rights.            Id. at 262-63.\n\n              Turning to this question, the court, by analogy to cases\n\ninvolving     the   Internal      Revenue    Service,     determined      that   the\n\ngovernment, in fact, had a \"continuing interest\" in the money and\n\nthat   this    interest     was   sufficient    to    defeat    the     defendant's\n\ninterest:\n\n                    The courts have uniformly held that\n                    the [IRS] may lawfully attach\n                    property belonging to a defendant .\n                    . . and that the tax lien will\n                    frustrate a motion for return of the\n                    property. [T]he lien cannot violate\n                    any rights that defendant has in the\n                    money because even if the money were\n                    returned to him, nothing would\n                    prevent    the    government    from\n                    immediately levying on it at the\n                    time of its return.     It makes no\n                    difference that in this case it is\n                    a state rather than the IRS which\n                    has asserted an interest in the\n                    seized cash. The State of Michigan\n                    may validly levy on money owned by\n                    defendant that is in the possession\n                    of the government.\n\nId. at 263 (citations and footnote omitted).\n\n              The court of appeals then determined that the lien that\n\nthe state had attached to the defendant's money was facially valid\n\nand that it was broad enough to reach the money that the government\n\nhad seized.      Id. at 263.       Given this, and given that the federal\n\ngovernment     lacked   a   greater    interest      in   the   cash,    the   court\n\nconcluded that the government had been required to comply with the\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\flien by turning the money over to the state.         Id.   Thus, the court\n\nheld, the transfer had been lawful.        Id.   See also United States v.\n\nFitzen, 80 F.3d 387, 388-89 (9th Cir. 1996) (affirming the denial\n\nof the appellant's Rule 41(g) motion to the extent that the seized\n\nproperty (1) was subject to an Idaho state tax levy or (2) had been\n\nforfeited pursuant to Idaho forfeiture law).\n\n           The problem here is that the government never explained\n\nthe precise nature of the Commonwealth's interest in appellant's\n\nmoney, and, as a result, there is no way to determine whether the\n\ntransfer of that money was lawful.               A remand, therefore, is\n\nrequired so that the court can make a finding on the matter.             See\n\nRule 41(g) (\"[t]he court must receive evidence on any factual issue\n\nnecessary to decide the motion\").      We add that, given the course of\n\nthe proceedings up until now, appellant may desire, on remand, to\n\nrequest the appointment of counsel.        See United States v. Giraldo,\n\n45 F.3d 509, 512 (1st Cir. 1995) (per curiam) (where a pro se\n\nprisoner   was   challenging,   in    a    civil   equitable   action,    an\n\nadministrative forfeiture of property that had been seized from\n\nhim, we noted that he was free to request an appointment of counsel\n\nin   the   district   court;    citing     cases    permitting   such     an\n\nappointment).\n\n           Finally, we note that, if the district court decides that\n\nappellant is entitled to the return of the $3,000, the government's\n\nargument that sovereign immunity bars relief in this case is\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fmisplaced.   That is, appellant is not asking for money damages\n\nhere.   Rather, he is seeking equitable relief \"notwithstanding the\n\nfact that the property at issue is currency.\"      Polanco v. United\n\nStates Drug Enforcement Admin., 158 F.3d 647, 652 (2d Cir. 1998).\n\nThat is, \"[i]n suing for return of the currency, [appellant] seeks\n\nrestitution of 'the very thing' to which he claims an entitlement,\n\nnot damages in substitution for a loss.\"     United States v. Minor,\n\n228 F.3d 352, 355 (4th Cir. 2000).       Further, \"the fact that the\n\ngovernment obviously cannot restore to [appellant] the specific\n\ncurrency that was seized does not transform the motion into an\n\naction at law.\"   Id.\n\n           The judgment of the district court is vacated, and the\n\nmatter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this\n\nopinion.   No costs are awarded.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\f",

This\n\ncomplaint seeks the return of property ($3,000 in cash) which the\n\nUnited States Marshals had seized from appellant.

In affirming the denial of defendant's\n\nmotion for the return of the money, the court of appeals first\n\nrejected the government's argument that, since it no longer had the\n\nproperty, the case was moot.          The question remained, the court\n\nheld, whether the government's transfer had been lawful -- i.e.,\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fwhether the transfer had been made pursuant to a right to the money\n\nthat trumped the defendant's rights.            Id. at 262-63.\n\n              Turning to this question, the court, by analogy to cases\n\ninvolving     the   Internal      Revenue    Service,     determined      that   the\n\ngovernment, in fact, had a \"continuing interest\" in the money and\n\nthat   this    interest     was   sufficient    to    defeat    the     defendant's\n\ninterest:\n\n                    The courts have uniformly held that\n                    the [IRS] may lawfully attach\n                    property belonging to a defendant .\n                    . . and that the tax lien will\n                    frustrate a motion for return of the\n                    property. [T]he lien cannot violate\n                    any rights that defendant has in the\n                    money because even if the money were\n                    returned to him, nothing would\n                    prevent    the    government    from\n                    immediately levying on it at the\n                    time of its return.     It makes no\n                    difference that in this case it is\n                    a state rather than the IRS which\n                    has asserted an interest in the\n                    seized cash. The State of Michigan\n                    may validly levy on money owned by\n                    defendant that is in the possession\n                    of the government.\n\nId. at 263 (citations and footnote omitted).\n\n              The court of appeals then determined that the lien that\n\nthe state had attached to the defendant's money was facially valid\n\nand that it was broad enough to reach the money that the government\n\nhad seized.      Id. at 263.       Given this, and given that the federal\n\ngovernment     lacked   a   greater    interest      in   the   cash,    the   court\n\nconcluded that the government had been required to comply with the\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\flien by turning the money over to the state.         Id.   Thus, the court\n\nheld, the transfer had been lawful.        Id.
