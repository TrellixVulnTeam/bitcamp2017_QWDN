On February 21, 2001, plaintiffs\n\nSantos Rivera-Torres (\"Rivera\"), his wife (Daisy Nazario-Santana),\n\nand   two   daughters    (Yasira      Rivera-Nazario     and     Zahira   Rivera-\n\nNazario),1 brought this claim against the municipality of Sabana\n\nGrande and four municipal officers pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n\nRivera alleged that he was the victim of adverse employment actions\n\nmotivated by political animus, in violation of the First and\n\nFourteenth Amendments.           After a series of preliminary orders\n\nremoving three of the four individual defendants from the action,\n\nthe trial began on December 3, 2002, against the municipality of\n\nSabana Grande and Miguel Ortiz Velez (\"Ortiz\"), the mayor of Sabana\n\nGrande,     who   was   sued    in    both    his   individual    and     official\n\ncapacities.       At the conclusion of the four-day trial, the jury\n\nfound that \"protected political activity was a substantial or\n\nmotivating    factor    in     the   defendant's    decision     to   politically\n\ndiscriminate against the plaintiff,\" and awarded Rivera $60,000 in\n\nlost wages and benefits,2 $125,000 in compensatory damages, and\n\n$250,000 in punitive damages.           The jury also awarded compensatory\n\ndamages in the amount of $75,000 to plaintiff's wife, and $30,000\n\n\n\n      1\n      Because the claims brought by Rivera's wife and two daughters\nare derivative of Rivera's political discrimination claim, we\ndesignate Rivera the \"plaintiff\" and refer to the other co-\nplaintiffs by name where necessary.\n      2\n      After the jury issued its verdict, the court sua sponte\nreduced the award for lost wages and benefits from $60,000 to\n$26,400. Rivera does not contest this reduction on appeal.\n\n                                        -2-\n\fto each of plaintiff's daughters.             With several alterations, the\n\ncourt entered judgment on the jury's verdict, and the defendants\n\nfiled these timely appeals.\n\n           Defendants      raise   a     plethora   of   objections    to   the\n\nproceedings below, challenging inter alia the court's denial of\n\nqualified immunity, its refusal to stay proceedings pending the\n\nresolution     of   an     attempted      interlocutory      appeal,    various\n\nevidentiary rulings at trial, the court's interrogation of a\n\ndefense witness, and the validity of the jury's damage award.\n\nAfter    careful    review    of   the    record,   we    reject   defendants'\n\nchallenges and affirm the judgment.\n\n                                         I.\n\n             In 1980, Rivera was hired by the mayor of Sabana Grande\n\nto work in various capacities at the municipal gym.3               Plaintiff's\n\nduties included training boxers and weight lifters, teaching self-\n\ndefense   classes    for     children,    and   organizing   weight    lifting,\n\nboxing, gymnastics, and karate competitions at locations around\n\nSabana Grande.       Most municipal jobs in Puerto Rico are sub-\n\nclassified as \"career positions\" (akin to civil service jobs) or\n\n\"trust positions\" (political appointments).              Municipal employees\n\nare similarly designated \"career\" or \"trust\" employees.                 At all\n\ntimes, Rivera was a career employee, and his job was designated a\n\n\n     3\n      The facts presented here are intended to convey a general\nimpression of the case. We provide additional facts where they are\npertinent to the legal analysis.\n\n                                       -3-\n\fcareer position.      In 1992, twelve years after plaintiff was hired,\n\nthe    incumbent    mayor   promoted    him     to   \"be   in    charge   of   the\n\ngymnasium.\"      Although this managerial post was originally a \"trust\n\nposition,\" the municipality reclassified it as a career job to\n\nfacilitate plaintiff's promotion.\n\n            At the time of the promotion, Rivera was a member of the\n\nPopular Democratic Party (\"PDP\"), though his allegiances were\n\ngradually shifting to the New Progressive Party (\"NPP\").                  Over the\n\nnext six years, from 1992 to 1998, Rivera's tenure as manager of\n\nthe municipal gym was uneventful, and the record indicates that he\n\nreceived only positive employment evaluations.                In December 1998,\n\nplaintiff formally joined the NPP, and local party leaders asked\n\nhim to run as the NPP candidate for mayor of Sabana Grande.                    One\n\nweek    later,   plaintiff   publicly        accepted   the     party's   mayoral\n\nnomination at an NPP \"plebiscite\" (caucus).\n\n            Rivera's candidacy created a potentially awkward work\n\nenvironment.       His opponent in the mayoral election was incumbent\n\nmayor Miguel Ortiz Velez, who also happened to be plaintiff's boss\n\nby virtue of being mayor.         Rivera testified at trial that his\n\nrelationship with Ortiz changed dramatically after he announced his\n\ncandidacy. That month, after returning from a three-week vacation,\n\nplaintiff discovered that the telephone had been removed from his\n\noffice in the gymnasium.       Rivera also learned that the mayor was\n\nrequesting daily reports on his work habits from other coworkers\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fstationed at the gym.     In March 1999, the mayor observed Rivera\n\noutside his \"area\" during working hours, and ordered his secretary\n\nto make notations on plaintiff's time card documenting his absence\n\nfrom work.     When plaintiff confronted the vice-mayor of Sabana\n\nGrande over the incident, he received a thirty-day suspension for\n\n\"being disrespectful to the vice-mayor.\"             Rivera appealed this\n\nsuspension to the Commonwealth's Board of Appeals for the Personnel\n\nAdministration System (\"JASAP\"), which reversed his suspension and\n\nawarded Rivera thirty days' back pay.          The Board's decision was\n\naffirmed on appeal to the Commonwealth's Court of Appeals, and the\n\nPuerto Rico Supreme Court denied certiorari.\n\n          In   the   aftermath   of    the   JASAP   proceedings,   Rivera\n\ncontinued to experience harassment at work.          The locks on the gym\n\nwere changed to inhibit his access, and on one occasion Rivera\n\nfound a stack of his personal and office documents torn up next to\n\na trash can near his office.          He was stripped of authority to\n\ndirect the activities of subordinates at the gym, and he had\n\nseveral prolonged arguments with Ortiz at the gymnasium.            On one\n\noccasion, the mayor ordered him to complete maintenance tasks that\n\nwere not within the scope of his duties.         The defendants did not\n\nseriously dispute these incidents at trial.\n\n          In May 2000, Rivera sought and received an offer of\n\nstate-level employment at the Commonwealth Department of Sports and\n\nRecreation in nearby Mayaguez.     At the time, the head of the Sport\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fAdministration Department was Eric Labrador, a fellow member of the\n\nNPP.     Because    Puerto     Rico     law   prohibits     individuals    from\n\nsimultaneously holding state and municipal-level employment, Rivera\n\npetitioned the municipality for a transfer.               However, Mayor Ortiz\n\nrefused to approve Rivera's transfer.              Rivera testified that the\n\nmayor's secretary informed him that \"the mayor would not sign\n\nunimportant papers.\"\n\n            Rivera was anxious to accept the state-level position\n\nbefore   the   November      2000     elections,     anticipating   that    the\n\nemployment offer would be rescinded if a PDP administration were\n\nelected into    office.      Thus, on June 5, 2000, Rivera submitted an\n\nirrevocable    letter   of    resignation     to    the   municipality.     The\n\nconsequences of resigning in lieu of obtaining a transfer were\n\nsevere. Plaintiff stood to sacrifice the twenty years of seniority\n\nhe had accumulated since 1980 for salary and benefit purposes.\n\nHowever, even this initiative proved unavailing when Ortiz refused\n\nto accept Rivera's resignation, citing an ongoing investigation\n\ninto Rivera's excessive absenteeism over the previous five months.\n\nMayor Ortiz testified at trial that under Puerto Rico law, a\n\nmunicipality loses the authority to discipline a municipal employee\n\nonce that employee has been transferred to a state agency.                Hence,\n\nit was critical to delay plaintiff's transfer request until the\n\nadministrative     investigation       into   his    absenteeism    had     been\n\nresolved.\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\f            Rivera insisted that his absences were due to work-\n\nrelated illnesses, and he instructed his doctor, Silva Cherena, to\n\nsubmit    medical    reports     to   the   municipality    documenting   his\n\nsymptoms.        Indeed,   Dr.   Cherena    had   sent   plaintiff's   medical\n\ninformation to the municipality on July 1, 2000.              However, Mayor\n\nOrtiz's office claimed not to have received the doctor's letter\n\nuntil October 31, 2000.           Two weeks later, Mayor Ortiz finally\n\naccepted Rivera's irrevocable resignation, nearly five-and-a-half\n\nmonths after it was tendered.          In the intervening period, the NPP\n\nparty had been voted out of key Commonwealth positions, and the job\n\noffer at the Commonwealth Department of Sports and Recreation was\n\nno longer available.       Rivera was unable to find other work, and his\n\nfamily suffered significant financial and emotional hardship as a\n\nresult.\n\n            In the opinion accompanying its November 26, 2002 order\n\ngranting partial summary judgment to defendants, the district court\n\ndistilled Rivera's accusations into five discrete allegations of\n\npolitical discrimination:\n\n            1)       In January 1999, Defendants removed the phone\n                     from Plaintiff's office;\n\n            2)       In January 1999, Defendant Ortiz ordered Arenas,\n                     another employee of the Municipality, to take on\n                     Plaintiff's job duties, supervise Plaintiff, and\n                     track his movements;\n\n            3)       In March 1999, Defendants falsely accused and\n                     unjustly suspended Plaintiff for leaving his\n                     work-area and being absent from work;\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f            4)        In April 2000, Defendant Ortiz refused to approve\n                      Plaintiff's transfer to the Commonwealth's Sports\n                      and Recreation Department in Mayaguez;\n\n            5)        On June 28, 2000, Defendant Ortiz declined to\n                      accept   Plaintiff's    resignation   and then\n                      intentionally deferred the decision, accepting\n                      the resignation only after the elections.\n\nThe    defendants     conceded     that    Rivera         had   properly    preserved\n\nallegations 4 and 5, but argued that the first three allegations\n\nwere    time-barred.        The   district        court    agreed,    and   dismissed\n\nallegations 1, 2 and 3 in its partial order of summary judgment on\n\nNovember 26, 2000.          Of particular relevance to this case, the\n\ndistrict court's November 26 order also denied Mayor Ortiz's\n\nrequest for qualified immunity.                  On December 3, 2002, the case\n\nproceeded    to     trial   on    Rivera's       two   preserved      allegations    of\n\ndiscrimination. The jury delivered its verdict on December 9, and\n\nthese appeals followed.\n\n                                          II.\n\nA.     Pre-Trial Rulings\n\n1.     Denial of Summary Judgment\n\n             The    defendants     level     a    three-pronged       attack   on    the\n\ndistrict court's failure to dismiss Rivera's case outright on\n\nsummary judgment. First, they argue that \"the determination of the\n\nCourt that plaintiffs had made out a prima facie case rested on\n\nevidence     that    was    ultimately       inadmissible        at   trial    and    on\n\ninferences from facts not properly on the summary judgment record.\"\n\nSee Finn v. Consolidated Rail Corp. 782 F.2d 13, 16 (1st Cir. 1986)\n\n                                       -8-\n\f(\"Material that would be inadmissible at trial cannot be considered\n\non a motion for summary judgment because, if offered at trial, it\n\nwould not serve to establish a genuine issue of material fact.\").\n\nSecond, defendants allege that Rivera failed as a matter of law to\n\nproffer evidence sufficient to overcome summary judgment. Finally,\n\ndefendants challenge the district court's denial of qualified\n\nimmunity at the summary judgment stage.\n\n              These objections are unavailing.          Because the appeal in\n\nthis case follows a full trial and verdict, the district court's\n\nrulings at the summary judgment stage were \"overtaken by subsequent\n\nevents\":\n\n              We need not address the merits of [a]\n              preverdict challenge to the sufficiency of the\n              evidence on the motion for summary judgment.\n              Such an attack on the denial of defendant's\n              motion   for  summary   judgment   \"has   been\n              overtaken by subsequent events, namely, a\n              full-dress trial and an adverse jury verdict\"\n              . . . . The rationale for this rule has been\n              based on the procedural fact that a denial of\n              a motion for summary judgment \"is merely a\n              judge's determination that genuine issues of\n              material fact exist.   It is not a judgment,\n              and does not foreclose trial on issues on\n              which summary judgment was sought.\" Hence, a\n              challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence\n              adduced on the motion to support the district\n              court's conclusion that genuine issues of\n              material fact exist will not lie on appeal.\n\nEastern Mountain Platform Tennis, Inc. v. Sherwin-Williams, Co., 40\n\nF.3d   492,    500   (1st   Cir.   1994)    (internal    citations   omitted).\n\nAlthough Eastern Mountain specifically references sufficiency of\n\nthe evidence challenges, objections to the court's pre-trial denial\n\n                                      -9-\n\fof qualified immunity in its summary judgment ruling are subject to\n\nthe same rule of trial preemption.            As we noted in Iacobucci v.\n\nBoulter, 193 F.3d 14 (1st Cir. 1999), that rule generally bars non-\n\ninterlocutory appeals grounded solely in error at the summary\n\njudgment stage:\n\n              Although [the defendant] tried in this forum\n              to assign error to the denial of that motion,\n              a pair of procedural impediments frustrates\n              the attempt. For one thing, an order denying\n              summary judgment typically does not merge into\n              the final judgment and therefore is not an\n              independently appealable event if the case\n              thereafter proceeds to trial.\n\nId. at 22 (citing Eastern Mountain, 40 F.3d at 497).\n\n              Consequently, although a post-trial grant of immunity\n\nwould still confer a benefit on defendants by shielding them from\n\nany liability for monetary damages awarded by the jury, a defendant\n\ndetermined     to   persist   in   challenging    the   court's   denial   of\n\nqualified immunity cannot rest on the objection lodged at the\n\nsummary judgment stage, but must move for judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw at the conclusion of the trial.           If the court adheres to its\n\noriginal position, the defendant may then appeal from the denial of\n\njudgment as a matter of law.       A contrary rule would contradict the\n\nprinciple enshrined in our jurisprudence that facts elicited at\n\ntrial   are    often   probative   of   the   defendant's   entitlement    to\n\nqualified immunity.      See Stella v. Kelley, 63 F.3d 71, 74 (1st Cir.\n\n1995) (declining to permit interlocutory appeals from a court's\n\nrejection of qualified immunity \"to the extent that it turns on\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\feither an issue of fact or an issue perceived by the trial court to\n\nbe an issue of fact\"); 15A Wright, Miller & Cooper, Federal\n\nPractice and Procedure § 3914.10. (\"[O]nce trial has been had, the\n\navailability of official immunity [on final judgment of appeal]\n\nshould be determined by the trial record, not the pleadings nor the\n\nsummary judgment record.\").\n\n           Here,   defendants   failed     to   properly   preserve their\n\nchallenge to the court's denial of qualified immunity by restating\n\ntheir objections in a post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw.   Accordingly, we deem the defendants' challenge waived.\n\n2.   A Forsyth Appeal\n\n           On December 2, 2002 -- nearly one week after the district\n\ncourt's   ruling   granting   partial    summary   judgment   and   denying\n\nqualified immunity -- Ortiz filed a notice of appeal of the\n\ndistrict court's decision to deny qualified immunity.         In Mitchell\n\nv. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511 (1985), the Supreme Court ruled that a\n\ndefendant denied qualified immunity by a district court could file\n\nan interlocutory appeal to obtain review of any disputed question\n\nof law.   \"[W]e hold that a district court's denial of a claim of\n\nqualified immunity, to the extent that it turns on an issue of law,\n\nis an appealable 'final decision' within the meaning of 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1291 notwithstanding the absence of a final judgment.\"            Forsyth,\n\nId. at 530.   The Forsyth Court reasoned that \"the entitlement [to\n\nqualified immunity] is an immunity from suit rather than a mere\n\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fdefense   to   liability;       and   like    an   absolute   immunity,   it    is\n\neffectively lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to\n\ntrial.\"   Id. at 526 (emphasis in original).\n\n           The     act     of   filing       an    interlocutory    appeal     has\n\njurisdictional implications:\n\n           The filing of . . . an interlocutory appeal,\n           \"confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals\n           and divests the district court of control over\n           those aspects of the case involved in the\n           appeal.\"     Griggs v. Provident Consumer\n           Discount Co., 459 U.S. 56, 58 (1982) (per\n           curiam). The district court does not regain\n           jurisdiction over those issues until the court\n           of appeals issues its mandate.     Courts have\n           carved out a few narrow exceptions to this\n           rule, such as where the defendant frivolously\n           appeals or takes an interlocutory appeal from\n           a non-appealable order.\n\nUnited States v. Defries, 129 F.3d 1293, 1302-03 (D.C. Cir. 1997)\n\n(emphasis added).        These exceptions to the jurisdictional rule\n\nrecited   in     Defries    figure     prominently      in    the   post-Forsyth\n\njurisprudence of several circuits. In Apostol v. Gallion, 870 F.2d\n\n1335 (7th Cir. 1989), the court of appeals observed that\n\n           although [Forsyth] protects the interests of\n           the defendants claiming qualified immunity, it\n           may injure the legitimate interests of other\n           litigants and the judicial system . . . .\n           Defendants may seek to stall because they gain\n           from   delay   at   plaintiffs'  expense,   an\n           incentive    yielding   unjustified   appeals.\n           Defendants may take Forsyth appeals for\n           tactical as well as strategic reasons:\n           disappointed by the denial of a continuance,\n           they may help themselves to a postponement by\n           lodging a notice of appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\fId. at 1338-39.      In a subset of interlocutory appeals of qualified\n\nimmunity rulings, the \"notice of appeal may be so baseless that it\n\ndoes not invoke appellate jurisdiction\" even when filed.               Id. at\n\n1339.    To address other \"sham\" appeals whose lack of merit is not\n\nso transparent as to preclude the transfer of jurisdiction to the\n\nappellate    court    in   the   first   instance,   the   Seventh    Circuit\n\ndeveloped a \"certification\" process whereby \"a district court may\n\ncertify to the court of appeals that the appeal is frivolous and\n\n[retrieve jurisdiction to] get on with the trial.\"           Id.     The court\n\nadmonished that\n\n            [s]uch a power must be used with restraint,\n            just as the power to dismiss a complaint for\n            lack of jurisdiction because it is frivolous\n            is anomalous and must be used with restraint.\n            But it is there, and it may be valuable in\n            cutting short the deleterious effects of\n            unfounded appeals.\n\nId.     Following the Seventh Circuit's lead, the Sixth, Ninth, and\n\nTenth circuits established similar certification procedures to\n\naddress interlocutory appeals challenging the denial of qualified\n\nimmunity (\"Forsyth appeals\").        See Yates v. City of Cleveland, 941\n\nF.2d 444, 448-49 (6th Cir. 1991);         Chuman v. Wright, 960 F.2d 104,\n\n105 (9th Cir. 1992); Stewart v. Donges, 915 F.2d 572, 577 (10th\n\nCir. 1990).\n\n            The circuits adopting this certification procedure have\n\nheld or implied that the district court's act of filing the\n\n\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fcertification   of   frivolousness   is   an   event   of   jurisdictional\n\nsignificance.\n\n           [I]t is the district court's certification of\n           the defendant's appeal as frivolous or\n           forfeited rather than merely the fact that the\n           appeal is frivolous which allows the district\n           court to retain jurisdiction to conduct a\n           trial . . . . Once a notice of appeal on an\n           appealable issue such as qualified immunity is\n           filed, the status quo is that the district\n           court has lost jurisdiction to proceed.     To\n           regain   jurisdiction,   it  must   take   the\n           affirmative step of certifying the appeal as\n           frivolous or forfeited, and until that step is\n           taken it simply lacks jurisdiction to proceed\n           with the trial.\n\nStewart, 915 F.2d at 577-78 (emphasis in original); see also\n\nChuman, 960 F.2d at 105; Yates, 941 F.2d at 449; Apostol, 870 F.2d\n\nat 1339.\n\n           This proposition -- that a district court must actually\n\nfile the certification of frivolousness to retrieve jurisdiction\n\nover the proceedings -- is the springboard for defendants' argument\n\nthat the trial in this case was a nullity.        On November 26, 2002,\n\nthe district court initially entered an Opinion and Order denying\n\ndefendants' pre-trial request for qualified immunity.          On December\n\n2, defendants responded by filing a notice of appeal from the\n\ndenial of immunity and moving the district court to stay the\n\nproceedings pending the resolution of the appeal.              Immediately\n\nthereafter they petitioned this court for a stay of the district\n\n\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\fcourt proceedings.4   Without the benefit of an order from the\n\ndistrict court denying the motion to stay, we denied the requested\n\nstay in a summary order issued that same day:\n\n          The motion to stay trial is denied.         In\n          denying   appellants'   motion   for   summary\n          judgment based on qualified immunity, the\n          district court stated that \"Ortiz's motivation\n          for   denying   and    deferring   Plaintiff's\n          resignation is an unresolved issue of material\n          fact.\"    As appellants have not adequately\n          explained why the denial is immediately\n          appealable, see Stella v. Kelley, 63 F.3d 71,\n          74 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"a district court's\n          pretrial rejection of a qualified immunity\n          defense is not immediately appealable to the\n          extent that it turns on either an issue of\n          fact or an issue perceived by the trial court\n          to be an issue of fact\"), the motion for stay\n          is denied.\n\n          On December 3, 2002, the district court began the trial.\n\nMeanwhile, defendants had filed a motion for reconsideration of our\n\nDecember 2, 2002 order denying the stay.   By order dated December\n\n6, 2002, we rejected the defendants' motion for reconsideration:\n\n          To the extent that defendant is asking this\n          court to immediately stay any further trial,\n          the request is denied.       We request the\n          district court, however, to expressly act on\n          defendant's motion for stay. See Hegarty v.\n          Somerset County, 25 F.3d 17, 18 (1st Cir.\n          1994); Chuman v. Wright, 960 F.2d 104, 105\n          (9th Cir. 1992) (\"Should the district court\n          find that the defendants' claim of qualified\n          immunity is frivolous or has been waived, the\n\n     4\n      The district court's order of December 6, 2002 indicates that\ndefendants filed both their notice of appeal and request for a stay\nwith the district court at 4:48 p.m. on December 2. Defendants\nalso petitioned this court for a stay of the district court\nproceedings that same day, although the precise time this request\nwas filed is not clear from the record.\n\n                               -15-\n\f          district court may certify, in writing, that\n          defendants have forfeited their right to\n          pretrial appeal, and may proceed with trial\").\n          Any renewed request for a stay filed in the\n          court of appeals must be accompanied by\n          sufficient portions of the record to allow for\n          intelligent review.\n\nIn the interim, however, the district court had nearly completed\n\nthe trial. On December 6, after entertaining closing arguments and\n\nissuing instructions to the jury, the district court denied the\n\ndefendants' motion for stay in an order dated that day:\n\n          [O]ur denial of summary judgment turned on an\n          unresolved issue of fact in a clearly\n          established legal scenario strongly indicative\n          of improper political discrimination. Under\n          these   circumstances,   an   appeal   of   an\n          unresolved factual question is baseless and is\n          not immediately appealable.     Therefore, we\n          necessarily certify that Defendant's appeal is\n          frivolous under the present circumstances.\n\nRivera-Torres v. Ortiz-Velez, Civil No. 01-1244 at 5-6 (D.P.R.\n\nDecember 6,   2002).     Defendants    now    insist   that   \"[g]iven   the\n\nuncontested   fact     that   the    Trial     Court   proceeded   without\n\njurisdiction, the judgment entered in the instant case suffers from\n\nthe incurable vice of nullity and must be vacated.\"\n\n          This jurisdictional dispute might have been avoided if\n\nthe district court had promptly ruled on the defendants' motion to\n\ncontinue the trial pending the resolution of their Forsyth appeal.\n\nSee Fed. R. App. P. 8(a) (\"A party must ordinarily move first in\n\nthe district court for . . . a stay of the judgment or order of a\n\ndistrict court pending appeal.\").          Under well-settled law, courts\n\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\fentertaining a motion for stay are compelled to evaluate the merits\n\nof the petition and anticipate its disposition on appeal.               See\n\nAcevedo Garcia v. Vera-Monroig, 296 F.3d 13, 16 (1st Cir. 2002)\n\n(\"The sine qua non of the stay pending appeal standard is whether\n\nthe movants are likely to succeed on the merits.\") (internal\n\nquotation marks and citation omitted).         This evaluation closely\n\nresembles the frivolousness analysis required under the Apostol\n\ncertification procedure, as the court's order of December 6 noting\n\nthe unappealability of its qualified immunity ruling demonstrates.\n\nSee supra.    If the court had entered that order denying the stay on\n\nDecember 2, prior to beginning the trial, its jurisdiction over the\n\nproceedings would have been clearly established even without the\n\ninclusion of certification language in the opinion.\n\n             We have never adopted the Apostol certification procedure\n\nin this circuit.    Although appellants urge us to do so here in the\n\nhopes of adding fuel to their trial nullity argument, we decline\n\ntheir   invitation.     Whatever   the    merits   of   the   certification\n\nprocedure may be, its primary innovation -- permitting the district\n\ncourt to reclaim jurisdiction from the court of appeals in the wake\n\nof a Forsyth appeal -- has no relevance to this case.                  The\n\ndefendants' notice of appeal was patently meritless, and therefore\n\nfailed to divest the district court of jurisdiction in the first\n\ninstance.    As we observed in United States v. Brooks, 145 F.3d 446\n\n(1st Cir. 1998):\n\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\f          [l]ike most rules, the rule that either the\n          trial or the appellate court - but not both -\n          may have jurisdiction over a case at any given\n          point in time admits of some exceptions.\n          Thus,   a   district   court    can   proceed,\n          notwithstanding the filing of an appeal, if\n          the notice of appeal is defective in some\n          substantial and easily discernible way (if,\n          for example, it is based on an unappealable\n          order) or if it otherwise constitutes a\n          transparently frivolous attempt to impede the\n          progress of the case.\n\nId. at 456. In this case, the defendants' interlocutory appeal was\n\nbased on an unappealable order.   As we ruled in Stella:\n\n          a district court's pretrial rejection of a\n          qualified immunity defense is not immediately\n          appealable to the extent that it turns on\n          either an issue of fact or an issue perceived\n          by the trial court to be an issue of fact . .\n          . in such a situation, the movant must await\n          the entry of final judgment before appealing\n          the adverse ruling.\n\nStella, 63 F.3d at 74 (emphasis added).   This principle, which we\n\nreiterated in our initial order denying defendants' request for\n\nstay, rendered the district court's denial of qualified immunity\n\nunappealable.\n\n          To avoid the application of this principle, appellants\n\nnow lamely defend the legitimacy of their interlocutory appeal by\n\narguing that the district court's qualified immunity determination\n\nturned on the legal question of whether a municipal officer's\n\nsubjective intent is relevant to the qualified immunity analysis,\n\nand insisting that the court \"improperly considered the element of\n\nsubjective intent as part of the qualified immunity inquiry.\"\n\n\n\n                              -18-\n\fSuperficially, Ortiz draws support for his opposition from the\n\nSupreme Court's decision in Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U.S. 574\n\n(1998), and our post-Crawford-El jurisprudence.          See Tower v.\n\nLeslie-Brown, 326 F.3d 290, 296 (1st Cir. 2003); Abreu-Guzman v.\n\nFord, 241 F.3d 69, 73 (1st Cir. 2001) (\"Evidence concerning the\n\nofficer's subjective intent is simply irrelevant to a qualified\n\nimmunity defense.\"); Sheehy v. Town of Plymouth, 191 F.3d 15, 19\n\n(1st Cir. 1999).     To illustrate the flaw in Ortiz's argument, one\n\nmust differentiate     between   constitutional   violations   that   are\n\nstrictly a product of the perpetrator's actions, and offenses where\n\nthe perpetrator's subjective intent is an essential element of the\n\nviolation.    For example, an individual's Fourth Amendment rights\n\nare violated by the very fact that a police officer arrests him\n\nwithout probable cause, regardless of the officer's subjective\n\nintentions at the time of the arrest.      See Abreu-Guzman, 241 F.3d\n\nat 73.     Similarly, a suspect who is interrogated by the police\n\nwithout being advised of his right to counsel suffers a Fifth\n\nAmendment injury regardless of the questioning officer's intent or\n\nmotives.     In these situations, the rule of Crawford-El sensibly\n\nexcludes evidence of the officer's intent from the qualified\n\nimmunity analysis.\n\n            On the other hand, subjective intent is an essential\n\nelement of political discrimination.      We have previously observed\n\nthat\n\n\n\n                                  -19-\n\f          [w]hen a former government employee brings a\n          First Amendment suit against his employer for\n          taking an adverse employment action against\n          him on the basis of his speech, the premier\n          precedent is Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd.\n          of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274 (1977). Under\n          the Mt. Healthy paradigm, the plaintiff must\n          show both that his speech was constitutionally\n          protected, and that it was a \"substantial\" or\n          \"motivating\" factor for the adverse action\n          taken against him.\n\nStella, 63 F.3d at 74-75 (emphasis added).              In other words, an\n\nemployee's   First      Amendment    right   to   be   free   from   political\n\ndiscrimination is violated when the employer's adverse employment\n\ndecision is motivated by the employee's political speech.              Hence,\n\nthe employer's subjective motive is an essential element of the\n\nconstitutional violation itself, and          cannot be divorced from the\n\nqualified immunity inquiry.         Our previous decisions underscore the\n\nimportance   of   the    employer's     subjective     intent   in   political\n\ndiscrimination cases:\n\n          Harlow does not rule out the need to inquire\n          into the actual reasons behind an official's\n          conduct when the official's state of mind is a\n          necessary component of the constitutional\n          violation he allegedly committed . . . . [T]he\n          official's abnormal expertise in law, or his\n          subjective, below par, lack of expertise,\n          makes no difference. But determining whether\n          defendant    fired   an    employee   for    a\n          discriminatory reason . . . is an altogether\n          different matter.\n\nFeliciano-Angulo v. Rivera-Cruz, 858 F.2d 40, 45 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\nIn Acevedo-Garcia v. Vera-Monroig, 204 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2000), we\n\nsimilarly dismissed defendants' contention that subjective intent\n\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\fis   irrelevant     to    qualified      immunity,      explaining      that   \"[t]he\n\nplaintiffs allege that they were terminated because of their\n\npolitical affiliation, a constitutional claim that has no meaning\n\nabsent the allegation of impermissible motivation.\"                      Id. at 11.\n\nAccordingly, the proffered legal basis for the defendants' Forsyth\n\nappeal is meritless, having been foreclosed by our prior decisions\n\nin Feliciano-Angulo and Acevedo-Garcia, see supra, properly cited\n\nby the district court in its order denying defendants' request for\n\na stay, and characterizing the interlocutory appeal as frivolous.\n\n               Finally, we must note that the circumstances surrounding\n\nthe defendants' Forsyth appeal betray its frivolousness.                          The\n\ndistrict court's order of December 6 denying Ortiz's motion to stay\n\nthe proceedings recounts that after the defendants' motion for\n\nsummary judgment was denied on November 26, 2002, counsel for\n\ndefendants failed to appear in court on December 2, the day the\n\ntrial was scheduled to begin.             Defendants insisted that they were\n\nunable    to    proceed    because      Johanna   M.    Emmanuelli-Huertas,       the\n\ncounsel of record for defendants, was simultaneously involved in\n\nanother    trial.         The   court    rejected      this   excuse,    sanctioned\n\nEmmanuelli's law firm, and rescheduled the trial for December 3.\n\nLater that day, Ortiz filed his notice of appeal, and immediately\n\nthereafter moved to stay the proceedings in the district court,\n\nasserting to the judge that \"this Honorable Court lacks subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction to submit co-defendant Ortiz-Velez to the\n\n\n\n                                         -21-\n\frigors of trial.\"5   The timing and haste of the defendants' notice\n\nof appeal reveals its intended purpose -- to cloak a request for\n\npostponement in Forsyth interlocutory raiments.              See Apostol, 870\n\nF.2d at 1338-39 (\"Defendants may take Forsyth appeals for tactical\n\nas well as strategic reasons: disappointed by the denial of a\n\ncontinuance, they may help themselves to a postponement by lodging\n\na notice of appeal.\").\n\n           In summary, we conclude that appellants' notice of appeal\n\nnever divested the district court of jurisdiction, and we reject\n\nthe claim that the entire trial was a nullity.\n\nB.   The Trial\n\n           Defendants raise a handful of objections to the district\n\ncourt's evidentiary rulings and conduct at trial. We address these\n\nclaims in the order they were raised on appeal.\n\n1.         The District Court's Admission of Evidence Regarding\n           Dismissed Claims\n\n           Defendants   argue    that       the   district   court   erred   in\n\npermitting   the   plaintiff    to   introduce      evidence   pertaining    to\n\n\n\n     5\n      On appeal, defendants argue that they were prejudiced by the\ndistrict court's insistence on moving ahead with the trial\nnotwithstanding    attorney    Emmanuelli-Huertas's    simultaneous\nengagement. \"Attorney Martinez was faced with the daunting task of\npreparing to represent defendants at trial with less than 24 hours\nof preparation . . . . This situation put plaintiffs in an unfairly\nadvantageous position, as they were represented by the attorney who\nhandled their claims from the beginning while defendants were not.\"\nWhile we reject the merits of this argument, see infra, it plainly\nreveals the tactical considerations motivating the defendants'\nForsyth appeal.\n\n                                     -22-\n\fallegations that were dismissed before trial as time-barred.         \"In\n\ngeneral, we review judgment calls that certain evidence is either\n\nirrelevant or cumulative for abuse of discretion.\"         Yankee Candle\n\nCo., Inc. v. Bridgewater Candle Co., LLC, 259 F.3d 25, 47 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).    As noted above, the district court's grant of partial\n\nsummary judgment disposed of Rivera's claims arising from 1) the\n\nJanuary 1999 deprivation of office equipment, 2) the mayor's\n\nJanuary 1999 decision to strip Rivera of his duties and authority,\n\nand 3) Rivera's March 1999 suspension for \"disrespecting\" the vice-\n\nmayor.   Significantly, the district court's summary judgment order\n\nanticipated that evidence concerning these dismissed claims could\n\nstill be admissible at trial as relevant background:        \"Although we\n\nneed not decide the issue at this time, it is possible that the\n\ntime-barred   prior   incidents   will   be   admissible    as   relevant\n\nbackground evidence.\" Rivera-Torres v. Ortiz-Velez, Civil No. 01-\n\n1244 at 16 n.5 (D.P.R. November 26, 2002) (citing O'Rourke v. City\n\nof Providence, 235 F.3d 713, 726 (1st Cir. 2001)).          Indeed, the\n\nSupreme Court has observed that \"[a] discriminatory act which is\n\nnot made the basis for a timely charge . . . may constitute\n\nrelevant background evidence in a proceeding in which the status of\n\na current practice is at issue.\"    United Air Lines, Inc. v. Evans,\n\n431 U.S. 553, 558 (1977); see also O'Rourke, 235 F.3d at 726;\n\nMorrison v. Carleton Woolen Mills, Inc., 108 F.3d 429, 439 (1st\n\nCir. 1997).   The district court's prerogative to admit evidence of\n\n\n\n                                  -23-\n\fdismissed claims insofar as it provides relevant background for\n\nsurviving claims is firmly established by our precedents, and we\n\ndiscern no abuse of discretion in the court's exercise of this\n\nprerogative.\n\n            The    defendants    also    ground      their    objections    to   the\n\nadmissibility of \"dismissed claims\" evidence in Federal Rule of\n\nEvidence 403, arguing that \"[o]nce a jury has heard about all these\n\nalleged, and time-barred, actions taken against plaintiff . . . it\n\nbecomes    almost    impossible    to    make    a   fair     assessment    of   the\n\nsubsequent issues, which are the ones actually being tried.\"                      We\n\ndisagree.     The nature and severity of the events underlying the\n\ndismissed claims (including the confiscation of Rivera's personal\n\ntelephone, the gradual erosion of his authority, and his thirty-day\n\nsuspension) pale in significance to events that form the predicate\n\nof   his   surviving    claims    --    the    refusal   to    approve     Rivera's\n\ntransfer, and the delayed acceptance of his letter of resignation.\n\nThe dismissed claims involve employment decisions that resulted in\n\ninconvenience or brief financial hardship; the surviving claims\n\nimplicate adverse       employment      acts    that   threatened     plaintiff's\n\nlivelihood.       Accordingly, there was no abuse of discretion in the\n\ndistrict    court's     implicit       determination         that   the    unfairly\n\nprejudicial effect of this evidence did not outweigh its probative\n\nvalue.\n\n2.   Cross Examination by the Judge\n\n\n\n                                        -24-\n\f          During the cross examination of Mayor Ortiz, counsel for\n\nRivera   interrogated    the   mayor    about   why   he     insisted   on\n\ninvestigating plaintiff's sick leave absences in lieu of permitting\n\nhis transfer to a position with the Commonwealth.          In the midst of\n\nthis line of questioning, the judge interjected with several of his\n\nown questions, resulting in the following exchange between the\n\njudge and the witness:\n\n          JUDGE:         Well, there was no impediment in you giving\n                         him the transfer authorization irrespective\n                         of the investigation, correct?\n\n          WITNESS:       Well, the fact of the matter is that the\n                         investigation had reflected that there had\n                         been improper use of the sick leave days.\n                         We would have to go to the municipality's\n                         regulations regarding the possibility of a\n                         violation of those regulations or of any\n                         law. And not doing so could have entailed a\n                         finding against us by the controller's\n                         office.   It could be called negligence in\n                         the fulfillment of a supervisor's duties.\n\n          JUDGE:         But even if he had been transferred, you\n                         could always have obtained relief from him\n                         if he had taken those days for the wrong\n                         reasons?\n\n          WITNESS:       Well, at least regarding that aspect, he\n                         could have raised that matter when the\n                         letter was sent to Dr. Silva on June 25th.\n                         And then we would have consulted the\n                         attorney himself . . . or from OCALAR, which\n                         is the personnel agency for the Commonwealth\n                         which deals with these personnel affairs.\n                         And if they said this was okay, we would\n                         have issued the letter.\n\n          JUDGE:         At this time when these things were\n                         happening had he already changed parties?\n\n\n\n\n                                 -25-\n\f            WITNESS:        Yes, he was already a candidate.         This was\n                            the year 2000.\n\n            JUDGE:          Don't you think it would have been prudent\n                            to allow him to go to the Commonwealth and\n                            out of Sabana Grande so that you wouldn't\n                            have any more problems with him?\n\n            WITNESS:        If we were to look at it from that point of\n                            view, it would have been beneficial for the\n                            municipality because we then would have had\n                            a regular position that we could have\n                            filled. But the problem was that since he\n                            was under investigation we could not do so.\n\n            On appeal, defendants argue that\n\n            this grilling of codefendant Ortiz, far from\n            aiding the jury in understanding the evidence,\n            was a cross examination, comprised mostly of\n            leading and argumentative questions geared\n            towards making the following point: the Mayor\n            had no legal basis for denying plaintiff's\n            transfer, this action was carried out while\n            plaintiff was a candidate for Mayor, and\n            defendant was not prudent in making this\n            decision.\n\nThe Federal    Rules    of   Evidence     provide   that   \"[t]he   court   may\n\ninterrogate witnesses, whether called by itself or by a party.\"\n\nFed. R. Evid. 614(b); see also United States v. Gonzalez-Soberal,\n\n109 F.3d 64, 72 (1st Cir. 1997) (\"It is well settled that the trial\n\njudge has a perfect right -- albeit a right that should be\n\nexercised   with     care   --   to   participate   actively   in   the   trial\n\nproper.\"). The judge's discretion to participate in the direct and\n\ncross examination of witnesses is cabined by the importance of\n\nmaintaining an appearance of impartiality:\n\n            There are, however, limits to the behavior\n            that is permitted judges.  For example, the\n\n\n                                       -26-\n\f          judge's participation must be balanced; he\n          cannot become an advocate or otherwise use his\n          judicial powers to advantage or disadvantage a\n          party unfairly. An inquiry into the judge's\n          conduct of the trial necessarily turns on the\n          question of whether the complaining party can\n          show serious prejudice.\n\nId. (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).\n\n          On the cold record before us, the district court's\n\nquestions suggest some skepticism about the mayor's proffered\n\njustification for denying Rivera's transfer. Ideally, the district\n\ncourt should have avoided this suggestion.     However, given the\n\nbrevity of the exchange and the mild nature of the questioning, we\n\nconclude that the district court's interjections did not result in\n\n\"serious prejudice.\" Id. Furthermore, we find it significant that\n\nthe judge issued a lengthy instruction to the jury that mitigated\n\nany prejudice arising from his interrogation of Ortiz.\n\n          If I asked any questions, and I did ask\n          questions in this case, which it is my duty to\n          do so if I have to, you should not be\n          influenced by anything that I said or did.\n          The purpose of asking questions by me was to\n          either highlight something that I thought was\n          unclear from the evidence, something that was\n          not developed by the lawyers that I thought\n          should be developed or simply to give some\n          perspective to the actual issue before the\n          Court at that time.\n\n          Judges, federal judges, have the right to ask\n          questions.    They have the right to call\n          witnesses.   They have the right to actually\n          comment into [sic] the evidence if they want\n          to comment on the evidence.     And there is\n          nothing wrong with that. The important thing\n          is that I am not here to lead you into any\n          particular result. I am here to just try to\n\n\n                              -27-\n\f              give you, with the assistance of the lawyer,\n              the presentation of the best evidence possible\n              so that you can decide the issues of fact.\n\n(emphasis added).            We have previously held that instructions of\n\nthis nature may cure prejudice arising from a judge's active trial\n\nparticipation: \"[A]ny possible risk of prejudice to [defendant] as\n\na    result     of   the   judge's     questions      was   abated    by   the     clear\n\ninstruction to the jury that it should ignore any impression that\n\nhis questions might have made on them.\"                 United States v. Henry,\n\n136 F.3d 12, 19 (1st Cir. 1998); see also Van Leirsburg v. Sioux\n\nValley Hosp., 831 F.2d 169, 173 (8th Cir. 1987).                      In the end, we\n\nconclude that the district court's questioning of Ortiz did not\n\ngive rise to reversible error.\n\n3.    Judicial Notice\n\n              At trial, the defense attempted to characterize the\n\nCommonwealth job for which Rivera sought a transfer as a \"demotion\"\n\nfrom his        tenured    position    with     the   municipality.        While     the\n\nCommonwealth position was designated a \"transitory,\" or temporary\n\nposition, Rivera testified on cross examination that he stood to\n\nreceive tenure from the Commonwealth after he had held the new\n\nposition      for    \"some    months.\"     To    counter     the     impact   of    this\n\ntestimony, the defendants asked the district court to take judicial\n\nnotice     of    the   fact     that    under    Puerto     Rico     law   transitory\n\nappointments may not be converted into tenured appointments.                         The\n\njudge, however, rejected defense counsel's request:\n\n\n\n                                         -28-\n\f            I can't take judicial notice of that for a\n            reason. I have been dealing with this kind of\n            case for over 16 years. And believe me, there\n            are many instances in which a situation like\n            this where the Puerto Rico government takes a\n            person like this and takes a transitory\n            position, puts the person in and down the road\n            in two or three months they change it to a\n            career position. That happens all the time .\n            . . . It may be illegal. But I live in the\n            real world.   In the real world this happens\n            every day in the Puerto Rico government. And\n            this is -- this has been established by the\n            case law. You have thousands of examples and\n            there is no way I am going to instruct this\n            jury about something that is not realistic.\n\n            Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, \"[a] judicially\n\nnoticed fact must be one not subject to reasonable dispute in that\n\nit   is   either    (1)   generally     known   within    the    territorial\n\njurisdiction of the trial court, or (2) capable of accurate and\n\nready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot\n\nreasonably be questioned.\"      Fed. R. Evid. 201(b)(emphasis added).\n\nThe district court is obligated to take judicial notice of such\n\nfacts \"if requested by a party and supplied with the necessary\n\ninformation.\"      Fed. R. Evid. 201(d).     Here the court, drawing upon\n\nits experience, determined that the fact offered for judicial\n\nnotice did not fulfill the requirements of Rule 201(b) because\n\nPuerto Rico law governing the duration of \"transitory\" government\n\nappointments    does   not   always    correspond   to   the    realities   of\n\ngovernment practice.         Therefore, in the court's view, taking\n\njudicial notice of the letter of the law would have misled the\n\njury.     On appeal, defendants offer no persuasive rationale for\n\n\n                                      -29-\n\freversing the court's reasonable application of Rule 201, and we\n\ndecline to disturb the jury verdict on this ground.6\n\n4.    Refusal to Continue Proceedings\n\n            Finally, defendants argue that the district court abused\n\nits discretion in refusing to continue the proceedings to avoid a\n\ntrial conflict involving the defendants' counsel of record.           See\n\nMacaulay v. Anas, 321 F.3d 45, 48 (1st Cir. 2003).             The record\n\nreflects that both parties filed a joint pre-trial memorandum on\n\nJuly 21, 2002, and that the pre-trial conference was approved by\n\nthe district court on July 31, 2002.            On August 1, 2002, the\n\ndistrict court docketed its order setting December 2, 2002 as the\n\nstarting date of the trial.      Attorney Emmanuelli's law firm, which\n\nemploys fifteen attorneys, accordingly had four months' notice of\n\nthe trial date, and four months to bring another attorney up to\n\nspeed on the specifics of this case.          Instead, Emmanuelli waited\n\nuntil the day the trial was scheduled to begin to move the court\n\nfor   a   continuance   citing   an    irreconcilable   conflict.   These\n\ncircumstances preclude any finding that the district court abused\n\nits discretion in denying the continuance.\n\n\n      6\n      Defendants cursorily argue that the district court erred in\nadmitting tape recordings of disparaging statements about plaintiff\nmade by Ortiz during his election campaign. They intimate that the\ntapes were not properly authenticated, but provide no developed\nanalysis or legal authority to support their assertion.\nAccordingly, we deem the argument waived. See United States v.\nZannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"[I]ssues adverted to in\na perfunctory fashion, unaccompanied by some effort at developed\nargumentation, are deemed waived.\").\n\n                                      -30-\n\fC.   Post-Trial Rulings\n\n1.   Damages\n\n           At the conclusion of the trial, the jury awarded Rivera\n\nand his family the following damages: 1) $60,000 to Rivera for lost\n\nwages and benefits; 2) $125,000 in compensatory damages to Rivera\n\n\"for emotional pain and mental anguish\" (pain and suffering); 3)\n\n$75,000 in compensatory damages to Rivera's wife for pain and\n\nsuffering;     4)    $30,000   in   compensatory    damages      to   each   of\n\nplaintiff's daughters for pain and suffering; and 5) $250,000 in\n\npunitive damages to Rivera alone.         Hence, the jury's award of back\n\npay was the only component of the damage award compensating an\n\neconomic injury.       In a post-trial order, the district court sua\n\nsponte reduced this element of the damages from $60,000 to $26,400,\n\nruling that \"the verdict has to be adjusted on the issue of lost\n\nwages because the only evidence is lost wages.                   There is no\n\nevidence of loss of benefits.\"            Plaintiffs do not contest the\n\ncourt's reduction of this award on appeal.\n\n             Where defendants properly preserve a challenge to the\n\namount of compensatory damages awarded by the jury, \"our inquiry is\n\nlimited   to   determining     'whether    the   trial   court    abused     its\n\ndiscretion in refusing to set aside the verdict as excessive.'\"\n\nAnthony v. G.M.D. Airline Servs., Inc., 17 F.3d 490, 493 (1st Cir.\n\n1994) (quoting McDonald v. Fed. Labs., Inc. 724 F.2d 243, 246 (1st\n\nCir. 1984)).        The review of a preserved challenge to a punitive\n\n\n                                    -31-\n\fdamages award \"is de novo, and the award will stand unless we find\n\nit 'certain' that the amount in question exceeds that necessary to\n\npunish and deter the alleged misconduct.\"               Romano v. U-Haul Int'l,\n\n233 F.3d 655, 672 (1st Cir. 2000).              In this case, however, Ortiz\n\nand the municipality did not move for a new trial after the jury\n\ndelivered its verdict, or file a post-trial motion to reduce or set\n\naside the verdict as excessive.           We have long held that defendants\n\nwho fail to preserve challenges to the jury verdict below forfeit\n\nreview of those claims on appeal: \"We generally will not review a\n\nparty's     contention    that    the    damages     award   is   excessive    or\n\ninsufficient where the party has failed to allow the district court\n\nto rule on the matter.\"          O'Connor v. Huard, 117 F.3d 12, 18 (1st\n\nCir. 1997); see Carlton v. H.C. Price Co., 640 F.2d 573, 577 (5th\n\nCir.   1981)   (no   appellate      review      of   allegedly    excessive    or\n\ninadequate damages available where trial court was not given the\n\nopportunity to exercise its discretion on the matter), cited with\n\napproval in Wells Real Estate, Inc. v. Greater Lowell Bd. of\n\nRealtors,    850   F.2d   803,    811    (1st    Cir.    1988);   Braunstein   v.\n\nMassachusetts Bank & Trust Co., 443 F.2d 1281, 1285 (1st Cir. 1971)\n\n(denying review of claim that award was excessive because appellant\n\nfailed to raise the issue before the district court).\n\n            In this circuit, claims \"forfeit[ed] through ignorance or\n\nneglect\" may still be subject to plain error review on appeal.\n\nChestnut v. City of Lowell, 305 F.3d 18, 20 (1st Cir. 2002) (en\n\n\n\n                                        -32-\n\fbanc) (\"Failures to object, unless a true waiver is involved, are\n\nalmost always subject to review for plain error.\"). However, after\n\nreviewing the record, we discern no plain error that \"resulted in\n\na miscarriage of justice or seriously affected the fairness,\n\nintegrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\"\n\nSmith v. Kmart Corp., 177 F.3d 19, 28 (1st Cir. 1999).   The jury's\n\naward of compensatory damages was amply supported by the record,\n\nparticularly the trial testimony of Daisy Nazario-Santana (Rivera's\n\nwife), Yasira Rivera-Nazario (Rivera's elder daughter), and Zahira\n\nRivera-Nazario (Rivera's younger daughter), as well as Rivera's own\n\ndescription of the mental and emotional suffering he endured after\n\nlosing his job.    The jury's punitive damage award was also well\n\nwithin acceptable bounds, given the reprehensibility of defendants'\n\nconduct and the resultant injuries inflicted on Rivera and his\n\nfamily.   See State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell, 123 S. Ct.\n\n1513, 1520-21 (2003); BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.S.\n\n559, 574-76 (1996).\n\n2.   Municipal Liability\n\n           Question #1 on the special verdict form asked the jurors\n\nto determine whether \"the actions of the defendant were under the\n\ncolor of the authority of the state.\"    The jury responded in the\n\naffirmative.    Question #9 then inquired whether \"the claimed\n\nunconstitutional conduct of the mayor as a higher authority was\n\ndone pursuant to the policy of the municipality of Sabana Grande.\"\n\n\n                                -33-\n\fThe jury responded to this question in the negative.            Initially\n\nlimiting its focus to Question #9, the court remarked after hearing\n\nthe verdict in its entirety that \"According to [the special verdict\n\nform] the municipality did not have a policy.              This thing was\n\nbasically the mayor's thing. And I will then enter the appropriate\n\njudgment [in favor of the municipality].\"\n\n             Upon   further   reflection,   the   court,   citing   to   our\n\ndecision in Cordero v. De Jesus-Mendez, 867 F.2d 1 (1st Cir. 1989),\n\ndetermined that it had erred in including Question #9 on the\n\nspecial verdict form.         In Cordero, we acknowledged the Supreme\n\nCourt's holding in Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati, 475 U.S. 469\n\n(1986) that \"municipality liability under § 1983 attaches where .\n\n. . a deliberate choice to follow a course of action is made from\n\namong various alternatives by the official or officials responsible\n\nfor establishing final policy with respect to the subject matter in\n\nquestion.\"     Id. at 483-84 (emphasis added).        The Cordero court\n\nsubsequently noted that mayors in Puerto Rico are the government\n\nofficials ultimately responsible for the employment decisions of\n\nthe municipality:\n\n             Under Puerto Rico law, one of the express\n             powers given to mayors of municipalities is:\n             \"To appoint all the officials and employees of\n             the municipal executive branch, and remove\n             them from office whenever necessary for the\n             good   of  the service,     pursuant  to   the\n             procedures provided herein.\" P.R. Laws Ann.\n             tit. 21, ch. 155 § 3002(15) (1980).\n\n\n\n\n                                   -34-\n\fId. at 7. Hence, Mayor Ortiz's employment decisions in the context\n\nof this case ipso facto \"constituted the official policy of the\n\nmunicipality.\"       Id.     Therefore, as the district court correctly\n\nrealized, the liability of the municipality could not be divorced\n\nfrom the mayor's liability in his official capacity.                     Because the\n\njury   expressly     found    in     response     to     Question   #1    that     \"the\n\n[unlawful] actions of the defendant were under the color of the\n\nauthority    of    the     state,\"     municipal       liability      automatically\n\nattached.\n\n            We applaud the district court's prompt efforts to cure\n\nits initial error, and affirm its decision to disregard Question #9\n\non   the   special   verdict       form    and    enter    judgment      against    the\n\nmunicipality.      Significantly, the jury's responses to Question #1\n\nand Question #9 did not create an inconsistent verdict to be\n\nresolved in accordance with Rule 49 of the Federal Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure.    Fed. R. Civ. P. 49.          The jury's response to Question #9\n\nreflected    its     determination         that    the     municipality      had     no\n\nfreestanding laws or policies that allowed or encouraged the\n\nadverse employment decisions at issue.                 This determination was in\n\nno way inconsistent with its previous finding that the mayor,\n\nacting on his own initiative, discriminated against Rivera while\n\ndischarging his duties as mayor.                  In the absence of a proper\n\ninstruction, the jurors were unaware that Ortiz's actions as mayor\n\nwere themselves the \"policy\" of the municipality.                        Given these\n\n\n\n                                          -35-\n\fcircumstances, the district court's decision to disregard the\n\njury's response to Question #9 is in accord with our resolution of\n\nthe identical problem in Cordero, see Cordero, 867 F.2d at 8, and\n\ndid not unfairly prejudice the municipality.\n\n            We reiterate that the municipality's contention that\n\n\"[t]here is no evidence in the record, suggestive of the Mayor\n\nimplementing any sort of municipal policy,\" simply misses the\n\npoint.   Ortiz had the authority to control the conditions of\n\nRivera's employment by virtue of being the Mayor of Sabana Grande.\n\nThe employment decisions he made in that capacity constituted the\n\npolicy of the municipality under well-established precedent.             See\n\nPembaur, 475 U.S. at 483; Cordero, 867 F.2d at 7.\n\n                                III.\n\n            Our exhaustive review of the record and the arguments\n\nraised on    appeal   reveals   no   basis   for   disturbing   the   jury's\n\nliability determination or damage awards.           The district court's\n\nentry of judgment on the verdict is affirmed.\n\n            So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -36-\n\f",

On February 21, 2001, plaintiffs\n\nSantos Rivera-Torres (\"Rivera\"), his wife (Daisy Nazario-Santana),\n\nand   two   daughters    (Yasira      Rivera-Nazario     and     Zahira   Rivera-\n\nNazario),1 brought this claim against the municipality of Sabana\n\nGrande and four municipal officers pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n\nRivera alleged that he was the victim of adverse employment actions\n\nmotivated by political animus, in violation of the First and\n\nFourteenth Amendments.           After a series of preliminary orders\n\nremoving three of the four individual defendants from the action,\n\nthe trial began on December 3, 2002, against the municipality of\n\nSabana Grande and Miguel Ortiz Velez (\"Ortiz\"), the mayor of Sabana\n\nGrande,     who   was   sued    in    both    his   individual    and     official\n\ncapacities.       At the conclusion of the four-day trial, the jury\n\nfound that \"protected political activity was a substantial or\n\nmotivating    factor    in     the   defendant's    decision     to   politically\n\ndiscriminate against the plaintiff,\" and awarded Rivera $60,000 in\n\nlost wages and benefits,2 $125,000 in compensatory damages, and\n\n$250,000 in punitive damages.           The jury also awarded compensatory\n\ndamages in the amount of $75,000 to plaintiff's wife, and $30,000\n\n\n\n      1\n      Because the claims brought by Rivera's wife and two daughters\nare derivative of Rivera's political discrimination claim, we\ndesignate Rivera the \"plaintiff\" and refer to the other co-\nplaintiffs by name where necessary.\n      2\n      After the jury issued its verdict, the court sua sponte\nreduced the award for lost wages and benefits from $60,000 to\n$26,400. Rivera does not contest this reduction on appeal.\n\n                                        -2-\n\fto each of plaintiff's daughters.             With several alterations, the\n\ncourt entered judgment on the jury's verdict, and the defendants\n\nfiled these timely appeals.\n\n           Defendants      raise   a     plethora   of   objections    to   the\n\nproceedings below, challenging inter alia the court's denial of\n\nqualified immunity, its refusal to stay proceedings pending the\n\nresolution     of   an     attempted      interlocutory      appeal,    various\n\nevidentiary rulings at trial, the court's interrogation of a\n\ndefense witness, and the validity of the jury's damage award.\n\nAfter    careful    review    of   the    record,   we    reject   defendants'\n\nchallenges and affirm the judgment.\n\n                                         I.\n\n             In 1980, Rivera was hired by the mayor of Sabana Grande\n\nto work in various capacities at the municipal gym.3               Plaintiff's\n\nduties included training boxers and weight lifters, teaching self-\n\ndefense   classes    for     children,    and   organizing   weight    lifting,\n\nboxing, gymnastics, and karate competitions at locations around\n\nSabana Grande.       Most municipal jobs in Puerto Rico are sub-\n\nclassified as \"career positions\" (akin to civil service jobs) or\n\n\"trust positions\" (political appointments).              Municipal employees\n\nare similarly designated \"career\" or \"trust\" employees.                 At all\n\ntimes, Rivera was a career employee, and his job was designated a\n\n\n     3\n      The facts presented here are intended to convey a general\nimpression of the case. We provide additional facts where they are\npertinent to the legal analysis.\n\n                                       -3-\n\fcareer position.      In 1992, twelve years after plaintiff was hired,\n\nthe    incumbent    mayor   promoted    him     to   \"be   in    charge   of   the\n\ngymnasium.\"      Although this managerial post was originally a \"trust\n\nposition,\" the municipality reclassified it as a career job to\n\nfacilitate plaintiff's promotion.\n\n            At the time of the promotion, Rivera was a member of the\n\nPopular Democratic Party (\"PDP\"), though his allegiances were\n\ngradually shifting to the New Progressive Party (\"NPP\").                  Over the\n\nnext six years, from 1992 to 1998, Rivera's tenure as manager of\n\nthe municipal gym was uneventful, and the record indicates that he\n\nreceived only positive employment evaluations.                In December 1998,\n\nplaintiff formally joined the NPP, and local party leaders asked\n\nhim to run as the NPP candidate for mayor of Sabana Grande.                    One\n\nweek    later,   plaintiff   publicly        accepted   the     party's   mayoral\n\nnomination at an NPP \"plebiscite\" (caucus).\n\n            Rivera's candidacy created a potentially awkward work\n\nenvironment.       His opponent in the mayoral election was incumbent\n\nmayor Miguel Ortiz Velez, who also happened to be plaintiff's boss\n\nby virtue of being mayor.         Rivera testified at trial that his\n\nrelationship with Ortiz changed dramatically after he announced his\n\ncandidacy. That month, after returning from a three-week vacation,\n\nplaintiff discovered that the telephone had been removed from his\n\noffice in the gymnasium.       Rivera also learned that the mayor was\n\nrequesting daily reports on his work habits from other coworkers\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fstationed at the gym.     In March 1999, the mayor observed Rivera\n\noutside his \"area\" during working hours, and ordered his secretary\n\nto make notations on plaintiff's time card documenting his absence\n\nfrom work.     When plaintiff confronted the vice-mayor of Sabana\n\nGrande over the incident, he received a thirty-day suspension for\n\n\"being disrespectful to the vice-mayor.\"             Rivera appealed this\n\nsuspension to the Commonwealth's Board of Appeals for the Personnel\n\nAdministration System (\"JASAP\"), which reversed his suspension and\n\nawarded Rivera thirty days' back pay.          The Board's decision was\n\naffirmed on appeal to the Commonwealth's Court of Appeals, and the\n\nPuerto Rico Supreme Court denied certiorari.\n\n          In   the   aftermath   of    the   JASAP   proceedings,   Rivera\n\ncontinued to experience harassment at work.          The locks on the gym\n\nwere changed to inhibit his access, and on one occasion Rivera\n\nfound a stack of his personal and office documents torn up next to\n\na trash can near his office.          He was stripped of authority to\n\ndirect the activities of subordinates at the gym, and he had\n\nseveral prolonged arguments with Ortiz at the gymnasium.            On one\n\noccasion, the mayor ordered him to complete maintenance tasks that\n\nwere not within the scope of his duties.         The defendants did not\n\nseriously dispute these incidents at trial.\n\n          In May 2000, Rivera sought and received an offer of\n\nstate-level employment at the Commonwealth Department of Sports and\n\nRecreation in nearby Mayaguez.     At the time, the head of the Sport\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fAdministration Department was Eric Labrador, a fellow member of the\n\nNPP.     Because    Puerto     Rico     law   prohibits     individuals    from\n\nsimultaneously holding state and municipal-level employment, Rivera\n\npetitioned the municipality for a transfer.               However, Mayor Ortiz\n\nrefused to approve Rivera's transfer.              Rivera testified that the\n\nmayor's secretary informed him that \"the mayor would not sign\n\nunimportant papers.\"\n\n            Rivera was anxious to accept the state-level position\n\nbefore   the   November      2000     elections,     anticipating   that    the\n\nemployment offer would be rescinded if a PDP administration were\n\nelected into    office.      Thus, on June 5, 2000, Rivera submitted an\n\nirrevocable    letter   of    resignation     to    the   municipality.     The\n\nconsequences of resigning in lieu of obtaining a transfer were\n\nsevere. Plaintiff stood to sacrifice the twenty years of seniority\n\nhe had accumulated since 1980 for salary and benefit purposes.\n\nHowever, even this initiative proved unavailing when Ortiz refused\n\nto accept Rivera's resignation, citing an ongoing investigation\n\ninto Rivera's excessive absenteeism over the previous five months.\n\nMayor Ortiz testified at trial that under Puerto Rico law, a\n\nmunicipality loses the authority to discipline a municipal employee\n\nonce that employee has been transferred to a state agency.                Hence,\n\nit was critical to delay plaintiff's transfer request until the\n\nadministrative     investigation       into   his    absenteeism    had     been\n\nresolved.\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\f            Rivera insisted that his absences were due to work-\n\nrelated illnesses, and he instructed his doctor, Silva Cherena, to\n\nsubmit    medical    reports     to   the   municipality    documenting   his\n\nsymptoms.        Indeed,   Dr.   Cherena    had   sent   plaintiff's   medical\n\ninformation to the municipality on July 1, 2000.              However, Mayor\n\nOrtiz's office claimed not to have received the doctor's letter\n\nuntil October 31, 2000.           Two weeks later, Mayor Ortiz finally\n\naccepted Rivera's irrevocable resignation, nearly five-and-a-half\n\nmonths after it was tendered.          In the intervening period, the NPP\n\nparty had been voted out of key Commonwealth positions, and the job\n\noffer at the Commonwealth Department of Sports and Recreation was\n\nno longer available.       Rivera was unable to find other work, and his\n\nfamily suffered significant financial and emotional hardship as a\n\nresult.\n\n            In the opinion accompanying its November 26, 2002 order\n\ngranting partial summary judgment to defendants, the district court\n\ndistilled Rivera's accusations into five discrete allegations of\n\npolitical discrimination:\n\n            1)       In January 1999, Defendants removed the phone\n                     from Plaintiff's office;\n\n            2)       In January 1999, Defendant Ortiz ordered Arenas,\n                     another employee of the Municipality, to take on\n                     Plaintiff's job duties, supervise Plaintiff, and\n                     track his movements;\n\n            3)       In March 1999, Defendants falsely accused and\n                     unjustly suspended Plaintiff for leaving his\n                     work-area and being absent from work;\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f            4)        In April 2000, Defendant Ortiz refused to approve\n                      Plaintiff's transfer to the Commonwealth's Sports\n                      and Recreation Department in Mayaguez;\n\n            5)        On June 28, 2000, Defendant Ortiz declined to\n                      accept   Plaintiff's    resignation   and then\n                      intentionally deferred the decision, accepting\n                      the resignation only after the elections.\n\nThe    defendants     conceded     that    Rivera         had   properly    preserved\n\nallegations 4 and 5, but argued that the first three allegations\n\nwere    time-barred.        The   district        court    agreed,    and   dismissed\n\nallegations 1, 2 and 3 in its partial order of summary judgment on\n\nNovember 26, 2000.          Of particular relevance to this case, the\n\ndistrict court's November 26 order also denied Mayor Ortiz's\n\nrequest for qualified immunity.                  On December 3, 2002, the case\n\nproceeded    to     trial   on    Rivera's       two   preserved      allegations    of\n\ndiscrimination. The jury delivered its verdict on December 9, and\n\nthese appeals followed.\n\n                                          II.\n\nA.     Pre-Trial Rulings\n\n1.     Denial of Summary Judgment\n\n             The    defendants     level     a    three-pronged       attack   on    the\n\ndistrict court's failure to dismiss Rivera's case outright on\n\nsummary judgment. First, they argue that \"the determination of the\n\nCourt that plaintiffs had made out a prima facie case rested on\n\nevidence     that    was    ultimately       inadmissible        at   trial    and    on\n\ninferences from facts not properly on the summary judgment record.\"\n\nSee Finn v.

Finally,\n\ndefendants challenge the district court's denial of qualified\n\nimmunity at the summary judgment stage.\n\n              These objections are unavailing.          Because the appeal in\n\nthis case follows a full trial and verdict, the district court's\n\nrulings at the summary judgment stage were \"overtaken by subsequent\n\nevents\":\n\n              We need not address the merits of [a]\n              preverdict challenge to the sufficiency of the\n              evidence on the motion for summary judgment.\n              Such an attack on the denial of defendant's\n              motion   for  summary   judgment   \"has   been\n              overtaken by subsequent events, namely, a\n              full-dress trial and an adverse jury verdict\"\n              . . . . The rationale for this rule has been\n              based on the procedural fact that a denial of\n              a motion for summary judgment \"is merely a\n              judge's determination that genuine issues of\n              material fact exist.   It is not a judgment,\n              and does not foreclose trial on issues on\n              which summary judgment was sought.\" Hence, a\n              challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence\n              adduced on the motion to support the district\n              court's conclusion that genuine issues of\n              material fact exist will not lie on appeal.\n\nEastern Mountain Platform Tennis, Inc. v.

For one thing, an order denying\n              summary judgment typically does not merge into\n              the final judgment and therefore is not an\n              independently appealable event if the case\n              thereafter proceeds to trial.\n\nId. at 22 (citing Eastern Mountain, 40 F.3d at 497).\n\n              Consequently, although a post-trial grant of immunity\n\nwould still confer a benefit on defendants by shielding them from\n\nany liability for monetary damages awarded by the jury, a defendant\n\ndetermined     to   persist   in   challenging    the   court's   denial   of\n\nqualified immunity cannot rest on the objection lodged at the\n\nsummary judgment stage, but must move for judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw at the conclusion of the trial.           If the court adheres to its\n\noriginal position, the defendant may then appeal from the denial of\n\njudgment as a matter of law.       A contrary rule would contradict the\n\nprinciple enshrined in our jurisprudence that facts elicited at\n\ntrial   are    often   probative   of   the   defendant's   entitlement    to\n\nqualified immunity.

In\n          denying   appellants'   motion   for   summary\n          judgment based on qualified immunity, the\n          district court stated that \"Ortiz's motivation\n          for   denying   and    deferring   Plaintiff's\n          resignation is an unresolved issue of material\n          fact.\"    As appellants have not adequately\n          explained why the denial is immediately\n          appealable, see Stella v.

If the court had entered that order denying the stay on\n\nDecember 2, prior to beginning the trial, its jurisdiction over the\n\nproceedings would have been clearly established even without the\n\ninclusion of certification language in the opinion.\n\n             We have never adopted the Apostol certification procedure\n\nin this circuit.

For example, an individual's Fourth Amendment rights\n\nare violated by the very fact that a police officer arrests him\n\nwithout probable cause, regardless of the officer's subjective\n\nintentions at the time of the arrest.      See Abreu-Guzman, 241 F.3d\n\nat 73.     Similarly, a suspect who is interrogated by the police\n\nwithout being advised of his right to counsel suffers a Fifth\n\nAmendment injury regardless of the questioning officer's intent or\n\nmotives.     In these situations, the rule of Crawford-El sensibly\n\nexcludes evidence of the officer's intent from the qualified\n\nimmunity analysis.\n\n            On the other hand, subjective intent is an essential\n\nelement of political discrimination.      We have previously observed\n\nthat\n\n\n\n                                  -19-\n\f          [w]hen a former government employee brings a\n          First Amendment suit against his employer for\n          taking an adverse employment action against\n          him on the basis of his speech, the premier\n          precedent is Mt.

Under\n          the Mt. Healthy paradigm, the plaintiff must\n          show both that his speech was constitutionally\n          protected, and that it was a \"substantial\" or\n          \"motivating\" factor for the adverse action\n          taken against him.\n\nStella, 63 F.3d at 74-75 (emphasis added).              In other words, an\n\nemployee's   First      Amendment    right   to   be   free   from   political\n\ndiscrimination is violated when the employer's adverse employment\n\ndecision is motivated by the employee's political speech.              Hence,\n\nthe employer's subjective motive is an essential element of the\n\nconstitutional violation itself, and          cannot be divorced from the\n\nqualified immunity inquiry.         Our previous decisions underscore the\n\nimportance   of   the    employer's     subjective     intent   in   political\n\ndiscrimination cases:\n\n          Harlow does not rule out the need to inquire\n          into the actual reasons behind an official's\n          conduct when the official's state of mind is a\n          necessary component of the constitutional\n          violation he allegedly committed . . . . [T]he\n          official's abnormal expertise in law, or his\n          subjective, below par, lack of expertise,\n          makes no difference. But determining whether\n          defendant    fired   an    employee   for    a\n          discriminatory reason . . . is an altogether\n          different matter.\n\nFeliciano-Angulo v.

The\n\ndistrict court's order of December 6 denying Ortiz's motion to stay\n\nthe proceedings recounts that after the defendants' motion for\n\nsummary judgment was denied on November 26, 2002, counsel for\n\ndefendants failed to appear in court on December 2, the day the\n\ntrial was scheduled to begin.             Defendants insisted that they were\n\nunable    to    proceed    because      Johanna   M.    Emmanuelli-Huertas,       the\n\ncounsel of record for defendants, was simultaneously involved in\n\nanother    trial.         The   court    rejected      this   excuse,    sanctioned\n\nEmmanuelli's law firm, and rescheduled the trial for December 3.\n\nLater that day, Ortiz filed his notice of appeal, and immediately\n\nthereafter moved to stay the proceedings in the district court,\n\nasserting to the judge that \"this Honorable Court lacks subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction to submit co-defendant Ortiz-Velez to the\n\n\n\n                                         -21-\n\frigors of trial.\"5   The timing and haste of the defendants' notice\n\nof appeal reveals its intended purpose -- to cloak a request for\n\npostponement in Forsyth interlocutory raiments.              See Apostol, 870\n\nF.2d at 1338-39 (\"Defendants may take Forsyth appeals for tactical\n\nas well as strategic reasons: disappointed by the denial of a\n\ncontinuance, they may help themselves to a postponement by lodging\n\na notice of appeal.\").\n\n           In summary, we conclude that appellants' notice of appeal\n\nnever divested the district court of jurisdiction, and we reject\n\nthe claim that the entire trial was a nullity.\n\nB.   The Trial\n\n           Defendants raise a handful of objections to the district\n\ncourt's evidentiary rulings and conduct at trial. We address these\n\nclaims in the order they were raised on appeal.\n\n1.         The District Court's Admission of Evidence Regarding\n           Dismissed Claims\n\n           Defendants   argue    that       the   district   court   erred   in\n\npermitting   the   plaintiff    to   introduce      evidence   pertaining    to\n\n\n\n     5\n      On appeal, defendants argue that they were prejudiced by the\ndistrict court's insistence on moving ahead with the trial\nnotwithstanding    attorney    Emmanuelli-Huertas's    simultaneous\nengagement. \"Attorney Martinez was faced with the daunting task of\npreparing to represent defendants at trial with less than 24 hours\nof preparation . . . . This situation put plaintiffs in an unfairly\nadvantageous position, as they were represented by the attorney who\nhandled their claims from the beginning while defendants were not.\"\nWhile we reject the merits of this argument, see infra, it plainly\nreveals the tactical considerations motivating the defendants'\nForsyth appeal.\n\n                                     -22-\n\fallegations that were dismissed before trial as time-barred.         \"In\n\ngeneral, we review judgment calls that certain evidence is either\n\nirrelevant or cumulative for abuse of discretion.\"         Yankee Candle\n\nCo., Inc. v.

Significantly, the district court's summary judgment order\n\nanticipated that evidence concerning these dismissed claims could\n\nstill be admissible at trial as relevant background:        \"Although we\n\nneed not decide the issue at this time, it is possible that the\n\ntime-barred   prior   incidents   will   be   admissible    as   relevant\n\nbackground evidence.\" Rivera-Torres v.

The district court's prerogative to admit evidence of\n\n\n\n                                  -23-\n\fdismissed claims insofar as it provides relevant background for\n\nsurviving claims is firmly established by our precedents, and we\n\ndiscern no abuse of discretion in the court's exercise of this\n\nprerogative.\n\n            The    defendants    also    ground      their    objections    to   the\n\nadmissibility of \"dismissed claims\" evidence in Federal Rule of\n\nEvidence 403, arguing that \"[o]nce a jury has heard about all these\n\nalleged, and time-barred, actions taken against plaintiff . . . it\n\nbecomes    almost    impossible    to    make    a   fair     assessment    of   the\n\nsubsequent issues, which are the ones actually being tried.\"                      We\n\ndisagree.     The nature and severity of the events underlying the\n\ndismissed claims (including the confiscation of Rivera's personal\n\ntelephone, the gradual erosion of his authority, and his thirty-day\n\nsuspension) pale in significance to events that form the predicate\n\nof   his   surviving    claims    --    the    refusal   to    approve     Rivera's\n\ntransfer, and the delayed acceptance of his letter of resignation.\n\nThe dismissed claims involve employment decisions that resulted in\n\ninconvenience or brief financial hardship; the surviving claims\n\nimplicate adverse       employment      acts    that   threatened     plaintiff's\n\nlivelihood.       Accordingly, there was no abuse of discretion in the\n\ndistrict    court's     implicit       determination         that   the    unfairly\n\nprejudicial effect of this evidence did not outweigh its probative\n\nvalue.\n\n2.   Cross Examination by the Judge\n\n\n\n                                        -24-\n\f          During the cross examination of Mayor Ortiz, counsel for\n\nRivera   interrogated    the   mayor    about   why   he     insisted   on\n\ninvestigating plaintiff's sick leave absences in lieu of permitting\n\nhis transfer to a position with the Commonwealth.          In the midst of\n\nthis line of questioning, the judge interjected with several of his\n\nown questions, resulting in the following exchange between the\n\njudge and the witness:\n\n          JUDGE:         Well, there was no impediment in you giving\n                         him the transfer authorization irrespective\n                         of the investigation, correct?\n\n          WITNESS:       Well, the fact of the matter is that the\n                         investigation had reflected that there had\n                         been improper use of the sick leave days.\n                         We would have to go to the municipality's\n                         regulations regarding the possibility of a\n                         violation of those regulations or of any\n                         law. And not doing so could have entailed a\n                         finding against us by the controller's\n                         office.   It could be called negligence in\n                         the fulfillment of a supervisor's duties.\n\n          JUDGE:         But even if he had been transferred, you\n                         could always have obtained relief from him\n                         if he had taken those days for the wrong\n                         reasons?\n\n          WITNESS:       Well, at least regarding that aspect, he\n                         could have raised that matter when the\n                         letter was sent to Dr. Silva on June 25th.\n                         And then we would have consulted the\n                         attorney himself . . . or from OCALAR, which\n                         is the personnel agency for the Commonwealth\n                         which deals with these personnel affairs.\n                         And if they said this was okay, we would\n                         have issued the letter.\n\n          JUDGE:         At this time when these things were\n                         happening had he already changed parties?\n\n\n\n\n                                 -25-\n\f            WITNESS:        Yes, he was already a candidate.         This was\n                            the year 2000.\n\n            JUDGE:          Don't you think it would have been prudent\n                            to allow him to go to the Commonwealth and\n                            out of Sabana Grande so that you wouldn't\n                            have any more problems with him?\n\n            WITNESS:        If we were to look at it from that point of\n                            view, it would have been beneficial for the\n                            municipality because we then would have had\n                            a regular position that we could have\n                            filled. But the problem was that since he\n                            was under investigation we could not do so.\n\n            On appeal, defendants argue that\n\n            this grilling of codefendant Ortiz, far from\n            aiding the jury in understanding the evidence,\n            was a cross examination, comprised mostly of\n            leading and argumentative questions geared\n            towards making the following point: the Mayor\n            had no legal basis for denying plaintiff's\n            transfer, this action was carried out while\n            plaintiff was a candidate for Mayor, and\n            defendant was not prudent in making this\n            decision.\n\nThe Federal    Rules    of   Evidence     provide   that   \"[t]he   court   may\n\ninterrogate witnesses, whether called by itself or by a party.\"\n\nFed.

The judge's discretion to participate in the direct and\n\ncross examination of witnesses is cabined by the importance of\n\nmaintaining an appearance of impartiality:\n\n            There are, however, limits to the behavior\n            that is permitted judges.

I have been dealing with this kind of\n            case for over 16 years. And believe me, there\n            are many instances in which a situation like\n            this where the Puerto Rico government takes a\n            person like this and takes a transitory\n            position, puts the person in and down the road\n            in two or three months they change it to a\n            career position. That happens all the time .\n            . . . It may be illegal. But I live in the\n            real world.   In the real world this happens\n            every day in the Puerto Rico government. And\n            this is -- this has been established by the\n            case law. You have thousands of examples and\n            there is no way I am going to instruct this\n            jury about something that is not realistic.\n\n            Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, \"[a] judicially\n\nnoticed fact must be one not subject to reasonable dispute in that\n\nit   is   either    (1)   generally     known   within    the    territorial\n\njurisdiction of the trial court, or (2) capable of accurate and\n\nready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot\n\nreasonably be questioned.\"      Fed. R. Evid. 201(b)(emphasis added).\n\nThe district court is obligated to take judicial notice of such\n\nfacts \"if requested by a party and supplied with the necessary\n\ninformation.\"      Fed. R. Evid. 201(d).     Here the court, drawing upon\n\nits experience, determined that the fact offered for judicial\n\nnotice did not fulfill the requirements of Rule 201(b) because\n\nPuerto Rico law governing the duration of \"transitory\" government\n\nappointments    does   not   always    correspond   to   the    realities   of\n\ngovernment practice.         Therefore, in the court's view, taking\n\njudicial notice of the letter of the law would have misled the\n\njury.     On appeal, defendants offer no persuasive rationale for\n\n\n                                      -29-\n\freversing the court's reasonable application of Rule 201, and we\n\ndecline to disturb the jury verdict on this ground.6\n\n4.    Refusal to Continue Proceedings\n\n            Finally, defendants argue that the district court abused\n\nits discretion in refusing to continue the proceedings to avoid a\n\ntrial conflict involving the defendants' counsel of record.           See\n\nMacaulay v. Anas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200359\"><a href=\"/opinion/200359/macaulay-v-anas/\"><span class=\"volume\">321</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 48 (1st Cir. 2003).             The record\n\nreflects that both parties filed a joint pre-trial memorandum on\n\nJuly 21, 2002, and that the pre-trial conference was approved by\n\nthe district court on July 31, 2002.            On August 1, 2002, the\n\ndistrict court docketed its order setting December 2, 2002 as the\n\nstarting date of the trial.      Attorney Emmanuelli's law firm, which\n\nemploys fifteen attorneys, accordingly had four months' notice of\n\nthe trial date, and four months to bring another attorney up to\n\nspeed on the specifics of this case.          Instead, Emmanuelli waited\n\nuntil the day the trial was scheduled to begin to move the court\n\nfor   a   continuance   citing   an    irreconcilable   conflict.   These\n\ncircumstances preclude any finding that the district court abused\n\nits discretion in denying the continuance.\n\n\n      6\n      Defendants cursorily argue that the district court erred in\nadmitting tape recordings of disparaging statements about plaintiff\nmade by Ortiz during his election campaign. They intimate that the\ntapes were not properly authenticated, but provide no developed\nanalysis or legal authority to support their assertion.\nAccordingly, we deem the argument waived.

Post-Trial Rulings\n\n1.   Damages\n\n           At the conclusion of the trial, the jury awarded Rivera\n\nand his family the following damages: 1) $60,000 to Rivera for lost\n\nwages and benefits; 2) $125,000 in compensatory damages to Rivera\n\n\"for emotional pain and mental anguish\" (pain and suffering); 3)\n\n$75,000 in compensatory damages to Rivera's wife for pain and\n\nsuffering;     4)    $30,000   in   compensatory    damages      to   each   of\n\nplaintiff's daughters for pain and suffering; and 5) $250,000 in\n\npunitive damages to Rivera alone.         Hence, the jury's award of back\n\npay was the only component of the damage award compensating an\n\neconomic injury.       In a post-trial order, the district court sua\n\nsponte reduced this element of the damages from $60,000 to $26,400,\n\nruling that \"the verdict has to be adjusted on the issue of lost\n\nwages because the only evidence is lost wages.                   There is no\n\nevidence of loss of benefits.\"            Plaintiffs do not contest the\n\ncourt's reduction of this award on appeal.\n\n             Where defendants properly preserve a challenge to the\n\namount of compensatory damages awarded by the jury, \"our inquiry is\n\nlimited   to   determining     'whether    the   trial   court    abused     its\n\ndiscretion in refusing to set aside the verdict as excessive.'\"\n\nAnthony v.

Municipal Liability\n\n           Question #1 on the special verdict form asked the jurors\n\nto determine whether \"the actions of the defendant were under the\n\ncolor of the authority of the state.\"    The jury responded in the\n\naffirmative.    Question #9 then inquired whether \"the claimed\n\nunconstitutional conduct of the mayor as a higher authority was\n\ndone pursuant to the policy of the municipality of Sabana Grande.\"\n\n\n                                -33-\n\fThe jury responded to this question in the negative.

In Cordero, we acknowledged the Supreme\n\nCourt's holding in Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111615\"><a href=\"/opinion/111615/pembaur-v-cincinnati/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(1986) that \"municipality liability under § 1983 attaches where .\n\n. . a deliberate choice to follow a course of action is made from\n\namong various alternatives by the official or officials responsible\n\nfor establishing final policy with respect to the subject matter in\n\nquestion.\"     Id. at 483-84 (emphasis added).        The Cordero court\n\nsubsequently noted that mayors in Puerto Rico are the government\n\nofficials ultimately responsible for the employment decisions of\n\nthe municipality:\n\n             Under Puerto Rico law, one of the express\n             powers given to mayors of municipalities is:\n             \"To appoint all the officials and employees of\n             the municipal executive branch, and remove\n             them from office whenever necessary for the\n             good   of  the service,     pursuant  to   the\n             procedures provided herein.\" P.R. Laws Ann.\n             tit. 21, ch. 155 § 3002(15) (1980).\n\n\n\n\n                                   -34-\n\fId. at 7. Hence, Mayor Ortiz's employment decisions in the context\n\nof this case ipso facto \"constituted the official policy of the\n\nmunicipality.\"       Id.     Therefore, as the district court correctly\n\nrealized, the liability of the municipality could not be divorced\n\nfrom the mayor's liability in his official capacity.                     Because the\n\njury   expressly     found    in     response     to     Question   #1    that     \"the\n\n[unlawful] actions of the defendant were under the color of the\n\nauthority    of    the     state,\"     municipal       liability      automatically\n\nattached.\n\n            We applaud the district court's prompt efforts to cure\n\nits initial error, and affirm its decision to disregard Question #9\n\non   the   special   verdict       form    and    enter    judgment      against    the\n\nmunicipality.      Significantly, the jury's responses to Question #1\n\nand Question #9 did not create an inconsistent verdict to be\n\nresolved in accordance with Rule 49 of the Federal Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure.    Fed. R. Civ. P. 49.          The jury's response to Question #9\n\nreflected    its     determination         that    the     municipality      had     no\n\nfreestanding laws or policies that allowed or encouraged the\n\nadverse employment decisions at issue.                 This determination was in\n\nno way inconsistent with its previous finding that the mayor,\n\nacting on his own initiative, discriminated against Rivera while\n\ndischarging his duties as mayor.                  In the absence of a proper\n\ninstruction, the jurors were unaware that Ortiz's actions as mayor\n\nwere themselves the \"policy\" of the municipality.                        Given these\n\n\n\n                                          -35-\n\fcircumstances, the district court's decision to disregard the\n\njury's response to Question #9 is in accord with our resolution of\n\nthe identical problem in Cordero, see Cordero, 867 F.2d at 8, and\n\ndid not unfairly prejudice the municipality.\n\n            We reiterate that the municipality's contention that\n\n\"[t]here is no evidence in the record, suggestive of the Mayor\n\nimplementing any sort of municipal policy,\" simply misses the\n\npoint.   Ortiz had the authority to control the conditions of\n\nRivera's employment by virtue of being the Mayor of Sabana Grande.\n\nThe employment decisions he made in that capacity constituted the\n\npolicy of the municipality under well-established precedent.             See\n\nPembaur, 475 U.S. at 483; Cordero, 867 F.2d at 7.\n\n                                III.\n\n            Our exhaustive review of the record and the arguments\n\nraised on    appeal   reveals   no   basis   for   disturbing   the   jury's\n\nliability determination or damage awards.           The district court's\n\nentry of judgment on the verdict is affirmed.\n\n            So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -36-\n\f</pre>",
