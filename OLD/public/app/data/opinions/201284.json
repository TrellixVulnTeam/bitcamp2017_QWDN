Morris E. Lasker, Senior U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                      Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                  Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                     and Selya, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     William M. White, Jr., and Davis, Robinson & White, LLP, on\nbrief for appellant.\n     Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, and Dina Michael\nChaitowitz, Assistant U.S. Attorney, on Motion for Summary\nDisposition.\n\n                            October 14, 2004\n\f       Per   Curiam.        Ryan    Holmes    pled        guilty     to   one   count     of\n\nmanufacturing counterfeit money. After violating conditions of his\n\npre-trial release, Holmes was ordered to enter an in-patient drug\n\ntreatment program.          At the time of sentencing, he had successfully\n\ncompleted the program, had been drug-free for seven months and had\n\nobtained employment.               In sentencing Holmes, the district court\n\ngranted a        two-level    reduction       in    his    base      offense    level    for\n\nacceptance of responsibility and sentenced him at the low end of\n\nthe applicable guideline sentencing range (33 months).                           However,\n\nthe court denied Holmes' request for a downward departure based on\n\npre-sentence rehabilitation. Holmes is appealing from that denial.\n\n       The government has filed a motion for summary affirmance. The\n\ngovernment posits that the district court's denial represents an\n\nunreviewable exercise of its discretion.                       The government further\n\ncontends,        however,    that    the     meaning      of   the    district    court's\n\nambiguous explanation for its denial need not be resolved because\n\naffirmance is appropriate where, as in this case, it is clear that\n\nthere is no colorable basis for a departure.                              We agree that\n\naffirmance is warranted on these grounds.\n\n       This court cannot review \"a discretionary decision not to\n\ndepart on the facts of the particular case.\" United States v.\n\nRodriguez, 327 F.3d 52, 54 (1st Cir. 2003). However, we may \"review\n\na refusal to depart where the refusal rests upon a legal mistake,\n\nsuch   as    a    mistaken     assumption          that    a   particular       ground    is\n\n\n                                             -2-\n\fgenerically impermissible as a basis for departure.\" Id.             Holmes\n\nargues that the district court's refusal to depart falls within the\n\nlatter category, while the government characterizes it as within\n\nthe former category.\n\n     The   sentencing   judge   stated   that   he   believed   he   lacked\n\nauthority to grant the departure on the grounds requested. He made\n\nan apparent reference to the PROTECT Act (effective 4/30/03), which\n\nhe noted had further restricted the authority of federal judges to\n\ngrant departures, and concluded that he was \"legally prevented\"\n\nfrom granting a downward departure. See 18 U.S.C. § 3742(e).            He\n\nreferred to the possibility of an appeal. Neither the ambiguity of\n\nthe district court's statement nor the expressed intent that the\n\ndefendant be permitted to appeal his sentence settles the question\n\nof reviewability.   See Rodriquez, 327 F.3d at 55; United States v.\n\nMorrison, 46 F.3d 127, 131 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n     Based upon a careful review of the sentencing transcript and\n\ndefendant's motion for a downward departure, we agree with the\n\ngovernment that \"the district court merely meant that in addition\n\nto the absence of extraordinary facts supporting a departure, the\n\nPROTECT Act's de novo review requirements also militated against\n\ndeparture.\" Government's Motion for Summary Disposition, p. 5. The\n\ndistrict court stated that it lacked authority to depart \"under the\n\npractices [defendant] propose[s] in [his] motion\" and \"on the\n\ngrounds that are included in the request.\"           At the time of this\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fsentencing, it was well established that \"[i]n an appropriate case,\n\n.    .   .     extraordinary      presentence      rehabilitation      can   ground   a\n\ndownward departure.\" United States v. Craven, 239 F.3d 91, 99 (1st\n\nCir. 2001) (\"Craven I\").\n\n         \"The PROTECT Act changed the standard of review applied to\n\ndepartures         from    the     guidelines,       eliminating       the   deference\n\npreviously accorded to a district court's application of the\n\nguidelines to the facts of the case.\"                United States v. Derbes, 369\n\nF.3d 579, 581 (1st Cir. 2001).                  The sentencing court's statements\n\ndo       not    establish        that     the     district    court     fundamentally\n\nmisinterpreted the effect of the PROTECT Act as eliminating all\n\ndiscretion to grant a downward departure for extraordinary pre-\n\nsentence rehabilitation.                Nor do we agree with appellant that the\n\ndistrict court's statements of approval of appellant's apparent\n\nsuccess in overcoming his drug addiction represented a finding that\n\nhis efforts were \"extraordinary.\"                   Instead, it appears that the\n\ncourt's refusal to depart was based upon its conclusion that a\n\ndeparture on the facts of this case would be reversed by this court\n\napplying the de novo standard of review applicable under the\n\nPROTECT        Act.       As   such,      the    district    court's    discretionary\n\ndetermination that the facts supporting the request for downward\n\ndeparture did not rise to the level of \"extraordinary\" pre-sentence\n\nrehabilitation, is not reviewable by this court.\n\n         In the alternative, even if the district court's departure\n\n\n                                            -4-\n\fdenial could fairly be interpreted to rest upon a legal mistake,\n\nremand would not be necessary.    This court has held that even where\n\nthe district court mistakenly believed it lacked authority to\n\ndepart, \"where the record provides no basis for departure on any\n\nground, we are not required to remand to the District Court.\"\n\nUnited States v. Gendraw, 337 F.3d 70, 72 (1st Cir. 2003); see\n\nUnited States v. Mayes, 332 F.3d 34, 37 (1st Cir. 2003); Rodriguez,\n\n327 F.3d at 55.   This is such a case because the facts supporting\n\nappellant's departure request do not warrant a departure for\n\nextraordinary pre-sentence rehabilitation.\n\n     \"[I]t is well settled that a defendant's efforts to overcome\n\nhis drug addiction, while certainly commendable, will ordinarily\n\nnot support a downward departure.\" United States v. Sklar, 920 F.2d\n\n107, 117 (1st Cir. 1990).    This is especially so where such efforts\n\n\"were largely prompted by the specific mandates of his pretrial\n\nrelease agreement.\"    Id.    Even overcoming drug addiction is not\n\n\"the equivalent of extraordinary rehabilitation nor a guaranteed\n\nticket to a downward departure on that basis.\"       Craven I, 239 F.3d\n\nat 100.   In several cases, this court has reversed departures for\n\nextraordinary rehabilitation based on a defendant's efforts to\n\npurge himself of addiction. See e.g., United States v. Craven, 358\n\nF.3d 11, 15 (1st Cir. 2004) (\"Craven II\"); Sklar, 920 F.2d at 117;\n\nsee also United States v. Rushby, 936 F.2d 41, 43 (1st Cir. 1991)\n\n(affirming   refusal   to    depart     on   basis   of   pre-sentencing\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\frehabilitation, including successful treatment for drug and alcohol\n\naddiction).\n\n     Based on our precedents, a departure in Holmes' case for\n\nextraordinary pre-sentence rehabilitation would not be warranted.\n\nEssentially, the departure was sought on the basis that Holmes has\n\nsuccessfully participated for several months in the drug treatment\n\nprogram that the court ordered him to enter.         Although he had been\n\na cooperative and enthusiastic participant and had voluntarily\n\nparticipated in addiction recovery groups and obtained employment,\n\nthose factors do not distinguish his case from Sklar or Rushby.\n\nAppellant    argues   that   his   case   is   different   because   of   his\n\ndifficult and abusive family history and his long history of\n\nsubstance abuse and drug addiction, without prior counseling or\n\ntreatment.    However, \"drug addiction [and] a troubled childhood .\n\n. . do not constitute permissible bases for departing below the\n\n[guideline sentencing range].         See U.S.S.G. §§ 5H1.4; 5H1.12.\"\n\nMayes, 332 F.3d at 37 n.4. In a nutshell, the circumstances of this\n\ncase do not \"indicate the existence of meaningfully atypical\n\nrehabilitation.\"      Sklar, 920 F.2d at 117.\n\n     The district court's denial of appellant's motion for a\n\ndeparture from the guideline sentencing range is affirmed.                The\n\nsentence appealed from is, therefore, affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\f",

See U.S.S.G. §§ 5H1.4; 5H1.12.\"\n\nMayes, 332 F.3d at 37 n.4. In a nutshell, the circumstances of this\n\ncase do not \"indicate the existence of meaningfully atypical\n\nrehabilitation.\"      Sklar, 920 F.2d at 117.\n\n     The district court's denial of appellant's motion for a\n\ndeparture from the guideline sentencing range is affirmed.                The\n\nsentence appealed from is, therefore, affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\f</pre>",
