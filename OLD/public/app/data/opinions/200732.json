Gene Carter, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                        Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                   Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                     and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Tina Schneider, by Appointment of the Court, for appellant.\n     Mitchell Wall on brief pro se.\n     Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, with whom Paula D.\nSilsby, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         November 18, 2003\n\f     COFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge.         Appellant Mitchell Wall raises\n\nseveral challenges to his convictions and sentence following a pair\n\nof   jury    trials   on   drug   offenses    charged      in   two    separate\n\nindictments, one alleging cocaine distribution resulting in a death\n\nand the other alleging a scheme to unlawfully obtain and distribute\n\noxycodone.1    He claims, inter alia, that his Sixth Amendment right\n\nto counsel was violated by admission into evidence of a jailhouse\n\nconversation with a fellow inmate and that the restitution order in\n\nthe oxycodone case was improper.          We affirm the court's judgments\n\non all issues.\n\n                                I. Background\n\n     We briefly summarize certain background facts as the jury in\n\nthe cocaine trial could have found them, elaborating further on the\n\nunderlying events and the evidence presented only as necessary in\n\nour discussion of particular issues.\n\n         Early on the morning of September 4, 1999, Loretta Fortin was\n\npronounced dead of an apparent drug overdose.           She and a number of\n\nother individuals, including appellant Wall, had been drinking and\n\nusing    various   forms   of   cocaine    through   the   night      in   Wall's\n\napartment in Biddeford, Maine. The previous afternoon, Fortin also\n\nhad taken ten to fifteen Tylenol with codeine pills, and toxicology\n\ntests performed after her death showed low levels of Valium in her\n\nblood as well.        Others present at Wall's apartment that night\n\n\n     1\n         The two cases were consolidated for appeal.\n\n                                     -2-\n\ftestified that Wall left the apartment twice to obtain cocaine,\n\nthat Wall also bought cocaine with his own and others' money from\n\ntwo young men who came to the apartment,2 and that on one occasion\n\nhe injected Fortin with a cocaine mixture.   At about 4 a.m., after\n\nannouncing that she did not feel well, Fortin went outside for\n\nfresh air and, moments later, collapsed.     Efforts to revive her\n\nfailed, the police were called, and the others who had been present\n\nin the apartment dispersed.   During a search of Wall's apartment\n\nlater that afternoon, police officers found beer cans, syringes,\n\nspoons and other drug paraphernalia.\n\n     Wall subsequently was charged with distributing cocaine, the\n\nuse of which resulted in the death of another, after having been\n\nconvicted of a felony drug trafficking offense, in violation of 21\n\nU.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(C).     At the same time, a separate\n\nthree-count indictment was issued charging him with participating\n\nin a scheme to defraud Medicaid in connection with an alleged\n\nconspiracy to acquire and distribute oxycodone, also known as\n\nOxycontin.   See 18 U.S.C. § 1347, 21 U.S.C. §§ 846, 841(b)(1)(C).\n\nHe was found guilty of all charges in both cases.\n\n     The government's evidence included testimony from a fellow\n\ninmate, Brian Griffin, who reported statements made to him by\n\nappellant when both were detained at the Cumberland County Jail in\n\n\n     2\n       Wall denied that he brought cocaine back to the apartment\nand said that two teenagers from Old Orchard Beach came to his\napartment and sold drugs to the group.\n\n                               -3-\n\fSeptember    2000.      Griffin    was    charged      in    a   related    oxycodone\n\nconspiracy and in May 2000 had signed a plea agreement requiring\n\nhim   to    cooperate     with    the    government.             Griffin    initiated\n\nconversation with appellant after hearing and recognizing Wall's\n\nname during a screening in the jail's medical unit.                     Despite their\n\nrelated    criminal     enterprises,      Griffin      had    no      previous    direct\n\ncontact     with   Wall   and     did    not    know    him      by    sight.       Wall\n\nunsuccessfully sought to suppress the statements that Griffin\n\nreported, including an admission by Wall that he had injected\n\nFortin with cocaine.\n\n      On appeal, Wall renews his challenge to the admission of\n\nGriffin's testimony on their jailhouse conversations.                            He also\n\nasserts the following additional claims of error in the cocaine\n\ndistribution case: (1) that the court improperly denied his motion\n\nfor new trial based on new information that $115 in cash was not\n\nseized from his apartment, contrary to testimony of a government\n\nwitness; (2) that the court improperly instructed the jury on\n\ncausation in relation to Fortin's death; and (3) that the evidence\n\nwas insufficient to establish that Fortin's death resulted from the\n\nuse of cocaine that Wall distributed.             Wall also contends that the\n\ncourt's    restitution     order    in    the    oxycodone         case    erroneously\n\nassessed the full amount of the loss on him and instead should have\n\nspecifically imposed joint and several liability with his co-\n\ndefendants.        In a pro se supplemental brief, he additionally\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fchallenges    the   use   of    his   prior     convictions   in    setting   his\n\nsentence.\n\n      For the reasons discussed below, we find no error in the\n\ncourt's disposition of either case.\n\n                                II. Discussion\n\n      A. Jailhouse Statements\n\n      The Sixth Amendment bars the use at trial of incriminating\n\nstatements that law enforcement officers \"deliberately elicit[]\"\n\nfrom a defendant outside counsel's presence once the right to\n\ncounsel has attached.        See Massiah v. United States, 377 U.S. 201,\n\n206 (1964). Appellant argues that his statements to Griffin should\n\nhave been excluded under this precedent because Griffin was acting\n\nas a government agent when he initiated the jailhouse conversations\n\nwith Wall.3\n\n      We disagree that constitutional error occurred for the same\n\nreasons expressed by the district court in its thoughtful response\n\nto   appellant's    motion     to   suppress,    in   which   the   court   fully\n\nconsidered both the relevant legal principles and the particular\n\nfactual circumstances.         We find it unnecessary to retread the same\n\nground, and instead simply note here our accord with the district\n\ncourt's pertinent conclusions: that Griffin was acting in his own\n\ninterest and not at the behest of the government when he engaged\n\n\n      3\n      The two men conversed at the jail twice within about a week.\nThe second conversation was more extended and included Wall's\nincriminating statements.\n\n                                       -5-\n\fappellant in conversation; that the government neither deliberately\n\ncreated    nor    exploited     circumstances     that    would    lead    to\n\nincriminating statements; and that the government did not \"focus\"\n\nGriffin's attention on appellant, see United States v. LaBare, 191\n\nF.3d 60, 65 (1st Cir. 1999).          In short, the government played no\n\nrole in the happenstance meeting between the two men, and nothing\n\nin the government's prior interactions with Griffin encouraged him\n\nto elicit information from Wall on the government's behalf. To the\n\ncontrary, Griffin had been told not to communicate with anyone\n\ninvolved   in    his   case,4   and    the   government   agents   believed\n\n(incorrectly)     that   a    segregation    order   preventing    such    an\n\nopportunity was in effect.            In these circumstances, no Sixth\n\nAmendment violation occurred.\n\n     B. Motion for New Trial\n\n     Approximately three weeks after the conclusion of the cocaine\n\ntrial, government counsel discovered that $115 in cash that had\n\nbeen admitted into evidence at appellant's trial was not, in fact,\n\nseized from his apartment, as a police officer had testified.             The\n\ncash instead had been found at a different apartment on the same\n\nstreet.    Defense counsel immediately was notified of the error.\n\n\n\n     4\n       Although Griffin and Wall were charged in two separate\noxycodone conspiracies, Griffin testified that he thought they were\ncharged in the same scheme, and it is undisputed that Griffin was\na participant in both conspiracies. Thus, Griffin's decision to\nconverse with Wall was in direct conflict with the government's\ninstructions.\n\n                                      -6-\n\fWall shortly thereafter moved for a new trial, claiming that he was\n\ndenied a fair trial because the government, in effect, used false\n\nevidence to obtain a conviction.5\n\n     In a February 2002 order, the district court denied the\n\nrequest for a new trial, finding that both the police officer and\n\nprosecutor   had   acted   in   good   faith,   albeit   erroneously,   in\n\nidentifying Wall's apartment as the source of the money. The court\n\nfurther found that the currency \"was of little significance, if\n\nany, on the ultimate questions of whether distribution of cocaine\n\noccurred and whether Defendant committed the acts necessary to\n\nconstitute distribution.\"       Consequently, the court found that the\n\nmistake did not undermine the jury's verdict.\n\n     To obtain a new trial based on newly discovered evidence\n\nsubject to disclosure under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963),6\n\na defendant must show both that the evidence is material and that\n\n\n\n     5\n       The $115 was the subject of two brief questions asked of a\nBiddeford police officer, who identified the money and said it was\nfound in the living room of Wall's apartment. The primary reference\nto the currency occurred during the prosecutor's rebuttal, when she\nurged the jury to consider all of the evidence of drug distribution\nfound in Wall's apartment:\n\n     And there was money, remember there was $115 worth of\n     money sitting [i]n Mitchell Wall's living room. Now the\n     kids from Old Orchard were long gone. So think about\n     what that money means.\n     6\n       Under Brady, the government is required \"to produce to\ndefendants exculpatory and impeachment evidence that is in its\ncustody, possession, and control,\" United States v. Josleyn, 206\nF.3d 144, 151 (lst Cir. 2000).\n\n                                   -7-\n\fthere is a \"reasonable probability\" that it would produce an\n\nacquittal upon retrial.           See United States v. Josleyn, 206 F.3d\n\n144, 151 (lst Cir. 2000).7         Appellate      review of a district court's\n\nruling   on   a   motion    for    new    trial    is   for   manifest   abuse   of\n\ndiscretion only.     Id.     We find no such error here.\n\n     Wall's guilt or innocence rested on whether he distributed the\n\ncocaine that resulted in Fortin's death, not on his receipt or\n\npossession of cash.        His role in providing cocaine to the others in\n\nhis apartment      that    night    was    the    subject     of   extensive   other\n\ntestimony and evidence.           Three of those present – as well as Wall\n\nhimself – testified that he obtained cocaine for the group to use.8\n\n\n     7\n       These two elements are really two sides of the same coin.\nAs we noted in Josleyn, 206 F.3d at 151, evidence is \"material\" in\nthe Brady context \"only if there is a 'reasonable probability' that\nthe evidence would have changed the result.\"\n\n     A defendant also must demonstrate that the evidence was\nunknown or unavailable at the time of trial and that the failure to\ndiscover the evidence was not due to a lack of diligence on the\ndefendant's part. Id. It is undisputed that these elements were\nsatisfied in this case.\n     8\n       The testimony linked Wall to the acquisition, preparation\nand injection of the cocaine used by the group. For example, Debra\nLeach testified that Wall left the apartment at one point, after\nArmand Fortier gave him $50, and returned with a baggy of cocaine.\nAccording to her testimony, he later took money from Richard\nPowers, left briefly and again returned with cocaine in a baggy.\nFortier, who testified that he gave Wall money more than once that\nnight to buy cocaine, recalled seeing Wall prepare cocaine powder\nso that it could be smoked and watched Wall inject himself with the\ndrug.   Leach stated that she gave an injection of cocaine to\nFortin, and then Wall mixed more of the drug and injected Fortin\nwith it himself. Leach also testified that Wall bought cocaine\nfrom two teenagers who came into the apartment late that night.\nPowers testified that Wall prepared cocaine for him and Fortier\n\n                                          -8-\n\fIn addition, drug paraphernalia with cocaine residue was found in\n\nWall's apartment, corroborating the witness testimony.\n\n     We therefore agree with the district court that, in the\n\ncontext of the overall case, the evidence concerning the $115 was\n\nof minor significance.    Although it allowed the prosecutor to\n\nsuggest that Wall provided the drugs since he had an accumulation\n\nof cash, there was much testimony about the exchange of cash for\n\ncocaine at Wall's apartment. That the particular $115 shown to the\n\njury was in fact seized elsewhere was thus of little consequence.\n\nIn light of the extensive, much more damaging direct evidence of\n\nWall's role in securing cocaine, the district court did not err in\n\nconcluding that the evidence concerning the $115 was not material\n\nto the jury's verdict.\n\n     Likewise, we reject appellant's suggestion that knowledge of\n\nthe misrepresentation would materially impact the jury's assessment\n\nof the police officer's credibility, perhaps casting doubt on\n\nwhether the drug-related items he identified also were mistakenly\n\nattributed to a search of Wall's home.      The other items were\n\nphotographed where they were found and their location thus was\n\n\n\nafter he, Powers, gave money to \"the kid,\" who had been told by\nWall to \"stoke them up, set them up.\" Griffin testified that Wall\ntold him that he supplied the cocaine used that night and that he\ninjected Fortin. At trial, however, Wall denied injecting Fortin,\nbut admitted on cross-examination that he agreed to get cocaine for\nthe others.    He also said, however, that he did not actually\nprovide the cocaine to the others; they got the drug directly from\nthe two teenagers who came to Wall's apartment.\n\n                               -9-\n\fsubstantiated; the misinformation about the $115 would therefore\n\nnot affect the officer's credibility on the other evidence.\n\n      We reject, finally, appellant's assertion that the court\n\nabused its discretion in refusing to convene an evidentiary hearing\n\non his new trial motion, specifically on the question of the\n\ntestifying officer's good faith.                     See United States v. Rivera-\n\nAlicea, 205 F.3d 480, 487 (lst Cir. 2000) (abuse of discretion\n\nstandard applies to review of refusal to hold evidentiary hearing\n\non   motions      in    criminal         case).      Appellant      acknowledges         that\n\n\"evidentiary       hearings         on    motions       in    criminal   cases     are    the\n\nexception, not the rule,\" id., and we are satisfied that this was\n\nnot the unusual case warranting such a hearing. The district court\n\nhad observed the officer at trial, see United States v. Montilla-\n\nRivera, 115 F.3d 1060, 1067 (lst Cir. 1997), and the fact that the\n\nofficer    erred       in    good    faith     was      not    implausible    given      the\n\nsimilarity between Wall's address and the actual location where the\n\ncurrency was seized.              Particularly given the limited significance\n\nof the $115, the court was well within its discretion to resolve\n\nthe motion without a hearing.\n\n      C.   Causation         Instructions         and    Ineffective     Assistance       of\n\nCounsel\n\n      Appellant makes a multi-pronged attack on the court's charge\n\nto   the   jury    on       the   causal     relationship         between    his   alleged\n\n\n\n\n                                             -10-\n\fdistribution of cocaine and Fortin's death.              The court instructed\n\nthe jury as follows:\n\n       And I instruct you that for you to find that Loretta\n       Fortin's death resulted from the use of cocaine that the\n       defendant distributed, you must find that the government\n       has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Loretta Fortin\n       died as a consequence of her use of the cocaine that the\n       defendant distributed on or about the dates alleged in\n       the indictment.\n\n            I instruct you that you must find the evidence\n       establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that the use of\n       that cocaine played a significant causal role in bringing\n       about the death of Loretta Fortin.\n\n            And I instruct you that the government does not have\n       to prove that Loretta Fortin's death from the use of the\n       cocaine was foreseeable for the defendant or for the\n       others.\n\nAppellant contends that this charge suffered from three specific\n\nflaws: first, although he specifically requested the \"significant\n\ncausal    role\"   language,   he   now    claims   that     this   instruction\n\nunderstated the government's burden of proof; second, he contends\n\nthat the court should have instructed the jurors that, to convict\n\nhim,   they   needed   to   find   that    there   was    no   intervening   or\n\nsuperseding cause of death; and, finally, he asserts that the\n\nwording of the instruction in effect required the jury to find\n\ncausation.    Appellant additionally argues that his trial counsel's\n\nacquiescence to the causation instructions constituted ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel and thus was a Sixth Amendment violation.\n\n       We briefly address the asserted flaws below, but note at the\n\noutset that neither the claims of instructional error nor the\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fineffective assistance claim are properly before us. The causation\n\ncharge as given by the trial judge was requested and specifically\n\napproved by defense counsel.   Indeed, at a sidebar conference held\n\nafter the jury charge, counsel twice confirmed upon inquiry from\n\nthe judge that he had \"[n]o objection and no additional requests.\"\n\nHaving directly bypassed an offered opportunity to challenge and\n\nperhaps modify the instructions, appellant waived any right to\n\nobject to them on appeal.   See United States v. Mitchell, 85 F.3d\n\n800, 807 (lst Cir. 1996) (discussing difference between \"waiver\"\n\nand \"forfeiture\" and noting that only the latter is subject to\n\nplain error review).\n\n     The claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, meanwhile,\n\nruns up against our longstanding rule that \"fact-specific claims of\n\nineffective assistance cannot make their debut on direct review of\n\ncriminal convictions, but, rather, must originally be presented to,\n\nand acted upon by, the trial court,\"   United States v. Mala, 7 F.3d\n\n1058, 1063 (lst Cir. 1993); see also United States v. Martinez-\n\nVargas, 321 F.3d 245, 251 (lst Cir. 2003).    Appellant argues that\n\nthis case is unusual and worthy of consideration at this juncture\n\nbecause there was \"no possible tactical reason\" for trial counsel\n\nto request the \"significant causal role\"   language, and the record\n\nis thus sufficiently developed to permit effective review.      See\n\nMala, 7 F.3d at 1063.   We disagree, believing, as our discussion\n\nbelow indicates, that a tactical reason exists, and that this case,\n\n\n                                -12-\n\flike most, would thus benefit from the trial court's perspective on\n\nthe attorney's performance and its impact.        See id.      In any event,\n\nour   discussion     infra   of   appellant's    specific      instructional\n\ncomplaints strongly suggests that, were we to reach the issue of\n\ncounsel's competence, we inevitably would find no constitutional\n\nerror.\n\n      Turning to appellant's specific complaints, we first address\n\nhis claim that the court diluted the government's burden of proof\n\nby asking the jury to determine whether cocaine that he distributed\n\n\"played a significant causal role in bringing about the death of\n\nLoretta Fortin.\"     Under the statute, an enhanced sentence must be\n\nimposed on a defendant who commits a drug offense \"if death or\n\nserious bodily injury results from the use of such substance,\" 21\n\nU.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C). We have described the necessary proof to be\n\nthat \"a defendant deals drugs and a user of those drugs dies as a\n\nresult,\" United States v. Soler, 275 F.3d 146, 153 (lst Cir. 2002).\n\nBoth the statute and our precedent thus link the jury's finding\n\nsimply to whether death was a result of the offense; an instruction\n\nrequiring   jurors    to   find   a   \"significant\"   causal    relationship\n\nsuggests a higher, rather than lower, burden of proof.            Even if we\n\nwere to review for plain error, therefore, appellant's contention\n\nwould be unavailing.\n\n      We easily can dispose of appellant's second complaint about\n\nthis portion of the instruction, which is that the opening words,\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\f\"I instruct you that you must find\" directed the jurors to reach\n\nthe conclusion contained in the second part of the sentence, i.e.,\n\nthat \"the evidence establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that the\n\nuse of that cocaine played a significant causal role in bringing\n\nabout the death of Loretta Fortin.\"          In context, it is clear that\n\nthe court was advising the jurors that, in order to convict, they\n\nneeded to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the evidence\n\nsupported the specified causal relationship.\n\n     Appellant's remaining point, that the court improperly omitted\n\nan intervening cause instruction, also merits little response.\n\nAlthough he points to the other drugs and alcohol ingested by\n\nFortin, appellant identifies no evidence in the record that would\n\npermit a conclusion that another substance, rather than cocaine,\n\nwas responsible for her death.          The medical examiner testified\n\nthat, in his opinion, the level of cocaine in Fortin's system was\n\nenough by itself to kill her. He further stated that none of the\n\nother substances she had consumed was at a level sufficient to\n\ncause her death, and it was \"very unlikely\" that death would have\n\nresulted from only the combination of alcohol, codeine and valium.\n\nOn   this   record,    the   failure   to    give    an   intervening   cause\n\ninstruction was not plain error.\n\n     D. Sufficiency of the evidence on causation\n\n     Recognizing      that   a   defendant   faces    a   heavy   burden   in\n\nchallenging the sufficiency of the evidence, see, e.g., United\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\fStates v. Scharon, 187 F.3d 17, 21 (lst Cir. 1999), appellant\n\nnonetheless argues that the record does not support the jury's\n\nfinding that Fortin's death resulted from the use of cocaine that\n\nhe distributed.          In particular, he contends that the medical\n\nevidence    does   not    show    that      cocaine,   rather     than   the   other\n\nsubstances, triggered her death.\n\n     Our previous discussion of the medical examiner's testimony\n\nlargely suffices to put this contention to rest as well.                     Although\n\nboth the medical examiner and a toxicologist identified Fortin's\n\ncause of death as \"acute multiple drug poisoning,\" the medical\n\nexaminer's    explanation        of   the    likely    potency    of   the    various\n\nsubstances permitted the jury to conclude that the cocaine was the\n\nsignificant element in the mix.                 Indeed, the medical examiner\n\nexplicitly stated that the cocaine was \"the most important or key\n\ndrug,\" and, when asked by the prosecutor if the level of cocaine\n\nfound in her blood \"could stand alone as the cause of [Fortin's]\n\ndeath,\" he replied affirmatively, assuming that the surrounding\n\ncircumstances were identical.            This was a sufficient basis for the\n\njury's verdict.\n\n     E. The Restitution Order\n\n     Wall next contends that the district court exceeded its\n\nstatutory    authority      in    ordering      him    to   pay   restitution     of\n\n$6,109.89, the total charged to Medicaid in the oxycodone fraud,\n\nwithout specifying that his liability is joint and several with\n\n\n                                         -15-\n\fother    participants     in     the   fraud.        He     acknowledges     sole\n\nresponsibility for transactions totaling $2,029.97, but argues that\n\nthe restitution order must be modified to reflect that he shares\n\nliability for the remaining $4,079.92 with his co-defendants.\n\nWithout such limitation, Wall contends that the restitution order\n\nwould   impermissibly allow recovery in excess of Medicaid's actual\n\nloss and would deny him credit for amounts paid by the others.\n\n        The government agrees that it may recover no more than the\n\namount of the total loss, but asserts that no further court action\n\nis necessary because the limit on Wall's liability is implicit in\n\nthe statutory scheme and explicit in caselaw.                Under 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3664(h), a court issuing a restitution order is permitted to\n\napportion liability among defendants according to culpability or\n\ncapacity to pay, or, in the alternative, to make each defendant\n\nliable for the full amount of restitution by imposing joint and\n\nseveral liability.      See United States v. Scott, 270 F.3d 30, 52\n\n(lst Cir. 2001) (quoting legislative history stating that court has\n\n\"'the discretion either to make multiple defendants jointly and\n\nseverally liable . . . or to apportion the restitution order among\n\nthe various defendants'\").        It is well established, however, that\n\n\"the    victim   may   recover    no   more   than    the    total   loss,   the\n\nimplication [being] that each defendant's liability ends when the\n\nvictim is made whole,\" id.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\f     We think the only plausible view of the record is that the\n\ndistrict court intended to impose joint and several liability on\n\nWall for the full amount of restitution. His attorney specifically\n\nhad requested such an approach, there was no objection from the\n\ngovernment, and no questioning by the court on this issue.     See\n\ngenerally id. at 53 (\"natural reading\" of the restitution order\n\nwithin the context of the statute was that liability would be a\n\nform of joint and several); United States v. Trigg, 119 F.3d 493,\n\n501 (7th Cir. 1997) (\"We do not believe . . . that it is plausible\n\nto read the district court's [restitution] orders in any other\n\nway.\").\n\n     Moreover, although the court did not check the box on its\n\njudgment form designating the liability as joint and several, its\n\ncomments during the sentencing hearing reflect an assumption that\n\nappellant's obligation to pay was to be shared with others.     In\n\nurging the government to eliminate a challenged amount of about\n\n$1,200 from its restitution request, the court noted that that debt\n\nwould in all likelihood be discharged by others:\n\n          We have numerous co-defendants who are already\n     sentenced to pay that amount.    We have an extremely\n     remote likelihood that this defendant is ever going to\n     make any restitution . . . .\n\n     With the nature of the order this clear, we decline to extend\n\nthe proceedings by remanding for a technical clarification.     We\n\nurge district courts in the future, however, to avoid such issues\n\nby stating \"with more specificity than was done in this case the\n\n                               -17-\n\fprecise contours of the arrangement,\" Trigg, 119 F.3d at 501.            A\n\njudgment that specified joint and several liability, up to the\n\nmaximum amount of the loss, would have eliminated appellant's\n\nuncertainty (and basis for appeal) and provided guidance to those\n\nadministering the various related restitution orders.          An explicit\n\nnotation would serve as notice that appellant's obligation may be\n\ndischarged in part by others' payments, information that might\n\nprevent excessive recovery.   See Scott, 270 F.3d at 53 (preferable\n\nfor district courts \"to refer expressly to the limit placed on the\n\ngovernment's total recovery\").\n\n     We therefore affirm the district court's restitution order,\n\nwhich we construe to impose joint and several liability up to the\n\ndesignated total loss of $6,109.89.9     See id. (similarly affirming\n\na restitution order \"on our view that its natural reading is as we\n\nhave described\").\n\n     F. Pro se Claims\n\n     Appellant   asserts   that   certain   of   his   prior    state   law\n\nconvictions based on guilty pleas should not have been used to\n\ncalculate his sentence in these cases because he was not warned of\n\nsuch collateral consequences at the time he entered his pleas.           It\n\nis well established that this is not a viable claim.       See Custis v.\n\nUnited States, 511 U.S. 485, 493-97 (1994) (validity of prior state\n\n\n\n     9\n       As noted earlier, a portion of that loss – $2.029.97 – is\nsolely appellant's responsibility.\n\n                                  -18-\n\fconvictions may be attacked in federal sentencing proceedings only\n\nif grounded on deprivation of right to counsel); Brackett v. United\n\nStates, 270 F.3d 60, 65 (lst Cir. 2001).\n\n                            III. Conclusion\n\n     As our discussion makes clear, none of appellant's substantive\n\ncomplaints casts doubt on the jury's judgment. We therefore affirm\n\nhis convictions.    We also affirm the court's restitution order,\n\nclarifying   that   it   imposes   joint   and   several   liability   on\n\nappellant, up to the full amount of the determined loss, $6,109.89.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -19-\n\f",

We affirm the court's judgments on all issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We briefly summarize certain background facts as the jury in the cocaine trial could have found them, elaborating further on the underlying events and the evidence presented only as necessary in our discussion of particular issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Early on the morning of September 4, 1999, Loretta Fortin was pronounced dead of an apparent drug overdose. She and a number of other individuals, including appellant Wall, had been drinking and using various forms of cocaine through the night in Wall's apartment in Biddeford, Maine. The previous afternoon, Fortin also had taken ten to fifteen Tylenol with codeine pills, and toxicology tests performed after her death showed low levels of Valium in her blood as well. Others present at Wall's apartment that night testified that Wall left the apartment twice to obtain cocaine, that Wall also bought cocaine with his own and others' money from two young men who came to the apartment,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and that on one occasion he injected Fortin with a cocaine mixture. At about 4 a.m., after announcing that she did not feel well, Fortin went outside for fresh air and, moments later, collapsed. Efforts to revive her failed, the police were called, and the others who had been present in the apartment dispersed. During a search of Wall's apartment later that afternoon, police officers found beer cans, syringes, spoons and other drug paraphernalia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wall subsequently was charged with distributing cocaine, the use of which resulted in the death of another, after having been convicted of a felony drug trafficking offense, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(C). At the same time, a separate three-count indictment was issued charging him with participating in a scheme to defraud Medicaid in connection with an alleged conspiracy to acquire and distribute oxycodone, also known as Oxycontin. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1347, 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 846, 841(b)(1)(C). He was found guilty of all charges in both cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's evidence included testimony from a fellow inmate, Brian Griffin, who reported statements made to him by appellant when both were detained at the Cumberland County Jail in September 2000. Griffin was charged in a related oxycodone conspiracy and in May 2000 had signed a plea agreement requiring him to cooperate with the government. Griffin initiated conversation with appellant after hearing and recognizing Wall's name during a screening in the jail's medical unit. Despite their related criminal enterprises, Griffin had no previous direct contact with Wall and did not know him by sight. Wall unsuccessfully sought to suppress the statements that Griffin reported, including an admission by Wall that he had injected Fortin with cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Wall renews his challenge to the admission of Griffin's testimony on their jailhouse conversations. He also asserts the following additional claims of error in the cocaine distribution case: (1) that the court improperly denied his motion for new trial based on new information that $115 in cash was not seized from his apartment, contrary to testimony of a government witness; (2) that the court improperly instructed the jury on causation in relation to Fortin's death; and (3) that the evidence was insufficient to establish that Fortin's death resulted from the use of cocaine that Wall distributed. Wall also contends that the court's restitution order in the oxycodone case erroneously assessed the full amount of the loss on him and instead should have specifically imposed joint and several liability with his co-defendants. In a pro se supplemental brief, he additionally challenges the use of his prior convictions in setting his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons discussed below, we find no error in the court's disposition of either case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Discussion</i></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Jailhouse Statements</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sixth Amendment bars the use at trial of incriminating statements that law enforcement officers \"deliberately elicit[]\" from a defendant outside counsel's presence once the right to counsel has attached. <i>See Massiah v. United States,</i> 377 U.S. 201, 206, 84 S.Ct. 1199, 12 L.Ed.2d 246 (1964). Appellant argues that his statements to Griffin should have been excluded under this precedent because Griffin was acting as a government agent when he initiated the jailhouse conversations with Wall.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree that constitutional error occurred for the same reasons expressed by the district court in its thoughtful response to appellant's motion to suppress, in which the court fully considered both the relevant legal principles and the particular factual circumstances. We find it unnecessary to retread the same ground, and instead simply note here our accord with the district court's pertinent conclusions: that Griffin was acting in his own interest and not at the behest of the government when he engaged appellant in conversation; that the government neither deliberately created nor exploited circumstances that would lead to incriminating statements; and that the government did not \"focus\" Griffin's attention on appellant, <i>see United States v. LaBare,</i> 191 F.3d 60, 65 (1st Cir.1999). In short, the government played no role in the happenstance meeting between the two men, and nothing in the government's prior interactions with Griffin encouraged him to elicit information from Wall on the government's behalf. To the contrary, Griffin had been told not to communicate with anyone involved in his case,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and the government agents believed (incorrectly) that a segregation order preventing such an opportunity was in effect. In these circumstances, no Sixth Amendment violation occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Motion for New Trial</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approximately three weeks after the conclusion of the cocaine trial, government counsel discovered that $115 in cash that had been admitted into evidence at appellant's trial was not, in fact, seized from his apartment, as a police officer had testified. The cash instead had been found at a different apartment on the same street. Defense counsel immediately was notified of the error. Wall shortly thereafter moved for a new trial, claiming that he was denied a fair trial because the government, in effect, used false evidence to obtain a conviction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a February 2002 order, the district court denied the request for a new trial, finding that both the police officer and prosecutor had acted in good faith, albeit erroneously, in identifying Wall's apartment as the source of the money. The court further found that the currency \"was of little significance, if any, on the ultimate questions of whether distribution of cocaine occurred and whether Defendant committed the acts necessary to constitute distribution.\" Consequently, the court found that the mistake did not undermine the jury's verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To obtain a new trial based on newly discovered evidence subject to disclosure under <i>Brady v. Maryland,</i> 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> a defendant must show both that the evidence is material and that there is a \"reasonable probability\" that it would produce an acquittal upon retrial. <i>See United States v. Josleyn,</i> 206 F.3d 144, 151 (1st Cir.2000).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Appellate review of a district court's ruling on a motion for new trial is for manifest abuse of discretion only. <i>Id.</i> We find no such error here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wall's guilt or innocence rested on whether he distributed the cocaine that resulted in Fortin's death, not on his receipt or possession of cash. His role in providing cocaine to the others in his apartment that night was the subject of extensive other testimony and evidence. Three of those present-as well as Wall himself-testified that he obtained cocaine for the group to use.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> In addition, drug paraphernalia with cocaine residue was found in Wall's apartment, corroborating the witness testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore agree with the district court that, in the context of the overall case, the evidence concerning the $115 was of minor significance. Although it allowed the prosecutor to suggest that Wall provided the drugs since he had an accumulation of cash, there was much testimony about the exchange of cash for cocaine at Wall's apartment. That the particular $115 shown to the jury was in fact seized elsewhere was thus of little consequence. In light of the extensive, much more damaging direct evidence of Wall's role in securing cocaine, the district court did not err in concluding that the evidence concerning the $115 was not material to the jury's verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Likewise, we reject appellant's suggestion that knowledge of the misrepresentation would materially impact the jury's assessment of the police officer's credibility, perhaps casting doubt on whether the drug-related items he identified also were mistakenly attributed to a search of Wall's home. The other items were photographed where they were found and their location thus was substantiated; the misinformation about the $115 would therefore not affect the officer's credibility on the other evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject, finally, appellant's assertion that the court abused its discretion in refusing to convene an evidentiary hearing on his new trial motion, specifically on the question of the testifying officer's good faith. <i>See United States v. Alicea,</i> 205 F.3d 480, 487 (lst Cir.2000) (abuse of discretion standard applies to review of refusal to hold evidentiary hearing on motions in criminal case). Appellant acknowledges that \"evidentiary hearings on motions in criminal cases are the exception, not the rule,\" <i>id.,</i> and we are satisfied that this was not the unusual case warranting such a hearing. The district court had observed the officer at trial, <i>see United States v. Montilla-Rivera,</i> 115 F.3d 1060, 1067 (lst Cir.1997), and the fact that the officer erred in good faith was not implausible given the similarity between Wall's address and the actual location where the currency was seized. Particularly given the limited significance of the $115, the court was well within its discretion to resolve the motion without a hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Causation Instructions and Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant makes a multi-pronged attack on the court's charge to the jury on the causal relationship between his alleged distribution of cocaine and Fortin's death. The court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And I instruct you that for you to find that Loretta Fortin's death resulted from the use of cocaine that the defendant distributed, you must find that the government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Loretta Fortin died as a consequence of her use of the cocaine that the defendant distributed on or about the dates alleged in the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I instruct you that you must find the evidence establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that the use of that cocaine played a significant causal role in bringing about the death of Loretta Fortin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And I instruct you that the government does not have to prove that Loretta Fortin's death from the use of the cocaine was foreseeable for the defendant or for the others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant contends that this charge suffered from three specific flaws: first, although he specifically requested the \"significant causal role\" language, he now claims that this instruction understated the government's burden of proof; second, he contends that the court should have instructed the jurors that, to convict him, they needed to find that there was no intervening or superseding cause of death; and, finally, he asserts that the wording of the instruction in effect required the jury to find causation. Appellant additionally argues that his trial counsel's acquiescence to the causation instructions constituted ineffective assistance of counsel and thus was a Sixth Amendment violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We briefly address the asserted flaws below, but note at the outset that neither the claims of instructional error nor the ineffective assistance claim are properly before us. The causation charge as given by the trial judge was requested and specifically approved by defense counsel. Indeed, at a sidebar conference held after the jury charge, counsel twice confirmed upon inquiry from the judge that he had \"[n]o objection and no additional requests.\" Having directly bypassed an offered opportunity to challenge and perhaps modify the instructions, appellant waived any right to object to them on appeal. <i>See United States v. Mitchell,</i> 85 F.3d 800, 807 (1st Cir.1996) (discussing difference between \"waiver\" and \"forfeiture\" and noting that only the latter is subject to plain error review).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, meanwhile, runs up against our longstanding rule that \"fact-specific claims of ineffective assistance cannot make their debut on direct review of criminal convictions, but, rather, must originally be presented to, and acted upon by, the trial court,\" <i>United States v. Mala,</i> 7 F.3d 1058, 1063 (1st Cir.1993); <i>see also United States v. Martinez-Vargas,</i> 321 F.3d 245, 251 (1st Cir.2003). Appellant argues that this case is unusual and worthy of consideration at this juncture because there was \"no possible tactical reason\" for trial counsel to request the \"significant causal role\" language, and the record is thus sufficiently developed to permit effective review. <i>See Mala,</i> 7 F.3d at 1063. We disagree, believing, as our discussion below indicates, that a tactical reason exists, and that this case, like most, would thus benefit from the trial court's perspective on the attorney's performance and its impact. <i>See id.</i> In any event, our discussion <i>infra</i> of appellant's specific instructional complaints strongly suggests that, were we to reach the issue of counsel's competence, we inevitably would find no constitutional error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to appellant's specific complaints, we first address his claim that the court diluted the government's burden of proof by asking the jury to determine whether cocaine that he distributed \"played a significant causal role in bringing about the death of Loretta Fortin.\" Under the statute, an enhanced sentence must be imposed on a defendant who commits a drug offense \"if death or serious bodily injury results from the use of such substance,\" 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(C). We have described the necessary proof to be that \"a defendant deals drugs and a user of those drugs dies as a result,\" <i>United States v. Soler,</i> 275 F.3d 146, 153 (1st Cir.2002). Both the statute and our precedent thus link the jury's finding simply to whether death was a result of the offense; an instruction requiring jurors to find a \"significant\" causal relationship suggests a higher, rather than lower, burden of proof. Even if we were to review for plain error, therefore, appellant's contention would be unavailing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We easily can dispose of appellant's second complaint about this portion of the instruction, which is that the opening words, \"I instruct you that you must find\" directed the jurors to reach the conclusion contained in the second part of the sentence, i.e., that \"the evidence establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that the use of that cocaine played a significant causal role in bringing about the death of Loretta Fortin.\" In context, it is clear that the court was advising the jurors that, <i>in order to convict,</i> they needed to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the evidence supported the specified causal relationship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's remaining point, that the court improperly omitted an intervening cause instruction, also merits little response. Although he points to the other drugs and alcohol ingested by Fortin, appellant identifies no evidence in the record that would permit a conclusion that another substance, rather than cocaine, was responsible for her death. The medical examiner testified that, in his opinion, the level of cocaine in Fortin's system was enough by itself to kill her. He further stated that none of the other substances she had consumed was at a level sufficient to cause her death, and it was \"very unlikely\" that death would have resulted from only the combination of alcohol, codeine and valium. On this record, the failure to give an intervening cause instruction was not plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. <i>Sufficiency of the evidence on causation</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Recognizing that a defendant faces a heavy burden in challenging the sufficiency of the evidence, <i>see, e.g., United States v. Scharon,</i> 187 F.3d 17, 21 (1st Cir.1999), appellant nonetheless argues that the record does not support the jury's finding that Fortin's death resulted from the use of cocaine that he distributed. In particular, he contends that the medical evidence does not show that cocaine, rather than the other substances, triggered her death.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our previous discussion of the medical examiner's testimony largely suffices to put this contention to rest as well. Although both the medical examiner and a toxicologist identified Fortin's cause of death as \"acute multiple drug poisoning,\" the medical examiner's explanation of the likely potency of the various substances permitted the jury to conclude that the cocaine was the significant element in the mix. Indeed, the medical examiner explicitly stated that the cocaine was \"the most important or key drug,\" and, when asked by the prosecutor if the level of cocaine found in her blood \"could stand alone as the cause of [Fortin's] death,\" he replied affirmatively, assuming that the surrounding circumstances were identical. This was a sufficient basis for the jury's verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. <i>The Restitution Order</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wall next contends that the district court exceeded its statutory authority in ordering him to pay restitution of $6,109.89, the total charged to Medicaid in the oxycodone fraud, without specifying that his liability is joint and several with other participants in the fraud. He acknowledges sole responsibility for transactions totaling $2,029.97, but argues that the restitution order must be modified to reflect that he shares liability for the remaining $4,079.92 with his co-defendants. Without such limitation, Wall contends that the restitution order would impermissibly allow recovery in excess of Medicaid's actual loss and would deny him credit for amounts paid by the others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government agrees that it may recover no more than the amount of the total loss, but asserts that no further court action is necessary because the limit on Wall's liability is implicit in the statutory scheme and explicit in caselaw. Under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3664(h), a court issuing a restitution order is permitted to apportion liability among defendants according to culpability or capacity to pay, or, in the alternative, to make each defendant liable for the full amount of restitution by imposing joint and several liability. <i>See United States v. Scott,</i> 270 F.3d 30, 52 (1st Cir.2001) (quoting legislative history stating that court has \"`the discretion either to make multiple defendants jointly and severally liable ... or to apportion the restitution order among the various defendants'\"). It is well established, however, that \"the victim may recover no more than the total loss, the implication [being] that each defendant's liability ends when the victim is made whole,\" <i>id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think the only plausible view of the record is that the district court intended to impose joint and several liability on Wall for the full amount of restitution. His attorney specifically had requested such an approach, there was no objection from the government, and no questioning by the court on this issue. <i>See generally id.</i> at 53 (\"natural reading\" of the restitution order within the context of the statute was that liability would be a form of joint and several); <i>United States v. Trigg,</i> 119 F.3d 493, 501 (7th Cir.1997) (\"We do not believe ... that it is plausible to read the district court's [restitution] orders in any other way.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, although the court did not check the box on its judgment form designating the liability as joint and several, its comments during the sentencing hearing reflect an assumption that appellant's obligation to pay was to be shared with others. In urging the government to eliminate a challenged amount of about $1,200 from its restitution request, the court noted that that debt would in all likelihood be discharged by others:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have numerous co-defendants who are already sentenced to pay that amount. We have an extremely remote likelihood that this defendant is ever going to make any restitution....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With the nature of the order this clear, we decline to extend the proceedings by remanding for a technical clarification. We urge district courts in the future, however, to avoid such issues by stating \"with more specificity than was done in this case the precise contours of the arrangement,\" <i>Trigg,</i> 119 F.3d at 501. A judgment that specified joint and several liability, up to the maximum amount of the loss, would have eliminated appellant's uncertainty (and basis for appeal) and provided guidance to those administering the various related restitution orders. An explicit notation would serve as notice that appellant's obligation may be discharged in part by others' payments, information that might prevent excessive recovery. <i>See Scott,</i> 270 F.3d at 53 (preferable for district courts \"to refer expressly to the limit placed on the government's total recovery\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore affirm the district court's restitution order, which we construe to impose joint and several liability up to the designated total loss of $6,109.89.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> <i>See id.</i> (similarly affirming a restitution order \"on our view that its natural reading is as we have described\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">F. <i>Pro se Claims</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant asserts that certain of his prior state law convictions based on guilty pleas should not have been used to calculate his sentence in these cases because he was not warned of such collateral consequences at the time he entered his pleas. It is well established that this is not a viable claim. <i>See Custis v. United States,</i> 511 U.S. 485, 493-97, 114 S.Ct. 1732, 128 L.Ed.2d 517 (1994) (validity of prior state convictions may be attacked in federal sentencing proceedings only if grounded on deprivation of right to counsel); <i>Brackett v. United States,</i> 270 F.3d 60, 65 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As our discussion makes clear, none of appellant's substantive complaints casts doubt on the jury's judgment. We therefore affirm his convictions. We also affirm the court's restitution order, clarifying that it imposes joint and several liability on appellant, up to the full amount of the determined loss, $6,109.89.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The two cases were consolidated for appeal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Wall denied that he brought cocaine back to the apartment and said that two teenagers from Old Orchard Beach came to his apartment and sold drugs to the group</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The two men conversed at the jail twice within about a week.

For example, Debra Leach testified that Wall left the apartment at one point, after Armand Fortier gave him $50, and returned with a baggy of cocaine. According to her testimony, he later took money from Richard Powers, left briefly and again returned with cocaine in a baggy. Fortier, who testified that he gave Wall money more than once that night to buy cocaine, recalled seeing Wall prepare cocaine powder so that it could be smoked and watched Wall inject himself with the drug. Leach stated that she gave an injection of cocaine to Fortin, and then Wall mixed more of the drug and injected Fortin with it himself. Leach also testified that Wall bought cocaine from two teenagers who came into the apartment late that night. Powers testified that Wall prepared cocaine for him and Fortier after he, Powers, gave money to \"the kid,\" who had been told by Wall to \"stoke them up, set them up.\" Griffin testified that Wall told him that he supplied the cocaine used that night and that he injected Fortin. At trial, however, Wall denied injecting Fortin, but admitted on cross-examination that he agreed to get cocaine for the others. He also said, however, that he did not actually provide the cocaine to the others; they got the drug directly from the two teenagers who came to Wall's apartment</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> As noted earlier, a portion of that loss &#8212; $2.029.97 &#8212; is solely appellant's responsibility</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

She and a number of other individuals, including appellant Wall, had been drinking and using various forms of cocaine through the night in Wall's apartment in Biddeford, Maine. The previous afternoon, Fortin also had taken ten to fifteen Tylenol with codeine pills, and toxicology tests performed after her death showed low levels of Valium in her blood as well. Others present at Wall's apartment that night testified that Wall left the apartment twice to obtain cocaine, that Wall also bought cocaine with his own and others' money from two young men who came to the apartment,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and that on one occasion he injected Fortin with a cocaine mixture. At about 4 a.m., after announcing that she did not feel well, Fortin went outside for fresh air and, moments later, collapsed. Efforts to revive her failed, the police were called, and the others who had been present in the apartment dispersed. During a search of Wall's apartment later that afternoon, police officers found beer cans, syringes, spoons and other drug paraphernalia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wall subsequently was charged with distributing cocaine, the use of which resulted in the death of another, after having been convicted of a felony drug trafficking offense, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(C). At the same time, a separate three-count indictment was issued charging him with participating in a scheme to defraud Medicaid in connection with an alleged conspiracy to acquire and distribute oxycodone, also known as Oxycontin. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1347, 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 846, 841(b)(1)(C). He was found guilty of all charges in both cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's evidence included testimony from a fellow inmate, Brian Griffin, who reported statements made to him by appellant when both were detained at the Cumberland County Jail in September 2000. Griffin was charged in a related oxycodone conspiracy and in May 2000 had signed a plea agreement requiring him to cooperate with the government. Griffin initiated conversation with appellant after hearing and recognizing Wall's name during a screening in the jail's medical unit. Despite their related criminal enterprises, Griffin had no previous direct contact with Wall and did not know him by sight. Wall unsuccessfully sought to suppress the statements that Griffin reported, including an admission by Wall that he had injected Fortin with cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Wall renews his challenge to the admission of Griffin's testimony on their jailhouse conversations. He also asserts the following additional claims of error in the cocaine distribution case: (1) that the court improperly denied his motion for new trial based on new information that $115 in cash was not seized from his apartment, contrary to testimony of a government witness; (2) that the court improperly instructed the jury on causation in relation to Fortin's death; and (3) that the evidence was insufficient to establish that Fortin's death resulted from the use of cocaine that Wall distributed. Wall also contends that the court's restitution order in the oxycodone case erroneously assessed the full amount of the loss on him and instead should have specifically imposed joint and several liability with his co-defendants. In a pro se supplemental brief, he additionally challenges the use of his prior convictions in setting his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons discussed below, we find no error in the court's disposition of either case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Discussion</i></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Jailhouse Statements</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sixth Amendment bars the use at trial of incriminating statements that law enforcement officers \"deliberately elicit[]\" from a defendant outside counsel's presence once the right to counsel has attached. <i>See Massiah v.

Appellant argues that his statements to Griffin should have been excluded under this precedent because Griffin was acting as a government agent when he initiated the jailhouse conversations with Wall.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree that constitutional error occurred for the same reasons expressed by the district court in its thoughtful response to appellant's motion to suppress, in which the court fully considered both the relevant legal principles and the particular factual circumstances. We find it unnecessary to retread the same ground, and instead simply note here our accord with the district court's pertinent conclusions: that Griffin was acting in his own interest and not at the behest of the government when he engaged appellant in conversation; that the government neither deliberately created nor exploited circumstances that would lead to incriminating statements; and that the government did not \"focus\" Griffin's attention on appellant, <i>see United States v.

In short, the government played no role in the happenstance meeting between the two men, and nothing in the government's prior interactions with Griffin encouraged him to elicit information from Wall on the government's behalf. To the contrary, Griffin had been told not to communicate with anyone involved in his case,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and the government agents believed (incorrectly) that a segregation order preventing such an opportunity was in effect. In these circumstances, no Sixth Amendment violation occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Motion for New Trial</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approximately three weeks after the conclusion of the cocaine trial, government counsel discovered that $115 in cash that had been admitted into evidence at appellant's trial was not, in fact, seized from his apartment, as a police officer had testified. The cash instead had been found at a different apartment on the same street. Defense counsel immediately was notified of the error. Wall shortly thereafter moved for a new trial, claiming that he was denied a fair trial because the government, in effect, used false evidence to obtain a conviction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a February 2002 order, the district court denied the request for a new trial, finding that both the police officer and prosecutor had acted in good faith, albeit erroneously, in identifying Wall's apartment as the source of the money. The court further found that the currency \"was of little significance, if any, on the ultimate questions of whether distribution of cocaine occurred and whether Defendant committed the acts necessary to constitute distribution.\" Consequently, the court found that the mistake did not undermine the jury's verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To obtain a new trial based on newly discovered evidence subject to disclosure under <i>Brady v.

His role in providing cocaine to the others in his apartment that night was the subject of extensive other testimony and evidence. Three of those present-as well as Wall himself-testified that he obtained cocaine for the group to use.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> In addition, drug paraphernalia with cocaine residue was found in Wall's apartment, corroborating the witness testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore agree with the district court that, in the context of the overall case, the evidence concerning the $115 was of minor significance. Although it allowed the prosecutor to suggest that Wall provided the drugs since he had an accumulation of cash, there was much testimony about the exchange of cash for cocaine at Wall's apartment. That the particular $115 shown to the jury was in fact seized elsewhere was thus of little consequence. In light of the extensive, much more damaging direct evidence of Wall's role in securing cocaine, the district court did not err in concluding that the evidence concerning the $115 was not material to the jury's verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Likewise, we reject appellant's suggestion that knowledge of the misrepresentation would materially impact the jury's assessment of the police officer's credibility, perhaps casting doubt on whether the drug-related items he identified also were mistakenly attributed to a search of Wall's home. The other items were photographed where they were found and their location thus was substantiated; the misinformation about the $115 would therefore not affect the officer's credibility on the other evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject, finally, appellant's assertion that the court abused its discretion in refusing to convene an evidentiary hearing on his new trial motion, specifically on the question of the testifying officer's good faith. <i>See United States v. Alicea,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198845\"><a href=\"/opinion/198845/united-states-v-rivera-alicea/\"><span class=\"volume\">205</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">480</span></a></span>, 487 (lst Cir.2000) (abuse of discretion standard applies to review of refusal to hold evidentiary hearing on motions in criminal case). Appellant acknowledges that \"evidentiary hearings on motions in criminal cases are the exception, not the rule,\" <i>id.,</i> and we are satisfied that this was not the unusual case warranting such a hearing. The district court had observed the officer at trial, <i>see United States v. Montilla-Rivera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197423\"><a href=\"/opinion/197423/united-states-v-montilla-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1060</span></a></span>, 1067 (lst Cir.1997), and the fact that the officer erred in good faith was not implausible given the similarity between Wall's address and the actual location where the currency was seized. Particularly given the limited significance of the $115, the court was well within its discretion to resolve the motion without a hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Causation Instructions and Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant makes a multi-pronged attack on the court's charge to the jury on the causal relationship between his alleged distribution of cocaine and Fortin's death. The court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And I instruct you that for you to find that Loretta Fortin's death resulted from the use of cocaine that the defendant distributed, you must find that the government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Loretta Fortin died as a consequence of her use of the cocaine that the defendant distributed on or about the dates alleged in the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I instruct you that you must find the evidence establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that the use of that cocaine played a significant causal role in bringing about the death of Loretta Fortin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And I instruct you that the government does not have to prove that Loretta Fortin's death from the use of the cocaine was foreseeable for the defendant or for the others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant contends that this charge suffered from three specific flaws: first, although he specifically requested the \"significant causal role\" language, he now claims that this instruction understated the government's burden of proof; second, he contends that the court should have instructed the jurors that, to convict him, they needed to find that there was no intervening or superseding cause of death; and, finally, he asserts that the wording of the instruction in effect required the jury to find causation. Appellant additionally argues that his trial counsel's acquiescence to the causation instructions constituted ineffective assistance of counsel and thus was a Sixth Amendment violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We briefly address the asserted flaws below, but note at the outset that neither the claims of instructional error nor the ineffective assistance claim are properly before us. The causation charge as given by the trial judge was requested and specifically approved by defense counsel. Indeed, at a sidebar conference held after the jury charge, counsel twice confirmed upon inquiry from the judge that he had \"[n]o objection and no additional requests.\" Having directly bypassed an offered opportunity to challenge and perhaps modify the instructions, appellant waived any right to object to them on appeal. <i>See United States v. Mitchell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196797\"><a href=\"/opinion/196797/united-states-v-mitchell/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span>, 807 (1st Cir.1996) (discussing difference between \"waiver\" and \"forfeiture\" and noting that only the latter is subject to plain error review).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, meanwhile, runs up against our longstanding rule that \"fact-specific claims of ineffective assistance cannot make their debut on direct review of criminal convictions, but, rather, must originally be presented to, and acted upon by, the trial court,\" <i>United States v. Mala,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194994\"><a href=\"/opinion/194994/united-states-v-mala/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1058</span></a></span>, 1063 (1st Cir.1993); <i>see also United States v. Martinez-Vargas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200364\"><a href=\"/opinion/200364/united-states-v-martinez-vargas/\"><span class=\"volume\">321</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">245</span></a></span>, 251 (1st Cir.2003). Appellant argues that this case is unusual and worthy of consideration at this juncture because there was \"no possible tactical reason\" for trial counsel to request the \"significant causal role\" language, and the record is thus sufficiently developed to permit effective review. <i>See Mala,</i> 7 F.3d at 1063. We disagree, believing, as our discussion below indicates, that a tactical reason exists, and that this case, like most, would thus benefit from the trial court's perspective on the attorney's performance and its impact. <i>See id.</i> In any event, our discussion <i>infra</i> of appellant's specific instructional complaints strongly suggests that, were we to reach the issue of counsel's competence, we inevitably would find no constitutional error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to appellant's specific complaints, we first address his claim that the court diluted the government's burden of proof by asking the jury to determine whether cocaine that he distributed \"played a significant causal role in bringing about the death of Loretta Fortin.\" Under the statute, an enhanced sentence must be imposed on a defendant who commits a drug offense \"if death or serious bodily injury results from the use of such substance,\" 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(C). We have described the necessary proof to be that \"a defendant deals drugs and a user of those drugs dies as a result,\" <i>United States v. Soler,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199756\"><a href=\"/opinion/199756/united-states-v-soler/\"><span class=\"volume\">275</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">146</span></a></span>, 153 (1st Cir.2002). Both the statute and our precedent thus link the jury's finding simply to whether death was a result of the offense; an instruction requiring jurors to find a \"significant\" causal relationship suggests a higher, rather than lower, burden of proof. Even if we were to review for plain error, therefore, appellant's contention would be unavailing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We easily can dispose of appellant's second complaint about this portion of the instruction, which is that the opening words, \"I instruct you that you must find\" directed the jurors to reach the conclusion contained in the second part of the sentence, i.e., that \"the evidence establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that the use of that cocaine played a significant causal role in bringing about the death of Loretta Fortin.\" In context, it is clear that the court was advising the jurors that, <i>in order to convict,</i> they needed to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the evidence supported the specified causal relationship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's remaining point, that the court improperly omitted an intervening cause instruction, also merits little response. Although he points to the other drugs and alcohol ingested by Fortin, appellant identifies no evidence in the record that would permit a conclusion that another substance, rather than cocaine, was responsible for her death. The medical examiner testified that, in his opinion, the level of cocaine in Fortin's system was enough by itself to kill her. He further stated that none of the other substances she had consumed was at a level sufficient to cause her death, and it was \"very unlikely\" that death would have resulted from only the combination of alcohol, codeine and valium. On this record, the failure to give an intervening cause instruction was not plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. <i>Sufficiency of the evidence on causation</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Recognizing that a defendant faces a heavy burden in challenging the sufficiency of the evidence, <i>see, e.g., United States v. Scharon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198519\"><a href=\"/opinion/198519/united-states-v-scharon/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 21 (1st Cir.1999), appellant nonetheless argues that the record does not support the jury's finding that Fortin's death resulted from the use of cocaine that he distributed. In particular, he contends that the medical evidence does not show that cocaine, rather than the other substances, triggered her death.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our previous discussion of the medical examiner's testimony largely suffices to put this contention to rest as well. Although both the medical examiner and a toxicologist identified Fortin's cause of death as \"acute multiple drug poisoning,\" the medical examiner's explanation of the likely potency of the various substances permitted the jury to conclude that the cocaine was the significant element in the mix. Indeed, the medical examiner explicitly stated that the cocaine was \"the most important or key drug,\" and, when asked by the prosecutor if the level of cocaine found in her blood \"could stand alone as the cause of [Fortin's] death,\" he replied affirmatively, assuming that the surrounding circumstances were identical. This was a sufficient basis for the jury's verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. <i>The Restitution Order</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wall next contends that the district court exceeded its statutory authority in ordering him to pay restitution of $6,109.89, the total charged to Medicaid in the oxycodone fraud, without specifying that his liability is joint and several with other participants in the fraud. He acknowledges sole responsibility for transactions totaling $2,029.97, but argues that the restitution order must be modified to reflect that he shares liability for the remaining $4,079.92 with his co-defendants. Without such limitation, Wall contends that the restitution order would impermissibly allow recovery in excess of Medicaid's actual loss and would deny him credit for amounts paid by the others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government agrees that it may recover no more than the amount of the total loss, but asserts that no further court action is necessary because the limit on Wall's liability is implicit in the statutory scheme and explicit in caselaw. Under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3664(h), a court issuing a restitution order is permitted to apportion liability among defendants according to culpability or capacity to pay, or, in the alternative, to make each defendant liable for the full amount of restitution by imposing joint and several liability. <i>See United States v. Scott,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775404\"><a href=\"/opinion/775404/united-states-v-alan-n-scott/\"><span class=\"volume\">270</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 52 (1st Cir.2001) (quoting legislative history stating that court has \"`the discretion either to make multiple defendants jointly and severally liable ... or to apportion the restitution order among the various defendants'\"). It is well established, however, that \"the victim may recover no more than the total loss, the implication [being] that each defendant's liability ends when the victim is made whole,\" <i>id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think the only plausible view of the record is that the district court intended to impose joint and several liability on Wall for the full amount of restitution. His attorney specifically had requested such an approach, there was no objection from the government, and no questioning by the court on this issue. <i>See generally id.</i> at 53 (\"natural reading\" of the restitution order within the context of the statute was that liability would be a form of joint and several); <i>United States v. Trigg,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744095\"><a href=\"/opinion/744095/united-states-v-james-trigg-todd-warren-and-stephen-c-krex/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">493</span></a></span>, 501 (7th Cir.1997) (\"We do not believe ... that it is plausible to read the district court's [restitution] orders in any other way.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, although the court did not check the box on its judgment form designating the liability as joint and several, its comments during the sentencing hearing reflect an assumption that appellant's obligation to pay was to be shared with others. In urging the government to eliminate a challenged amount of about $1,200 from its restitution request, the court noted that that debt would in all likelihood be discharged by others:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have numerous co-defendants who are already sentenced to pay that amount. We have an extremely remote likelihood that this defendant is ever going to make any restitution....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With the nature of the order this clear, we decline to extend the proceedings by remanding for a technical clarification. We urge district courts in the future, however, to avoid such issues by stating \"with more specificity than was done in this case the precise contours of the arrangement,\" <i>Trigg,</i> 119 F.3d at 501. A judgment that specified joint and several liability, up to the maximum amount of the loss, would have eliminated appellant's uncertainty (and basis for appeal) and provided guidance to those administering the various related restitution orders. An explicit notation would serve as notice that appellant's obligation may be discharged in part by others' payments, information that might prevent excessive recovery. <i>See Scott,</i> 270 F.3d at 53 (preferable for district courts \"to refer expressly to the limit placed on the government's total recovery\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore affirm the district court's restitution order, which we construe to impose joint and several liability up to the designated total loss of $6,109.89.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> <i>See id.</i> (similarly affirming a restitution order \"on our view that its natural reading is as we have described\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">F. <i>Pro se Claims</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant asserts that certain of his prior state law convictions based on guilty pleas should not have been used to calculate his sentence in these cases because he was not warned of such collateral consequences at the time he entered his pleas. It is well established that this is not a viable claim. <i>See Custis v.

Fortier, who testified that he gave Wall money more than once that night to buy cocaine, recalled seeing Wall prepare cocaine powder so that it could be smoked and watched Wall inject himself with the drug. Leach stated that she gave an injection of cocaine to Fortin, and then Wall mixed more of the drug and injected Fortin with it himself.
