Paul J. Barbadoro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                        Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n              Campbell and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Bjorn Lange, Assistant Federal Public Defender, for appellant.\n     Ann M. Rice, Associate Attorney General, Criminal Justice\nBureau, with whom Kelly A. Ayotte, Attorney General, was on brief\nfor appellees.\n\n\n\n\n                           June 24, 2005\n\f            BOUDIN,     Chief   Judge.       On    December     1,    1995,   in\n\nHillsborough County Superior Court in Manchester, New Hampshire, a\n\njury convicted Robert Haines of one count of felonious reckless\n\nconduct, N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ยง 631:3, II (1996), and one count of\n\nfelonious use of body armor, id. ยง 650-B:2 (1996).                   Haines was\n\nsentenced    to   the   mandatory     minimum     of   three   to    six   years'\n\nimprisonment on the former count, and a 12-month suspended sentence\n\non   the   latter.      Thereafter,   the   New    Hampshire    Supreme     Court\n\naffirmed. State v. Haines, 709 A.2d 762 (N.H. 1998).\n\n            After unsuccessful collateral attacks in state court,\n\nHaines sought habeas relief in the federal district court, which\n\ngranted summary judgment in favor of the state.                 We granted a\n\ncertificate    of    appealability    to    consider    Haines'      ineffective\n\nassistance claims and now affirm.\n\n            The crux of the main charge in state court--reckless\n\nendangerment--was that early on the morning of February 19, 1995,\n\nHaines had taken a loaded rifle out of his truck and pointed it at\n\nan individual named Christian Busch.1             The prior evening, Haines\n\nhad driven to Manchester in a truck with his wife to campaign for\n\nhimself in the presidential primaries. While he was campaigning in\n\n\n\n      1\n      Haines had unquestionably been wearing body armor; but the\nbody armor charge depended on proof that he had done so in the\ncourse of a felony, here reckless endangerment. The two crimes,\nalthough tried together, were listed in separate indictments; but\nthe body armor indictment repeated the facts underlying the\nendangerment indictment.\n\n                                      -2-\n\fa local bar named The Salty Dog, dressed in Western garb and a\n\ncowboy hat, another patron taunted him, tearing up one of his\n\ncampaign pamphlets and throwing his pocket-sized American flag on\n\nthe floor; thereafter, outside the bar, the patron pushed Haines\n\nwho then sought out the police.   It was now nearly one o'clock on\n\nthe morning of the 19th.\n\n           Police Officer Robert Oxley spoke to Haines and the bar\n\nbouncer and concluded that Haines had not been harmed.       Haines\n\nbecame agitated, threatened to report Oxley for dereliction of\n\nduty, and was told to leave the area.   Haines eventually retreated\n\nto his truck, which was parked down the block; Oxley, concerned\n\nabout Haines, returned to his cruiser but stayed in the area.     A\n\nlittle later, two other bar patrons--Jeffrey Meyer and Christian\n\nBusch--left the premises and started down the block toward Haines\n\nand his truck.\n\n           Seeing Haines, Busch mistook him for a friend for whom he\n\nhad been waiting, started toward him at a jog or trot, and shouted\n\nan obscenity.    Haines extracted a rifle from the truck and Meyer\n\nlater testified that Haines had pointed it at Busch.     Oxley, who\n\nwas then driving back through the area, later testified that he had\n\nseen Haines retrieve the rifle and pump it to chamber a round, but\n\nhad not seen Busch or the pointing of the rifle at Busch.    Busch,\n\nwho had fled the scene when confronted with the rifle, did not\n\ntestify.\n\n\n                                -3-\n\f           Haines was arrested, charged as described above, and\n\ntried.   The indictment, tracking the language of the New Hampshire\n\nreckless endangerment statute, charged as to main offense that\n\nHaines had \"recklessly engage[d] in conduct which placed or may\n\nhave placed another in danger of serious bodily injury by the use\n\nof a deadly weapon in that he brandished a loaded Remington .35-\n\ncaliber rifle and pointed it at Christian Busch.\"    Initially, the\n\nprosecution's main theory was that Busch was the endangered person.\n\n           As his main defense at trial, Haines maintained that he\n\nhad brandished the gun to ward off a perceived threat from Busch,\n\nbut had not chambered a bullet until after Busch had fled and thus\n\ncould not in fact have endangered Busch.    Haines' wife testified\n\nthat Haines had been beaten in a prior incident while campaigning\n\nand that Busch had been approaching quickly in a threatening\n\nmanner. She also said that Haines had not pointed the gun at Busch\n\nbut was somewhat shaky on this point.    Haines did not testify.\n\n           During the trial, the state did adduce some evidence that\n\nthere were other individuals outside the bar when Haines had his\n\nnearby confrontation with Busch, but when the prosecution began to\n\nexplore the risk of harm to others at the start of trial the court\n\nexpressed concern and admonished counsel to \"stay within the format\n\nof opening statements.\"   Nevertheless, before the case went to the\n\njury, the trial judge refused a request by Haines that the jury be\n\ninstructed that only the danger to Busch could be considered.\n\n\n                                -4-\n\f           After retiring, the jury inquired: \"Can we consider that\n\nreckless conduct was directed only at Mr. Busch or at other\n\npeople?\"   The court responded that the state needed to prove that\n\nHaines had brandished a loaded Remington .35-caliber rifle and\n\npointed it at Busch and that such conduct placed or might have\n\nplaced another person--including but not limited to Busch--in\n\ndanger of serious bodily injury.             Haines' attorney again objected\n\nwithout effect.      The conviction followed.\n\n           On direct appeal, Haines' counsel did not challenge the\n\nconviction but focused instead on whether the three-year statutory\n\nminimum sentence applied and whether a pair of firearm enhancement\n\nprovisions     in    the   endangerment       statute   violated   the   state\n\nconstitution's double jeopardy clause.                Haines then began his\n\ntravel through state and federal habeas proceedings.                 In this\n\ncourt, Haines argues exclusively that his representation both at\n\ntrial and in the state appeal were constitutionally inadequate.\n\n           An ineffective assistance claim requires Haines to show\n\n(1) that counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of\n\nreasonableness, and (2) that counsel's failures were so serious as\n\nto   deprive   the    defendant   of    a     fair   trial.   Strickland   v.\n\nWashington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984).            It will simplify matters to\n\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fassume, overmuch in Haines' favor, that his present claims were all\n\nproperly preserved in state court and that our review is de novo.2\n\n             Haines' critique of his counsel's performance at trial\n\nis not persuasive.   In the first of two lines of criticism, Haines\n\nsays that he told his counsel that he did not point his rifle at\n\nBusch but counsel did not press this contention at trial and\n\ninstead effectively conceded the point in closing argument by\n\nstating that Haines had \"stuck the gun basically in [Busch's]\n\nface.\" This, says Haines, amounted to ignoring a promising line of\n\ndefense and giving the case away to the prosecution.\n\n            However, counsel's words fell short of conceding that\n\nHaines had actually pointed the gun at Busch; pointing was not\n\nmentioned   and   counsel's   description   fit   within   the   picture\n\npresented by Haines' wife--that Busch had come within six feet of\n\nher husband before turning away and that, pointing or not, Haines\n\nwas at least then holding the weapon in a threatening manner\n\ndefensively, for the purpose of warding off a perceived attack.\n\nMoreover, Meyer gave positive and emphatic direct testimony that he\n\n\n\n     2\n      In most contexts, federal habeas review of state convictions\nis subject to standards of review favorable to the state where the\nfederal issues of fact or law have been decided in the state court;\nand where they have not been decided, forfeiture or failure to\nexhaust are likely to bar the claims. See 28 U.S.C. ยง 2254 (2000);\nWainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72, 81-91 (1977). New Hampshire has\ncolorable arguments that some of Haines' present claims were not\nfully presented to the state court or were presented and the state\ncourt's judgment must be deferred to; but our contrary assumption\navoids detours and does not alter the result.\n\n                                 -6-\n\fhad seen Haines point the gun directly at Busch, and it was not\n\ndisputed that Busch had rapidly left the scene.       Haines' wife\n\ntestified at first that the rifle had not been pointed at Busch but\n\nher later testimony was less clear on this issue,3 and as the\n\ndefendant's spouse she was especially vulnerable to impeachment\n\n(although we recognize that Meyer was a longtime friend of Busch).\n\nHaines previously argued that his attorney had improperly prevented\n\nhim from testifying, but the state and district courts rejected\n\nthat claim and we did not think that it warranted a certificate of\n\nappealability.\n\n          Of course, if counsel had no other defense, failing to\n\npress even a marginal argument would take some explaining.     But\n\ndefense counsel did offer a fairly impressive argument based upon\n\ntwo interlocking claims: first, that Haines had reasonably felt\n\nthreatened based on Busch's extraordinary conduct in suddenly\n\nrunning at him as well as other recent and prior events (e.g., the\n\nbar scuffle, the prior beating); and second, that Haines had warded\n\noff Busch without endangering him by displaying the rifle with no\n\nbullet in the chamber.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      Although she initially testified that her husband had not\nturned to point the gun at Busch until after Busch had fled,\nHaines' wife conceded shortly thereafter that Haines might have\nturned to face Busch as he was fleeing--and then further conceded\nthat Haines might have backed away from the truck to face Busch\nwith the gun before Busch fled, but that she could not be certain.\n\n                               -7-\n\f            This line of attack on the prosecution's case may almost\n\nhave worked; the jury's question suggests that it was in some doubt\n\nwhether Busch had been endangered. Perhaps Haines' eccentricities,\n\nand the fact that when he was arrested his weapon did have a bullet\n\nin the chamber, counterbalanced the jury's doubt.            But at least\n\nthere was no testimony as to whether the round had been chambered\n\nwhen Busch was present; as to whether the weapon had been pointed\n\nat Busch, there was direct and unequivocal testimony from Meyer\n\nagainst Haines.\n\n            One might ask why, if it cost nothing, counsel did not\n\nalso argue in the alternative Haines' current theory that he did\n\nnot point the gun at Busch.      There is more than one answer that\n\ncounsel could reasonably give but two are obvious: to couple a weak\n\nargument with a stronger one may detract from the latter, and to\n\ncontradict the direct and clear testimony of an eyewitness who was\n\nbest positioned to observe a confrontation might weaken counsel's\n\nown credibility in selling his more plausible version of events.\n\n            By contrast, a harmless admission of what the prosecution\n\nseems to have proved anyway can bolster the defense's credibility.\n\n\"Candor,\" said Emily Dickinson, \"is the only wile.\"           See Wilbur,\n\nResponses: Prose Pieces, 1953-1976 Expanded Edition 13 (1999).\n\nCertainly   astute   lawyers   have   operated   on   that   premise   for\n\ngenerations.   Perhaps there was some cost to the concession; but a\n\nreasonable lawyer could easily think that cost was slight or\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fnominal and the benefit real.    This is just the kind of judgment\n\nthat counsel is entitled to make, see Phoenix v. Matesanz, 233 F.3d\n\n77, 81-82 (1st Cir. 2000), and the choice here was reasonable.\n\n           Haines' second line of attack on trial counsel is a claim\n\nthat the latter failed to adequately advance a theory of self-\n\ndefense.   Haines argues that his attorney called no witnesses in\n\nsupport of such a theory; failed to explain, emphasize, or even\n\nmention self-defense in his closing; and did not provide other\n\nevidence sufficient to support the defense. But we cannot say that\n\na claim of self-defense was not presented at all, or that counsel's\n\nfailure to pursue it more explicitly was so serious as to deprive\n\nthe defendant of a fair trial.\n\n           Defense counsel adduced evidence from both Meyer and\n\nHaines' wife showing that Busch had approached Haines quickly,\n\nyelling at him. Haines' wife also testified that Haines had seemed\n\nfearful when he seized his weapon and that prior incidents in his\n\ncampaigning had sharpened his fear.     The judge charged on self-\n\ndefense. And, in his closing argument, defense counsel argued that\n\nHaines had \"protected [him]self by scaring someone\" so he should\n\nnot be convicted.   This is the gist of a self-defense argument on\n\nthe facts of this case.\n\n           Why defense counsel did not happen to use the phrase\n\n\"self-defense\" in his closing is unclear; perhaps he deemed it more\n\neffective to stress the no-endangerment claim, providing the self-\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fdefense theme in a lower key.          Although it arguably does not matter\n\nin law that Busch was not in fact a threat but only misperceived as\n\none, a jury might still feel that seizing a gun simply because\n\nsomeone is approaching quickly and shouting is not an objectively\n\nreasonable reaction.       Anyway, the defense was presented.\n\n               Nor did defense counsel fail to provide some vital piece\n\nof available self-defense evidence.             Apart from himself, Haines\n\nsays that his counsel should have called an FBI agent to testify\n\nabout     an   incident   near   the    White   House   that   Haines   thinks\n\nreinforced his entitlement to feel endangered.             But Haines' wife\n\nadverted to the incident; the FBI agent's testimony had been\n\nlimited in pre-trial proceedings; and there is no indication that\n\nthe agent would have added much, if anything, to the self-defense\n\ncase.\n\n               Haines separately attacks the failure of counsel to argue\n\non appeal that the district court erred in its jury instructions.\n\nSpecifically, Haines attacks the district court's refusal in its\n\ninstructions (twice as described above) to limit the prosecution to\n\nproving that Busch was the person endangered.            This, says Haines,\n\nwas   a   constructive     amendment     of   the   indictment   and    per   se\n\nprejudicial, and so the failure to pursue the issue on appeal in\n\nstate court was incompetent.\n\n               On this appeal, Haines makes no effort to show how New\n\nHampshire law addresses the subject of constructive amendment, and\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\fthat law may well be unfriendly to a per se prejudice claim in this\n\ncontext.    See State v. Elliott, 585 A.2d 304, 307 (N.H. 1990); see\n\nalso 4 LaFave, Israel & King, Criminal Procedure ยง 19.5(b) at 792\n\n(2d   ed.   1999).    Instead,   Haines'   brief   assumes   that   the\n\nConstitution imposes on state prosecutions some version of the law\n\nprevailing in federal prosecutions--that a defendant cannot be\n\nconvicted of a crime other than the one with which he is charged,\n\neven if the evidence shows that he is guilty of this other crime.4\n\n            Just how far this federal doctrine carries over to state\n\nprosecutions--where fair notice is required but not an indictment,\n\nsee Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 499 (2000)--has seemingly\n\ndivided the circuits.    Some federal case law assumes that it does,\n\ne.g., Gray v. Raines, 662 F.2d 569, 572 (9th Cir. 1981), some\n\notherwise, e.g., Wilson v. Lindler, 995 F.2d 1256, 1264 (4th Cir.)\n\n(Widener, J., dissenting), adopted by 8 F.3d 173, 175 (4th Cir.\n\n1993) (en banc), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1131 (1994); there is\n\nlittle full-scale analysis, and this circuit has no clear-cut\n\n\n\n\n      4\n      The case law, stemming from Stirone v. United States, 361\nU.S. 212 (1960), has led a number of circuits, including ours, to\nadopt such a per se theory for certain deviations between what is\ncharged in the indictment and what is proved at trial. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Fisher, 3 F.3d 456, 462-63 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n                                 -11-\n\fposition.5         What is more, just when a per se rule applies even in\n\nfederal prosecutions is a matter of debate and some confusion.\n\n                  The rub is in the definitions.          The titular \"crime\" for\n\nwhich a defendant is convicted must be the one for which he was\n\nindicted, but that is true in Haines' case.                    The precedents in\n\nfederal case law also require a reasonable congruence between the\n\nfacts charged in the indictment and those proved at trial, see 33\n\nGeo.       L.J.    Ann.   Rev.   Crim.   Proc.    270-73   (2004);   but   while   a\n\nconstructive amendment is not allowed, a \"variance\" between the\n\nfacts charged and the facts proved is permissible, provided it is\n\nnot prejudicial.\n\n                  Save at either end of the spectrum, it is far from clear\n\nwhat distinguishes a permissible variance (as between facts charged\n\nand facts proved) from an impermissible constructive amendment.\n\nSee    United        States   v.   Weiss,   752    F.2d    777,   787   (2d   Cir.)\n\n(\"considerable confusion\"), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 944 (1985);\n\nHunter v. New Mexico, 916 F.2d 595, 599 (10th Cir. 1990) (\"shadowy\n\nat best\"), cert. denied, 500 U.S. 909 (1991).                        Some courts,\n\nincluding our own, have suggested that at least where the issue is\n\nconfined to factual deviations, the question turns importantly on\n\n\n       5\n      Our decision in United States v. Kelly, 722 F.2d 873, 876\n(1st Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1070 (1984), could be read\nas rejecting a per se prejudice rule in state prosecutions but only\nby inference from some of its reasoning.       See also Tarpley v.\nEstelle,   703 F.2d 157, 161 n.6 (5th Cir.) (noting but not\nanswering the question), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 1002 (1983); cf.\nFawcett v. Bablitch, 962 F.2d 617, 618 (7th Cir. 1992).\n\n                                          -12-\n\fwhether the defendant has been prejudicially misled.               See United\n\nStates v. Santa-Manzano, 842 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1988); see also\n\nLucas v. O'Dea, 179 F.3d 412, 417 (6th Cir. 1999); Hunter, 916 F.2d\n\nat 599.\n\n           Finally, even if a federal per se test applied to New\n\nHampshire prosecutions, it is debatable whether Haines' indictment\n\nexcluded the possibility of proving that Haines had endangered\n\nbystanders.      The indictment said that Haines had recklessly placed\n\n\"another\" in danger; the indictment did not in specific terms rule\n\nout proof that persons other than Busch had also been endangered.\n\nOn some facts, a constructive amendment label is obvious; on\n\nothers, such as the one before us, much less so.\n\n           Under these circumstances, we are unwilling to say either\n\nthat   counsel    was   incompetent    in    not   making   the   constructive\n\namendment argument in state court or that he would have prevailed\n\nif it had been made.         It is not so much a matter of counsel\n\nexercising a reasonable choice among various arguments; rather, we\n\ndo not credit the idea that competent counsel should inevitably\n\nhave conceived of and credited a line of argument so abstruse,\n\ndebatable and contingent.       The standard for competence cannot be\n\nHerbert Wechsler.\n\n           Perhaps Haines' appellate counsel could have made a\n\ndifferent claim, based not on constructive amendment but on the\n\nmore straightforward argument that he was prejudicially deprived of\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\ffair notice of the charges against him by the combined effect of\n\nthe vague indictment, the prosecutor's opening argument and the\n\ntrial judge's initial caution to the prosecutor when the latter\n\nbegan to stray toward an alternative theory of endangerment.                If\n\nthere had been proof of actual prejudice from this change of\n\nsignals, perhaps it would have been incompetent not to press the\n\nclaim on the state appeal.\n\n          But a due process argument based on lack of notice\n\nassumes a showing that trial counsel's presentation would have been\n\ndifferent had the new theory emerged at an earlier stage.            There is\n\nno basis for thinking that the prosecutor or the trial judge\n\ndeliberately misled trial counsel.          There is no indication that\n\ndefense counsel had or could have procured any evidence to rebut\n\nthe showing that there were others in the vicinity who might have\n\nbeen endangered.       So there is no reason to think that the outcome\n\non the state appeal would have been any different.\n\n          Haines unquestionably had bad luck.

Ann. &#167; 631:3, II (1996), and one count of felonious use of body armor, <i>id.</i> &#167; 650-B:2 (1996). Haines was sentenced to the mandatory minimum of three to six years' imprisonment on the former count, and a 12-month suspended sentence on the latter. Thereafter, the New Hampshire Supreme Court affirmed. <i>State v. Haines,</i> 142 N.H. 692, 709 A.2d 762 (1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After unsuccessful collateral attacks in state court, Haines sought habeas relief in the federal district court, which granted summary judgment in favor of the state. We granted a certificate of appealability to consider Haines' ineffective assistance claims and now affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The crux of the main charge in state court&#8212;reckless endangerment&#8212;was that early on the morning of February 19, 1995, Haines had taken a loaded rifle out of his truck and pointed it at an individual named Christian Busch.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The prior evening, Haines had driven to Manchester in a truck with his wife to campaign for himself in the presidential primaries. While he was campaigning in a local bar named The Salty Dog, dressed in Western garb and a cowboy hat, another patron taunted him, tearing up one of his campaign pamphlets and throwing his pocket-sized American flag on the floor; thereafter, outside the bar, the patron pushed Haines who then sought out the police. It was now nearly one o'clock on the morning of the 19th.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Police Officer Robert Oxley spoke to Haines and the bar bouncer and concluded that Haines had not been harmed. Haines became agitated, threatened to report Oxley for dereliction of duty, and was told to leave the area. Haines eventually retreated to his truck, which was parked down the block; Oxley, concerned about Haines, returned to his cruiser but stayed in the area. A little later, two other bar patrons&#8212;Jeffrey Meyer and Christian Busch&#8212;left the premises and started down the block toward Haines and his truck.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seeing Haines, Busch mistook him for a friend for whom he had been waiting, started toward him at a jog or trot, and shouted an obscenity. Haines extracted a rifle from the truck and Meyer later testified that Haines had pointed it at Busch. Oxley, who was then driving back through the area, later testified that he had seen Haines retrieve the rifle and pump it to chamber a round, but had not seen Busch or the pointing of the rifle at Busch. Busch, who had fled the scene when confronted with the rifle, did not testify.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Haines was arrested, charged as described above, and tried. The indictment, tracking the language of the New Hampshire reckless endangerment statute, charged as to main offense that Haines had \"recklessly engage[d] in conduct which placed or may have placed another in danger of serious bodily injury by the use of a deadly weapon in that he brandished a loaded Remington .35-caliber rifle and pointed it at Christian Busch.\" Initially, the prosecution's main theory was that Busch was the endangered person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As his main defense at trial, Haines maintained that he had brandished the gun to ward off a perceived threat from Busch, but had not chambered a bullet until after Busch had fled and thus could not in fact have endangered Busch. Haines' wife testified that Haines had been beaten in a prior incident while campaigning and that Busch had been approaching quickly in a threatening manner. She also said that Haines had not pointed the gun at Busch but was somewhat shaky on this point. Haines did not testify.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the trial, the state did adduce some evidence that there were other individuals outside the bar when Haines had his nearby confrontation with Busch, but when the prosecution began to explore the risk of harm to others at the start of trial the court expressed concern and admonished counsel to \"stay within the format of opening statements.\" Nevertheless, before the case went to the jury, the trial judge refused a request by Haines that the jury be instructed that only the danger to Busch could be considered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After retiring, the jury inquired: \"Can we consider that reckless conduct was directed only at Mr. Busch or at other people?\" The court responded that the state needed to prove that Haines had brandished a loaded Remington .35-caliber rifle and pointed it at Busch and that such conduct placed or might have placed another person&#8212;including but not limited to Busch&#8212;in danger of serious bodily injury. Haines' attorney again objected without effect. The conviction followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On direct appeal, Haines' counsel did not challenge the conviction but focused instead on whether the three-year statutory minimum sentence applied and whether a pair of firearm enhancement provisions in the endangerment statute violated the state constitution's double jeopardy clause. Haines then began his travel through state and federal habeas proceedings. In this court, Haines argues exclusively that his representation both at trial and in the state appeal were constitutionally inadequate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An ineffective assistance claim requires Haines to show (1) that counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and (2) that counsel's failures were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial. <i>Strickland v. Washington,</i> 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). It will simplify matters to assume, overmuch in Haines' favor, that his present claims were all properly preserved in state court and that our review is <i>de novo.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Haines' critique of his counsel's performance at trial is not persuasive. In the first of two lines of criticism, Haines says that he told his counsel that he did not point his rifle at Busch but counsel did not press this contention at trial and instead effectively conceded the point in closing argument by stating that Haines had \"stuck the gun basically in [Busch's] face.\" This, says Haines, amounted to ignoring a promising line of defense and giving the case away to the prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, counsel's words fell short of conceding that Haines had actually pointed the gun at Busch; pointing was not mentioned and counsel's description fit within the picture presented by Haines' wife&#8212;that Busch had come within six feet of her husband before turning away and that, pointing or not, Haines was at least then holding the weapon in a threatening manner defensively, for the purpose of warding off a perceived attack. Moreover, Meyer gave positive and emphatic direct testimony that he had seen Haines point the gun directly at Busch, and it was not disputed that Busch had rapidly left the scene. Haines' wife testified at first that the rifle had not been pointed at Busch but her later testimony was less clear on this issue,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and as the defendant's spouse she was especially vulnerable to impeachment (although we recognize that Meyer was a longtime friend of Busch). Haines previously argued that his attorney had improperly prevented him from testifying, but the state and district courts rejected that claim and we did not think that it warranted a certificate of appealability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, if counsel had no other defense, failing to press even a marginal argument would take some explaining. But defense counsel did offer a fairly impressive argument based upon two interlocking claims: first, that Haines had reasonably felt threatened based on Busch's extraordinary conduct in suddenly running at him as well as other recent and prior events (<i>e.g.,</i> the bar scuffle, the prior beating); and second, that Haines had warded off Busch without endangering him by displaying the rifle with no bullet in the chamber.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This line of attack on the prosecution's case may almost have worked; the jury's question suggests that it was in some doubt whether Busch had been endangered. Perhaps Haines' eccentricities, and the fact that when he was arrested his weapon did have a bullet in the chamber, counterbalanced the jury's doubt. But at least there was no testimony as to whether the round had been chambered when Busch was present; as to whether the weapon had been pointed at Busch, there was direct and unequivocal testimony from Meyer against Haines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One might ask why, if it cost nothing, counsel did not also argue in the alternative Haines' current theory that he did not point the gun at Busch. There is more than one answer that counsel could reasonably give but two are obvious: to couple a weak argument with a stronger one may detract from the latter, and to contradict the direct and clear testimony of an eyewitness who was best positioned to observe a confrontation might weaken counsel's own credibility in selling his more plausible version of events.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By contrast, a harmless admission of what the prosecution seems to have proved anyway can bolster the defense's credibility. \"Candor,\" said Emily Dickinson, \"is the only wile.\" <i>See</i> Wilbur, <i>Responses: Prose Pieces, 1953-1976 Expanded Edition</i> 13 (1999). Certainly astute lawyers have operated on that premise for generations. Perhaps there was some cost to the concession; but a reasonable lawyer could easily think that cost was slight or nominal and the benefit real. This is just the kind of judgment that counsel is entitled to make, <i>see Phoenix v. Matesanz,</i> 233 F.3d 77, 81-82 (1st Cir.2000), and the choice here was reasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Haines' second line of attack on trial counsel is a claim that the latter failed to adequately advance a theory of self-defense. Haines argues that his attorney called no witnesses in support of such a theory; failed to explain, emphasize, or even mention self-defense in his closing; and did not provide other evidence sufficient to support the defense. But we cannot say that a claim of self-defense was not presented at all, or that counsel's failure to pursue it more explicitly was so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defense counsel adduced evidence from both Meyer and Haines' wife showing that Busch had approached Haines quickly, yelling at him. Haines' wife also testified that Haines had seemed fearful when he seized his weapon and that prior incidents in his campaigning had sharpened his fear. The judge charged on self-defense. And, in his closing argument, defense counsel argued that Haines had \"protected [him]self by scaring someone\" so he should not be convicted. This is the gist of a self-defense argument on the facts of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Why defense counsel did not happen to use the phrase \"self-defense\" in his closing is unclear; perhaps he deemed it more effective to stress the no-endangerment claim, providing the self-defense theme in a lower key. Although it arguably does not matter in law that Busch was not <i>in fact</i> a threat but only misperceived as one, a jury might still feel that seizing a gun simply because someone is approaching quickly and shouting is not an objectively reasonable reaction. Anyway, the defense was presented.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor did defense counsel fail to provide some vital piece of available self-defense evidence. Apart from himself, Haines says that his counsel should have called an FBI agent to testify about an incident near the White House that Haines thinks reinforced his entitlement to feel endangered. But Haines' wife adverted to the incident; the FBI agent's testimony had been limited in pre-trial proceedings; and there is no indication that the agent would have added much, if anything, to the self-defense case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Haines separately attacks the failure of counsel to argue on appeal that the district court erred in its jury instructions. Specifically, Haines attacks the district court's refusal in its instructions (twice as described above) to limit the prosecution to proving that Busch was the person endangered. This, says Haines, was a constructive amendment of the indictment and <i>per se</i> prejudicial, and so the failure to pursue the issue on appeal in state court was incompetent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal, Haines makes no effort to show how New Hampshire law addresses the subject of constructive amendment, and that law may well be unfriendly to a <i>per se</i> prejudice claim in this context. <i>See State v. Elliott,</i> 133 N.H. 759, 585 A.2d 304, 307 (1990); <i>see also</i> 4 LaFave, Israel &amp; King, <i>Criminal Procedure</i> &#167; 19.5(b) at 792 (2d ed.1999). Instead, Haines' brief assumes that the Constitution imposes on state prosecutions some version of the law prevailing in federal prosecutions&#8212;that a defendant cannot be convicted of a crime other than the one with which he is charged, even if the evidence shows that he is guilty of this other crime.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Just how far this federal doctrine carries over to state prosecutions&#8212;where fair notice is required but not an indictment, <i>see Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 499, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000)&#8212; has seemingly divided the circuits. Some federal case law assumes that it does, <i>e.g., Gray v. Raines,</i> 662 F.2d 569, 572 (9th Cir.1981), some otherwise, <i>e.g., Wilson v. Lindler,</i> 995 F.2d 1256, 1264 (4th Cir.) (Widener, J., dissenting), <i>adopted by</i> 8 F.3d 173, 175 (4th Cir.1993) (en banc), <i>cert. denied,</i> 510 U.S. 1131, 114 S.Ct. 1101, 127 L.Ed.2d 414 (1994); there is little full-scale analysis, and this circuit has no clear-cut position.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> What is more, just <i>when</i> a <i>per se</i> rule applies even in federal prosecutions is a matter of debate and some confusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rub is in the definitions. The titular \"crime\" for which a defendant is convicted must be the one for which he was indicted, but that is true in Haines' case. The precedents in federal case law <i>also</i> require a reasonable congruence between the facts charged in the indictment and those proved at trial, <i>see</i> 33 Geo. L.J. Ann. Rev.Crim. Proc. 270-73 (2004); but while a constructive amendment is not allowed, a \"variance\" between the facts charged and the facts proved is permissible, provided it is not prejudicial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Save at either end of the spectrum, it is far from clear what distinguishes a permissible variance (as between facts charged and facts proved) from an impermissible constructive amendment. <i>See United States v. Weiss,</i> 752 F.2d 777, 787 (2d Cir.1985) (\"considerable confusion\"), <i>cert. denied,</i> 474 U.S. 944, 106 S.Ct. 308, 88 L.Ed.2d 285 (1985); <i>Hunter v. New Mexico,</i> 916 F.2d 595, 599 (10th Cir.1990) (\"shadowy at best\"), <i>cert. denied,</i> 500 U.S. 909, 111 S.Ct. 1693, 114 L.Ed.2d 87 (1991). Some courts, including our own, have suggested that at least where the issue is confined to factual deviations, the question turns importantly on whether the defendant has been <i>prejudicially</i> misled. <i>See United States v. Santa-Manzano,</i> 842 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1988); <i>see also Lucas v. O'Dea,</i> 179 F.3d 412, 417 (6th Cir.1999); <i>Hunter,</i> 916 F.2d at 599.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, even if a federal <i>per se</i> test applied to New Hampshire prosecutions, it is debatable whether Haines' indictment <i>excluded</i> the possibility of proving that Haines had endangered bystanders. The indictment said that Haines had recklessly placed \"another\" in danger; the indictment did not in specific terms rule out proof that persons other than Busch had also been endangered. On some facts, a constructive amendment label is obvious; on others, such as the one before us, much less so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, we are unwilling to say either that counsel was incompetent in not making the constructive amendment argument in state court or that he would have prevailed if it had been made. It is not so much a matter of counsel exercising a reasonable choice among various arguments; rather, we do not credit the idea that competent counsel should inevitably have conceived of and credited a line of argument so abstruse, debatable and contingent. The standard for competence cannot be Herbert Wechsler.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perhaps Haines' appellate counsel could have made a different claim, based not on constructive amendment but on the more straightforward argument that he was prejudicially deprived of fair notice of the charges against him by the combined effect of the vague indictment, the prosecutor's opening argument and the trial judge's initial caution to the prosecutor when the latter began to stray toward an alternative theory of endangerment. If there had been proof of actual prejudice from this change of signals, perhaps it would have been incompetent not to press the claim on the state appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But a due process argument based on lack of notice assumes a showing that trial counsel's presentation would have been different had the new theory emerged at an earlier stage. There is no basis for thinking that the prosecutor or the trial judge deliberately misled trial counsel. There is no indication that defense counsel had or could have procured any evidence to rebut the showing that there were others in the vicinity who might have been endangered. So there is no reason to think that the outcome on the state appeal would have been any different.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Haines unquestionably had bad luck. His case was the result of two different mistakes&#8212;Busch's misidentification of Haines and Haines' misperception of the threat Busch posed&#8212;and some juries would likely have acquitted. The real villain, one might conclude, was the mandatory sentencing law that punished a truant act as a major felony. But we cannot say that the representation Haines received fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and that is the only issue before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Haines had unquestionably been wearing body armor; but the body armor charge depended on proof that he had done so in the course of a felony, here reckless endangerment.

Sykes,</i> 433 U.S. 72, 81-91, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977). New Hampshire has colorable arguments that some of Haines' present claims were not fully presented to the state court or were presented and the state court's judgment must be deferred to; but our contrary assumption avoids detours and does not alter the result.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Although she initially testified that her husband had not turned to point the gun at Busch until after Busch had fled, Haines' wife conceded shortly thereafter that Haines might have turned to face Busch as he was fleeing&#8212;and then further conceded that Haines might have backed away from the truck to face Busch with the gun before Busch fled, but that she could not be certain</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The case law, stemming from<i>Stirone v.

Ann. &#167; 631:3, II (1996), and one count of felonious use of body armor, <i>id.</i> &#167; 650-B:2 (1996). Haines was sentenced to the mandatory minimum of three to six years' imprisonment on the former count, and a 12-month suspended sentence on the latter. Thereafter, the New Hampshire Supreme Court affirmed. <i>State v. Haines,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">692</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">709</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">762</span></span> (1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After unsuccessful collateral attacks in state court, Haines sought habeas relief in the federal district court, which granted summary judgment in favor of the state. We granted a certificate of appealability to consider Haines' ineffective assistance claims and now affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The crux of the main charge in state court&#8212;reckless endangerment&#8212;was that early on the morning of February 19, 1995, Haines had taken a loaded rifle out of his truck and pointed it at an individual named Christian Busch.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The prior evening, Haines had driven to Manchester in a truck with his wife to campaign for himself in the presidential primaries. While he was campaigning in a local bar named The Salty Dog, dressed in Western garb and a cowboy hat, another patron taunted him, tearing up one of his campaign pamphlets and throwing his pocket-sized American flag on the floor; thereafter, outside the bar, the patron pushed Haines who then sought out the police. It was now nearly one o'clock on the morning of the 19th.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Police Officer Robert Oxley spoke to Haines and the bar bouncer and concluded that Haines had not been harmed. Haines became agitated, threatened to report Oxley for dereliction of duty, and was told to leave the area. Haines eventually retreated to his truck, which was parked down the block; Oxley, concerned about Haines, returned to his cruiser but stayed in the area. A little later, two other bar patrons&#8212;Jeffrey Meyer and Christian Busch&#8212;left the premises and started down the block toward Haines and his truck.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seeing Haines, Busch mistook him for a friend for whom he had been waiting, started toward him at a jog or trot, and shouted an obscenity. Haines extracted a rifle from the truck and Meyer later testified that Haines had pointed it at Busch. Oxley, who was then driving back through the area, later testified that he had seen Haines retrieve the rifle and pump it to chamber a round, but had not seen Busch or the pointing of the rifle at Busch. Busch, who had fled the scene when confronted with the rifle, did not testify.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Haines was arrested, charged as described above, and tried. The indictment, tracking the language of the New Hampshire reckless endangerment statute, charged as to main offense that Haines had \"recklessly engage[d] in conduct which placed or may have placed another in danger of serious bodily injury by the use of a deadly weapon in that he brandished a loaded Remington .35-caliber rifle and pointed it at Christian Busch.\" Initially, the prosecution's main theory was that Busch was the endangered person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As his main defense at trial, Haines maintained that he had brandished the gun to ward off a perceived threat from Busch, but had not chambered a bullet until after Busch had fled and thus could not in fact have endangered Busch. Haines' wife testified that Haines had been beaten in a prior incident while campaigning and that Busch had been approaching quickly in a threatening manner. She also said that Haines had not pointed the gun at Busch but was somewhat shaky on this point. Haines did not testify.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the trial, the state did adduce some evidence that there were other individuals outside the bar when Haines had his nearby confrontation with Busch, but when the prosecution began to explore the risk of harm to others at the start of trial the court expressed concern and admonished counsel to \"stay within the format of opening statements.\" Nevertheless, before the case went to the jury, the trial judge refused a request by Haines that the jury be instructed that only the danger to Busch could be considered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After retiring, the jury inquired: \"Can we consider that reckless conduct was directed only at Mr. Busch or at other people?\" The court responded that the state needed to prove that Haines had brandished a loaded Remington .35-caliber rifle and pointed it at Busch and that such conduct placed or might have placed another person&#8212;including but not limited to Busch&#8212;in danger of serious bodily injury. Haines' attorney again objected without effect. The conviction followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On direct appeal, Haines' counsel did not challenge the conviction but focused instead on whether the three-year statutory minimum sentence applied and whether a pair of firearm enhancement provisions in the endangerment statute violated the state constitution's double jeopardy clause. Haines then began his travel through state and federal habeas proceedings. In this court, Haines argues exclusively that his representation both at trial and in the state appeal were constitutionally inadequate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An ineffective assistance claim requires Haines to show (1) that counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and (2) that counsel's failures were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial. <i>Strickland v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span>, 687, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">674</span></a></span> (1984). It will simplify matters to assume, overmuch in Haines' favor, that his present claims were all properly preserved in state court and that our review is <i>de novo.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Haines' critique of his counsel's performance at trial is not persuasive. In the first of two lines of criticism, Haines says that he told his counsel that he did not point his rifle at Busch but counsel did not press this contention at trial and instead effectively conceded the point in closing argument by stating that Haines had \"stuck the gun basically in [Busch's] face.\" This, says Haines, amounted to ignoring a promising line of defense and giving the case away to the prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, counsel's words fell short of conceding that Haines had actually pointed the gun at Busch; pointing was not mentioned and counsel's description fit within the picture presented by Haines' wife&#8212;that Busch had come within six feet of her husband before turning away and that, pointing or not, Haines was at least then holding the weapon in a threatening manner defensively, for the purpose of warding off a perceived attack. Moreover, Meyer gave positive and emphatic direct testimony that he had seen Haines point the gun directly at Busch, and it was not disputed that Busch had rapidly left the scene. Haines' wife testified at first that the rifle had not been pointed at Busch but her later testimony was less clear on this issue,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and as the defendant's spouse she was especially vulnerable to impeachment (although we recognize that Meyer was a longtime friend of Busch). Haines previously argued that his attorney had improperly prevented him from testifying, but the state and district courts rejected that claim and we did not think that it warranted a certificate of appealability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, if counsel had no other defense, failing to press even a marginal argument would take some explaining. But defense counsel did offer a fairly impressive argument based upon two interlocking claims: first, that Haines had reasonably felt threatened based on Busch's extraordinary conduct in suddenly running at him as well as other recent and prior events (<i>e.g.,</i> the bar scuffle, the prior beating); and second, that Haines had warded off Busch without endangering him by displaying the rifle with no bullet in the chamber.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This line of attack on the prosecution's case may almost have worked; the jury's question suggests that it was in some doubt whether Busch had been endangered. Perhaps Haines' eccentricities, and the fact that when he was arrested his weapon did have a bullet in the chamber, counterbalanced the jury's doubt. But at least there was no testimony as to whether the round had been chambered when Busch was present; as to whether the weapon had been pointed at Busch, there was direct and unequivocal testimony from Meyer against Haines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One might ask why, if it cost nothing, counsel did not also argue in the alternative Haines' current theory that he did not point the gun at Busch. There is more than one answer that counsel could reasonably give but two are obvious: to couple a weak argument with a stronger one may detract from the latter, and to contradict the direct and clear testimony of an eyewitness who was best positioned to observe a confrontation might weaken counsel's own credibility in selling his more plausible version of events.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By contrast, a harmless admission of what the prosecution seems to have proved anyway can bolster the defense's credibility. \"Candor,\" said Emily Dickinson, \"is the only wile.\" <i>See</i> Wilbur, <i>Responses: Prose Pieces, 1953-1976 Expanded Edition</i> 13 (1999). Certainly astute lawyers have operated on that premise for generations. Perhaps there was some cost to the concession; but a reasonable lawyer could easily think that cost was slight or nominal and the benefit real. This is just the kind of judgment that counsel is entitled to make, <i>see Phoenix v. Matesanz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771201\"><a href=\"/opinion/771201/kenneth-p-phoenix-v-james-matesanz/\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">77</span></a></span>, 81-82 (1st Cir.2000), and the choice here was reasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Haines' second line of attack on trial counsel is a claim that the latter failed to adequately advance a theory of self-defense. Haines argues that his attorney called no witnesses in support of such a theory; failed to explain, emphasize, or even mention self-defense in his closing; and did not provide other evidence sufficient to support the defense. But we cannot say that a claim of self-defense was not presented at all, or that counsel's failure to pursue it more explicitly was so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defense counsel adduced evidence from both Meyer and Haines' wife showing that Busch had approached Haines quickly, yelling at him. Haines' wife also testified that Haines had seemed fearful when he seized his weapon and that prior incidents in his campaigning had sharpened his fear. The judge charged on self-defense. And, in his closing argument, defense counsel argued that Haines had \"protected [him]self by scaring someone\" so he should not be convicted. This is the gist of a self-defense argument on the facts of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Why defense counsel did not happen to use the phrase \"self-defense\" in his closing is unclear; perhaps he deemed it more effective to stress the no-endangerment claim, providing the self-defense theme in a lower key. Although it arguably does not matter in law that Busch was not <i>in fact</i> a threat but only misperceived as one, a jury might still feel that seizing a gun simply because someone is approaching quickly and shouting is not an objectively reasonable reaction. Anyway, the defense was presented.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor did defense counsel fail to provide some vital piece of available self-defense evidence. Apart from himself, Haines says that his counsel should have called an FBI agent to testify about an incident near the White House that Haines thinks reinforced his entitlement to feel endangered. But Haines' wife adverted to the incident; the FBI agent's testimony had been limited in pre-trial proceedings; and there is no indication that the agent would have added much, if anything, to the self-defense case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Haines separately attacks the failure of counsel to argue on appeal that the district court erred in its jury instructions. Specifically, Haines attacks the district court's refusal in its instructions (twice as described above) to limit the prosecution to proving that Busch was the person endangered. This, says Haines, was a constructive amendment of the indictment and <i>per se</i> prejudicial, and so the failure to pursue the issue on appeal in state court was incompetent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal, Haines makes no effort to show how New Hampshire law addresses the subject of constructive amendment, and that law may well be unfriendly to a <i>per se</i> prejudice claim in this context. <i>See State v. Elliott,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">759</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">585</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">304</span></span>, 307 (1990); <i>see also</i> 4 LaFave, Israel &amp; King, <i>Criminal Procedure</i> &#167; 19.5(b) at 792 (2d ed.1999). Instead, Haines' brief assumes that the Constitution imposes on state prosecutions some version of the law prevailing in federal prosecutions&#8212;that a defendant cannot be convicted of a crime other than the one with which he is charged, even if the evidence shows that he is guilty of this other crime.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Just how far this federal doctrine carries over to state prosecutions&#8212;where fair notice is required but not an indictment, <i>see Apprendi v.

The titular \"crime\" for which a defendant is convicted must be the one for which he was indicted, but that is true in Haines' case. The precedents in federal case law <i>also</i> require a reasonable congruence between the facts charged in the indictment and those proved at trial, <i>see</i> 33 Geo. L.J. Ann. Rev.Crim. Proc. 270-73 (2004); but while a constructive amendment is not allowed, a \"variance\" between the facts charged and the facts proved is permissible, provided it is not prejudicial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Save at either end of the spectrum, it is far from clear what distinguishes a permissible variance (as between facts charged and facts proved) from an impermissible constructive amendment. <i>See United States v.

Some courts, including our own, have suggested that at least where the issue is confined to factual deviations, the question turns importantly on whether the defendant has been <i>prejudicially</i> misled. <i>See United States v.

The indictment said that Haines had recklessly placed \"another\" in danger; the indictment did not in specific terms rule out proof that persons other than Busch had also been endangered. On some facts, a constructive amendment label is obvious; on others, such as the one before us, much less so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, we are unwilling to say either that counsel was incompetent in not making the constructive amendment argument in state court or that he would have prevailed if it had been made. It is not so much a matter of counsel exercising a reasonable choice among various arguments; rather, we do not credit the idea that competent counsel should inevitably have conceived of and credited a line of argument so abstruse, debatable and contingent. The standard for competence cannot be Herbert Wechsler.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perhaps Haines' appellate counsel could have made a different claim, based not on constructive amendment but on the more straightforward argument that he was prejudicially deprived of fair notice of the charges against him by the combined effect of the vague indictment, the prosecutor's opening argument and the trial judge's initial caution to the prosecutor when the latter began to stray toward an alternative theory of endangerment. If there had been proof of actual prejudice from this change of signals, perhaps it would have been incompetent not to press the claim on the state appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But a due process argument based on lack of notice assumes a showing that trial counsel's presentation would have been different had the new theory emerged at an earlier stage. There is no basis for thinking that the prosecutor or the trial judge deliberately misled trial counsel. There is no indication that defense counsel had or could have procured any evidence to rebut the showing that there were others in the vicinity who might have been endangered. So there is no reason to think that the outcome on the state appeal would have been any different.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Haines unquestionably had bad luck. His case was the result of two different mistakes&#8212;Busch's misidentification of Haines and Haines' misperception of the threat Busch posed&#8212;and some juries would likely have acquitted. The real villain, one might conclude, was the mandatory sentencing law that punished a truant act as a major felony. But we cannot say that the representation Haines received fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and that is the only issue before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Haines had unquestionably been wearing body armor; but the body armor charge depended on proof that he had done so in the course of a felony, here reckless endangerment.
