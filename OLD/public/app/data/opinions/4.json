ANSYS, Inc. (\"ANSYS\") is a company\n\nthat produces propriety software in the field of computational\n\nfluid dynamics (\"CFD\").     In August 2009, ANSYS sued its former\n\nemployee, Dr. Doru Caraeni, and his new employer, Computational\n\nDynamics North America, Ltd. (\"CDNA\"), in the federal district\n\ncourt for the district of New Hampshire, alleging breach by Dr.\n\nCaraeni of the noncompetition and confidentiality clauses in his\n\nANSYS employment contract, interference with contractual relations,\n\nmisappropriation of trade secrets, and unfair trade practices.\n\nCDNA and ANSYS are competitors; together they occupy approximately\n\n80 percent of the market for CFD software, which is used for\n\nmodeling and simulating fluid and gas flows.    ANSYS had employed\n\nDr. Caraeni from January 2002 to May 2009 to develop code for CFD\n\nsimulation software.\n\n          ANSYS sought a preliminary injunction to enforce the\n\nprovisions of a one-year noncompetition clause in Dr. Caraeni's\n\nemployment agreement.     The district court denied the request,\n\nfinding that ANSYS had not met the requirements for injunctive\n\nrelief.   See ANSYS, Inc. v. Computational Dynamics N. Am., Ltd.,\n\nCiv. No. 09-cv-284-SM, 2009 WL 4403745 (D.N.H. Nov. 25, 2009).   We\n\nexpedited the appeal.     After oral argument this court issued an\n\norder affirming the denial of preliminary injunctive relief.     We\n\nalso said we would later issue our opinion in this case, as we do\n\nnow, and judgment would not enter until we had done so.\n\n\n                                -2-\n\f                                      I.\n\n            Our standard of review for denials of injunctive relief\n\nis strict: \"we will reverse such a denial only if the district\n\ncourt mistook the law, clearly erred in its factual assessments, or\n\notherwise   abused     its   discretion     in    granting     the     preliminary\n\ninjunction.\"       McClure v. Galvin, 386 F.3d 36, 41 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).              While we think this case is\n\nclose, we cannot say the court abused its discretion.\n\n            When     deciding   whether     to     grant     ANSYS     preliminary\n\ninjunctive relief, the district court was required to weigh four\n\nfactors: (1) whether ANSYS had shown a likelihood of success on the\n\nmerits,   (2)      whether   ANSYS   had    shown    that     it     would   suffer\n\nirreparable harm if the injunction was denied, (3) the balance of\n\nthe relevant hardships, and (4) any impact that the court's ruling\n\nmay have on the public interest.            See Wine & Spirits Retailers,\n\nInc. v. Rhode Island, 418 F.3d 36, 46 (1st Cir. 2005).                  The first\n\nfactor, likelihood of success, is usually given particularly heavy\n\nweight. Waldron v. George Weston Bakeries Inc., 570 F.3d 5, 8 (1st\n\nCir. 2009).        The district court denied ANSYS's motion on the\n\ngrounds that the company had failed to demonstrate likely success\n\non the merits and also failed to show that it would                          suffer\n\nirreparable harm absent injunctive relief.                 ANSYS, Inc., 2009 WL\n\n4403745, at *5-7.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\f           We begin our review of the district court's decision with\n\nthe contract clause in question, which Dr. Caraeni had signed in\n\nSeptember 2001.    It reads, in relevant part, \"I agree that for a\n\nperiod of one (1) year following termination of my employment with\n\n[ANSYS], I will not become an employee . . . or in any way engage\n\nin or contribute my knowledge to a competitor of [ANSYS].\"\n\n           Perhaps recognizing how poorly drafted this clause is,\n\nANSYS offers two pertinent narrowing constructions: (1) the clause\n\nonly applies to those employees who have access to confidential\n\ninformation or trade secrets--thus, the clause would not apply to,\n\nfor instance, a maintenance worker; and (2) the clause only applies\n\nto employees who are in a position to use that information at their\n\nnew employer.     This interpretation, of course, requires judicial\n\nreconstruction of the broadly drafted contract language.\n\n           Against the backdrop of these constructions, ANSYS argues\n\nit has to show two things, and no more, to establish breach of\n\ncontract: that Dr. Caraeni had access to confidential information\n\nwhile at ANSYS and that he is in a position to use this knowledge\n\nat CDNA.   ANSYS asserts it met this burden on the evidence produced\n\nat the one-day evidentiary hearing before the district court.\n\n           As a result, ANSYS argues, it has shown Dr. Caraeni was\n\nin breach of his contract and that it will succeed on the merits of\n\nits claims.     Since likelihood of success on the merits normally\n\nweighs heavily in the preliminary injunction calculus, ANSYS urges\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fthis showing is sufficient to merit preliminary injunctive relief.\n\nANSYS also argues that proving breach, and no more, was sufficient\n\nto demonstrate irreparable harm and further support its request for\n\nthe preliminary injunction.\n\n            ANSYS asserts that holding it to any greater showing on\n\nthe likelihood of success or irreparable harm would effectively\n\neliminate the noncompete clause from the contract. ANSYS says that\n\nfor the noncompete clause to have any meaning, the clause must be\n\nread to give ANSYS some greater benefit than the protection it\n\nenjoys under common law for its trade secrets and confidential\n\ninformation.     ANSYS   urges   that   the   district   court   erred   by\n\nanalyzing this case as though it was simply a trade secrets case.\n\nAfter all, ANSYS notes, it did not seek a preliminary injunction on\n\nits trade secrets claim.\n\n            ANSYS's argument about the import of its contract clause\n\nis not irrational and one might well be sympathetic to it.               See\n\nCont'l Group, Inc. v. Kinsley, 422 F. Supp. 838, 843 (D. Conn.\n\n1976) (finding a covenant not to compete for eighteen months\n\nreasonable under New York law to the extent that it barred similar\n\nemployment at a direct competitor working to develop an identical\n\nproduct).    As Judge Newman observed in that case, it is unclear\n\nthat the test for enforcing a noncompetition covenant should be the\n\nsame as would be used in obtaining an injunction to bar disclosure\n\nof trade secrets or an injunction to enforce a covenant not to\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fdisclose         trade     secrets.          The   court   explained,      \"[t]he\n\nnon-competition covenant adds something to the protection available\n\nto the employer beyond what he would expect from the normal\n\nincidents of the employer-employee relationship or from a secrecy\n\nagreement.\"            Id. at 844.        Here, the contract clause could be\n\njustified as a prophylaxis, protecting ANSYS in a situation that\n\ncreated a high risk of disclosure of its confidential information\n\nto a competitor.          See id. at 845.\n\n                 Whether New Hampshire law would enforce an agreement so\n\nconstrued is quite a different matter.              ANSYS's arguments presume\n\nits noncompetition clause is enforceable. However, New Hampshire's\n\npublic policy discourages covenants not to compete, allowing them\n\nonly       \"if   the    restraint    is    reasonable,   given   the   particular\n\ncircumstances of the case.\"           Merrimack Valley Wood Prods., Inc. v.\n\nNear, 876 A.2d 757, 762 (N.H. 2005).               No New Hampshire cases are\n\ndirectly on point, as the vast majority of noncompetition agreement\n\ncases considered by the state's supreme court have turned on other\n\nissues, such as the protection of employers' interest in customer\n\ngood will. See, e.g., Concord Orthopaedics Prof'l Ass'n v. Forbes,\n\n702 A.2d 1273, 1276 (N.H. 1997); Technical Aid Corp. v. Allen, 591\n\nA.2d 262, 266-67 (N.H. 1991).1\n\n\n       1\n          Both parties note a single case in which the New\nHampshire Supreme Court addressed a superficially similar attempt\nby an employer to enforce a covenant not to compete to prevent an\nemployee from working for a competitor in a narrow field, upholding\na district court's determination that the noncompetition agreement\n\n                                            -6-\n\f           New Hampshire courts have, however, articulated general\n\ncriteria by which we may assess ANSYS's claims:\n\n           To determine whether a restrictive covenant\n           ancillary to an employment contract is reasonable,\n           we engage in a three-part inquiry: first, whether\n           the restriction is greater than necessary to\n           protect the legitimate interests of the employer;\n           second, whether the restriction imposes an undue\n           hardship upon the employee; and third, whether the\n           restriction is injurious to the public interest.\n\nACAS Acquisitions (Precitech) Inc. v. Hobert, 923 A.2d 1076, 1084\n\n(N.H. 2007).      A covenant that fails any one of these criteria \"is\n\nunreasonable and unenforceable.\"          Merrimack Valley Wood Prods.,\n\nInc., 876 A.2d at 762; see also id. at 763-64 (affirming that an\n\nagreement that broadly barred an employee from working with any\n\nclient who had transacted business with his employer in the past\n\nyear was unenforceable, reasoning that it went \"far beyond the\n\ndefendant's sphere of customer goodwill, and was more restrictive\n\nthan necessary to protect the plaintiffs' legitimate interests\").\n\nNew   Hampshire    courts   have   further   clarified   that   employers'\n\n\n\nat issue was enforceable. See ACAS Acquisitions (Precitech) Inc.\nv. Hobert, 923 A.2d 1076, 1089 (N.H. 2007). However, ACAS relied\non a variety of facts not presented by this case. Id. at 1087-89.\n     Moreover, to the limited extent that ANSYS relies on ACAS, it\nmischaracterizes the court's holding. The court did not, as ANSYS\nsuggests, \"presume[] irreparable harm from the presumed use of . .\n. information.\"    Instead, it cited specific evidence \"that the\ndefendant intended to use his knowledge learned at [plaintiff's\ncompany] to help\" his new employer, id. at 1083, 1085 (internal\nquotation marks omitted), and affirmed the district court's holding\nthat the defendant's \"use and disclosure of . . . information to or\nfor the benefit of [his new employer] has caused, and will continue\nto cause,\" the plaintiff harm, id. 1087.\n\n                                    -7-\n\f\"legitimate   interests\"   include   \"trade   secrets   that   have   been\n\ncommunicated to the employee during the course of employment\" and\n\n\"confidential information communicated by the employer to the\n\nemployee, but not involving trade secrets.\" Syncom Indus., Inc. v.\n\nWood, 920 A.2d 1178, 1185 (N.H. 2007).\n\n          Whether ANSYS's construction of the noncompete clause was\n\nreasonable–-that is, whether it went no further than was necessary\n\nto protect its legitimate interests, imposed no undue hardship on\n\nDr. Caraeni, and was not inconsistent with the public interest--all\n\ninvolve policy choices that have not been explicitly decided in\n\nthis context by the New Hampshire courts or legislature.          Absent\n\nsuch guidance, we cannot say ANSYS has clearly demonstrated its\n\nlikelihood of success on the breach of contract claim, nor can we\n\nconclude that the district court abused its discretion by finding\n\nthat ANSYS had failed to make this showing.\n\n          We also cannot say that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion when it found ANSYS had not shown the likelihood of\n\nirreparable injury.   ANSYS's claim that its showing of breach was\n\nsufficient to show irreparable harm again assumes that the covenant\n\nnot to compete is enforceable.       In any event, we reject ANSYS's\n\nsuggestion at oral argument that because of the difficulty of\n\nproving damages from breach of the covenant, as opposed to damages\n\nfrom the actual use of confidential material, we should deem its\n\nremedy at law inadequate. We further reject its related claim that\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fthis alleged inadequacy would justify equitable relief for breach\n\nof the covenant without any showing of injury.              New Hampshire law\n\nhas not adopted that approach.\n\n              As to the district court's analysis of ANSYS's injury, we\n\nwill accept arguendo that Dr. Caraeni had access to confidential\n\nproprietary information.       The district court concluded that even\n\nwere that so, \"Ansys has failed to demonstrate that [Dr. Caraeni]\n\nis likely to use that [confidential] information during the course\n\nof his employment at CDNA.\"        This conclusion was based on factual\n\nfindings, which we cannot set aside unless they constituted clear\n\nerror.      E.g., McClure, 386 F.3d at 41.\n\n              The district court explained that it found credible the\n\ntestimony of Dr. Wayne Smith, who is the general manager of CDNA.\n\nIn particular, the court accepted three aspects of Dr. Smith's\n\ntestimony: (1) \"that CDNA maintains and enforces a strict policy\n\npreventing its employees from using confidential and trade secret\n\ninformation they may have acquired from prior employers;\" (2) that\n\nDr. Caraeni had not been assigned and, in the near term (that is,\n\nto the May 2010 date for expiration of the one-year period since\n\nhis departure from ANSYS), will not be assigned \"to perform any\n\nwork   at    CDNA   that   might   allow   him   to   use    any   of   ANSYS's\n\nconfidential or trade secret information;\" and (3) that any trade\n\nsecret or confidential information Dr. Caraeni had acquired at\n\nANSYS would not be useful to work on CDNA's CFD software because of\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fthe   different    architecture     of    the   two   companies'    respective\n\nsoftware codes.      ANSYS, Inc., 2009 WL 4403745, at *6.\n\n           ANSYS emphatically attacks the third of these findings in\n\nparticular and urges that it constitutes clear error.2                 Even if\n\nthere were reason to be skeptical of the third finding--after all,\n\nCDNA chose to hire Dr. Caraeni for reasons that may have included\n\nwhat he learned in his prior employment--that would not make the\n\nfinding clear error. More pertinently, the district court reasoned\n\nDr.   Caraeni   would   not     perform   any   tasks   that   might   require\n\nconfidential information he had obtained at ANSYS.                 The court's\n\nfirst two factual findings support its conclusion, and we cannot\n\nsay that they were clearly erroneous.\n\n           There is no need to discuss the myriad other arguments\n\nthe parties have pressed.\n\n                                     II.\n\n           The district court's denial of the preliminary injunction\n\nis affirmed.      So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n      2\n          ANSYS also argues that the district court erred in\ncrediting Dr. Smith's testimony, urging that his statements were\nself-serving and speculative. Given our traditional deference to\ndistrict court credibility determinations, e.g., Jennings v. Jones,\n587 F.3d 430, 444 (1st Cir. 2009), we cannot say the court's\ndecision was an abuse of discretion.\n\n                                     -10-\n\f",

It reads, in relevant part, \"I agree that for a\n\nperiod of one (1) year following termination of my employment with\n\n[ANSYS], I will not become an employee . . . or in any way engage\n\nin or contribute my knowledge to a competitor of [ANSYS].\"\n\n           Perhaps recognizing how poorly drafted this clause is,\n\nANSYS offers two pertinent narrowing constructions: (1) the clause\n\nonly applies to those employees who have access to confidential\n\ninformation or trade secrets--thus, the clause would not apply to,\n\nfor instance, a maintenance worker; and (2) the clause only applies\n\nto employees who are in a position to use that information at their\n\nnew employer.     This interpretation, of course, requires judicial\n\nreconstruction of the broadly drafted contract language.\n\n           Against the backdrop of these constructions, ANSYS argues\n\nit has to show two things, and no more, to establish breach of\n\ncontract: that Dr. Caraeni had access to confidential information\n\nwhile at ANSYS and that he is in a position to use this knowledge\n\nat CDNA.   ANSYS asserts it met this burden on the evidence produced\n\nat the one-day evidentiary hearing before the district court.\n\n           As a result, ANSYS argues, it has shown Dr. Caraeni was\n\nin breach of his contract and that it will succeed on the merits of\n\nits claims.     Since likelihood of success on the merits normally\n\nweighs heavily in the preliminary injunction calculus, ANSYS urges\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fthis showing is sufficient to merit preliminary injunctive relief.\n\nANSYS also argues that proving breach, and no more, was sufficient\n\nto demonstrate irreparable harm and further support its request for\n\nthe preliminary injunction.\n\n            ANSYS asserts that holding it to any greater showing on\n\nthe likelihood of success or irreparable harm would effectively\n\neliminate the noncompete clause from the contract. ANSYS says that\n\nfor the noncompete clause to have any meaning, the clause must be\n\nread to give ANSYS some greater benefit than the protection it\n\nenjoys under common law for its trade secrets and confidential\n\ninformation.     ANSYS   urges   that   the   district   court   erred   by\n\nanalyzing this case as though it was simply a trade secrets case.\n\nAfter all, ANSYS notes, it did not seek a preliminary injunction on\n\nits trade secrets claim.\n\n            ANSYS's argument about the import of its contract clause\n\nis not irrational and one might well be sympathetic to it.

Conn.\n\n1976) (finding a covenant not to compete for eighteen months\n\nreasonable under New York law to the extent that it barred similar\n\nemployment at a direct competitor working to develop an identical\n\nproduct).    As Judge Newman observed in that case, it is unclear\n\nthat the test for enforcing a noncompetition covenant should be the\n\nsame as would be used in obtaining an injunction to bar disclosure\n\nof trade secrets or an injunction to enforce a covenant not to\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fdisclose         trade     secrets.          The   court   explained,      \"[t]he\n\nnon-competition covenant adds something to the protection available\n\nto the employer beyond what he would expect from the normal\n\nincidents of the employer-employee relationship or from a secrecy\n\nagreement.\"            Id. at 844.        Here, the contract clause could be\n\njustified as a prophylaxis, protecting ANSYS in a situation that\n\ncreated a high risk of disclosure of its confidential information\n\nto a competitor.          See id. at 845.\n\n                 Whether New Hampshire law would enforce an agreement so\n\nconstrued is quite a different matter.              ANSYS's arguments presume\n\nits noncompetition clause is enforceable.

Absent\n\nsuch guidance, we cannot say ANSYS has clearly demonstrated its\n\nlikelihood of success on the breach of contract claim, nor can we\n\nconclude that the district court abused its discretion by finding\n\nthat ANSYS had failed to make this showing.\n\n          We also cannot say that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion when it found ANSYS had not shown the likelihood of\n\nirreparable injury.   ANSYS's claim that its showing of breach was\n\nsufficient to show irreparable harm again assumes that the covenant\n\nnot to compete is enforceable.       In any event, we reject ANSYS's\n\nsuggestion at oral argument that because of the difficulty of\n\nproving damages from breach of the covenant, as opposed to damages\n\nfrom the actual use of confidential material, we should deem its\n\nremedy at law inadequate. We further reject its related claim that\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fthis alleged inadequacy would justify equitable relief for breach\n\nof the covenant without any showing of injury.              New Hampshire law\n\nhas not adopted that approach.\n\n              As to the district court's analysis of ANSYS's injury, we\n\nwill accept arguendo that Dr. Caraeni had access to confidential\n\nproprietary information.       The district court concluded that even\n\nwere that so, \"Ansys has failed to demonstrate that [Dr. Caraeni]\n\nis likely to use that [confidential] information during the course\n\nof his employment at CDNA.\"        This conclusion was based on factual\n\nfindings, which we cannot set aside unless they constituted clear\n\nerror.      E.g., McClure, 386 F.3d at 41.\n\n              The district court explained that it found credible the\n\ntestimony of Dr. Wayne Smith, who is the general manager of CDNA.\n\nIn particular, the court accepted three aspects of Dr. Smith's\n\ntestimony: (1) \"that CDNA maintains and enforces a strict policy\n\npreventing its employees from using confidential and trade secret\n\ninformation they may have acquired from prior employers;\" (2) that\n\nDr. Caraeni had not been assigned and, in the near term (that is,\n\nto the May 2010 date for expiration of the one-year period since\n\nhis departure from ANSYS), will not be assigned \"to perform any\n\nwork   at    CDNA   that   might   allow   him   to   use    any   of   ANSYS's\n\nconfidential or trade secret information;\" and (3) that any trade\n\nsecret or confidential information Dr. Caraeni had acquired at\n\nANSYS would not be useful to work on CDNA's CFD software because of\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fthe   different    architecture     of    the   two   companies'    respective\n\nsoftware codes.

More pertinently, the district court reasoned\n\nDr.   Caraeni   would   not     perform   any   tasks   that   might   require\n\nconfidential information he had obtained at ANSYS.
