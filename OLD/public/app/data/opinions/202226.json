Marchand-Quintero, with whom Francisco Ortiz-Santini\nwas on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           May 23, 2006\n\f           LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.       This case requires us to decide\n\nwhether a passenger's state tort claim against an international air\n\ncarrier was preempted by the Warsaw Convention1 and therefore\n\nproperly dismissed by the district court.            For the reasons set\n\nforth below, we vacate the district court's judgment granting the\n\nmotion to dismiss and remand for further proceedings consistent\n\nwith this opinion.\n\n                                     I.\n\n           The following facts are drawn from the complaint. Michel\n\nAcevedo-Reinoso is a citizen of Cuba with legal residence in the\n\nUnited States. At the time of this action, Acevedo-Reinoso resided\n\nin Puerto Rico.         In October 2002, Acevedo-Reinoso, a banking\n\nexecutive, was invited to participate in an annual convention\n\nhosted by the Mortgage Loan Officers Association (\"Association\") in\n\nMadrid, Spain.    The Association contracted with a travel agency,\n\nThe   Travel   Place,   to   coordinate    all   travel    arrangements   for\n\nattendees to the convention.         The Travel Place assured Acevedo-\n\nReinoso that he would not require a visa, and instead need only\n\nshow his Cuban passport and U.S. resident alien card upon entry to\n\nSpain.   On November 13, 2002, Acevedo-Reinoso and his partner,\n\nMaria    Pacheco-Gonzalez,       a     U.S.      citizen     (collectively,\n\n\n\n1\n  The Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to\nInternational Transportation by Air, Oct. 12, 1929, 49 Stat. 3000,\n3014, T.S. 876 (1934), note following 49 U.S.C. § 40105\n[hereinafter \"Warsaw Convention\" or \"Convention\"].\n\n                                     -2-\n\f\"Plaintiffs\"), arrived at the Iberia Líneas Aéreas Españolas, S.A.\n\n(\"Iberia\") airline counter in Puerto Rico to check in.            The Iberia\n\nagent   informed   Acevedo-Reinoso       and   Pacheco-Gonzalez    that   all\n\nimmigration documents were in place and gave them their tickets and\n\nboarding passes.\n\n           Upon arriving in Spain on November 14, 2002, a Spanish\n\nimmigration officer requested passports from all passengers.              When\n\nAcevedo-Reinoso showed his Cuban passport, the Spanish government\n\nordered his immediate detention.         Acevedo-Reinoso was questioned,\n\nrepresented by counsel appointed by the Spanish government, and\n\ndetained with other allegedly illegal immigrants in a closed room\n\nin the airport. Meanwhile, Pacheco-Gonzalez suffered great anguish\n\nat seeing her partner detained in front of his peers in the banking\n\nindustry, mocked by Spanish immigration officers, and humiliated.\n\nAcevedo-Reinoso's    appointed    counsel      provided   him   with   several\n\ndocuments for his review.      At the behest of a Spanish officer who\n\ntold him the documents were for his own benefit, Acevedo-Reinoso\n\nsigned the documents without reading them, and was subsequently\n\ntold that he would be deported to his country of origin – Cuba.\n\nAcevedo-Reinoso     suffered     great    anguish    thinking     about    the\n\npunishment he would face at the hands of Cuban authorities upon\n\nreturning to a country he was forced to leave many years ago, and\n\nthe suffering – financial and otherwise – of his partner and two\n\nchildren who would be forced to live without him in Puerto Rico.\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f           Later that evening, Acevedo-Reinoso was taken to another\n\nroom where he was strip-searched and humiliated by a female Spanish\n\nofficer.     He was then taken to a detention room with hundreds of\n\nallegedly illegal immigrants, where he was served his first meal of\n\nthe day and was ordered to pass the night in a cold room that\n\nincluded a row of bunk beds without sheets or blankets.            During\n\nthis time, Acevedo-Reinoso observed Spanish officers beating a\n\nyoung adolescent from Ecuador who stood up to visit the restroom.\n\nThe following morning, after speaking with Pacheco-Gonzalez about\n\na letter she had obtained from the General Manager of the hotel in\n\nSpain assuming responsibility for him during his stay, Acevedo-\n\nReinoso inquired whether he could be sent back to Puerto Rico.\n\nSpanish officers declined to accept this proposition.            Pacheco-\n\nGonzalez was extremely nervous about her partner's future and the\n\nwell-being    of   herself   and   her   children.   The   following   day,\n\nAcevedo-Reinoso was escorted by several Spanish guards to an Iberia\n\nairplane bound for San Juan, Puerto Rico, detained until airline\n\ncrew boarded the airplane, and thereafter released.\n\n           As a result of the humiliation, emotional distress, and\n\nmental anguish they experienced, Plaintiffs sued Iberia, a foreign\n\nentity, in federal court, alleging negligence under Puerto Rico\n\nlaw.2   On February 25, 2003, Iberia brought a motion to dismiss for\n\n\n\n2\n  Plaintiffs also sued The Travel Place and its owner in the\nSuperior Court of Puerto Rico.\n\n                                     -4-\n\ffailure to join as indispensable parties The Travel Company and its\n\nowner.       That motion was denied.              Iberia then filed its answer to\n\nPlaintiffs' complaint. After discovery and the entry of a pretrial\n\norder,       Iberia     filed     a    second     motion        to    dismiss,     based      on\n\nPlaintiffs' failure to state a claim under the Convention, and, in\n\nthe    alternative,       under       Puerto    Rico      law.        The    district   court\n\ndismissed Plaintiffs' action for failure to state a claim under the\n\nConvention.         Acevedo-Reinoso appealed.3\n\n                                               II.\n\n               We review the district court's grant of Iberia's motion\n\nto dismiss de novo.             See SFW Arecibo, Ltd. v. Rodríguez, 415 F.3d\n\n135, 138 (1st Cir. 2005).                To that end, we accept as true the\n\nwell-pleaded factual allegations of the complaint, drawing all\n\nreasonable inferences in favor of the non-movant, Acevedo-Reinoso.\n\nSee    id.    at    138-39.       \"Our     goal      is    to    determine       whether   the\n\ncomplaint,         so   read,    alleges       facts      sufficient        to   make   out    a\n\ncognizable claim.          In so doing, we are free to affirm on any basis\n\nsupported by the record.\"               Carroll v. Xerox Corp., 294 F.3d 231,\n\n241    (1st    Cir.     2002)     (internal       citations          and    quotation   marks\n\nomitted).\n\n\n\n\n3\n    Pacheco-Gonzalez did not join this appeal.\n\n                                               -5-\n\fA.          Applicability of the Warsaw Convention\n\n            1.      The Warsaw Convention\n\n            The Convention, as amended by the Montreal Agreement,4\n\ngoverns the liability of international air carriers for \"passenger\n\ninjuries occurring 'on board the aircraft or in the course of any\n\nof the operations of embarking or disembarking.'\"5             El Al Israel\n\nAirlines,    525   U.S.   at   172   (quoting   Convention   art.   17);   see\n\nLangadinos v. American Airlines, Inc., 199 F.3d 68, 70 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).    The Convention is preemptive:         a carrier is not subject to\n\nliability under local law for passenger injuries \"covered by\" the\n\n\n4\n  While \"[t]he United States initially adhered to the Warsaw\nConvention on October 29, 1934,\" McCarthy v. Northwest Airlines,\nInc., 56 F.3d 313, 316 n.2 (1st Cir. 1995), all references to the\nConvention herein are to that document as modified by Montreal\nProtocol No. 4. Montreal Protocol No. 4 to Amend the Convention\nfor the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International\nCarriage by Air, Signed at Warsaw on Oct. 12, 1929, as amended by\nthe Protocol Done at the Hague on Sept. 8, 1955 [hereinafter\nProtocol No. 4] reprinted in S. Exec. Rep. No. 105-20, pp. 21-32\n(1998). This protocol, \"ratified by the Senate on September 28,\n1998, amends Article 24 [of the Convention] to read, in relevant\npart: 'In the carriage of passengers and baggage, any action for\ndamages, however founded, can only be brought subject to the\nconditions and limits set out in this Convention . . . .'\" El Al\nIsrael Airlines, Ltd. v. Tsui Yuan Tseng, 525 U.S. 155, 174 (1999)\n(quoting Convention art. 24, as amended by Montreal Protocol No.\n4).\n5\n    Article 17 of the Convention states, in relevant part, that\n\n       [t]he carrier shall be liable for damage sustained in the\n       event of the death or wounding of a passenger or any\n       other bodily injury suffered by a passenger, if the\n       accident which caused the damage so sustained took place\n       on board the aircraft or in the course of any of the\n       operations of embarking or disembarking.\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fConvention, that is, \"all personal injury cases stemming from\n\noccurrences on board an aircraft or in embarking or disembarking.\"\n\nEl Al Israel Airlines, 525 U.S. at 168 (adopting Government's\n\nconstruction of Convention); see also Convention art. 24 (stating\n\nthat in personal injury cases \"covered by\" the Convention, \"any\n\naction for damages, however founded, can only be brought subject to\n\nthe conditions and limits set out in this convention\"6).         The\n\ncorollary is also true:\n\n     the Convention's preemptive effect on local law extends\n     no further than the Convention's own substantive scope.\n     A carrier, therefore, is indisputably subject to\n     liability under local law for injuries arising outside of\n     that scope:    e.g., for passenger injuries occurring\n     before   any  of   the   operations   of   embarking   or\n     disembarking.\n\nEl Al Israel Airlines, 525 U.S. at 172 (internal citations and\n\nquotation marks omitted); see also Commercial Union Ins. Co. v.\n\nAlitalia Airlines, S.p.A., 347 F.3d 448, 456 (2d Cir. 2003) (\"As a\n\ntreaty adhered to by the United States, it is the supreme law of\n\nthe land and trumps local law when it applies.\") (emphasis added).\n\n          \"Treaty interpretation,\" we have noted, \"is a purely\n\nlegal exercise.\" McCarthy, 56 F.3d at 317 (interpreting meaning of\n\n\"embarking\" and \"disembarking\" under Convention).   Therefore, the\n\nquestion [of] whether a passenger's injury was sustained \"on board\n\n\n6\n  Article 24 of the Convention states that \"[i]n the cases covered\nby article 17 [i.e., personal injury cases],\" Convention art.\n24(2), \"any action for damages, however founded, can only be\nbrought subject to the conditions and limits set out in this\nconvention,\" Convention art. 24(1).\n\n                               -7-\n\fthe aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking\n\nor disembarking,\" Convention art. 17, \"is a question of law to be\n\ndecided by the court\" based on the facts of each case, Marotte v.\n\nAmerican Airlines, Inc., 296 F.3d 1255, 1259 (11th Cir. 2002). See\n\nalso Schmidkunz v. Scandinavian Airlines Sys., 628 F.2d 1205, 1207\n\n(9th   Cir.    1980)   (same).   Since   \"[t]he   terms   'embarking'   and\n\n'disembarking' are not specifically defined in the Convention,\"\n\nMarotte, 296 F.3d at 1259, and absent some direction from the\n\nSupreme Court, which has not yet had occasion to define them, we\n\nhave found \"(1) the passenger's activity at the time of injury, (2)\n\nhis or her whereabouts when injured, and (3) the extent to which\n\nthe carrier was exercising control . . . highly relevant in\n\ndetermining the applicability of [the Convention].\"          McCarthy, 56\n\nF.3d at 317.\n\n              If the Convention applies (and local law is thereby\n\npreempted), the next question is whether the carrier is liable\n\nunder the Convention.       This inquiry involves a determination of\n\nwhether there was an \"accident,\" i.e., \"an unexpected or unusual\n\nevent or happening that is external to the passenger,\" Air France\n\nv. Saks, 470 U.S. 392, 405 (1985); whether the passenger suffered\n\na compensable injury, i.e., \"death, physical injury, or physical\n\nmanifestation of injury,\" Eastern Airlines, Inc. v. Floyd, 499 U.S.\n\n530, 552 (1991); and whether the accident was a proximate cause of\n\nthe passenger's injury, see Langadinos, 199 F.3d at 71.\n\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\f           2.      The District Court Proceeding\n\n           The district court held that Plaintiffs' Puerto Rico tort\n\nclaim was preempted by the Convention because Plaintiffs failed to\n\nstate a claim for liability under the Convention. According to the\n\ndistrict court, \"plaintiffs may not sue a carrier pursuant to state\n\nlaw if they are barred from recovering under the convention.\"          The\n\ndistrict court noted that Plaintiffs did not allege that \"they\n\nsuffered death, physical injury or physical manifestation of an\n\ninjury\" – one of the requirements for proving liability under the\n\nConvention.7      Rather,   Plaintiffs    alleged   only   \"humiliation,\n\nembarrassment, and great anguish\" – none of which is compensable\n\nunder the Convention. Since Plaintiffs were barred from recovering\n\nunder the Convention, the court held that their claim under Puerto\n\nRico law was likewise barred.\n\n           3.      Application of the Warsaw Convention\n\n           Echoing the district court, Iberia notes that since\n\n\"[t]he   Warsaw   Convention's   dispositions   provide    the   exclusive\n\nsource of an airline's liability in international flights claims,\"\n\nAcevedo-Reinoso's claim falls short because he does not allege any\n\nphysical injury or an \"accident.\"        Acevedo-Reinoso, on the other\n\nhand, argues that the court erroneously assumed the Convention's\n\n7\n  The district court noted that since Plaintiffs' claim failed to\nsatisfy the injury requirement for liability under the Convention,\nthe court did not need to decide whether Plaintiffs' claim\nsatisfied the \"accident\" requirement for liability – i.e., whether\nPlaintiffs alleged that their injury resulted from an unexpected or\nunusual event or happening external to the passenger.\n\n                                   -9-\n\fapplicability without resolving the threshold issue of whether his\n\ninjuries were \"sustained . . . on board the aircraft or in the\n\ncourse of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking.\"8\n\nConvention art. 17.    According to Acevedo-Reinoso, the Convention\n\ndoes not apply – and his Puerto Rico tort claim is therefore not\n\npreempted – because he was not embarking or disembarking when he\n\nsustained   his   injuries.   Rather,   Acevedo-Reinoso   argues,   his\n\ninjuries were sustained \"in Spain in a detention jail and [in] . .\n\n. being deported back to Puerto Rico in front of all the members of\n\nthe Association.\"\n\n            We agree with Acevedo-Reinoso that the district court\n\nerroneously conflated the applicability of the Convention with\n\nliability under the Convention.     The Convention's applicability\n\nrests on a determination of whether the passenger's injury occurred\n\n\"on board the aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of\n\nembarking or disembarking.\" Convention art. 17. If the Convention\n\napplies in a particular case, it is preemptive, and the trier of\n\nfact must then determine whether the carrier is liable under the\n\nConvention.   See El Al Israel, 525 U.S. at 161 (\"[R]ecovery for a\n\n\n8\n  Acevedo-Reinoso also argues that the district court should never\nhave reached the merits of Iberia's second motion to dismiss\ninvoking the applicability of the Convention.         According to\nAcevedo-Reinoso, Iberia waived the arguments raised in the second\nmotion to dismiss by not asserting them earlier in the proceedings.\nWe are unpersuaded by this argument but see no need to discuss it\nin any detail since we decide this appeal in Acevedo-Reinoso's\nfavor on the merits.\n\n\n                                -10-\n\fpersonal injury on board [an] aircraft or in the course of any of\n\nthe operations of embarking or disembarking, if not allowed under\n\nthe Convention, is not available at all.\") (internal citation and\n\nquotation marks omitted); see id. at 174 (\"[I]n all questions\n\nrelating to the carrier's liability, it is the provisions of the\n\n[C]onvention which apply and [] the passenger does not have access\n\nto any other remedies, whether under the common law or otherwise,\n\nwhich may be available within the particular country where he\n\nchooses to raise his action.\" (quoting Sidhu v. British Airways\n\nplc, [1997] 1 All E. R., 193 at 201, 207)).          If the Convention is\n\nnot applicable, it is not preemptive, and the passenger is free to\n\npursue his or her claim under local law.            Id. at 171-72 (\"[T]he\n\nConvention    addresses    and   concerns,   only   and    exclusively,    the\n\nairline's liability for passenger injuries occurring 'on board the\n\naircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or\n\ndisembarking.'\" (quoting Convention art. 17)).\n\n           Here, the district court assumed the applicability of the\n\nConvention, stating that \"pursuant to El Al Israel, plaintiffs'\n\nonly basis of redress is the Convention's passenger liability\n\nprovision.\"       But El Al Israel does not support such an assumption.\n\nIn that case, applicability of the Convention was not at issue\n\nbecause the parties explicitly agreed that \"the episode-in-suit\n\noccurred     in    international   transportation     in    the   course    of\n\nembarking.\"       El Al Israel, 525 U.S. at 167.           In this case, by\n\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fcontrast, the parties dispute whether Acevedo-Reinoso's damages\n\nwere sustained \"in the course of any of the operations of embarking\n\nor disembarking,\" and, thus, whether the Convention is applicable.\n\n           Acevedo-Reinoso argues that Iberia's failure to advise\n\nhim at the ticket counter of the need for a visa to enter Spain\n\npreceded his boarding the plane, and that his subsequent arrest\n\nupon arrival in Spain came well after he disembarked from the\n\nplane.    Iberia, on the other hand, contends that its alleged\n\nfailure to warn Acevedo-Reinoso at the airport in Puerto Rico and\n\nhis ensuing arrest in Spain took place during the process of\n\nembarking and disembarking, respectively.             Because the district\n\ncourt    did   not   address   this     dispute,    there   was     never    any\n\ndetermination that the Convention was applicable and therefore\n\npreemptive of Acevedo-Reinoso's claim.            See Marotte, 296 F.3d at\n\n1260-61 (holding that the Convention preempted plaintiffs' state\n\nlaw claims where plaintiffs' injuries \"occurred in the process of\n\nembarking, as contemplated by the Warsaw Convention\"); see also\n\nMcCarthy, 56 F.3d at 317 (holding that plaintiff was not engaged in\n\nthe course of \"embarking\" under the Convention, based on \"(1) the\n\npassenger's    activity   at   the    time   of   injury,   (2)   his   or   her\n\nwhereabouts when injured, and (3) the extent to which the carrier\n\nwas exercising control at the moment of injury\").                 The district\n\ncourt therefore erred in dismissing Acevedo-Reinoso's claim under\n\nthe Convention without first determining whether Acevedo-Reinoso's\n\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\finjury   occurred     on   board     the   airplane   or   in    the   process   of\n\nembarking or disembarking.\n\nB.         Liability Under Puerto Rico Law\n\n           Even if the Convention is not applicable and therefore\n\nnot preemptive, Iberia asks us to affirm on a different basis,\n\narguing that the motion to dismiss was properly granted because\n\nAcevedo-Reinoso does not state a claim under Puerto Rico law.\n\n           1.         Contract Claim\n\n           Iberia contends that while Acevedo-Reinoso characterizes\n\nhis claim as sounding only in tort, his claim also sounds in\n\ncontract, based on the allegation in the complaint that Iberia\n\n\"breached its contract to travel with Acevedo.\"9                  Iberia further\n\nargues that, as between these two sources of law, \"in Puerto Rico\n\ncontractual     law   []    control[s]     the   scenario       depicted    in   the\n\ncomplaint.      As    a    result,    Acevedo    cannot    resort      to   general\n\nprinciples of tort law but must submit [himself] to the provisions\n\napplicable to contracts.\"          Furthermore, because \"the parties did\n\nnot contract for Iberia to assume the duty of verifying that\n\nAcevedo's papers were in order for entering Spain, a task that was\n\nAcevedo's personal obligation to comply with,\" Iberia argues that\n\nAcevedo-Reinoso's claim fails to state a claim for breach of\n\n\n\n\n9\n  According to Iberia, \"[t]he well-pleaded allegations []form a\nbasic contract: Acevedo would pay a specific monetary amount to\nIberia, in exchange for safe transportation to Madrid, Spain.\"\n\n                                       -13-\n\fcontract under Article 1054 of the Civil Code of Puerto Rico, P.R.\n\nLaws Ann., Tit. 31, § 3018.10\n\n            Aside from language in the complaint briefly alluding to\n\na contractual claim, Acevedo-Reinoso nowhere argues that Iberia\n\nbreached a contract. On the contrary, Acevedo-Reinoso asserts that\n\nhis claim \"is without a doubt one in tort,\" and states in the\n\ncomplaint that his state law claims are \"based on Article 1802 of\n\nthe Civil Code of Puerto Rico\" – the Puerto Rico statute governing\n\ntort claims, P.R. Laws Ann., Tit. 31, § 5141.11    Nevertheless, even\n\nif we assume that Acevedo-Reinoso's claim sounds in both tort and\n\ncontract, it does not follow that Puerto Rico contract law provides\n\nthe remedy.    In fact, the opposite is true:    where the event that\n\ncaused the damage results from the breach of both a contractual\n\n\n10\n     Article 1054 states, in relevant part, that\n\n       those who in any manner whatsoever act in contravention\n       of the stipulations of [their contractual obligations],\n       shall be subject to indemnify for the losses and damages\n       caused thereby.\n\nP.R. Laws Ann., Tit. 31, § 3018; see also P.R. Laws Ann., Tit. 31,\n§ 2994 (\"Obligations arising from contracts have legal force\nbetween the contracting parties, and must be fulfilled in\naccordance with their stipulations.\").\n11\n     Article 1802 states in relevant part that\n\n       [a] person who by an act or omission causes damage to\n       another through fault or negligence shall be obliged to\n       repair the damage so done.\n\nP.R. Laws Ann., Tit. 31, § 5141.\n\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\fobligation as well as a noncontractual duty not to cause harm to\n\nanother, Puerto Rico law holds that an action for damages for\n\nbreach of contract does not lie.       According to the Puerto Rico\n\nSupreme Court:\n\n     an action for damages for breach of contract [Article\n     1054] only lies when the damage suffered exclusively\n     arises as a consequence of the breach of an obligation\n     specifically agreed upon, which damage would not occur\n     without the existence of a contract. However . . . a\n     claim for noncontractual damages resulting from the\n     breach of a contract lies if the act that caused the\n     damage constitutes a breach of the general duty not to\n     injure anyone and, at the same time, a breach of\n     contract.\n\nRamos Lozada v. Orientalist Rattan Furniture, Inc., 130 P.R. Dec.\n\n712, 727, 1992 P.R.-Eng. 755597 (P.R. 1992) (emphasis added).\n\nIberia's argument regarding the application of Puerto Rico contract\n\nlaw is therefore unavailing.\n\n          2.       Tort Claim\n\n          Iberia argues that even if Puerto Rico tort law applies\n\nto Acevedo-Reinoso's claim, his claim should still be dismissed.\n\nBy contrast, Acevedo-Reinoso argues that the complaint adequately\n\nstates a claim for negligence.      We agree with Acevedo-Reinoso.\n\nPuerto Rico tort law \"imposes responsibility for damages caused by\n\nnegligence or fault. The necessary elements to prevail in [such a]\n\ntort action are:   (1) a negligent act or omission, (2) damages, and\n\n(3) a causal relationship between them.\" Irvine, IRG v. Murad Skin\n\nResearch Labs., Inc., 194 F.3d 313, 321-22 (1st Cir. 1999).     The\n\ncomplaint alleges facts addressing each of these elements, stating\n\n\n                                -15-\n\fthat Iberia's negligent acts or omissions – i.e., its \"fail[ure] to\n\nadvise [Acevedo-Reinoso] that he needed a visa in order to enter\n\nSpain\"   –    caused    Acevedo-Reinoso     to   be   \"detained    by   Spanish\n\nauthorities in Spain, humiliated in front of his peers from the\n\nbanking industry, and subjected to extensive mental anguish and\n\nsufferings.\"\n\n              Iberia's argument that an air carrier has no duty to\n\nadvise passengers under Puerto Rico law is foreclosed by our\n\ndecision in Compagnie Nationale Air France v. Castano, 358 F.2d 203\n\n(1st Cir. 1966).        In that case, three passengers and a relative\n\nsued an air carrier under Puerto Rico tort law for failing to\n\nadvise them that they needed visas to enter Spain.            We opined that\n\n       the Puerto Rico court would . . . hold [that] where there\n       was evidence that the defendant, as an inducement to\n       plaintiffs to purchase passage, had held itself out as a\n       tourist or travel agency, and had negligently failed to\n       provide the information that plaintiffs had reasonably\n       been led to expect, [] damages for negligence would\n       include . . . proximate, though unforeseeable, injury of\n       any sort.\n\nId. at 209.     Applying this reasoning to the facts of that case, we\n\nheld   that    \"the    unforseen   suffering     occasioned   by   defendant's\n\nfailure to perform of the type here claimed can be compensated.\"\n\nId. We noted, however, that \"there was a substantial factual issue\n\nwhether this damage was proximate, and whether the plaintiff or\n\nplaintiffs reasonably attempted to mitigate the damages.\"               Id.\n\n              Here, Acevedo-Reinoso claims that he was injured by the\n\nfailure of an air carrier to advise him that he needed a visa to\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fenter Spain. The facts alleged by Acevedo-Reinoso in this case are\n\nnearly identical to those alleged by the passengers in Castano, and\n\nthus are sufficient to state a claim for the negligent failure to\n\nadvise under Puerto Rico tort law.12\n\n                                III.\n\n          In summary, we hold that the district court erred in\n\ngranting Iberia's motion to dismiss based on the preemptive effect\n\nof the Convention, without first determining whether the Convention\n\nin fact applied to this case.   On remand, the district court must\n\ndetermine whether Acevedo-Reinoso's injury occurred \"in the course\n\nof any of the operations of embarking or disembarking.\"     If the\n\ndistrict court answers this question in the affirmative, the\n\nConvention will apply and will preempt Acevedo-Reinoso's Puerto\n\nRico tort claim, thus limiting his claim to one that meets the\n\n\n12\n   Iberia's attempts to distinguish this case from Castano are\nunavailing. While Castano did not discuss the applicability of the\nConvention, our determination that Acevedo-Reinoso states a claim\nunder Puerto Rico tort law does not depend on the applicability of\nthe Convention. In fact, Acevedo-Reinoso's tort claim has effect\nonly to the extent that the Convention does not apply (and does not\npreempt the tort claim). In addition, while we vacated three of\nthe verdicts in Castano (and dismissed the fourth) and remanded for\na new trial, the lack of a final disposition in that case does not\nrender our holding under Puerto Rico law any less binding. See\nRoom v. Caribe Hilton Hotel, 659 F.2d 5, 8 n.3 (1st Cir. 1981)\n(relying on Castano for proposition that \"[u]nder Puerto Rico law\na plaintiff may recover damages for mental suffering\"). Finally,\nwhile it may be that \"Iberia was in no position to induce Acevedo\nto purchase passage\" and did not hold itself out \"as a tourist or\ntravel agency,\" these issues await further factual development at\nsummary judgment or trial. At this stage in the proceedings, for\nthe reasons discussed above, Acevedo-Reinoso has alleged sufficient\nfacts to overcome Iberia's motion to dismiss.\n\n                                -17-\n\frequirements of the Convention.            If, on the other hand, the\n\ndistrict   court   answers   this    question   in   the   negative,   the\n\nConvention will have no application and this case will go forward\n\non the elements of the tort claim set forth under Puerto Rico tort\n\nlaw.   We vacate the district court's judgment granting Iberia's\n\nmotion to dismiss and remand for further proceedings consistent\n\nwith this opinion.   Costs of appeal are awarded to appellant.\n\n           So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\f",

Michel Acevedo-Reinoso is a citizen of Cuba with legal residence in the United States. At the time of this action, Acevedo-Reinoso resided in Puerto Rico. In October 2002, Acevedo-Reinoso, a banking executive, was invited to participate in an annual convention hosted by the Mortgage Loan Officers Association (\"Association\") in Madrid, Spain. The Association contracted with a travel agency, The Travel Place, to coordinate all travel arrangements for attendees to the convention. The Travel Place assured Acevedo-Reinoso that he would not require a visa, and instead need only show his Cuban passport and U.S. resident alien card upon entry to Spain. On November 13, 2002, Acevedo-Reinoso and his partner, Maria Pacheco-Gonzalez, a U.S. citizen (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\"), arrived at the Iberia L&#237;neas A&#233;reas Espa&#241;olas, S.A. (\"Iberia\") airline counter in Puerto Rico to check in. The Iberia agent informed Acevedo-Reinoso and Pacheco-Gonzalez that all immigration documents were in place and gave them their tickets and boarding passes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon arriving in Spain on November 14, 2002, a Spanish immigration officer requested passports from all passengers. When Acevedo-Reinoso showed his Cuban passport, the Spanish government ordered his immediate detention. Acevedo-Reinoso was questioned, represented by counsel appointed by the Spanish government, and detained with other allegedly illegal immigrants in a closed room in the airport. Meanwhile, Pacheco-Gonzalez suffered great anguish at seeing her partner detained in front of his peers in the banking industry, mocked by Spanish immigration officers, and humiliated. Acevedo-Reinoso's appointed counsel provided him with several documents for his review. At the behest of a Spanish officer who told him the documents were for his own benefit, Acevedo-Reinoso signed the documents without reading them, and was subsequently told that he would be deported to his country of origin&#8212;Cuba. Acevedo-Reinoso suffered great anguish thinking about the punishment he would face at the hands of Cuban authorities upon returning to a country he was forced to leave many years ago, and the suffering&#8212;financial and otherwise&#8212;of his partner and two children who would be forced to live without him in Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that evening, Acevedo-Reinoso was taken to another room where he was strip-searched and humiliated by a female Spanish officer. He was then taken to a detention room with hundreds of allegedly illegal immigrants, where he was served his first meal of the day and was ordered to pass the night in a cold room that included a row of bunk beds without sheets or blankets. During this time, Acevedo-Reinoso observed Spanish officers beating a young adolescent from Ecuador who stood up to visit the restroom. The following morning, after speaking with Pacheco-Gonzalez about a letter she had obtained from the General Manager of the hotel in Spain assuming responsibility for him during his stay, Acevedo-Reinoso inquired whether he could be sent back to Puerto Rico. Spanish officers declined to accept this proposition. Pacheco-Gonzalez was extremely nervous about her partner's future and the well-being of herself and her children. The following day, Acevedo-Reinoso was escorted by several Spanish guards to an Iberia airplane bound for San Juan, Puerto Rico, detained until airline crew boarded the airplane, and thereafter released.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of the humiliation, emotional distress, and mental anguish they experienced, Plaintiffs sued Iberia, a foreign entity, in federal court, alleging negligence under Puerto Rico law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> On February 25, 2003, Iberia brought a motion to dismiss for failure to join as indispensable parties The Travel Company and its owner. That motion was denied. Iberia then filed its answer to Plaintiffs' complaint. After discovery and the entry of a pretrial order, Iberia filed a second motion to dismiss, based on Plaintiffs' failure to state a claim under the Convention, and, in the alternative, under Puerto Rico law. The district court dismissed Plaintiffs' action for failure to state a claim under the Convention. Acevedo-Reinoso appealed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's grant of Iberia's motion to dismiss de novo. <i>See SFW Arecibo, Ltd. v. Rodr&#237;guez,</i> 415 F.3d 135, 138 (1st Cir.2005). To that end, we accept as true the well-pleaded factual allegations of the complaint, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-movant, Acevedo-Reinoso. <i>See id.</i> at 138-39. \"Our goal is to determine whether the complaint, so read, alleges facts sufficient to make out a cognizable claim.

Applicability of the Warsaw Convention</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. The Warsaw Convention</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Convention, as amended by the Montreal Agreement,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> governs the liability of international air carriers for \"passenger injuries occurring `on board the aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking.'\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>El Al Israel Airlines,</i> 525 U.S. at 172, 119 S.Ct. 662 (quoting Convention art. 17); <i>see Langadinos v. American Airlines, Inc.,</i> 199 F.3d 68, 70 (1st Cir.2000). The Convention is preemptive: a carrier is not subject to liability under local law for passenger injuries \"covered by\" the Convention, that is, \"all personal injury cases stemming from occurrences on board an aircraft or in embarking or disembarking.\" <i>El Al Israel Airlines,</i> 525 U.S. at 168, 119 S.Ct. 662 (adopting Government's construction of Convention); <i>see also</i> Convention art. 24 (stating that in personal injury cases \"covered by\" the Convention, \"any action for damages, however founded, can only be brought subject to the conditions and limits set out in this convention\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>). The corollary is also true:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the Convention's preemptive effect on local law extends no further than the Convention's own substantive scope. A carrier, therefore, is indisputably subject to liability under local law for injuries arising outside of that scope: <i>e.g.,</i> for passenger injuries occurring before any of the operations of embarking or disembarking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>El Al Israel Airlines,</i> 525 U.S. at 172, 119 S.Ct. 662 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted); <i>see also Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Alitalia Airlines, S.p.A.,</i> 347 F.3d 448, 456 (2d Cir.2003) (\"As a treaty adhered to by the United States, it is the supreme law of the land and trumps local law <i>when it applies.</i>\") (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Treaty interpretation,\" we have noted, \"is a purely legal exercise.\" <i>McCarthy,</i> 56 F.3d at 317 (interpreting meaning of \"embarking\" and \"disembarking\" under Convention). Therefore, the question [of] whether a passenger's injury was sustained \"on board the aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking,\" Convention art. 17, \"is a question of law to be decided by the court\" based on the facts of each case, <i>Marotte v. American Airlines, Inc.,</i> 296 F.3d 1255, 1259 (11th Cir.2002). <i>See also Schmidkunz v. Scandinavian Airlines Sys.,</i> 628 F.2d 1205, 1207 (9th Cir. 1980) (same). Since \"[t]he terms `embarking' and `disembarking' are not specifically defined in the Convention,\" <i>Marotte,</i> 296 F.3d at 1259, and absent some direction from the Supreme Court, which has not yet had occasion to define them, we have found \"(1) the passenger's activity at the time of injury, (2) his or her whereabouts when injured, and (3) the extent to which the carrier was exercising control ... highly relevant in determining the applicability of [the Convention].\" <i>McCarthy,</i> 56 F.3d at 317.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the Convention applies (and local law is thereby preempted), the next question is whether the carrier is liable under the Convention. This inquiry involves a determination of whether there was an \"accident,\" i.e., \"an unexpected or unusual event or happening that is external to the passenger,\" <i>Air France v. Saks,</i> 470 U.S. 392, 405, 105 S.Ct. 1338, 84 L.Ed.2d 289 (1985); whether the passenger suffered a compensable injury, i.e., \"death, physical injury, or physical manifestation of injury,\" <i>Eastern Airlines, Inc. v. Floyd,</i> 499 U.S. 530, 552, 111 S.Ct. 1489, 113 L.Ed.2d 569 (1991); and whether the accident was a proximate cause of the passenger's injury, <i>see Langadinos,</i> 199 F.3d at 71.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. The District Court Proceeding</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held that Plaintiffs' Puerto Rico tort claim was preempted by the Convention because Plaintiffs failed to state a claim for liability under the Convention. According to the district court, \"plaintiffs may not sue a carrier pursuant to state law if they are barred from recovering under the convention.\" The district court noted that Plaintiffs did not allege that \"they suffered death, physical injury or physical manifestation of an injury\"&#8212; one of the requirements for proving liability under the Convention.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Rather, Plaintiffs alleged only \"humiliation, embarrassment, and great anguish\"&#8212;none of which is compensable under the Convention. Since Plaintiffs were barred from recovering under the Convention, the court held that their claim under Puerto Rico law was likewise barred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Application of the Warsaw Convention</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Echoing the district court, Iberia notes that since \"[t]he Warsaw Convention's dispositions provide the exclusive source of an airline's liability in international flights claims,\" Acevedo-Reinoso's claim falls short because he does not allege any physical injury or an \"accident.\" Acevedo-Reinoso, on the other hand, argues that the court erroneously assumed the Convention's applicability without resolving the threshold issue of whether his injuries were \"sustained . . . on board the aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Convention art. 17. According to Acevedo-Reinoso, the Convention does not apply&#8212;and his Puerto Rico tort claim is therefore not preempted&#8212;because he was not embarking or disembarking when he sustained his injuries. Rather, Acevedo-Reinoso argues, his injuries were sustained \"in Spain in a detention jail and [in] ... being deported back to Puerto Rico in front of all the members of the Association.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with Acevedo-Reinoso that the district court erroneously conflated the applicability of the Convention with liability under the Convention. The Convention's applicability rests on a determination of whether the passenger's injury occurred \"on board the aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking.\" Convention art. 17. If the Convention applies in a particular case, it is preemptive, and the trier of fact must then determine whether the carrier is liable under the Convention. <i>See El Al Israel,</i> 525 U.S. at 161, 119 S.Ct. 662 (\"[R]ecovery for a personal injury on board [an] aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking, if not allowed under the Convention, is not available at all.\") (internal citation and quotation marks omitted); <i>see id.</i> at 174, 119 S.Ct. 662 (\"[I]n all questions relating to the carrier's liability, it is the provisions of the [C]onvention which apply and [] the passenger does not have access to any other remedies, whether under the common law or otherwise, which may be available within the particular country where he chooses to raise his action.\" (quoting <i>Sidhu v. British Airways plc,</i> [1997] 1 All E. R., 193 at 201, 207)). If the Convention is not applicable, it is not preemptive, and the passenger is free to pursue his or her claim under local law. <i>Id.</i> at 171-72, 119 S.Ct. 662 (\"[T]he Convention addresses and concerns, only and exclusively, the airline's liability for passenger injuries occurring `on board the aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking.'\" (quoting Convention art. 17)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court assumed the applicability of the Convention, stating that \"pursuant to <i>El Al Israel,</i> plaintiffs' only basis of redress is the Convention's passenger liability provision.\" But <i>El Al Israel</i> does not support such an assumption. In that case, applicability of the Convention was not at issue because the parties explicitly agreed that \"the episode-in-suit occurred in international transportation in the course of embarking.\" <i>El Al Israel,</i> 525 U.S. at 167, 119 S.Ct. 662. In this case, by contrast, the parties dispute whether Acevedo-Reinoso's damages were sustained \"in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking,\" and, thus, whether the Convention is applicable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Acevedo-Reinoso argues that Iberia's failure to advise him at the ticket counter of the need for a visa to enter Spain preceded his boarding the plane, and that his subsequent arrest upon arrival in Spain came well after he disembarked from the plane. Iberia, on the other hand, contends that its alleged failure to warn Acevedo-Reinoso at the airport in Puerto Rico and his ensuing arrest in Spain took place during the process of embarking and disembarking, respectively. Because the district court did not address this dispute, there was never any determination that the Convention was applicable and therefore preemptive of Acevedo-Reinoso's claim. <i>See Marotte,</i> 296 F.3d at 1260-61 (holding that the Convention preempted plaintiffs' state law claims where plaintiffs' injuries \"occurred in the process of embarking, as contemplated by the Warsaw Convention\"); <i>see also McCarthy,</i> 56 F.3d at 317 (holding that plaintiff was not engaged in the course of \"embarking\" under the Convention, based on \"(1) the passenger's activity at the time of injury, (2) his or her whereabouts when injured, and (3) the extent to which the carrier was exercising control at the moment of injury\"). The district court therefore erred in dismissing Acevedo-Reinoso's claim under the Convention without first determining whether Acevedo-Reinoso's injury occurred on board the airplane or in the process of embarking or disembarking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Liability Under Puerto Rico Law</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the Convention is not applicable and therefore not preemptive, Iberia asks us to affirm on a different basis, arguing that the motion to dismiss was properly granted because Acevedo-Reinoso does not state a claim under Puerto Rico law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Contract Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Iberia contends that while Acevedo-Reinoso characterizes his claim as sounding only in tort, his claim also sounds in contract, based on the allegation in the complaint that Iberia \"breached its contract to travel with Acevedo.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Iberia further argues that, as between these two sources of law, \"in Puerto Rico contractual law [] control[s] the scenario depicted in the complaint. As a result, Acevedo cannot resort to general principles of tort law but must submit [himself] to the provisions applicable to contracts.\" Furthermore, because \"the parties did not contract for Iberia to assume the duty of verifying that Acevedo's papers were in order for entering Spain, a task that was Acevedo's personal obligation to comply with,\" Iberia argues that Acevedo-Reinoso's claim fails to state a claim for breach of contract under Article 1054 of the Civil Code of Puerto Rico, P.R. Laws Ann., Tit. 31, &#167; 3018.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aside from language in the complaint briefly alluding to a contractual claim, Acevedo-Reinoso nowhere argues that Iberia breached a contract. On the contrary, Acevedo-Reinoso asserts that his claim \"is without a doubt one in tort,\" and states in the complaint that his state law claims are \"based on Article 1802 of the Civil Code of Puerto Rico\"&#8212;the Puerto Rico statute governing tort claims, P.R. Laws Ann., Tit. 31, &#167; 5141.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Nevertheless, even if we assume that Acevedo-Reinoso's claim sounds in both tort and contract, it does not follow that Puerto Rico contract law provides the remedy. In fact, the opposite is true: where the event that caused the damage results from the breach of both a contractual obligation as well as a noncontractual duty not to cause harm to another, Puerto Rico law holds that an action for damages for breach of contract does not lie. According to the Puerto Rico Supreme Court:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">an action for damages for breach of contract [Article 1054] only lies when the damage suffered <i>exclusively</i> arises as a consequence of the breach of an obligation specifically agreed upon, which damage would not occur without the existence of a contract. However ... a claim for noncontractual damages resulting from the breach of a contract lies if the act that caused the damage constitutes a breach of the general duty not to injure anyone and, at the same time, a breach of contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Ramos Lozada v. Orientalist Rattan Furniture, Inc.,</i> 130 P.R. Dec. 712, 727, 1992 P.R.-Eng. 755597, 1992 WL 755597 (P.R. 1992) (emphasis added). Iberia's argument regarding the application of Puerto Rico contract law is therefore unavailing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Tort Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Iberia argues that even if Puerto Rico tort law applies to Acevedo-Reinoso's claim, his claim should still be dismissed. By contrast, Acevedo-Reinoso argues that the complaint adequately states a claim for negligence. We agree with Acevedo-Reinoso. Puerto Rico tort law \"imposes responsibility for damages caused by negligence or fault. The necessary elements to prevail in [such a] tort action are: (1) a negligent act or omission, (2) damages, and (3) a causal relationship between them.\" <i>Irvine, IRG v. Murad Skin Research Labs., Inc.,</i> 194 F.3d 313, 321-22 (1st Cir.1999). The complaint alleges facts addressing each of these elements, stating that Iberia's negligent acts or omissions&#8212;i.e., its \"fail[ure] to advise [Acevedo-Reinoso] that he needed a visa in order to enter Spain\"&#8212;caused Acevedo-Reinoso to be \"detained by Spanish authorities in Spain, humiliated in front of his peers from the banking industry, and subjected to extensive mental anguish and sufferings.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Iberia's argument that an air carrier has no duty to advise passengers under Puerto Rico law is foreclosed by our decision in <i>Compagnie Nationale Air France v. Castano,</i> 358 F.2d 203 (1st Cir.1966). In that case, three passengers and a relative sued an air carrier under Puerto Rico tort law for failing to advise them that they needed visas to enter Spain. We opined that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the Puerto Rico court would ... hold [that] where there was evidence that the defendant, as an inducement to plaintiffs to purchase passage, had held itself out as a tourist or travel agency, and had negligently failed to provide the information that plaintiffs had reasonably been led to expect, [ ] damages for negligence would include ... proximate, though unforeseeable, injury of any sort.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 209. Applying this reasoning to the facts of that case, we held that \"the unforeseen suffering occasioned by defendant's failure to perform of the type here claimed can be compensated.\" <i>Id.</i> We noted, however, that \"there was a substantial factual issue whether this damage was proximate, and whether the plaintiff or plaintiffs reasonably attempted to mitigate the damages.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Acevedo-Reinoso claims that he was injured by the failure of an air carrier to advise him that he needed a visa to enter Spain. The facts alleged by Acevedo-Reinoso in this case are nearly identical to those alleged by the passengers in <i>Castano,</i> and thus are sufficient to state a claim for the negligent failure to advise under Puerto Rico tort law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, we hold that the district court erred in granting Iberia's motion to dismiss based on the preemptive effect of the Convention, without first determining whether the Convention in fact applied to this case. On remand, the district court must determine whether Acevedo-Reinoso's injury occurred \"in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking.\" If the district court answers this question in the affirmative, the Convention will apply and will preempt Acevedo-Reinoso's Puerto Rico tort claim, thus limiting his claim to one that meets the requirements of the Convention. If, on the other hand, the district court answers this question in the negative, the Convention will have no application and this case will go forward on the elements of the tort claim set forth under Puerto Rico tort law. We <i>vacate</i> the district court's judgment granting Iberia's motion to dismiss and <i>remand</i> for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

Michel Acevedo-Reinoso is a citizen of Cuba with legal residence in the United States. At the time of this action, Acevedo-Reinoso resided in Puerto Rico. In October 2002, Acevedo-Reinoso, a banking executive, was invited to participate in an annual convention hosted by the Mortgage Loan Officers Association (\"Association\") in Madrid, Spain. The Association contracted with a travel agency, The Travel Place, to coordinate all travel arrangements for attendees to the convention. The Travel Place assured Acevedo-Reinoso that he would not require a visa, and instead need only show his Cuban passport and U.S. resident alien card upon entry to Spain. On November 13, 2002, Acevedo-Reinoso and his partner, Maria Pacheco-Gonzalez, a U.S. citizen (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\"), arrived at the Iberia L&#237;neas A&#233;reas Espa&#241;olas, S.A. (\"Iberia\") airline counter in Puerto Rico to check in. The Iberia agent informed Acevedo-Reinoso and Pacheco-Gonzalez that all immigration documents were in place and gave them their tickets and boarding passes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon arriving in Spain on November 14, 2002, a Spanish immigration officer requested passports from all passengers. When Acevedo-Reinoso showed his Cuban passport, the Spanish government ordered his immediate detention. Acevedo-Reinoso was questioned, represented by counsel appointed by the Spanish government, and detained with other allegedly illegal immigrants in a closed room in the airport. Meanwhile, Pacheco-Gonzalez suffered great anguish at seeing her partner detained in front of his peers in the banking industry, mocked by Spanish immigration officers, and humiliated. Acevedo-Reinoso's appointed counsel provided him with several documents for his review. At the behest of a Spanish officer who told him the documents were for his own benefit, Acevedo-Reinoso signed the documents without reading them, and was subsequently told that he would be deported to his country of origin&#8212;Cuba. Acevedo-Reinoso suffered great anguish thinking about the punishment he would face at the hands of Cuban authorities upon returning to a country he was forced to leave many years ago, and the suffering&#8212;financial and otherwise&#8212;of his partner and two children who would be forced to live without him in Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that evening, Acevedo-Reinoso was taken to another room where he was strip-searched and humiliated by a female Spanish officer. He was then taken to a detention room with hundreds of allegedly illegal immigrants, where he was served his first meal of the day and was ordered to pass the night in a cold room that included a row of bunk beds without sheets or blankets. During this time, Acevedo-Reinoso observed Spanish officers beating a young adolescent from Ecuador who stood up to visit the restroom. The following morning, after speaking with Pacheco-Gonzalez about a letter she had obtained from the General Manager of the hotel in Spain assuming responsibility for him during his stay, Acevedo-Reinoso inquired whether he could be sent back to Puerto Rico. Spanish officers declined to accept this proposition. Pacheco-Gonzalez was extremely nervous about her partner's future and the well-being of herself and her children. The following day, Acevedo-Reinoso was escorted by several Spanish guards to an Iberia airplane bound for San Juan, Puerto Rico, detained until airline crew boarded the airplane, and thereafter released.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of the humiliation, emotional distress, and mental anguish they experienced, Plaintiffs sued Iberia, a foreign entity, in federal court, alleging negligence under Puerto Rico law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> On February 25, 2003, Iberia brought a motion to dismiss for failure to join as indispensable parties The Travel Company and its owner. That motion was denied. Iberia then filed its answer to Plaintiffs' complaint. After discovery and the entry of a pretrial order, Iberia filed a second motion to dismiss, based on Plaintiffs' failure to state a claim under the Convention, and, in the alternative, under Puerto Rico law. The district court dismissed Plaintiffs' action for failure to state a claim under the Convention.

According to Acevedo-Reinoso, the Convention does not apply&#8212;and his Puerto Rico tort claim is therefore not preempted&#8212;because he was not embarking or disembarking when he sustained his injuries.

In that case, applicability of the Convention was not at issue because the parties explicitly agreed that \"the episode-in-suit occurred in international transportation in the course of embarking.\" <i>El Al Israel,</i> 525 U.S. at 167, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118253\"><a href=\"/opinion/118253/el-al-israel-airlines-ltd-v-tsui-yuan-tseng/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In this case, by contrast, the parties dispute whether Acevedo-Reinoso's damages were sustained \"in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking,\" and, thus, whether the Convention is applicable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Acevedo-Reinoso argues that Iberia's failure to advise him at the ticket counter of the need for a visa to enter Spain preceded his boarding the plane, and that his subsequent arrest upon arrival in Spain came well after he disembarked from the plane. Iberia, on the other hand, contends that its alleged failure to warn Acevedo-Reinoso at the airport in Puerto Rico and his ensuing arrest in Spain took place during the process of embarking and disembarking, respectively. Because the district court did not address this dispute, there was never any determination that the Convention was applicable and therefore preemptive of Acevedo-Reinoso's claim. <i>See Marotte,</i> 296 F.3d at 1260-61 (holding that the Convention preempted plaintiffs' state law claims where plaintiffs' injuries \"occurred in the process of embarking, as contemplated by the Warsaw Convention\"); <i>see also McCarthy,</i> 56 F.3d at 317 (holding that plaintiff was not engaged in the course of \"embarking\" under the Convention, based on \"(1) the passenger's activity at the time of injury, (2) his or her whereabouts when injured, and (3) the extent to which the carrier was exercising control at the moment of injury\"). The district court therefore erred in dismissing Acevedo-Reinoso's claim under the Convention without first determining whether Acevedo-Reinoso's injury occurred on board the airplane or in the process of embarking or disembarking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.

Contract Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Iberia contends that while Acevedo-Reinoso characterizes his claim as sounding only in tort, his claim also sounds in contract, based on the allegation in the complaint that Iberia \"breached its contract to travel with Acevedo.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Iberia further argues that, as between these two sources of law, \"in Puerto Rico contractual law [] control[s] the scenario depicted in the complaint. As a result, Acevedo cannot resort to general principles of tort law but must submit [himself] to the provisions applicable to contracts.\" Furthermore, because \"the parties did not contract for Iberia to assume the duty of verifying that Acevedo's papers were in order for entering Spain, a task that was Acevedo's personal obligation to comply with,\" Iberia argues that Acevedo-Reinoso's claim fails to state a claim for breach of contract under Article 1054 of the Civil Code of Puerto Rico, P.R. Laws Ann., Tit. 31, &#167; 3018.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aside from language in the complaint briefly alluding to a contractual claim, Acevedo-Reinoso nowhere argues that Iberia breached a contract. On the contrary, Acevedo-Reinoso asserts that his claim \"is without a doubt one in tort,\" and states in the complaint that his state law claims are \"based on Article 1802 of the Civil Code of Puerto Rico\"&#8212;the Puerto Rico statute governing tort claims, P.R. Laws Ann., Tit. 31, &#167; 5141.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Nevertheless, even if we assume that Acevedo-Reinoso's claim sounds in both tort and contract, it does not follow that Puerto Rico contract law provides the remedy. In fact, the opposite is true: where the event that caused the damage results from the breach of both a contractual obligation as well as a noncontractual duty not to cause harm to another, Puerto Rico law holds that an action for damages for breach of contract does not lie. According to the Puerto Rico Supreme Court:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">an action for damages for breach of contract [Article 1054] only lies when the damage suffered <i>exclusively</i> arises as a consequence of the breach of an obligation specifically agreed upon, which damage would not occur without the existence of a contract. However ... a claim for noncontractual damages resulting from the breach of a contract lies if the act that caused the damage constitutes a breach of the general duty not to injure anyone and, at the same time, a breach of contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Ramos Lozada v.

Tort Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Iberia argues that even if Puerto Rico tort law applies to Acevedo-Reinoso's claim, his claim should still be dismissed. By contrast, Acevedo-Reinoso argues that the complaint adequately states a claim for negligence. We agree with Acevedo-Reinoso. Puerto Rico tort law \"imposes responsibility for damages caused by negligence or fault. The necessary elements to prevail in [such a] tort action are: (1) a negligent act or omission, (2) damages, and (3) a causal relationship between them.\" <i>Irvine, IRG v.

The complaint alleges facts addressing each of these elements, stating that Iberia's negligent acts or omissions&#8212;i.e., its \"fail[ure] to advise [Acevedo-Reinoso] that he needed a visa in order to enter Spain\"&#8212;caused Acevedo-Reinoso to be \"detained by Spanish authorities in Spain, humiliated in front of his peers from the banking industry, and subjected to extensive mental anguish and sufferings.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Iberia's argument that an air carrier has no duty to advise passengers under Puerto Rico law is foreclosed by our decision in <i>Compagnie Nationale Air France v.

The facts alleged by Acevedo-Reinoso in this case are nearly identical to those alleged by the passengers in <i>Castano,</i> and thus are sufficient to state a claim for the negligent failure to advise under Puerto Rico tort law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, we hold that the district court erred in granting Iberia's motion to dismiss based on the preemptive effect of the Convention, without first determining whether the Convention in fact applied to this case. On remand, the district court must determine whether Acevedo-Reinoso's injury occurred \"in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking.\" If the district court answers this question in the affirmative, the Convention will apply and will preempt Acevedo-Reinoso's Puerto Rico tort claim, thus limiting his claim to one that meets the requirements of the Convention. If, on the other hand, the district court answers this question in the negative, the Convention will have no application and this case will go forward on the elements of the tort claim set forth under Puerto Rico tort law.

We are unpersuaded by this argument but see no need to discuss it in any detail since we decide this appeal in Acevedo-Reinoso's favor on the merits</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> According to Iberia, \"[t]he well-pleaded allegations [ ]form a basic contract: Acevedo would pay a specific monetary amount to Iberia, in exchange for safe transportation to Madrid, Spain.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Article 1054 states, in relevant part, that</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">those who in any manner whatsoever act in contravention of the stipulations of [their contractual obligations], shall be subject to indemnify for the losses and damages caused thereby.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">P.R.

While <i>Castano</i> did not discuss the applicability of the Convention, our determination that Acevedo-Reinoso states a claim under Puerto Rico tort law does not depend on the applicability of the Convention. In fact, Acevedo-Reinoso's tort claim has effect only to the extent that the Convention does <i>not</i> apply (and does not preempt the tort claim). In addition, while we vacated three of the verdicts in <i>Castano</i> (and dismissed the fourth) and remanded for a new trial, the lack of a final disposition in that case does not render our holding under Puerto Rico law any less binding. <i>See Room v. Caribe Hilton Hotel,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"393993\"><a href=\"/opinion/393993/herbert-room-v-caribe-hilton-hotel/\"><span class=\"volume\">659</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 8 n. 3 (1st Cir.1981) (relying on <i>Castano</i> for proposition that \"[u]nder Puerto Rico law a plaintiff may recover damages for mental suffering\"). Finally, while it may be that \"Iberia was in no position to induce Acevedo to purchase passage\" and did not hold itself out \"as a tourist or travel agency,\" these issues await further factual development at summary judgment or trial. At this stage in the proceedings, for the reasons discussed above, Acevedo-Reinoso has alleged sufficient facts to overcome Iberia's motion to dismiss.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
