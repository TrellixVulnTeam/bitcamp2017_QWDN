In the petition, Fontes raises two issues. As to the\nissue of whether Fontes was entitled to a section 212(c) waiver of\ndeportability, the petition for panel rehearing is summarily\ndenied.\n\n     Fontes also raises a challenge to the panel's holding that,\nunder the Real ID Act, this court lacks jurisdiction to review the\nBIA's rejection of his res judicata argument. The ACLU has moved\nfor leave to file an amicus brief on the latter issue. We have\nallowed the motion to file the amicus brief.\n\n     As framed by those filings, the late-blooming issue involves\na question of whether the Suspension Clause is violated by reading\nthe statute to deny Fontes review in this instance (in which his\nhabeas action was affected by the REAL ID Act). We note, in this\nregard, that Fontes does not argue the Suspension Clause issue as\na per se ground for relief but, rather, proposes that we allow a\ngrace period for assertion of his claim.     Cf. Rogers v. United\nStates, 180 F.3d 349, 354 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\f     In the briefs filed by Fontes before the panel, Fontes never\narticulated a claim that application of the Real ID Act to bar\njurisdiction here might violate the Suspension Clause of the\nConstitution. U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 2. In the usual course,\nwe will not address an issue raised by a party for the first time\nin a petition for rehearing. See Anderson v. Beatrice Foods Co.,\n900 F.2d 388, 397 (1st Cir. 1990)(order on rehearing). By the same\ntoken, we will not address an issue raised by an amicus that was\nnot seasonably raised by a party to the case. See Lane v. First\nNat'l Bank of Boston, 871 F.2d 166, 175 (1st Cir. 1989).        We\ndiscern no reason here to depart from our customary practice in\neither of these respects.\n\n     Still, we acknowledge that the Suspension Clause issue is not\nonly of constitutional dimension but also is colorable.\nConsequently, we wish to make clear that our holding on the\njurisdictional issue should not be read, under principles of stare\ndecisis, as barring a future panel of this court, in a case in\nwhich the Suspension Clause issue is timely raised, directly\npresented, and fully briefed, from considering the import (if any)\nof the Suspension Clause with respect to the jurisdictional\nquestion. This panel intimates no view as to the outcome of such\nan inquiry.\n\n     This course of action seems especially appropriate in this\ncase because, even if we had jurisdiction to review the BIA's\nrejection of Fontes's res judicata claim, we would deny that claim\non the merits. As noted in our earlier opinion, Fontes argued that\nres judicata barred the government from asserting that he had\ncommitted an aggravated felony.      The BIA explained that it\ngenerally applies the doctrine of res judicata, but found that\ndoctrine inapplicable here because the statutory definition of\naggravated felony extant at the time of Fontes's prior removal\nproceedings was different and far narrower. Fontes's offense did\nnot meet the then-pertinent definition.\n\n     In the BIA's view, that did not preclude further removal\nproceedings because, in its 1996 enactment of IIRIRA, Congress both\nbroadened the definition of aggravated felony and applied it\nretroactively. See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(43)(F), 1227(a)(2)(iii).\nBecause a different and broader definition now controlled and that\ndefinition applied retroactively, the two proceedings did not\ninvolve the same claim or cause of action.      Thus, an essential\nelement of res judicata was missing from the equation. For that\nreason, the BIA declined to terminate the current removal\nproceeding.\n\n     We think that the BIA correctly refused to terminate Fontes's\nremoval proceedings in light of the clear congressional intent that\nits broadened definition of aggravated felony be applied\n\fretroactively. The government still had to prove that Fontes's\nconviction met the new definition of aggravated felony. It was\nneither an error of law nor an abuse of discretion for the BIA, to\nwhom some deference on interpretation of immigration statutes is\nowed, not to accept Fontes's claim that res judicata barred any\nfurther proceedings by the government.\n\n     We note a further difficulty with Fontes's argument. Given\nCongress's decision to make the broader definition apply\nretroactively, it is at least arguable that the decision in the\nprior removal proceeding was not \"final\" for res judicata purposes.\nThere is no claim that Congress was forbidden to apply its expanded\ndefinition retroactively by the Ex Post Facto Clause, U.S. Const.\nart. I, § 9, cl. 3. and an exception to res judicata traditionally\nexists \"where between the time of the first judgment and the second\n. . . there has been an intervening . . . change in the law\ncreating an altered situation.\" State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v.\nDuel, 354 U.S. 154, 162 (1945).\n\n     Accordingly, we deny Fontes's petition for panel rehearing\n(the petition for rehearing en banc will be disposed of by separate\norder).\n\n     So Ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                    By the Court:\n                                    Richard Cushing Donovan, Clerk\n\n\n                                    _______________________________\n                                    By: Margaret Carter,\n                                    Chief Deputy Clerk\n\n\n\n\n[Certified copies to Board of Immigration appeals.
