The petitioner, Chamel Makhoul\n\nMakhoul, a native and citizen of Lebanon, seeks review of a final\n\norder of    the    Board    of   Immigration      Appeals    (BIA)      denying    his\n\napplication for asylum, withholding of deportation, and protection\n\nunder    Article   III     of    the    Convention      Against    Torture   (CAT).\n\nConcluding,   as    we     do,   that    the    BIA's   order     is   supported    by\n\nsubstantial evidence, we affirm.\n\n                                          I.\n\n                                   Background\n\n            The petitioner, now twenty-two years of age, arrived at\n\nMiami International Airport on March 15, 2001.                    He had no visa.\n\nInstead, he presented his Lebanese passport at the immigration\n\ncounter and requested asylum.                  Agents of the Immigration and\n\nNaturalization Service (INS) took him to a detention facility.1                     In\n\na March 23 interview with an asylum officer, the petitioner claimed\n\nthat Syrian soldiers had thrice arrested him during demonstrations\n\nagainst the Syrian occupation of Lebanon. He also claimed that the\n\nsecret police had arrested and beaten him in February of 2001 for\n\ndistributing anti-Syrian pamphlets.\n\n            Based on this account, the asylum officer tentatively\n\ndetermined that the petitioner had a credible fear of persecution\n\n\n     1\n      The Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. 107-296, § 471,\n116 Stat. 2135, 2205 (codified as amended at 6 U.S.C. § 291(a)),\nabolished the INS and transferred its duties to the Department of\nHomeland Security. See Lattab v. Ashcroft, 384 F.3d 8, 13 n.2 (1st\nCir. 2004). For simplicity's sake, we refer throughout to the INS.\n\n                                         -2-\n\fon account of his political opinion.            The INS duly initiated\n\nremoval proceedings and served him with a notice to appear in the\n\nImmigration Court.     Pending the resolution of the petitioner's\n\nstatus, the INS paroled him into the United States.          See 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 212.5(c) (2004).     Once on parole, the petitioner traveled to\n\nBoston to live with family members.      Appearing telephonically at a\n\nhearing before the Immigration Court, sitting in Florida, the\n\npetitioner conceded deportability but sought asylum, withholding of\n\ndeportation, and relief under CAT.           The Immigration Court then\n\ngranted   the   petitioner's     unopposed    motion   to   transfer   the\n\nproceedings to Boston.    See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.20.\n\n          Shortly thereafter, the petitioner recanted the story he\n\nhad told at his asylum interview.        In a declaration accompanying\n\nhis asylum application, he stated only that he had posted anti-\n\nSyrian political statements on an Internet chat site and had\n\ndownloaded provocative political material.        At a hearing before an\n\nimmigration judge (IJ) on December 5, 2002, the petitioner admitted\n\nthat he had concocted the original tale about arrests and beatings.\n\nHe attributed the fabrication to the advice of a self-styled\n\nimmigration consultant.\n\n          Having     abandoned    his    fictitious    claim     of    past\n\npersecution, the petitioner suggested that he had a well-founded\n\nfear of future persecution on account of his political opinion.\n\nThis suggestion traveled along a circuitous path.           The petitioner\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\ftestified that he had opposed the Syrian occupation of Lebanon for\n\nsome time and had expressed his opposition in Internet chat rooms.\n\nIn addition, the petitioner's friend, Elias El Gobaly, had asked\n\nhim to download a brochure calling for the ouster of Syrian forces\n\nfrom Lebanon and featuring a picture of Michel Aoun (the exiled\n\nformer president of Lebanon and the inspirational figurehead for\n\nthis virtual protest movement).        The petitioner complied, giving\n\nmultiple copies of the flier to Gobaly, who then distributed them.\n\n           The Syrians arrested Gobaly in December of 2000.          The\n\npetitioner assumed that the Syrians would torture Gobaly and would\n\nforce him to reveal the petitioner's role in the production of the\n\nbrochures.    Fearful of these imagined consequences, the petitioner\n\nfled the country.\n\n           The record is silent both as to what treatment Gobaly\n\nreceived and as to what information (if any) Gobaly might have\n\nprovided to his captors.       According to one of the petitioner's\n\nbrothers (who still resides in Lebanon), the Syrians eventually\n\nreleased Gobaly.      The petitioner admitted that he did not know\n\nwhether Gobaly had named names or under what conditions Gobaly had\n\nbeen   detained.     Despite   these    uncertainties,   the   petitioner\n\nexpressed fear that the authorities would arrest and torture him if\n\nhe dared to return to Lebanon.\n\n             The IJ found little probative value in this reconstructed\n\nnarrative.     Nor did the petitioner's presentation of documentary\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fevidence   detailing    abusive   conduct   by    Syrian   forces   toward\n\noutspoken supporters of the former president fill this void; the IJ\n\nconcluded that the petitioner had not brought himself within this\n\nsphere. After all, the petitioner himself had never been arrested,\n\ndetained, or brutalized.    Thus, his belief that the Syrians sought\n\nhis capture rested entirely upon Gobaly's arrest.             But, the IJ\n\nnoted, the petitioner had proffered no evidence illuminating the\n\ncircumstances surrounding Gobaly's detention, nor had he adduced\n\nany proof about what Gobaly might (or might not) have revealed to\n\nthe authorities. Accordingly, the notion that the Syrians would be\n\non the lookout for the petitioner was, in the IJ's words, \"highly\n\nspeculative.\"\n\n           Although the IJ did not make an explicit credibility\n\nfinding, her skepticism was evident.        She reasoned that something\n\nmore mundane than fear of persecution likely drove the petitioner's\n\ndesire to emigrate to the United States.         The petitioner's father\n\nhad been in Boston since 1993 and was seeking to become a lawful\n\npermanent resident.     See 8 U.S.C. § 1255; 8 C.F.R. § 204.5.        The\n\npetitioner indicated that he had hoped to qualify for permanent\n\nresidency as his father's dependent and admitted that he had\n\nemptied out his father's store in Lebanon before leaving the\n\ncountry.    The   IJ   believed   that   these   admissions   supported   a\n\nplausible inference that the family had made a collective decision\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fto relocate to the United States and that the petitioner's real\n\nintention was to join them.\n\n            Based on these findings, the IJ held that the petitioner\n\nhad not established a well-founded fear of future persecution. She\n\nthus    denied   the   petitioner's        applications    for   asylum   and\n\nwithholding of deportation. Noting that the Syrian authorities had\n\nnever laid a finger on the petitioner, the IJ also ruled that the\n\npetitioner had wholly failed to show that he would face likely\n\ntorture if removed to Lebanon.        Consequently, the IJ rejected the\n\npetitioner's CAT claim as well and ordered him removed to Lebanon.\n\n            The petitioner appealed.        The BIA summarily affirmed the\n\nIJ's decision on February 6, 2004.            This petition for judicial\n\nreview followed.\n\n                                     II.\n\n                               Discussion\n\n            In order to become eligible for asylum, an alien must\n\nestablish that he is a refugee.             See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1); 8\n\nC.F.R. § 208.13(a); see also Laurent v. Ashcroft, 359 F.3d 59, 63\n\n(1st Cir. 2004).       A refugee is a person unable or unwilling to\n\nreturn to his home country \"because of persecution or a well-\n\nfounded   fear   of    persecution    on    account   of   race,   religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\nopinion.\"   8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A); see Laurent, 359 F.3d at 63-\n\n64.    A showing of past persecution creates a presumption that an\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fapplicant's fear of future persecution is well-founded.                     See 8\n\nC.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1); see also Fergiste v. INS, 138 F.3d 14, 18\n\n(1st Cir. 1998).         In the absence of a showing of past persecution,\n\nthe asylum applicant bears the burden of demonstrating that his\n\nfear of future persecution is well-founded.                 See Laurent, 359 F.3d\n\nat 65.\n\n               When an IJ rejects an alien's application for asylum and\n\norders his removal, the BIA has jurisdiction to review the order\n\nupon the filing of a timely appeal.                  See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(b),\n\n1240.15; see also Nugent v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 162, 165 (3d Cir.\n\n2004).     \"Where, as here, the BIA conducts a de novo review of the\n\nrecord, independently validates the sufficiency of the evidence,\n\nand adopts the IJ's findings and conclusions, the IJ's findings\n\nbecome the BIA's.\"         Laurent, 359 F.3d at 64 n.3.              We review the\n\nBIA's order pursuant to the authority conferred by 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1252(b).\n\n               Our review is deferential.            In immigration cases, the\n\ncourt    of    appeals    applies   the    familiar     \"substantial     evidence\"\n\nstandard of review.         It must uphold the BIA's decision \"unless any\n\nreasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the\n\ncontrary.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B). Put another way, a reviewing\n\ncourt    can    reverse    the   BIA   only     if    the   record   unequivocally\n\nindicates error.         INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481 & n.1\n\n(1992).       Indeed, if an asylum applicant's fact-based challenge to\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fan unfavorable decision is to succeed, \"the administrative record,\n\nviewed in its entirety, must compel the conclusion that he is\n\nasylum-eligible.\"    Aguilar-Solis v. INS, 168 F.3d 565, 569 (1st\n\nCir. 1999) (emphasis omitted).\n\n            Against this backdrop, we turn to the specifics of the\n\npetitioner's claims.   For the first time on appeal, the petitioner\n\ncontends that he has suffered past persecution.2          This argument\n\nstarts with the premise that the Syrian occupiers exercise brutal\n\ncontrol over the Lebanese people.       That premise is supported by\n\ndocumentary evidence in the record and we accept it.        Building on\n\nthis uncontroversial    foundation,    the   petitioner   suggests   that\n\nGobaly's arrest placed him (the petitioner) in a state of intense\n\nanxiety, exacerbated by a fear that his own arrest and abuse were\n\nimminent.    From this, the petitioner argues that he experienced\n\npsychological torment, which amounted to \"persecution\" in the\n\nstatutory sense.\n\n            As a theoretical matter, we acknowledge that, under the\n\nright set of circumstances, a finding of past persecution might\n\nrest on a showing of psychological harm.       See, e.g., Miljkovic v.\n\nAshcroft, 376 F.3d 754, 756 (7th Cir. 2004); Knezevic v. Ashcroft,\n\n367 F.3d 1206, 1211-12 (9th Cir. 2004); Ouda v. INS, 324 F.3d 445,\n\n453-55 (6th Cir. 2003); see also Boykov v. INS, 109 F.3d 413, 416\n\n\n     2\n      The petitioner did, of course, raise a different claim of\npast persecution in his initial asylum interview.      That claim,\nhowever, was premised on falsehoods, and he has since abandoned it.\n\n                                 -8-\n\f(7th Cir. 1997) (expressing willingness, in rare cases, to regard\n\nmere threats as persecution).    Here, however, the issue of past\n\npersecution is not fairly before us.      The controlling statute, 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1252(d)(1), provides that review of a final removal order\n\nis only permissible if \"the alien has exhausted all administrative\n\nremedies available to the alien as of right.\"    We have interpreted\n\nthis statute to mean that theories not advanced before the BIA may\n\nnot be surfaced for the first time in a petition for judicial\n\nreview of the BIA's final order.      See Ravindran v. INS, 976 F.2d\n\n754, 761 (1st Cir. 1992); Alvarez-Flores v. INS, 909 F.2d 1, 8 (1st\n\nCir. 1990).   This same principle of preclusion extends to claims\n\nnot raised before the IJ.   See Debab v. INS, 163 F.3d 21, 26 (1st\n\nCir. 1998).\n\n          This template is dispositive of the petitioner's belated\n\nclaim of past persecution.      The petitioner did not raise this\n\ncontention either in the declaration that accompanied his asylum\n\napplication or in his testimony before the IJ.       Nor did he, in\n\neither of those fora, assert a claim of psychological persecution.\n\nGiven these procedural defaults, we decline to entertain his virgin\n\nclaim of past persecution in this venue.\n\n          This leaves the petitioner's claim that he harbors a\n\nwell-founded fear of future persecution.3     Such a claim has both\n\n\n     3\n      An asylum applicant who can establish that he has suffered\npast persecution is presumed to be a refugee for purposes of\neligibility. This presumption shifts the burden to the government\n\n                                -9-\n\fsubjective        and   objective      components.           To    establish       asylum\n\neligibility on this ground, an applicant must demonstrate both that\n\nhe genuinely fears persecution if he is deported to his homeland\n\nand that his fear is objectively reasonable.                   Laurent, 359 F.3d at\n\n65.    An applicant typically will show genuineness through his own\n\ncredible testimony.        See, e.g., Balogun v. Ashcroft, 374 F.3d 492,\n\n499 (7th Cir. 2004).        The more difficult burden is to show that his\n\nfear   is    objectively     reasonable.           To    carry     this   burden,     the\n\napplicant need not prove that he will more likely than not suffer\n\nfuture persecution.        See INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 450\n\n(1987).     Rather, his proof suffices if it shows that \"a reasonable\n\nperson      in    the   asylum    applicant's           circumstances     would      fear\n\npersecution        on   account   of     a    statutorily         protected    ground.\"\n\nAguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d at 572.\n\n             In this instance, the petitioner makes two arguments to\n\nsupport     his    insistence     that       he   has    a   well-founded      fear    of\n\npersecution if deported.          We deal with these arguments separately.\n\n             The    petitioner's       first       argument       is   that   he    fears\n\npersecution on account of his membership in a particular social\n\ngroup.    This argument is hopeless.              For one thing, he has failed to\n\n\nto show that conditions in the applicant's home country have\nchanged to such an extent that he has no well-founded fear of\nfuture persecution. 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1); see Fergiste, 138\nF.3d at 18.    Because the petitioner has not established past\npersecution, he must carry the devoir of persuasion on the issue of\nwhether he has a well-founded fear of future persecution.       See\nU.S.C. § 1158(b)(1); 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(a).\n\n                                         -10-\n\fidentify the particular social group with which he claims to be\n\naffiliated.   For another thing, throughout the proceedings below\n\nthe petitioner sought asylum solely on the basis that he would be\n\npersecuted for his political opinion.     Because he neglected to\n\nraise the \"social group\" issue before the IJ, that issue is\n\nprocedurally defaulted.   See Debab, 163 F.3d at 26.\n\n          The petitioner's second argument — that he fears future\n\npersecution on the basis of political opinion — forms the crux of\n\nhis asylum application. To satisfy the subjective component of the\n\nwell-founded fear standard, the petitioner testified as to the\n\ngenuineness of his concern.   The IJ, without explicitly impugning\n\nthe petitioner's credibility, suggested obliquely that his efforts\n\nto benefit derivatively from his father's quest to become a lawful\n\npermanent resident and the fact that he had spent his final months\n\nin Lebanon cleaning out the family store may have had more to do\n\nwith his flight to the United States than his fear of future events\n\nin Lebanon.\n\n          The petitioner argues that, in the absence of an adverse\n\ncredibility finding, these facts are irrelevant to a resolution of\n\nwhether his fear of persecution is genuine.   We do not agree.   What\n\nis in a person's mind cannot be measured with scientific precision,\n\nand if the evidence fairly suggests that a reason other than a fear\n\nof persecution provides the primary impetus for an alien's desire\n\nto seek asylum, that certainly bears on the genuineness of his\n\n\n                               -11-\n\fsubjective claim.   See, e.g., Lin v. Ashcroft, 371 F.3d 18, 22 (1st\n\nCir. 2004); Disu v. Ashcroft, 338 F.3d 13, 16 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n            In all events, the record is less than pellucid on this\n\npoint.   It is hard to tell whether the IJ's decision implicitly\n\nincorporates a finding that the petitioner's fear was less than\n\ngenuine. Because that question is open to interpretation, we leave\n\nit unresolved.      In this case, the petitioner's fear, even if\n\nsubjectively genuine, is not well-founded.\n\n            The asserted fear of future persecution on account of\n\npolitical opinion stems from Gobaly's arrest and the possibility\n\nthat Gobaly may have identified the petitioner as a dissident\n\nand/or   participant    in    seditious    activities.     The     petitioner\n\nbuttresses the claim with documentary evidence of widespread human\n\nrights abuses in Lebanon.        From these loosely related pieces of\n\nevidence, he invited the IJ to construct a chain of inferences\n\nsuggesting the possibility that he would be persecuted if deported.\n\nThe IJ declined the invitation.\n\n            We discern no hint of error.        The chain of inferences\n\nfashioned by the petitioner is woven from gossamer strands of\n\nspeculation and surmise.        The petitioner himself has never been\n\narrested,   detained,    or    otherwise    harmed.      Indeed,    there   is\n\nabsolutely no evidence that he has even attracted the attention of\n\nthe Syrian occupiers.        As far as anyone can tell, both he and his\n\nactivities in cyberspace have gone unnoticed.             This is not the\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fstuff of which objectively reasonable fears of future persecution\n\nare constructed.      See Pieterson v. Ashcroft, 364 F.3d 38, 45 (1st\n\nCir. 2004) (stating that lack of past arrest or detention made\n\nalien's     chance   of   being   individually   targeted    less   likely);\n\nRavindran, 976 F.2d at 759 (declining to credit alien's professed\n\nfear of being singled out for persecution in the absence of any\n\nevidence that authorities knew about his political activities).\n\nHere, moreover, the claim of possible future persecution is made\n\neven more tenuous by the total lack of any evidence that Gobaly\n\nhimself was mistreated or even interrogated during his detention.\n\nFrom aught that appears, Gobaly never spoke to the authorities at\n\nany time about the assistance that the petitioner had privately\n\nrendered — or, at least, there is no proof that he did.\n\n             Another circumstance militates in favor of the IJ's\n\nruling.     The petitioner's level of political activism does not\n\nsuggest that of a leader or even a follower.         His political speech\n\nwas limited to Internet chat rooms (fora that arguably provide a\n\ncertain expectation of anonymity), and he engaged in just one\n\nsolitary act of opposition by printing seditious leaflets.              That\n\nact was carried out in the privacy of his own home.           As the basis\n\nfor an asylum application, this diminutive political profile tends\n\nto   make   the    petitioner's    asserted   fear   of   persecution   less\n\nreasonable.       See Pieterson, 364 F.3d at 44-45.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\f            To   be   sure,   the    supporting   documentation       paints    a\n\ntroubling portrait of the situation in Lebanon.                    Human rights\n\nobviously are not a high priority there.              Still, over and above\n\nrandom atrocities, the most that this generic evidence shows is\n\nthat Syrian forces have targeted political dissidents who have come\n\nto their attention.       Absent a connection with the petitioner — an\n\nindividual who has never publicly been involved in political\n\nprotest and who, insofar as the record reflects, has never come up\n\non the Syrians' radar screen — this evidence does not go very far\n\ntoward   showing      objective     reasonableness    of     the   petitioner's\n\nprofessed fear.       See Morales v. INS, 208 F.3d 323, 331 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).   Weighing this evidence in light of the record as a whole,\n\nwe cannot say that the IJ was compelled to reach a conclusion\n\nfavorable to the petitioner on the question of whether the latter's\n\nprofessed fear of future persecution on account of his political\n\nopinion was well-founded.         See Aguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d at 572.\n\n            That effectively ends the matter.           Because substantial\n\nevidence supports the denial of asylum, we need not address the\n\npetitioner's other claims.          We explain briefly.\n\n            A claim for withholding of deportation demands that the\n\nalien carry a more stringent burden of proof than does an asylum\n\nclaim.   See 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A).            Thus, if an alien cannot\n\nestablish    asylum    eligibility,     his   claim    for    withholding      of\n\n\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fdeportation fails a fortiori.    See Ipina v. INS, 868 F.2d 511, 515\n\n(1st Cir. 1989).\n\n          The petitioner's skeletal claim for relief under CAT\n\nfares no better.   What we have written to this point demonstrates\n\nthat the CAT claim is beyond redemption.         At any rate, the\n\npetitioner has wholly failed to develop any argumentation on that\n\nclaim before us.      Consequently, we deem that portion of his\n\npetition waived.   See Aguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d at 574; Athehortua-\n\nVanegas v. INS, 876 F.2d 238, 241 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n                                 III.\n\n                              Conclusion\n\n          We need go no further.     Amid a sea of global violence,\n\nCongress dug a narrow channel of relief for those who face possible\n\nfuture persecution.   The statutory requirement that an applicant\n\nfor asylum show a well-founded fear of persecution demands more\n\nthan this petitioner has mustered. Since the IJ's decision and the\n\nBIA's order rest on a plausible rendition of the record, the\n\npetition for review must be denied and dismissed.\n\n\n\n          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\f",

Wendtland, Assistant Director, Office of Immigration Litigation, and Norah Ascoli Schwarz, Senior Litigation Counsel, Office of Immigration Litigation, on brief for respondent.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before SELYA, Circuit Judge, COFFIN and CYR, Senior Circuit Judges.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SELYA, Circuit Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner, Chamel Makhoul Makhoul, a native and citizen of Lebanon, seeks review of a final order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) denying his application for asylum, withholding of deportation, and protection under Article III of the Convention Against Torture (CAT). Concluding, as we do, that the BIA's order is supported by substantial evidence, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>I.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner, now twenty-two years of age, arrived at Miami International Airport on March 15, 2001. He had no visa. Instead, he presented his Lebanese passport at the immigration counter and requested asylum. Agents of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) took him to a detention facility.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In a March 23 interview with an asylum officer, the petitioner claimed that Syrian soldiers had thrice arrested him during demonstrations against the Syrian occupation of Lebanon. He also claimed that the secret police had arrested and beaten him in February of 2001 for distributing anti-Syrian pamphlets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on this account, the asylum officer tentatively determined that the petitioner had a credible fear of persecution on account of his political opinion. The INS duly initiated removal proceedings and served him with a notice to appear in the Immigration Court. Pending the resolution of the petitioner's status, the INS paroled him into the United States. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 212.5(c) (2004). Once on parole, the petitioner traveled to Boston to live with family members. Appearing tele-phonically at a hearing before the Immigration Court, sitting in Florida, the petitioner conceded deportability but sought asylum, withholding of deportation, and relief under CAT. The Immigration Court then granted the petitioner's unopposed motion to transfer the proceedings to Boston. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly thereafter, the petitioner recanted the story he had told at his asylum interview. In a declaration accompanying his asylum application, he stated only that he had posted anti-Syrian political statements on an Internet chat site and had downloaded provocative political material. At a hearing before an immigration judge (IJ) on December 5, 2002, the petitioner admitted that he had concocted the original tale about arrests and beatings. He attributed the fabrication to the advice of a self-styled immigration consultant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having abandoned his fictitious claim of past persecution, the petitioner suggested that he had a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his political opinion. This suggestion traveled along a circuitous path. The petitioner testified that he had opposed the Syrian occupation of Lebanon for some time and had expressed his opposition in Internet chat rooms. In addition, the petitioner's friend, Elias El Gobaly, had asked him to download a brochure calling for the ouster of Syrian forces from Lebanon and featuring a picture of Michel Aoun (the exiled former president of Lebanon and the inspirational figurehead for this virtual protest movement). The petitioner complied, giving multiple copies of the flier to Gobaly, who then distributed them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Syrians arrested Gobaly in December of 2000. The petitioner assumed that the Syrians would torture Gobaly and would force him to reveal the petitioner's role in the production of the brochures. Fearful of these imagined consequences, the petitioner fled the country.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record is silent both as to what treatment Gobaly received and as to what information (if any) Gobaly might have provided to his captors. According to one of the petitioner's brothers (who still resides in Lebanon), the Syrians eventually released Gobaly. The petitioner admitted that he did not know whether Gobaly had named names or under what conditions Gobaly had been detained. Despite these uncertainties, the petitioner expressed fear that the authorities would arrest and torture him if he dared to return to Lebanon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ found little probative value in this reconstructed narrative. Nor did the petitioner's presentation of documentary evidence detailing abusive conduct by Syrian forces toward outspoken supporters of the former president fill this void; the IJ concluded that the petitioner had not brought himself within this sphere. After all, the petitioner himself had never been arrested, detained, or brutalized. Thus, his belief that the Syrians sought his capture rested entirely upon Gobaly's arrest. But, the IJ noted, the petitioner had proffered no evidence illuminating the circumstances surrounding Gobaly's detention, nor had he adduced any proof about what Gobaly might (or might not) have revealed to the authorities. Accordingly, the notion that the Syrians would be on the lookout for the petitioner was, in the IJ's words, \"highly speculative.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the IJ did not make an explicit credibility finding, her skepticism was evident. She reasoned that something more mundane than fear of persecution likely drove the petitioner's desire to emigrate to the United States. The petitioner's father had been in Boston since 1993 and was seeking to become a lawful permanent resident. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255; 8 C.F.R. &#167; 204.5. The petitioner indicated that he had hoped to qualify for permanent residency as his father's dependent and admitted that he had emptied out his father's store in Lebanon before leaving the country. The IJ believed that these admissions supported a plausible inference that the family had made a collective decision to relocate to the United States and that the petitioner's real intention was to join them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on these findings, the IJ held that the petitioner had not established a well-founded fear of future persecution. She thus denied the petitioner's applications for asylum and withholding of deportation. Noting that the Syrian authorities had never laid a finger on the petitioner, the IJ also ruled that the petitioner had wholly failed to show that he would face likely torture if removed to Lebanon. Consequently, the IJ rejected the petitioner's CAT claim as well and ordered him removed to Lebanon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner appealed. The BIA summarily affirmed the IJ's decision on February 6, 2004. This petition for judicial review followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>II.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to become eligible for asylum, an alien must establish that he is a refugee. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1158(b)(1); 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.13(a); <i>see also Laurent v. Ashcroft,</i> 359 F.3d 59, 63 (1st Cir.2004). A refugee is a person unable or unwilling to return to his home country \"because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(42)(A); <i>see Laurent,</i> 359 F.3d at 63-64. A showing of past persecution creates a presumption that an applicant's fear of future persecution is well-founded. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.13(b)(1); <i>see also Fergiste v. INS,</i> 138 F.3d 14, 18 (1st Cir.1998). In the absence of a showing of past persecution, the asylum applicant bears the burden of demonstrating that his fear of future persecution is well-founded. <i>See Laurent,</i> 359 F.3d at 65.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When an IJ rejects an alien's application for asylum and orders his removal, the BIA has jurisdiction to review the order upon the filing of a timely appeal. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1003.1(b), 1240.15; <i>see also Nugent v. Ashcroft,</i> 367 F.3d 162, 165 (3d Cir.2004). \"Where, as here, the BIA conducts a de novo review of the record, independently validates the sufficiency of the evidence, and adopts the IJ's findings and conclusions, the IJ's findings become the BIA's.\" <i>Laurent,</i> 359 F.3d at 64 n. 3. We review the BIA's order pursuant to the authority conferred by 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review is deferential. In immigration cases, the court of appeals applies the familiar \"substantial evidence\" standard of review. It must uphold the BIA's decision \"unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(b)(4)(B). Put another way, a reviewing court can reverse the BIA only if the record unequivocally indicates error. <i>INS v. Elias-Zacarias,</i> 502 U.S. 478, 481 &amp; n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Indeed, if an asylum applicant's fact-based challenge to an unfavorable decision is to succeed, \"the administrative record, viewed in its entirety, must compel the conclusion that he is asylum-eligible.\" <i>Aguilar-Solis v. INS,</i> 168 F.3d 565, 569 (1st Cir.1999) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, we turn to the specifics of the petitioner's claims. For the first time on appeal, the petitioner contends that he has suffered past persecution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> This argument starts with the premise that the Syrian occupiers exercise brutal control over the Lebanese people. That premise is supported by documentary evidence in the record and we accept it. Building on this uncontroversial foundation, the petitioner suggests that Gobaly's arrest placed him (the petitioner) in a state of intense anxiety, exacerbated by a fear that his own arrest and abuse were imminent. From this, the petitioner argues that he experienced psychological torment, which amounted to \"persecution\" in the statutory sense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a theoretical matter, we acknowledge that, under the right set of circumstances, a finding of past persecution might rest on a showing of psychological harm. <i>See, e.g., Miljkovic v. Ashcroft,</i> 376 F.3d 754, 756 (7th Cir.2004); <i>Knezevic v. Ashcroft,</i> 367 F.3d 1206, 1211-12 (9th Cir.2004); <i>Ouda v. INS,</i> 324 F.3d 445, 453-55 (6th Cir.2003); <i>see also Boykov v. INS,</i> 109 F.3d 413, 416 (7th Cir.1997) (expressing willingness, in rare cases, to regard mere threats as persecution). Here, however, the issue of past persecution is not fairly before us. The controlling statute, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(d)(1), provides that review of a final removal order is only permissible if \"the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\" We have interpreted this statute to mean that theories not advanced before the BIA may not be surfaced for the first time in a petition for judicial review of the BIA's final order. <i>See Ravindran v. INS,</i> 976 F.2d 754, 761 (1st Cir.1992); <i>Alvarez-Flores v. INS,</i> 909 F.2d 1, 8 (1st Cir.1990). This same principle of preclusion extends to claims not raised before the IJ. <i>See Debab v. INS,</i> 163 F.3d 21, 26 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This template is dispositive of the petitioner's belated claim of past persecution. The petitioner did not raise this contention either in the declaration that accompanied his asylum application or in his testimony before the IJ. Nor did he, in either of those fora, assert a claim of psychological persecution. Given these procedural defaults, we decline to entertain his virgin claim of past persecution in this venue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves the petitioner's claim that he harbors a well-founded fear of future persecution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Such a claim has both subjective and objective components. To establish asylum eligibility on this ground, an applicant must demonstrate both that he genuinely fears persecution if he is deported to his homeland and that his fear is objectively reasonable. <i>Laurent,</i> 359 F.3d at 65. An applicant typically will show genuineness through his own credible testimony. <i>See, e.g., Balogun v. Ashcroft,</i> 374 F.3d 492, 499 (7th Cir.2004). The more difficult burden is to show that his fear is objectively reasonable. To carry this burden, the applicant need not prove that he will more likely than not suffer future persecution. <i>See INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca,</i> 480 U.S. 421, 450, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). Rather, his proof suffices if it shows that \"a reasonable person in the asylum applicant's circumstances would fear persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground.\" <i>Aguilar-Solis,</i> 168 F.3d at 572.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the petitioner makes two arguments to support his insistence that he has a well-founded fear of persecution if deported. We deal with these arguments separately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's first argument is that he fears persecution on account of his membership in a particular social group. This argument is hopeless. For one thing, he has failed to identify the particular social group with which he claims to be affiliated. For another thing, throughout the proceedings below the petitioner sought asylum solely on the basis that he would be persecuted for his political opinion. Because he neglected to raise the \"social group\" issue before the IJ, that issue is procedurally defaulted. <i>See Debab,</i> 163 F.3d at 26.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's second argument &#8212; that he fears future persecution on the basis of political opinion &#8212; forms the crux of his asylum application. To satisfy the subjective component of the well-founded fear standard, the petitioner testified as to the genuineness of his concern. The IJ, without explicitly impugning the petitioner's credibility, suggested obliquely that his efforts to benefit derivatively from his father's quest to become a lawful permanent resident and the fact that he had spent his final months in Lebanon cleaning out the family store may have had more to do with his flight to the United States than his fear of future events in Lebanon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner argues that, in the absence of an adverse credibility finding, these facts are irrelevant to a resolution of whether his fear of persecution is genuine. We do not agree. What is in a person's mind cannot be measured with scientific precision, and if the evidence fairly suggests that a reason other than a fear of persecution provides the primary impetus for an alien's desire to seek asylum, that certainly bears on the genuineness of his subjective claim. <i>See, e.g., Lin v. Ashcroft,</i> 371 F.3d 18, 22 (1st Cir.2004); <i>Disu v. Ashcroft,</i> 338 F.3d 13, 16 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, the record is less than pellucid on this point. It is hard to tell whether the IJ's decision implicitly incorporates a finding that the petitioner's fear was less than genuine. Because that question is open to interpretation, we leave it unresolved. In this case, the petitioner's fear, even if subjectively genuine, is not well-founded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The asserted fear of future persecution on account of political opinion stems from Gobaly's arrest and the possibility that Gobaly may have identified the petitioner as a dissident and/or participant in seditious activities. The petitioner buttresses the claim with documentary evidence of widespread human rights abuses in Lebanon. From these loosely related pieces of evidence, he invited the IJ to construct a chain of inferences suggesting the possibility that he would be persecuted if deported. The IJ declined the invitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We discern no hint of error. The chain of inferences fashioned by the petitioner is woven from gossamer strands of speculation and surmise. The petitioner himself has never been arrested, detained, or otherwise harmed. Indeed, there is absolutely no evidence that he has even attracted the attention of the Syrian occupiers. As far as anyone can tell, both he and his activities in cyberspace have gone unnoticed. This is not the stuff of which objectively reasonable fears of future persecution are constructed. <i>See Pieterson v. Ashcroft,</i> 364 F.3d 38, 45 (1st Cir.2004) (stating that lack of past arrest or detention made alien's chance of being individually targeted less likely); <i>Ravindran,</i> 976 F.2d at 759 (declining to credit alien's professed fear of being singled out for persecution in the absence of any evidence that authorities knew about his political activities). Here, moreover, the claim of possible future persecution is made even more tenuous by the total lack of any evidence that Gobaly himself was mistreated or even interrogated during his detention. From aught that appears, Gobaly never spoke to the authorities at any time about the assistance that the petitioner had privately rendered &#8212; or, at least, there is no proof that he did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another circumstance militates in favor of the IJ's ruling. The petitioner's level of political activism does not suggest that of a leader or even a follower. His political speech was limited to Internet chat rooms (fora that arguably provide a certain expectation of anonymity), and he engaged in just one solitary act of opposition by printing seditious leaflets. That act was carried out in the privacy of his own home. As the basis for an asylum application, this diminutive political profile tends to make the petitioner's asserted fear of persecution less reasonable. <i>See Pieterson,</i> 364 F.3d at 44-45.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the supporting documentation paints a troubling portrait of the situation in Lebanon. Human rights obviously are not a high priority there. Still, over and above random atrocities, the most that this generic evidence shows is that Syrian forces have targeted political dissidents who have come to their attention. Absent a connection with the petitioner &#8212; an individual who has never publicly been involved in political protest and who, insofar as the record reflects, has never come up on the Syrians' radar screen &#8212; this evidence does not go very far toward showing objective reasonableness of the petitioner's professed fear. <i>See Morales v. INS,</i> 208 F.3d 323, 331 (1st Cir.2000). Weighing this evidence in light of the record as a whole, we cannot say that the IJ was compelled to reach a conclusion favorable to the petitioner on the question of whether the latter's professed fear of future persecution on account of his political opinion was well-founded. <i>See Aguilar-Solis,</i> 168 F.3d at 572.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That effectively ends the matter. Because substantial evidence supports the denial of asylum, we need not address the petitioner's other claims. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A claim for withholding of deportation demands that the alien carry a more stringent burden of proof than does an asylum claim. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1231(b)(3)(A). Thus, if an alien cannot establish asylum eligibility, his claim for withholding of deportation fails a fortiori. <i>See Ipina v. INS,</i> 868 F.2d 511, 515 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's skeletal claim for relief under CAT fares no better. What we have written to this point demonstrates that the CAT claim is beyond redemption. At any rate, the petitioner has wholly failed to develop any argumentation on that claim before us. Consequently, we deem that portion of his petition waived. <i>See Aguilar-Solis,</i> 168 F.3d at 574; <i>Athehortua-Vanegas v. INS,</i> 876 F.2d 238, 241 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>III.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Amid a sea of global violence, Congress dug a narrow channel of relief for those who face possible future persecution. The statutory requirement that an applicant for asylum show a well-founded fear of persecution demands more than this petitioner has mustered. Since the IJ's decision and the BIA's order rest on a plausible rendition of the record, the petition for review must be denied and dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>It is so ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub.L. 107-296, &#167; 471, 116 Stat. 2135, 2205 (codified as amended at 6 U.S.C. &#167; 291(a)), abolished the INS and transferred its duties to the Department of Homeland Security<i>See Lattab v.

Concluding, as we do, that the BIA's order is supported by substantial evidence, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>I.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner, now twenty-two years of age, arrived at Miami International Airport on March 15, 2001. He had no visa. Instead, he presented his Lebanese passport at the immigration counter and requested asylum. Agents of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) took him to a detention facility.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In a March 23 interview with an asylum officer, the petitioner claimed that Syrian soldiers had thrice arrested him during demonstrations against the Syrian occupation of Lebanon. He also claimed that the secret police had arrested and beaten him in February of 2001 for distributing anti-Syrian pamphlets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on this account, the asylum officer tentatively determined that the petitioner had a credible fear of persecution on account of his political opinion. The INS duly initiated removal proceedings and served him with a notice to appear in the Immigration Court. Pending the resolution of the petitioner's status, the INS paroled him into the United States. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 212.5(c) (2004). Once on parole, the petitioner traveled to Boston to live with family members. Appearing tele-phonically at a hearing before the Immigration Court, sitting in Florida, the petitioner conceded deportability but sought asylum, withholding of deportation, and relief under CAT. The Immigration Court then granted the petitioner's unopposed motion to transfer the proceedings to Boston. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly thereafter, the petitioner recanted the story he had told at his asylum interview. In a declaration accompanying his asylum application, he stated only that he had posted anti-Syrian political statements on an Internet chat site and had downloaded provocative political material. At a hearing before an immigration judge (IJ) on December 5, 2002, the petitioner admitted that he had concocted the original tale about arrests and beatings. He attributed the fabrication to the advice of a self-styled immigration consultant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having abandoned his fictitious claim of past persecution, the petitioner suggested that he had a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his political opinion. This suggestion traveled along a circuitous path. The petitioner testified that he had opposed the Syrian occupation of Lebanon for some time and had expressed his opposition in Internet chat rooms. In addition, the petitioner's friend, Elias El Gobaly, had asked him to download a brochure calling for the ouster of Syrian forces from Lebanon and featuring a picture of Michel Aoun (the exiled former president of Lebanon and the inspirational figurehead for this virtual protest movement). The petitioner complied, giving multiple copies of the flier to Gobaly, who then distributed them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Syrians arrested Gobaly in December of 2000. The petitioner assumed that the Syrians would torture Gobaly and would force him to reveal the petitioner's role in the production of the brochures. Fearful of these imagined consequences, the petitioner fled the country.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record is silent both as to what treatment Gobaly received and as to what information (if any) Gobaly might have provided to his captors. According to one of the petitioner's brothers (who still resides in Lebanon), the Syrians eventually released Gobaly. The petitioner admitted that he did not know whether Gobaly had named names or under what conditions Gobaly had been detained. Despite these uncertainties, the petitioner expressed fear that the authorities would arrest and torture him if he dared to return to Lebanon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ found little probative value in this reconstructed narrative. Nor did the petitioner's presentation of documentary evidence detailing abusive conduct by Syrian forces toward outspoken supporters of the former president fill this void; the IJ concluded that the petitioner had not brought himself within this sphere. After all, the petitioner himself had never been arrested, detained, or brutalized. Thus, his belief that the Syrians sought his capture rested entirely upon Gobaly's arrest. But, the IJ noted, the petitioner had proffered no evidence illuminating the circumstances surrounding Gobaly's detention, nor had he adduced any proof about what Gobaly might (or might not) have revealed to the authorities. Accordingly, the notion that the Syrians would be on the lookout for the petitioner was, in the IJ's words, \"highly speculative.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the IJ did not make an explicit credibility finding, her skepticism was evident. She reasoned that something more mundane than fear of persecution likely drove the petitioner's desire to emigrate to the United States. The petitioner's father had been in Boston since 1993 and was seeking to become a lawful permanent resident. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255; 8 C.F.R. &#167; 204.5. The petitioner indicated that he had hoped to qualify for permanent residency as his father's dependent and admitted that he had emptied out his father's store in Lebanon before leaving the country. The IJ believed that these admissions supported a plausible inference that the family had made a collective decision to relocate to the United States and that the petitioner's real intention was to join them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on these findings, the IJ held that the petitioner had not established a well-founded fear of future persecution. She thus denied the petitioner's applications for asylum and withholding of deportation. Noting that the Syrian authorities had never laid a finger on the petitioner, the IJ also ruled that the petitioner had wholly failed to show that he would face likely torture if removed to Lebanon. Consequently, the IJ rejected the petitioner's CAT claim as well and ordered him removed to Lebanon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner appealed.

For the first time on appeal, the petitioner contends that he has suffered past persecution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> This argument starts with the premise that the Syrian occupiers exercise brutal control over the Lebanese people. That premise is supported by documentary evidence in the record and we accept it. Building on this uncontroversial foundation, the petitioner suggests that Gobaly's arrest placed him (the petitioner) in a state of intense anxiety, exacerbated by a fear that his own arrest and abuse were imminent. From this, the petitioner argues that he experienced psychological torment, which amounted to \"persecution\" in the statutory sense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a theoretical matter, we acknowledge that, under the right set of circumstances, a finding of past persecution might rest on a showing of psychological harm. <i>See, e.g., Miljkovic v.

Here, however, the issue of past persecution is not fairly before us. The controlling statute, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(d)(1), provides that review of a final removal order is only permissible if \"the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\" We have interpreted this statute to mean that theories not advanced before the BIA may not be surfaced for the first time in a petition for judicial review of the BIA's final order. <i>See Ravindran v.

This same principle of preclusion extends to claims not raised before the IJ. <i>See Debab v.

The petitioner did not raise this contention either in the declaration that accompanied his asylum application or in his testimony before the IJ. Nor did he, in either of those fora, assert a claim of psychological persecution. Given these procedural defaults, we decline to entertain his virgin claim of past persecution in this venue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves the petitioner's claim that he harbors a well-founded fear of future persecution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Such a claim has both subjective and objective components. To establish asylum eligibility on this ground, an applicant must demonstrate both that he genuinely fears persecution if he is deported to his homeland and that his fear is objectively reasonable. <i>Laurent,</i> 359 F.3d at 65. An applicant typically will show genuineness through his own credible testimony. <i>See, e.g., Balogun v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786826\"><a href=\"/opinion/786826/yetunde-balogun-v-john-d-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">374</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></a></span>, 499 (7th Cir.2004). The more difficult burden is to show that his fear is objectively reasonable. To carry this burden, the applicant need not prove that he will more likely than not suffer future persecution. <i>See INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111838\"><a href=\"/opinion/111838/ins-v-cardoza-fonseca/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">421</span></a></span>, 450, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111838\"><a href=\"/opinion/111838/ins-v-cardoza-fonseca/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">434</span></a></span> (1987). Rather, his proof suffices if it shows that \"a reasonable person in the asylum applicant's circumstances would fear persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground.\" <i>Aguilar-Solis,</i> 168 F.3d at 572.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the petitioner makes two arguments to support his insistence that he has a well-founded fear of persecution if deported. We deal with these arguments separately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's first argument is that he fears persecution on account of his membership in a particular social group. This argument is hopeless. For one thing, he has failed to identify the particular social group with which he claims to be affiliated. For another thing, throughout the proceedings below the petitioner sought asylum solely on the basis that he would be persecuted for his political opinion. Because he neglected to raise the \"social group\" issue before the IJ, that issue is procedurally defaulted. <i>See Debab,</i> 163 F.3d at 26.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's second argument &#8212; that he fears future persecution on the basis of political opinion &#8212; forms the crux of his asylum application. To satisfy the subjective component of the well-founded fear standard, the petitioner testified as to the genuineness of his concern. The IJ, without explicitly impugning the petitioner's credibility, suggested obliquely that his efforts to benefit derivatively from his father's quest to become a lawful permanent resident and the fact that he had spent his final months in Lebanon cleaning out the family store may have had more to do with his flight to the United States than his fear of future events in Lebanon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner argues that, in the absence of an adverse credibility finding, these facts are irrelevant to a resolution of whether his fear of persecution is genuine. We do not agree. What is in a person's mind cannot be measured with scientific precision, and if the evidence fairly suggests that a reason other than a fear of persecution provides the primary impetus for an alien's desire to seek asylum, that certainly bears on the genuineness of his subjective claim. <i>See, e.g., Lin v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201056\"><a href=\"/opinion/201056/lin-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">371</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir.2004); <i>Disu v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200581\"><a href=\"/opinion/200581/disu-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">338</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, the record is less than pellucid on this point. It is hard to tell whether the IJ's decision implicitly incorporates a finding that the petitioner's fear was less than genuine. Because that question is open to interpretation, we leave it unresolved. In this case, the petitioner's fear, even if subjectively genuine, is not well-founded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The asserted fear of future persecution on account of political opinion stems from Gobaly's arrest and the possibility that Gobaly may have identified the petitioner as a dissident and/or participant in seditious activities. The petitioner buttresses the claim with documentary evidence of widespread human rights abuses in Lebanon. From these loosely related pieces of evidence, he invited the IJ to construct a chain of inferences suggesting the possibility that he would be persecuted if deported. The IJ declined the invitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We discern no hint of error. The chain of inferences fashioned by the petitioner is woven from gossamer strands of speculation and surmise. The petitioner himself has never been arrested, detained, or otherwise harmed. Indeed, there is absolutely no evidence that he has even attracted the attention of the Syrian occupiers. As far as anyone can tell, both he and his activities in cyberspace have gone unnoticed. This is not the stuff of which objectively reasonable fears of future persecution are constructed. <i>See Pieterson v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200965\"><a href=\"/opinion/200965/pieterson-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">364</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span>, 45 (1st Cir.2004) (stating that lack of past arrest or detention made alien's chance of being individually targeted less likely); <i>Ravindran,</i> 976 F.2d at 759 (declining to credit alien's professed fear of being singled out for persecution in the absence of any evidence that authorities knew about his political activities). Here, moreover, the claim of possible future persecution is made even more tenuous by the total lack of any evidence that Gobaly himself was mistreated or even interrogated during his detention. From aught that appears, Gobaly never spoke to the authorities at any time about the assistance that the petitioner had privately rendered &#8212; or, at least, there is no proof that he did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another circumstance militates in favor of the IJ's ruling. The petitioner's level of political activism does not suggest that of a leader or even a follower. His political speech was limited to Internet chat rooms (fora that arguably provide a certain expectation of anonymity), and he engaged in just one solitary act of opposition by printing seditious leaflets. That act was carried out in the privacy of his own home. As the basis for an asylum application, this diminutive political profile tends to make the petitioner's asserted fear of persecution less reasonable. <i>See Pieterson,</i> 364 F.3d at 44-45.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the supporting documentation paints a troubling portrait of the situation in Lebanon. Human rights obviously are not a high priority there. Still, over and above random atrocities, the most that this generic evidence shows is that Syrian forces have targeted political dissidents who have come to their attention. Absent a connection with the petitioner &#8212; an individual who has never publicly been involved in political protest and who, insofar as the record reflects, has never come up on the Syrians' radar screen &#8212; this evidence does not go very far toward showing objective reasonableness of the petitioner's professed fear. <i>See Morales v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768205\"><a href=\"/opinion/768205/juan-antonio-morales-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">208</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">323</span></a></span>, 331 (1st Cir.2000). Weighing this evidence in light of the record as a whole, we cannot say that the IJ was compelled to reach a conclusion favorable to the petitioner on the question of whether the latter's professed fear of future persecution on account of his political opinion was well-founded. <i>See Aguilar-Solis,</i> 168 F.3d at 572.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That effectively ends the matter. Because substantial evidence supports the denial of asylum, we need not address the petitioner's other claims. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A claim for withholding of deportation demands that the alien carry a more stringent burden of proof than does an asylum claim. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1231(b)(3)(A). Thus, if an alien cannot establish asylum eligibility, his claim for withholding of deportation fails a fortiori. <i>See Ipina v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"518840\"><a href=\"/opinion/518840/francisca-sophia-ipina-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">868</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span>, 515 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's skeletal claim for relief under CAT fares no better. What we have written to this point demonstrates that the CAT claim is beyond redemption. At any rate, the petitioner has wholly failed to develop any argumentation on that claim before us. Consequently, we deem that portion of his petition waived. <i>See Aguilar-Solis,</i> 168 F.3d at 574; <i>Athehortua-Vanegas v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524261\"><a href=\"/opinion/524261/luis-n-athehortua-vanegas-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">876</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span>, 241 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>III.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Amid a sea of global violence, Congress dug a narrow channel of relief for those who face possible future persecution. The statutory requirement that an applicant for asylum show a well-founded fear of persecution demands more than this petitioner has mustered. Since the IJ's decision and the BIA's order rest on a plausible rendition of the record, the petition for review must be denied and dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>It is so ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub.L. 107-296, &#167; 471, 116 Stat. 2135, 2205 (codified as amended at 6 U.S.C. &#167; 291(a)), abolished the INS and transferred its duties to the Department of Homeland Security<i>See Lattab v.
