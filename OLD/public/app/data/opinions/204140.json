Joseph L. Tauro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n                   Boudin and Selya, Circuit Judges,\n                    and Laplante,* District Judge.\n\n\n     Abby Wright and Samantha Chaifetz, Appellate Staff, Civil\nDivision, Department of Justice, with whom Tony West, Assistant\nAttorney General, Michael K.

Mizner, Assistant Federal Public Defender, Federal\nDefender Office, for respondent, appellee/cross-appellant.\n\n\n\n                           January 15, 2010\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.\n\f           BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.      The federal government sought to\n\ncommit Todd Carta under the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety\n\nAct, Pub L. No. 109-248, 120 Stat. 587 (2006) (\"Adam Walsh Act\").\n\nThat statute authorizes civil commitment of a person already in\n\nfederal   custody,   including   one   finishing   a   sentence   after   a\n\ncriminal conviction, if the government shows that he is a \"sexually\n\ndangerous person.\"    18 U.S.C. § 4248 (2006).         The district court\n\nheld that the government failed to make the necessary showing; the\n\ngovernment now appeals, and Carta cross-appeals claiming that the\n\nstatute is unconstitutional.\n\n           After pleading guilty to child pornography charges in\n\nOctober 2002, Carta was sentenced to five years in federal prison\n\nand three years of supervised release.      Three years into his term,\n\nCarta requested and was granted a transfer to a federal prison in\n\nNorth Carolina offering a sex offender treatment program.           Carta\n\nparticipated in the program for approximately seven months, but\n\nthen withdrew without completing the program.\n\n           Carta's treating psychologist noted that even within the\n\nprogram, he exhibited problematic behavior: reinforcing the deviant\n\nbeliefs of others in the program, denying that his behavior was\n\ninappropriate and acting impulsively.       Further, Carta dropped out\n\nof the program partly because of his inability to curb his sexual\n\ninterest the program's younger participants, which resulted in\n\nrestrictions being imposed on his contact with them.\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\f          In the course of the program, Carta disclosed details of\n\nhis sexual and criminal history that prompted the government's\n\ninvocation of the Adam Walsh Act's commitment procedures (in\n\nshorthand, \"section 4248\").      Carta described his primary sexual\n\ninterest as children age 12 to 17 and his secondary interest as\n\nchildren age 7 to 11, and admitted to having a large child\n\npornography collection; he usually stored between 10,000 and 20,000\n\nimages on his computer and spent 12 to 14 hours daily looking at\n\nchild pornography prior to his arrest.\n\n          Carta further admitted to sexually abusing minors on many\n\noccasions, with his youngest victim being a child in diapers.\n\nCarta's long history of sexually abusing minors is detailed in the\n\ndistrict court opinion, United States v. Carta, 620 F. Supp. 2d\n\n210, 212-14 (D. Mass. 2009), and we draw on it (subject to a few\n\ncorrections based on our own reading of the record).\n\n                 •Between the ages of 11 and 13, Carta\n          performed oral sex on a child in diapers who\n          was no more than three or four years old one\n          time and on the diapered-child's seven-year-\n          old cousin about 10 times; the seven-year-old\n          also performed oral sex on Carta.\n\n                  •When he was 15 or 16, Carta shot with\n          a BB gun a similar-aged male when the peer\n          refused to engage in oral sex; later, Carta\n          talked him into oral sex and they engaged in\n          it approximately 10 times over a five year\n          period.\n\n                    •At age 21, on multiple occasions Carta\n          engaged     in oral sex with his 16-year-old\n          nephew.\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f                 •Between   ages  28   and  34,    Carta\n          committed multiple sexual offenses while\n          following a rock band; among these were\n          offering a 13-year-old boy concert tickets in\n          exchange for oral sex and fondling and\n          masturbating a 17 or 18-year-old male who was\n          passed out from drug use in Carta's van.\n\n                 •When Carta was 30 or 31, he began\n          sexually abusing a 13-year-old boy, whom he\n          had sexual contact with 30 to 40 times over a\n          four year period and referred to as his\n          \"boyfriend.\"\n\n                 •At age 33, he engaged in sexual\n          contact on separate occasions with two 16-\n          year-old males and one 16-year-old female, all\n          of whom he met on the Internet.\n\n                 •When Carta was 39, he met a 17-year-\n          old male who started living with him; on at\n          least one occasion, Carta orally copulated the\n          17-year-old's younger brother, who was 15 at\n          the time.   Carta also sexually abused a 13-\n          year-old   boy  he   met   on  the   Internet,\n          performing oral sex on him on multiple\n          occasions; one time, Carta convinced the 13-\n          year-old to have \"three-way sex\" with Carta\n          and the 17-year-old.\n\n          On March 7, 2007--two days prior to Carta's scheduled\n\ngood-time release date--the Bureau of Prisons certified that Carta,\n\nwho was being held in a federal facility in Massachusetts, was a\n\n\"sexually dangerous person\" and began civil commitment proceedings\n\nunder section 4248.   Carta moved to dismiss, arguing the statute\n\nwas facially unconstitutional on multiple grounds, but after a\n\nhearing the district court denied the motion.     United States v.\n\nCarta, 503 F. Supp. 2d 405, 407 (D. Mass. 2007).    The denial was\n\n\n\n\n                               -4-\n\fwithout prejudice to an as-applied challenge, which Carta never\n\nmade.\n\n               In February 2009, the district court held a three-day\n\nbench       trial   on   whether   Carta    met   the   requirements    for     civil\n\ncommitment under section 4248. Experts testified on both sides.\n\nThe government expert, Dr. Amy Phenix, testified that, based on\n\nrisk factors such as age, frequency of misconduct and lack of\n\nsuccess in treatment, Carta would have serious difficulty in\n\nrefraining from child molestation if released.1                    Dr. Phenix said\n\nthat Carta suffered from a mental disorder known as \"paraphilia not\n\notherwise specified\" that was characterized by \"hebephilia.\"\n\n               Paraphilia     is   characterized        by   the   Diagnostic    and\n\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders (\"DSM\"), a commonly used\n\nreference book in the fields of psychiatry and psychology, as\n\nfollows:\n\n               The essential features of a Paraphilia are\n               recurrent,    intense    sexually   arousing\n               fantasies,   sexual   urges,   or  behaviors\n               generally involving 1) nonhuman objects, 2)\n               the suffering or humiliation of oneself or\n               one's partner, or 3) children or other\n               nonconsenting persons, that occur over a\n               period of at least 6 months . . . [and that]\n\n\n        1\n      Dr. Phenix's report, like the report of Carta's expert Dr.\nLeonard Bard, is under seal; but we note that her diagnosis and\nevaluation of dangerousness did not rest simply on Carta's\nconfession of past incidents but also on his behavior in prison,\nhis statements about his present feelings and a set of standardized\nevaluative   measurements    based    primarily   on    correlating\ncharacteristics of the individual with statistical data about re-\noffense.\n\n                                           -5-\n\f            cause clinically significant distress or\n            impairment in social, occupational, or other\n            important areas of functioning . . . .\n\nAm.   Psychiatric   Ass'n,      DSM    522-23    (4th    ed.    2000).     Carta's\n\ncondition was described by Dr. Phenix as paraphilia not otherwise\n\nspecified    because    hebephilia--loosely,            sexual    attraction     to\n\nadolescents, Carta, 620 F. Supp. 2d at 217--is not itself an\n\nabnormality specifically listed in the DSM nor is it one of the\n\nspecific examples of paraphilia listed in the DSM.                  By contrast,\n\npedophilia, sexual attraction to children before puberty, is a\n\nlisted variety of paraphilia in the DSM.                DSM, supra, at 527-28.\n\n            Dr. Bard, an expert designated at Carta's request, see 18\n\nU.S.C. § 4247(b), conceded that Carta suffered from \"numerous\n\nproblems\" but--based in part on Dr. Bard's own test results--\n\nconcluded    that   Carta    would     not   have       serious    difficulty     in\n\nrefraining from child molestation if released.                     Dr. Bard also\n\nasserted that hebephilia was not a generally accepted diagnosis in\n\nthe mental health community, did not fit within the DSM definition\n\nof    paraphilia,   lacked   diagnostic         criteria    and    could   not    be\n\nconsistently defined; that normal adults may find adolescents\n\narousing; and that articles offered by the government to support a\n\nhebephilia diagnosis were not legitimate peer-reviewed research.\n\n            In   June   2009,    the    district        court    ruled   that    the\n\ngovernment had not proved by clear and convincing evidence that\n\nCarta was a \"sexually dangerous person\" within the meaning of the\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fAdam Walsh Act.        Carta, 620 F. Supp. 2d at 226-27.               Relying on Dr.\n\nBard's    reasoning,         the   district       court    concluded    that   Carta's\n\ndiagnosis of paraphilia not otherwise specified characterized by\n\nhebephilia was not a \"serious mental illness, abnormality, or\n\ndisorder\" under the statute.                Id. at 222-27.          Because having a\n\ndefined mental condition is a prerequisite for commitment under\n\nsection 4248, the court did not reach the separate question of\n\nwhether    Carta     would     have    serious       difficulty     refraining   from\n\nmolestation if released.             Id. at 229.          We stayed Carta's release\n\npending the government's expedited appeal.\n\n              Chapter 313 of the Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C. §§ 4241-4248,\n\naddresses competency to stand trial, disposition of those found not\n\nguilty by reason of insanity and treatment of those in custody who\n\nare found to be suffering from a mental disease or defect.                          One\n\nprovision authorizes, and provides procedures for, id. §§ 4246(a)-\n\n(g), continued commitment of individuals in federal custody--\n\notherwise      due     for     release--where        release      would   \"create     a\n\nsubstantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious\n\ndamage to property of another\" by reason of a \"mental disease or\n\ndefect,\" id. § 4246(a).\n\n              Appended, with cross-references to the basic scheme, is\n\na   section    added    by     the   Adam    Walsh    Act    that   addresses    civil\n\ncommitment of \"a sexually dangerous person\" who is in the custody\n\nof the Attorney General or Bureau of Prisons; commitment may\n\n\n                                            -7-\n\fcontinue until that person is transferred to state care or \"is no\n\nlonger sexually dangerous to others\" or until that danger can be\n\ncontrolled by outpatient care and treatment. 18 U.S.C. §§ 4248(a),\n\n(d).   \"Sexually dangerous person\" and \"sexually dangerous to\n\nothers\" are defined, and the former includes the requirements of\n\nthe latter. Id. §§ 4247(a)(5),(6). The combination requires three\n\nelements:\n\n            a prior act (or attempted act) of \"violent\n            sexual conduct or child molestation\";\n\n            \"a serious mental illness, abnormality, or\n            disorder\"; and\n\n            a resulting \"serious difficulty in refraining\n            from sexually violent conduct or child\n            molestation if released.\"\n\n            Carta   does   not   deny   that   he   has   engaged   in    child\n\nmolestation in the past, and the district judge so found.                Carta,\n\n620 F. Supp. 2d at 221-22.         Thus, whether the government could\n\ncommit Carta turned on whether he suffered from \"a serious mental\n\nillness, abnormality, or disorder\" and whether he would have\n\n\"serious difficulty\" in refraining from further child molestation.\n\nAs already noted, the district judge did not reach the latter\n\nquestion because he ruled the government had failed to show that\n\nCarta suffered from the necessary mental condition.\n\n            On review, we distinguish between what the statute means,\n\nquestions of raw fact and the intermediate step of characterizing\n\nthe raw facts in the terms of the statute thus defined.             The first\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fissue, statutory interpretation, we review de novo, United States\n\nv. Frechette, 456 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2006); the second is one of\n\nfact-finding, reviewed for clear error, Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a)(6);\n\nand the last is the problem of applying a general standard to\n\nspecific facts in which some deference is ordinarily accorded the\n\nfact-finder, United States v. Jahagirdar, 466 F.3d 149, 156 (1st\n\nCir. 2006).\n\n            The district court may have assumed that the statutory\n\nconcept is delimited by the consensus of the medical community, but\n\nthis is not so.2    Further, a mental disorder or defect need not\n\nnecessarily be one so identified in the DSM in order to meet the\n\nstatutory   requirement;   several   state   decisions   on   counterpart\n\nstatutes have so held. See, e.g., In re Commitment of Frankovitch,\n\n121 P.3d 1240, 1245 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2005); In re Care and Treatment\n\nof Dahl, 167 P.3d 387, 2007 WL 2768036, at *2 (Kan. Ct. App. 2007);\n\nCommonwealth v. Starkus, 867 N.E.2d 811, 819-20 (Mass. App. Ct.\n\n2007).   But in the present case the central problem is that there\n\nis no conflict between the DSM and the government's position, which\n\nthe district court appears to have misunderstood.\n\n\n     2\n      See Kansas v. Crane, 534 U.S. 407, 413 (2002) (\"[T]he science\nof psychiatry, which informs but does not control ultimate legal\ndeterminations, is an ever-advancing science, whose distinctions do\nnot seek precisely to mirror those of the law.\"); Kansas v.\nHendricks, 521 U.S. 346, 359 (1997) (same); see also H.R. Rep. 109-\n218, pt. 1, at 29 (rejecting for section 4248 a \"narrow\" approach\nto what mental conditions trigger the statute and stating that the\nstatute instead adopts \"commitment standards substantively similar\nto those approved by the Supreme Court\" in Crane and Hendricks).\n\n                                 -9-\n\f            Believing this to be the position of other federal\n\ncourts,3 the district court rejected hebephilia as a \"serious\n\nmental illness, abnormality, or disorder,\" concluding that it does\n\nnot   fit   within   the   DSM   category   of   paraphilia   not   otherwise\n\nspecified and is not otherwise found within the DSM.          Carta, 620 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 223-24.        The court also considered whether classing\n\nhebephilia as a mental disorder was \"supported by research in the\n\nfield of psychology\" and whether it was \"generally accepted in the\n\npsychiatric and psychological community,\" finding that although\n\nthere is some dispute in the field, hebephilia is \"not generally\n\nrecognized as a serious mental illness.\"           Id. at 225-26.\n\n            The problem with the district court's approach is that\n\nparaphilia is expressly a DSM-listed disorder and Carta appears to\n\nfall within this category.        The \"essential features\" of paraphilia\n\nare \"recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges,\n\nor behaviors\" fixated on a specific \"stimuli,\" which \"occur over a\n\nperiod of at least 6 months\" and \"cause clinically significant\n\ndistress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important\n\nareas of functioning.\"      DSM, supra, at 522-23.     The DSM states that\n\nfrequent objects of fixation are \"nonhuman objects,\" \"the suffering\n\n\n\n      3\n      The district court asserted that \"[t]he only federal courts\nto have addressed the diagnosis of hebephilia in sexually dangerous\nperson cases have rejected it as a basis for commitment.\" Carta,\n620 F. Supp. 2d at 222 (citing United States v. Shields, 2008 WL\n544940, at *2 (D. Mass. Feb. 26, 2008) and United States v.\nAbregana, 574 F. Supp. 2d 1145, 1159 (D. Haw. 2008)).\n\n                                     -10-\n\for humiliation of oneself or one's partner,\" and \"children or other\n\nnonconsenting persons.\"   Id.   At first blush, one might think that\n\na number of those abused by Carta fall easily within the category\n\nof \"children or other nonconsenting persons.\"\n\n          But in any case the DSM includes a catch-all category\n\ncalled \"paraphilia not otherwise specified\" that lists, simply as\n\nexamples, types of paraphilia, such as fixation on obscene phone\n\ncalls, specific body parts, feces or urine.     DSM, supra, at 532.\n\nBased on Dr. Phenix's report, Carta's past history of sexually\n\nabusing minors, his in-prison behavior and his expressed attitudes\n\nseemingly justify classifying him as suffering from a paraphilia:\n\nhe has a decades-long sexual fixation on minors that plainly has\n\n\"caused significant distress or impairment\" in his life.\n\n          With one exception, nothing in Dr. Bard's report appears\n\ndirectly to contradict this classification.    The exception--which\n\nthe district judge noted but did not expressly adopt, see Carta,\n\n620 F. Supp. 2d at 223--is this: in his testimony (rather than his\n\nreport), Dr. Bard took the position that the term \"children\" in the\n\nphrase \"children or other nonconsenting persons,\" which the DSM\n\nuses as an example of a common category of fixations that often\n\nunderlie paraphilia, refers only to prepubescent children. He also\n\nstated briefly, but without any detail, that he thought most\n\nclinicians used the term \"children\" in this manner.\n\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\f           Dr. Bard reasoned that in describing pedophilia, the DSM\n\nspecifically refers to \"prepubescent\" children; but, if anything,\n\nthe explicit qualifier \"prepubescent\" used in defining pedophilia\n\nwould make one think that its omission in the phrase \"children and\n\nnonconsenting    persons\"    does    not       exclude   young    but   pubescent\n\nadolescents.    The idea that the reference to \"children\" in the\n\nopening examples of common fixations automatically and definitively\n\nexcludes molestation of young teenagers is far from compelling and,\n\nin any case, the \"not otherwise specified\" category remains.\n\n           So on this record it would be clear error to say that the\n\nDSM definition of paraphilia excluded an intense sexual fixation on\n\nyoung   teenagers    accompanied    by     a   pattern   of   conduct    such    as\n\nCarta's.   Nor did the district court squarely take this position;\n\ninstead, its main concern was one of indefiniteness and over-\n\ninclusion: the district judge said that paraphilia not otherwise\n\nspecified should not be stretched to include hebephilia because it\n\nwould thereby encompass anyone sexually aroused by post-pubescent\n\nminors, which given the vagueness of the term hebephilia \"could\n\npathologize normal men.\"      Carta, 620 F. Supp. 2d at 224.\n\n           Given that some teenagers are sexually mature, it is\n\nhardly surprising that the DSM (and the courts) would hesitate to\n\nclassify any and all sexual attraction to them as abnormal.                     But\n\nDr.   Phenix   did   not   claim    that       Carta's   mental   disorder      was\n\nhebephilia; she said it was paraphilia not otherwise specified, and\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fthe reference to hebephilia merely pointed to adolescents as the\n\ntarget of his fixation.       This does not mean that everyone sexually\n\nattracted to adolescents is mentally disordered; rather, it means\n\nthat one whose urges are so strong as to produce the symptoms and\n\nconsequences identified in the DSM and exhibited by Carta could be\n\nso classified in an appropriate case.\n\n          The cases cited by the district judge are not helpful to\n\nhis ruling.     In Shields, the trial court rejected hebephilia\n\nstanding alone as \"a serious mental illness, abnormality, or\n\ndisorder,\" but did not categorically reject the diagnosis of\n\nparaphilia not otherwise specified characterized by hebephilia;\n\ninstead, the district court said it lacked an adequate record to\n\nassess the latter diagnosis.       2008 WL 544940, at *2.       In Abregana,\n\nthe   court   found    that     paraphilia      not     otherwise    specified\n\ncharacterized   by    hebephilia   was     a   mental    disorder,   but   that\n\ndangerousness was not established.         574 F. Supp. 2d at 1154.\n\n          In sum, the government's position depended not on showing\n\nthat hebephilia is a mental disorder but on showing that Carta's\n\nsexual attraction to teenagers fell within the DSM definition of\n\nparaphilia not otherwise specified; Dr. Phenix provided ample\n\nreason to conclude that Carta fell within the DSM definition, and\n\nnothing in Dr. Bard's report shows why that conclusion is wrong.\n\nWe add only that it would be unlikely to take Carta outside the\n\nstatute even if we concluded improbably that he fell outside any\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\fDSM-recognized affliction; as already explained, the reach of\n\nsection 4248 is not limited to the specific conditions listed in\n\nthe DSM.\n\n            Dr. Bard's report does show that the experts disagree as\n\nto Carta's ability to control his sexual urges toward adolescents.\n\nThe government must prove by clear and convincing evidence not only\n\nthat Carta has the required mental condition, but also would have\n\n\"serious difficulty in refraining from sexually violent conduct or\n\nchild molestation if released.\"         18 U.S.C. § 4247(a)(6).        On the\n\nlatter   issue,   Dr.    Bard's    evaluation    favorable    to   Carta    is\n\nreasonably detailed and specific, but so is Dr. Phenix's contrary\n\nposition.     Whose     analysis   is   more   persuasive    remains   to   be\n\ndetermined on remand.\n\n            This brings us to Carta's claims that section 4248 is\n\nfacially unconstitutional because the statute is not a valid\n\nexercise of Congress' authority under the Commerce Clause and\n\nbecause it violates the Due Process Clause of the 5th Amendment and\n\nits encompassed equal protection requirement.           The Supreme Court\n\nhas taken under review United States v. Comstock, 551 F.3d 274 (4th\n\nCir. 2009), cert. granted, 129 S. Ct. 2828 (June 22, 2009), to\n\nresolve a circuit split over Congress' authority to enact section\n\n\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\f4248,       and   so   will    likely     resolve     a    portion    of   Carta's\n\nconstitutional claims.4\n\n              Because Carta is being held in custody after his now-\n\nexpired sentence, this court concluded that the appeal should be\n\nexpedited because affirmance of the district court ruling would\n\nhave expedited his release.               Given our disagreement with the\n\ndistrict court's ruling, we turn to the constitutional issues\n\nwhich,      if    disposed    of   in    Carta's    favor,    would   provide   an\n\nalternative       ground     for   his   release.     In     considering   Carta's\n\nconstitutional claims a de novo standard of review applies. United\n\nStates v. Rene E., 583 F.3d 8, 11 (1st Cir. 2009), cert. denied,\n\n2010 WL 58720 (Jan. 11, 2010).\n\n              In United States v. Volungus, No. 09-1596, 2010 WL 46968,\n\n(1st Cir. Jan. 8, 2010), we recently rejected the claim that\n\nsection 4248 exceeded Congress' power under the Commerce Clause,\n\nfinding that the constitutional power that supports the creation of\n\na federal crime extends, under the Necessary and Proper Clause, to\n\nsafeguarding the public against the release of an individual shown\n\nby clear and convincing evidence to remain a significant danger to\n\nthe public.       Id. at *1, 4-9.        On this issue, Carta's brief relied\n\n\n\n        4\n      The Fourth Circuit in Comstock held that section 4248\nexceeded Congress' authority and so was unconstitutional. 551 F.3d\nat 276. The Eighth Circuit also ruled on this issue but came out\nthe other way, finding that the statute was within Congress' power.\nUnited States v. Tom, 565 F.3d 497, 508 (8th Cir. 2009), petition\nfor cert. filed Aug. 6, 2009.\n\n                                         -15-\n\fsolely   on     Volungus'   briefing     and   the    Volungus      decision   is\n\ndispositive.\n\n              Carta's due process arguments are that the Constitution\n\ndemands that section 4248 commitment proceedings require a jury\n\ntrial, proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and additional prior notice\n\nand prompt hearing requirements.           But section 4248 imposes civil\n\ncommitment--Carta does not argue otherwise--and Addington v. Texas,\n\n441    U.S.    418,   427-33   (1979),    ruled      that   proof    of   future\n\ndangerousness in a civil commitment proceeding requires only clear\n\nand convincing evidence.       In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 368 (1970),\n\napplied a reasonable doubt requirement in a civil proceeding\n\nincarcerating a juvenile for delinquency, which the Court deemed\n\nessentially criminal; but Addington held that civil commitment can\n\n\"in no sense be equated to a criminal prosecution,\"                 441 U.S. at\n\n428.\n\n              It has been argued (we need not decide the issue) that at\n\nleast the criminal standard of proof should be used under section\n\n4248 to show the required past act of sexual violence or child\n\nmolestation where it is not embodied in a prior conviction. United\n\nStates v. Shields, 522 F. Supp. 2d 317, 331-32 (D. Mass. 2007).\n\nBut in this case Carta conceded prior acts of child molestation.\n\nEven if in other cases a higher standard were required, it could be\n\nread into the statute or unconstitutional applications enjoined so\n\n\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\fthat facial invalidation would be unwarranted.             See Ayotte v.\n\nPlanned Parenthood of N. New Eng., 546 U.S. 320, 328-29 (2006).\n\n              On Carta's jury trial claim, the Supreme Court declined\n\nto require a jury in juvenile delinquency proceedings, McKeiver v.\n\nPa., 403 U.S. 528, 547 (1971), and the claim to a jury trial right\n\nin civil commitments has been rejected under not only the Due\n\nProcess Clause, United States v. Sahhar, 917 F.2d 1197, 1206-07\n\n(9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 963 (1991), but also the\n\nSixth   and    Seventh   Amendments,   see   e.g.,   Hernandez-Carrera   v.\n\nCarlson, 547 F.3d 1237, 1256 (10th Cir. 2008), cert. denied, 2009\n\nWL 1982389 (Dec. 14, 2009); Poole v. Goodno, 335 F.3d 705, 710-11\n\n(8th Cir. 2003).      Carta cites virtually no law to the contrary.\n\n              Three other due process claims are made. One is that the\n\nkey components of section 4248--\"serious difficulty in refraining\n\nfrom sexually violent conduct\" resulting from a \"serious mental\n\nillness, abnormality, or disorder\"--are too vague to comport with\n\ndue process. But the criminal law itself is filled with equally\n\nimprecise terms (including fraud, insanity and defenses such as\n\nentrapment and duress).      These terms are sufficiently explicit to\n\ngive notice and prevent arbitrary enforcement, and the present\n\nstatute also passes muster.        See Peterson v. Gaughan, 404 F.2d\n\n1375, 1377 (1st Cir. 1968) (upholding similar state statute).\n\n              The second claim is based on the failure of section 4248\n\nto specify that a prompt hearing is required and perhaps--whether\n\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\fthis   is   requisite     is   more   debatable--to     impose   some   prompt\n\npreliminary screening by a neutral magistrate before a substantial\n\nperiod of detention occurs after the sentence has expired.                 We\n\ncannot say that violations are so likely as to meet the high\n\nstandard needed to facially invalidate the statute, McCullen v.\n\nCoakley, 571 F.3d 167, 174 (1st Cir. 2009), and in any event those\n\ndefects     could   be   remedied     by    interpolating   requirements   and\n\nremedies where the individual's hearing has been inordinately\n\ndelayed, see Ayotte, 546 U.S. at 328-29; see also Shields, 522 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 336-37.       Carta has now had his hearing, did not bring\n\nan as-applied challenge against the timing of his hearings and does\n\nnot on appeal claim prejudice in his ability to present his case.\n\n             This does not excuse what may be a pattern in which the\n\ngovernment certifies prisoners as sexually dangerous mere days\n\nbefore their scheduled release, thereby guaranteeing that they will\n\nbe held for an extended period beyond that date even if there is\n\nlittle basis for the charge.               Any such practice is a result of\n\nimproper administration, not statutory command.               The government\n\ndeserves fair warning and a modest additional period to frame the\n\nnecessary regulations limiting the period of detention without a\n\nhearing; after that, it is likely to find courts imposing remedies.\n\n             Carta's third claim is that section 4248 does not provide\n\nadequate notice of the proposed basis of commitment.             Section 4248\n\nrequires a responsible government official to provide a certificate\n\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\fthat the target is a \"sexually dangerous person\" to both the\n\ndistrict    court   and   the    target.     18   U.S.C.   §   4248(a).        The\n\ncertificate in Carta's case described some of Carta's past acts of\n\nchild molestation, listed his mental diagnoses and summarized the\n\nbases for thinking that he would be dangerous in the future; Carta\n\nfails to explain why such a notice is constitutionally inadequate.\n\n            Carta's equal protection argument is that section 4248\n\nfails rational basis review because the class of individuals\n\npotentially affected by the statute--namely, all federal prisoners-\n\n-does not bear a rational relationship to the government purpose of\n\nincapacitating      \"sexually      dangerous\"     individuals.     The     equal\n\nprotection argument builds on Baxstrom v. Herald, 383 U.S. 107\n\n(1966), where the Supreme Court disallowed a state commitment\n\nstatute that made it easier to commit based on mental illness those\n\nalready    in   prison    than    counterpart     state    residents     not    so\n\nimprisoned.     Id. at 110-11.\n\n            But a state, unlike            Congress, has a general police\n\npower, whereas the federal government's interest and responsibility\n\nhere stem from the fact that it already has custody of the\n\nprisoner.       Volungus,   2010    WL   46968,   at   *6-7.     There    is    no\n\ncorresponding group of unimprisoned persons subject to its police\n\npower, so with respect to the operation of section 4248, federal\n\nprisoners and unimprisoned persons are not similarly situated. See\n\nPlyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 216 (1982).               Thus, far from being\n\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\firrational, it is inevitable that the federal government limits the\n\nreach of section 4248 to individuals already in its custody.\n\n           We uphold the district court's determination that the\n\nstatute   is   not   facially   unconstitutional,   conclude   that   the\n\ndistrict court erred in holding that the government failed to\n\nestablish that Carta met the mental condition element and remand\n\nfor it to consider whether the requisite dangerousness exists.\n\n           It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                     --Concurring Opinion Follows--\n\n\n\n\n                                   -20-\n\f          LAPLANTE, District Judge, concurring. As explained in my\n\nrecent dissent in United States v. Volungus, No. 09-1596, 2010 WL\n\n46968, at *9 (1st Cir. Jan. 8, 2010), I have serious concerns about\n\nwhether the Walsh Act is necessary and proper to the exercise of\n\nCongress’s enumerated powers.   Since the Supreme Court has already\n\nheard oral argument in a case that raises that very issue, see\n\nUnited States v. Comstock, 551 F.3d 274 (4th Cir. 2009), cert.\n\ngranted, 129 S. Ct. 2828 (2009), I would prefer to wait for the\n\nSupreme Court’s ruling rather than remand this case now and create\n\npotentially unnecessary work for the district court.    Carta will\n\nremain in federal custody either way, at least in the short term.\n\n          Notwithstanding this preference, I concur fully in the\n\nmajority opinion because I recognize that Volungus, which upheld\n\nthe Walsh Act as a valid exercise of Congress’s authority, is now\n\nthe established law of this circuit.\n\n\n\n\n                                -21-\n\f",

The federal government sought to\n\ncommit Todd Carta under the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety\n\nAct, Pub L. No. 109-248, 120 Stat. 587 (2006) (\"Adam Walsh Act\").\n\nThat statute authorizes civil commitment of a person already in\n\nfederal   custody,   including   one   finishing   a   sentence   after   a\n\ncriminal conviction, if the government shows that he is a \"sexually\n\ndangerous person.\"    18 U.S.C. § 4248 (2006).         The district court\n\nheld that the government failed to make the necessary showing; the\n\ngovernment now appeals, and Carta cross-appeals claiming that the\n\nstatute is unconstitutional.\n\n           After pleading guilty to child pornography charges in\n\nOctober 2002, Carta was sentenced to five years in federal prison\n\nand three years of supervised release.      Three years into his term,\n\nCarta requested and was granted a transfer to a federal prison in\n\nNorth Carolina offering a sex offender treatment program.           Carta\n\nparticipated in the program for approximately seven months, but\n\nthen withdrew without completing the program.\n\n           Carta's treating psychologist noted that even within the\n\nprogram, he exhibited problematic behavior: reinforcing the deviant\n\nbeliefs of others in the program, denying that his behavior was\n\ninappropriate and acting impulsively.       Further, Carta dropped out\n\nof the program partly because of his inability to curb his sexual\n\ninterest the program's younger participants, which resulted in\n\nrestrictions being imposed on his contact with them.\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\f          In the course of the program, Carta disclosed details of\n\nhis sexual and criminal history that prompted the government's\n\ninvocation of the Adam Walsh Act's commitment procedures (in\n\nshorthand, \"section 4248\").      Carta described his primary sexual\n\ninterest as children age 12 to 17 and his secondary interest as\n\nchildren age 7 to 11, and admitted to having a large child\n\npornography collection; he usually stored between 10,000 and 20,000\n\nimages on his computer and spent 12 to 14 hours daily looking at\n\nchild pornography prior to his arrest.\n\n          Carta further admitted to sexually abusing minors on many\n\noccasions, with his youngest victim being a child in diapers.\n\nCarta's long history of sexually abusing minors is detailed in the\n\ndistrict court opinion, United States v.

Experts testified on both sides.\n\nThe government expert, Dr. Amy Phenix, testified that, based on\n\nrisk factors such as age, frequency of misconduct and lack of\n\nsuccess in treatment, Carta would have serious difficulty in\n\nrefraining from child molestation if released.1                    Dr. Phenix said\n\nthat Carta suffered from a mental disorder known as \"paraphilia not\n\notherwise specified\" that was characterized by \"hebephilia.\"\n\n               Paraphilia     is   characterized        by   the   Diagnostic    and\n\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders (\"DSM\"), a commonly used\n\nreference book in the fields of psychiatry and psychology, as\n\nfollows:\n\n               The essential features of a Paraphilia are\n               recurrent,    intense    sexually   arousing\n               fantasies,   sexual   urges,   or  behaviors\n               generally involving 1) nonhuman objects, 2)\n               the suffering or humiliation of oneself or\n               one's partner, or 3) children or other\n               nonconsenting persons, that occur over a\n               period of at least 6 months . . . [and that]\n\n\n        1\n      Dr. Phenix's report, like the report of Carta's expert Dr.\nLeonard Bard, is under seal; but we note that her diagnosis and\nevaluation of dangerousness did not rest simply on Carta's\nconfession of past incidents but also on his behavior in prison,\nhis statements about his present feelings and a set of standardized\nevaluative   measurements    based    primarily   on    correlating\ncharacteristics of the individual with statistical data about re-\noffense.\n\n                                           -5-\n\f            cause clinically significant distress or\n            impairment in social, occupational, or other\n            important areas of functioning . . . .\n\nAm.   Psychiatric   Ass'n,      DSM    522-23    (4th    ed.    2000).     Carta's\n\ncondition was described by Dr. Phenix as paraphilia not otherwise\n\nspecified    because    hebephilia--loosely,            sexual    attraction     to\n\nadolescents, Carta, 620 F. Supp. 2d at 217--is not itself an\n\nabnormality specifically listed in the DSM nor is it one of the\n\nspecific examples of paraphilia listed in the DSM.                  By contrast,\n\npedophilia, sexual attraction to children before puberty, is a\n\nlisted variety of paraphilia in the DSM.                DSM, supra, at 527-28.\n\n            Dr. Bard, an expert designated at Carta's request, see 18\n\nU.S.C. § 4247(b), conceded that Carta suffered from \"numerous\n\nproblems\" but--based in part on Dr. Bard's own test results--\n\nconcluded    that   Carta    would     not   have       serious    difficulty     in\n\nrefraining from child molestation if released.                     Dr. Bard also\n\nasserted that hebephilia was not a generally accepted diagnosis in\n\nthe mental health community, did not fit within the DSM definition\n\nof    paraphilia,   lacked   diagnostic         criteria    and    could   not    be\n\nconsistently defined; that normal adults may find adolescents\n\narousing; and that articles offered by the government to support a\n\nhebephilia diagnosis were not legitimate peer-reviewed research.\n\n            In   June   2009,    the    district        court    ruled   that    the\n\ngovernment had not proved by clear and convincing evidence that\n\nCarta was a \"sexually dangerous person\" within the meaning of the\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fAdam Walsh Act.        Carta, 620 F. Supp. 2d at 226-27.               Relying on Dr.\n\nBard's    reasoning,         the   district       court    concluded    that   Carta's\n\ndiagnosis of paraphilia not otherwise specified characterized by\n\nhebephilia was not a \"serious mental illness, abnormality, or\n\ndisorder\" under the statute.                Id. at 222-27.          Because having a\n\ndefined mental condition is a prerequisite for commitment under\n\nsection 4248, the court did not reach the separate question of\n\nwhether    Carta     would     have    serious       difficulty     refraining   from\n\nmolestation if released.             Id. at 229.          We stayed Carta's release\n\npending the government's expedited appeal.\n\n              Chapter 313 of the Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C. §§ 4241-4248,\n\naddresses competency to stand trial, disposition of those found not\n\nguilty by reason of insanity and treatment of those in custody who\n\nare found to be suffering from a mental disease or defect.                          One\n\nprovision authorizes, and provides procedures for, id. §§ 4246(a)-\n\n(g), continued commitment of individuals in federal custody--\n\notherwise      due     for     release--where        release      would   \"create     a\n\nsubstantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious\n\ndamage to property of another\" by reason of a \"mental disease or\n\ndefect,\" id. § 4246(a).\n\n              Appended, with cross-references to the basic scheme, is\n\na   section    added    by     the   Adam    Walsh    Act    that   addresses    civil\n\ncommitment of \"a sexually dangerous person\" who is in the custody\n\nof the Attorney General or Bureau of Prisons; commitment may\n\n\n                                            -7-\n\fcontinue until that person is transferred to state care or \"is no\n\nlonger sexually dangerous to others\" or until that danger can be\n\ncontrolled by outpatient care and treatment. 18 U.S.C. §§ 4248(a),\n\n(d).   \"Sexually dangerous person\" and \"sexually dangerous to\n\nothers\" are defined, and the former includes the requirements of\n\nthe latter. Id. §§ 4247(a)(5),(6). The combination requires three\n\nelements:\n\n            a prior act (or attempted act) of \"violent\n            sexual conduct or child molestation\";\n\n            \"a serious mental illness, abnormality, or\n            disorder\"; and\n\n            a resulting \"serious difficulty in refraining\n            from sexually violent conduct or child\n            molestation if released.\"\n\n            Carta   does   not   deny   that   he   has   engaged   in    child\n\nmolestation in the past, and the district judge so found.                Carta,\n\n620 F. Supp. 2d at 221-22.         Thus, whether the government could\n\ncommit Carta turned on whether he suffered from \"a serious mental\n\nillness, abnormality, or disorder\" and whether he would have\n\n\"serious difficulty\" in refraining from further child molestation.\n\nAs already noted, the district judge did not reach the latter\n\nquestion because he ruled the government had failed to show that\n\nCarta suffered from the necessary mental condition.\n\n            On review, we distinguish between what the statute means,\n\nquestions of raw fact and the intermediate step of characterizing\n\nthe raw facts in the terms of the statute thus defined.

Carta, 620 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 223-24.        The court also considered whether classing\n\nhebephilia as a mental disorder was \"supported by research in the\n\nfield of psychology\" and whether it was \"generally accepted in the\n\npsychiatric and psychological community,\" finding that although\n\nthere is some dispute in the field, hebephilia is \"not generally\n\nrecognized as a serious mental illness.\"           Id. at 225-26.\n\n            The problem with the district court's approach is that\n\nparaphilia is expressly a DSM-listed disorder and Carta appears to\n\nfall within this category.        The \"essential features\" of paraphilia\n\nare \"recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges,\n\nor behaviors\" fixated on a specific \"stimuli,\" which \"occur over a\n\nperiod of at least 6 months\" and \"cause clinically significant\n\ndistress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important\n\nareas of functioning.\"      DSM, supra, at 522-23.

At first blush, one might think that\n\na number of those abused by Carta fall easily within the category\n\nof \"children or other nonconsenting persons.\"\n\n          But in any case the DSM includes a catch-all category\n\ncalled \"paraphilia not otherwise specified\" that lists, simply as\n\nexamples, types of paraphilia, such as fixation on obscene phone\n\ncalls, specific body parts, feces or urine.     DSM, supra, at 532.\n\nBased on Dr. Phenix's report, Carta's past history of sexually\n\nabusing minors, his in-prison behavior and his expressed attitudes\n\nseemingly justify classifying him as suffering from a paraphilia:\n\nhe has a decades-long sexual fixation on minors that plainly has\n\n\"caused significant distress or impairment\" in his life.\n\n          With one exception, nothing in Dr. Bard's report appears\n\ndirectly to contradict this classification.    The exception--which\n\nthe district judge noted but did not expressly adopt, see Carta,\n\n620 F. Supp. 2d at 223--is this: in his testimony (rather than his\n\nreport), Dr. Bard took the position that the term \"children\" in the\n\nphrase \"children or other nonconsenting persons,\" which the DSM\n\nuses as an example of a common category of fixations that often\n\nunderlie paraphilia, refers only to prepubescent children. He also\n\nstated briefly, but without any detail, that he thought most\n\nclinicians used the term \"children\" in this manner.\n\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\f           Dr. Bard reasoned that in describing pedophilia, the DSM\n\nspecifically refers to \"prepubescent\" children; but, if anything,\n\nthe explicit qualifier \"prepubescent\" used in defining pedophilia\n\nwould make one think that its omission in the phrase \"children and\n\nnonconsenting    persons\"    does    not       exclude   young    but   pubescent\n\nadolescents.    The idea that the reference to \"children\" in the\n\nopening examples of common fixations automatically and definitively\n\nexcludes molestation of young teenagers is far from compelling and,\n\nin any case, the \"not otherwise specified\" category remains.\n\n           So on this record it would be clear error to say that the\n\nDSM definition of paraphilia excluded an intense sexual fixation on\n\nyoung   teenagers    accompanied    by     a   pattern   of   conduct    such    as\n\nCarta's.   Nor did the district court squarely take this position;\n\ninstead, its main concern was one of indefiniteness and over-\n\ninclusion: the district judge said that paraphilia not otherwise\n\nspecified should not be stretched to include hebephilia because it\n\nwould thereby encompass anyone sexually aroused by post-pubescent\n\nminors, which given the vagueness of the term hebephilia \"could\n\npathologize normal men.\"      Carta, 620 F. Supp. 2d at 224.\n\n           Given that some teenagers are sexually mature, it is\n\nhardly surprising that the DSM (and the courts) would hesitate to\n\nclassify any and all sexual attraction to them as abnormal.                     But\n\nDr.   Phenix   did   not   claim    that       Carta's   mental   disorder      was\n\nhebephilia; she said it was paraphilia not otherwise specified, and\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fthe reference to hebephilia merely pointed to adolescents as the\n\ntarget of his fixation.       This does not mean that everyone sexually\n\nattracted to adolescents is mentally disordered; rather, it means\n\nthat one whose urges are so strong as to produce the symptoms and\n\nconsequences identified in the DSM and exhibited by Carta could be\n\nso classified in an appropriate case.\n\n          The cases cited by the district judge are not helpful to\n\nhis ruling.     In Shields, the trial court rejected hebephilia\n\nstanding alone as \"a serious mental illness, abnormality, or\n\ndisorder,\" but did not categorically reject the diagnosis of\n\nparaphilia not otherwise specified characterized by hebephilia;\n\ninstead, the district court said it lacked an adequate record to\n\nassess the latter diagnosis.       </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">544940</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2.       In Abregana,\n\nthe   court   found    that     paraphilia      not     otherwise    specified\n\ncharacterized   by    hebephilia   was     a   mental    disorder,   but   that\n\ndangerousness was not established.         574 F. Supp. 2d at 1154.\n\n          In sum, the government's position depended not on showing\n\nthat hebephilia is a mental disorder but on showing that Carta's\n\nsexual attraction to teenagers fell within the DSM definition of\n\nparaphilia not otherwise specified; Dr. Phenix provided ample\n\nreason to conclude that Carta fell within the DSM definition, and\n\nnothing in Dr. Bard's report shows why that conclusion is wrong.\n\nWe add only that it would be unlikely to take Carta outside the\n\nstatute even if we concluded improbably that he fell outside any\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\fDSM-recognized affliction; as already explained, the reach of\n\nsection 4248 is not limited to the specific conditions listed in\n\nthe DSM.\n\n            Dr. Bard's report does show that the experts disagree as\n\nto Carta's ability to control his sexual urges toward adolescents.\n\nThe government must prove by clear and convincing evidence not only\n\nthat Carta has the required mental condition, but also would have\n\n\"serious difficulty in refraining from sexually violent conduct or\n\nchild molestation if released.\"         18 U.S.C. § 4247(a)(6).        On the\n\nlatter   issue,   Dr.    Bard's    evaluation    favorable    to   Carta    is\n\nreasonably detailed and specific, but so is Dr. Phenix's contrary\n\nposition.     Whose     analysis   is   more   persuasive    remains   to   be\n\ndetermined on remand.\n\n            This brings us to Carta's claims that section 4248 is\n\nfacially unconstitutional because the statute is not a valid\n\nexercise of Congress' authority under the Commerce Clause and\n\nbecause it violates the Due Process Clause of the 5th Amendment and\n\nits encompassed equal protection requirement.

Carta cites virtually no law to the contrary.\n\n              Three other due process claims are made. One is that the\n\nkey components of section 4248--\"serious difficulty in refraining\n\nfrom sexually violent conduct\" resulting from a \"serious mental\n\nillness, abnormality, or disorder\"--are too vague to comport with\n\ndue process. But the criminal law itself is filled with equally\n\nimprecise terms (including fraud, insanity and defenses such as\n\nentrapment and duress).      These terms are sufficiently explicit to\n\ngive notice and prevent arbitrary enforcement, and the present\n\nstatute also passes muster.        See Peterson v. Gaughan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"282828\"><a href=\"/opinion/282828/leroy-j-peterson-v-charles-w-gaughan-superintendent-massachusetts/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1375</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1377 (1st Cir. 1968) (upholding similar state statute).\n\n              The second claim is based on the failure of section 4248\n\nto specify that a prompt hearing is required and perhaps--whether\n\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\fthis   is   requisite     is   more   debatable--to     impose   some   prompt\n\npreliminary screening by a neutral magistrate before a substantial\n\nperiod of detention occurs after the sentence has expired.                 We\n\ncannot say that violations are so likely as to meet the high\n\nstandard needed to facially invalidate the statute, McCullen v.\n\nCoakley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203907\"><a href=\"/opinion/203907/mccullen-v-coakley/\"><span class=\"volume\">571</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 174 (1st Cir. 2009), and in any event those\n\ndefects     could   be   remedied     by    interpolating   requirements   and\n\nremedies where the individual's hearing has been inordinately\n\ndelayed, see Ayotte, 546 U.S. at 328-29; see also Shields, 522 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 336-37.       Carta has now had his hearing, did not bring\n\nan as-applied challenge against the timing of his hearings and does\n\nnot on appeal claim prejudice in his ability to present his case.\n\n             This does not excuse what may be a pattern in which the\n\ngovernment certifies prisoners as sexually dangerous mere days\n\nbefore their scheduled release, thereby guaranteeing that they will\n\nbe held for an extended period beyond that date even if there is\n\nlittle basis for the charge.               Any such practice is a result of\n\nimproper administration, not statutory command.               The government\n\ndeserves fair warning and a modest additional period to frame the\n\nnecessary regulations limiting the period of detention without a\n\nhearing; after that, it is likely to find courts imposing remedies.\n\n             Carta's third claim is that section 4248 does not provide\n\nadequate notice of the proposed basis of commitment.             Section 4248\n\nrequires a responsible government official to provide a certificate\n\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\fthat the target is a \"sexually dangerous person\" to both the\n\ndistrict    court   and   the    target.     18   U.S.C.   §   4248(a).        The\n\ncertificate in Carta's case described some of Carta's past acts of\n\nchild molestation, listed his mental diagnoses and summarized the\n\nbases for thinking that he would be dangerous in the future; Carta\n\nfails to explain why such a notice is constitutionally inadequate.\n\n            Carta's equal protection argument is that section 4248\n\nfails rational basis review because the class of individuals\n\npotentially affected by the statute--namely, all federal prisoners-\n\n-does not bear a rational relationship to the government purpose of\n\nincapacitating      \"sexually      dangerous\"     individuals.     The     equal\n\nprotection argument builds on Baxstrom v. Herald, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107165\"><a href=\"/opinion/107165/baxstrom-v-herold/\"><span class=\"volume\">383</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(1966), where the Supreme Court disallowed a state commitment\n\nstatute that made it easier to commit based on mental illness those\n\nalready    in   prison    than    counterpart     state    residents     not    so\n\nimprisoned.     Id. at 110-11.\n\n            But a state, unlike            Congress, has a general police\n\npower, whereas the federal government's interest and responsibility\n\nhere stem from the fact that it already has custody of the\n\nprisoner.

There    is    no\n\ncorresponding group of unimprisoned persons subject to its police\n\npower, so with respect to the operation of section 4248, federal\n\nprisoners and unimprisoned persons are not similarly situated.
