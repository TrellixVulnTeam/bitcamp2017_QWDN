On    March    23,    2004,    the\n\ndistrict    court     issued       an   order      dismissing     defendant-appellant\n\nMelissa Jo Cordle's habeas corpus petition for being time-barred\n\nunder the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n\n(\"AEDPA\"), 28 U.S.C. § 2244.                 On September 1, 2004, the district\n\ncourt granted a certificate of appealability on the issue of\n\n\"whether,       in   the   circumstances           of   [Cordle's]      case,   the     time\n\nlimitations of the AEDPA should be equitably tolled.\"                           Answering\n\nthat question in the negative, we affirm.\n\n                                              I.\n\n            On April 24, 1986, a Barnstable County Superior Court\n\njury convicted Cordle of two counts of first-degree murder and one\n\ncount of burglary.          Cordle appealed directly to the Massachusetts\n\nSupreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\") pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 278,\n\n§ 33E, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support the\n\nverdict and that the trial judge gave erroneous jury instructions.\n\nOn April 26, 1989, the SJC found that the evidence was sufficient\n\nto support the jury's verdict but reversed Cordle's conviction due\n\nto   an   error      in    the    trial      judge's     jury   instructions.1           See\n\nCommonwealth v. Cordle, 537 N.E.2d 130 (Mass. 1989)(\"Cordle I\").\n\nCordle    was    re-tried,        and   on    August     19,    1989,    she    was   again\n\nconvicted of two counts of first-degree murder and one count of\n\n\n\n1\n   One of the justices dissented, arguing that the evidence was\ninsufficient to support the verdict.\n\n                                             -2-\n\fburglary.2    Cordle appealed her conviction directly to the SJC and\n\nagain argued that the evidence was insufficient to support her\n\nconviction and that the trial judge's jury instructions allowed her\n\nto be convicted without proof beyond a reasonable doubt as to each\n\nand every element of the offenses of which she was charged.      The\n\nSJC affirmed on March 11, 1992.      See Commonwealth v. Cordle, 587\n\nN.E.2d 1372 (Mass. 1992)(\"Cordle II\").3\n\n             On November 11, 2000, Cordle, who was represented by new\n\ncounsel, filed a motion for a new trial.    This motion was denied on\n\nDecember 18, 2000.    Cordle appealed to a Single Justice Session of\n\nthe SJC, and on December 4, 2001, a single justice denied Cordle's\n\npetition.      On December 3, 2002, Cordle filed a habeas corpus\n\npetition in the United States District Court for the District of\n\nMassachusetts.     On September 25, 2003, a United States Magistrate\n\nJudge recommended that Cordle's petition be dismissed because it\n\nwas time-barred.     On March 23, 2004, the district court followed\n\nthis recommendation and issued an order dismissing the petition as\n\ntime-barred.\n\n\n2\n    At the second trial the prosecution presented additional\nevidence of a threat that Cordle had made regarding one of the two\nvictims.\n3\n  In Cordle II, the justice who had dissented in Cordle I authored\nthe opinion affirming Cordle's convictions. In the opinion, the\njustice stated that he \"acced[ed] to the precedent established in\nCordle I regarding the sufficiency of the evidence; additionally,\n. . . the additional evidence of a specific threat to kill the\nvictims is more significant than the threats relied on by the court\nin Cordle I.\" Cordle II, 587 N.E.2d at 1374 n.2.\n\n                                  -3-\n\f                                  II.\n\n          We   review   the   district   court's   decision   regarding\n\nequitable tolling in this habeas case for abuse of discretion.\n\nNeverson v. Farquharson, 366 F.3d 32, 42 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n          AEDPA, which was enacted on April 24, 1996, provides that\n\n\"[a] 1-year period of limitation shall apply to an application for\n\na writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the\n\njudgment of a State court.\"        28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1).        While\n\n\"AEDPA's one-year limit runs from the time that the state court\n\njudgment of conviction became final[,] . . . defendants . . .\n\nconvicted prior to AEDPA[] can file their petitions within one year\n\nof AEDPA's effective date.\"    David v. Hall, 318 F.3d 343, 344 (1st\n\nCir. 2003) (internal citation omitted).     The SJC affirmed Cordle's\n\nconvictions on March 11, 1992; her convictions became final ninety\n\ndays thereafter.   See Neverson, 366 F.3d at 36 (stating that a\n\ndefendant's \"conviction became final when the ninety-day period for\n\nseeking certiorari expired\").     Because this date was before the\n\nenactment of AEDPA, Cordle had one year from April 24, 1996 to file\n\na petition for habeas corpus.    Thus, absent any tolling, the one-\n\nyear period ended on April 24, 1997.4\n\n\n4\n   In her brief, Cordle implies that AEDPA's one-year period of\nlimitations did not begin to run until the SJC denied her motion\nfor a new trial on December 4, 2001. Under 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(2),\n\"the time during which a properly filed application for State post-\nconviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent\njudgment or claim is pending shall not be counted\" toward the one-\nyear limitations period. However, Cordle's motion for a new trial\n\n                                  -4-\n\f            We have held that the one-year limitations period in\n\n§ 2244(d)(1) may be equitably tolled.                See Neverson, 366 F.3d at\n\n41.     \"[E]quitable tolling . . . is the exception rather than the\n\nrule;    resort    to   its    prophylaxis      is   deemed     justified    only   in\n\nextraordinary circumstances.\"            Delaney v. Matesanz, 264 F.3d 7, 14\n\n(1st Cir. 2001).        \"It is reserved for cases in which circumstances\n\nbeyond the litigant's control have prevented [her] from promptly\n\nfiling.\"     Lattimore v. Dubois, 311 F.3d 46, 55 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\nCordle bears the burden of establishing a basis for equitable\n\ntolling.    Id.\n\n            Cordle's first argument for equitable tolling is that the\n\nattorney    who     represented    her    at    trial     was    \"constitutionally\n\nineffective\" in not filing a petition for habeas corpus or advising\n\nher of any filing deadlines for a habeas petition.                   As this court\n\nand other courts of appeals have explained, counsel's errors in\n\ncalculating       the   time   limits    or    advising   a     petitioner    of    the\n\nappropriate       filing   deadlines     do    not    constitute     extraordinary\n\ncircumstances warranting equitable tolling.                See, e.g., David, 318\n\nF.3d at 346; Howell v. Crosby, 415 F.3d 1250, 1252 (11th Cir. 2005)\n\n\nwas not filed until November 11, 2000, several years after her\nAEDPA limitations period had already expired. \"Section 2244(d)(2)\nonly stops, but does not reset, the [AEDPA] clock from ticking and\ncannot revive a time period that has already expired.\" Dunker v.\nBissonnette, 154 F. Supp. 2d 95, 103 (D. Mass. 2001) (internal\nquotation marks, brackets, and ellipsis omitted). Because Cordle's\nmotion for a new trial was filed well after her AEDPA's limitations\nperiod had expired, it did not stop or reset the clock and does not\nhelp Cordle on this appeal.\n\n                                         -5-\n\f(stating that \"attorney negligence is not a basis for equitable\n\ntolling, especially when the petitioner cannot establish his own\n\ndiligence in ascertaining the federal habeas filing deadline\");\n\nHarris v. Hutchinson, 209 F.3d 325, 330 (4th Cir. 2000) (equitable\n\ntolling not warranted where counsel erroneously advised petitioner\n\nof the filing deadline due to a misreading of the statute); Dunker\n\nv. Bissonnette, 154 F. Supp. 2d 95, 107 (D. Mass. 2001) (stating\n\nthat usually, attorney errors are attributed to their clients).\n\n          In   the   instant   case,    Cordle   has   not   shown   how   her\n\nattorney's failure to file a habeas petition constituted anything\n\nmore than excusable neglect.     See David, 318 F.3d at 346.         This is\n\nnot a case where Cordle asked her counsel to file a habeas petition\n\nbut counsel failed to do so.           See, e.g., Baldayaque v. United\n\nStates, 338 F.3d 145, 152 (2d Cir. 2003) (finding equitable tolling\n\nappropriate where the petitioner's counsel failed to file a habeas\n\npetition despite being told to do so).           Further, Cordle has not\n\npresented any evidence tending to show that she was diligent in\n\npursuing her rights.     See Neverson, 366 F.3d at 42 (stating that\n\nequitable tolling is \"not available to rescue a litigant from [her]\n\nown lack of due diligence\").     As the government notes, Cordle did\n\nnot take any action regarding her convictions until November 11,\n\n2000 when she filed a motion for a new trial.          This was over eight\n\nyears after her conviction became final and over three years after\n\nAEDPA's one-year period of limitations had expired.            While Cordle\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fargues    that   she   lacked   knowledge   of    the    law    and   the   filing\n\ndeadline, it is well settled in this circuit that \"[i]gnorance of\n\nthe law alone, even for incarcerated pro se prisoners, does not\n\nexcuse an untimely [habeas] filing.\"             Lattimore, 311 F.3d at 55.\n\nIn the same way, Cordle's ignorance does not excuse her untimely\n\nhabeas petition.       Because any error by Cordle's attorney did not\n\nconstitute   extraordinary      circumstances      and   because      Cordle   has\n\nfailed to present any evidence showing that she was diligent in\n\npursuing her rights, we reject her argument that the limitations\n\nperiod should be equitably tolled due to her counsel's failures to\n\ninform her of her right to file a habeas petition and to timely\n\nfile a habeas petition.\n\n            Cordle next argues that the limitations period should be\n\nequitably tolled because she has not previously had federal review\n\nof her state convictions.       This argument is easily disposed of, as\n\nthe fact that this is Cordle's first habeas petition has no bearing\n\nin our consideration of whether any extraordinary circumstances\n\nexist that warrant equitable tolling.\n\n            Cordle's    final   argument    is    that    the    state      court's\n\nresolution of her claims constituted an unreasonable application of\n\nclearly    established     federal    law   because       the     evidence     was\n\ninsufficient to support the verdict and because the trial judge's\n\njury instructions were constitutionally deficient.                We agree with\n\nthe government that these arguments go to the merits of the habeas\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fpetition.      They do not play a role in whether extraordinary\n\ncircumstances    prevented   Cordle   from   timely   filing   a   habeas\n\npetition.\n\n            In sum, Cordle had almost five years from the time that\n\nher convictions became final to the time that her AEDPA limitations\n\nperiod expired in which to file a habeas petition.       She failed to\n\ndo so and has not made any showing that this failure was due to\n\nextraordinary circumstances or circumstances beyond her control.\n\nShe has also failed to present any evidence tending to show that\n\nshe was diligent in pursuing her federal rights before AEDPA's\n\nlimitations period expired.       We therefore hold that equitable\n\ntolling was not warranted in Cordle's case and that her habeas\n\npetition is time-barred.\n\n                                 III.\n\n            For the foregoing reasons, the district court's decision\n\nis affirmed.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\f",

This was over eight years after her conviction became final and over three years after AEDPA's one-year period of limitations had expired. While Cordle argues that she lacked knowledge of the law and the filing deadline, it is well settled in this circuit that \"[i]gnorance of the law alone, even for incarcerated <i>pro se</i> prisoners, does not excuse an untimely [habeas] filing.\" <i>Lattimore,</i> 311 F.3d at 55. In the same way, Cordle's ignorance does not excuse her untimely habeas petition. Because any error by Cordle's attorney did not constitute extraordinary circumstances and because Cordle has failed to present any evidence showing that she was diligent in pursuing her rights, we reject her argument that the limitations period should be equitably tolled due to her counsel's failures to inform her of her right to file a habeas petition and to timely file a habeas petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cordle next argues that the limitations period should be equitably tolled because she has not previously had federal review of her state convictions.

She failed to do so and has not made any showing that this failure was due to extraordinary circumstances or circumstances beyond her control. She has also failed to present any evidence tending to show that she was diligent in pursuing her federal rights before AEDPA's limitations period expired.

On April 26, 1989, the SJC found that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's verdict but reversed Cordle's conviction due to an error in the trial judge's jury instructions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> <i>See Commonwealth v.

On December 3, 2002, Cordle filed a habeas corpus petition in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. On September 25, 2003, a United States Magistrate Judge recommended that Cordle's petition be dismissed because it was time-barred.

Because this date was before the enactment of AEDPA, Cordle had one year from April 24, 1996 to file a petition for habeas corpus.
