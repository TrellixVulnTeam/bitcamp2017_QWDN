Indianapolis Life Insurance Co. brought a\n\ndiversity action against Rosalind Herman, in her capacity as\n\ntrustee of Financial Resources Network, Inc. Profit Sharing Plan\n\nand Trust, Financial Resources Network, Inc. Profit Sharing Plan\n\nand Trust, Gregg D.

The Meiselmans also brought\n\na cross-claim against the FRN defendants stemming from a soured\n\nemployment    relationship     between    Rudy      Meiselman    and    Financial\n\nResources Network.\n\n            The district court granted Indianapolis Life summary\n\njudgment,     ruling   that,   because        the   defendants   had    made   an\n\nintentional     misrepresentation        in     applying   for    the     policy,\n\nIndianapolis Life had properly rescinded it and was entitled to a\n\nreturn of the commission.          The court also entered a default\n\njudgment against the FRN defendants on the cross-claim, which was\n\nnever answered.    The FRN defendants appeal, arguing that disputed\n\nissues of material fact should have precluded the entry of summary\n\njudgment for Indianapolis Life, and that the district court should\n\nhave granted their motion to set aside the default judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f            Because      we   write   primarily       for   the   benefit     of   the\n\nparties,    we   omit    a    recitation   of    the   background      and    proceed\n\ndirectly to the merits of the district court's rulings.                      We begin\n\nby considering de novo the grant of summary judgment in favor of\n\nIndianapolis Life. See Fraidowitz v. Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co., 443\n\nF.3d 128, 131 (1st Cir. 2006). Under Massachusetts law, an insurer\n\nmay rescind an insurance policy by showing that the insured made a\n\nmisrepresentation in the negotiation of the policy \"with [the]\n\nactual     intent       to    deceive\"     the     insurer,       or    that       the\n\nmisrepresentation \"increased [the insurer's] risk of loss.\"                     Mass.\n\nGen. Laws ch. 175,       ยง 86.    Rescission is permissible if the insurer\n\nestablishes either an actual intent to deceive or an increased risk\n\nof loss.    See Boston Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. N.Y. Islanders Hockey\n\nClub, 165 F.3d      93, 96 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n            It is undisputed that Indianapolis Life required the\n\ndefendants to submit a statement of the Meiselmans' financial\n\ncondition prepared by a certified public accountant (CPA) as part\n\nof the underwriting process.           Caplitz provided Indianapolis Life\n\nwith an income verification statement for the Meiselmans purporting\n\nto   be   from   CPA    James    Goodness.       At    Caplitz's    request,       the\n\nverification statement was in fact prepared by James Goodness' son,\n\nDaniel, who was not a CPA.         Caplitz asked Daniel Goodness to place\n\nthe verification statement on his father's stationery and to sign\n\nhis father's name so that it would appear to have been prepared by\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fa CPA.      There is thus no dispute that Caplitz acted with the intent\n\nto deceive Indianapolis Life by submitting an income verification\n\nstatement for the Meiselmans, which he intentionally misrepresented\n\nto have been prepared by a CPA.\n\n              The FRN defendants contend that these undisputed facts do\n\nnot warrant the entry of summary judgment because Indianapolis Life\n\nhas not submitted undisputed evidence that Caplitz's intentional\n\nmisrepresentation increased Indianapolis Life's risk of loss. They\n\nare mistaken.      Because the evidence establishes that Caplitz made\n\nthis       misrepresentation    with    the   actual   intent      to    deceive,\n\nIndianapolis       Life   was     not    required      to   show        that   the\n\nmisrepresentation increased its risk of loss.               See Boston Mut.\n\nLife, 165 F.3d at 99.      Accordingly, Indianapolis Life was properly\n\nawarded summary judgment.1\n\n              We turn now to the district court's ruling denying the\n\nFRN defendants' Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) motion for relief from the\n\ndefault judgment.      We review the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion for\n\nan abuse of discretion.         See Blanchard v. Cortes-Molina, 453 F.3d\n\n40, 44 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      At oral argument, the FRN defendants suggested that summary\njudgment should have been denied because Indianapolis Life did not\nidentify the false income verification submission as the basis for\nrescission in its letter informing the defendants of the recision\ndecision.   This argument was not raised in the FRN defendants'\ninitial brief and is therefore forfeit. See Rumierz v. Gonzales,\n456 F.3d 31, 47 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n                                        -5-\n\f            The FRN defendants' main argument is that the judgment in\n\nfavor of the Meiselmans is void.       See Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(4).\n\nThey argue that the judgment is void because the subject matter of\n\nthe Meiselmans' cross-claim is identical to a prior litigation\n\nbetween the same parties and therefore barred as res judicata.\n\n            This argument misconstrues \"a void judgment\" under Rule\n\n60(b)(4).    The \"concept of void judgments is narrowly construed.\"\n\nUnited States v. Boch Oldsmobile, Inc., 909 F.2d 657, 661 (1st Cir.\n\n1990).   A judgment is void, and therefore subject to being set\n\naside under Rule 60(b)(4), only if the court lacked jurisdiction or\n\ncommitted a plain usurpation of power constituting a violation of\n\ndue process.    See Hoult v. Hoult, 57 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1995).   \"A\n\njudgment is not void simply because it is or may have been\n\nerroneous; it is void only if, from its inception, it was a legal\n\nnullity.\"    Id.\n\n            Res judicata is an affirmative defense that is usually\n\ndeemed forfeit if not raised in the answer.         See Davignon v.\n\nClemmey, 322 F.3d 1, 15 (1st Cir. 2003) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n8(c)).      It is not a limitation on the court's jurisdiction.\n\nCf. Scherer v. Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United\n\nStates, 347 F.3d 394, 98 n.4 (2d Cir. 2003) (stating that, unlike\n\njurisdictional defects, a court is not required to apply res\n\njudicata sua sponte). Accordingly, that res judicata may have been\n\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fan available defense does not render the judgment void under Rule\n\n60(b)(4).\n\n            The FRN defendants also argue that relief from judgment\n\nshould have been granted under Rule 60(b)(1) because their failure\n\nto answer the Meiselmans' cross-claim resulted from excusable\n\nneglect. The FRN defendants have submitted an affidavit from their\n\nattorney providing several excuses for having failed to file an\n\nanswer.   Counsel claims that he was confused as to whether he had\n\nfiled the answer and was distracted by a family health problem.\n\nBut   counsel    acknowledges     that   despite     receiving    several\n\nnotifications from opposing counsel and the court that no answer\n\nhad been filed, he still did not take responsive action.          In these\n\ncircumstances, the district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\nconcluding   that   the   FRN   defendants   had   failed   to   establish\n\nexcusable neglect. See Stonkus v. City of Brockton Sch. Dep't, 322\n\nF.3d 97, 100-01 (1st Cir. 2003) (holding that excusable neglect was\n\nnot established where counsel claimed that he was confused over the\n\ncorrect filing deadline and was busy with other matters).\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\f",

Accordingly, that res judicata may have been\n\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fan available defense does not render the judgment void under Rule\n\n60(b)(4).\n\n            The FRN defendants also argue that relief from judgment\n\nshould have been granted under Rule 60(b)(1) because their failure\n\nto answer the Meiselmans' cross-claim resulted from excusable\n\nneglect. The FRN defendants have submitted an affidavit from their\n\nattorney providing several excuses for having failed to file an\n\nanswer.   Counsel claims that he was confused as to whether he had\n\nfiled the answer and was distracted by a family health problem.\n\nBut   counsel    acknowledges     that   despite     receiving    several\n\nnotifications from opposing counsel and the court that no answer\n\nhad been filed, he still did not take responsive action.          In these\n\ncircumstances, the district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\nconcluding   that   the   FRN   defendants   had   failed   to   establish\n\nexcusable neglect. See Stonkus v.
