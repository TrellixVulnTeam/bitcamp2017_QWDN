Appellant   Marlene\n\nJohansen appeals from the dismissal of her suit in the United\n\nStates District Court for the District of Massachusetts to quiet\n\ntitle on her property.         The suit was dismissed for lack of\n\njurisdiction on mootness grounds, and Johansen argues that this was\n\nerror because she has suffered damages that must be redressed by\n\nthe government.   After reviewing her arguments and the record, we\n\naffirm the dismissal of her suit.\n\n                               Background\n\n          On August 17, 2004, Johansen filed a complaint to quiet\n\nher title to a residential property in Stoneham, Massachusetts.\n\nShe contended that a tax lien the United States had asserted\n\nagainst her as nominee for her divorced ex-husband, Ralph Johansen,\n\nfor his delinquent income tax liabilities created a cloud on her\n\ntitle, effected a detriment to her creditworthiness, and damaged\n\nher. She also requested attorneys' fees under the Internal Revenue\n\nCode, 26 U.S.C. § 7430, and the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2412(d).   The government counterclaimed to foreclose the\n\ntax lien against the Stoneham property by sale.\n\n          The   district   court   initially   had   jurisdiction   over\n\nMarlene's action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1340 (general\n\njurisdictional statutes) and 2410 (which provides in relevant part\n\nthat \"the United States may be named a party in any civil action or\n\nsuit . . . having jurisdiction of the subject matter (1) to quiet\n\n                                   -2-\n\ftitle to; (2) to foreclose a mortgage or other lien upon; (3) to\n\npartition; (4) to condemn; or (5) of interpleader or in the nature\n\nof interpleader with respect to real or personal property on which\n\nthe United States has or claims a mortgage or other lien\"), and\n\nover the government's counterclaim under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1340, 1345\n\nand IRC § 7403.   During the course of the litigation, however, on\n\nAugust 22, 2005, Ralph Johansen paid in full his tax liabilities.\n\nAs a result, on September 20, 2005, the government filed a motion\n\nto dismiss the action on the grounds that it no longer had any\n\ninterest in the Stoneham property since full payment of its tax\n\nclaim had been made. Thus, the government argued, the issue raised\n\nin Johansen's suit was moot, there no longer being any occasion to\n\nquiet title, and the court being without jurisdiction to decide\n\nanything more.    Marlene Johansen opposed the motion to dismiss on\n\nthe grounds that the government's lien on her property had been\n\nwrongfully imposed from the start,1 that she had suffered damages,\n\nand that she was entitled to attorneys' fees.\n\n          On February 9, 2006, the magistrate judge recommended\n\ndismissing the case as moot.   On the same day, the government filed\n\n\n     1\n      Marlene Johansen had received the property from her ex-\nhusband as part of the divorce settlement. In its counterclaim the\ngovernment asserted that its unrecorded lien against Ralph's\ninterest in the Stoneham property was valid against Marlene and\nthat the conveyance to her was fraudulent. Marlene contends that\nupon coming to her, the property was no longer subject to the\ngovernment's claim for taxes owed by her ex-spouse and that the\ngovernment's subsequent filing of a lien on her property was\ntherefore improper.\n\n                                 -3-\n\fwith the court documents demonstrating that, on February 8, 2006,\n\nit had officially withdrawn notice of the lien on Ralph Johansen's\n\ntax    liabilities.       Marlene       Johansen    filed    objections    to   the\n\nrecommendation, arguing that she was nonetheless entitled to have\n\nthe court find that the tax lien had been wrongly placed on her\n\nproperty, and that the government's release of the lien did not\n\nalter the fact that, from the time filed until its release, the\n\nlien    was    improper    and    had    injured     her    by   undermining    her\n\ncreditworthiness.\n\n              The district court endorsed the recommendation of the\n\nmagistrate judge that because the government no longer had an\n\ninterest in the property, the case was moot, and that Johansen's\n\nother    allegations      and    her    interest    in     attorneys'   fees    were\n\ninsufficient to maintain a live controversy.                  This timely appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n                                    Discussion\n\n              On appeal, Marlene Johansen argues that her claim is not\n\nmoot, relying on the same cases which the district court's ruling\n\nproperly distinguished.          We will discuss her argument infra.            As a\n\npreliminary matter, the government argues that the appellant failed\n\nto preserve the issues she raises here on appeal as she did not\n\nspecifically      indicate      them    in    her   objections     below   to   the\n\nmagistrate      judge's    report       and    recommendations.         Johansen's\n\nobjections were, indeed, vague, but as the points she now raises\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fare clearly without merit, we need not go into the issue of their\n\npreservation.    Instead, we address her appellate claims on the\n\nmerits.\n\n          As we explain infra, when the government ceased to have\n\nan interest in the Stoneham property because the tax liabilities\n\nhad been paid, Johansen's suit to quiet title to that property\n\nbecame moot.    The only remedy to which she had been entitled under\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2410, which was the statutory basis of her suit, was\n\nremoval of the lien, and that removal was accomplished, leaving the\n\ncourt with nothing to do.   While Johansen alleged in her complaint\n\nthat the lien affected her creditworthiness and damaged her, these\n\nclaims, standing alone, were outside the province of § 2410, hence\n\nbeyond the subject matter jurisdiction of the court and leaving\n\nthem barred by the government's sovereign immunity.\n\n          The district court's legal conclusion on the motion to\n\ndismiss for lack of jurisdiction is reviewed by us de novo.    Gill\n\nv. United States, 471 F.3d 204, 205 (1st Cir. 2006).         When a\n\ndefendant moves to dismiss for lack of federal subject matter\n\njurisdiction, \"'the party invoking the jurisdiction of a federal\n\ncourt carries the burden of proving its existence.'\"      Murphy v.\n\nUnited States, 45 F.3d 520, 522 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 515 U.S.\n\n1144 (1995) (quoting Taber Partners, I. v. Merit Builders, Inc.,\n\n987 F.2d 57, 60 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 823 (1993)).   We\n\nhave held that the party advocating jurisdiction must make clear\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fthe grounds on which the court may exercise jurisdiction:   \"it is\n\nblack-letter law that jurisdiction must be apparent from the face\n\nof the plaintiffs' pleading.\"   PCS 2000 LP v. Romulus Telecomms.,\n\nInc., 148 F.3d 32, 35 (1st Cir. 1998).      If the party fails to\n\ndemonstrate a basis for jurisdiction, the district court must grant\n\nthe motion to dismiss.   Though we take as true the well-pleaded\n\nfacts of the complaint, Santa-Rosa v. Combo Records, 471 F.3d 224,\n\n226 (1st Cir. 2006), a plaintiff cannot rest a jurisdictional basis\n\n\"merely on 'unsupported conclusions or interpretations of law.'\"\n\nMurphy, 45 F.3d at 422 (quoting Washington Legal Foundation v.\n\nMassachusetts Bar Foundation, 993 F.2d 962, 971 (1st Cir. 1993)).\n\n          i.   Availability of Damages\n\n          Johansen argues that the mere fact that the United States\n\nno longer claimed an interest in the property on which the lien had\n\nbeen placed did not make the controversy moot.     She opposed the\n\ngovernment's motion to dismiss below by arguing,\n\n     The United States' motion does not provide a basis for\n     its conclusion that [the removal of the lien] adequately\n     addressed the allegations and relief sought from the\n     Court in [plaintiff's] complaint. The issue before the\n     Court remains as to whether the United States had legal\n     justification for the filing of the nominee lien, and if\n     the Court finds none, the extent of damages caused to Ms.\n     Johansen by its erroneous filing. . . . Ms. Johansen's\n     Complaint properly alleges that her creditworthiness was\n     damaged by the filing of the unlawful lien. Her matter\n     addresses the injury she suffered. Her matter is not\n     moot.\n\nAs already noted, Johansen asserted jurisdiction under general\n\njurisdictional statutes, 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1340, and under 28\n\n                                -6-\n\fU.S.C. § 2410.       As the magistrate judge found, any claim of\n\njurisdiction for the purpose of enabling plaintiff to recover money\n\ndamages for alleged detriment to the plaintiff's creditworthiness\n\nfails because § 2410 provides for federal court subject matter\n\njurisdiction and for an implicit waiver of the United States'\n\nsovereign immunity only for the adjudication of an equitable action\n\nto quiet title, and not an action for money damages.     Kulawy v.\n\nUnited States, 917 F.2d 729, 736 (2d Cir. 1990) (\"in a § 2410\n\naction, only equitable relief affecting title, and not damages, may\n\nbe awarded\").\n\n          ii.   Mootness\n\n          In finding mootness, the magistrate judge relied on Lewis\n\nv. Continental Bank Corporation, 494 U.S. 472, 477 (1990), in which\n\nthe Supreme Court set out the definition of a live controversy\n\nunder Article III:\n\n     Under Article III of the Constitution, federal courts may\n     adjudicate only actual, ongoing cases or controversies.\n     To invoke the jurisdiction of a federal court, a litigant\n     must have suffered, or be threatened with, an actual\n     injury traceable to the defendant and likely to be\n     redressed by a favorable judicial decision. Article III\n     denies federal courts the power to decide questions that\n     cannot affect the rights of litigants in the case before\n     them, and confines them to resolving real and substantial\n     controversies admitting of specific relief through a\n     decree of a conclusive character, as distinguished from\n     an opinion advising what the law would be upon a\n     hypothetical set of facts.      This case-or-controversy\n     requirement subsists through all stages of federal\n     judicial proceedings, trial and appellate.\n\nId. (internal citations and quotations omitted).\n\n\n                                -7-\n\f               Johansen   argues   that     the    question    of   whether    the\n\ngovernment was right to place a tax lien on her property amounts to\n\na still valid ongoing controversy.            She says she suffered actual\n\ninjury as a result of the wrongful lien and seeks resolution of her\n\nchallenge to the lien as a necessary condition to her becoming a\n\nprevailing party entitled to attorneys' fees under 26 U.S.C. §\n\n7430.    The magistrate judge rightly found that Johansen's position\n\ncould    not    be   sustained.      First,       the   distinction    between    a\n\n\"conclusive decree\" and an \"advisory opinion\" was reiterated in\n\nRhodes v. Stewart:\n\n     The real value of the judicial pronouncement--what makes\n     it a proper judicial resolution of a 'case or\n     controversy' rather than an advisory opinion--is in the\n     settling of some dispute which affects the behavior of\n     the defendant towards the plaintiff.\n\n488 U.S. 1, 4 (1988) (quoting Hewitt v. Helms, 482 U.S. 755, 761\n\n(1987))    (emphasis      in   original).     Here,      the   magistrate     judge\n\nconcluded, \"the desired modification of behavior underlying the\n\nplaintiff's complaint, the removal of the defendant's lien on the\n\nsubject property, has already been accomplished.                      Any further\n\njudicial pronouncements would be without 'real value.'\"2 In saying\n\n\n     2\n      When the government filed its motion to dismiss, it had\nargued that as a result of Ralph Johansen's payment of his tax\nliabilities, \"[t]he United States will release all liens against\nRalph Johansen, including those liens naming Marlene Johansen as\nthe nominee of Ralph Johansen.      The United States, therefore,\nclaims no interest in the subject property, and moves to dismiss\nthis action because there is no controversy to adjudicate.\" In her\nopposition to the motion to dismiss, Johansen did not dispute the\nfact that the tax liabilities underlying the lien had been\n\n                                      -8-\n\fthe latter, the magistrate judge reiterated what is clear: that no\n\nmatter what damages plaintiff may feel she has suffered as a result\n\nof the lien, \"no specific relief through a decree of a conclusive\n\ncharacter,\" as distinguished from a mere advisory opinion, is\n\npresently possible in this litigation.        Lewis, 494 U.S. at 477.\n\n           Second, the Supreme Court has concluded that the desire\n\nfor   attorney's   fees   is   insufficient   to   maintain   Article   III\n\njurisdiction:\n\n      At the time Continental's challenge to denial of its\n      application for an insured ISB was mooted by the\n      amendments to the BHCA, this litigation had been in\n      progress for almost seven years. An order vacating the\n      judgment   on  grounds   of  mootness  would   deprive\n      Continental of its claim for attorney's fees under 42\n\n\nresolved.      Following  the   magistrate   judge's   report  and\nrecommendation to dismiss the complaint, the government filed\ndocuments showing that on February 8, 2006 (the day before the\nreport and recommendation issued), the government withdrew three\nnotices of federal lien related to the liabilities of Ralph\nJohansen.   According to the language of I.R.C. § 6322, a lien\ncontinues \"until the liability for the amount so assessed (or a\njudgment against the taxpayer arising out of such liability) is\nsatisfied or becomes unenforceable by reason of lapse of time\"\n(emphasis supplied). Johansen did not in either her objection to\nthe report and recommendation or her initial appellate brief raise\nany objection to the fact that the formal paperwork withdrawing\nnotice of the lien was not filed until February 8, 2006. In her\nreply brief, however, she takes issue with the timing of the\nwithdrawal of the lien notice, arguing that \"the finding of\nmootness was made without evidence that the matter was moot.\" Even\nif the withdrawal of the lien notice was integral to the mootness\nof the controversy, and even if Johansen had raised this argument\nin a timely fashion instead of in her reply brief, the \"case-or-\ncontroversy requirement subsists through all stages of federal\njudicial proceedings, trial and appellate.\" Lewis, 494 U.S. at\n477.   At the time the district court approved the report and\nrecommendation, there was no lien against Johansen's property and\nthus no need to quiet the title on it.\n\n                                    -9-\n\f     U.S.C. § 1988 (assuming, arguendo, it would have such a\n     claim), because such fees are available only to a party\n     that \"prevails\" by winning the relief it seeks. This\n     interest in attorney's fees is, of course, insufficient\n     to create an Article III case or controversy where none\n     exists on the merits of the underlying claim. Where on\n     the face of the record it appears that the only concrete\n     interest in the controversy has terminated, reasonable\n     caution is needed to be sure that mooted litigation is\n     not   pressed   forward,    and   unnecessary   judicial\n     pronouncements . . . obtained solely in order to obtain\n     reimbursement of sunk costs.\n\nLewis, 4984 U.S. at 480 (internal citations omitted).             See also\n\nBuckhannon Bd. & Care Home, Inc. v. W.V. Dep't of Health & Human\n\nResources,   532   U.S.   598,   605   (2001)   (holding   that   the   term\n\n\"prevail\" denotes \"a judicially sanctioned change in the legal\n\nrelationship of the parties\").         We have held that \"Buckhannon is\n\npresumed to apply generally to all fee-shifting statutes that use\n\nthe 'prevailing party' terminology.\"        The situation here, as the\n\nmagistrate judge pointed out, is parallel to Lewis in that the\n\nconcrete interest in the controversy has terminated with the\n\nremoval of the tax lien from the property.         To be sure, plaintiff\n\nmay feel a dispute still lingers over the United States' legal\n\njustification for filing the lien in the first place.              Section\n\n2410, however, makes no provision for adjudicating such a question\n\nnow that the lien no longer exists, leaving the court without\n\njurisdiction to do so.     And this Circuit has recently held that a\n\n\"litigant's interest in a possible award of attorney's fees is not\n\nenough to create a justiciable case or controversy if none exists\n\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fon the merits of the underlying claim.\"      Goodwin v. C.N.J., Inc.,\n\n436 F.3d 44, 51 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n          Johansen    cites   on   appeal   two   additional   cases   as\n\nsupporting her argument, Rainey v. Jackson State College, 481 F.2d\n\n347 (6th Cir. 1973) and Education/Instruccion, Inc. v. United\n\nStates, 471 F. Supp. 1074 (D. Mass. 1979).        Neither case, however,\n\neven assuming their applicability, lends persuasive support to\n\nplaintiff's position here, since both have since been superceded by\n\nthe Supreme Court's decision in Buckhannon. See also Oil, Chemical\n\n& Atomic Workers Int'l Union v. Dep't of Energy, 288 F.3d 452, 455\n\n(D.C.

The suit was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction on mootness grounds, and Johansen argues that this was error because she has suffered damages that must be redressed by the government. After reviewing her arguments and the record, we <i>affirm</i> the dismissal of her suit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Background</i></h2>\n<p>On August 17, 2004, Johansen filed a complaint to quiet her title to a residential property in Stoneham, Massachusetts. She contended that a tax lien the United States had asserted against her as nominee for her divorced ex-husband, Ralph Johansen, for his delinquent income tax liabilities created a cloud on her title, effected a detriment to her creditworthiness, and damaged her. She also requested attorneys' fees under the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 7430, and the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d). The government counterclaimed to foreclose the tax lien against the Stoneham property by sale.</p>\n<p>The district court initially had jurisdiction over Marlene's action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1340 (general jurisdictional statutes) and 2410 (which provides in relevant part that \"the United States may be named a party in any civil action or suit . . . having jurisdiction of the subject <span class=\"star-pagination\">*67</span> matter (1) to quiet title to; (2) to foreclose a mortgage or other lien upon; (3) to partition; (4) to condemn; or (5) of interpleader or in the nature of interpleader with respect to real or personal property on which the United States has or claims a mortgage or other lien\"), and over the government's counterclaim under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1340, 1345 and IRC § 7403. During the course of the litigation, however, on August 22, 2005, Ralph Johansen paid in full his tax liabilities. As a result, on September 20, 2005, the government filed a motion to dismiss the action on the grounds that it no longer had any interest in the Stoneham property since full payment of its tax claim had been made. Thus, the government argued, the issue raised in Johansen's suit was moot, there no longer being any occasion to quiet title, and the court being without jurisdiction to decide anything more. Marlene Johansen opposed the motion to dismiss on the grounds that the government's lien on her property had been wrongfully imposed from the start,<sup>[1]</sup> that she had suffered damages, and that she was entitled to attorneys' fees.</p>\n<p>On February 9, 2006, the magistrate judge recommended dismissing the case as moot. On the same day, the government filed with the court documents demonstrating that, on February 8, 2006, it had officially withdrawn notice of the lien on Ralph Johansen's tax liabilities. Marlene Johansen filed objections to the recommendation, arguing that she was nonetheless entitled to have the court find that the tax lien had been wrongly placed on her property, and that the government's release of the lien did not alter the fact that, from the time filed until its release, the lien was improper and had injured her by undermining her creditworthiness.</p>\n<p>The district court endorsed the recommendation of the magistrate judge that because the government no longer had an interest in the property, the case was moot, and that Johansen's other allegations and her interest in attorneys' fees were insufficient to maintain a live controversy. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Discussion</h2>\n<p>On appeal, Marlene Johansen argues that her claim is not moot, relying on the same cases which the district court's ruling properly distinguished. We will discuss her argument <i>infra.</i> As a preliminary matter, the government argues that the appellant failed to preserve the issues she raises here on appeal as she did not specifically indicate them in her objections below to the magistrate judge's report and recommendations. Johansen's objections were, indeed, vague, but as the points she now raises are clearly without merit, we need not go into the issue of their preservation. Instead, we address her appellate claims on the merits.</p>\n<p>As we explain <i>infra,</i> when the government ceased to have an interest in the Stoneham property because the tax liabilities had been paid, Johansen's suit to quiet title to that property became moot. The only remedy to which she had been entitled under 28 U.S.C. § 2410, which was the statutory basis of her suit, was removal of the lien, and that removal was accomplished, leaving the court with nothing to do. While Johansen alleged in her complaint <span class=\"star-pagination\">*68</span> that the lien affected her creditworthiness and damaged her, these claims, standing alone, were outside the province of § 2410, hence beyond the subject matter jurisdiction of the court and leaving them barred by the government's sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p>The district court's legal conclusion on the motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction is reviewed by us de novo. <i>Gill v. United States,</i> 471 F.3d 204, 205 (1st Cir.2006). When a defendant moves to dismiss for lack of federal subject matter jurisdiction, \"`the party invoking the jurisdiction of a federal court carries the burden of proving its existence.'\" <i>Murphy v. United States,</i> 45 F.3d 520, 522 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 515 U.S. 1144, 115 S.Ct. 2581, 132 L.Ed.2d 831 (1995) (quoting <i>Taber Partners, I. v. Merit Builders, Inc.,</i> 987 F.2d 57, 60 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 510 U.S. 823, 114 S.Ct. 82, 126 L.Ed.2d 50 (1993)). We have held that the party advocating jurisdiction must make clear the grounds on which the court may exercise jurisdiction: \"it is black-letter law that jurisdiction must be apparent from the face of the plaintiffs' pleading.\" <i>PCS 2000 LP v. Romulus Telecomms., Inc.,</i> 148 F.3d 32, 35 (1st Cir.1998). If the party fails to demonstrate a basis for jurisdiction, the district court must grant the motion to dismiss. Though we take as true the well-pleaded facts of the complaint, <i>Santa-Rosa v. Combo Records,</i> 471 F.3d 224, 226 (1st Cir.2006), a plaintiff cannot rest a jurisdictional basis \"merely on `unsupported conclusions or interpretations of law.'\" <i>Murphy,</i> 45 F.3d at 522 (quoting <i>Washington Legal Foundation v. Massachusetts Bar Foundation,</i> 993 F.2d 962, 971 (1st Cir.1993)).</p>\n<p>i. Availability of Damages</p>\n<p>Johansen argues that the mere fact that the United States no longer claimed an interest in the property on which the lien had been placed did not make the controversy moot. She opposed the government's motion to dismiss below by arguing,</p>\n<blockquote>The United States' motion does not provide a basis for its conclusion that [the removal of the lien] adequately addressed the allegations and relief sought from the Court in [plaintiff's] complaint. The issue before the Court remains as to whether the United States had legal justification for the filing of the nominee lien, and if the Court finds none, the extent of damages caused to Ms. Johansen by its erroneous filing. . . . Ms. Johansen's Complaint properly alleges that her creditworthiness was damaged by the filing of the unlawful lien. Her matter addresses the injury she suffered. Her matter is not moot.</blockquote>\n<p>As already noted, Johansen asserted jurisdiction under general jurisdictional statutes, 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1340, and under 28 U.S.C. § 2410. As the magistrate judge found, any claim of jurisdiction for the purpose of enabling plaintiff to recover money damages for alleged detriment to the plaintiff's creditworthiness fails because § 2410 provides for federal court subject matter jurisdiction and for an implicit waiver of the United States' sovereign immunity only for the adjudication of an equitable action to quiet title, and not an action for money damages. <i>Kulawy v. United States,</i> 917 F.2d 729, 736 (2d Cir.1990) (\"in a § 2410 action, only equitable relief affecting title, and not damages, may be awarded\").</p>\n<p>ii. Mootness</p>\n<p>In finding mootness, the magistrate judge relied on <i>Lewis v. Continental Bank Corporation,</i> 494 U.S. 472, 477, 110 S.Ct. 1249, 108 L.Ed.2d 400 (1990), in which the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*69</span> Supreme Court set out the definition of a live controversy under Article III:</p>\n<blockquote>Under Article III of the Constitution, federal courts may adjudicate only actual, ongoing cases or controversies. To invoke the jurisdiction of a federal court, a litigant must have suffered, or be threatened with, an actual injury traceable to the defendant and likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision. Article III denies federal courts the power to decide questions that cannot affect the rights of litigants in the case before them, and confines them to resolving real and substantial controversies <i>admitting of specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character,</i> as distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical set of facts. This case-or-controversy requirement subsists through all stages of federal judicial proceedings, trial and appellate.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> (internal citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p>Johansen argues that the question of whether the government was right to place a tax lien on her property amounts to a still valid ongoing controversy. She says she suffered actual injury as a result of the wrongful lien and seeks resolution of her challenge to the lien as a necessary condition to her becoming a prevailing party entitled to attorneys' fees under 26 U.S.C. § 7430. The magistrate judge rightly found that Johansen's position could not be sustained. First, the distinction between a \"conclusive decree\" and an \"advisory opinion\" was reiterated in <i>Rhodes v. Stewart</i>:</p>\n<blockquote>The real value of the judicial pronouncementwhat makes it a proper judicial resolution of a \"case or controversy\" rather than an advisory opinionis in the settling of some dispute <i>which affects the behavior of the defendant towards the plaintiff.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p>488 U.S. 1, 4, 109 S.Ct. 202, 102 L.Ed.2d 1 (1988) (quoting <i>Hewitt v. Helms,</i> 482 U.S. 755, 761, 107 S.Ct. 2672, 96 L.Ed.2d 654 (1987)) (emphasis in original). Here, the magistrate judge concluded, \"the desired modification of behavior underlying the plaintiff's complaint, the removal of the defendant's lien on the subject property, has already been accomplished. Any further judicial pronouncements would be without `real value.'\"<sup>[2]</sup> In saying the latter, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*70</span> the magistrate judge reiterated what is clear: that no matter what damages plaintiff may feel she has suffered as a result of the lien, \"no specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character,\" as distinguished from a mere advisory opinion, is presently possible in this litigation. <i>Lewis,</i> 494 U.S. at 477, 110 S.Ct. 1249.</p>\n<p>Second, the Supreme Court has concluded that the desire for attorney's fees is insufficient to maintain Article III jurisdiction:</p>\n<blockquote>At the time Continental's challenge to denial of its application for an insured ISB was mooted by the amendments to the BHCA, this litigation had been in progress for almost seven years. An order vacating the judgment on grounds of mootness would deprive Continental of its claim for attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988 (assuming, <i>arguendo,</i> it would have such a claim), because such fees are available only to a party that \"prevails\" by winning the relief it seeks. This interest in attorney's fees is, of course, insufficient to create an Article III case or controversy where none exists on the merits of the underlying claim. Where on the face of the record it appears that the only concrete interest in the controversy has terminated, reasonable caution is needed to be sure that mooted litigation is not pressed forward, and unnecessary judicial pronouncements . . . obtained solely in order to obtain reimbursement of sunk costs.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Lewis,</i> 494 U.S. at 480, 110 S.Ct. 1249 (internal citations omitted). <i>See also </i><i>Buckhannon Bd. &amp; Care Home, Inc. v. W.V. Dep't of Health &amp; Human Resources,</i> 532 U.S. 598, 605, 121 S.Ct. 1835, 149 L.Ed.2d 855 (2001) (holding that the term \"prevail\" denotes \"a judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties\"). We have held that \"<i>Buckhannon</i> is presumed to apply generally to all fee-shifting statutes that use the `prevailing party' terminology.\" The situation here, as the magistrate judge pointed out, is parallel to <i>Lewis</i> in that the concrete interest in the controversy has terminated with the removal of the tax lien from the property. To be sure, plaintiff may feel a dispute still lingers over the United States' legal justification for filing the lien in the first place. Section 2410, however, makes no provision for adjudicating such a question now that the lien no longer exists, leaving the court without jurisdiction to do so. And this Circuit has recently held that a \"litigant's interest in a possible award of attorney's fees is not enough to create a justiciable case or controversy if none exists on the merits of the underlying claim.\" <i>Goodwin v. C.N.J., Inc.,</i> 436 F.3d 44, 51 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>Johansen cites on appeal two additional cases as supporting her argument, <i>Rainey v. Jackson State College,</i> 481 F.2d 347 (6th Cir.1973) and <i>Education/Instruccion, Inc. v. United States,</i> 471 F.Supp. 1074 (D.Mass.1979). Neither case, however, even assuming their applicability, lends persuasive support to plaintiff's position here, since both have since been superceded by the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Buckhannon. See also </i><i>Oil, Chemical &amp; Atomic Workers Int'l Union v. Dep't of Energy,</i> 288 F.3d 452, 455 (D.C.Cir.2002) (existing case law must give way to the extent it does not require a plaintiff to have \"been awarded some relief by [a] court\" to become eligible for fees).</p>\n<p>In the absence of any federal remedy under the statutory provisions plaintiff relies <span class=\"star-pagination\">*71</span> upon, we must affirm the judgment of the district court. <i>AFFIRMED.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Marlene Johansen had received the property from her ex-husband as part of the divorce settlement. In its counterclaim the government asserted that its unrecorded lien against Ralph's interest in the Stoneham property was valid against Marlene and that the conveyance to her was fraudulent. Marlene contends that upon coming to her, the property was no longer subject to the government's claim for taxes owed by her ex-spouse and that the government's subsequent filing of a lien on her property was therefore improper.</p>\n<p>[2]  When the government filed its motion to dismiss, it had argued that as a result of Ralph Johansen's payment of his tax liabilities, \"[t]he United States will release all liens against Ralph Johansen, including those liens naming Marlene Johansen as the nominee of Ralph Johansen. The United States, therefore, claims no interest in the subject property, and moves to dismiss this action because there is no controversy to adjudicate.\" In her opposition to the motion to dismiss, Johansen did not dispute the fact that the tax liabilities underlying the lien had been resolved. Following the magistrate judge's report and recommendation to dismiss the complaint, the government filed documents showing that on February 8, 2006 (the day before the report and recommendation issued), the government withdrew three notices of federal lien related to the liabilities of Ralph Johansen. According to the language of I.R.C. § 6322, a lien continues \"until the liability for the amount so assessed (or a judgment against the taxpayer arising out of such liability) is <i>satisfied</i> or becomes unenforceable by reason of lapse of time\" (emphasis supplied). Johansen did not in either her objection to the report and recommendation or her initial appellate brief raise any objection to the fact that the formal paperwork withdrawing notice of the lien was not filed until February 8, 2006. In her reply brief, however, she takes issue with the timing of the withdrawal of the lien notice, arguing that \"the finding of mootness was made without evidence that the matter was moot.\" Even if the withdrawal of the lien notice was integral to the mootness of the controversy, and even if Johansen had raised this argument in a timely fashion instead of in her reply brief, the \"case-or-controversy requirement subsists through all stages of federal judicial proceedings, trial and appellate.\" <i>Lewis,</i> 494 U.S. at 477, 110 S.Ct. 1249. At the time the district court approved the report and recommendation, there was no lien against Johansen's property and thus no need to quiet the title on it.</p>\n\n</div>",

The suit was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction on mootness grounds, and Johansen argues that this was error because she has suffered damages that must be redressed by the government. After reviewing her arguments and the record, we <i>affirm</i> the dismissal of her suit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Background</i></h2>\n<p>On August 17, 2004, Johansen filed a complaint to quiet her title to a residential property in Stoneham, Massachusetts. She contended that a tax lien the United States had asserted against her as nominee for her divorced ex-husband, Ralph Johansen, for his delinquent income tax liabilities created a cloud on her title, effected a detriment to her creditworthiness, and damaged her. She also requested attorneys' fees under the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 7430, and the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d). The government counterclaimed to foreclose the tax lien against the Stoneham property by sale.</p>\n<p>The district court initially had jurisdiction over Marlene's action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1340 (general jurisdictional statutes) and 2410 (which provides in relevant part that \"the United States may be named a party in any civil action or suit . . . having jurisdiction of the subject <span class=\"star-pagination\">*67</span> matter (1) to quiet title to; (2) to foreclose a mortgage or other lien upon; (3) to partition; (4) to condemn; or (5) of interpleader or in the nature of interpleader with respect to real or personal property on which the United States has or claims a mortgage or other lien\"), and over the government's counterclaim under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1340, 1345 and IRC § 7403. During the course of the litigation, however, on August 22, 2005, Ralph Johansen paid in full his tax liabilities. As a result, on September 20, 2005, the government filed a motion to dismiss the action on the grounds that it no longer had any interest in the Stoneham property since full payment of its tax claim had been made. Thus, the government argued, the issue raised in Johansen's suit was moot, there no longer being any occasion to quiet title, and the court being without jurisdiction to decide anything more. Marlene Johansen opposed the motion to dismiss on the grounds that the government's lien on her property had been wrongfully imposed from the start,<sup>[1]</sup> that she had suffered damages, and that she was entitled to attorneys' fees.</p>\n<p>On February 9, 2006, the magistrate judge recommended dismissing the case as moot. On the same day, the government filed with the court documents demonstrating that, on February 8, 2006, it had officially withdrawn notice of the lien on Ralph Johansen's tax liabilities. Marlene Johansen filed objections to the recommendation, arguing that she was nonetheless entitled to have the court find that the tax lien had been wrongly placed on her property, and that the government's release of the lien did not alter the fact that, from the time filed until its release, the lien was improper and had injured her by undermining her creditworthiness.</p>\n<p>The district court endorsed the recommendation of the magistrate judge that because the government no longer had an interest in the property, the case was moot, and that Johansen's other allegations and her interest in attorneys' fees were insufficient to maintain a live controversy. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Discussion</h2>\n<p>On appeal, Marlene Johansen argues that her claim is not moot, relying on the same cases which the district court's ruling properly distinguished. We will discuss her argument <i>infra.</i> As a preliminary matter, the government argues that the appellant failed to preserve the issues she raises here on appeal as she did not specifically indicate them in her objections below to the magistrate judge's report and recommendations.

Here, the magistrate judge concluded, \"the desired modification of behavior underlying the plaintiff's complaint, the removal of the defendant's lien on the subject property, has already been accomplished. Any further judicial pronouncements would be without `real value.'\"<sup>[2]</sup> In saying the latter, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*70</span> the magistrate judge reiterated what is clear: that no matter what damages plaintiff may feel she has suffered as a result of the lien, \"no specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character,\" as distinguished from a mere advisory opinion, is presently possible in this litigation. <i>Lewis,</i> 494 U.S. at 477, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112389\"><a href=\"/opinion/112389/lewis-v-continental-bank-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

An order vacating the judgment on grounds of mootness would deprive Continental of its claim for attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988 (assuming, <i>arguendo,</i> it would have such a claim), because such fees are available only to a party that \"prevails\" by winning the relief it seeks. This interest in attorney's fees is, of course, insufficient to create an Article III case or controversy where none exists on the merits of the underlying claim. Where on the face of the record it appears that the only concrete interest in the controversy has terminated, reasonable caution is needed to be sure that mooted litigation is not pressed forward, and unnecessary judicial pronouncements . . . obtained solely in order to obtain reimbursement of sunk costs.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Lewis,</i> 494 U.S. at 480, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112389\"><a href=\"/opinion/112389/lewis-v-continental-bank-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We have held that \"<i>Buckhannon</i> is presumed to apply generally to all fee-shifting statutes that use the `prevailing party' terminology.\" The situation here, as the magistrate judge pointed out, is parallel to <i>Lewis</i> in that the concrete interest in the controversy has terminated with the removal of the tax lien from the property. To be sure, plaintiff may feel a dispute still lingers over the United States' legal justification for filing the lien in the first place. Section 2410, however, makes no provision for adjudicating such a question now that the lien no longer exists, leaving the court without jurisdiction to do so. And this Circuit has recently held that a \"litigant's interest in a possible award of attorney's fees is not enough to create a justiciable case or controversy if none exists on the merits of the underlying claim.\" <i>Goodwin v.

In its counterclaim the government asserted that its unrecorded lien against Ralph's interest in the Stoneham property was valid against Marlene and that the conveyance to her was fraudulent. Marlene contends that upon coming to her, the property was no longer subject to the government's claim for taxes owed by her ex-spouse and that the government's subsequent filing of a lien on her property was therefore improper.</p>\n<p>[2]  When the government filed its motion to dismiss, it had argued that as a result of Ralph Johansen's payment of his tax liabilities, \"[t]he United States will release all liens against Ralph Johansen, including those liens naming Marlene Johansen as the nominee of Ralph Johansen. The United States, therefore, claims no interest in the subject property, and moves to dismiss this action because there is no controversy to adjudicate.\" In her opposition to the motion to dismiss, Johansen did not dispute the fact that the tax liabilities underlying the lien had been resolved. Following the magistrate judge's report and recommendation to dismiss the complaint, the government filed documents showing that on February 8, 2006 (the day before the report and recommendation issued), the government withdrew three notices of federal lien related to the liabilities of Ralph Johansen. According to the language of I.R.C. § 6322, a lien continues \"until the liability for the amount so assessed (or a judgment against the taxpayer arising out of such liability) is <i>satisfied</i> or becomes unenforceable by reason of lapse of time\" (emphasis supplied). Johansen did not in either her objection to the report and recommendation or her initial appellate brief raise any objection to the fact that the formal paperwork withdrawing notice of the lien was not filed until February 8, 2006. In her reply brief, however, she takes issue with the timing of the withdrawal of the lien notice, arguing that \"the finding of mootness was made without evidence that the matter was moot.\" Even if the withdrawal of the lien notice was integral to the mootness of the controversy, and even if Johansen had raised this argument in a timely fashion instead of in her reply brief, the \"case-or-controversy requirement subsists through all stages of federal judicial proceedings, trial and appellate.\" <i>Lewis,</i> 494 U.S. at 477, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112389\"><a href=\"/opinion/112389/lewis-v-continental-bank-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1249</span></a></span>. At the time the district court approved the report and recommendation, there was no lien against Johansen's property and thus no need to quiet the title on it.</p>\n\n</div>",
