R. App. P. 43(c)(2), Acting Attorney General\nPeter D. Keisler is substituted for former Attorney General\nAlberto R. Gonzáles as respondent.\n\f             TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.      On August 23, 2006, the Board\n\nof Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") dismissed Petitioner Lahouari Saad's\n\nappeal of a decision by an Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") rejecting his\n\nclaims of asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the\n\nConvention Against Torture (\"CAT\").         Saad now petitions for review\n\nof the BIA's dismissal, arguing that (1) the absence of a formal\n\ndenial of Saad's asylum application in the IJ's oral decision\n\nrequired the BIA to remand the case; (2) the IJ's failure to\n\nprovide     an   explanation   regarding   Saad's   ineligibility        for   an\n\nexception to the one-year deadline for asylum claims warrants\n\nremand; and (3) based on the evidence, the BIA erred in finding\n\nthat Saad failed to establish an objectively reasonable fear of\n\npersecution. After consideration of Saad's arguments, we note that\n\nwe   lack   jurisdiction   to    review    the   finding   that    his   asylum\n\napplication was untimely, and on the remaining claims, we deny the\n\npetition for review.\n\n                                I. Background\n\n             Saad is a thirty-nine-year-old native and citizen of\n\nAlgeria, who was admitted to the United States on July 13, 1997 on\n\na six-month visitor's visa and remained beyond the authorized\n\nperiod.     His claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT\n\nrelief stem from repeated attempts by the Islamic Salvation Front\n\n(\"FIS,\" for its French acronym), a radical Islamic group, to\n\nrecruit Saad in his hometown of Oran in early 1997.               According to\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fSaad's testimony, he was initially approached by two FIS members\n\nwhen they asked him for a hotel recommendation while they stayed in\n\nOran, visiting a sick friend in the hospital where Saad worked.\n\nOver the next few days, these men approached Saad three more times\n\noutside the hospital, each time \"strongly\" urging him to join FIS\n\nand help provide the group with medical supplies. When he declined\n\nduring the second encounter, the men became \"very rude\" and told\n\nhim they would give him some time to \"think about it.\"         During the\n\nfinal confrontation, one of the FIS members grabbed Saad by the\n\nthroat and said, \"Listen, we are not kidding here.\"           After this\n\nlast encounter, Saad never returned to work at the hospital because\n\nhe was afraid for his life.   He immediately applied for a visitor's\n\nvisa to the United States and left Algeria six weeks later.\n\n           During the interim six weeks, Saad had no contact with\n\nthe two FIS members.    He does not know their names, and there is no\n\nevidence that they knew his.       Saad also stated that, as far as he\n\nknew, the FIS members never looked for him at his house or\n\napproached any of his seven siblings or his parents, all of whom\n\nremained in Algeria.\n\n           In his testimony, Saad also related two other instances\n\ninvolving people he knew, which made him particularly fearful.          In\n\n1995, a friend of Saad's was killed by the Armed Islamic Group\n\nbecause he was cooperating with police in an investigation.           Saad\n\nalso   knew   another   hospital    worker   who   had   cooperated   with\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fterrorists and, as a result, had \"disappeared\" at the hands of the\n\npolice.       Saad did not testify that he had any personal connection\n\nto either incident.\n\n              Upon arriving in the United States in 1997, Saad did not\n\nimmediately apply for asylum.            In 2000 or 2001, he consulted an\n\nattorney when he purportedly won the diversity visa lottery, but\n\ndid not take any action to legalize his immigration status at that\n\ntime.     On January 28, 2003, he reported for processing under the\n\nrequirements of the National Security Entry Exit Registration\n\nSystem and was served with a Notice to Appear charging him with\n\nbeing removable.\n\n              Consequently, Saad filed claims for asylum, withholding\n\nof removal, and protection under the CAT. Because the asylum claim\n\nwas filed beyond the one-year deadline, Saad also submitted written\n\narguments and an affidavit alleging \"changed or extraordinary\n\ncircumstances\" that would excuse his failure to timely file.                  Saad\n\nargued that his omission was a direct result of his lack of\n\nknowledge of the asylum laws in the United States.               It is unclear\n\nfrom    the    record    whether   the   IJ    ever   specifically   denied   the\n\nexception to the one-year deadline.               However, when the IJ asked\n\nduring the proceedings whether this was \"a withholding only case,\"\n\nSaad's    counsel       responded,   \"Yes,     Your   Honor,   that's   correct.\n\nBecause the application for asylum is years after the fact.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\f           In an oral opinion, the IJ denied Saad's applications for\n\nwithholding    of   removal   and    CAT   protection,    but    granted   him\n\nvoluntary departure and issued an alternative order of removal to\n\nAlgeria. Regarding Saad's original asylum claim, the IJ noted that\n\nit had been \"time barred in that [Saad] failed to file within the\n\none year limit and [Saad's] attorney concede[d] that [Saad's]\n\nrequest for relief is limited to withholding of removal.\" A formal\n\norder denying the asylum claim was not included in the oral\n\ndecision but was included in the written decision.\n\n           In denying Saad's other claims, the IJ found that Saad\n\nwas \"generally credible,\" but also found that, even assuming the\n\nfacts related by Saad were true, his past \"encounters with the FIS\n\nin   Algeria   cannot   be   said   to   amount   to   persecution\"   because\n\npersecution \"must amount to an experience that rises above mere\n\nunpleasantness, harassment, or even basic suffering.\" Further, the\n\njudge also found that Saad failed to show \"a clear probability that\n\nhe will be persecuted if he returns to Algeria.\"                Finally, with\n\nrespect to the CAT claim, the IJ concluded that Saad did not meet\n\nhis burden of proof because \"[t]here is no evidence of Government\n\ninvolvement in this case or any reference to torture.\"\n\n           The BIA dismissed Saad's appeal, rejecting his argument\n\nthat a remand was necessary because the IJ did not formally deny\n\nthe asylum application at the conclusion of his oral decision,\n\nconcluding that \"any omission . . . is harmless\" and a remand would\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fbe \"administratively burdensome.\" The BIA also concluded that Saad\n\nhad failed to show changed or extraordinary circumstances necessary\n\nto excuse an untimely asylum application.       Finally, the BIA held\n\nthat the IJ properly dismissed the withholding of removal and CAT\n\nclaims because Saad had failed to establish past persecution or\n\ntorture, or a likelihood of future persecution or torture.\n\n                              II. Discussion\n\n             On this petition for judicial review, Saad claims that\n\n(1) the absence of a formal denial of his asylum application in the\n\nIJ's oral decision was not, as the BIA found, a harmless error; (2)\n\nthe   IJ's     failure   to   provide    reasoning   regarding   Saad's\n\nineligibility for an exception to the one-year deadline warranted\n\nremand; and (3) based on the evidence, the IJ and BIA erred in\n\nfinding that Saad failed to carry his burden of establishing past\n\npersecution or a likelihood of future persecution.\n\n             We review the BIA's decision as the final agency order.\n\nMukamusoni v. Ashcroft, 390 F.3d 110, 119 (1st Cir. 2004). Whether\n\nor not an alien has met his burden is a determination that we\n\nreview under the deferential \"substantial evidence\" standard.      See\n\nEstrada-Canales v. Gonzáles, 437 F.3d 208, 215 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\nUnder this standard, the BIA's findings of fact are \"conclusive\n\nunless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to\n\nthe contrary.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B).       We will thus uphold the\n\nBIA's decision if it is \"supported by reasonable, substantial, and\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fprobative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\" Nikijuluw\n\nv. Gonzáles, 427 F.3d 115, 120 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting INS v.\n\nElías-Zacarías, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992)).\n\n          To establish eligibility for asylum, an alien must show\n\nthat he is a \"refugee\" within the meaning of the Immigration and\n\nNationality Act.   See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(A).   The alien may meet\n\nhis burden by establishing past persecution or a well-founded fear\n\nof future persecution on account of an enumerated ground.        See\n\nToloza-Jiménez v. Gonzáles, 457 F.3d 155, 161 (1st Cir. 2006). \"To\n\nqualify as persecution, a person's experience must rise above\n\nunpleasantness, harassment, and even basic suffering.\"     Nelson v.\n\nINS, 232 F.3d 258, 263 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n          An alien must seek asylum within one year of entering the\n\nUnited States, although the failure to file may be excused if the\n\nalien shows \"changed circumstances which materially affect the\n\napplicant's eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances\n\nrelating to the delay in filing an application.\"     8 U.S.C. § 1158\n\n(a)(2)(D).   However, \"[n]o court shall have jurisdiction to review\n\nany determination of the Attorney General under [§ 1158(a)(2)].\"\n\nId. § 1158(a)(3); see Pan v. Gonzáles, 489 F.3d 80 84 (1st Cir.\n\n2007).   Therefore, this court lacks jurisdiction to review the\n\nBIA's finding that Saad's application was time-barred.\n\n          If the alien does not qualify for asylum because he fails\n\nto meet the one-year deadline, he may still qualify for withholding\n\n\n                                -7-\n\fof removal.   The burden, however, is higher, in that the applicant\n\nmust   demonstrate   that    he    is    more   likely    than   not    to   face\n\npersecution on account of a protected ground.             Silva v. Gonzáles,\n\n463 F.3d 68, 72 (1st Cir. 2006); see also Raza v. Gonzáles, 484\n\nF.3d 125, 129 (1st Cir. 2007) (\"A claim for withholding of removal\n\ncarries with it a more stringent burden of proof than does a\n\ncounterpart effort to obtain asylum.\" (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted)). Similarly, to qualify for protection under the CAT, the\n\nalien must establish that it is more likely than not that he would\n\nbe tortured if he      returned to his home country.                   Stroni v.\n\nGonzáles, 454 F.3d 82, 89-90 (1st Cir. 2006) (quoting 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 208.16(c)(2)).     Torture refers to \"an extreme form of cruel and\n\ninhuman treatment,\" 8 C.F.R. § 1208.18(a)(2), dealt at the hand of\n\nor with the acquiescence of the government.              See Stroni, 454 F.3d\n\nat 90.\n\n           In this case, the BIA found that Saad had not established\n\na likelihood of persecution or torture.              We agree that there was\n\nsubstantial   evidence      to    support     this   finding.      The       FIS's\n\nrecruitment efforts were undoubtedly unpleasant, but they did not\n\nrise to the level of persecution or torture, see Nelson, 232 F.3d\n\nat 263-64, and there is no reason to suspect that the FIS will\n\npursue Saad were he to return to Algeria.              Consequently, Saad is\n\nnot eligible for withholding of removal or CAT relief.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\f                       III. Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we deny the petition for\n\nreview.\n\n          Denied.\n\n\n\n\n                             -9-\n\f",

On August 23, 2006, the Board\n\nof Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") dismissed Petitioner Lahouari Saad's\n\nappeal of a decision by an Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") rejecting his\n\nclaims of asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the\n\nConvention Against Torture (\"CAT\").         Saad now petitions for review\n\nof the BIA's dismissal, arguing that (1) the absence of a formal\n\ndenial of Saad's asylum application in the IJ's oral decision\n\nrequired the BIA to remand the case; (2) the IJ's failure to\n\nprovide     an   explanation   regarding   Saad's   ineligibility        for   an\n\nexception to the one-year deadline for asylum claims warrants\n\nremand; and (3) based on the evidence, the BIA erred in finding\n\nthat Saad failed to establish an objectively reasonable fear of\n\npersecution.

Regarding Saad's original asylum claim, the IJ noted that\n\nit had been \"time barred in that [Saad] failed to file within the\n\none year limit and [Saad's] attorney concede[d] that [Saad's]\n\nrequest for relief is limited to withholding of removal.\" A formal\n\norder denying the asylum claim was not included in the oral\n\ndecision but was included in the written decision.\n\n           In denying Saad's other claims, the IJ found that Saad\n\nwas \"generally credible,\" but also found that, even assuming the\n\nfacts related by Saad were true, his past \"encounters with the FIS\n\nin   Algeria   cannot   be   said   to   amount   to   persecution\"   because\n\npersecution \"must amount to an experience that rises above mere\n\nunpleasantness, harassment, or even basic suffering.\" Further, the\n\njudge also found that Saad failed to show \"a clear probability that\n\nhe will be persecuted if he returns to Algeria.\"                Finally, with\n\nrespect to the CAT claim, the IJ concluded that Saad did not meet\n\nhis burden of proof because \"[t]here is no evidence of Government\n\ninvolvement in this case or any reference to torture.\"\n\n           The BIA dismissed Saad's appeal, rejecting his argument\n\nthat a remand was necessary because the IJ did not formally deny\n\nthe asylum application at the conclusion of his oral decision,\n\nconcluding that \"any omission . . . is harmless\" and a remand would\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fbe \"administratively burdensome.\" The BIA also concluded that Saad\n\nhad failed to show changed or extraordinary circumstances necessary\n\nto excuse an untimely asylum application.       Finally, the BIA held\n\nthat the IJ properly dismissed the withholding of removal and CAT\n\nclaims because Saad had failed to establish past persecution or\n\ntorture, or a likelihood of future persecution or torture.\n\n                              II. Discussion\n\n             On this petition for judicial review, Saad claims that\n\n(1) the absence of a formal denial of his asylum application in the\n\nIJ's oral decision was not, as the BIA found, a harmless error; (2)\n\nthe   IJ's     failure   to   provide    reasoning   regarding   Saad's\n\nineligibility for an exception to the one-year deadline warranted\n\nremand; and (3) based on the evidence, the IJ and BIA erred in\n\nfinding that Saad failed to carry his burden of establishing past\n\npersecution or a likelihood of future persecution.\n\n             We review the BIA's decision as the final agency order.\n\nMukamusoni v.

We will thus uphold the\n\nBIA's decision if it is \"supported by reasonable, substantial, and\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fprobative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\" Nikijuluw\n\nv.

Therefore, this court lacks jurisdiction to review the\n\nBIA's finding that Saad's application was time-barred.\n\n          If the alien does not qualify for asylum because he fails\n\nto meet the one-year deadline, he may still qualify for withholding\n\n\n                                -7-\n\fof removal.
