Petitioner, a citizen of Indonesia, whose\n\napplications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under\n\nthe Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\") were denied, has petitioned\n\nfor review of the Board of Immigration Appeals' denial of his\n\nmotion for reconsideration and has moved for a stay of his removal\n\npending such review.      Respondent has opposed the motion for a stay\n\nand has cross-moved for summary disposition.                 For the reasons\n\ndiscussed below, after careful review of the entire record and the\n\nparties'    respective    motions,    we   summarily    deny   the   petition,\n\nthereby mooting the motion for a stay of removal.\n\n            Because petitioner did not file a timely appeal from the\n\nNovember 30, 2007 decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals\n\n(\"BIA\") dismissing his appeal from the decision of the Immigration\n\nJudge (\"IJ\") denying his application for asylum, withholding of\n\nremoval, and CAT relief, we have no jurisdiction to review that\n\ndecision.    Zhang v. INS, 348 F.3d 289, 292 (1st Cir. 2003).              Nor\n\ndid the motion to reconsider toll the time for filing a petition\n\nfor review of the BIA's original decision.             Id.\n\n            Although the BIA's denial of a motion to reconsider is\n\nseparately appealable, id., such a denial is reviewable only for an\n\nabuse of discretion, id. 293, \"meaning that it must be upheld\n\nunless it 'was made without a 'rational explanation, inexplicably\n\ndeparted from established policies, or rested on an impermissible\n\n\n\n\n                                     - 2 -\n\fbasis.'\"     Nascimento v.

The BIA's explanation for\n\ndenying     reconsideration--that    \"the    motion       merely    restate[d]\n\narguments presented before the Immigration Judge and on appeal\n\n. . . and presented no persuasive evidence or argument that [the\n\nBIA] committed error of law or fact in dismissing his appeal\"--is\n\nrational and consistent with BIA policy.        See 8 C.F.R. ยง 1003.2(b)\n\n(requiring that a motion to reconsider specify errors of fact or\n\nlaw in the BIA's original decision and be supported by pertinent\n\nauthority).     Petitioner does not allege that the BIA's original\n\ndecision rested on an impermissible basis, such as petitioner's\n\nrace.    Zhang, 348 F.3d at 293.     The order denying reconsideration\n\nalso    accurately   characterizes   the    motion   as    simply    restating\n\narguments previously made and failing to make any persuasive claims\n\nof error.\n\n            Consequently, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in\n\ndenying the motion for reconsideration, the only order that we have\n\njurisdiction to review.      Accordingly, the petition for review is\n\nsummarily denied.     1st Cir. R. 27.0(c).     Petitioner's motion for a\n\nstay of removal and respondent's motion to stay briefing are denied\n\nas moot.\n\n\n\n\n                                   - 3 -\n\f",
