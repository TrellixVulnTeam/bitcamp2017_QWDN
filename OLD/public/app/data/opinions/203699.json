RIVERA,\n\n                         Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n              [Hon. Nancy Gertner, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                     Torruella, Selya, and Lipez,\n                           Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Jane Elizabeth Lee on brief for appellant.\n     Jennifer H. Zacks, Assistant U.S. Attorney, and Michael J.\nSullivan, United States Attorney, on motion for summary\ndisposition.\n\n\n                            February 26, 2009\n\f            Per Curiam.     This is defendant's direct appeal from his\n\nsentence.    The sole issue that he raises is whether the district\n\ncourt underestimated the scope of its discretion--later clarified\n\nin Kimbrough v. United States, 128 S. Ct. 558 (2007), and United\n\nStates v. Boardman, 528 F.3d 86 (1st Cir. 2008)--to \"var[y] from\n\nthe Guidelines based solely on the judge's view that the Guidelines\n\nrange 'fails properly to reflect § 3553(a) considerations' even in\n\na mine-run case,\" Kimbrough, 128 S. Ct. at 575 (quoting Rita v.\n\nUnited States, 127 S. Ct. 2456, 2465 (2007)), and, in particular,\n\nto \"deviate from the guidelines . . . on the basis of categorical\n\npolicy disagreements\" with the career offender guideline, Boardman,\n\n528 F.3d at 87.      If so, then a remand for resentencing may be\n\nwarranted.    Moore v. United States, 129 S. Ct. 4, 5 (2008) (per\n\ncuriam); Boardman, 528 F.3d at 88.         Of course, the district court\n\nis free to clarify this point on remand.\n\n            A threshold question is whether defendant adequately\n\npreserved    this   issue   below,   which   determines   the   applicable\n\nstandard of appellate review.        We need not decide that question\n\nbecause the more demanding plain-error standard is satisfied here.\n\nThe record shows that the court felt powerless to disregard the\n\ncareer offender guideline on policy grounds in a \"mine-run case\"\n\nand also shows a \"reasonable probability\" that if the court had\n\nunderstood the full scope of its discretion, it would have imposed\n\na lesser sentence.     United States v. Matos, 531 F.3d 121, 122-23\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f(1st Cir.) (applying the \"reasonable probability\" standard to\n\nunpreserved Kimbrough errors), cert. denied, 2008 WL 4898432 (U.S.\n\nDec. 8, 2008).\n\n            Even after departing downward slightly on the ground that\n\ncounting    defendant's     juvenile     offenses   overrepresented   the\n\nseriousness of his criminal history, the court still felt that\n\ndefendant's sentence was \"way too long\" and that \"the Sentencing\n\nCommission picked these numbers out of the air, and . . . had no\n\nbasis for [them].\"    Yet, because it could not further distinguish\n\ndefendant from other career offenders, the court believed that it\n\ncould not vary below the already reduced guideline range without\n\ncreating an unwarranted sentencing disparity between defendant's\n\nsentence and those of other career offenders sentenced by other\n\njudges.\n\n            That view, though a correct statement of the law in this\n\ncircuit at the time, see United States v. Caraballo, 447 F.3d 26,\n\n27-28 (1st Cir. 2006), was rendered plainly erroneous by Kimbrough.\n\nIn particular, the Kimbrough Court expressly recognized that its\n\nholding    might   create   sentencing    disparity   between   similarly\n\nsituated defendants, depending on individual judges' differing\n\npolicy views, but characterized any such disparity as \"a necessary\n\ncost of the remedy . . . adopted [in United States v. Booker, 543\n\nU.S. 220 (2005)].\"    Kimbrough, 128 S. Ct. at 574.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\f           The district court's repeated characterization of the\n\nsentence imposed as \"too long\" further indicates that, had it\n\nunderstood the full scope of its discretion, it \"might well\" have\n\nimposed a lesser sentence.        United States v. Heldeman, 402 F.3d\n\n220, 224 (1st Cir. 2005).   We therefore remand the case to give the\n\ndistrict court an opportunity to resentence if and to whatever\n\nextent it deems appropriate in light of \"the additional latitude\n\nfurnished by Kimbrough.\"    Boardman, 528 F.3d at 88.\n\n           The matter is remanded to the district court for further\n\nproceedings   consistent   with   this   decision.   See   1st   Cir.   R.\n\n27.0(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\f",
