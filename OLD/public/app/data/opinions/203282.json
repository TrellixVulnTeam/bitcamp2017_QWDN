Pro se appellant Marcos Martínez-Medina\n\nappeals from the district court's denial of his motion to vacate\n\nhis sentence under 28 U.S.C. § 2255.          For reasons given below, we\n\naffirm.     On appeal, Martínez also raises new claims, which are\n\noutside the scope of the certificate of appealability (COA) granted\n\nby the district court.         As to such claims, we deny a COA.     We begin\n\nwith background.\n\n            I.    Background\n\n            In    1998,    Martínez    and   various      co-defendants     were\n\nconvicted of conspiring to possess with intent to distribute and\n\ndistribution of multi-kilograms of cocaine, heroin, and marijuana\n\nin violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and § 846.            At his sentencing\n\nhearing   in     1999,   the   district   court   found   that   Martínez   had\n\ncommitted certain murders in furtherance of the drug conspiracy, a\n\nfinding that significantly increased the applicable sentencing\n\nguideline range. Eventually, the court imposed the high end of the\n\nguideline range--a prison term of 405 months, or nearly 34 years.\n\nMartínez appealed, and his appeal was consolidated with appeals by\n\ntwo of his co-defendants.\n\n            On appeal, Martínez's appointed appellate attorney, who\n\nhad also been his trial attorney, challenged his conviction and\n\nsentence.      During the pendency of the appeal, Apprendi v. New\n\nJersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), was decided. In a supplemental brief,\n\ncounsel raised an Apprendi claim, alleging that Martínez's sentence\n\n                                      -2-\n\fhad   been    based   on   murders   that   were   neither   charged   in   the\n\nindictment nor determined by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nIn    her    brief,   however,   counsel    conceded    that   Martínez     was\n\nresponsible for more than 500 grams of cocaine and that the 40-year\n\nstatutory maximum in § 841(b)(1)(B) applied.\n\n              We affirmed Martínez's conviction and sentence.               We\n\nrejected his Apprendi and other sentencing claims, relying in part\n\non counsel's appellate concession that the statutory maximum was 40\n\nyears.       But before we turned to Martínez's Apprendi claim, we\n\ndiscussed a possible sentencing guideline error that we had noticed\n\nsua sponte--that the district court had not determined the specific\n\ndrug quantity attributable to Martínez.             We stated that, in the\n\nabsence of a quantity determination, the 20-year statutory maximum\n\nwould apply, and noted that Martínez had received a nearly 34-year\n\nsentence.1     But we suggested that any error had been forfeited or\n\n\n       1\n      As this court has emphasized both before and after Apprendi,\na sentencing court may not automatically attribute the conspiracy-\nwide drug quantity to an individual defendant for purposes of\nguideline sentencing, but must make an individualized determination\nof drug quantity. See United States v. Sepúlveda, 15 F.3d 1161,\n1197 (1st Cir. 1993) (stating that the guidelines require an\nindividualized determination of drug quantity); United States v.\nColón-Solis, 354 F.3d 101, 103 (1st Cir. 2004) (stating that this\ncourt has \"consistently . . . required a defendant-specific\ndetermination of drug quantity as a benchmark for individualized\nsentencing under the guidelines\").       In many drug cases, the\nindividualized finding of drug quantity will determine the\nappropriate base offense level under the drug guideline, § 2D1.1.\nPrior to Apprendi, it was also used to determine the appropriate\nstatutory maximum under § 841(b)(1). See United States v. Irvin,\n2 F.3d 72, 77-78 (4th Cir. 1993).\n     In Martínez's case, however, the base offense level was\n\n                                      -3-\n\fwaived--counsel had not objected to the lack of findings at the\n\nsentencing proceeding, and, on appeal, she had conceded to a higher\n\nmaximum.   At the same time, however, we observed that based on the\n\ntrial evidence, the district court \"would have had no difficulty\"\n\nfinding Martínez responsible for more than 500 grams of cocaine.\n\nSee United States v. Martínez-Medina, 279 F.3d 105, 125 & n.10 (1st\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 921 (2002).        In so doing, we\n\nessentially confirmed that the district court's apparent error and\n\ncounsel's failure to press for a specific drug amount finding were\n\nnot prejudicial since it was clear that the district court, if it\n\nhad addressed the issue, would have attributed at least 500 grams\n\nof cocaine to Martínez, thereby exposing him to a 40-year maximum,\n\nwhich exceeded the sentence he actually received.\n\n           Subsequently, Martínez's attorney urged him to file a §\n\n2255 motion alleging that she had rendered ineffective assistance\n\n\n\ndetermined under the murder guideline, § 2A.1.1, not the drug\nguideline.    Nonetheless, the district court, which sentenced\nMartínez pre-Apprendi, should still have made an individualized\ndrug finding so as to determine whether the murder-based guideline\nsentence was within the statutory maximum applicable to Martínez's\ndrug offense. See § 5G1.1(c) (permitting imposition of a guideline\nsentence only if it is within \"the statutorily authorized maximum\nsentence\" and \"any statutorily required minimum sentence\"); id.\n(commentary) (indicating that the statutory maximum is the one\n\"authorized by statute for the offense of conviction\").         For\nexample, if the district court had determined that no specific\nquantity of cocaine could be attributed to Martínez, then it could\nnot have imposed a guideline sentence of nearly 34 years on\nMartínez. At most, it could have imposed the 20-year statutory\nmaximum that applies to an offense involving an undetermined amount\nof cocaine.\n\n                                -4-\n\fof   counsel.    Based   apparently     in   part   on   what   was   a\n\nmisunderstanding of our appellate decision, she stated that she had\n\nmisconstrued Apprendi, that Apprendi required application of the\n\n20-year default maximum, and that she had erroneously conceded to\n\na 40-year statutory maximum.\n\n          In November 2002, Martínez filed the instant § 2255\n\nmotion and certain amendments.         He asserted Apprendi claims,\n\nalleging that his indictment had not charged him with murders or\n\nadequately stated a specific drug quantity and that the jury had\n\nnot made pertinent determinations either.       He also asserted an\n\nineffective assistance of counsel claim, relying on counsel's\n\nsuggestion that she had misconstrued Apprendi.      He contended that\n\nif counsel had not conceded to the 40-year statutory maximum, this\n\ncourt would have vacated his sentence on appeal on the ground that\n\nApprendi required application of the 20-year maximum.     Among other\n\nthings, Martínez noted that certain co-defendants of his, who had\n\nplayed a more significant role in the conspiracy, but who had been\n\nsentenced after Apprendi, had received sentences of 20 years on the\n\ndrug conspiracy count.\n\n          On February 7, 2006, the district court issued an Opinion\n\nand Order denying the § 2255 claims.   The court upheld a magistrate\n\njudge's report recommending that the claims be denied and also\n\noffered additional analysis.   Subsequently, it granted Martínez's\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\fapplication for a COA and his motion to proceed in forma pauperis\n\non appeal.\n\n           II.    Discussion\n\n           After careful consideration of Martínez's contentions, we\n\naffirm the district court's denial of the § 2255 motion, and we\n\ndeny a COA relative to Martínez's new appellate claims.      See 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2253(c)(2) (permitting a COA \"if the applicant has made a\n\nsubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\").\n\n           A.    The Apprendi Issues\n\n           1.    Drug Quantity\n\n           Martínez argues that his indictment was defective under\n\nApprendi because it did not adequately charge drug quantity.     He\n\nalso objects to the fact that the jury did not determine drug\n\nquantity and type as was subsequently required by Apprendi.      His\n\nclaims are unpersuasive for the following reasons.\n\n           First, Martínez fails to cite any case law to support his\n\nclaim that his indictment violated Apprendi.2    In pertinent part,\n\nthe indictment charged a conspiracy involving \"multi-kilograms\" of\n\ncocaine, which implied that it involved a minimum of 1 kilogram of\n\ncocaine.     In addition, the indictment specified a relevant overt\n\nact--that, in early 1996, approximately 2 kilograms of cocaine were\n\n\n\n     2\n      And we note that, in the direct appeal, the appellants did\nnot raise Apprendi claims challenging the adequacy of the drug\nquantity allegations in the indictment, and that we did not rule on\nthat question.\n\n                                  -6-\n\fdelivered to the drug point with which Martínez had allied himself.\n\nHence, taken together, the indictment allegations put Martínez on\n\nnotice that he could be subject to a 40-year statutory maximum.3\n\nSee United States v. Soto-Beníquez, 356 F.3d 1, 49 n.10 (1st Cir.\n\n2003) (stating that an indictment need not \"specify the exact\n\namount of drugs involved in the conspiracy, as long as it allege[s]\n\nthe   appropriate     threshold    amounts   necessary    to   support    the\n\ndefendants' sentences\"); 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B) (providing for a\n\n40-year maximum if the offense involves at least 500 grams of\n\ncocaine).\n\n                Next, it is true that there was Apprendi error because\n\nthe jury did not determine drug quantity.           But as we explained in\n\nrejecting the same Apprendi claim by Martínez's co-appellants, the\n\nerror     was   harmless   under   any   standard   of   review   since   the\n\noverwhelming trial evidence showed a conspiracy-wide drug quantity\n\nthat triggered a statutory maximum of life in prison.             Martínez-\n\nMedina, 279 F.3d at 122.       The same reasoning applies to Martínez\n\n\n\n      3\n      Because Martínez has not established that his indictment\nfailed to adequately allege drug quantity, his other arguments\npremised on that contention also fail. In any event, this panel\nwould be obliged to follow First Circuit precedent over conflicting\nprecedent from other circuits. E.g., United States v. González-\nVélez, 466 F.3d 27, 35 (1st Cir. 2006) (confirming this circuit's\nposition that drug quantity is not an element of a conspiracy crime\nunder 21 U.S.C. § 846).         In addition, the jurisdictional\nproposition that Martínez advocates is no longer valid. See United\nStates v. Cotton, 535 U.S. 625, 631 (2002) (overruling prior case\nlaw holding that a defective indictment deprives a court of\njurisdiction over the prosecution).\n\n                                     -7-\n\fbecause   he     was   found    guilty    of     participating      in   the   same\n\nconspiracy.     Id. at 113-15; United States v. Casas, 425 F.3d 23, 66\n\nn.58 (1st Cir. 2005) (emphasizing that, for Apprendi purposes, it\n\nis the drug quantity attributable to the entire conspiracy and not\n\nthe   quantity    attributable      to    the     individual    defendant      that\n\ndetermines the statutory maximum).\n\n           2.    The Murders\n\n           Since the trial evidence supported a statutory maximum of\n\nlife, Martínez had no viable Apprendi claim based on the district\n\ncourt's finding that he had committed certain murders that could be\n\nused to enhance his guideline sentence.             As of the time his appeal\n\nwas pending, Apprendi was deemed not to implicate “findings made\n\nfor   purposes    of   the     sentencing      guidelines,”    as   we   noted   in\n\nrejecting the same Apprendi claim by his co-appellants.                  Martínez-\n\nMedina, 279 F.3d at 122.\n\n           B.    Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n           Martínez contends that his appellate counsel rendered\n\nineffective assistance on appeal.                She allegedly misconstrued\n\nApprendi and so erroneously conceded that he was responsible for\n\nmore than 500 grams of cocaine and that a 40-year maximum applied.\n\nBut as discussed above, the statutory maximum based on the evidence\n\nas to the conspiracy-wide drug quantity was life.                    Accordingly,\n\ncounsel's appellate concession to the lower 40-year statutory\n\nmaximum, and her failure to argue for the even lower 20-year\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fdefault maximum, did not prejudice Martínez.4          Given the trial\n\nevidence and the state of the law at that time, Martínez could not\n\nhave obtained a reduced sentence on appeal based on Apprendi.\n\n          C.    The New Claims\n\n          In his appellate brief, Martínez raises new issues that\n\nwere not presented in his § 2255 motion or in his district court\n\napplication for a COA.     As to such issues, Martínez must show that\n\na COA is warranted.      We conclude that he has not done so.\n\n           Martínez argues that he should be resentenced consistent\n\nwith the 5-year default maximum for a marijuana offense.             He\n\ncontends that the jury might have convicted him for having been\n\ninvolved in marijuana transactions, but the trial transcripts\n\nprovide no factual support for his argument. Martínez also presses\n\na claim under United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005),\n\nrelative to the murder enhancement of his sentence.        His claim is\n\nforeclosed by our case law. \"This court has held that petitions\n\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 2255 are unavailable to advance Booker claims in\n\nthe   absence   of   a   Supreme   Court   decision   rendering   Booker\n\nretroactive.\"    United States v. Fraser, 407 F.3d 9, 11 (1st Cir.\n\n\n\n\n      4\n      We note as well that counsel did not render objectively\nunreasonable performance by adopting a position on appeal that was\nsupported by the trial evidence. As indicated in our appellate\nopinion, the evidence would readily have permitted a finding that\nover 500 grams of cocaine could be attributed to Martinez.\nMartínez-Medina, 279 F.3d at 125 n.10.\n\n                                   -9-\n\f2005) (citing Cirilo-Muñoz v. United States, 404 F.3d 527 (1st Cir.\n\n2005)).\n\n          We affirm the district court's judgment denying the\n\nmotion to vacate under 28 U.S.C. § 2255.   We deny a COA to appeal\n\nbased on new claims and terminate the appeal as to such claims.\n\n\n\n\n                               -10-\n\f",

At the same time, however, we observed that based on the\n\ntrial evidence, the district court \"would have had no difficulty\"\n\nfinding Martínez responsible for more than 500 grams of cocaine.\n\nSee United States v. Martínez-Medina, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776396\"><a href=\"/opinion/776396/united-states-v-marcos-martinez-medina-united-states-of-america-v-manuel/\"><span class=\"volume\">279</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 125 & n.10 (1st\n\nCir.), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">921</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2002).        In so doing, we\n\nessentially confirmed that the district court's apparent error and\n\ncounsel's failure to press for a specific drug amount finding were\n\nnot prejudicial since it was clear that the district court, if it\n\nhad addressed the issue, would have attributed at least 500 grams\n\nof cocaine to Martínez, thereby exposing him to a 40-year maximum,\n\nwhich exceeded the sentence he actually received.\n\n           Subsequently, Martínez's attorney urged him to file a §\n\n2255 motion alleging that she had rendered ineffective assistance\n\n\n\ndetermined under the murder guideline, § 2A.1.1, not the drug\nguideline.    Nonetheless, the district court, which sentenced\nMartínez pre-Apprendi, should still have made an individualized\ndrug finding so as to determine whether the murder-based guideline\nsentence was within the statutory maximum applicable to Martínez's\ndrug offense. See § 5G1.1(c) (permitting imposition of a guideline\nsentence only if it is within \"the statutorily authorized maximum\nsentence\" and \"any statutorily required minimum sentence\"); id.\n(commentary) (indicating that the statutory maximum is the one\n\"authorized by statute for the offense of conviction\").         For\nexample, if the district court had determined that no specific\nquantity of cocaine could be attributed to Martínez, then it could\nnot have imposed a guideline sentence of nearly 34 years on\nMartínez. At most, it could have imposed the 20-year statutory\nmaximum that applies to an offense involving an undetermined amount\nof cocaine.\n\n                                -4-\n\fof   counsel.    Based   apparently     in   part   on   what   was   a\n\nmisunderstanding of our appellate decision, she stated that she had\n\nmisconstrued Apprendi, that Apprendi required application of the\n\n20-year default maximum, and that she had erroneously conceded to\n\na 40-year statutory maximum.\n\n          In November 2002, Martínez filed the instant § 2255\n\nmotion and certain amendments.         He asserted Apprendi claims,\n\nalleging that his indictment had not charged him with murders or\n\nadequately stated a specific drug quantity and that the jury had\n\nnot made pertinent determinations either.       He also asserted an\n\nineffective assistance of counsel claim, relying on counsel's\n\nsuggestion that she had misconstrued Apprendi.      He contended that\n\nif counsel had not conceded to the 40-year statutory maximum, this\n\ncourt would have vacated his sentence on appeal on the ground that\n\nApprendi required application of the 20-year maximum.     Among other\n\nthings, Martínez noted that certain co-defendants of his, who had\n\nplayed a more significant role in the conspiracy, but who had been\n\nsentenced after Apprendi, had received sentences of 20 years on the\n\ndrug conspiracy count.\n\n          On February 7, 2006, the district court issued an Opinion\n\nand Order denying the § 2255 claims.   The court upheld a magistrate\n\njudge's report recommending that the claims be denied and also\n\noffered additional analysis.   Subsequently, it granted Martínez's\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\fapplication for a COA and his motion to proceed in forma pauperis\n\non appeal.\n\n           II.    Discussion\n\n           After careful consideration of Martínez's contentions, we\n\naffirm the district court's denial of the § 2255 motion, and we\n\ndeny a COA relative to Martínez's new appellate claims.      See 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2253(c)(2) (permitting a COA \"if the applicant has made a\n\nsubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\").\n\n           A.    The Apprendi Issues\n\n           1.    Drug Quantity\n\n           Martínez argues that his indictment was defective under\n\nApprendi because it did not adequately charge drug quantity.     He\n\nalso objects to the fact that the jury did not determine drug\n\nquantity and type as was subsequently required by Apprendi.      His\n\nclaims are unpersuasive for the following reasons.\n\n           First, Martínez fails to cite any case law to support his\n\nclaim that his indictment violated Apprendi.2    In pertinent part,\n\nthe indictment charged a conspiracy involving \"multi-kilograms\" of\n\ncocaine, which implied that it involved a minimum of 1 kilogram of\n\ncocaine.     In addition, the indictment specified a relevant overt\n\nact--that, in early 1996, approximately 2 kilograms of cocaine were\n\n\n\n     2\n      And we note that, in the direct appeal, the appellants did\nnot raise Apprendi claims challenging the adequacy of the drug\nquantity allegations in the indictment, and that we did not rule on\nthat question.\n\n                                  -6-\n\fdelivered to the drug point with which Martínez had allied himself.\n\nHence, taken together, the indictment allegations put Martínez on\n\nnotice that he could be subject to a 40-year statutory maximum.3\n\nSee United States v. Soto-Beníquez, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">356</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 49 n.10 (1st Cir.\n\n2003) (stating that an indictment need not \"specify the exact\n\namount of drugs involved in the conspiracy, as long as it allege[s]\n\nthe   appropriate     threshold    amounts   necessary    to   support    the\n\ndefendants' sentences\"); 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B) (providing for a\n\n40-year maximum if the offense involves at least 500 grams of\n\ncocaine).\n\n                Next, it is true that there was Apprendi error because\n\nthe jury did not determine drug quantity.           But as we explained in\n\nrejecting the same Apprendi claim by Martínez's co-appellants, the\n\nerror     was   harmless   under   any   standard   of   review   since   the\n\noverwhelming trial evidence showed a conspiracy-wide drug quantity\n\nthat triggered a statutory maximum of life in prison.             Martínez-\n\nMedina, 279 F.3d at 122.       The same reasoning applies to Martínez\n\n\n\n      3\n      Because Martínez has not established that his indictment\nfailed to adequately allege drug quantity, his other arguments\npremised on that contention also fail. In any event, this panel\nwould be obliged to follow First Circuit precedent over conflicting\nprecedent from other circuits. E.g., United States v. González-\nVélez, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 35 (1st Cir. 2006) (confirming this circuit's\nposition that drug quantity is not an element of a conspiracy crime\nunder 21 U.S.C. § 846).         In addition, the jurisdictional\nproposition that Martínez advocates is no longer valid. See United\nStates v. Cotton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118505\"><a href=\"/opinion/118505/united-states-v-cotton/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">625</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 631 (2002) (overruling prior case\nlaw holding that a defective indictment deprives a court of\njurisdiction over the prosecution).\n\n                                     -7-\n\fbecause   he     was   found    guilty    of     participating      in   the   same\n\nconspiracy.

Casas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792073\"><a href=\"/opinion/792073/united-states-v-angel-casas-united-states-of-america-v-jose/\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 66\n\nn.58 (1st Cir. 2005) (emphasizing that, for Apprendi purposes, it\n\nis the drug quantity attributable to the entire conspiracy and not\n\nthe   quantity    attributable      to    the     individual    defendant      that\n\ndetermines the statutory maximum).\n\n           2.    The Murders\n\n           Since the trial evidence supported a statutory maximum of\n\nlife, Martínez had no viable Apprendi claim based on the district\n\ncourt's finding that he had committed certain murders that could be\n\nused to enhance his guideline sentence.             As of the time his appeal\n\nwas pending, Apprendi was deemed not to implicate “findings made\n\nfor   purposes    of   the     sentencing      guidelines,”    as   we   noted   in\n\nrejecting the same Apprendi claim by his co-appellants.                  Martínez-\n\nMedina, 279 F.3d at 122.\n\n           B.    Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n           Martínez contends that his appellate counsel rendered\n\nineffective assistance on appeal.                She allegedly misconstrued\n\nApprendi and so erroneously conceded that he was responsible for\n\nmore than 500 grams of cocaine and that a 40-year maximum applied.\n\nBut as discussed above, the statutory maximum based on the evidence\n\nas to the conspiracy-wide drug quantity was life.                    Accordingly,\n\ncounsel's appellate concession to the lower 40-year statutory\n\nmaximum, and her failure to argue for the even lower 20-year\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fdefault maximum, did not prejudice Martínez.4          Given the trial\n\nevidence and the state of the law at that time, Martínez could not\n\nhave obtained a reduced sentence on appeal based on Apprendi.\n\n          C.    The New Claims\n\n          In his appellate brief, Martínez raises new issues that\n\nwere not presented in his § 2255 motion or in his district court\n\napplication for a COA.     As to such issues, Martínez must show that\n\na COA is warranted.      We conclude that he has not done so.\n\n           Martínez argues that he should be resentenced consistent\n\nwith the 5-year default maximum for a marijuana offense.             He\n\ncontends that the jury might have convicted him for having been\n\ninvolved in marijuana transactions, but the trial transcripts\n\nprovide no factual support for his argument. Martínez also presses\n\na claim under United States v. Booker, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2005),\n\nrelative to the murder enhancement of his sentence.        His claim is\n\nforeclosed by our case law. \"This court has held that petitions\n\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 2255 are unavailable to advance Booker claims in\n\nthe   absence   of   a   Supreme   Court   decision   rendering   Booker\n\nretroactive.\"    United States v.
