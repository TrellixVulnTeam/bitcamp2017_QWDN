Petitioner    Carlos   Ramon     Paez-Rodriguez\n\n(\"Paez\") seeks review of the June 2, 2004, final order of removal\n\nissued by the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"Board\") affirming the\n\nimmigration judge's decision.     Paez is a citizen of the Dominican\n\nRepublic who overstayed a non-immigrant visa.                Paez does not\n\ncontest removability; what he objects to is the refusal of the\n\nimmigration judge and the Board to continue the removal proceeding\n\nso that he could pursue alternative relief.\n\n           Paez entered this country in 1994, and in 1997, Paez and\n\nhis wife Mary Luz Lopez applied for permanent residency for Paez\n\nbased on his marriage to a U.S. citizen.        On July 24, 2000, the INS\n\ndenied the application because Paez had in 1999 failed to respond\n\nto the INS's request that he be fingerprinted.          The INS initiated\n\nremoval proceedings on April 26, 2002.\n\n           On February 13, 2003, after a delay to permit Paez to\n\nobtain   counsel,   Paez   indicated    his    intent   to   apply   for   an\n\nadjustment of status based on his marriage to a U.S. citizen.              By\n\nthis time it appears that Paez and his wife were contemplating a\n\ndivorce,   but   the   immigration     judge    nevertheless    granted     a\n\ncontinuance to allow Paez to submit evidence that his spouse had\n\nsubmitted or re-submitted a visa petition on his behalf.                   On\n\nFebruary 21, a further continuance was granted, Paez being directed\n\nto submit proof of a visa application by March 10.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\f           Paez never submitted the application.                Instead, on April\n\n10, 2003, his counsel explained that Paez' wife was unwilling to\n\nsign a visa application but that Paez was now seeking through his\n\nemployer a labor certification to support a visa application, and\n\nhe    requested    a   further     continuance      to   pursue     this    effort.\n\nAccepting the government's argument that this route should have\n\nbeen pursued at an earlier time, the immigration judge denied the\n\ncontinuance \"under the circumstances of the case.\"\n\n            On    April    17,    2003,    Paez's   counsel      again     sought   a\n\ncontinuance for Paez to pursue the labor certification, filing with\n\nthe    immigration        court   a   recently      completed       certification\n\napplication.      The immigration judge \"reaffirm[ed]\" her denial of\n\nthe continuance,       noting     that    there   was    no    evidence    that   the\n\napplication had actually been filed and that it had in any event\n\nbeen prepared only two days before.             Paez appealed from the denial\n\nof the continuance to the Board, which summarily affirmed pursuant\n\nto 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(4) (2004).\n\n            Paez now appeals from the denial of his motion for a\n\ncontinuance, asserting that it was a violation of his due process\n\nrights in addition to an abuse of discretion.                 He also asserts that\n\nthe Board erred by summarily affirming rather than having a full\n\npanel review his case.            We note without resolving a threshold\n\nobjection by the government and deny the petition for review on the\n\nmerits.\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\f           The   government   at   the    outset     asserts    that    we   lack\n\njurisdiction to review the immigration judge's denial of the motion\n\nfor continuance because of 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B) (2000), which\n\nstates:\n\n           Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no\n           court shall have jurisdiction to review -- . .\n           . (ii) any other decision or action of the\n           Attorney General the authority for which is\n           specified under this subchapter to be in the\n           discretion of the Attorney General.\n\nThe government argues that immigration judges conducting removal\n\nproceedings    are   exercising    the    Attorney       General's   powers    by\n\ndelegation, and it notes that 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29 (2004) says that\n\nthe \"immigration judge may grant a motion for continuance for good\n\ncause shown.\" (emphasis supplied).\n\n           At least two circuit courts share the government's view.\n\nSee, e.g., Yerkovic v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 990, 995 (10th Cir.\n\n2004); Onyinkwa v. Ashcroft, 376 F.3d 797, 799 (8th Cir. 2004).               On\n\nthe other hand, one could argue about whether the rule's grant of\n\ndiscretion to the immigration judge is a matter \"which is specified\n\nunder   this   subchapter\"    to   be    within    the    Attorney     General's\n\ndiscretion, given that the grant or denial of continuances in\n\nremoval proceedings is not listed as a discretionary decision in\n\nthe statute.     See Medina-Morales v. Ashcroft, 371 F.3d 520, 528\n\n(9th Cir. 2004).     Contra 8 U.S.C. § 1184(d) (2000) (providing that\n\nthe \"Attorney General in his discretion\" may waive a particular\n\nvisa requirement).\n\n                                    -4-\n\f              In any event the outcome in this case is effectively the\n\nsame regardless of whether we have authority to review the denial\n\nof   a   continuance,          because      the     denial      was     not    an     abuse   of\n\ndiscretion--let alone a denial of due process.                                 Steel Co. v.\n\nCitizens for        a    Better       Environment,        523    U.S.    83,    101    (1998),\n\nrequiring     us    to        assure   ourselves      that       we     have    Article       III\n\njurisdiction, does not require that we resolve the threshold\n\nquestion; the government's objection goes only to our statutory\n\nauthority to review a specific class of decisions.                               Restoration\n\nPreservation Masonry, Inc. v. Grove Europe Ltd., 325 F.3d 54, 60\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).\n\n              Under an abuse-of-discretion standard, this is not a\n\nclose case.     Paez had to know from the start that his prospects in\n\nthe removal proceeding for obtaining a visa based on marriage were\n\ndoubtful.      Yet between February and mid-April 2003, he did not\n\npursue    a   labor      certification.             Although      Paez        says    that    the\n\nimmigration        judge       gave    no   reason        for    refusing       the    initial\n\ncontinuance for this purpose, in context it is apparent that she\n\naccepted the government's argument of undue delay.\n\n              When Paez renewed the request on April 17, he still had\n\nnot actually filed a visa application based on a labor certificate\n\n(and     he   may       not    have    even       filed    the    labor        certification\n\napplication).       Contra Matter of Garcia, 16 I & N Dec. 653, 657 (BIA\n\n1978), quoted in Oluyemi v. INS, 902 F.2d 1032, 1034 (1st Cir.\n\n\n                                              -5-\n\f1990) (continuance encouraged when an alien has submitted a \"prima\n\nfacie approvable visa petition\").              Yet the alien must first submit\n\nand have approved a labor certification application, then submit a\n\nvisa petition based on the labor certification; only once that is\n\napproved is the alien eligible for permanent residency, see United\n\nStates v. Ryan-Webster, 353 F.3d 353, 356 (4th Cir. 2003).\n\n          Finally,        we    reject      Paez's   contention   that   summary\n\naffirmance     in   his        case   was      improper   under   8   C.F.R.   §\n\n1003.1(a)(7)(ii), (e)(4)(i), (e)(6). Whatever the reviewability of\n\nthe decision to act summarily, this case posed a fact-specific\n\nprocedural matter and involved no new legal issues.\n\n             The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\f",

Yet the alien must first submit\n\nand have approved a labor certification application, then submit a\n\nvisa petition based on the labor certification; only once that is\n\napproved is the alien eligible for permanent residency, see United\n\nStates v.
