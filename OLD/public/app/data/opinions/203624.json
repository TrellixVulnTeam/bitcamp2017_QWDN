This is defendant's direct appeal from his\n\nconviction by a jury for bank robbery.          The sole issue that he\n\nraises on appeal is whether the government presented sufficient\n\nevidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was the one who\n\nrobbed the bank. The government has moved for summary disposition.\n\nFor   the   reason   discussed    below--namely,   that   the   government\n\nproduced sufficient evidence, albeit entirely circumstantial, from\n\nwhich the jury could reasonably conclude that defendant was the\n\nbank robber--we summarily affirm the conviction.\n\n            Where,   as   here,   defendant   preserves   a     sufficiency\n\nchallenge, we review the sufficiency of the evidence de novo.\n\nUnited States v. Piesak, 521 F.3d 41, 44 (1st Cir. 2008).              Our\n\nreview, however, is highly deferential to the jury's verdict,\n\nUnited States v. García-Ortiz, 528 F.3d 74, 83 (1st Cir.), cert.\n\ndenied, 129 S. Ct. 254 (2008); we take the evidence in the light\n\nmost favorable to the government and decide only whether the\n\ngovernment has met its burden of producing evidence that \"would\n\npermit a rational trier of fact to find each element of the crime[]\n\ncharged beyond a reasonable doubt.\"       United States v. Santana, 175\n\nF.3d 57, 62 (1st Cir. 1999).       The government can meet this burden\n\nby circumstantial evidence alone, United States v. Rodríguez-Durán,\n\n507 F.3d 749, 758 (1st Cir. 2007), cert. denied, 128 S. Ct. 1726\n\n(2008), and \"need not disprove every hypothesis consistent with the\n\ndefendant's innocence; rather, it is enough that 'a rational jury\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fcould look objectively at the proof and supportably conclude beyond\n\na   reasonable     doubt     that   the      defendant's     guilt     has   been\n\nestablished.'\"     Santana, 175 F.3d at 62 (quoting United States v.\n\nIngraham, 832 F.2d 229, 240 (1st Cir. 1987)).\n\n           Among the elements that the government must prove in\n\nevery case is the identity of the defendant as the person who\n\ncommitted the charged crime.        United States v. Ayala, 289 F.3d 16,\n\n25 (1st Cir. 2002).          However, evidence of that element, like\n\nevidence   of    any   other,    can   be     entirely     circumstantial;      no\n\ntestimonial or physical evidence establishing the perpetrator's\n\nidentity is required.        United States v. Lugo Guerrero, 524 F.3d 5,\n\n12-13 (1st Cir. 2008); Santana, 175 F.3d at 62; United States v.\n\nDoherty, 867 F.2d 47, 67 (1st Cir. 1989); United States v. Brown,\n\n603 F.2d 1022, 1024 (1st Cir. 1979).            Indeed, the absence of eye-\n\nwitness identification of a robber is entirely understandable\n\nwhere, as here, the witnesses testified that the robber was wearing\n\na disguise (here, a wig and dark sunglasses).            See United States v.\n\nHaywood, 363 F.3d 200, 205 (3d Cir. 2004); United States v.\n\nDittrich, 100 F.3d 84, 86 (8th Cir. 1996); United States v. Tilmon,\n\n19 F.3d 1221, 1229 (7th Cir. 1994).\n\n           Under those standards, it is rare for a sufficiency\n\nchallenge to succeed, United States v. Ortiz, 447 F.3d 28, 32 (1st\n\nCir. 2006), and this case is no exception.               Rather, as detailed\n\nbelow,   the    government    presented      ample   evidence   from    which    a\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\frational jury could reasonably conclude that defendant was the one\n\nwho   robbed      the    bank   and   could       reasonably   reject   defendant's\n\nalternative theory that the offense was committed by another\n\nunidentified individual who carjacked him and forced him to drive\n\nto the bank and then in the high-speed chase that followed the\n\nrobbery.\n\n              The evidence supporting defendant's identity as the bank\n\nrobber included:\n\n              !    Two bank tellers' descriptions of the robber as a\n\nblack male about six feet tall and weighing about 200 pounds\n\nmatched defendant's description of himself as six feet, one inch\n\ntall and weighing between 210 and 215 pounds.\n\n              !     The    get-away    car    was     registered   at   defendant's\n\naddress, and defendant admitted that he was driving it before and\n\nafter the robbery.\n\n              ! A bank employee testified that he saw only one person-\n\n-the robber--enter the driver's side of the get-away car and drive\n\naway,   and       that    employee    and    two    witnesses   who     observed   or\n\nparticipated in the high-speed chase also testified that they saw\n\nonly one person in the get-away car, the driver.\n\n              !    An observer testified that he saw items being tossed\n\nfrom the get-away car.          The stolen money and the wig, sunglasses,\n\nshirt, and gun meeting the tellers' description of those worn or\n\nused by the robber were found on and next to the roads traveled\n\n\n                                            -4-\n\fduring the high-speed chase. Rubber gloves meeting the description\n\nof those worn by the robber and stained with red dye matching the\n\ncolor of the red-dye pack that a teller included with the stolen\n\nmoney were found under the driver's side of the car where it was\n\neventually abandoned; and a pair of pants with a red-dye stain was\n\nalso found not far from the abandoned car.\n\n           In his opening statement and closing argument, defense\n\ncounsel posited, based primarily on a statement that defendant gave\n\nto the police at booking, that defendant was an innocent victim of\n\nan unidentified carjacker, who committed the robbery and then\n\nforced   defendant   to   drive   the    get-away   car   while   he   (the\n\ncarjacker/robber) crouched below the dashboard on the passenger\n\nside of the car. This alternative scenario conflicts not only with\n\nthe evidence discussed above--that defendant's physical description\n\nmatches that of the robber and that the defendant was the only\n\nperson seen in the car by those who had an opportunity to look--but\n\nalso with defendant's own story at the time that he was initially\n\napprehended--that he was merely jogging.\n\n           In its opening and closing, the government pointed out\n\nthese and other weaknesses in defendant's story, but it was not the\n\ngovernment's burden \"to exclude every reasonable hypothesis of\n\ninnocence advanced by the defense.\"         United States v. Page, 521\n\nF.3d 101, 108 (1st Cir. 2008).      Even if defendant's theory was a\n\nplausible inference from the evidence, the jury apparently chose to\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fbelieve the prosecutor's version instead.                    Moreover, they did so\n\neven after being instructed by the court that \"[o]ne of the most\n\nimportant       issues    in    this   case     is   the   identification    of   the\n\ndefendant as the perpetrator of the crime charged\" and that \"[i]f\n\n[they]    are    not     convinced     beyond    a    reasonable   doubt   that   the\n\ndefendant was the person who committed the crime charged, [they]\n\nmust find the defendant not guilty.\"                 That choice was for the jury,\n\nwho \"may reject even a 'reasonable hypothesis inconsistent with\n\nguilt,'     so    long     as    the   evidence       also    reasonably    supports\n\nculpability,\" Rodríguez-Durán, 507 F.3d at 759 (quoting United\n\nStates v. Guerrero-Guerrero, 776 F.2d 1071, 1075 (1st Cir. 1985)),\n\nwhich the evidence does here.\n\n            In sum, because a rational jury could have found the\n\nevidence adequate to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that\n\ndefendant was the one who robbed the bank, defendant's conviction\n\nis summarily affirmed.           1st Cir. R. 27.0(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\f",

Even if defendant's theory was a\n\nplausible inference from the evidence, the jury apparently chose to\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fbelieve the prosecutor's version instead.                    Moreover, they did so\n\neven after being instructed by the court that \"[o]ne of the most\n\nimportant       issues    in    this   case     is   the   identification    of   the\n\ndefendant as the perpetrator of the crime charged\" and that \"[i]f\n\n[they]    are    not     convinced     beyond    a    reasonable   doubt   that   the\n\ndefendant was the person who committed the crime charged, [they]\n\nmust find the defendant not guilty.\"                 That choice was for the jury,\n\nwho \"may reject even a 'reasonable hypothesis inconsistent with\n\nguilt,'     so    long     as    the   evidence       also    reasonably    supports\n\nculpability,\" Rodríguez-Durán, 507 F.3d at 759 (quoting United\n\nStates v.
