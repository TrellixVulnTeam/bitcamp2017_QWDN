Sullivan, United States Attorney, Christopher F.\nBator, Assistant United States Attorney, and Elizabeth D. Collery,\nAttorney, Appellate Section, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                            January 22, 2004\n\f             Per Curiam.         Jeffrey North appeals his conviction and\n\nforty-five        year   sentence      for    drug     trafficking     and     weapons\n\nviolations.       We affirm.\n\n          The        indictment        charged       North   with    one   count    of\n\nconspiracy to possess with intent to distribute large quantities\n\nof marijuana, two counts of illegal possession of weapons, and one\n\ncount of illegal \"use and carry\" of weapons in relation to the\n\ncharged drug conspiracy.            North's co-defendant, Regina Monaghan,\n\nwas jointly charged in the drug conspiracy and, in a separate\n\ncount, also charged with money laundering.\n\n             At    the   close    of    a    seventeen-day     joint    jury     trial,\n\nMonaghan was acquitted.            North was convicted of all the charges\n\nagainst him.       He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of forty-\n\nfive years.\n\n              The evidence against North included the testimony of\n\n three   witnesses        who    each       headed    his    own    (separate)     drug\n\n distribution ring:         Starita, Stevens and Petraglia.                  Petraglia\n\n initially had assisted Stevens, becoming a separate supplier to\n\n North when Stevens left town.                Each supplier-witness testified\n\n in detail that on multiple occasions he supplied to North very\n\n large (wholesale) quantities of marijuana in exchange for North's\n\n payment of large amounts of cash.                 During each transaction, North\n\n re-wrapped the drugs that he purchased in a unique fashion in the\n\n supplier's presence.            Each supplier also testified that North\n\n\n                                             -2-\n\fcarried, displayed and/or brandished various firearms during the\n\ntransactions.    The suppliers' testimony was corroborated by other\n\nwitnesses who had played lesser roles in the deals, including\n\nAdams   (who   assisted      in   transactions   with     both   Stevens   and\n\nPetraglia),    Rosa   (who    helped    Stevens),   and    Butler   (who   was\n\nNorth's driver and who witnessed, inter alia, North's purchase\n\nof weapons and his resale of drugs).\n\n           North's connection to the weapons identified by the\n\nsuppliers also was corroborated by the testimony of one Regan.\n\nRegan testified that he and other members of the \"DeCologero\n\ngang\" had stolen firearms from North's apartment, including the\n\nmachine gun, silencer, UZI and ammunition charged to North in the\n\nindictment.     The robbers had stashed some of the stolen weapons\n\nin the apartment of a young woman, Aislin Silva.                 A search of\n\nAislin Silva's apartment by the ATF in November 1996, revealed\n\nthe guns, which were duly seized.            Others of North's weapons\n\napparently ended up in a marsh where they were found in February\n\n1997.\n\n           North testified in his own defense, denying almost\n\nevery one of the government witnesses' incriminating allegations.\n\nIn turn, North accused his accusers of engaging in a perjurious\n\neffort to frame him for their own drug dealing and falsely to\n\nattribute to him control or possession of weapons that the\n\naccusers had used in connection with their own drug activities.\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fOther incriminating physical evidence found by the police among\n\nNorth's       possessions,       North     said,    actually    belonged      to   the\n\ngovernment       witnesses.         Still,       North   admitted     that    he   was\n\nacquainted with all of the drug-dealer witnesses (testifying that\n\nhe    worked    as    a    pet/house-sitter        for   Stevens);    that    he   had\n\nillegally purchased other drugs (steroids for personal use); and\n\nthat he had participated in at least one theft of money from one\n\nof the drug suppliers.\n\n                North's testimonial protestations of innocence were\n\nseverely impeached on cross-examination by proof of his own\n\ninconsistent         out-of-court         admissions     in    (1)    tape-recorded\n\ntelephone calls that he made from state prison to government\n\nwitnesses, and (2) a statement that he made in a proffer session\n\nafter his arrest.            In an effort to blunt the impeaching effect,\n\nNorth asserted at trial that his taped telephonic comments did\n\nnot    mean    what       they   seemed    to    mean,   and   that   the    pretrial\n\nstatement he had proffered to the government was filled with\n\nlies.\n\n               North was represented by counsel at trial.                    In mid-\n\ntrial, he moved for permission to proceed pro se.                      That motion\n\nwas denied.          After the trial, he was permitted to represent\n\nhimself at sentencing, although the court also appointed standby\n\ncounsel for him.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\f            On appeal, North initially chose to proceed pro se.              He\n\nthen changed his mind and moved for appointment of counsel.                That\n\nmotion was granted.            He then reversed field once again, and\n\ninsisted upon appearing pro se.            He persisted in that position\n\nnotwithstanding this court's stern warning about the difficulties\n\nhe likely would face if he chose to proceed without counsel on\n\nappeal.     We ultimately granted his renewed motion to appear pro\n\nse.\n\n            North's brief presents ten labeled points.            Each point\n\nincludes a number of sub-points.           Almost all of the issues are\n\nvaguely or imprecisely framed.        In light of his pro se status, we\n\ninterpret    his   arguments     liberally,    gleaning,   by   subject,    the\n\nfollowing sets of issues.\n\n            I.     THE CONSPIRACY CHARGE\n\n            North argues that there were a number of variances\n\nbetween the evidence adduced at trial and the conspiracy charged\n\nin Count Three of the superseding indictment.              As a result, he\n\nurges   that     there   was    insufficient    evidence   to   support     his\n\nconviction on Counts Three and Four.           Count Three charges:\n\n            From in or about March, 1996 to in or about\n            February,   1999,   at  Stoneham,   Tewksbury,\n            Melrose and elsewhere in the District of\n            Massachusetts, and elsewhere . . . . Jeffrey\n            North and Regina Monaghan. . . . defendants\n            herein,   did   knowingly  and   intentionally\n            combine, conspire, confederate and agree with\n            each other, and with other persons known and\n            unknown to the Grand Jury, to possess with\n            intent to distribute marijuana. . . . in\n\n                                     -5-\n\f           violation of Title 21, United States Code,\n           Section 841(a)(1) . . . . [and] Section 846.\n\n           Count Four is dependent on Count Three.                 Count Four\n\ncharges that North \"used\" and \"carried\"             specifically identified\n\nweapons \"during and in relation to the drug trafficking crime\n\nalleged in Count Three . . .\"\n\n           A.     \"Single\" vs. \"Multiple\" Conspiracies\n\n           Below, all parties agreed that Count Three charged a\n\n\"single\" conspiracy.      The defense objected that the government's\n\nevidence varied from the charge by instead indicating at least two\n\nseparate   conspiracies   between     North   and    his   competing   supply\n\nsources:   one conspiracy between North and the distribution ring\n\nof Stevens/Adams/Rosa (and possibly Petraglia), and the other\n\nconspiracy exclusively between North and Starita.1             There was no\n\ninterdependence among the competing sources, nor proof even of an\n\nawareness of the other suppliers by Starita, according to the\n\ndefense.     In   opposition,   the    government      contended    that   the\n\n\n\n     1\n      The defense also argued, and North echos here, that the one\nand     only    conspiracy      properly    noticed     was     the\nStevens/Adams/Rosa/Petraglia conspiracy since Starita's testimony\nhad been insufficiently noticed.         As framed, the argument\nimplicates both Count Three and Count Four (as the proof that North\nhad \"used and carried\" some of the weapons identified in Count Four\nhad come largely from Starita's testimony about guns brandished\nduring the Starita/North transactions). This argument is belied by\nthe record. While Starita's name initially was omitted from a bill\nof particulars that named the other conspirators, notice of\nStarita's testimony was given approximately two and one-half weeks\nbefore the start of trial. The timing and manner of the notice was\nnot shown to have caused any separate prejudice to the defense.\n\n                                    -6-\n\fevidence proved that North was the \"hub\" of a single conspiracy\n\nto acquire marijuana from multiple sources of supply.                 These\n\nsources necessarily substituted for or supplemented one another\n\nfrom North's point of view.\n\n         The court correctly submitted this issue to the jury. The\n\ncourt charged -- as to each defendant -- that the jury should\n\ndetermine whether the evidence showed one \"overall\" conspiracy or\n\nseparate conspiracies, and \"if you believe the evidence shows that\n\neither defendant was a member of a conspiracy different from the\n\none charged in the indictment, then you must find him or her not\n\nguilty. . . \"\n\n             As raised on appeal, North's attack poses three sub-\n\nquestions:\n\n            (1) Is the evidence sufficient to permit a\n            jury to find the (express or tacit) agreement\n            that the indictment charges? (2) If not, is\n            it sufficient to permit a jury, under a\n            proper set of instructions, to convict the\n            defendant of a related, similar conspiracy?\n            (3) If so, does the variance affect the\n            defendants substantial rights or does the\n            difference between the charged conspiracy and\n            the conspiracy proved amount to \"harmless\n            error?\"\n\nUnited States v. Glenn, 828 F.2d 855, 857-58 (1st Cir. 1987); see\n\nalso United States v. Sutherland, 929 F.2d 765, 772 (1st Cir.\n\n1991).\n\n            (1)     Sufficiency   of    the   evidence.     We   review   the\n\nsufficiency    of   the   evidence     to   prove   the   charged   \"single\"\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fconspiracy in the light most favorable to the verdict.                       United\n\nStates v. Wihbey, 75 F.3d 761, 774 (1st Cir. 1996).                          Courts\n\nusually look for proof of factors such as (1) a \"common goal,\" (2)\n\ninterdependence among the participants, and (3) overlap among\n\nparticipants.      United States v. Portela, 167 F.3d 687, 694 (1st\n\nCir. 1999); cf. United States v. Shea, 211 F.3d 658, 665 (1st Cir.\n\n2000) (observing that \"no magic formula exists for determining\n\nwhen a set of jointly committed crimes adds up to an overarching\n\nconspiracy or enterprise,\" but courts \"tend to look\" for the\n\nlisted factors).\n\n            The evidence is overwhelmingly sufficient to prove, as\n\nthe prosecution urged, that North was the hub of an enterprise\n\nthat obtained drugs from multiple drug supplier-spokes.                         All\n\nparticipants thus had as a \"common goal\" an interest in selling\n\nmarijuana for a profit.         See Portela, 167 F.3d at 694 (reasoning\n\n\"that     each    defendant     had    an    interest      in     furthering   the\n\ndistribution of [drugs] is also sufficient evidence that they\n\nshared a common goal with the other participants\").                     Proof of\n\nNorth's     own    \"pervasive     involvement\"       as     the    \"single     core\n\nconspirator\"      also   sufficed     to     show   an    \"overlap\"    among    the\n\nparticipants.      Id. at 695.        There also was ample proof to imply\n\nan \"interdependence\" among the participants.\n\n            (2)     Similar Conspiracies.           Even if the evidence is\n\nviewed as proving more than one conspiracy, each of them would fit\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fwithin    the   indictment's         charge      --     and   each    was    sufficiently\n\nproven.\n\n            There was overwhelming proof of a pattern of large\n\nquantity sales between North and each of his supply sources,\n\nsufficient to permit a jury to find an implicit, if not explicit,\n\nagreement that each supplier would be a continuing source of\n\nsupply for North's resale efforts.                    See United States v. Moran,\n\n984 F.2d 1299, 1303 (1st Cir. 1993) (explaining that a continuing\n\ncourse of dealing between buyer and seller suggests the shared\n\npurpose,    knowledge        and    interdependence           necessary      to   prove     a\n\nconspiracy      between      them).            And,   viewing       each    source     as   a\n\nparticipant in a separate conspiracy, each conspiracy would fit\n\nwithin the description in the indictment: that from March 1996 to\n\nFebruary 1999, North conspired with persons \"known and unknown\"\n\nto \"possess with intent to distribute marijuana.\"\n\n             (3) Substantial Rights.                  In all events, the alleged\n\nvariance through proof of more than one conspiracy did not affect\n\nNorth's substantial rights.                We review this issue de novo, see\n\nWihbey,    75   F.3d    at    774,       and    discern       no    prejudice     from   the\n\npurported variance.\n\n            The    defense         had    notice      of      the    government's        case\n\nsufficient to avoid any surprise at trial.                          There was no danger\n\nof   a    prejudicial        spillover         effect      since     the    evidence      was\n\nsufficient to prove a conspiracy between North and each of the\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\fsuppliers.         There is no reason to suspect any ensuing confusion\n\nabout the scope of the judgment, which runs solely against North.\n\n              As     to   Count      Four,   since       each   of   North's      allegedly\n\nseparate agreements within the confines of the Count Three charge,\n\nthere also was no lack of proof that North \"used and carried\" each\n\nof the weapons identified in Count Four \"during and in relation\n\nto the drug trafficking crime alleged in Count Three.\"\n\n              B.      Vagueness of the Indictment\n\n              North argues for the first time on appeal that the Count\n\nThree conspiracy charge is impermissibly vague.                       He suggests that\n\nan    overall      lack    of     specificity,       as     well     as    some   specific\n\nomissions,2 may have prejudiced him by giving insufficient notice\n\n\"of    what     he    must      be   prepared       to    meet,\"     and    allowing   the\n\nprosecution to \"guess\" at the facts upon which the grand jury had\n\nrelied.       As a result, he urges, he was deprived of his right to\n\nbe tried only on charges presented to the grand jury.\n\n               North does not point to any actual prejudice, but draws\n\nupon       general    principles       culled       from    a   number      of    factually\n\ndistinguishable cases, including Russell v. United States, 369\n\nU.S. 749, 763-70 (1962).              However, the facts of each case and the\n\n\n\n       2\n      North essentially backs into this point, arguing that the\ncharge is impermissibly vague unless it is construed to charge a\nconspiracy solely between North and Monaghan.      Construing the\nindictment as written, to include a conspiracy with unnamed others\nand without specification of an overt act, he argues, renders it\ntoo uncertain.\n\n                                             -10-\n\fparticular crime charged necessarily inform any evaluation of the\n\nfairness of notice of the conduct charged by the grand jury.\n\nTomasetta, 429 F.2d 978, 979 (1st Cir. 1970).        The test is \"not\n\nwhether in hindsight the indictment or information could have been\n\nmore complete. . . but rather whether it fairly identifies and\n\ndescribes the offense.\"     United States v. Allard, 864 F.2d 248,\n\n250 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n          A perfect alignment between the indictment's charge and\n\nthe offense conduct of conviction is not required.          Where the\n\ndefendant is convicted of narrower conduct than that charged in\n\nthe indictment, there is no violation of the Fifth Amendment as\n\nlong as the trial proof corresponds to an offense which was\n\nclearly set out in the indictment.      United States v. Miller, 471\n\nU.S. 130, 136 (1985).\n\n          Here,    the   indictment    clearly   charged   that   North\n\nconspired with Monaghan and \"known and unknown\" other persons to\n\npossess and distribute large quantities of marijuana in and around\n\nidentified cities and towns in Massachusetts during a specified\n\ntwo-year period.   The trial proof conformed to the indictment by\n\nshowing that North in fact conspired with a number of persons to\n\nbuy and sell large quantities of marijuana on many occasions in\n\nthe relevant time period, in and around the named places.           The\n\noffense proved, as in Miller, was thus fully contained in the\n\nindictment, and no additional crime was added.         Id. at 137-38,\n\n\n                                -11-\n\f143.     And North has not shown that the indictment's wording (as\n\nsupplemented        in    the     bill       of       particulars       and    in       pretrial\n\ndiscovery), in any way prejudiced his ability either to defend\n\nhimself at trial or to use the judgment as a bar to subsequent\n\nprosecutions.        Id. at 138 n.5.\n\n                At any rate, any possible vagueness argument was waived\n\nby the failure to object on that ground at trial.                                   See United\n\nStates     v.    Cotton,    535       U.S.      625,     631     (2002)      (holding        that,\n\ngenerally, defects in an indictment may be waived).                            Accordingly,\n\nwe apply a plain error standard of review.                        Id.\n\n                That ends the matter.                 Even if there were an error --\n\nand we see none -- there is no reason to believe that it had any\n\neffect on North's substantial rights since he had ample actual\n\nnotice of the government's case against him.                              There is also no\n\nreason to doubt the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of\n\nthe proceedings.           Here, as in Cotton, \"the real threat to the\n\nfairness,        integrity,      and       public       reputation      of    the       judicial\n\nproceedings       would    be    if    .    .     .    despite    the     overwhelming         and\n\nuncontroverted evidence that [defendant] was involved in a vast\n\ndrug conspiracy,\"          his    conviction           was     reversed      due   to    a    non-\n\nprejudicial miswording of the indictment.                        Id. at 634.\n\n                Names of Co-conspirators.                 North also argues for the\n\nfirst time on appeal that the indictment is insufficient because\n\nit   did   not     identify      by    name       any    co-conspirators           other      than\n\n\n                                             -12-\n\fMonaghan.    But there is no requirement that an indictment specify\n\nthe names of co-conspirators.                The only relevant question is\n\nwhether, without the names, the defendant had sufficient notice\n\nof the charged offense to prepare a defense and to know whether\n\nthere was    reason      to   plead   a    former       acquittal      or    conviction.\n\nUnited States v. Indorato, 628 F.2d 711, 717 (1st Cir. 1980).\n\n            North was given sufficient pretrial notice of the names\n\nand testimony of alleged co-conspirators to enable him to prepare\n\na defense.    There was and is no legitimate double jeopardy issue.\n\nConsequently, there was no prejudice -- and no plain error.\n\n     Overt act.         North argues for the first time on appeal that\n\nthe conspiracy count is insufficient because it fails to                        specify\n\nan overt act.      Under 21 U.S.C. Â§ 846, the federal crime of drug\n\nconspiracy is complete upon the making of an agreement.                               See\n\nUnited    States   v.    Shabani,     513    U.S.       10,    15-16    (1994).       The\n\nconspiratorial     agreement     itself      is       the   \"actus     reus,\"    so   the\n\ngovernment is \"not required to plead or prove any overt act in\n\nfurtherance of a section 846 conspiracy.\"                     United States v. Vega-\n\nFigueroa, 234 F.3d 744, 753 (1st Cir. 2000) (quoting United States\n\nv. Bello-Perez 977 F.2d 664, 669 (1st Cir. 1992)); cf. United\n\nStates v.    Nelson-Rodriguez,        319        F.3d    12,     28   (1st   Cir.   2003)\n\n(noting    that    an    agreement    may        be     proved    by    circumstantial\n\nevidence).    Thus, no plain error attended this omission.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -13-\n\f           C.     Monaghan's Acquittal\n\n           Although       North   disclaims   any      argument   for   acquittal\n\nbased on inconsistent verdicts, he argues that since Monaghan was\n\nacquitted of the conspiracy charge, he too must be acquitted.                  He\n\noffers several theories to bridge this gap.\n\n           First, North argues that Monaghan's acquittal requires\n\nthat all references to her must be read out of the indictment,\n\nthus allegedly rendering the indictment insufficient for lack of\n\nspecificity.      As the government sensibly rejoins, the sufficiency\n\nof an indictment is not determined by hindsight but by whether it\n\ngave fair notice at the outset, stated all the elements of the\n\noffense, and enabled a plea of double jeopardy.                    As discussed\n\nabove, the indictment passed this test.\n\n                Second,     North    argues     that     Monaghan's      acquittal\n\nlogically means that there was insufficient proof against him of\n\nthe one conspiracy concretely noticed in the indictment, i.e., a\n\nNorth/Monaghan conspiracy.          This tautology, too, must be rejected.\n\nIn United States v. Bucuvalas, 909 F.2d 593 (1st Cir. 1990), we\n\nrejected a nearly identical argument, holding that the acquittal\n\nof the only other named co-conspirator did not mean that there\n\nexisted no conspiracy between the two but might instead mean,\n\namong other possibilities, that the jury was disposed to lenity\n\ntoward the other co-conspirator.          Id. at 595.       Lenity seems to be\n\nan   especially    plausible      explanation    for    Monaghan's      acquittal,\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fsince the government's proof against Monaghan suggested that, by\n\ncomparison to North, she played a very limited role.\n\n              The   bottom    line    is   that,       despite    North's      creative\n\ninterpretation       of    the    indictment,          it    expressly       charged    a\n\nconspiracy that implicated other persons.                     Thus, even if we were\n\nto apply a rule requiring consistency, (i.e., requiring reversal\n\nof   a   conspirator's       conviction         when    all     other    alleged       co-\n\nconspirators        have   been      acquitted),        there    is     no     perceived\n\ninconsistency \"where the convicted defendant was alleged and shown\n\nto have conspired with one or more persons who were unapprehended,\n\ndead,    or    simply      unknown,    .    .    .     [or     where]    any     [other]\n\ncoconspirator's case was disposed of other than on the merits.\"\n\nId. at 595 n.3.       North's conviction obviously fits into the latter\n\ncategory, so there was no inconsistency here.\n\n               In a third variation on this theme, North argues that\n\nthe court's charge to the jury that each defendant's participation\n\nin the conspiracy should be separately determined amounted to a\n\nconstructive amendment.           In light of what we already have said,\n\nthe instruction was correct.               Upon de novo review of the jury\n\ninstruction, we find that it was faithful to the indictment's\n\ncharge and there was no constructive amendment.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\f            II.       Alleged Evidentiary Errors\n\n            North also assigns as error the unobjected-to admission\n\ninto evidence of several pieces of evidence.                      We assess each claim\n\nof error separately.\n\n            A.        The Murder of Aislin Silva.\n\n            Upon our own review, there was neither plain error nor\n\nprejudice      to     North   in     the     admission         into   evidence   of     the\n\nscattered, oblique references to Silva's murder in lengthy tape\n\nrecordings and in a few exhibits.                        Indeed, the defense took\n\nadvantage of the fact of the murder as a means of disparaging the\n\ncredibility of at least one unfriendly witness, Regan, and any\n\npossibility      of      prejudice      to    North      was    dispelled   by   Regan's\n\ntestimony on cross-examination that North was not involved in the\n\nmurder.\n\n            B. Alleged Perjury.\n\n            North asserts that the prosecution presented perjured\n\ntestimony   in      violation      of    his    right     to    due   process    when    it\n\npermitted Starita to testify that he first met North in 1996.\n\nImpliedly, North urges that the                admission of the alleged perjury\n\nwas   \"plain      error.\"         He    asserts       that      Starita's   perjury      is\n\ndemonstrated        by   record    evidence         of   an     inconsistency    between\n\nStarita's grand jury and trial testimony and by inconsistencies\n\nbetween Starita's trial testimony and facts recorded in a hearsay\n\nstatement that was excluded from evidence.                       Upon our own review,\n\n\n                                             -16-\n\fwe apprehend no proof in the record of any perjury, merely some\n\nattenuated or arguable inconsistencies among witnesses, and no\n\nerror at all in the admission of Starita's testimony about the\n\ndate.\n\n             C.    Allegedly Coerced Confession.\n\n             North impliedly urges            plain error in the failure of the\n\ncourt to exclude his confession from evidence and/or to order a\n\nhearing     into    its    voluntariness.             North   admitted    on   direct\n\nexamination        that    he    had   made     an    inculpatory     statement    to\n\ngovernment investigators during a pretrial proffer session, but\n\nhe said that the statement was a lie.                   On cross-examination, he\n\nasserted that the statement had been elicited from him by the\n\ninvestigators through threats and                    the \"torture\" of his family\n\nmembers.\n\n             Upon our own review of the record, we see no meaningful\n\nindicia of coercion.            North's conclusory accusations instead seem\n\nto   be   refuted     by    the    circumstances        surrounding      the   proffer\n\nsession.3     Accordingly, there was no plain error in the court's\n\nfailure sua sponte to either notice this as an issue or to order\n\na hearing on the voluntariness of the statement.                      See generally\n\n\n\n\n      3\n      A government investigator testified that the proffer session\nwas arranged to accommodate North's spontaneous request for the\nsession. North was apparently represented by counsel at the time\n(or, at least, was given the opportunity to have counsel present.\n\n                                         -17-\n\fUnited States v. Santiago Soto, 871 F.2d 200, 201-03             (1st Cir.\n\n1989).\n\n            III.    INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE CLAIMS\n\n            North has raised a number of claims of ineffective\n\nassistance by trial counsel.         We decline to address them on direct\n\nappeal.\n\n            \"Although    we   have   occasionally    reviewed   ineffective\n\nassistance claims on direct appeal, 'we travel this route only\n\nwhen the critical facts are not in dispute and the record is\n\nsufficiently developed to allow reasoned consideration of the\n\nclaim.\"   United States v. Benjamin, 252 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir. 2001)\n\n(quoting United States v. Mala, 7 F.3d 1058, 1063 (1st Cir.\n\n1993)).   As we observed in Mala, \"[w]e have held with a regularity\n\nbordering    on    the   monotonous      that   fact-specific   claims    of\n\nineffective assistance cannot make their debut on direct review\n\nof criminal convictions, but, rather, must originally be presented\n\nto, and acted upon by, the trial court.\"             Mala, 7 F.3d at 1063.\n\nNorth's fact-sensitive claims of ineffective assistance were not\n\npresented    to    the   trial   court   for    initial   consideration   as\n\ncontemplated by 28 U.S.C. Â§ 2255, and the record is insufficiently\n\ndeveloped    to    permit     reasoned   appellate    consideration   under\n\nordinary standards of appellate review.          That ends the matter.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\f             IV.   DENIAL OF REQUEST TO PROCEED PRO SE\n\n             We see no error in the denial of North's mid-trial\n\nrequest to proceed pro se.          On the eleventh day of the trial,\n\nNorth     requested   that   his   trial   counsel's   representation   be\n\npermitted to continue only until the close of the prosecution's\n\ncase so that, thereafter, North could present his case in defense\n\npro se.    He explained that he wished to call and recall witnesses\n\nin order to pose questions and present theories with which his\n\ncounsel disagreed.\n\n             The court held a hearing on the request and engaged\n\nNorth in a lengthy colloquy anent the evidence and theories that\n\nhe wished to present.        The court also heard from North's counsel,\n\ncounsel for co-defendant Monaghan, and the government.          The court\n\nthen rejected North's request.\n\n             The controlling legal principles are clear:\n\n                   A district court has considerable\n                   discretion to grant or deny a\n                   request    for   self-representation\n                   that is not presented until trial\n                   is   underway.    .   .    But  that\n                   discretion is not unbridled. It is\n                   improper for the court to deny the\n                   defendant the right to serve as his\n                   own attorney solely because of a\n                   perceived lack of legal dexterity.\n                   . . Rather, in the last analysis\n                   the   court     must   balance   the\n                   legitimate     interests    of   the\n                   defendant in self-representation\n                   against the potential disruption of\n                   the     proceedings     already   in\n                   progress.\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\fUnited   States   v.    Noah,      130    F.3d     490,     498   (1st   Cir.     1997)\n\n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted); cf. Faretta v.\n\nCalifornia,   422      U.S.    806,      834-36     (1975)    (observing        that   a\n\ndefendant has an absolute right to self-representation when the\n\nright is asserted in a timely manner prior to trial).\n\n           The trial judge's decision rejecting North's request\n\nexpressly balanced a myriad of relevant factors including the\n\ncomplexity of the trial, the numerous delays and conferences that\n\nhad already occurred, the likely further disruption that might be\n\ncaused by granting the request, and the likely prejudice to the\n\nother parties.    The court supportably found that the evidence that\n\nNorth wished to present on his own was remote, collateral and\n\nprobably   prejudicial        to   his    own     cause,4    whereas     his    defense\n\nlawyers \"are highly experienced and skilled, [and] have obviously\n\ndevoted a great deal of time and effort\" to the case.                          In these\n\ncircumstances, the court concluded that permitting North to change\n\ncourse in order to represent himself mid-trial would cause an\n\nintolerable disruption of the orderly process of the trial -- a\n\ndisruption that outweighed any legitimate interest he might have\n\nin self-representation.            For the same reason, the court also\n\nproperly refused a narrower request to permit North to make his\n\nown closing argument.\n\n\n     4\n      Because this determination was unexceptionable, we also\nreject North's argument that he was deprived of his constitutional\nright to call witnesses in his own defense.\n\n                                         -20-\n\f           These     rulings    pass   muster.        As    we    said     in   similar\n\ncircumstances:\n\n                   The    reasonableness    of    this\n                   conclusion is scarcely open to\n                   question. District Courts have an\n                   institutional interest in avoiding\n                   the     disruption     of    trial\n                   proceedings. To permit a defendant\n                   to switch roles near the halfway\n                   point of a complicated criminal\n                   trial runs an obvious risk of\n                   dislocating both the court's docket\n                   and the orderly progression on the\n                   trial. . . [and] . . . would have\n                   tended     to    prejudice      the\n                   prosecution.\n\nNoah, 130 F.3d at 498.\n\n           V.      SENTENCING\n\n           North argues that the court erred in several ways in\n\ncomputing his sentence for Counts One through Three (but he does\n\nnot challenge his mandatory 30-year consecutive sentence on Count\n\nFour for use of a firearm during a drug trafficking crime).                       North\n\nwas sentenced to a total of 180 months on these three counts, as\n\nfollows:\n\n           (1)   Concurrent      terms    of    120      months     (the    statutory\n\nmaximum on each count) for the \"groupable\" weapons possession\n\noffenses in Counts One and Two.\n\n           (2)   A   consecutive       term    of   60     months    for    the    drug\n\nconspiracy count (Count Three).5\n\n\n     5\n      Although Count Three might have carried a higher sentence\nsince more than 1000 kilograms had been noticed in the indictment\n\n                                       -21-\n\f             North asserts that two types of errors occurred.           First,\n\nhe accuses the court of computational mistakes under USSG                     Â§\n\n5G1.2.       These are figments of his imagination.            The district\n\ncourt simply did not mis-compute the \"total punishment\" for the\n\nthree counts in the ways that North claims.                Rather, the court\n\ncorrectly computed North's adjusted combined offense level (34),\n\nand   from    that,   in   conjunction   with    North's   criminal    history\n\ncategory,     correctly    determined    the   guideline   sentencing    range\n\n(188-235).\n\n             Nor did the court err in its refusal to run all three\n\nsentences     concurrently.      Instead,      having   determined    that   the\n\nsentencing range was 188-235 months, and that none of the counts\n\nof conviction had a statutory maximum greater or equal to the\n\ntotal punishment, the court correctly followed the guidelines.\n\n\"The Guidelines mandate the imposition of consecutive sentences\n\nin order to achieve (as close as possible) the 'total punishment.'\n\n\"     United States v. Garcia-Torres, 341 F.3d 61, 75 (1st Cir.\n\n2003); see also USSG Â§ 5G1.2(d).\n\n             North's other argument is that the court violated the\n\nrule in Apprendi by imposing a sentence in excess of 60 months.\n\n\nand more than 1600 kilograms had been proven at trial, see 21\nU.S.C. Â§ 841(b)(1)(A)), the drug quantity issue had not been\nsubmitted to the jury. At sentencing, the government agreed that\nin light of the intervening decision in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530\nU.S. 466, 490 (2000), North should receive only the default\nstatutory maximum (60 months) on this count. This concession seems\nextremely generous, but the Apprendi issue is not before us.\n\n                                    -22-\n\fThe argument is hard to follow but seems to include an attack on\n\nthe court's reliance upon the 1600+ kilos shown in evidence at\n\ntrial to compute his base offense level.

Collery,\nAttorney, Appellate Section, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                            January 22, 2004\n\f             Per Curiam.         Jeffrey North appeals his conviction and\n\nforty-five        year   sentence      for    drug     trafficking     and     weapons\n\nviolations.       We affirm.\n\n          The        indictment        charged       North   with    one   count    of\n\nconspiracy to possess with intent to distribute large quantities\n\nof marijuana, two counts of illegal possession of weapons, and one\n\ncount of illegal \"use and carry\" of weapons in relation to the\n\ncharged drug conspiracy.            North's co-defendant, Regina Monaghan,\n\nwas jointly charged in the drug conspiracy and, in a separate\n\ncount, also charged with money laundering.\n\n             At    the   close    of    a    seventeen-day     joint    jury     trial,\n\nMonaghan was acquitted.            North was convicted of all the charges\n\nagainst him.       He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of forty-\n\nfive years.\n\n              The evidence against North included the testimony of\n\n three   witnesses        who    each       headed    his    own    (separate)     drug\n\n distribution ring:         Starita, Stevens and Petraglia.                  Petraglia\n\n initially had assisted Stevens, becoming a separate supplier to\n\n North when Stevens left town.                Each supplier-witness testified\n\n in detail that on multiple occasions he supplied to North very\n\n large (wholesale) quantities of marijuana in exchange for North's\n\n payment of large amounts of cash.                 During each transaction, North\n\n re-wrapped the drugs that he purchased in a unique fashion in the\n\n supplier's presence.            Each supplier also testified that North\n\n\n                                             -2-\n\fcarried, displayed and/or brandished various firearms during the\n\ntransactions.    The suppliers' testimony was corroborated by other\n\nwitnesses who had played lesser roles in the deals, including\n\nAdams   (who   assisted      in   transactions   with     both   Stevens   and\n\nPetraglia),    Rosa   (who    helped    Stevens),   and    Butler   (who   was\n\nNorth's driver and who witnessed, inter alia, North's purchase\n\nof weapons and his resale of drugs).\n\n           North's connection to the weapons identified by the\n\nsuppliers also was corroborated by the testimony of one Regan.\n\nRegan testified that he and other members of the \"DeCologero\n\ngang\" had stolen firearms from North's apartment, including the\n\nmachine gun, silencer, UZI and ammunition charged to North in the\n\nindictment.     The robbers had stashed some of the stolen weapons\n\nin the apartment of a young woman, Aislin Silva.                 A search of\n\nAislin Silva's apartment by the ATF in November 1996, revealed\n\nthe guns, which were duly seized.            Others of North's weapons\n\napparently ended up in a marsh where they were found in February\n\n1997.\n\n           North testified in his own defense, denying almost\n\nevery one of the government witnesses' incriminating allegations.\n\nIn turn, North accused his accusers of engaging in a perjurious\n\neffort to frame him for their own drug dealing and falsely to\n\nattribute to him control or possession of weapons that the\n\naccusers had used in connection with their own drug activities.\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fOther incriminating physical evidence found by the police among\n\nNorth's       possessions,       North     said,    actually    belonged      to   the\n\ngovernment       witnesses.         Still,       North   admitted     that    he   was\n\nacquainted with all of the drug-dealer witnesses (testifying that\n\nhe    worked    as    a    pet/house-sitter        for   Stevens);    that    he   had\n\nillegally purchased other drugs (steroids for personal use); and\n\nthat he had participated in at least one theft of money from one\n\nof the drug suppliers.\n\n                North's testimonial protestations of innocence were\n\nseverely impeached on cross-examination by proof of his own\n\ninconsistent         out-of-court         admissions     in    (1)    tape-recorded\n\ntelephone calls that he made from state prison to government\n\nwitnesses, and (2) a statement that he made in a proffer session\n\nafter his arrest.            In an effort to blunt the impeaching effect,\n\nNorth asserted at trial that his taped telephonic comments did\n\nnot    mean    what       they   seemed    to    mean,   and   that   the    pretrial\n\nstatement he had proffered to the government was filled with\n\nlies.\n\n               North was represented by counsel at trial.                    In mid-\n\ntrial, he moved for permission to proceed pro se.                      That motion\n\nwas denied.          After the trial, he was permitted to represent\n\nhimself at sentencing, although the court also appointed standby\n\ncounsel for him.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\f            On appeal, North initially chose to proceed pro se.              He\n\nthen changed his mind and moved for appointment of counsel.                That\n\nmotion was granted.            He then reversed field once again, and\n\ninsisted upon appearing pro se.            He persisted in that position\n\nnotwithstanding this court's stern warning about the difficulties\n\nhe likely would face if he chose to proceed without counsel on\n\nappeal.     We ultimately granted his renewed motion to appear pro\n\nse.\n\n            North's brief presents ten labeled points.            Each point\n\nincludes a number of sub-points.           Almost all of the issues are\n\nvaguely or imprecisely framed.        In light of his pro se status, we\n\ninterpret    his   arguments     liberally,    gleaning,   by   subject,    the\n\nfollowing sets of issues.\n\n            I.     THE CONSPIRACY CHARGE\n\n            North argues that there were a number of variances\n\nbetween the evidence adduced at trial and the conspiracy charged\n\nin Count Three of the superseding indictment.              As a result, he\n\nurges   that     there   was    insufficient    evidence   to   support     his\n\nconviction on Counts Three and Four.           Count Three charges:\n\n            From in or about March, 1996 to in or about\n            February,   1999,   at  Stoneham,   Tewksbury,\n            Melrose and elsewhere in the District of\n            Massachusetts, and elsewhere . . . . Jeffrey\n            North and Regina Monaghan. . . . defendants\n            herein,   did   knowingly  and   intentionally\n            combine, conspire, confederate and agree with\n            each other, and with other persons known and\n            unknown to the Grand Jury, to possess with\n            intent to distribute marijuana. . . . in\n\n                                     -5-\n\f           violation of Title 21, United States Code,\n           Section 841(a)(1) . . . . [and] Section 846.\n\n           Count Four is dependent on Count Three.                 Count Four\n\ncharges that North \"used\" and \"carried\"             specifically identified\n\nweapons \"during and in relation to the drug trafficking crime\n\nalleged in Count Three . . .\"\n\n           A.     \"Single\" vs. \"Multiple\" Conspiracies\n\n           Below, all parties agreed that Count Three charged a\n\n\"single\" conspiracy.      The defense objected that the government's\n\nevidence varied from the charge by instead indicating at least two\n\nseparate   conspiracies   between     North   and    his   competing   supply\n\nsources:   one conspiracy between North and the distribution ring\n\nof Stevens/Adams/Rosa (and possibly Petraglia), and the other\n\nconspiracy exclusively between North and Starita.1             There was no\n\ninterdependence among the competing sources, nor proof even of an\n\nawareness of the other suppliers by Starita, according to the\n\ndefense.     In   opposition,   the    government      contended    that   the\n\n\n\n     1\n      The defense also argued, and North echos here, that the one\nand     only    conspiracy      properly    noticed     was     the\nStevens/Adams/Rosa/Petraglia conspiracy since Starita's testimony\nhad been insufficiently noticed.         As framed, the argument\nimplicates both Count Three and Count Four (as the proof that North\nhad \"used and carried\" some of the weapons identified in Count Four\nhad come largely from Starita's testimony about guns brandished\nduring the Starita/North transactions). This argument is belied by\nthe record. While Starita's name initially was omitted from a bill\nof particulars that named the other conspirators, notice of\nStarita's testimony was given approximately two and one-half weeks\nbefore the start of trial. The timing and manner of the notice was\nnot shown to have caused any separate prejudice to the defense.\n\n                                    -6-\n\fevidence proved that North was the \"hub\" of a single conspiracy\n\nto acquire marijuana from multiple sources of supply.                 These\n\nsources necessarily substituted for or supplemented one another\n\nfrom North's point of view.\n\n         The court correctly submitted this issue to the jury. The\n\ncourt charged -- as to each defendant -- that the jury should\n\ndetermine whether the evidence showed one \"overall\" conspiracy or\n\nseparate conspiracies, and \"if you believe the evidence shows that\n\neither defendant was a member of a conspiracy different from the\n\none charged in the indictment, then you must find him or her not\n\nguilty. . . \"\n\n             As raised on appeal, North's attack poses three sub-\n\nquestions:\n\n            (1) Is the evidence sufficient to permit a\n            jury to find the (express or tacit) agreement\n            that the indictment charges? (2) If not, is\n            it sufficient to permit a jury, under a\n            proper set of instructions, to convict the\n            defendant of a related, similar conspiracy?\n            (3) If so, does the variance affect the\n            defendants substantial rights or does the\n            difference between the charged conspiracy and\n            the conspiracy proved amount to \"harmless\n            error?\"\n\nUnited States v.

All\n\nparticipants thus had as a \"common goal\" an interest in selling\n\nmarijuana for a profit.         See Portela, 167 F.3d at 694 (reasoning\n\n\"that     each    defendant     had    an    interest      in     furthering   the\n\ndistribution of [drugs] is also sufficient evidence that they\n\nshared a common goal with the other participants\").                     Proof of\n\nNorth's     own    \"pervasive     involvement\"       as     the    \"single     core\n\nconspirator\"      also   sufficed     to     show   an    \"overlap\"    among    the\n\nparticipants.

In all events, the alleged\n\nvariance through proof of more than one conspiracy did not affect\n\nNorth's substantial rights.                We review this issue de novo, see\n\nWihbey,    75   F.3d    at    774,       and    discern       no    prejudice     from   the\n\npurported variance.\n\n            The    defense         had    notice      of      the    government's        case\n\nsufficient to avoid any surprise at trial.                          There was no danger\n\nof   a    prejudicial        spillover         effect      since     the    evidence      was\n\nsufficient to prove a conspiracy between North and each of the\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\fsuppliers.         There is no reason to suspect any ensuing confusion\n\nabout the scope of the judgment, which runs solely against North.\n\n              As     to   Count      Four,   since       each   of   North's      allegedly\n\nseparate agreements within the confines of the Count Three charge,\n\nthere also was no lack of proof that North \"used and carried\" each\n\nof the weapons identified in Count Four \"during and in relation\n\nto the drug trafficking crime alleged in Count Three.\"\n\n              B.      Vagueness of the Indictment\n\n              North argues for the first time on appeal that the Count\n\nThree conspiracy charge is impermissibly vague.                       He suggests that\n\nan    overall      lack    of     specificity,       as     well     as    some   specific\n\nomissions,2 may have prejudiced him by giving insufficient notice\n\n\"of    what     he    must      be   prepared       to    meet,\"     and    allowing   the\n\nprosecution to \"guess\" at the facts upon which the grand jury had\n\nrelied.       As a result, he urges, he was deprived of his right to\n\nbe tried only on charges presented to the grand jury.\n\n               North does not point to any actual prejudice, but draws\n\nupon       general    principles       culled       from    a   number      of    factually\n\ndistinguishable cases, including Russell v.

The trial proof conformed to the indictment by\n\nshowing that North in fact conspired with a number of persons to\n\nbuy and sell large quantities of marijuana on many occasions in\n\nthe relevant time period, in and around the named places.           The\n\noffense proved, as in Miller, was thus fully contained in the\n\nindictment, and no additional crime was added.         Id. at 137-38,\n\n\n                                -11-\n\f143.     And North has not shown that the indictment's wording (as\n\nsupplemented        in    the     bill       of       particulars       and    in       pretrial\n\ndiscovery), in any way prejudiced his ability either to defend\n\nhimself at trial or to use the judgment as a bar to subsequent\n\nprosecutions.        Id. at 138 n.5.\n\n                At any rate, any possible vagueness argument was waived\n\nby the failure to object on that ground at trial.

Accordingly,\n\nwe apply a plain error standard of review.                        Id.\n\n                That ends the matter.                 Even if there were an error --\n\nand we see none -- there is no reason to believe that it had any\n\neffect on North's substantial rights since he had ample actual\n\nnotice of the government's case against him.                              There is also no\n\nreason to doubt the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of\n\nthe proceedings.           Here, as in Cotton, \"the real threat to the\n\nfairness,        integrity,      and       public       reputation      of    the       judicial\n\nproceedings       would    be    if    .    .     .    despite    the     overwhelming         and\n\nuncontroverted evidence that [defendant] was involved in a vast\n\ndrug conspiracy,\"          his    conviction           was     reversed      due   to    a    non-\n\nprejudicial miswording of the indictment.

But there is no requirement that an indictment specify\n\nthe names of co-conspirators.                The only relevant question is\n\nwhether, without the names, the defendant had sufficient notice\n\nof the charged offense to prepare a defense and to know whether\n\nthere was    reason      to   plead   a    former       acquittal      or    conviction.\n\nUnited States v.

There was and is no legitimate double jeopardy issue.\n\nConsequently, there was no prejudice -- and no plain error.\n\n     Overt act.         North argues for the first time on appeal that\n\nthe conspiracy count is insufficient because it fails to                        specify\n\nan overt act.      Under 21 U.S.C.

Monaghan's Acquittal\n\n           Although       North   disclaims   any      argument   for   acquittal\n\nbased on inconsistent verdicts, he argues that since Monaghan was\n\nacquitted of the conspiracy charge, he too must be acquitted.                  He\n\noffers several theories to bridge this gap.\n\n           First, North argues that Monaghan's acquittal requires\n\nthat all references to her must be read out of the indictment,\n\nthus allegedly rendering the indictment insufficient for lack of\n\nspecificity.      As the government sensibly rejoins, the sufficiency\n\nof an indictment is not determined by hindsight but by whether it\n\ngave fair notice at the outset, stated all the elements of the\n\noffense, and enabled a plea of double jeopardy.                    As discussed\n\nabove, the indictment passed this test.\n\n                Second,     North    argues     that     Monaghan's      acquittal\n\nlogically means that there was insufficient proof against him of\n\nthe one conspiracy concretely noticed in the indictment, i.e., a\n\nNorth/Monaghan conspiracy.          This tautology, too, must be rejected.\n\nIn United States v. Bucuvalas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"545480\"><a href=\"/opinion/545480/united-states-v-george-bucuvalas/\"><span class=\"volume\">909</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">593</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1990), we\n\nrejected a nearly identical argument, holding that the acquittal\n\nof the only other named co-conspirator did not mean that there\n\nexisted no conspiracy between the two but might instead mean,\n\namong other possibilities, that the jury was disposed to lenity\n\ntoward the other co-conspirator.          Id. at 595.       Lenity seems to be\n\nan   especially    plausible      explanation    for    Monaghan's      acquittal,\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fsince the government's proof against Monaghan suggested that, by\n\ncomparison to North, she played a very limited role.\n\n              The   bottom    line    is   that,       despite    North's      creative\n\ninterpretation       of    the    indictment,          it    expressly       charged    a\n\nconspiracy that implicated other persons.                     Thus, even if we were\n\nto apply a rule requiring consistency, (i.e., requiring reversal\n\nof   a   conspirator's       conviction         when    all     other    alleged       co-\n\nconspirators        have   been      acquitted),        there    is     no     perceived\n\ninconsistency \"where the convicted defendant was alleged and shown\n\nto have conspired with one or more persons who were unapprehended,\n\ndead,    or    simply      unknown,    .    .    .     [or     where]    any     [other]\n\ncoconspirator's case was disposed of other than on the merits.\"\n\nId. at 595 n.3.       North's conviction obviously fits into the latter\n\ncategory, so there was no inconsistency here.\n\n               In a third variation on this theme, North argues that\n\nthe court's charge to the jury that each defendant's participation\n\nin the conspiracy should be separately determined amounted to a\n\nconstructive amendment.           In light of what we already have said,\n\nthe instruction was correct.               Upon de novo review of the jury\n\ninstruction, we find that it was faithful to the indictment's\n\ncharge and there was no constructive amendment.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\f            II.       Alleged Evidentiary Errors\n\n            North also assigns as error the unobjected-to admission\n\ninto evidence of several pieces of evidence.                      We assess each claim\n\nof error separately.\n\n            A.        The Murder of Aislin Silva.\n\n            Upon our own review, there was neither plain error nor\n\nprejudice      to     North   in     the     admission         into   evidence   of     the\n\nscattered, oblique references to Silva's murder in lengthy tape\n\nrecordings and in a few exhibits.                        Indeed, the defense took\n\nadvantage of the fact of the murder as a means of disparaging the\n\ncredibility of at least one unfriendly witness, Regan, and any\n\npossibility      of      prejudice      to    North      was    dispelled   by   Regan's\n\ntestimony on cross-examination that North was not involved in the\n\nmurder.\n\n            B. Alleged Perjury.\n\n            North asserts that the prosecution presented perjured\n\ntestimony   in      violation      of    his    right     to    due   process    when    it\n\npermitted Starita to testify that he first met North in 1996.\n\nImpliedly, North urges that the                admission of the alleged perjury\n\nwas   \"plain      error.\"         He    asserts       that      Starita's   perjury      is\n\ndemonstrated        by   record    evidence         of   an     inconsistency    between\n\nStarita's grand jury and trial testimony and by inconsistencies\n\nbetween Starita's trial testimony and facts recorded in a hearsay\n\nstatement that was excluded from evidence.                       Upon our own review,\n\n\n                                             -16-\n\fwe apprehend no proof in the record of any perjury, merely some\n\nattenuated or arguable inconsistencies among witnesses, and no\n\nerror at all in the admission of Starita's testimony about the\n\ndate.\n\n             C.    Allegedly Coerced Confession.\n\n             North impliedly urges            plain error in the failure of the\n\ncourt to exclude his confession from evidence and/or to order a\n\nhearing     into    its    voluntariness.             North   admitted    on   direct\n\nexamination        that    he    had   made     an    inculpatory     statement    to\n\ngovernment investigators during a pretrial proffer session, but\n\nhe said that the statement was a lie.                   On cross-examination, he\n\nasserted that the statement had been elicited from him by the\n\ninvestigators through threats and                    the \"torture\" of his family\n\nmembers.\n\n             Upon our own review of the record, we see no meaningful\n\nindicia of coercion.            North's conclusory accusations instead seem\n\nto   be   refuted     by    the    circumstances        surrounding      the   proffer\n\nsession.3     Accordingly, there was no plain error in the court's\n\nfailure sua sponte to either notice this as an issue or to order\n\na hearing on the voluntariness of the statement.                      See generally\n\n\n\n\n      3\n      A government investigator testified that the proffer session\nwas arranged to accommodate North's spontaneous request for the\nsession. North was apparently represented by counsel at the time\n(or, at least, was given the opportunity to have counsel present.\n\n                                         -17-\n\fUnited States v.

DENIAL OF REQUEST TO PROCEED PRO SE\n\n             We see no error in the denial of North's mid-trial\n\nrequest to proceed pro se.          On the eleventh day of the trial,\n\nNorth     requested   that   his   trial   counsel's   representation   be\n\npermitted to continue only until the close of the prosecution's\n\ncase so that, thereafter, North could present his case in defense\n\npro se.    He explained that he wished to call and recall witnesses\n\nin order to pose questions and present theories with which his\n\ncounsel disagreed.\n\n             The court held a hearing on the request and engaged\n\nNorth in a lengthy colloquy anent the evidence and theories that\n\nhe wished to present.        The court also heard from North's counsel,\n\ncounsel for co-defendant Monaghan, and the government.          The court\n\nthen rejected North's request.\n\n             The controlling legal principles are clear:\n\n                   A district court has considerable\n                   discretion to grant or deny a\n                   request    for   self-representation\n                   that is not presented until trial\n                   is   underway.    .   .    But  that\n                   discretion is not unbridled. It is\n                   improper for the court to deny the\n                   defendant the right to serve as his\n                   own attorney solely because of a\n                   perceived lack of legal dexterity.\n                   . .

The court supportably found that the evidence that\n\nNorth wished to present on his own was remote, collateral and\n\nprobably   prejudicial        to   his    own     cause,4    whereas     his    defense\n\nlawyers \"are highly experienced and skilled, [and] have obviously\n\ndevoted a great deal of time and effort\" to the case.                          In these\n\ncircumstances, the court concluded that permitting North to change\n\ncourse in order to represent himself mid-trial would cause an\n\nintolerable disruption of the orderly process of the trial -- a\n\ndisruption that outweighed any legitimate interest he might have\n\nin self-representation.            For the same reason, the court also\n\nproperly refused a narrower request to permit North to make his\n\nown closing argument.\n\n\n     4\n      Because this determination was unexceptionable, we also\nreject North's argument that he was deprived of his constitutional\nright to call witnesses in his own defense.\n\n                                         -20-\n\f           These     rulings    pass   muster.        As    we    said     in   similar\n\ncircumstances:\n\n                   The    reasonableness    of    this\n                   conclusion is scarcely open to\n                   question. District Courts have an\n                   institutional interest in avoiding\n                   the     disruption     of    trial\n                   proceedings. To permit a defendant\n                   to switch roles near the halfway\n                   point of a complicated criminal\n                   trial runs an obvious risk of\n                   dislocating both the court's docket\n                   and the orderly progression on the\n                   trial. . . [and] . . . would have\n                   tended     to    prejudice      the\n                   prosecution.\n\nNoah, 130 F.3d at 498.\n\n           V.      SENTENCING\n\n           North argues that the court erred in several ways in\n\ncomputing his sentence for Counts One through Three (but he does\n\nnot challenge his mandatory 30-year consecutive sentence on Count\n\nFour for use of a firearm during a drug trafficking crime).                       North\n\nwas sentenced to a total of 180 months on these three counts, as\n\nfollows:\n\n           (1)   Concurrent      terms    of    120      months     (the    statutory\n\nmaximum on each count) for the \"groupable\" weapons possession\n\noffenses in Counts One and Two.\n\n           (2)   A   consecutive       term    of   60     months    for    the    drug\n\nconspiracy count (Count Three).5\n\n\n     5\n      Although Count Three might have carried a higher sentence\nsince more than 1000 kilograms had been noticed in the indictment\n\n                                       -21-\n\f             North asserts that two types of errors occurred.           First,\n\nhe accuses the court of computational mistakes under USSG                     Â§\n\n5G1.2.       These are figments of his imagination.            The district\n\ncourt simply did not mis-compute the \"total punishment\" for the\n\nthree counts in the ways that North claims.                Rather, the court\n\ncorrectly computed North's adjusted combined offense level (34),\n\nand   from    that,   in   conjunction   with    North's   criminal    history\n\ncategory,     correctly    determined    the   guideline   sentencing    range\n\n(188-235).\n\n             Nor did the court err in its refusal to run all three\n\nsentences     concurrently.      Instead,      having   determined    that   the\n\nsentencing range was 188-235 months, and that none of the counts\n\nof conviction had a statutory maximum greater or equal to the\n\ntotal punishment, the court correctly followed the guidelines.\n\n\"The Guidelines mandate the imposition of consecutive sentences\n\nin order to achieve (as close as possible) the 'total punishment.'\n\n\"     United States v. Garcia-Torres, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200606\"><a href=\"/opinion/200606/united-states-v-garcia-torres/\"><span class=\"volume\">341</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">61</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 75 (1st Cir.\n\n2003); see also USSG Â§ 5G1.2(d).\n\n             North's other argument is that the court violated the\n\nrule in Apprendi by imposing a sentence in excess of 60 months.\n\n\nand more than 1600 kilograms had been proven at trial, see 21\nU.S.C. Â§ 841(b)(1)(A)), the drug quantity issue had not been\nsubmitted to the jury. At sentencing, the government agreed that\nin light of the intervening decision in Apprendi v. New Jersey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 490 (2000), North should receive only the default\nstatutory maximum (60 months) on this count. This concession seems\nextremely generous, but the Apprendi issue is not before us.\n\n                                    -22-\n\fThe argument is hard to follow but seems to include an attack on\n\nthe court's reliance upon the 1600+ kilos shown in evidence at\n\ntrial to compute his base offense level.              But Apprendi does not\n\npreclude a sentencing court from considering a fact that has not\n\nbeen   submitted    to    the   jury     for   purposes     authorized    by   the\n\nsentencing guidelines -- so long as the sentence imposed does not\n\nexceed the applicable statutory maximum.                See United States v.\n\nCaba, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199298\"><a href=\"/opinion/199298/united-states-v-caba/\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 100 (1st Cir. 2001).              Moreover, Apprendi         is\n\nnot violated by the imposition of consecutive sentences to the\n\nextent necessary to achieve the prescribed total punishment under\n\nÂ§ 5G1.2 -- so long as the defendant does not receive greater than\n\nthe statutorily prescribed maximum sentence on any particular\n\ncount.

We reject them all.\n\n            For   these    reasons,      the   conviction    and    sentence   are\n\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -23-\n\f</pre>",
