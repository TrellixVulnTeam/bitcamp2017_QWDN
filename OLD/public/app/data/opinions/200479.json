George Z. Singal, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                      Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n              Torruella and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Lawrence C.

Appellant Catherine Liston is a\n\nformer officer of UnumProvident Corporation (\"UP\"), an insurance\n\ncompany incorporated in Delaware.            Prior to its June 1999 merger\n\nwith Provident Companies, Inc., the UNUM Corporation had adopted an\n\nofficer   severance    plan    (\"the   plan\")    to   provide   benefits   for\n\nofficers whose jobs were \"eliminated\" as a result of a \"change in\n\ncontrol\" of the company.       The benefits could amount to as much as\n\n36 weeks' salary, and an officer could obtain them if any of the\n\nplan's    triggering   conditions      were    satisfied,   importantly:    a\n\n\"significant adverse reduction or alteration in the nature and\n\nstatus (other than title) of the officer's position, duties or\n\nresponsibilities   . . .      within 365 days of the change in control.\"\n\n            After the merger, Liston, who was one of several vice-\n\npresidents at UP,1 found that her obligations had increased and\n\nthat her authority had diminished.            She claimed that she had to\n\nwork an additional 20 hours per week and travel three times more\n\noften.    In addition, she said that she had less authority to make\n\nstrategic and administrative decisions (e.g., salary decisions for\n\nsubordinates).     Liston viewed these changes as a \"significant\n\nadverse reduction or alteration in the nature and status\" of her\n\nemployment under the plan's change-in-control provision.            In March\n\n\n\n     1\n      Her title changed from Vice-President of Long Term Disability\nBenefits to Vice-President, Portland Customer Care as a result of\nthe merger, but a number of the job functions performed by Liston\nremained the same.\n\n                                       -2-\n\f2000, she resigned from her position at UP and requested benefits\n\npursuant to the change-in-control clause.\n\n          In April 2000, a plan official rejected her request\n\nstating that her claims, even if true, did \"not constitute a\n\nsignificant adverse alteration in the nature and status of your\n\nposition.\"      On further review, two different plan committees\n\nreached the same result.      At the final stage, Liston identified\n\nfive other officers whom she said had received benefits after their\n\njobs were altered; she had made less specific allegations to this\n\neffect at earlier points.      But the review committee at this last\n\nstage said that the benefits given to the other five employees were\n\nirrelevant to Liston because those employees were not similarly\n\nsituated to her.\n\n             In March 2001, Liston filed a complaint against the plan,\n\nthe administrator, and UP in the federal district court in Maine to\n\nobtain benefits under ERISA's civil enforcement provision, 29\n\nU.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B) (\"A civil action may be brought . . . by a\n\nparticipant or beneficiary . . . to recover benefits due to him\n\nunder the terms of his plan, [or] to enforce his rights under the\n\nterms of the plan . . .\").     Liston claimed that the defendants had\n\nacted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying her benefits even\n\nthough they had awarded them to others, and she sought discovery of\n\ndocuments pertaining to fourteen persons who had received benefits\n\n(including the five earlier identified). Liston also challenged as\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\farbitrary and capricious the administrator's rules construing the\n\nplan's change-in-control provision.\n\n           The   magistrate      judge   denied   this   discovery   request,\n\nfinding that \"a review of the merits of this particular denial . .\n\n.   is not dependent upon what happened to other officers' claims.\"\n\nThe judge noted the \"hopelessness of [the] task\" of comparing the\n\nclaims given that the court would \"be called upon to make fourteen\n\nor more separate determinations about an 'adverse reduction or\n\nalteration' in job duties.\"         The judge did allow discovery \"[t]o\n\nthe extent the decisionmakers considered claims by other officers\n\nwho [made claims under the change-in-control provisions] when\n\nconsidering plaintiff's claims.\"\n\n           The discovery order was affirmed by the district court\n\nand   Liston   then    deposed    the    plan   administrator   as   to   the\n\ninformation considered by the final review committee in rejecting\n\nListon's claim.       That deposition revealed that the claims of the\n\nother five officers cited by Liston were briefly mentioned at the\n\nmeeting (Liston having identified them), but that there was no\n\nextended discussion of the relative merits of their claims nor any\n\nreference to materials relating to their benefits determinations.\n\n           On July 17, 2002, the court granted summary judgment for\n\nthe defendants, Liston v. Unum Corp. Officer Severance Plan, 211 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 222 (D. Me. 2002), finding that the plan administrator had\n\nnot acted arbitrarily or capriciously in interpreting and applying\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fthe plan.    Liston has now appealed to this court challenging the\n\nrejection    of   her     discovery     requests,       the   administrator's\n\ninterpretive rules, and the denial of benefits to her. Because the\n\nplan reserves discretion to the administrator, judicial review of\n\nthe denial is limited to determining whether the administrator\n\nacted arbitrarily and capriciously.              Leahy v. Raytheon Co., 315\n\nF.3d 11, 15 (1st Cir. 2002).          Cf. Doe v. Travelers Ins. Co., 167\n\nF.3d 53, 56-57 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n            We begin with Liston's substantive attacks on the denial\n\nof benefits and then turn to her discovery request.                On July 6,\n\n1999,   shortly   after   the   merger      of   the   UNUM   Corporation   and\n\nProvident Companies, Inc., the plan administrator adopted a set of\n\nrules defining certain plan terms.           Recall that the plan protected\n\nthe covered officers against a change of control that resulted in\n\njob elimination and that \"a significant adverse reduction or\n\nalteration\" in the job–-even without its actual elimination--was\n\none of the triggers for benefits.           We reproduce both the pertinent\n\nplan and rule language as an appendix to this opinion.\n\n            The rules specified, inter alia, that a \"significant\n\nadverse reduction or alteration\" meant (1) the loss of a position\n\nwithout an opportunity to work elsewhere at the merged entity, (2)\n\na demotion from a \"director or manager of a major unit\" to a\n\ncontributor to that unit, or (3) a \"reduction of more than 10% of\n\nthe base salary received by the officer prior to the change in\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fcontrol.\"     Further a job was not deemed \"eliminated\" if the\n\nemployee was offered,        within 50 miles of his original location, a\n\n\"comparable position,\" namely, one\n\n            within the same functional area, which\n            requires similar skills and abilities the\n            officer utilizes in his or her current\n            position and does not result in a reduction of\n            more than 10% of the base salary he or she was\n            receiving immediately prior to the change in\n            control . . . .\n\n            One might expect Liston to argue that clause (2) is too\n\nnarrow a reading of the plan's language in a case where there is a\n\nsubstantial reduction in responsibility but no pay cut or complete\n\nloss of supervisory authority.        Instead, Liston first argues that\n\nthe rules are at odds with the plan because they deny benefits\n\nunless the employee's job is curtailed and no comparable job is\n\navailable elsewhere in the company.          She points out that the plan\n\nlanguage    defines   \"job    elimination\"   to   include   a   \"significant\n\nadverse reduction or alteration in the nature and status (other\n\nthan title) of the officer's position, duties or responsibilities\"\n\nor \"[t]he lack of any re-employment opportunity that would utilize\n\nthe officer's professional skills and abilities.\"           Thus, she says\n\nthat the rules are an unlawful amendment of the plan rather than a\n\npermissible    interpretation.2\n\n\n     2\n      In general, the plan provides that it could be amended at any\ntime. However, for obvious reasons, it also forbad any amendment\nof the change-of-control provisions within 12 months of a change of\ncontrol. The rules in question were issued within 12 months of the\nmerger.\n\n                                     -6-\n\f            Liston's position, although perhaps a literal reading of\n\nthe plan, is absurd and therefore untenable.      Rodriguez-Abreu v.\n\nChase Manhattan Bank, 986 F.2d 580, 586 (1st Cir. 1993).      On her\n\ninterpretation, an employee whose job was kept completely intact\n\nwould get benefits because no comparable position was offered; and\n\none whose job was eliminated would get benefits even though an\n\nessentially similar job was created for the employee.       Even if\n\nreview of the administrator's interpretation were de novo--it is in\n\nfact deferential, see Terry v. Bayer Corp., 145 F.3d 28, 40 (1st\n\nCir. 1998)--we would reject Liston's reading because it makes no\n\nsense.\n\n            In the alternative, Liston argues that summary judgment\n\nagainst her was mistaken because there were still material facts in\n\ndispute. She says that such disputes exist with respect to whether\n\nher old job at UP was eliminated, the manner and extent to which\n\nher post-merger job differed from her pre-merger job, and whether\n\nthe employees who received benefits under the plan were similarly\n\nsituated to her.    This challenge to summary judgment conceals a\n\npreliminary    issue,   namely,    whether   evidence   beyond   the\n\nadministrative record can be considered at all.\n\n            The ordinary rule is that review for arbitrariness is on\n\nthe record made before the entity being reviewed.    Leahy, 315 F.3d\n\nat 17-18.    True, we have declined in cases like this one to adopt\n\nan ironclad rule against new evidence.       Doe, 167 F.3d at 57-58.\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fFor example, discovery may be needed because the decisional process\n\nis too informal to provide a record.    See generally Citizens to\n\nPreserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 415-16 (1971).\n\nAnd certain kinds of claims–-e.g., proof of corruption-–may in\n\ntheir nature or timing take a reviewing court to materials outside\n\nthe administrative   record.   Cf. Perlman   v.   Swiss   Bank   Corp.\n\nComprehensive Disability Prot. Plan, 195 F.3d 975, 981-82 (7th Cir.\n\n1999).\n\n          Still, at least some very good reason is needed to\n\novercome the strong presumption that the record on review is\n\nlimited to the record before the administrator.    This is the view\n\nof virtually all of the circuits with the possible exception of the\n\nFifth Circuit.3    It is almost inherent in the idea of reviewing\n\nagency or other administrative action for reasonableness; how could\n\nan administrator act unreasonably by ignoring information never\n\npresented to it?    See Mills v. Apfel, 244 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir.\n\n\n     3\n      See, e.g., Perlman, 195 F.3d at 981-82; Wilkins v. Baptist\nHealthcare Sys., Inc., 150 F.3d 609, 616-20 (6th Cir. 1998);\nDeFelice v. Am. Int'l Life Assurance Co., 112 F.3d 61, 65 (2d Cir.\n1997); Taft v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc'y, 9 F.3d 1469, 1471-\n72 (9th Cir. 1993); Donatelli v. Home Ins. Co., 992 F.2d 763, 765\n(8th Cir. 1993); Quesinberry v. Life Ins. Co. of N. Am., 987 F.2d\n1017, 1021-27 (4th Cir. 1993) (en banc); Sandoval v. Aetna Life &\nCas. Ins. Co., 967 F.2d 377, 380 (10th Cir. 1992); Luby v.\nTeamsters Health, Welfare, and Pension Trust Funds, 944 F.2d 1176,\n1184-85 (3d Cir. 1991). But see Wildbur v. ARCO Chem. Co., 974\nF.2d 631, 636-42 (5th Cir. 1992). Liston cites two cases--Miller\nv. United Welfare Fund, 72 F.3d 1066 (2d Cir. 1995), and Milone v.\nExclusive Healthcare, Inc., 244 F.3d 615 (8th Cir. 2001)--but both\nare at odds with her position.     See Miller, 72 F.3d at 1072;\nMalone, 244 F.3d at 618.\n\n                                -8-\n\f2001), cert. denied, 122 S.Ct. 822 (2002); Taft, 9 F.3d at 1472\n\n(\"Permitting a . . . court to examine [such evidence suggests] that\n\n[an] administrator abused its discretion by failing to consider\n\nevidence not before it.\").\n\n           Even where de novo review exists under ERISA, it is at\n\nleast doubtful that courts should be in any hurry to consider\n\nevidence or claims not presented to the plan administrator.              See,\n\ne.g., Quesinberry, 987 F.2d at 1025; Wilkins, 150 F.3d at 616\n\n(Cole, J., concurring). Exhaustion of remedies principles point in\n\nthis direction even if no deference were due to the administrator's\n\ndetermination,    assuming   always      that   the   plan   empowered   the\n\nadministrator to make an initial decision.        But this is an issue on\n\nwhich    the   circuits   have   taken     different    views.      Compare\n\nQuesinberry, 987 F.2d at 1025 (only when \"clearly . . . necessary\"\n\nfor effective review) with Luby, 944 F.2d at 1184 (not providing\n\nany qualifications on when additional evidence may be considered),\n\nand we need not resolve the issue here.\n\n           Where as here review is under the arbitrariness standard,\n\nthe ordinary question is whether the administrator's action on the\n\nrecord before him was unreasonable. Cook v. Liberty Life Assurance\n\nCo. of Boston, 320 F.3d 11, 19 (1st Cir. 2003); Pari-Fasano v. ITT\n\nHartford Life & Accident Ins. Co., 230 F.3d 415, 419 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).    Liston did not seek a jury trial--and the precedents of\n\nthis and other circuits suggest that it would likely have been\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\funavailable4--so the issue here is simply whether the judge deems\n\nthe administrator's denial of benefits irrational.                Assuming that\n\nthe decision is to be made by the judge based solely on the record\n\nmade at the administrative level, summary judgment is merely a\n\nmechanism for tendering the issue and no special inferences are to\n\nbe drawn in favor of a plaintiff resisting in summary judgment; on\n\nthe contrary, the rationality standard tends to resolve doubts in\n\nfavor of the administrator.\n\n          Turning       then   to   the   merits,   Liston's      job   was   not\n\neliminated so the only serious question is whether it was so\n\ndiminished   in   its    functions    and   authority   as   to    trigger    the\n\n\"significant adverse reduction\" clause.             If the administrator's\n\nrules were read as making exclusive the three rubrics listed above,\n\nthen Liston's position would be hopeless:               her job was altered\n\nrather than eliminated; she still had supervisory authority and was\n\nnot reduced from a manager to a mere contributor to her unit; and\n\n\n     4\n      Although a few district courts have suggested that jury\ntrials are available for ERISA benefit claims under 29 U.S.C. §\n1132(a)(1)(B), Rhodes v. Piggly Wiggly Ala. Distrib. Co., 741 F.\nSupp. 1542, 1543-44 (N.D. Ala. 1990), the circuit courts to have\nconsidered the question have concluded that juries are not\navailable for such claims. E.g., Sullivan v. LTV Aerospace & Def.\nCo., 82 F.3d 1251, 1258 (2d. Cir. 1996); Borst v. Chevron Corp., 36\nF.3d 1308, 1323-24 (5th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1066\n(1995); Cox v. Keystone Carbon Co., 894 F.2d 647, 649-50 (3d Cir.),\ncert. denied, 498 U.S. 811 (1990). Our own circuit has expressly\nreserved the question, Recupero v. New England Tel. & Tel. Co., 118\nF.3d 820, 831 (1st Cir. 1997), although we have held where the case\nis decided on the administrative record and no additional evidence\nis considered, jury trials are not available. Id. at 831-32.\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fshe does not claim that her salary decreased by more than ten\n\npercent.\n\n             It is open to doubt whether the three rubrics should be\n\nread    as   exclusive   conditions    or     merely     as     safe   harbors   for\n\nsatisfying the adverse reduction clause.             Seemingly, cases falling\n\nwithin any one of the rubrics automatically trigger the clause;\n\nbut, it could well be argued, their listing does not preclude a\n\nshowing by Liston that in other respects her authority was so\n\nseverely curtailed as to trigger benefits.                    If Liston were left\n\nwith pay and title but confined to supervising one janitor, it\n\nwould be pretty hard to say that the clause was not triggered--even\n\nallowing reasonable latitude to the administrator to construe the\n\nplan.\n\n             However, there is no showing that the administrator has\n\nadopted a rigid and mechanical reading of the plan.                    While noting\n\nthat none     of   the   rubrics   applied     to    Liston's     situation,     the\n\nadministrative decision in this case ruled more broadly that\n\nListon's new position was \"comparable\" and required \"similar skills\n\nand abilities\" to her old one.               And on the facts that Liston\n\npresented     to   the   administrator       and    to   us    there    is   nothing\n\nunreasonable about the result reached by the administrator.\n\n             About the only specifics supplied by Liston are that her\n\njob and travel schedule became more demanding but these are not\n\nproof of diminished responsibility.            Beyond these changes, Liston\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fargued that she was no longer \"responsible for developing and\n\nimplementing growth and service strategies as well as piloting new\n\nwork processes.\"    Statements at this level of abstraction do not\n\nmake the administrator's ultimate decision \"arbitrary.\"\n\n           This finally brings us to, and readily explains Liston's\n\nreliance   upon,   her   remaining   argument:   that   other   officers\n\nsimilarly situated got the benefits that Liston seeks and that she\n\nwas denied an opportunity for discovery to show that this was so.\n\nBoth the administrator and the court refused to allow discovery\n\ninto how others were treated. For practical purposes, the question\n\nis whether the administrator or the court abused its discretion; in\n\nthis instance no further refinements of the respective standards of\n\nreview are necessary.5\n\n           Whether discovery was warranted depends in part on if and\n\nin what respect it matters whether others were better treated than\n\nListon, and this is not a question that has a neat mechanical\n\nanswer.    Liston's suit is for benefits that Liston says were\n\npromised to her by the plan, not a discrimination case, so the\n\ncentral issue must always be what the plan promised to Liston and\n\n\n     5\n      The administrator's obligation to avoid arbitrary and\ncapricious behavior extends to procedure as well as substance,\nPerlman, 195 F.3d at 381; and limitations on discovery in court\nproceedings are normally tested under an abuse of discretion\nstandard, though the phrasing is often very favorable to the trial\njudge.   Mack v. Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co., 871 F.2d 179, 186 (1st\nCir. 1989) (review only for a \"clear showing of manifest injustice\"\nsuch that the ruling was \"plainly wrong and resulted in substantial\nprejudice to the aggrieved party\").\n\n                                 -12-\n\fwhether the plan delivered.        Nevertheless, how others were treated\n\ncould–-in some cases–-be substantively relevant to the question\n\nwhether the administrator's construction and application of the\n\nplan to Liston was reasonable.              Mauser v. Raytheon Co. Pension\n\nPlan, 239 F.3d 51, 56-57 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n            Imagine, for example, that the plan was unclear as to\n\nwhether an officer who had served for less than three years could\n\nqualify for coverage.      Conceivably, proof that other officers who\n\nhad served only one year were regularly given benefits could\n\nrepresent an administrative construction bearing on the meaning of\n\nthe plan    and    undermine   the    reasonableness     of     a    contrary    and\n\ndisparate reading in a given case.            Mauser, 239 F.3d at 56-57.          Of\n\ncourse, the issue should be raised in the first instance during the\n\nclaims process, but here Liston did seek information about benefits\n\nfor comparably situated employees from the administrator and was\n\nrebuffed.\n\n            Still,    we   think     in    this   instance    the     rebuff     was\n\nreasonable both at the administrative and court level. Whether the\n\nplan applies to those with less than three years' seniority is\n\nordinarily a question with a yes or no answer; and it is easy to\n\ndetermine   from     records   whether       prior   practice       represents    an\n\nadministrative construction.              Liston's case is at the opposite\n\npole:   we cannot imagine that there is anyone else in the company\n\nwhose position before, and treatment after, the merger corresponds\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fin every respect to Liston's.   The plan's general standard is too\n\nvague and the variables in executive jobs are too numerous to\n\nexpect that anyone else will be identically placed.\n\n          Thus, as the magistrate judge pointed out, comparison of\n\nthe files of others who received or were denied benefits invites an\n\nopen-ended and probably hopeless attempt to compare disparate\n\nsituations–-whether impressionistically or by drawing up formulas\n\npurporting to explain the outcomes.6     The search through other\n\nrecords would have to be exhaustive; it would be only the predicate\n\nto further dispute about the significance of the information; and\n\nprobably it would not be conclusive.   Every administrative denial\n\nwould be an occasion for a vast and expensive inquiry into what\n\njudges sometimes call \"collateral issues.\"      See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Andujar, 49 F.3d 16, 26 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n          Mandating discovery in such a situation would be at odds\n\nwith the concerns about efficient administration that underlie the\n\nERISA statute itself.    See, e.g, Taft, 9 F.3d at 1472.     True,\n\nListon is handicapped by having to show that the outcome of\n\ndiscovery would be helpful before she can get access to materials\n\nthat might show just this; but this is the standard situation in\n\n\n     6\n      Liston also argues that the district judge may have granted\nsummary judgment against her without realizing the relatively\nlimited amount of information she could discover under the\nmagistrate judge's order. We have reviewed the language in the\ndistrict court opinion identified by Liston and see no such\nconfusion, particularly because the district court had already\naffirmed the magistrate judge's discovery ruling in a prior order.\n\n                                -14-\n\fdiscovery and the reason why those in charge are expected to\n\nexercise judgment.

Prior to its June 1999 merger with Provident Companies, Inc., the UNUM Corporation had adopted an officer severance plan (\"the plan\") to provide benefits for officers whose jobs were \"eliminated\" as a result of a \"change in control\" of the company. The benefits could amount to as much as 36 weeks' salary, and an officer could obtain them if any of the plan's triggering conditions were satisfied, importantly: a \"significant adverse reduction or alteration in the nature and status (other than title) of the officer's position, duties or responsibilities... within 365 days of the change in control.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the merger, Liston, who was one of several vice-presidents at UP,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> found that her obligations had increased and that her authority had diminished. She claimed that she had to work an additional 20 hours per week and travel three times more often. In addition, she said that she had less authority to make strategic and administrative decisions (<i>e.g.,</i> salary decisions for subordinates). Liston viewed these changes as a \"significant adverse reduction or alteration in the nature and status\" of her employment under the plan's change-in-control provision. In March 2000, she resigned from her position at UP and requested benefits pursuant to the change-in-control clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 2000, a plan official rejected her request stating that her claims, even if true, did \"not constitute a significant adverse alteration in the nature and status of your position.\" On further review, two different plan committees reached the same result. At the final stage, Liston identified five other officers whom she said had received benefits after their jobs were altered; she had made less specific allegations to this effect at earlier points. But the review committee at this last stage said that the benefits given to the other five employees were irrelevant to Liston because those employees were not similarly situated to her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 2001, Liston filed a complaint against the plan, the administrator, and UP in the federal district court in Maine to obtain benefits under ERISA's civil enforcement provision, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(a)(1)(B) (\"A civil action may be brought ... by a participant or beneficiary... to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan, [or] to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan ...\"). Liston claimed that the defendants had acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying her benefits even though they had awarded them to others, and she sought discovery of documents pertaining to fourteen persons who had received benefits (including the five earlier identified). Liston also challenged as arbitrary and capricious the administrator's rules construing the plan's change-in-control provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge denied this discovery request, finding that \"a review of the merits of this particular denial ... is not dependent upon what happened to other officers' claims.\" The judge noted the \"hopelessness of [the] task\" of comparing the claims given that the court would \"be called upon to make fourteen or more separate determinations about an `adverse reduction or alteration' in job duties.\" The judge did allow discovery \"[t]o the extent the decisionmakers considered claims by other officers who [made claims under the change-in-control provisions] when considering plaintiff's claims.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The discovery order was affirmed by the district court and Liston then deposed the plan administrator as to the information considered by the final review committee in rejecting Liston's claim. That deposition revealed that the claims of the other five officers cited by Liston were briefly mentioned at the meeting (Liston having identified them), but that there was no extended discussion of the relative merits of their claims nor any reference to materials relating to their benefits determinations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 17, 2002, the court granted summary judgment for the defendants, <i>Liston v. Unum Corp. Officer Severance Plan,</i> 211 F.Supp.2d 222 (D.Me.2002), finding that the plan administrator had not acted arbitrarily or capriciously in interpreting and applying the plan. Liston has now appealed to this court challenging the rejection of her discovery requests, the administrator's interpretive rules, and the denial of benefits to her. Because the plan reserves discretion to the administrator, judicial review of the denial is limited to determining whether the administrator acted arbitrarily and capriciously. <i>Leahy v. Raytheon Co.,</i> 315 F.3d 11, 15 (1st Cir. 2002). <i>Cf. Doe v. Travelers Ins. Co.,</i> 167 F.3d 53, 56-57 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with Liston's substantive attacks on the denial of benefits and then turn to her discovery request. On July 6, 1999, shortly after the merger of the UNUM Corporation and Provident Companies, Inc., the plan administrator adopted a set of rules defining certain plan terms. Recall that the plan protected the covered officers against a change of control that resulted in job elimination and that \"a significant adverse reduction or alteration\" in the job &#8212; even without its actual elimination &#8212; was one of the triggers for benefits. We reproduce both the pertinent plan and rule language as an appendix to this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rules specified, <i>inter alia,</i> that a \"significant adverse reduction or alteration\" meant (1) the loss of a position without an opportunity to work elsewhere at the merged entity, (2) a demotion from a \"director or manager of a major unit\" to a contributor to that unit, or (3) a \"reduction of more than 10% of the base salary received by the officer prior to the change in control.\" Further a job was not deemed \"eliminated\" if the employee was offered, within 50 miles of his original location, a \"comparable position,\" namely, one</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">within the same functional area, which requires similar skills and abilities the officer utilizes in his or her current position and does not result in a reduction of more than 10% of the base salary he or she was receiving immediately prior to the change in control....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One might expect Liston to argue that clause (2) is too narrow a reading of the plan's language in a case where there is a substantial reduction in responsibility but no pay cut or complete loss of supervisory authority. Instead, Liston first argues that the rules are at odds with the plan because they deny benefits unless the employee's job is curtailed <i>and</i> no comparable job is available elsewhere in the company. She points out that the plan language defines \"job elimination\" to include a \"significant adverse reduction or alteration in the nature and status (other than title) of the officer's position, duties or responsibilities\" <i>or</i> \"[t]he lack of any re-employment opportunity that would utilize the officer's professional skills and abilities.\" Thus, she says that the rules are an unlawful amendment of the plan rather than a permissible interpretation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Liston's position, although perhaps a literal reading of the plan, is absurd and therefore untenable. <i>Rodriguez-Abreu v. Chase Manhattan Bank,</i> 986 F.2d 580, 586 (1st Cir.1993). On her interpretation, an employee whose job was kept completely intact would get benefits because no comparable position was offered; and one whose job was eliminated would get benefits even though an essentially similar job was created for the employee. Even if review of the administrator's interpretation were <i>de novo</i> &#8212; it is in fact deferential, <i>see Terry v. Bayer Corp.,</i> 145 F.3d 28, 40 (1st Cir.1998) &#8212; we would reject Liston's reading because it makes no sense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the alternative, Liston argues that summary judgment against her was mistaken because there were still material facts in dispute. She says that such disputes exist with respect to whether her old job at UP was eliminated, the manner and extent to which her post-merger job differed from her pre-merger job, and whether the employees who received benefits under the plan were similarly situated to her. This challenge to summary judgment conceals a preliminary issue, namely, whether evidence beyond the administrative record can be considered at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ordinary rule is that review for arbitrariness is on the record made before the entity being reviewed. <i>Leahy,</i> 315 F.3d at 17-18. True, we have declined in cases like this one to adopt an ironclad rule against new evidence. <i>Doe,</i> 167 F.3d at 57-58. For example, discovery may be needed because the decisional process is too informal to provide a record. <i>See generally Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe,</i> 401 U.S. 402, 415-16, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971). And certain kinds of claims &#8212; <i>e.g.,</i> proof of corruption &#8212; may in their nature or timing take a reviewing court to materials outside the administrative record. <i>Cf. Perlman v. Swiss Bank Corp. Comprehensive Disability Prot. Plan,</i> 195 F.3d 975, 981-82 (7th Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, at least some very good reason is needed to overcome the strong presumption that the record on review is limited to the record before the administrator. This is the view of virtually all of the circuits with the possible exception of the Fifth Circuit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> It is almost inherent in the idea of reviewing agency or other administrative action for reasonableness; how could an administrator act unreasonably by ignoring information never presented to it? <i>See Mills v. Apfel,</i> 244 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir.2001), <i>cert. denied,</i> 534 U.S. 1085, 122 S.Ct. 822, 151 L.Ed.2d 704 (2002); <i>Taft,</i> 9 F.3d at 1472 (\"Permitting a ... court to examine [such evidence suggests] that [an] administrator abused its discretion by failing to consider evidence not before it.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even where <i>de novo</i> review exists under ERISA, it is at least doubtful that courts should be in any hurry to consider evidence or claims not presented to the plan administrator. <i>See, e.g., Quesinberry,</i> 987 F.2d at 1025; <i>Wilkins,</i> 150 F.3d at 616 (Cole, J., concurring). Exhaustion of remedies principles point in this direction even if <i>no</i> deference were due to the administrator's determination, assuming always that the plan empowered the administrator to make an initial decision. But this is an issue on which the circuits have taken different views. <i>Compare Quesinberry,</i> 987 F.2d at 1025 (only when \"clearly ... necessary\" for effective review) <i>with Luby,</i> 944 F.2d at 1184 (not providing any qualifications on when additional evidence may be considered), and we need not resolve the issue here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where as here review is under the arbitrariness standard, the ordinary question is whether the administrator's action on the record before him was unreasonable. <i>Cook v. Liberty Life Assurance Co. of Boston,</i> 320 F.3d 11, 19 (1st Cir.2003); <i>Pari-Fasano v. ITT Hartford Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co.,</i> 230 F.3d 415, 419 (1st Cir. 2000). Liston did not seek a jury trial &#8212; and the precedents of this and other circuits suggest that it would likely have been unavailable<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> &#8212; so the issue here is simply whether the judge deems the administrator's denial of benefits irrational. Assuming that the decision is to be made by the judge based solely on the record made at the administrative level, summary judgment is merely a mechanism for tendering the issue and no special inferences are to be drawn in favor of a plaintiff resisting in summary judgment; on the contrary, the rationality standard tends to resolve doubts in favor of the administrator.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning then to the merits, Liston's job was not eliminated so the only serious question is whether it was so diminished in its functions and authority as to trigger the \"significant adverse reduction\" clause. If the administrator's rules were read as making exclusive the three rubrics listed above, then Liston's position would be hopeless: her job was altered rather than eliminated; she still had supervisory authority and was not reduced from a manager to a mere contributor to her unit; and she does not claim that her salary decreased by more than ten percent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is open to doubt whether the three rubrics should be read as exclusive conditions or merely as safe harbors for satisfying the adverse reduction clause. Seemingly, cases falling within any one of the rubrics automatically trigger the clause; but, it could well be argued, their listing does not preclude a showing by Liston that in <i>other</i> respects her authority was so severely curtailed as to trigger benefits. If Liston were left with pay and title but confined to supervising one janitor, it would be pretty hard to say that the clause was not triggered &#8212; even allowing reasonable latitude to the administrator to construe the plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, there is no showing that the administrator has adopted a rigid and mechanical reading of the plan. While noting that none of the rubrics applied to Liston's situation, the administrative decision in this case ruled more broadly that Liston's new position was \"comparable\" and required \"similar skills and abilities\" to her old one. And on the <i>facts</i> that Liston presented to the administrator and to us there is nothing unreasonable about the result reached by the administrator.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About the only specifics supplied by Liston are that her job and travel schedule became more demanding but these are not proof of diminished responsibility. Beyond these changes, Liston argued that she was no longer \"responsible for developing and implementing growth and service strategies as well as piloting new work processes.\" Statements at this level of abstraction do not make the administrator's ultimate decision \"arbitrary.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This finally brings us to, and readily explains Liston's reliance upon, her remaining argument: that other officers similarly situated got the benefits that Liston seeks and that she was denied an opportunity for discovery to show that this was so. Both the administrator and the court refused to allow discovery into how others were treated. For practical purposes, the question is whether the administrator or the court abused its discretion; in this instance no further refinements of the respective standards of review are necessary.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether discovery was warranted depends in part on if and in what respect <i>it matters</i> whether others were better treated than Liston, and this is not a question that has a neat mechanical answer. Liston's suit is for benefits that Liston says were promised to her by the plan, not a discrimination case, so the central issue must always be what the plan promised to Liston and whether the plan delivered. Nevertheless, how others were treated could &#8212; in some cases &#8212; be substantively relevant to the question whether the administrator's construction and application of the plan to Liston was reasonable. <i>Mauser v. Raytheon Co. Pension Plan,</i> 239 F.3d 51, 56-57 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Imagine, for example, that the plan was unclear as to whether an officer who had served for less than three years could qualify for coverage. Conceivably, proof that other officers who had served only one year were regularly given benefits could represent an administrative construction bearing on the meaning of the plan and undermine the reasonableness of a contrary and disparate reading in a given case. <i>Mauser,</i> 239 F.3d at 56-57. Of course, the issue should be raised in the first instance during the claims process, but here Liston did seek information about benefits for comparably situated employees from the administrator and was rebuffed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, we think in this instance the rebuff was reasonable both at the administrative and court level. Whether the plan applies to those with less than three years' seniority is ordinarily a question with a yes or no answer; and it is easy to determine from records whether prior practice represents an administrative construction. Liston's case is at the opposite pole: we cannot imagine that there is anyone else in the company whose position before, and treatment after, the merger corresponds in every respect to Liston's. The plan's general standard is too vague and the variables in executive jobs are too numerous to expect that anyone else will be identically placed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, as the magistrate judge pointed out, comparison of the files of others who received or were denied benefits invites an open-ended and probably hopeless attempt to compare disparate situations &#8212; whether impressionistically or by drawing up formulas purporting to explain the outcomes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The search through other records would have to be exhaustive; it would be only the predicate to further dispute about the significance of the information; and probably it would not be conclusive. Every administrative denial would be an occasion for a vast and expensive inquiry into what judges sometimes call \"collateral issues.\" <i>See, e.g., United States v.

Prior to its June 1999 merger with Provident Companies, Inc., the UNUM Corporation had adopted an officer severance plan (\"the plan\") to provide benefits for officers whose jobs were \"eliminated\" as a result of a \"change in control\" of the company. The benefits could amount to as much as 36 weeks' salary, and an officer could obtain them if any of the plan's triggering conditions were satisfied, importantly: a \"significant adverse reduction or alteration in the nature and status (other than title) of the officer's position, duties or responsibilities... within 365 days of the change in control.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the merger, Liston, who was one of several vice-presidents at UP,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> found that her obligations had increased and that her authority had diminished. She claimed that she had to work an additional 20 hours per week and travel three times more often. In addition, she said that she had less authority to make strategic and administrative decisions (<i>e.g.,</i> salary decisions for subordinates). Liston viewed these changes as a \"significant adverse reduction or alteration in the nature and status\" of her employment under the plan's change-in-control provision. In March 2000, she resigned from her position at UP and requested benefits pursuant to the change-in-control clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 2000, a plan official rejected her request stating that her claims, even if true, did \"not constitute a significant adverse alteration in the nature and status of your position.\" On further review, two different plan committees reached the same result. At the final stage, Liston identified five other officers whom she said had received benefits after their jobs were altered; she had made less specific allegations to this effect at earlier points. But the review committee at this last stage said that the benefits given to the other five employees were irrelevant to Liston because those employees were not similarly situated to her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 2001, Liston filed a complaint against the plan, the administrator, and UP in the federal district court in Maine to obtain benefits under ERISA's civil enforcement provision, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(a)(1)(B) (\"A civil action may be brought ... by a participant or beneficiary... to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan, [or] to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan ...\"). Liston claimed that the defendants had acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying her benefits even though they had awarded them to others, and she sought discovery of documents pertaining to fourteen persons who had received benefits (including the five earlier identified). Liston also challenged as arbitrary and capricious the administrator's rules construing the plan's change-in-control provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge denied this discovery request, finding that \"a review of the merits of this particular denial ... is not dependent upon what happened to other officers' claims.\" The judge noted the \"hopelessness of [the] task\" of comparing the claims given that the court would \"be called upon to make fourteen or more separate determinations about an `adverse reduction or alteration' in job duties.\" The judge did allow discovery \"[t]o the extent the decisionmakers considered claims by other officers who [made claims under the change-in-control provisions] when considering plaintiff's claims.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The discovery order was affirmed by the district court and Liston then deposed the plan administrator as to the information considered by the final review committee in rejecting Liston's claim. That deposition revealed that the claims of the other five officers cited by Liston were briefly mentioned at the meeting (Liston having identified them), but that there was no extended discussion of the relative merits of their claims nor any reference to materials relating to their benefits determinations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 17, 2002, the court granted summary judgment for the defendants, <i>Liston v.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">222</span></a></span> (D.Me.2002), finding that the plan administrator had not acted arbitrarily or capriciously in interpreting and applying the plan. Liston has now appealed to this court challenging the rejection of her discovery requests, the administrator's interpretive rules, and the denial of benefits to her. Because the plan reserves discretion to the administrator, judicial review of the denial is limited to determining whether the administrator acted arbitrarily and capriciously. <i>Leahy v.

On July 6, 1999, shortly after the merger of the UNUM Corporation and Provident Companies, Inc., the plan administrator adopted a set of rules defining certain plan terms. Recall that the plan protected the covered officers against a change of control that resulted in job elimination and that \"a significant adverse reduction or alteration\" in the job &#8212; even without its actual elimination &#8212; was one of the triggers for benefits. We reproduce both the pertinent plan and rule language as an appendix to this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rules specified, <i>inter alia,</i> that a \"significant adverse reduction or alteration\" meant (1) the loss of a position without an opportunity to work elsewhere at the merged entity, (2) a demotion from a \"director or manager of a major unit\" to a contributor to that unit, or (3) a \"reduction of more than 10% of the base salary received by the officer prior to the change in control.\" Further a job was not deemed \"eliminated\" if the employee was offered, within 50 miles of his original location, a \"comparable position,\" namely, one</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">within the same functional area, which requires similar skills and abilities the officer utilizes in his or her current position and does not result in a reduction of more than 10% of the base salary he or she was receiving immediately prior to the change in control....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One might expect Liston to argue that clause (2) is too narrow a reading of the plan's language in a case where there is a substantial reduction in responsibility but no pay cut or complete loss of supervisory authority. Instead, Liston first argues that the rules are at odds with the plan because they deny benefits unless the employee's job is curtailed <i>and</i> no comparable job is available elsewhere in the company. She points out that the plan language defines \"job elimination\" to include a \"significant adverse reduction or alteration in the nature and status (other than title) of the officer's position, duties or responsibilities\" <i>or</i> \"[t]he lack of any re-employment opportunity that would utilize the officer's professional skills and abilities.\" Thus, she says that the rules are an unlawful amendment of the plan rather than a permissible interpretation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Liston's position, although perhaps a literal reading of the plan, is absurd and therefore untenable. <i>Rodriguez-Abreu v. Chase Manhattan Bank,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600732\"><a href=\"/opinion/600732/luis-e-rodriguez-abreu-v-the-chase-manhattan-bank-na/\"><span class=\"volume\">986</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">580</span></a></span>, 586 (1st Cir.1993). On her interpretation, an employee whose job was kept completely intact would get benefits because no comparable position was offered; and one whose job was eliminated would get benefits even though an essentially similar job was created for the employee. Even if review of the administrator's interpretation were <i>de novo</i> &#8212; it is in fact deferential, <i>see Terry v. Bayer Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"754634\"><a href=\"/opinion/754634/michael-f-terry-v-bayer-corporation-and-bayer-corporation-disability-plan/\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span>, 40 (1st Cir.1998) &#8212; we would reject Liston's reading because it makes no sense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the alternative, Liston argues that summary judgment against her was mistaken because there were still material facts in dispute. She says that such disputes exist with respect to whether her old job at UP was eliminated, the manner and extent to which her post-merger job differed from her pre-merger job, and whether the employees who received benefits under the plan were similarly situated to her. This challenge to summary judgment conceals a preliminary issue, namely, whether evidence beyond the administrative record can be considered at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ordinary rule is that review for arbitrariness is on the record made before the entity being reviewed. <i>Leahy,</i> 315 F.3d at 17-18. True, we have declined in cases like this one to adopt an ironclad rule against new evidence. <i>Doe,</i> 167 F.3d at 57-58. For example, discovery may be needed because the decisional process is too informal to provide a record. <i>See generally Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108283\"><a href=\"/opinion/108283/citizens-to-preserve-overton-park-inc-v-volpe/\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">402</span></a></span>, 415-16, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108283\"><a href=\"/opinion/108283/citizens-to-preserve-overton-park-inc-v-volpe/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">136</span></a></span> (1971). And certain kinds of claims &#8212; <i>e.g.,</i> proof of corruption &#8212; may in their nature or timing take a reviewing court to materials outside the administrative record. <i>Cf. Perlman v. Swiss Bank Corp. Comprehensive Disability Prot.

This is the view of virtually all of the circuits with the possible exception of the Fifth Circuit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> It is almost inherent in the idea of reviewing agency or other administrative action for reasonableness; how could an administrator act unreasonably by ignoring information never presented to it? <i>See Mills v.

Exhaustion of remedies principles point in this direction even if <i>no</i> deference were due to the administrator's determination, assuming always that the plan empowered the administrator to make an initial decision. But this is an issue on which the circuits have taken different views. <i>Compare Quesinberry,</i> 987 F.2d at 1025 (only when \"clearly ... necessary\" for effective review) <i>with Luby,</i> 944 F.2d at 1184 (not providing any qualifications on when additional evidence may be considered), and we need not resolve the issue here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where as here review is under the arbitrariness standard, the ordinary question is whether the administrator's action on the record before him was unreasonable. <i>Cook v. Liberty Life Assurance Co. of Boston,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">320</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></span>, 19 (1st Cir.2003); <i>Pari-Fasano v. ITT Hartford Life &amp; Accident Ins.

Liston did not seek a jury trial &#8212; and the precedents of this and other circuits suggest that it would likely have been unavailable<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> &#8212; so the issue here is simply whether the judge deems the administrator's denial of benefits irrational. Assuming that the decision is to be made by the judge based solely on the record made at the administrative level, summary judgment is merely a mechanism for tendering the issue and no special inferences are to be drawn in favor of a plaintiff resisting in summary judgment; on the contrary, the rationality standard tends to resolve doubts in favor of the administrator.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning then to the merits, Liston's job was not eliminated so the only serious question is whether it was so diminished in its functions and authority as to trigger the \"significant adverse reduction\" clause. If the administrator's rules were read as making exclusive the three rubrics listed above, then Liston's position would be hopeless: her job was altered rather than eliminated; she still had supervisory authority and was not reduced from a manager to a mere contributor to her unit; and she does not claim that her salary decreased by more than ten percent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is open to doubt whether the three rubrics should be read as exclusive conditions or merely as safe harbors for satisfying the adverse reduction clause. Seemingly, cases falling within any one of the rubrics automatically trigger the clause; but, it could well be argued, their listing does not preclude a showing by Liston that in <i>other</i> respects her authority was so severely curtailed as to trigger benefits. If Liston were left with pay and title but confined to supervising one janitor, it would be pretty hard to say that the clause was not triggered &#8212; even allowing reasonable latitude to the administrator to construe the plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, there is no showing that the administrator has adopted a rigid and mechanical reading of the plan. While noting that none of the rubrics applied to Liston's situation, the administrative decision in this case ruled more broadly that Liston's new position was \"comparable\" and required \"similar skills and abilities\" to her old one. And on the <i>facts</i> that Liston presented to the administrator and to us there is nothing unreasonable about the result reached by the administrator.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About the only specifics supplied by Liston are that her job and travel schedule became more demanding but these are not proof of diminished responsibility. Beyond these changes, Liston argued that she was no longer \"responsible for developing and implementing growth and service strategies as well as piloting new work processes.\" Statements at this level of abstraction do not make the administrator's ultimate decision \"arbitrary.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This finally brings us to, and readily explains Liston's reliance upon, her remaining argument: that other officers similarly situated got the benefits that Liston seeks and that she was denied an opportunity for discovery to show that this was so. Both the administrator and the court refused to allow discovery into how others were treated. For practical purposes, the question is whether the administrator or the court abused its discretion; in this instance no further refinements of the respective standards of review are necessary.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether discovery was warranted depends in part on if and in what respect <i>it matters</i> whether others were better treated than Liston, and this is not a question that has a neat mechanical answer. Liston's suit is for benefits that Liston says were promised to her by the plan, not a discrimination case, so the central issue must always be what the plan promised to Liston and whether the plan delivered. Nevertheless, how others were treated could &#8212; in some cases &#8212; be substantively relevant to the question whether the administrator's construction and application of the plan to Liston was reasonable. <i>Mauser v. Raytheon Co. Pension Plan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771953\"><a href=\"/opinion/771953/gary-b-mauser-appellantcross-appellee-v-raytheon-company-pension-plan/\"><span class=\"volume\">239</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span>, 56-57 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Imagine, for example, that the plan was unclear as to whether an officer who had served for less than three years could qualify for coverage. Conceivably, proof that other officers who had served only one year were regularly given benefits could represent an administrative construction bearing on the meaning of the plan and undermine the reasonableness of a contrary and disparate reading in a given case. <i>Mauser,</i> 239 F.3d at 56-57. Of course, the issue should be raised in the first instance during the claims process, but here Liston did seek information about benefits for comparably situated employees from the administrator and was rebuffed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, we think in this instance the rebuff was reasonable both at the administrative and court level. Whether the plan applies to those with less than three years' seniority is ordinarily a question with a yes or no answer; and it is easy to determine from records whether prior practice represents an administrative construction. Liston's case is at the opposite pole: we cannot imagine that there is anyone else in the company whose position before, and treatment after, the merger corresponds in every respect to Liston's. The plan's general standard is too vague and the variables in executive jobs are too numerous to expect that anyone else will be identically placed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, as the magistrate judge pointed out, comparison of the files of others who received or were denied benefits invites an open-ended and probably hopeless attempt to compare disparate situations &#8212; whether impressionistically or by drawing up formulas purporting to explain the outcomes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The search through other records would have to be exhaustive; it would be only the predicate to further dispute about the significance of the information; and probably it would not be conclusive. Every administrative denial would be an occasion for a vast and expensive inquiry into what judges sometimes call \"collateral issues.\" <i>See, e.g., United States v. Andujar,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195947\"><a href=\"/opinion/195947/united-states-v-andujar/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mandating discovery in such a situation would be at odds with the concerns about efficient administration that underlie the ERISA statute itself. <i>See, e.g, Taft,</i> 9 F.3d at 1472. True, Liston is handicapped by having to show that the outcome of discovery would be helpful before she can get access to materials that might show just this; but this is the standard situation in discovery and the reason why those in charge are expected to exercise judgment. <i>Fennell v. First Step Designs, Ltd.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"718191\"><a href=\"/opinion/718191/70-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1305-34-fedrserv3d-1566-rachel-l-fennell/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">526</span></a></span>, 532 (1st Cir.1996).
