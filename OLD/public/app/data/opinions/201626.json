Julia Agustien Kandio is a native and\n\ncitizen of Indonesia who entered the United States on September 22,\n\n1991.     She stayed beyond the expiration of her temporary visa on\n\nMarch 21, 1992, and on July 9, 2001, filed an application for\n\nasylum    and    withholding       of   removal,      which    was    denied.     The\n\nImmigration and Naturalization Service issued a Notice to Appear on\n\nNovember 15, 2001, charging her with removability under 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1227(a)(1)(B) (2000) as a nonimmigrant alien who remained in the\n\nUnited States longer than permitted.              Kandio conceded removability\n\nbut   sought     relief    on    the    ground    that   she    feared    religious\n\npersecution for being Christian.\n\n            At    her    removal    hearing      on   January    8,    2002,    Kandio\n\ntestified that members of her principally Muslim community in\n\nIndonesia threatened Christians and once ransacked her home, that\n\nher   husband’s    family       harassed    her    and   her    husband    (who   had\n\nconverted to Christianity) because of their faith, and that she\n\ncame to the United States with her son when the family threatened\n\nto kill him if he became a confirmed Christian.                         Her husband\n\nremained in Indonesia.          Kandio testified that she learned from her\n\nown     family   about    escalating       “problems”     between      Muslims     and\n\nChristians starting in 1998, and that they told her that they were\n\nafraid to go to church and that it was not safe for her to return\n\nto Indonesia.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\f           At the conclusion of the hearing, the immigration judge\n\ndetermined that Kandio was ineligible for asylum because her\n\napplication was not timely.     The judge also denied her application\n\nfor withholding of removal.         Although he found Kandio to be\n\ncredible, he found that she failed to establish a clear probability\n\nof persecution if she returned to Indonesia.\n\n           Kandio   filed   a   notice   of   appeal   to   the    Board    of\n\nImmigration Appeals (“Board”) on January 10, 2002, indicating that\n\nshe would file a brief for the appeal.           After her attorney was\n\ngranted one extension for filing a brief, a second extension\n\nrequest was denied on August 5, 2002, and on August 7, 2003, the\n\nBoard   summarily   dismissed   Kandio’s      appeal   under   8   C.F.R.    §\n\n1003.1(d)(2)(i)(E), for failing to file a brief without adequate\n\nexplanation.\n\n           Kandio timely filed a motion before the Board to reopen\n\nthe proceedings.     Supporting the motion was an affidavit from\n\nKandio’s cousin stating that the husband’s family had (when Kandio\n\nwas in Indonesia) threatened to kill Kandio and her son; letters\n\nfrom Kandio’s parents and a friend describing attacks and threats\n\nagainst Christians, and saying that “people” were searching for\n\nKandio; as well as a number of articles describing Indonesian\n\nreligious strife.   On April 8, 2004, the Board denied the motion to\n\nreopen, despite finding that the new evidence was material and not\n\npreviously available.   The Board concluded that the motion did not\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fcure her untimely asylum application, and that the evidence (old\n\nand new) did not establish that she was more likely than not to be\n\npersecuted or tortured because she failed to establish that the\n\nthreat “exists on a country-wide basis.”\n\n              Kandia filed a second motion to reopen with the Board on\n\nJuly 8, 2004, that included certificates of her parents’ death and\n\nher sister’s hospitalization, a letter saying that the sister had\n\nsuffered mental distress because of conditions in Indonesia, and\n\nother background materials.           The Board denied her motion on August\n\n17, holding that Kandio’s second motion both exceeded the maximum\n\nnumber   of       motions    to   reopen--which   is   one,    see    8   C.F.R.    §\n\n1003.2(c)(2)--and was also untimely, being filed more than 90 days,\n\nsee id., after the Board’s final order on August 7, 2003.\n\n              The Board also held that the exception of 8 C.F.R. §\n\n1003.2(c)(3)(ii)--permitting an additional motion to reopen based\n\non newly available material evidence of changed circumstances in\n\nthe country--was inapplicable because the information about her\n\nfamily only amounted to changed personal circumstances.                    It also\n\nconcluded     that     the    background    evidence   of     “some    attacks     on\n\nChristian      churches,      and    some   fighting   between        Muslims    and\n\nChristians” did not remedy her untimely asylum application and did\n\nnot show      a    “clear    probability    of   persecution”    or    torture     in\n\nIndonesia.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\f          Kandio filed a petition for review in this court on\n\nSeptember 16, 2004, which was timely as to her second motion to\n\nreopen.   However, she did not file a petition for review within\n\nthirty days    either   of   the   Board’s   initial   affirmance   of   the\n\nimmigration judge’s decision, or of its denial of her first motion\n\nto reopen.     “All final [Board] orders must be appealed to this\n\ncourt within 30 days.”       Ven v. Ashcroft, 386 F.3d 357, 359 (1st\n\nCir. 2004); see 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(1).          “A motion to reopen or\n\nreconsider does not toll the period for filing a petition for\n\njudicial review of the underlying order”; rather, “the time to\n\nappeal denial orders continues to run despite the filing of motions\n\nto reopen or reconsider.”     Ven, 386 F.3d at 359-60; see also Zhang\n\nv. INS, 348 F.3d 289, 292 (1st Cir. 2003).         As a result, we lack\n\njurisdiction to review either the Board’s initial affirmance or its\n\ndenial of Kandio’s first motion to reopen proceedings.              See De\n\nAraujo v. Ashcroft, 399 F.3d 84, 88 (1st Cir. 2005); Zhang, 348\n\nF.3d at 292.\n\n          We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of\n\ndiscretion. Jupiter v. Ashcroft, 396 F.3d 487, 490 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(“regardless of the substantive claim involved”); Maindrond v.\n\nAshcroft, 385 F.3d 98, 100 (1st Cir. 2004).        To survive the bar on\n\nmultiple or late motions to reopen, the petitioner’s motion must be\n\n“based on changed circumstances arising in the country . . . if\n\nsuch evidence is material and was not available and could not have\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fbeen discovered or presented at the previous hearing.”        8 C.F.R. §\n\n1003.2(c)(3)(ii).       We agree with the Board that the death of\n\nKandio’s parents was a matter of personal circumstances and did not\n\nestablish changed circumstances in Indonesia relevant to Kandio’s\n\nrelief.\n\n            The remaining material is the documentation purporting to\n\nestablish that Kandio’s sister suffered a stroke caused by the\n\nsituation in Indonesia; several articles describing attacks on five\n\nChristian churches (including the destruction of church property\n\nand the beating of a pastor and a church member) in June 2004;\n\ndescriptions of regulatory restrictions on churches along with some\n\nchurch closings and threats in March and April of 2004; an article\n\ndescribing sectarian fighting in a city in the Malaku islands that\n\nkilled 37 people in spring 2004; and several articles dated in 2002\n\ndescribing violence during the period from 1999 to 2002, including\n\nanti-Christian violence in 2000 and 2001 in the Malaku Islands\n\nduring which 15,000 Christians were reportedly killed.\n\n            The Board did not abuse its discretion in finding that\n\nKandio’s evidence was inadequate to provide her relief: one part of\n\nthe background material described only scattered incidents of\n\nviolence against several churches and their members (as well as\n\nproviding    somewhat    vague   accounts   of   tightening   regulatory\n\nrestrictions) that reflected, at most, a continuation of the kinds\n\nof circumstances that the Board had previously considered; the\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fother part described more serious violence, but this violence was\n\nseveral years in the past and evidence of those conditions (if even\n\nstill   relevant)    could   have    been   provided    earlier.     Kandio’s\n\nsister’s illness is primarily a personal circumstance.                     This\n\nevidence    is   insufficient   to    establish   the    requisite   changed\n\nconditions.\n\n            The rest of Kandio’s claims on this appeal are attacks\n\nupon the affirmance of the immigration judge’s removal decision and\n\nthe Board’s denial of her first motion to reopen (and include a\n\nmeritless   attack   on   alleged    procedural   irregularities      in    her\n\nproceeding), and are therefore beyond our jurisdictional purview\n\nnow.\n\n            The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f",

We agree with the Board that the death of\n\nKandio’s parents was a matter of personal circumstances and did not\n\nestablish changed circumstances in Indonesia relevant to Kandio’s\n\nrelief.\n\n            The remaining material is the documentation purporting to\n\nestablish that Kandio’s sister suffered a stroke caused by the\n\nsituation in Indonesia; several articles describing attacks on five\n\nChristian churches (including the destruction of church property\n\nand the beating of a pastor and a church member) in June 2004;\n\ndescriptions of regulatory restrictions on churches along with some\n\nchurch closings and threats in March and April of 2004; an article\n\ndescribing sectarian fighting in a city in the Malaku islands that\n\nkilled 37 people in spring 2004; and several articles dated in 2002\n\ndescribing violence during the period from 1999 to 2002, including\n\nanti-Christian violence in 2000 and 2001 in the Malaku Islands\n\nduring which 15,000 Christians were reportedly killed.\n\n            The Board did not abuse its discretion in finding that\n\nKandio’s evidence was inadequate to provide her relief: one part of\n\nthe background material described only scattered incidents of\n\nviolence against several churches and their members (as well as\n\nproviding    somewhat    vague   accounts   of   tightening   regulatory\n\nrestrictions) that reflected, at most, a continuation of the kinds\n\nof circumstances that the Board had previously considered; the\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fother part described more serious violence, but this violence was\n\nseveral years in the past and evidence of those conditions (if even\n\nstill   relevant)    could   have    been   provided    earlier.     Kandio’s\n\nsister’s illness is primarily a personal circumstance.                     This\n\nevidence    is   insufficient   to    establish   the    requisite   changed\n\nconditions.\n\n            The rest of Kandio’s claims on this appeal are attacks\n\nupon the affirmance of the immigration judge’s removal decision and\n\nthe Board’s denial of her first motion to reopen (and include a\n\nmeritless   attack   on   alleged    procedural   irregularities      in    her\n\nproceeding), and are therefore beyond our jurisdictional purview\n\nnow.\n\n            The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f</pre>",
