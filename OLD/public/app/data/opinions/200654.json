Nathaniel M. Gorton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                      Boudin, Chief Judge,\n               Lynch and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Mussa M. Ali on brief pro se.\n     Geoffrey B.

Pro se plaintiff-appellant Mussa M. Ali\n\n(\"Ali\") appeals          the   grant   of      summary    judgment    in   favor   of\n\ndefendants-appellees, the University of Massachusetts Medical\n\nCenter (the \"University\") and seven of its employees.                      We review\n\nthe grant of summary judgment de novo, examining the record\n\nindependently and drawing any factual inferences in the light\n\nmost favorable to the non-movant. Gu v. Boston Police Dep't, 312\n\nF.3d 6, 10 (1st Cir. 2002).                    After carefully reviewing the\n\nparties' briefs and the record, we affirm the grant of summary\n\njudgment substantially for the reasons stated in the district\n\ncourt's September 23, 2002 memorandum and order. We add only the\n\nfollowing comments.\n\n               With respect to Ali's claim under Title VI of the Civil\n\nRights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000d, we agree with Ali that\n\nthere    appear     to    be    genuine     factual       issues     regarding     the\n\nUniversity's purported denial of Ali's 1993 and 1994 applications\n\nfor admission to the University's medical school based on Ali's\n\nresidency status.          We agree with the district court, however,\n\nthat     the    University      articulated        another     legitimate,       non-\n\ndiscriminatory reason for not admitting Ali to the medical school\n\nduring     those    years      (that      he    was      out-competed      by    other\n\napplicants), and that Ali was not able to refute this other\n\nexplanation.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\f               We also agree with the district court that Ali's\n\nassertions of discrimination and unlawful action by various\n\nUniversity employees were either unsupported or insufficient to\n\nwithstand summary judgment.              We have repeatedly held that \"a\n\nsummary    judgment       motion      cannot    be   defeated   by   conclusory\n\nallegations,       harsh     invective,         empty    rhetoric,     strained\n\ninferences, or unsupported conjecture.\"                  Collier v. City of\n\nChicopee, 158 F.3d 601, 604 (1st Cir. 1998).                     Although Ali\n\nappears to truly believe that he was discriminated against by the\n\nUniversity and its employees, his perception is not evidence.\n\nPilgrim v. Trustees of Tufts College, 118 F.3d 864, 871 (1st Cir.\n\n1997) (noting that a plaintiff's \"[subjective] perception is not\n\nevidence\" of discriminatory intent, and, hence, \"not enough to\n\nwithstand summary judgment\").\n\n               Ali's contention that the district court invaded the\n\nprovince of the jury by deciding questions of intent and motive\n\nhas no merit.        \"Even in cases where elusive concepts such as\n\nmotive    or     intent    are   at    issue,    summary   judgment    may   be\n\nappropriate if the nonmoving party rests merely upon conclusory\n\nallegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation.\"\n\nMedina-Munoz v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 896 F.2d 5, 8 (1st\n\nCir. 1990).\n\n               Ali also argues on appeal that he was prejudiced in the\n\npresentation of his case because the district court failed to\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\freduce to writing its order on his motion to compel discovery\n\nfrom the defendants.   This argument is waived because Ali failed\n\nto timely seek clarification of the challenged ruling.   Ali did\n\nnot seek any clarification or make any objection at the time that\n\nthe court ruled on his motion to compel.   Indeed, the first time\n\nAli requested clarification of the court's ruling was in a post-\n\njudgment motion after he had lost his case.   See K-Mart Corp. v.\n\nOriental Plaza, Inc., 875 F.2d 907, 913 (1st Cir. 1989) (holding\n\nthat appellant waived argument by not making timely objection).\n\n          Ali's claim of judicial bias is similarly waived.   Ali\n\ndid not make any claim of bias while his case was pending, or\n\neven in his multiple motions for reconsideration.     It was not\n\nuntil these post-judgment motions were denied that Ali filed two\n\nmotions seeking to have the district judge recused from the case.\n\nA party may not wait to see what outcome he receives in a case\n\nbefore asserting a claim of judicial bias.    Rodriguez-Hernandez\n\nv. Miranda-Velez, 132 F.3d 848, 857 (1st Cir. 1998) (noting that\n\n\"[c]laims of judicial partiality must be raised at the earliest\n\nmoment that a litigant becomes cognizant of the purported bias\").\n\nMoreover, the record does not support Ali's claim of bias.\n\n          Finally, with respect to Ali's motion to incorporate\n\ndocuments, the documents which were presented to the district\n\ncourt, and which form part of the record, have been considered.\n\nTo the extent Ali is attempting to submit documents which were\n\n\n                               -4-\n\fnot, but could have been, presented to the district court, he has\n\nwaived his right to present the new evidence on appeal.   See In\n\nre Colonial Mortgage Bankers Corp., 186 F.3d 46, 50 (1st Cir.\n\n1999) (noting that new evidence proffered by appellant which\n\ncould have been, but was not, presented to trier of fact cannot\n\nbe considered on appeal).\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -5-\n\f",
