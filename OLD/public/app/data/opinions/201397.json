This case raises issues of first\n\nimpression in immigration law as to the validity of a regulation\n\npromulgated    in    1997       by   the    Attorney    General,    8     C.F.R.   §\n\n245.1(c)(8). The regulation redefines certain aliens as ineligible\n\nto apply for adjustment of status to lawful permanent residents\n\nwhom a statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a), defines as eligible to apply.\n\nUnder that regulation, the Attorney General will not consider an\n\napplication for adjustment of status from the entire category of\n\naliens who have been granted parole status but have been placed in\n\nremoval proceedings.\n\n            The essence of the Attorney General's argument is that\n\nsince he has been given ultimate discretion to deny adjustment of\n\nstatus after application, the validity of the regulation is itself\n\nnot subject to judicial review, and, if it were, the regulation\n\nmust   be   upheld   as     a    permissible     exercise   of     that    ultimate\n\ndiscretion.    We disagree on both points.             We hold that there is no\n\nstatutory bar to review and that the regulation is contrary to the\n\nlanguage and intent of the statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a).                       As a\n\nresult, we vacate the order removing Wissam Succar from the United\n\nStates and remand for further proceedings.\n\n            Our reasons, which we explain in more depth below, are as\n\nfollows.    The mere fact that a statute gives the Attorney General\n\ndiscretion as to whether to grant relief after application does not\n\nby itself give the Attorney General the discretion to define\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\feligibility for such relief.              That is clear from INS v. Cardoza-\n\nFonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 443 (1987). Courts must still interpret the\n\nstatute.      Where the statute is silent on eligibility, the agency\n\ninvolved may reasonably choose to exercise its discretion to\n\nwithhold relief by excluding certain persons from eligibility for\n\nsuch relief.        Lopez v. Davis, 531 U.S. 230 (2001).\n\n              Here, the statute is not silent -- it defines persons who\n\nhave parole status as eligible for adjustment of status and does\n\nnot   carve    out    an   exception      for   parolees    who   are    in    removal\n\nproceedings.        See 8 U.S.C. § 1255.          That lack of a carve out for\n\nparolees in removal proceedings is itself significant, given that\n\nthe statute contains a number of carve outs as to eligibility for\n\nadjustment     of     status.      Some   carve    outs    exclude   persons      from\n\neligibility      to      apply   who   would    otherwise    meet    more      general\n\neligibility     requirements.           Further,    other    carve      outs    create\n\neligibility in persons otherwise ineligible.                  Congress thus has\n\ncreated a comprehensive scheme.\n\n              Viewing the larger statutory context, we find Congress\n\nhas also been explicit about where the Attorney General has been\n\ngranted discretion and where he has not.                  By contrast with other\n\nareas, there        is    no   explicit   grant    of   discretion      to    redefine\n\neligibility to apply for adjustment of status of parolees to\n\nexclude those in removal proceedings.               Congress did not place the\n\ndecision as to which applicants for admission are placed in removal\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fproceedings into the discretion of the Attorney General, but\n\ncreated mandatory criteria.    See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1225(b)(1), (2).   In\n\naddition, persons cannot be granted paroled status at all if they\n\npose a security risk; they are to be ordered removed and this order\n\nmust be reported to the Attorney General.    8 U.S.C. § 1255(c)(1).\n\n          The    statutory    scheme   reflects   Congress's careful\n\nbalancing of the country's security needs against the national\n\ninterests Congress wished to advance through adjustment of status\n\nproceedings.    The regulation upsets the balance Congress created.\n\n          Checking our construction of the statute against the\n\nlegislative history of section 1255, we find the regulation to be\n\ninconsistent with the intent expressed in the statute.      In 1960,\n\nwhen Congress included paroled aliens as aliens who are eligible\n\nfor adjustment of status relief through section 1255, it did so to\n\nsolve certain problems, which we describe later. The effect of the\n\nregulation is to re-institute the problems Congress wished to\n\nsolve. Further, until the 1997 promulgation of the regulation, the\n\nAttorney General had consistently interpreted section 1255 in a\n\nmanner consistent with the statute and the legislative history and\n\ninconsistent with the 1997 regulation.\n\n          In response to the Attorney General's argument that the\n\n1996 enactment of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant\n\nResponsibility Act (IIRIRA) justifies the 1997 regulation, we note\n\nthe Attorney General's concession that IIRIRA, which altered so\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fmuch of the immigration laws, left untouched the language of\n\nsection 1255, as enacted in 1960, on the matter in question.                      That\n\nbeing      so,    the     relevance   of   the     Attorney    General's    remaining\n\narguments, largely based on general policy said to be embodied in\n\nIIRIRA, is doubtful.            To the contrary, IIRIRA tends to strengthen,\n\nnot weaken, the petitioner's claim that the regulation is invalid.\n\nFinally, the purported policy justifications of expediting removal\n\nof   aliens        and    administrative       ease    must    give   way   to    clear\n\ncongressional intent.\n\n                                             I.\n\n                 Wissam Succar is a native and citizen of Lebanon. Succar\n\narrived at Miami International Airport on October 21, 1998, when\n\nhis flight from Lebanon to Panama stopped in the United States.                      He\n\napproached an official at the airport, stating that he wished to\n\napply for asylum.\n\n                 An immigration officer questioned Succar at the airport.\n\nBecause Succar did not have the proper documentation for admission,\n\nhe   was    taken        into   government    custody    and   held   at    the   Krome\n\ndetention facility in Miami, Florida.                    An asylum pre-screening\n\nofficer met with Succar on November 19, 1998, and determined that\n\nhe had a credible fear of persecution based on his involvement with\n\nthe Christian militias in Lebanon.                    The officer found that the\n\nfacts as recounted by Succar could establish his eligibility for\n\nasylum and a credible fear of harm on the basis of an imputed\n\n\n                                             -5-\n\fpolitical opinion.      Succar was placed into removal proceedings and\n\nwas subsequently paroled into the United States on November 30,\n\n1998.    Succar has remained in parole status.\n\n              Over one year later, on January 19, 2000, Succar admitted\n\nthe allegations in the Notice to Appear and conceded removability;\n\nhe renewed his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and\n\nprotection under the Convention Against Torture. On March 1, 2000,\n\na hearing was held on his asylum application and the trial was set\n\nfor April 18, 2000.      On April 18, after a hearing on the merits of\n\nhis application, the Immigration Judge (IJ) denied Succar's request\n\nfor asylum and withholding of removal.           Succar appealed this\n\ndecision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA).\n\n              On February 19, 2001, while his appeal was pending before\n\nthe BIA and while he was paroled into the United States, Succar\n\nmarried a United States citizen.       Succar's wife filed an immigrant\n\nvisa petition for him, and the petition was approved on April 26,\n\n2001.    The approval form directed Succar to contact the local INS\n\noffice to obtain Form I-485, the application for adjustment of\n\nstatus   to    a   permanent   resident.   Believing   that   he   met   the\n\nstatutory eligibility requirements for adjustment of status, on\n\nOctober 17, 2001, Succar filed a motion with the BIA to remand the\n\nproceedings to the IJ for consideration of his application for\n\nadjustment of status under 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a).          This motion was\n\n\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\funopposed by the INS.1           The BIA granted the motion on December 18,\n\n2001 and remanded the case to the IJ for further proceedings.                        The\n\nremand proved to be fruitless for the INS soon took the position\n\nthat under 8 C.F.R. § 245.1,2 Succar was ineligible to apply for\n\nadjustment    of        status    either      before    the    IJ   in    the   removal\n\nproceedings       or,    separately,       before      the    Immigration    Service’s\n\ndistrict director.\n\n             At    a    July     29,   2002    hearing,       Succar     submitted   his\n\nadjustment of status application to the IJ.                    In the middle of the\n\nhearing, the IJ stated that based on 8 C.F.R. § 245.1, \"I am\n\nconfident that I don't have the authority to adjust status to\n\nsomeone who's an arriving alien.\"                The IJ denied the adjustment of\n\nstatus application as a matter of law, and then continued, \"The\n\nImmigration Service doesn't have the authority to adjust his status\n\nunless they are willing to terminate this case with me and if that\n\nbe the case, I'll happily do it but I don't have the authority to\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      In March 2003, the relevant functions of the INS were\ntransferred to the Department of Homeland Security and reorganized\ninto the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. We refer\nto the immigration agency throughout as the INS. Mukamusoni v.\nAshcroft, 390 F.3d 110, 113 n.1 (1st Cir. 2004).\n     2\n      8 C.F.R. § 245.1(c)(8) is identical to 8 C.F.R. §\n1245.1(c)(8). Section 245.1(c)(8) applies to the immigration\nagencies in the Department of Homeland Security.            Section\n1245.1(c)(8) applies to the Executive Office for Immigration Review\nin the Department of Justice. This case concerns the validity of\n8 C.F.R. § 245.1(c)(8).\n\n                                           -7-\n\fterminate . . . .\"   In his oral decision of the same day, the IJ\n\nstated:\n\n          The respondent is an arriving alien and,\n          therefore, he is not eligible to adjust status\n          before the Immigration Judge.     Additionally\n          the respondent is not eligible to adjust\n          status before the District Director of the\n          Immigration Service in that he is in [removal]\n          proceedings. As I indicated to both counsel,\n          if the Immigration Service wished to have me\n          terminate these proceedings or even to\n          conditionally terminate them, I would have\n          done so in order to afford the Immigration\n          Service an opportunity to see whether an\n          adjustment of status ought to be granted.\n          However, that was not agreed to by the\n          Immigration Service counsel.\n\n          The regulations provide under 8 C.F.R. Section\n          245.1(c)(8) that any arriving alien who is in\n          removal   proceedings  pursuant   to   Section\n          235(b)(1) or Section 240 of the Act is\n          ineligible to adjust status.\n\nThe IJ also reaffirmed the previous order of removal to Lebanon.\n\n          The petitioner appealed both parts of the IJ's decision\n\nto the BIA, and on September 24, 2003, the BIA affirmed the IJ's\n\ndetermination in full.   On the adjustment of status issue, the BIA\n\nconcurred with the IJ that Succar was \"ineligible for adjustment of\n\n\n\n\n                                -8-\n\fstatus because he is an \"arriving alien.\"3            Succar timely appealed\n\nthe BIA’s decision to this court.\n\n                                       II.\n\n           We   set   the     issues   in    the   broader   context    of   the\n\nrequirements of immigration law.\n\nA.   Classes of Aliens\n\n           Before     1996,    non-citizens        were   divided   into     two\n\ncategories: (a) applicants for admission and (b) non-citizens\n\npresent in the United States who had previously made an entry into\n\nthe country either with, or without, an inspection.             An applicant\n\nfor admission, also called an arriving alien, was an individual\n\nseeking admission who had not yet entered the country.4                After an\n\ninspection, if an applicant was not admitted, he or she was subject\n\nto an exclusion proceeding to determine admissibility into the\n\nUnited   States.      The     second   category,     non-citizens      who   had\n\n\n     3\n       The BIA also affirmed Succar's order of removal. The Board\nagreed with the IJ \"that [Succar] has failed to meet his burden of\nproof in that he was not credible and did not provide detailed\ntestimony with which to conclude that he was or would be persecuted\nupon return to Lebanon.\" The BIA also rejected Succar's claim that\nthe translation during the evidentiary hearing was inadequate,\nfinding that there was \"no evidence to suggest that the respondent\nwas precluded from presenting testimony or that he was somehow\nprejudiced.\" Succar does not challenge the BIA's affirmance on the\nmerits of the order of removal in this court, but does challenge\nthe order of removal insofar as it precludes decision in the United\nStates of his adjustment of status application. The respondent\nmakes no argument that this somehow removes from the case the issue\nof the validity of the regulation, but defends on the merits.\n     4\n      An \"applicant for admission\" may be physically present in the\ncountry but not yet have \"entered\" for immigration purposes.\n\n                                       -9-\n\fpreviously made an entry, were treated as being present in the\n\nUnited States.     They were subject to deportation proceedings to\n\ndetermine whether they would be deported or admitted to stay.\n\n            In 1996, Congress passed IIRIRA.        See generally Reno v.\n\nAmerican-Arab    Anti-Discrimination      Comm.,   525   U.S.    471    (1999);\n\nGoncalves v. Reno, 144 F.3d 110 (1st Cir. 1998).          Among many other\n\nchanges, Congress eliminated the definition of the term \"entry\" and\n\nreplaced it with the terms \"admission\" and \"admitted.\" See IIRIRA,\n\nPub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-575 (1996).                 Admission and\n\nadmitted now include only \"the lawful entry of the alien into the\n\nUnited States after inspection and authorization by an immigration\n\nofficer.\"    8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(13)(A)(emphasis added).                The main\n\nimpact of this change is to re-characterize aliens who are present\n\nin the United States, but who have not been inspected and admitted.\n\nThey are now considered \"applicants for admission\" along with other\n\narriving aliens.       The statute requires that all aliens who are\n\nseeking admission or readmission to the United States be inspected\n\nby immigration officers, prior to a determination of their status.\n\nSee 8 U.S.C. § 1225(a)(3).\n\n            Congress    also   eliminated   deportation     and     exclusion\n\nproceedings and replaced them with removal proceedings, which were\n\napplicable to all aliens who were (1) in the United States without\n\nan inspection, (2) inspected and not admitted, or (3) previously\n\nadmitted but now subject to removal.        See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1225(b)(2),\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\f1227(a).     Special removal proceedings were established for two\n\ntypes of individuals arriving in the United States: those who are\n\n(1) suspected of being terrorists or a security threat, 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1225(c), or     (2)    stowaways,    8   U.S.C.     §    1225(a)(2).       Congress\n\nestablished expedited removal proceedings for arriving non-citizens\n\nwho are charged as inadmissible due to lack of proper documents or\n\nmaterial misrepresentations at entry.             See 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1).\n\nExpedited    removal    proceedings       provide       little   opportunity    for\n\nrelief; however, aliens in this situation can seek asylum.                    See 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A). If the alien alleges a credible fear based\n\non one of the statutory grounds, she receives an interview with an\n\nasylum pre-screening officer.            If the officer finds that she has\n\nalleged facts sufficient to justify a credible fear, then the alien\n\nwill be referred to an immigration judge.               8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(4);\n\n8 C.F.R. § 235.6(a)(1)(ii).\n\n            The last type of proceeding is the standard removal\n\nproceeding for persons present in the United States, regardless of\n\nwhether they are applicants for admission or have been living in\n\nthe United States previously.            8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(2); 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1229a.     Congress did not restrict the type of relief available to\n\nindividuals     in     removal      proceedings         under    section     1229a.\n\nSignificantly, the statute does not by its terms prevent this class\n\nof individuals from applying for adjustment of status.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fB.   Adjustment of Status\n\n            Adjustment of status is \"a technical term describing a\n\nprocess whereby certain aliens physically present in the United\n\nStates may obtain permanent resident status . . . without leaving\n\nthe United States.\"     3B Am. Jur. 2d Aliens & Citizens § 2134.\n\nBefore 1960, adjustment of status in the United States was only\n\navailable to non-citizens legally in the country.         See Immigration\n\nand Nationality Act, Pub. L. No. 414, 66 Stat. 217 (1952)(INA).\n\nAny immigrant present in the United States who was eligible for\n\nadjustment of status, but who was no longer in valid immigration\n\nstatus, had to obtain an immigrant visa at a United States post\n\nabroad in order to obtain permanent resident status.            See S. Rep.\n\nNo. 86-1651 (1960), reprinted in 1960 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3124, 3136.            To\n\nprocess   the   immigrant   visa   at   the   consular   post   abroad,   an\n\nimmigrant residing in the United States had to apply to the INS for\n\npreexamination and voluntary departure in order to insure that he\n\nwould be able to be readmitted into the country once he obtained\n\nthe immigrant visa.    See id.\n\n            In 1960, Congress established the current procedure for\n\nadjustment of status to obviate the need for departure and reentry\n\nfor aliens temporarily in the United States.         Congress explicitly\n\nexpanded the group of individuals eligible for adjustment of status\n\nto include all aliens who have been \"inspected and admitted or\n\nparoled.\"   See Joint Resolution of July 14, 1960, Pub. L. No. 86-\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\f648, 74 Stat. 505 (codified as amended at 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a)) (\"The\n\nstatus of an alien . . . who was inspected and admitted or paroled\n\ninto the United States may be adjusted by the Attorney General, in\n\nhis discretion and under such regulations as he may prescribe, to\n\nthat of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence . . .\n\n.\") (emphasis added).\n\n          \"Admitted aliens\" means individuals who have presented\n\nthemselves for inspection by an immigration officer and who have\n\nbeen allowed to enter the country.    See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(13)(A).\n\n\"Paroled aliens\" are otherwise inadmissible aliens who are given\n\npermission by the Attorney General to enter temporarily.    8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1182(d)(5)(A).   The statute governing parole states:\n\n          The Attorney General may, except as provided\n          in subparagraph (B) or in section 1184(f) of\n          this title, in his discretion parole into the\n          United   States    temporarily   under    such\n          conditions as he may prescribe only on a case-\n          by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons\n          or significant public benefit any alien\n          applying for admission to the United States .\n          . . .5\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A).\n\n\n\n     5\n      The exceptions to the parole authority of the Attorney\nGeneral do not apply to this case.          The limitation from\nsubparagraph B states that an alien who is a refugee cannot be\nparoled \"unless the Attorney General determines that compelling\nreasons in the public interest with respect to that particular\nalien require that the alien be paroled into the United States\nrather than be admitted as a refugee under section 1157 of the\ntitle.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(B). The other limitation deals with\naliens who are crewmen serving in good faith on board a vessel.\nSee 8 U.S.C. § 1184(f).\n\n                               -13-\n\f              In addition to being \"inspected and admitted or paroled,\"\n\naliens must be eligible to receive an immigrant visa and this visa\n\nmust be immediately available to them.         8 U.S.C. § 1255(a).      Aliens\n\nseeking an      immigrant   visa    must   first   receive   approval   of   an\n\nimmigrant petition, which is usually filed by an employer or a\n\nrelative.      The alien must then wait for and receive an immigrant\n\nvisa number, which means that a visa has been assigned.6            Dep’t of\n\nHomeland Sec., Citizenship & Immigration Servs., How do I get an\n\nImmigrant      Visa   Number,      at    http://uscis.gov/graphics/howdoi/\n\nimmvisa.htm (last modified October 31, 2003).\n\nC.   Parole\n\n            The purpose of parole is to permit a non-citizen to enter\n\nthe United States temporarily while investigation of eligibility\n\n\n\n     6\n      There are three types of immigrant visas available:       (1)\nfamily-sponsored immigrant visas, (2) employment-based immigrant\nvisas, and (3) diversity immigrant visas. 8 U.S.C. §§ 1151(a)(1),\n(2), (3).    For immediate relatives of United States citizens,\nincluding spouses, parents, and unmarried children under the age of\n21, an immigrant visa number is automatically available upon\napproval of the visa petition. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., Citizenship\n& Immigration Servs., How do I get an Immigrant Visa Number?, at\nhttp://uscis.gov/graphics/howdoi/immvisa.htm (last modified October\n31, 2003). All other individuals seeking visas based on familial\nrelationships and individuals seeking to receive visas based on\nemployment must wait for a visa number.        These numbers come\navailable in order of preference for different types of\nrelationships and employment. 8 U.S.C. §§ 1153(a), (b)(1). As for\nrelationships, first priority is given to unmarried sons and\ndaughters of United States citizens over the age of 21. 8 U.S.C.\n§ 1153(a). In the employment context, first priority is given to\nworkers with extraordinary abilities, professors and researchers,\nand certain multinational executives and managers. 8 U.S.C. §\n1153(b).\n\n                                        -14-\n\ffor admission takes place.7     Congress has ordered certain aliens\n\nremoved; they are not eligible for parole.       8 U.S.C. § 1225(c)(1).\n\nCongress has set forth the conditions for parole in the statute.\n\nSee 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A).        Congress authorizes the Attorney\n\nGeneral to allow parole \"temporarily under such conditions as he\n\nmay prescribe only on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian\n\nreasons or significant public benefit.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A).\n\nAccordingly, the Attorney General has promulgated regulations.         8\n\nC.F.R. § 212.5.      Under the regulations, aliens in one of five\n\ngroups   can   be   paroled   for    urgent   humanitarian   reasons   or\n\nsignificant public benefit \"provided the aliens present neither a\n\nsecurity risk nor a risk of absconding.\"          8 C.F.R. § 212.5(b).\n\nThese five groups are: (1) aliens with a serious medical condition,\n\n\n\n     7\n      There are several types of parole.      In 2003, 70% of all\nparolees were paroled under the most common type of parole, port of\nentry parole.     Dep't of Homeland Sec., Office of Immigration\nStatistics, 2003 Yearbook of Immigration Statistics 83. Port of\nentry parolees are \"authorized at the port upon alien's arrival;\n[port of entry parole] applies to a wide variety of situations and\nis used at the discretion of the supervisory immigration inspector,\nusually to allow short periods of entry.\"      Id. at 190. Advance\nparole is a second type of parole; it is issued to an alien\nresiding in the United States who has an unexpected need to travel\nabroad and whose conditions of stay do not otherwise allow for\nreadmission to the United States. Id. Deferred inspection parole\nis conferred by an immigration inspector when aliens appear with\ndocumentation, but after preliminary examination some questions\nremain about their admissibility. Id. The three other types of\nparole are humanitarian parole, granted in instances of medical\nemergency; public interest parole, granted for aliens participating\nin legal proceedings; and overseas parole, which is granted,\nusually by special statute, to individuals while they are in their\nhome country to allow them to enter the United States.\n\n                                    -15-\n\f(2) women who have been medically certified as pregnant, (3) aliens\n\nwho are defined as juveniles in certain circumstances, (4) aliens\n\nwho will be witnesses in judicial proceedings, and (5) aliens whose\n\ncontinued detention is not in the public interest as determined by\n\nthe officials charged with exercising this discretion.   8 C.F.R. §\n\n212.5(b)(1)-(5).   In making their decisions, immigration officers\n\ncan consider whether the alien has \"[c]ommunity ties\" such as close\n\nrelatives with known addresses.   8 C.F.R. § 212.5(d)(2).   Arriving\n\naliens who claim asylum and establish a credible fear with an\n\nasylum pre-screening officer can be paroled at the point of entry\n\nwhile they pursue their asylum application.8\n\n          A paroled individual is not considered \"admitted\" into\n\nthe United States: he is an \"applicant for admission.\"   8 U.S.C. §\n\n1101(13)(B).   He is not detained and is allowed to temporarily\n\nenter the United States.     However, \"when the purposes of such\n\nparole . . . have been served the alien shall forthwith return or\n\nbe returned to the custody from which he was paroled and thereafter\n\nhis case shall continue to be dealt with in the same manner as that\n\nof any other applicant for admission to the United States.\"        8\n\n\n\n     8\n      A report to Congress governing the use of the Attorney\nGeneral's parole authority indicates that aliens establishing a\ncredible fear of persecution can be and often are paroled into the\nUnited States while they seek asylum. Immigration & Naturalization\nServ., Report to Congress: Use of the Attorney General’s Parole\nAuthority Under the Immigration & Nationality Act: Fiscal Years\n1998-1999,            8     (2003),         available          at\nhttp://uscis.gov/graphics/repsstudies/parolerpt9899.pdf.\n\n                               -16-\n\fU.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A).            It appears from the face of the statute\n\nthat the Attorney General has no discretion in this determination.\n\nAs soon as the reasons for parole have been served, the individual\n\nmust be returned to custody.\n\n           By      statute,    paroled     individuals9   are    eligible      for\n\nadjustment of status if they meet the other statutory eligibility\n\nrequirements.        8   U.S.C.     §   1255(a).     Section    1255   makes    no\n\ndistinction between those who are in removal proceedings and those\n\nwho are not for purposes of adjustment of status.\n\n            Since the 1960 enactment of section 1255(a), Congress has\n\non several occasions amended other provisions of 8 U.S.C. § 1255 to\n\nrestrict the class of people who are eligible to receive adjustment\n\nof status.      For example, alien crewmen, aliens continuing or\n\naccepting unauthorized employment, and aliens admitted in transit\n\nwithout a visa are not eligible to adjust status under section\n\n1255(a), unless they fall into limited exceptions to the bar on\n\neligibility.       8 U.S.C. § 1255(c).             Congress also limited the\n\nability of an alien to adjust status if the alien is married in the\n\nUnited    States    while     in    judicial   proceedings.       8    U.S.C.    §\n\n1255(e)(1).10   Significantly, Congress has never taken parolees, as\n\n\n     9\n      Succar's application was made during the removal proceedings\nand the respondent makes no argument that Succar's parole was\nrevoked.\n     10\n      The respondent does not argue that Succar is ineligible to\nadjust status on the ground that he entered into his marriage while\nhis removal proceedings were pending. Regardless, it appears from\n\n                                        -17-\n\fa group, out of the class of eligible aliens, despite over a dozen\n\nopportunities--where section 1255 was otherwise amended--to do so.\n\n            Parolees, although they are physically present in the\n\nUnited States, are treated as if they were at the border seeking\n\nadmission. Before the 1996 IIRIRA statutory changes, parolees were\n\nsubject to exclusion proceedings. Post-IIRIRA, individuals who are\n\nparoled and are seeking asylum are subject to removal proceedings.\n\nAs arriving aliens, parolees are subject to removal proceedings.\n\n\"[I]f the examining officer determines that an alien seeking\n\nadmission   is   not   clearly   and   beyond   a   doubt   entitled   to   be\n\nadmitted, the alien shall be detained for a [removal] proceeding .\n\n. . .\"   8 U.S.C. § 1225 (b)(2)(A).         Parolees are generally not\n\n\"clearly and beyond a doubt\" entitled to admission.             However, as\n\nparolees, they are not in detention.            Until the final order of\n\nremoval, which in some circumstances–-such as where the applicant\n\nis applying for asylum--can take years, paroled aliens in removal\n\nproceedings, such as Succar, live, work and form relationships\n\nwithin the United States.\n\n\n\n\nthe record that Succar fits within the exception to this\nprohibition, 8 U.S.C § 1255(e)(3), as he was granted approval of\nthe I-130 petition, filed by Succar's wife on his behalf, and the\nrequest for a bona fide marriage exemption.\n     The respondent's only argument as to why Succar is ineligible\nto adjust status is the Attorney General's regulation denying\nadjustment of status to arriving aliens (including parolees) in\nremoval proceedings.\n\n                                   -18-\n\fD.    Parolees and Adjustment of Status\n\n            Before    the    promulgation     of    8    C.F.R.    §    245.1(c)(8),\n\nparoled aliens in exclusion proceedings had an independent avenue\n\nto apply for adjustment of status.11              In re Castro-Padron, 21 I. &\n\nN. Dec. 379, 379-80 (BIA 1996).             The BIA held that in exclusion\n\nproceedings,      jurisdiction      over     an     alien's       application     for\n\nadjustment   of     status    lay   with    the    district      director    of   the\n\nimmigration agency, not the IJ.            Id. at 379.     The Board explained,\n\n\"[A]pplicants [in exclusion proceedings] can file their adjustment\n\napplication with the district director of the [INS], who has sole\n\njurisdiction over the application and can act on the application\n\nindependently of these [exclusion] proceedings.\"                   Id. at 380.\n\n            Historically, the district director had jurisdiction over\n\nthe    adjustment    application      of     both       aliens     in    deportation\n\nproceedings who were admitted and aliens in exclusion proceedings\n\nwho were paroled.12         In re Mannah, 16 I. & N. Dec. 272, 274 (BIA\n\n\n      11\n      Upon a clarification request from this court on the law prior\nto the passage of the regulation in question, the Attorney General\njoined in a letter with the petitioner which explained that prior\nto 1997, arriving aliens in exclusion proceedings who were\nstatutorily eligible for adjustment of status could apply to the\ndistrict director for this relief.\n       12\n       The pre-1997 regulations allowed one subcategory of parolees,\nadvanced parolees, to bring an initial application for adjustment\nof status before the IJ and to renew before an IJ applications for\nadjustment of status previously denied by the district director.\nIn re Castro-Padron, 21 I. & N. Dec. 379, 380 (BIA 1996). Advanced\nparolees were aliens who had been granted advance parole before\nleaving the United States. They then left, returned, and were now\nin exclusion proceedings. They were treated the same as admitted\n\n                                      -19-\n\f1977).    In    1961,    regulations   gave    the   IJ   the   authority    in\n\ndeportation cases to renew admitted aliens' adjustment applications\n\nthat were denied by the district director and to adjudicate initial\n\napplications for such aliens in deportation proceedings. Id. With\n\nthis change, the district director no longer had authority over\n\nadjustment applications once deportation proceedings began.                 Id.\n\nHowever, the Board determined that this enlarged jurisdiction did\n\nnot apply when the alien was in exclusion proceedings:                      the\n\ndistrict director retained sole authority for adjustment of status\n\napplications.     Id.\n\n          In     1997,    the   Attorney      General13    promulgated      new\n\nregulations, which were said to implement IIRIRA.           The regulations\n\ncreated a new definition for the term arriving alien:\n\n          The term arriving alien means an applicant for\n          admission coming or attempting to come into\n          the United States at a port of entry, or an\n          alien seeking transit through the United\n          States at a port-of-entry, or an alien\n          interdicted in international or United States\n          waters and brought into the United States by\n          any means, whether or not to a designated\n          port-of-entry, and regardless of the means of\n          transport.   An arriving alien remains such\n\n\naliens in deportation proceedings, meaning that they could apply to\nthe IJ for adjustment of status.        The Board held that this\nregulation did not apply to other paroled aliens who were arriving\nfor the first time and were placed in exclusion proceedings -- they\ncontinued to be limited to pursuing their adjustment applications\nbefore the district director only. Id.\n     13\n      The Attorney General at the time of the promulgation of this\nregulation was Janet Reno.     Successor Attorney General, John\nAshcroft, chose to defend this regulation.\n\n                                   -20-\n\f            even if paroled pursuant to section 212 (d)(5)\n            of the Act . . . .\n\n8 C.F.R. § 1.1(q).\n\n            Armed with this new definition of arriving alien, the\n\nAttorney General made a substantive change to the adjustment of\n\nstatus regulations.        The Attorney General made several categories\n\nof aliens ineligible to apply for adjustment of status under 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1255(a), including \"[a]ny arriving alien who is in removal\n\nproceedings pursuant to section 235(b)(1) or section 240 of the\n\nAct.\"   8     C.F.R.   §   245.1(c)(8)   (emphasis   added).   It   is   this\n\nparticular provision of the regulation that is challenged before\n\nthis court.\n\n            The Attorney General also enacted regulations regarding\n\nthe proper place for an eligible individual to file for adjustment\n\nof status.    A key regulation states:\n\n            An alien [who believes he or she is eligible\n            for adjustment of status] shall apply to the\n            director having jurisdiction over his or her\n            place of residence . . . . After an alien,\n            other   than   an  arriving   alien,   is   in\n            deportation or removal proceedings, his or her\n            application for adjustment of status . . .\n            shall be made and considered only in those\n            proceedings. . . . An arriving alien, other\n            than an alien in removal proceedings, who\n            believes he or she meets the eligibility\n            requirements . . . , shall apply to the\n            director having jurisdiction over his or her\n            place of arrival.\n\n8 C.F.R. § 245.2(a)(1) (emphasis added).             A parolee in removal\n\nproceedings thus no longer has the ability to apply before anyone,\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\feither the district director or the IJ, for adjustment of status.\n\nBy contrast, a parolee who is not in removal proceedings (as an\n\narriving alien) can, consistent with earlier practice, apply to the\n\ndistrict director for adjustment of status.   We are informed that\n\nmost arriving alien parolees are placed in removal proceedings.\n\nThe new regulatory scheme is, thus, a break from earlier practice.\n\n           In promulgating 8 C.F.R. § 245.1(c)(8) in 1997, the\n\nAttorney General explained the rationale for the new regulation:\n\n           Consistent with Congress' intent that arriving\n           aliens . . . be removed in an expedited manner\n           through the procedures provided . . . , the\n           Attorney General has determined that she will\n           not favorably exercise her discretion to\n           adjust the status of arriving aliens who are\n           ordered removed . . . .\n\n62 Fed. Reg. 444, 452 (January 3, 1997).   In an effort to quickly\n\nremove aliens, the regulation aimed to eliminate avenues available\n\nto arriving aliens in removal proceedings that allow such aliens to\n\n\"delay their removal through an application for adjustment of\n\nstatus.\"   Id.    The Attorney General explained that an arriving\n\nalien will not be able to adjust status within the United States.\n\nIf an arriving alien is eligible for an immigrant visa, she will be\n\n\"required to return to . . . her country of residence and request\n\nit through the consular process available to all aliens outside of\n\nthe United States.\"   Id.   The Attorney General believed that if\n\n\"the Service decides as a matter of prosecutorial discretion, not\n\nto initiate removal proceedings but to parole the arriving alien,\n\n\n                               -22-\n\fthe alien will be able to apply for adjustment of status before the\n\ndistrict director.\"     Id.\n\n            Under the new regulations, arriving aliens in removal\n\nproceedings     (regardless    of    whether       they   otherwise    meet   the\n\nstatutory criteria for adjustment of status) must leave the United\n\nStates and go through consular processing in order to adjust\n\nstatus; the respondent has represented that this is the only option\n\navailable to them.     But there are significant limitations even as\n\nto   this   avenue.     Non-citizens         are    subject   to   8   U.S.C.   §\n\n1182(a)(9)(B)(i), which bars non-citizens from reentry into the\n\nUnited States for three years if they were unlawfully present in\n\nthe United States for more than 180 days but less than one year and\n\nfor ten years if they were unlawfully present for more than one\n\nyear.14     Any waiver of this statutory bar is in the absolute\n\ndiscretion of the Attorney General.            8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(B)(v).\n\nAlso, non-citizens who have not been admitted into the United\n\nStates    are   ineligible    for   voluntary      departure.      8   U.S.C.   §\n\n1229c(a)(4).      Following any involuntary removal, they will be\n\nineligible for readmission for five years unless the Attorney\n\nGeneral grants a waiver.            8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(A)(i), (iii).\n\nParolees have, by definition, not been admitted, and thus will\n\ngenerally be subject to this five year bar for involuntary removal\n\n\n     14\n      Succar asserts that he would be barred from reentry into the\nUnited States for ten years, and the government does not contend\notherwise.\n\n                                      -23-\n\fas well. Denying paroled aliens in removal proceedings the ability\n\nto   adjust    status    within    the    United   States   thus       creates      a\n\nsignificant hardship on these individuals and their families.\n\n           Of course, as the Attorney General has stated, the\n\nimmigration agency in theory can decide to terminate the removal\n\nproceedings in the alien's favor, which would allow the arriving\n\nalien–-who would then not be in removal proceedings–-to apply for\n\nadjustment of status before the district director.               The government\n\nas prosecutor in the removal proceedings may, in its discretion,\n\nterminate the proceedings in order to permit the alien to apply for\n\nadjustment of status.         But as this case demonstrates, the BIA has\n\napparently taken the position that neither it nor the IJ may\n\nsuspend or terminate the proceedings for this purpose without the\n\ngovernment's consent.\n\n                                     III.\n\nAvailability of Judicial Review of Statutory Interpretation Claim\n\n           The    Attorney     General    first    argues   that       8    U.S.C   §\n\n1252(a)(2)(B) precludes judicial review of the Attorney General's\n\ndenial of Succar's application for adjustment of status because the\n\nAttorney      General,   through    the    promulgation     of     8       C.F.R.    §\n\n245.1(c)(8),     made    a   discretionary   determination       that       arriving\n\naliens do not merit adjustment of status under 8 U.S.C. § 1255.                     We\n\ndisagree and exercise review.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -24-\n\f            Section 1252 provides for judicial review of orders of\n\nremoval, and sets forth limitations on this review.    The Attorney\n\nGeneral relies on §1252(a)(2)(B), which reads in part as follows:\n\n                   (B) Denials of discretionary relief\n                   Notwithstanding any other provision of\n            law, no court shall have jurisdiction to\n            review--\n                   (i) any judgment regarding the granting\n            of relief under section . . . 1255 of this\n            title\n\n8 U.S.C § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i).   Both the Supreme Court and this court\n\nhave consistently rejected arguments that Congress has eliminated\n\njudicial review of the legal question of interpretation of the\n\nstatute as to whether an alien is eligible for consideration of\n\nrelief.15\n\n            Succar challenges the Attorney General's regulation as\n\nbeing contrary to the statute; that is a classic issue for the\n\ncourt to decide.    The issue presented is a purely legal question\n\nand as such is not within the jurisdictional bar of 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1252(a)(2)(B).    That is the ruling of Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S.\n\n678, 688 (2001), which exercised judicial review over a challenge\n\nto the extent of the Attorney General's authority to detain an\n\n\n\n     15\n      A decision by the Attorney General on the merits of the\napplication for adjustment of status under 8 U.S.C. § 1255 is\ncommitted to the discretion of the Attorney General. If the BIA\nhad adjudicated and denied Succar's application on the merits, and\nSuccar challenged this decision, then, arguably, this court would\nnot have jurisdiction to review that discretionary determination.\nThis is not what is at issue here; rather the issue is one of\nstatutory interpretation. The two questions are distinct.\n\n                                -25-\n\falien indefinitely under the post-removal-period detention statute\n\nbecause the authority of the Attorney General to act is \"not a\n\nmatter of discretion\" and is subject to judicial review.           So here\n\nthe challenge goes to the Attorney General’s statutory authority\n\nand not his discretion.      See Subhan v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 591, 594\n\n(7th    Cir.    2004)   (interpreting   8   U.S.C.   §   1252(a)(2)(B)   as\n\npreserving jurisdiction when the decision is not \"a judgment\n\ndenying a request for adjustment of status\" under 8 U.S.C. § 1255);\n\nsee also Montero-Martinez v. Ashcroft, 277 F.3d 1137, 1141 (9th\n\nCir. 2002) (Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) does not preclude review of\n\n\"purely legal and hence non-discretionary\" questions.); Prado v.\n\nReno, 198 F.3d 286, 288 (1st Cir. 1999) (Whether a court can\n\nexercise review depends on the grounds upon which the decision of\n\nthe BIA rests and \"the precise nature of the claims made in the\n\npetition.\").\n\n               Quite literally, the Attorney General did not, under 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i), make \"a judgment regarding the granting\n\nof relief under section 1255,\" because the effect of the regulation\n\nis to preclude an alien from even applying for relief under section\n\n1255.    See Subhan, 383 F.3d at 594 (exercising jurisdiction over\n\nthe IJ's decision even though the effect of the decision is the\n\nsame as that of a denial of an adjustment of status application;\n\nthe court has jurisdiction because \"the purpose behind [8 U.S.C. §\n\n1252(a)(2)(B)(i)] is presumably to shield from judicial review\n\n\n                                   -26-\n\fjudgments regarding the propriety of adjusting an alien's status,\n\nand no such judgment has ever been made with regard to the\n\n[petitioner]\").\n\n              This court has jurisdiction to review Succar's claim\n\nunder 28      U.S.C.    §   1331,    which      grants   courts    general   federal\n\nquestion jurisdiction, Reno v. Catholic Soc. Servs., Inc., 509 U.S.\n\n43, 56 (1993), and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which\n\ngives a court power to \"'hold unlawful and set aside' not only\n\nagency action that is 'arbitrary' or 'capricious,' but also agency\n\naction that is 'otherwise not in accordance with law' or is 'in\n\nexcess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or\n\nshort of statutory right.'\"             Cousins v. Sec’y of the United States\n\nDep’t of Transp., 880 F.2d 603, 608 (1st Cir. 1989) (quoting 5\n\nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A, C)).             \"It is 'central to the real meaning of\n\n\"the rule of law,\" [and] not particularly controversial' that a\n\nfederal agency does not have the power to act unless Congress, by\n\nstatute, has empowered it to do so.\"               Transohio Sav.

When an agency action is contrary to the scope of a\n\nstatutory delegation of authority or is an arbitrary and capricious\n\nexercise of that authority, that action must be invalidated by\n\nreviewing courts.\n\n\n                                         -27-\n\f                                  IV.\n\nA.   Merits:    Validity of Regulation Vis-à-Vis the Statute\n\n            The question presented is whether the regulation, 8\n\nC.F.R. § 245.1(c)(8), is invalid as clearly contrary to 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1255(a) or as an arbitrary or capricious exercise of the Attorney\n\nGeneral's      delegated authority.     The regulation affects certain\n\narriving aliens who have been granted parole into the United States\n\nand have also been placed in removal proceedings.         As explained\n\nabove, before adoption of 8 C.F.R. § 245.1(c)(8) in 1997, this\n\ncategory of aliens, if they met the other statutory requirements,\n\ncould apply for adjustment of status with the local district\n\ndirector.      The effect of    8 C.F.R. § 245.1(c)(8) is to deny\n\neligibility for relief under 8 U.S.C. § 1255 to this category of\n\naliens by precluding consideration of their applications either\n\nbefore the district director or before an IJ.\n\n            Succar and supporting amici16 launch a three-fold attack\n\non the regulation.      First, they argue the regulation is flatly\n\ninconsistent with congressional intent as expressed in 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1255(a) and the legislative history.         Alternatively, they argue\n\nthere are two possible interpretations of the regulation which must\n\nbe adopted to avoid a conflict between the regulation and the\n\nstatute.    Finally, they argue that the Attorney General has acted\n\n\n     16\n      Both the American Immigration Law Foundation and the\nMassachusetts Law Reform Institute have participated as amici and\nwe acknowledge their able assistance.\n\n                                 -28-\n\fultra vires.      Succar argues that 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a) expressly\n\nmentions persons in parole status (without restricting that status\n\nto those not in removal proceedings) as among those eligible to\n\napply for adjustment of status, and therefore Congress intends for\n\nany decision made within the Attorney General's admitted discretion\n\nto be made on an individualized basis after an eligible alien\n\napplies, not as a categorical eligibility exclusion.17\n\n          The Attorney General defends the regulation, arguing that\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1255(a) expressly states that the decision to grant\n\nadjustment   of   status    is   subject   to   the   Attorney   General's\n\ndiscretion and that the regulation is no more than a valid exercise\n\nof that discretion.        The Attorney General points out that the\n\nregulation does not make all of those in parole status ineligible\n\nto apply for adjustment of status, only those who have been placed\n\nin removal proceedings.     However, it was represented in the briefs\n\n\n     17\n      The majority of petitioner's efforts to attack the statute\nare unpersuasive.    We explain briefly the futility of these\nattacks. The Attorney General was expressly given discretion by\nthe statute and has authority to promulgate regulations, so that\ncannot be the basis of an ultra vires attack.\n     If a regulation is unreasonable in light of the statute as\neither arbitrary and capricious or as flatly inconsistent with the\nclear meaning of the statute as expressed by Congress, the\nregulation will violate the Chevron doctrine, and calling the\nregulation ultra vires in those circumstances adds nothing to the\nanalysis.   See Chevron USA, Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council,\nInc., 467 U.S. 837, 842 (1984).\n     Further, while the doctrine of constitutional avoidance\npermits a court in some instances to adopt a particular\nconstruction of a law to avoid issues of unconstitutionality, that\ndoctrine is unavailable here. The claims of petitioner are based\nnot in the Constitution but in a statute.\n\n                                   -29-\n\fbefore this court that the \"majority of the intended beneficiaries\n\nof parolee adjustment of status are in removal proceedings.\"                    The\n\nAttorney General does not dispute this statement.\n\n              Paroled individuals must be placed in removal proceedings\n\n\"if the examining immigration officer determines that an alien\n\nseeking admission is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be\n\nadmitted.\"     8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(2)(A).      The Attorney General argues\n\nthat    the   challenged   regulation   does       not    effectuate     a    final\n\nexclusion from eligibility because even though these individuals\n\ncannot apply while they are physically in the United States, the\n\nalien can leave the United States and then apply for an immigrant\n\nvisa at the embassy or consular office in his home country.\n\n              The   petitioner   responds   that    the    result   of       such   a\n\nrequirement, contrary to congressional intent, is that many aliens\n\nwould be barred from even applying from outside the country for\n\nlong periods of time because of the statutory bars discussed above.\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9).18         As we shall see, in enacting section\n\n1255(a) in 1960, Congress expressed an intent that eligible aliens\n\nbe able to adjust status without having to leave the United States,\n\nto relieve the burden on the United States citizen with whom the\n\n\n\n       18\n      Others, the petitioner argues, will not be able to return to\ntheir home countries because they fled, fearing persecution there,\nthe basis for their asylum application. The logical response is\nthat if those aliens prove they are eligible for asylum or\nwithholding of removal, they may, in the discretion of the agency,\nnot be removed. They may then apply for adjustment of status.\n\n                                    -30-\n\faliens had the requisite family or other relationship, on the\n\nUnited States consulates abroad, and on the alien.         That was one of\n\nthe primary purposes of the legislation.\n\n           The Attorney General also argues that the passage of\n\nIIRIRA, Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (1996), altered the\n\nimmigration laws in many restrictive ways.          Petitioner counters\n\nthat IIRIRA did indeed tighten restrictions, but points out that\n\napplication for adjustment of status by parolees was one of the few\n\nareas untouched.      This, the petitioner says, reflected Congress's\n\nconsistent understanding that the immigration agency would consider\n\napplications for adjustment of status from parolees, whether in\n\nremoval proceedings or not.\n\nB. Standard of Review\n\n           Two points are undisputed: Congress has granted the\n\nAttorney General some degree of discretion to adjust the status of\n\nstatutorily specified aliens in 8 U.S.C. § 1255 and Congress has\n\ngranted the Attorney General authority to promulgate regulations\n\nwhich   guide   the   exercise   of   this   discretion.     8   U.S.C.   §\n\n1103(g)(2).      When there is no challenge to whether Congress\n\nauthorized the Attorney General to issue regulations, we are faced\n\nwith only two questions.\n\n           We first ask whether \"Congress has directly spoken to the\n\nprecise question at issue.\" Chevron USA, Inc. v. Natural Res. Def.\n\nCouncil, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842 (1984).       If so, courts, as well as\n\n\n                                  -31-\n\fthe agency, \"must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent\n\nof Congress.\"   Id. at 842-43.   As the Supreme Court has said in the\n\nimmigration context:\n\n          The judiciary is the final authority on issues\n          of statutory construction and must reject\n          administrative    constructions    which   are\n          contrary to clear congressional intent. If a\n          court,   employing    traditional   tools   of\n          statutory   construction,    ascertains   that\n          Congress had an intention on the precise\n          question at issue, that intention is the law\n          and must be given effect.\n\nINS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. at 447-48 (quoting Chevron USA\n\nInc., 467 U.S. at 843 n.9) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n\"Chevron[] deference to [an agency's] statutory interpretation is\n\ncalled for only when the devices of judicial construction have been\n\ntried and found to yield no clear sense of congressional intent.\"\n\nGen. Dynamics Land Sys., Inc. v. Cline, 124 S. Ct. 1236, 1248\n\n(2004).\n\n          In determining whether a statute exhibits Chevron-type\n\nambiguity, and hence warrants deference to the Attorney General’s\n\ninterpretation of the statute, courts look at both the most natural\n\nreading of the language and the consistency of the \"interpretive\n\nclues\" Congress provided.    Gen. Dynamics Land Sys., Inc., 124 S.\n\nCt. at 1240, 1248.     In determining the meaning of a statute, our\n\nanalysis begins with the language of the statute.      See Leocal v.\n\nAshcroft, 125 S.Ct. 377, 382 (2004) (reversing INS interpretation\n\nof term \"crime of violence\" in 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) and 8\n\n\n                                 -32-\n\fU.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(f)).     \"[W]e construe language in its context\n\nand in light of the terms surrounding it.\"      Id.   Another \"regular\n\ninterpretive method\" is reference to statutory history to see if\n\nany \"serious question . . . even about purely textual ambiguity\" is\n\nleft.     Gen. Dynamics Land Sys., Inc., 124 S. Ct. at 1248.\n\n            However, whenever Congress has left a gap for the agency\n\nto fill, then we reach the second question, for the agency's\n\nregulation is \"given controlling weight unless [it is] arbitrary,\n\ncapricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.\"      Chevron USA,\n\nInc., 467 U.S. at 843-44; see Household Credit Servs., Inc. v.\n\nPfennig, 124 S. Ct. 1741, 1746-47 (2004).\n\n            If the statutory terms are ambiguous, then the principle\n\nof Chevron deference to the Attorney General's choice must apply.\n\nCardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. at 448.       Indeed, the Supreme Court has\n\nsaid that \"judicial deference to the Executive Branch is especially\n\nappropriate in the immigration context where officials 'exercise\n\nespecially sensitive political functions that implicate questions\n\nof foreign relations.'\" INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U.S. 415, 425\n\n(1999) (quoting INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 110 (1988)).19         That\n\n\n     19\n       The regulations guiding the Attorney General's parole\ndecisions do not allow for the parole of aliens thought to be a\nsecurity risk.   8 C.F.R. § 212.5(b).     Further, if the arriving\nalien is thought to be inadmissible because (1) he has engaged in\nor is suspected of being a terrorist, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(3)(B), (2)\nhe seeks to enter into the country to engage in actions against the\nUnited States government, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(3)(A), or (3) his\nentry or proposed actions in the United States would have\npotentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the\n\n                                 -33-\n\fsaid, the court has not hesitated to reject an INS interpretation\n\nas contrary to congressional intent. See, e.g., Leocal, 125 S. Ct.\n\nat 382; Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. at 448-49.\n\nC.    Statutory Ambiguity\n\n            Each    party   initially       argues      that   the    statute   is\n\nunambiguous, in its favor.       The Attorney General argues that the\n\nstatute unambiguously grants him discretion to allow or deny\n\nadjustment of status to an alien.                 One way to exercise that\n\ndiscretion,   the    Attorney   General      argues,      is   to    make   certain\n\ncategories of otherwise eligible aliens ineligible to apply and so\n\nineligible to warrant the favorable exercise of the Attorney\n\nGeneral’s discretion.       In the Attorney General's view, this is the\n\nend of the matter.\n\n            We agree that the statute gives the Attorney General\n\ndiscretion, but disagree that this ends the analysis as to whether\n\nthe Attorney General can promulgate this particular categorical\n\neligibility exclusion. The Supreme Court itself has ruled that the\n\ntwo   questions     of   discretion    as    to   the    ultimate     relief    and\n\ndiscretion as to eligibility exclusions are distinct. See Cardoza-\n\nFonseca, 480 U.S. at 443-44 (distinguishing between the discretion\n\nin the Attorney General as to the ultimate decision to grant relief\n\n\n\nUnited States, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(3)(C), the alien shall be ordered\nremoved, and the order of removal shall be reported to the Attorney\nGeneral. 8 U.S.C. § 1225(c). The order of removal is subject to\nlimited review procedures. 8 U.S.C. § 1225(c)(2).\n\n                                      -34-\n\fand   the    underlying    process   and    criteria    for   eligibility   for\n\nrelief); see also Goncalves, 144 F.3d at 125 (\"Analytically, the\n\ndecision whether an alien is eligible to be considered for a\n\nparticular discretionary form of relief is a statutory question\n\nseparate from the discretionary component of the administrative\n\ndecision whether to grant relief.\").\n\n             The statute, we find, is unambiguous on this issue and\n\nthat congressional clarity works against the Attorney General.                We\n\nreject the respondent's argument that Congress authorized 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 245.1(c)(8), making parolees in removal proceedings ineligible to\n\nadjust status, either by \"express delegation or the introduction of\n\nan interpretive gap.\"        Pauley v. BethEnergy Mines, Inc., 501 U.S.\n\n680, 696 (1991).          Congress has spoken clearly on the issue of\n\neligibility for adjustment of status and has reserved for itself\n\nthe determination of whether a non-citizen should be able to apply\n\nfor   this    relief.      The   Attorney    General    cannot   promulgate    a\n\nregulation     that     categorically      excludes    from   application   for\n\nadjustment of status a category of otherwise eligible aliens; this\n\nis contrary to congressional intent in section 1255.\n\n1.    Text of the Statute\n\nWe look first to 8 U.S.C. § 1255 itself, which provides:\n\n             § 1255.

By statute, two\n\ncategories of aliens are eligible to apply.           First is an alien who\n\nwas inspected and admitted.       Second is an alien who was paroled.\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1255(a).    The Attorney General's regulation carves out\n\nan exception from this second category of eligible aliens, by\n\nmaking   paroled   aliens   who   are   placed   in   removal   proceedings\n\nineligible for adjustment of status relief, even if they otherwise\n\nmeet the statutory requirements.        8 C.F.R. § 245.1(c)(8).\n\n           Congress    unambiguously       reserved      to     itself   the\n\ndetermination of who is eligible to apply for adjustment of status\n\n\n\n                                   -36-\n\frelief.        8 C.F.R. § 245.1(c)(8) conflicts with the statute in\n\nseveral ways.\n\n               First, Congress itself explicitly determined categories\n\nof aliens (those aliens who had been \"inspected and admitted or\n\nparoled\") who        are    eligible   for   adjustment   of   status      if   they\n\notherwise meet the statutory requirements.                8 U.S.C. § 1255(a).\n\nDespite numerous amendments to 8 U.S.C. § 1255 since 1960, Congress\n\nhas not limited the eligibility of paroled aliens under section\n\n1255(a).20 The statute has never stated that an alien is ineligible\n\nto adjust status if he is in removal proceedings.\n\n               Second, when Congress desired to limit the ability of a\n\nnon-citizen who might otherwise have been eligible to apply for\n\nadjustment of status under 1255(a), it has done so explicitly by\n\ndefining several categories of aliens as not eligible to apply.\n\nFor    example,      alien    crewmen,    aliens   continuing    or       accepting\n\nunauthorized employment, and aliens admitted in transit without a\n\nvisa are not eligible to adjust status under section 1255(a) unless\n\nthey        fall   into    limited   exceptions.      8    U.S.C.     §     1255(c)\n\n(\"[S]ubsection (a) [of 8 U.S.C. § 1255] shall not be applicable to\n\n\n\n       20\n      Since   1960,   Congress   has  amended   section   1255(a),\nspecifically, two times. Historical & Statutory Notes, 8 U.S.C.A.\n§ 1255.    These two amendments do not have any effect on the\neligibility of paroled individuals to adjust status and are not at\nissue in this case. Both of these amendments to section 1255(a)\nexpanded the category of aliens eligible for adjustment of status\nand in no way limited the eligibility of a paroled alien to adjust\nstatus.\n\n                                         -37-\n\f. . . .\")(emphasis added).                  Another category of aliens that\n\nCongress has explicitly determined is ineligible to apply for\n\nrelief under section 1255(a) is the alien who is seeking to obtain\n\nan immigrant visa based on a marriage entered into while judicial\n\nproceedings are pending regarding the alien's right to be admitted\n\nor remain in the United States.             8 U.S.C. § 1255(e).21         The statute\n\nis   clear   that    even    if    these    individuals    were    \"inspected    and\n\nadmitted     or   paroled\"     and     complied    with    the    other    statutory\n\nrequirements, they are not eligible to apply.\n\n             There   are     two    themes.       First,   Congress       explicitly\n\nrendered ineligible a certain category of aliens to apply. Second,\n\nthat    category     of     excluded    aliens    included       some   in   removal\n\nproceedings, but Congress chose not to disqualify from eligibility\n\nall of those aliens \"inspected and admitted or paroled\" in removal\n\nor other judicial proceedings. In those limited circumstances when\n\nthe involvement in proceedings works to hamper an individual's\n\nability to adjust status, Congress has explicitly said so.\n\n             Third, Congress also has determined that some aliens whom\n\nit has deemed ineligible under 8 U.S.C. § 1255(c) might in some\n\nlimited circumstances still be eligible for adjustment of status\n\n\n\n       21\n      This section does not apply if \"the alien establishes by\nclear and convincing evidence to the satisfaction of the Attorney\nGeneral that the marriage was entered into in good faith and in\naccordance with the laws of the place where the marriage took place\nand the marriage was not entered into for the purpose of procuring\nthe alien's admission as an immigrant.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1255(e)(3).\n\n                                           -38-\n\frelief.     For example, in 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i), Congress allows\n\nadjustment of status for certain aliens who entered the United\n\nStates without inspection or who are categorized in section 1255(c)\n\nof the statute as being ineligible.          Congress states that if these\n\naliens    are   beneficiaries        of    either   \"(i)   a    petition      for\n\nclassification under [8 U.S.C. §] 1154 . . . that was filed with\n\nthe Attorney General on or before April 30, 2001; or (ii) an\n\napplication     for    a   labor   certification      under    [8    U.S.C.    §]\n\n1182(a)(5)(A) . . . that was filed . . . on or before such date,\"\n\nthen they \"may apply to the Attorney General for adjustment of . .\n\n. status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent\n\nresidence.\"     See 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i).22        When Congress has wanted to\n\nimpose    special     restrictions    on   the   applications       for   certain\n\ncategories of aliens that it has deemed eligible, or conversely to\n\nopen up eligibility for aliens that were ineligible, it has done so\n\n\n\n     22\n      The statute provides that the \"Attorney General may accept\nsuch application only if the alien remits with such application a\nsum equaling $1,000 as of the date of receipt of the application.\"\n8 U.S.C. § 1255(i)(1) (emphasis added). \"Upon receipt of such an\napplication and the sum hereby required, the Attorney General may\nadjust the status of the alien to that of an alien lawfully\nadmitted for permanent residence,\" if the alien meets certain\nstatutory requirements. 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i)(2) (emphasis added).\nThis particular provision gives further weight to Congress's\nintention to distinguish between the two steps necessary for\nadjustment of status: (1) eligibility to apply and (2) a favorable\ndetermination by the Attorney General. Section 1255(i), unlike the\nother provisions governing who is eligible to apply for adjustment\nof status, seems to give the Attorney General some discretion over\nwhether these aliens are even eligible to apply, as well as over\nthe decision whether to adjust.\n\n                                      -39-\n\fexplicitly.   But Congress has imposed no restrictions on applying\n\nfor adjustment of status for a paroled alien based on that alien's\n\nbeing in removal proceedings.\n\n2.   Context of the Statutory Scheme\n\n           The terms and provisions of 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a) must be\n\nunderstood in the larger context of the statutory scheme.      The\n\nimmigration laws about adjustment of status are not a haphazard\n\ncompilation of provisions; they are a calibrated set of rules that\n\ngovern an area of national importance.   Congress in many instances\n\nhas specifically determined when to give discretion to the Attorney\n\nGeneral and when to make its own policy choices.       Viewing the\n\nstatutory scheme in this manner clarifies two things: first, that\n\nthe exclusion of parolees in removal proceedings renders ineligible\n\nmost of the class that Congress rendered eligible by including\n\nparolees (for Congress clearly stated that most parolees would be\n\nin removal proceedings), and second, that the congressional choice\n\nto delegate to the Attorney General some circumscribed discretion\n\n\n\n\n                                -40-\n\fover the ultimate decision of who is granted adjustment of status23\n\nis not authorization for discretion in other areas.\n\n           We explain: one policy choice Congress made was to allow\n\n(in some instances) aliens who were otherwise inadmissible on\n\narrival the opportunity to seek adjustment of status relief if they\n\nmet certain statutory criteria.    See 8 U.S.C. § 1255.   In 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1182, Congress defines the classes of aliens who are ineligible\n\nfor visas or admission to the United States and makes various\n\nexceptions from these blanket rules.      See 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a).\n\nCongress also allows for parole of these inadmissible aliens for\n\n\"urgent humanitarian reasons\" or \"significant public benefit.\"      8\n\nU.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A).   Congress specifically says parolees are\n\nnot   considered   admitted.      Id.   Despite   their   status   as\n\ninadmissible, Congress has also made the policy determination that\n\n\n      23\n      \"If the word 'discretion' means anything in a statutory or\nadministrative grant of power, it means that the recipient must\nexercise his authority according to his own understanding and\nconscience.\" See Goncalves, 144 F.3d at 125 (quoting United States\nex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260, 266-67 (1954))\n(internal quotation marks omitted)(alteration in Goncalves)\n(emphasis added). This comports with a doctrine articulated by\nJudge Jerome Frank in United States ex rel. Adel v. Shaughnessy,\n183 F.2d 371 (2d Cir. 1950), that where Congress has granted an\nagency discretion, courts may intervene when there has been \"a\nclear failure to exercise discretion\" (as well as when that\ndiscretion has been abused). Id. at 372. In later formulations,\ncourts have said that an agency’s \"failure to . . . exercise its\ndiscretion, when properly called upon to do so, is subject to\njudicial review for arbitrariness and capriciousness.\" Wolfe v.\nMarsh, 835 F.2d 354, 358 (D.C. Cir. 1987).     Here, the Attorney\nGeneral must actually exercise his discretion to determine whether\nthe paroled individuals that Congress has deemed eligible for\nadjustment of status should be granted this relief.\n\n                               -41-\n\fthese paroled aliens should be eligible to apply for adjustment of\n\nstatus, which essentially can act as an admission.             8 U.S.C. §\n\n1255(a).\n\n           Section   1182   is    integral   to   determinations   made    in\n\n\"inspection,\" which is provided for in 8 U.S.C. § 1225.                   All\n\narriving aliens and aliens who are present in the United States\n\nwithout an inspection are \"applicants for admission,\" 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1225(a)(1), and they \"shall be inspected.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1225(a)(3)\n\n(emphasis added).    Section 1225(b) provides for the inspection of\n\naliens arriving in the United States and certain other aliens who\n\nhave not been admitted or paroled.           See 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b).      If\n\naliens being   inspected    are    not   \"clearly   and   beyond   a   doubt\"\n\nadmissible, under section 1182, then they must be referred to\n\nremoval proceedings.    See 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(2)(A).\n\n           This context shows that Congress purposefully classified\n\nparoled individuals as \"inadmissible,\" and it also determined that\n\nthey should generally be placed in removal proceedings.                   But\n\nCongress also explicitly allowed paroled individuals to adjust\n\nstatus if they meet the other statutory requirements.\n\n           Further, the larger statutory scheme makes clear that in\n\nthe context of adjustment of status, Congress is particular about\n\nwhere it grants \"discretion\" to the Attorney General. Congress has\n\nspecified the conditions under which an arriving alien (including\n\na paroled alien) is to be determined inadmissible and must be\n\n\n                                    -42-\n\fplaced in removal proceedings.     The determination as to placing an\n\nalien into removal is not a decision committed to agency discretion\n\nby Congress. Rather, Congress has defined the terms for initiating\n\nremoval   proceedings   against    arriving   aliens   in   8   U.S.C.   §\n\n1225(b)(2)(A), which provides that,\n\n          [I]n the case of an alien who is an applicant\n          for admission, if the examining immigration\n          officer determines that an alien seeking\n          admission is not clearly and beyond a doubt\n          entitled to be admitted, the alien shall be\n          detained for a [removal proceeding].\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(2)(A).         Congress used the word \"shall\" to\n\nmandate that an immigration officer who cannot determine that the\n\napplicant for admission is clearly entitled to be admitted has no\n\nchoice but to place the alien in removal proceedings.           After the\n\nalien is placed in removal, the Attorney General may parole the\n\nalien into the United States in some instances,24 but the alien\n\nstill must go through removal proceedings.25\n\n\n     24\n       The Attorney General's ability to parole arriving aliens,\nboth prior to removal proceedings and once the individual is placed\nin removal proceedings, is also constrained. The Attorney General\ncan parole an alien applying for admission temporarily into the\nUnited States \"only on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian\nreasons or significant public benefit.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A).\nThe Attorney General has no authority to allow an individual to\nremain in parole once the reasons for the initial parole are\nexhausted.   As soon as a determination that these reasons are\nexhausted is made, the individual \"shall forthwith return or be\nreturned to the custody\" of the Service. 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A).\n     25\n      Indeed, where Congress has wanted to benefit aliens from\ncertain countries, it has enacted special legislation which allows\nthese individuals to enter the United States and apply for\npermanent resident status within one year, without being subjected\n\n                                  -43-\n\f          The incorrectness of the Attorney General's argument can\n\nbe seen by looking at one of its logical implications.         The\n\nAttorney General is also given discretion as to the ultimate\n\ndecision in determining whether to grant asylum to aliens who are\n\neligible for this relief. 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a); Cardoza-Fonseca, 480\n\nU.S. at 443-44.26    If this grant of discretion meant what the\n\ngovernment argues here, it would be logical that the Attorney\n\nGeneral could similarly decline to allow asylum by issuing a\n\nregulation that refused to process applications from categories of\n\nasylum applicants.\n\n\n\n\nto removal proceedings. See Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966, Pub. L.\nNo. 89-732, 80 Stat. 1161 (1966) (allowing Cuban parolees to adjust\nstatus after one year of residence in the United States);\nLautenberg Amendment, Pub. L. No. 101-167, 103 Stat. 1263 (1990)\n(allowing parolees from the former Soviet Union, Vietnam, Laos, or\nCambodia to adjust status after one year of residence in the United\nStates).\n     26\n      In Cardoza-Fonseca, the Attorney General argued that the\ngreater standard applicable to withholding of deportation--the\nalien's life or freedom would be threatened--was also the standard\napplicable to the grant of asylum because it was anomalous that the\nstandard for asylum, which affords greater benefits, would be less\nburdensome than the standard for withholding of deportation.\nCardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. at 443. The Supreme Court distinguished\nthe two statutes to show why the Attorney General's argument was\nmisplaced. The Court explained that if an individual makes the\nstronger showing and demonstrates that he is eligible for\nwithholding of deportation, that relief is automatic without any\ndiscretion of the Attorney General. By contrast, if an individual\ndemonstrates the lesser well-founded fear standard to be\nstatutorily eligible for asylum, the relief was not automatic; it\nwas then up to the Attorney General to exercise his discretion as\nto whether to grant the requested relief. Id. at 443-44.\n\n                               -44-\n\f            But that is not so.     If the asylum applicant meets the\n\neligibility requirements –- if, in other words, the Attorney\n\nGeneral determines that an applicant for asylum establishes she has\n\n\"a well founded fear of persecution\" on account of one of the\n\nstatutory grounds –- the alien must be allowed to apply.               The\n\nAttorney General may only exercise his discretion in granting the\n\nasylum.27     8   U.S.C.   §   1158(b);   8   U.S.C.   §   1101(a)(42)(A).\n\nSimilarly, if the paroled adjustment of status applicant meets the\n\neligibility requirements, the Attorney General may exercise his\n\ndiscretion only in the decision whether to grant permanent resident\n\nstatus.     In both asylum and adjustment of status, an alien who\n\nsatisfies the eligibility requirements to apply \"does not have a\n\nright to the [relief],\" but he is \"eligible\" to apply for it.\n\nCardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. at 443-44 (emphasis removed).\n\n            Although the regulation, 8 C.F.R. § 245.1(c)(8), denying\n\nadjustment of status to parolees in removal proceedings is itself\n\nframed in terms of who is eligible to apply, the Attorney General\n\n\n\n     27\n      It is worth noting that the asylum statute as in force at the\ntime it was interpreted in Cardoza-Fonseca, is similar in wording\nto the adjustment of status statute. The relevant provision in\n1987 read:\n\n     [T]he alien may be granted asylum in the discretion of\n     the Attorney general if the Attorney General determines\n     that such alien is a refugee within the meaning of\n     section 1101(a)(42)(A) [the well-founded fear standard]\n     of this title.\n\nCardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. at 427 (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)).\n\n                                   -45-\n\fargues the regulation is simply a determination at the outset that\n\nof the eligible parolees, the Attorney General will not exercise\n\nits discretion favorably to those who are in removal proceedings.\n\nThe Attorney General relies on Lopez v. Davis, 531 U.S. 230 (2001),\n\nfor the proposition that categorically excluding otherwise eligible\n\nindividuals is an appropriate use of his discretion as to the\n\nultimate decision granted in 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a).\n\n            Lopez is distinguishable.        In Lopez, the Supreme Court\n\nupheld a regulation of the Bureau of Prisons (BOP), 28 C.F.R. §\n\n550.58(a)(1)(vi)(B), which categorically denied early release to\n\nprisoners whose current offense was a drug felony involving the\n\ncarrying, possession, or use of a firearm.           See Lopez, 531 U.S. at\n\n233. The relevant statute states, \"The period a prisoner convicted\n\nof a nonviolent offense remains in custody after successfully\n\ncompleting a treatment program may be reduced by the [BOP], but\n\nsuch reduction may not be more than one year from the term the\n\nprisoner must otherwise serve.\"         18 U.S.C. § 3621(e)(2)(B).       The\n\nSupreme Court framed the question as whether \"the Bureau has\n\ndiscretion to delineate, as an additional category of ineligible\n\ninmates, those whose current offense is a felony involving a\n\nfirearm.\"      Lopez, 531 U.S. at 238.          The Court answered this\n\nquestion in the affirmative, agreeing with the BOP that \"Congress\n\nsimply   did   not   address   how   the    Bureau   should   exercise   its\n\ndiscretion within the class of inmates who satisfy the statutory\n\n\n                                     -46-\n\fprerequisites    for    early   release.\"      Id.    at    239-40   (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).       The Court noted:\n\n            Beyond instructing that the Bureau has\n            discretion    to    reduce  the    period   of\n            imprisonment for a nonviolent offender who\n            successfully     completes  drug    treatment,\n            Congress has not identified any further\n            circumstance in which the Bureau either must\n            grant the reduction, or is forbidden to do so.\n            In this familiar situation, where Congress has\n            enacted a law that does not answer \"the\n            precise question at issue,\" all we must decide\n            is whether the Bureau, the agency empowered to\n            administer the early release program, has\n            filled the statutory gap \"in a way that is\n            reasonable in light of the legislature's\n            revealed design.\"\n\nId. at 242 (emphasis added)(quoting Nations Bank of N.C., N.A. v.\n\nVariable Annuity Life Ins. Co., 513 U.S. 251, 257 (1995)).              In the\n\nface of congressional silence, the Court held that it was not\n\nunreasonable for the BOP to exercise its discretion and exclude a\n\nclass of prisoners as ineligible for early release. Id. at 242-43.\n\n            By contrast, Congress has not been silent here.             There\n\nare differences in the two statutes.         In the adjustment of status\n\nstatute here, Congress made numerous and explicit policy choices\n\nabout who is eligible for adjustment of status relief, who is\n\nineligible, and of those ineligible, who is nonetheless eligible\n\nwith certain application restrictions.              See 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a)\n\n(setting out basic eligibility requirements for adjustment of\n\nstatus); 8 U.S.C. §§ 1255(c), (e) (limiting the eligibility of\n\notherwise    eligible    aliens);    8     U.S.C.    §     1255(i)   (allowing\n\n\n                                    -47-\n\feligibility        to    otherwise     ineligible      aliens).      The   statutory\n\nimmigration        scheme      also    constrains      the    Attorney     General's\n\ndiscretion in several ways,             including mandating when an arriving\n\nalien      must    be    placed   in     removal    proceedings,      8    U.S.C.   §\n\n1225(b)(2)(A), limiting the discretion of the Attorney General to\n\nparole aliens, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5), and denying the Attorney\n\nGeneral the ultimate discretion to adjust the status of some\n\notherwise eligible aliens, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(f).                  Lopez is a Chevron\n\nstep two case because of congressional silence; our case, however,\n\nis a Chevron step one case because Congress has clearly spoken on\n\nthe   issue       of    eligibility.      We    find    the    Attorney    General's\n\nregulation         to     be    inconsistent        with      that   congressional\n\ndetermination.          See Ragsdale v. Wolverine World Wide, Inc., 535\n\nU.S. 81, 91 (2002).28\n\n\n      28\n      Our holding does not \"preclude the [Attorney General] from\nadopting a uniform set of criteria for consideration in evaluating\napplications\" for adjustment of status. Lopez, 531 U.S. at 249\n(Stevens, J., dissenting). We agree that Congress's eligibility\ndeterminations do not limit the considerations that \"may guide the\nAttorney General in exercising [his] discretion to determine who,\namong those eligible, will be accorded grace.\" Lopez, 531 U.S. at\n243 (quoting INS v. Yueh-Shaio Yang, 519 U.S. 26, 31 (1996)\n(internal quotation marks omitted)).\n     However, there is one important point: because eligibility is\nexplicit   in   this   statute,  the   Attorney   General   cannot\ncategorically refuse to exercise discretion favorably for classes\ndeemed eligible by the statute. The agency cannot get in through\nthe back door of the relief stage what it cannot do at the\neligibility stage. This limitation is consistent with Yueh-Shaio\nYang, which did not involve the agency excluding a class of\notherwise eligible aliens. Lopez, 531 U.S. at 248 n.4 (Stevens,\nJ., dissenting).      It involved the question of whether a\nclassification could be considered at all in the exercise of the\n\n                                         -48-\n\f           From the language and structure of the statute alone, we\n\nfind the regulation to be inconsistent with the expressed intent of\n\nCongress.29   Still, we do not lightly overturn regulations.\n\nD.   Legislative History\n\n          Questions have been raised about the appropriateness of\n\nuse of legislative history at stage one of the Chevron analysis.\n\nSee, e.g., Coke v. Long Island Care at Home, Ltd., 376 F.3d 118,\n\n127 (2d Cir. 2004).   In fact, the Supreme Court has often referred\n\nto legislative history at stage one, most recently in Gen. Dynamics\n\nLand Sys., Inc. v. Cline, 124 S. Ct. 1236, 1243 (2004), and in a\n\nseries of earlier cases.    See FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco\n\nCorp., 529 U.S. 120, 133 (2000) (using \"later [congressional] Acts\"\n\nwhich spoke \"more specifically to the topic at hand\" to determine\n\nwhether the statute evidenced a clear congressional intent in\n\n\nAttorney General's ultimate discretion to grant relief from\ndeportation.   Id.    Perhaps whether the alien is in removal\nproceedings could be a consideration in the weighing against the\nfavorable exercise of discretion, but it cannot be the basis of a\ncategorical exclusion.\n     29\n      The Attorney General also relies on INS v. Bagamasbad, 429\nU.S. 24 (1976), to support his argument. There the IJ and BIA had,\nwithout determining eligibility, relied on the petitioner's\nmisrepresentation to a consular office to deny adjustment of\nstatus. The court of appeals concluded that a determination of\neligibility was required nonetheless. The Supreme Court reversed\nthe court of appeals on the ground that “[a]s a general rule[,]\ncourts and agencies are not required to make findings on issues the\ndecision of which is unnecessary to the results they reach.\" Id.\nat 25. The case does not provide much guidance here. Petitioner\nargues only that Congress, by setting conditions for eligibility,\nwished there to be case by case consideration.      In Bagamasbad,\nthere was individualized consideration of the case.\n\n                                -49-\n\fChevron step one); MCI Telecomms. v. AT&T, 512 U.S. 218, 232-33\n\n(1994) (examining legislative histories of later enactments and\n\nfinding them inconclusive);      Pauley, 501 U.S. at 697-99 (examining\n\nthe text of statute and legislative history to determine that\n\nCongress intended to delegate to the agency broad policymaking\n\ndiscretion); Pension Benefit Guar.

LTV Corp., 496 U.S.\n\n633, 648-50 (1990) (using legislative history in Chevron step one\n\nas   another    \"traditional   tool[]   of   statutory   construction\"   to\n\nconclude that the statute did not \"evince a clear congressional\n\nintent\"); Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hosp., 488 U.S. 204, 214 (1988)\n\n(using legislative history as a check where statutory text is clear\n\nthat the Secretary had no authority); Japan Whaling Ass'n v. Am.\n\nCetacean Soc'y, 478 U.S. 221, 233-41 (1986) (examining legislative\n\nhistory and determining that Congress has not directly spoken to\n\nthe issue).30\n\n\n\n      30\n      The most frequently cited source for a purported rule that\nreference to legislative history is impermissible at stage one is\nJustice Kennedy's statement, in a footnote, that the use of\nlegislative history in stage one is impermissible.      See K Mart\nCorp. v. Cartier, Inc., 486 U.S. 281, 293 n.4 (1988) (noting in the\nfirst step of a Chevron inquiry that \"any reference to legislative\nhistory is in the first instance irrelevant\"). However, Justice\nKennedy's analysis on this point did not command a majority; only\none other Justice joined. Id. And since the decision in K Mart\nCorp., Justice Kennedy has joined the majority opinions in Pension\nBenefit and Brown & Williamson Tobacco, both of which utilize\nlegislative history in the Chevron step one analysis. See Pension\nBenefit Guar. Corp., 496 U.S. at 649-50; Brown & Williamson Tobacco\nCorp., 529 U.S. at 133.       The footnote in K Mart was never\nauthoritative.\n\n\n                                   -50-\n\f              Our view is that where traditional doctrines of statutory\n\ninterpretation have permitted use of legislative history, its use\n\nis permissible and even may be required at stage one of Chevron.\n\nThis appears to be the functional approach of some other circuits\n\nas well.      See Coke, 376 F.3d at 127 (using legislative history at\n\nstep    one   \"without   attaching     primacy\"     to    it);    Am.   Rivers   v.\n\nF.E.R.C., 201 F.3d 1186, 1196 & n.16 (9th Cir. 2000) (adhering to\n\nthe practice of considering legislative history in Chevron step\n\none).\n\n              Our approach encompasses the traditional rule that where\n\nthe plain text of the statute is unmistakably clear on its face,\n\nthere is no need to discuss legislative history.                    See Sutton v.\n\nUnited Airlines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471, 481 (1999).                 Sutton, however,\n\ndoes not go on to say that resort to legislative history is\n\nimpermissible where used as a check on the understanding of the\n\nstatute as viewed in light of its text and the statutory scheme as\n\na   whole.      Even   the   dissent   in     General    Dynamics    admits   that\n\nlegislative history may confirm whether the plain text reading is\n\ncorrect.       Gen. Dynamics Land Sys., Inc., 124 S. Ct. at 1252\n\n(Thomas, J., dissenting) (\"Although the statute is clear, and hence\n\nthere is no need to delve into the legislative history, this\n\nhistory merely confirms that the plain reading of the text is\n\ncorrect.\").      Indeed, Justice Thomas's dissent (joined by Justice\n\nKennedy) itself considers legislative history.

See Goldings v.\n\nWinn, 383 F.3d 17, 21 (1st Cir. 2004) (\"If the language of the\n\nstatute is plain and admits of no more than one meaning or if the\n\nstatute's legislative history reveals an unequivocal answer as to\n\nthe statute's meaning, we do not look to the interpretation that\n\nmay be given to the statute by the agency charged with its\n\nenforcement\") (emphasis added) (quoting Arnold v.

As\n\n\n                                    -52-\n\fwe shall see, the legislative history, which is not disputed by the\n\nrespondent,    seems    to   pose   none    of   the   problems   of   potential\n\nmanipulation     of    the   system    by    members     of   Congress.      See\n\nStrickland, 48 F.3d at 17 n.3 (reciting the arguments of critics\n\nthat \"legislative history is written by staffers rather than by\n\nCongress itself; that it is easily manipulated; that it complicates\n\nthe tasks of execution and obedience; and that it often is shaped\n\nby members of Congress who cannot achieve passage of a desired\n\ninterpretation in the actual text of an enacted statute\").\n\n          In light of Supreme Court case law there is no reason to\n\nthink legislative history may not play other roles then simply\n\nconfirming a reading obtained by text and structure at stage one.31\n\nOur use of the legislative history in that fashion is, we think,\n\nunexceptional.\n\n\n\n     31\n      In fact, the Supreme Court has used legislative history in\ndifferent ways at stage one.    It has used it merely to confirm\nplain text reading. Pension Benefit Guar. Corp., 496 U.S. at 649;\nBowen, 488 U.S. at 214; Japan Whaling Ass'n, 478 U.S. at 233-41.\nIt has used legislative history to give content to specific\nstatutory terms said to have different textual meanings.       Gen.\nDynamics Land Sys., Inc., 124 S. Ct. at 1244 (statutory term \"age\"\nin ADEA refers to use of ADEA as a remedy for \"unfair preference\nbased on relative youth\"). In Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp.,\nthe Supreme Court stressed that \"a reviewing court should not\nconfine itself to examining a particular statutory provision in\nisolation.\" 529 U.S. at 132. In addition to the requirement to\nread the text in context and in light of its place in the overall\nstatutory scheme, the court also found permissible resort to \"other\nActs, particularly where Congress has spoken subsequently and more\nspecifically to the topic at hand.\" Id. at 133. The court then\nexplored the legislative history of both the original and later\nstatutes. Id. at 144-55.\n\n                                      -53-\n\f           We look to legislative history to check our understanding\n\nand determine whether there is a clearly expressed intention by the\n\nCongress which is contrary to the plain language of the statute.\n\nSee Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. at 432 & n.12.         Petitioner argues\n\nthat the legislative history evidences Congress's intention to give\n\nparolees, regardless of whether they were in removal proceedings,\n\nthe ability to adjust status and that this intention is consistent\n\nwith the goals Congress wanted to accomplish in enacting the\n\nlegislation.\n\n           The INA, enacted in 1952, allowed \"[t]he status of an\n\nalien who was lawfully admitted to the United States as a bona fide\n\nnonimmigrant\" to be adjusted to that of permanent resident alien if\n\nthe alien met certain other eligibility requirements.        Pub. L. No.\n\n414, 66 Stat. 163, 217 (1952).\n\n           The version of 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a) relevant to this case\n\nwas established in 1960, when Congress amended 8 U.S.C. § 1255 to\n\ninclude paroled aliens as eligible for adjustment of status.            Pub.\n\nL. No. 86-648, 74 Stat. 504, 505 (1960).      At the time the amendment\n\nwas passed, the statutory provision for the granting of parole to\n\ncertain   inadmissible   aliens   was    substantially   similar   to    the\n\nstatute governing parole today.32\n\n\n     32\n      \"The Attorney General may in his discretion parole into the\nUnited States temporarily under such conditions as he may prescribe\nfor emergent reasons or for reasons deemed strictly in the public\ninterest any alien. . . .\" INA, Pub. L. No. 414, 66 Stat. 188\n(1952).\n\n                                  -54-\n\f           The    legislative   history   of   the   1960   amendments    is\n\nexplicit   that   Congress   recognized   numerous    problems   with    the\n\nprocess for adjustment of status under the 1952 law and believed\n\nthese problems were of serious concern.        The Senate Report states:\n\n                  The Administrative Operations in the\n           application of [the adjustment of status\n           provision], and other related features of the\n           General Immigration Law regarding adjustment\n           of status of aliens within the United States,\n           have been the subject of close scrutiny by the\n           Committees on the Judiciary of both the Senate\n           and the House of Representatives.       For a\n           considerable period of time, there has\n           appeared to be a steadily mounting number of\n           cases in which aliens determined by the\n           Immigration and Naturalization Service to be\n           eligible for permanent residence in the United\n           States in accordance with all the applicable\n           provisions of the Immigration and Nationality\n           Act, had to comply with what appeared in those\n           cases to be an unnecessary procedure known as\n           preexamination and voluntary departure with a\n           view toward applying for an immigrant visa in\n           one of the U.S. Consular Offices in Canada.\n           During the Fiscal Year ending June 30, 1958,\n           more than 7,000 aliens in the United States\n           had their eligibility to enter as immigrants\n           determinated in this country prior to sending\n           them to Canada where they briefly appeared\n           before a U.S. consular officer, and then\n           returned to this country with an immigrant\n           visa.\n\n                  In    addition,  the    review   of   a\n           considerable    number  of    private   relief\n           immigration bills seeking adjustment of status\n           of nonimmigrants has further demonstrated to\n           the Committee the desirability of general\n           amendatory legislation on this subject.\n\nS. Rep. No. 86-1651 (1960), reprinted in 1960 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3124,\n\n3136.\n\n\n                                  -55-\n\f           The   Report   states   that   Congress,   in   amending   the\n\nadjustment of status statute, wished to avoid a situation that,\n\n           not only necessitate[s] the reinstatement of\n           the    fallacious     procedure     known   as\n           'preexamination' and consisting of round trips\n           to Canada for the sole purpose of obtaining an\n           immigrant visa, but will certainly greatly\n           increase the number of private bills.      The\n           Congress   has    repeatedly    expressed  its\n           disapproval of the 'preexamination' procedure\n           and    has     similarly     expressed     its\n           dissatisfaction with the mounting volume of\n           private legislation.\n\nId. at 3137.\n\n           In response to those problems, Congress in 1960 amended\n\nthe adjustment of status provision.       The new provision read: \"The\n\nstatus of an alien, other than an alien crewman, who was inspected\n\nand admitted or paroled into the United States may be adjusted . .\n\n. to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence .\n\n. . .\"    74 Stat. at 505.    This change broadened the category of\n\nindividuals eligible for adjustment of status relief.        S. Rep. No.\n\n86-1651 (1960), reprinted in 1960 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3124, 3125.33\n\n\n     33\n      The 1960 legislation can be viewed as striking a balance --\nwhile it broadened the number of aliens able to apply for\nadjustment of status, it also defined the category of aliens\neligible so that only the deserving could be considered for the\nrelief. This structure comports with Congress's concern to allow\nonly worthy aliens the opportunity to apply for adjustment of\nstatus. As the Senate Report states,\n\n     The language of the instant bill has been carefully drawn\n     so as not to grant undeserved benefits to the unworthy or\n     undesirable immigrant. This legislation will not benefit\n     the alien who has entered the United States in violation\n     of the law.\n\n                                   -56-\n\f            In changing the system, Congress sought to ameliorate\n\nthree types of problems caused by the old system.               Congress wished\n\nto eliminate the burden on inspected and admitted or paroled aliens\n\nand their American relatives of having to leave the United States\n\nand apply from a consular office abroad (often from Canada).34                See\n\nid. at 3137    (\"Aliens eligible to benefit from this legislation .\n\n. . would also save the expense of journeys to Canada, rather high\n\nwhen    consideration    is   given    to    the   fact   that    many   of   the\n\nprospective eligible immigrants live with their families in areas\n\nrather remote from the U.S. Consular offices in Canada.\").\n\n            Congress    was   also    concerned    with   the    costs   to   the\n\ngovernment of the then extant system, caused by the large number of\n\nprivate bills presented to it for adjustment of status for named\n\n\n\nS. Rep. No. 86-1651 (1960), reprinted in 1960 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3124,\n3136. Congress mentioned that it believed that the legislation\nwould benefit mainly aliens \"who[] are spouses of U.S. citizens, or\nskilled specialists whose services are urgently needed in the\nUnited States, or ministers of religious denominations, or members\nof other general or special nonquota immigrant classes.\" Id. at\n3137.    Congress also specifically intended to benefit those\nindividuals who had been paroled into the country as refugees. Id.\nat 3124.\n       34\n      The specific focus of Congress on these problems of who may\napply for adjustment of status and how also indicates that Congress\nconsidered the matter to be important, and so did not leave it to\nthe agency. See Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. at 159\n(citing Justice Stephen Breyer, Judicial Review of Questions of Law\nand Policy, 38 Admin. L. Rev. 363, 370 (1986) (\"A court may also\nask whether the legal question is an important one. Congress is\nmore likely to have focused upon, and answered, major questions,\nwhile leaving interstitial matters to answer themselves in the\ncourse of the statute's daily administration.\")).\n\n                                      -57-\n\findividuals.          Congress      had    repeatedly        expressed     its\n\n\"dissatisfaction with the mounting volume of private legislation\"\n\nintroduced to adjust the status of certain aliens.              Id. at 3137.\n\nBy adopting the 1960 legislation, Congress wished to alleviate this\n\nburden on itself.     See id. at 3136.     There is some evidence in the\n\nlegislative history that Congress wished also to alleviate the\n\nburden imposed on consular offices to process applications for\n\nadjustment of status.     The Senate Report emphasizes that in fiscal\n\nyear 1958, alone, over 7,000 individuals had to leave the Untied\n\nStates and apply for a visa in Canada.        Id. Indeed, the Department\n\nof State commented on the legislation.\n\n            Finally, in expanding the group of individuals eligible\n\nfor    adjustment    of   status,    Congress    clearly      evaluated    the\n\nadministrative inconvenience to the INS of the expanded category of\n\nthose eligible to apply for adjustment of status and nonetheless\n\naltered the prior procedure. Indeed, the administrative burdens of\n\nthe various provisions involved were given \"close scrutiny\" by\n\nCongress.    Id.\n\n            The effect of the regulation before us, limiting the\n\nability of paroled aliens in removal proceedings to adjust status,\n\nwill   predictably   be   to   re-institute     the   very   problems     which\n\nCongress attempted to eliminate in 1960.         It forces paroled aliens\n\nin removal proceedings to leave the country to apply for adjustment\n\nof status.     This imposes considerable burdens on the aliens and,\n\n\n                                    -58-\n\fwhere applicable, their American spouses and relatives. The effect\n\nof the regulation, predictably, will be to increase the number of\n\nprivate   bills   seeking       individual     adjustment   of    status,   thus\n\nburdening Congress.        It will also increase the burden on consular\n\noffices abroad, because aliens who are otherwise available to\n\nadjust status will now have to apply through the consular office.\n\n           The 1960 legislative history of 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a)\n\nconfirms and enhances our understanding of the statute.\n\nE.   Effect of IIRIRA\n\n           We consider briefly the arguments of both sides that rely\n\non later revisions to the INA, specifically IIRIRA, to support\n\ntheir different understandings of what Congress meant in the\n\nadjustment of status provisions of 8 U.S.C. § 1255.                There is no\n\nclaim that section 1255(a) was amended by IIRIRA or any other\n\nstatute in any relevant way.\n\n           The Attorney General relies on provisions of IIRIRA to\n\nargue that the original understanding of the statute in 1960 must\n\nbe altered in light of later law, and the statute must now be read\n\nas introducing at least ambiguity into section 1255(a), despite the\n\nfact that section 1255(a) itself was not amended.                 The Attorney\n\nGeneral argues that new regulations were required due to IIRIRA's\n\nreplacement of \"entry\" with \"admission\" as the criterion which\n\ndetermines which of two sets of grounds of removal, 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1882(a) or   8    U.S.C.    §   1227,    applies   in   removal   proceedings.\n\n\n                                        -59-\n\fFurther,        the        Attorney    General          argues,          under    8    U.S.C.      §\n\n1182(d)(5)(A), a parole of an alien is not the admission of that\n\nalien.\n\n            Our earlier analysis of the meaning of 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a)\n\nin light of the statutory context takes into account the statutory\n\nscheme as it exists under IIRIRA. The Attorney General's arguments\n\ndo not change this understanding; they are unpersuasive because\n\nthey do not concern the eligibility of paroled aliens to apply for\n\nadjustment of status under section 1255(a) or in any way act to\n\nlimit the eligibility of paroled individuals –- a group Congress\n\nspecifically          deemed        eligible       –-        to     adjust       status.          The\n\nclassification of paroled aliens as \"not admitted\" is not new to\n\nthe   passage         of    IIRIRA    and    does       not       change    the    treatment      of\n\nparolees.       Also, the reclassification of aliens \"present pursuant\n\nto an entry\" to \"applicants for admission\" does not affect the\n\nstatus     of    paroled        aliens,      who    have           always    been     considered\n\napplicants for admission.\n\n                The    petitioner        relies         on        IIRIRA    for     two     points.\n\nSpecifically, the petitioner argues that since 1960 the agency and\n\nCongress    have           consistently      understood            the     statute     to    be    as\n\npetitioner reads it.                 Moreover, in the major revisions of the\n\nimmigration laws since 1960, which largely restricted aliens'\n\nefforts    to     remain       in     this   country,             Congress    has     never    once\n\n\n\n\n                                             -60-\n\frestricted the ability of paroled aliens to apply for adjustment of\n\nstatus.\n\n          This confirms our understanding of the clear meaning of\n\nthe statute.35   Consistent with our interpretation of the statute,\n\nin our view, the changes to the statute with the passage of IIRIRA\n\nwork against the Attorney General's argument, not in favor of it.\n\nUnder IIRIRA and previous amendments, Congress amended section 1255\n\nto limit the eligibility for adjustment of status so that certain\n\ntypes of aliens may not apply.   Historical & Statutory Notes, 1996\n\nAmendments, 8 U.S.C.A. § 1255. Congress has directly addressed the\n\nissue of eligibility for adjustment of status on several occasions,\n\nyet these amendments did not limit the category of paroled aliens\n\nwho may apply for adjustment of status, and they neither gave the\n\nAttorney General discretion to redefine eligibility nor did they\n\nendorse the additional restrictions on eligibility contained in the\n\nAttorney General's regulation.     See Brown & Williamson Tobacco,\n\nCorp., 529 U.S. at 137 (relying in part on later actions of\n\nCongress which specifically address the regulation of tobacco as\n\n\n\n     35\n      When Congress speaks \"subsequently and more specifically to\nthe topic at hand,\" this can shed light as to the meaning of the\nstatute.

Morgan, 486 U.S. 330 (1988)\n(When Congress has amended a statute in other ways, but not\naddressed the specific issue in question, court can consider\ncongressional silence in the appropriate historical context and use\nit as evidence of congressional intent not to abrogate well-\nestablished doctrine.).\n\n\n                                 -61-\n\fevidence that the FDA did not have authority to regulate tobacco).\n\nF.   Reasonableness\n\n            Many of the Attorney General’s arguments go to the\n\nreasonableness of the regulation.          This is a Chevron step two\n\nargument.    But as previously explained, this is a Chevron step one\n\ncase, and even the Attorney General’s reasonable actions cannot\n\ncontrol in the face of clear contrary congressional intent.\n\n            Even where there is ambiguity, reasonableness is assessed\n\nin light of the statutory scheme.           For example, the Attorney\n\nGeneral justifies the regulation on the basis that the exercise of\n\ndiscretion was consistent with Congress’s desire to speed up the\n\nremoval process through expedited removal proceedings.             62 Fed.\n\nReg. 444, 452 (Jan. 3, 1997).           The desire for administrative\n\nefficiency cannot displace clear congressional intent.\n\n            Also, the Attorney General argues he has a facially\n\nlegitimate and bona fide reason for the regulation, citing to the\n\nImmigration Control and Financial Responsibility Act of 1996,36\n\nwhich was intended to \"increase control over immigration . . .\n\nexpediting    the   removal   of   excludable   and   deportable   aliens,\n\nespecially criminal aliens, and reducing the abuse of parole and\n\n\n\n\n     36\n      The Immigration Control and Financial Responsibility Act of\n1996, SB 1664, was passed by the Senate on May 2, 1996. It was\nplaced in conference with the House counterpart, and was the\npredecessor of what became IIRIRA.\n\n                                    -62-\n\fasylum provisions.\"37 S. Rep. No. 104-249 at 2 (1994) (not reported\n\nin U.S.C.C.A.N.).      The short reply is that Congress did not, even\n\nin   1996,    give   the    Attorney   General   unfettered      discretion   to\n\nexpedite removal and reduce abuse of parole in disregard of the\n\nstatutory scheme.          Congress expressly did not alter the basic\n\nstructure of eligibility for application for adjustment of status\n\nwhile      simultaneously    making    a    limited   category    of   parolees\n\nineligible.      See Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. at 444-45 (noting the\n\nagency cannot ignore Congress’s desired scheme in the asylum area).\n\n              Finally, the position that the Attorney General takes in\n\nthe 1997 regulation is inconsistent with the agency’s long-standing\n\nprevious practice.         Arriving aliens in removal proceedings were\n\nalways able to adjust status before the district director prior to\n\nthe promulgation of the 1997 regulations. See In re Castro-Padron,\n\n21 I. & N. Dec. 379 (BIA 1996).            As noted in Cardoza-Fonseca, \"An\n\nadditional reason for rejecting the [Attorney General's] request\n\nfor heightened deference to [his] position is the inconsistency of\n\nthe positions the [agency] has taken through the years.                An agency\n\ninterpretation of a relevant provision which conflicts with the\n\nagency's earlier interpretation is 'entitled to considerably less\n\n\n      37\n      Legislative history of subsequently enacted statutes \"will\nrarely override a reasonable interpretation of a statute that can\nbe gleaned from its language and legislative history prior to its\nenactment.\" See Doe v. Chao, 124 S. Ct. 1204, 1212 (2004). An\nexpressed intent in the legislative history of a later more general\nstatute can not overcome the expressed intent in the statute\nspecifically in question.\n\n                                       -63-\n\fdeference' than a consistently held agency view.\" Cardoza-Fonseca,\n\n480 U.S. at 446 n.30 (quoting Watt v. Alaska, 451 U.S. 259, 273\n\n(1981)).   So even if there were ambiguity in section 1255(a), the\n\nagency would be entitled to less than normal deference.\n\n                                V.\n\n           We find the regulation, 8 C.F.R. § 245.1(c)(8), to be\n\ninvalid as inconsistent with 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a); accordingly we\n\nvacate the removal order and remand the case to the BIA for\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.   So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -64-\n\f",

The regulation redefines certain aliens as ineligible to apply for adjustment of status to lawful permanent residents whom a statute, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(a), defines as eligible to apply. Under that regulation, the Attorney General will not consider an application for adjustment of status from the entire category of aliens who have been granted parole status but have been placed in removal proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The essence of the Attorney General's argument is that since he has been given ultimate discretion to deny adjustment of status after application, the validity of the regulation is itself not subject to judicial review, and, if it were, the regulation must be upheld as a permissible exercise of that ultimate discretion. We disagree on both points. We hold that there is no statutory bar to review and that the regulation is contrary to the language and intent of the statute, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(a). As a result, we vacate the order removing Wissam Succar from the United States and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our reasons, which we explain in more depth below, are as follows. The mere fact that a statute gives the Attorney General discretion as to whether to grant relief after application does not by itself give the Attorney General the discretion to define eligibility for such relief. That is clear from <i>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca,</i> 480 U.S. 421, 443, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). Courts must still interpret the statute. Where the statute is silent on eligibility, the agency involved may reasonably choose to exercise its discretion to withhold relief by excluding certain persons from eligibility for such relief. <i>Lopez v. Davis,</i> 531 U.S. 230, 121 S.Ct. 714, 148 L.Ed.2d 635 (2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the statute is not silent &#8212; it defines persons who have parole status as eligible for adjustment of status and does not carve out an exception for parolees who are in removal proceedings. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255. That lack of a carve out for parolees in removal proceedings is itself significant, given that the statute contains a number of carve outs as to eligibility for adjustment of status. Some carve outs exclude persons from eligibility to apply who would otherwise meet more general eligibility requirements. Further, other carve outs create eligibility in persons otherwise ineligible. Congress thus has created a comprehensive scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewing the larger statutory context, we find Congress has also been explicit about where the Attorney General has been granted discretion and where he has not. By contrast with other areas, there is no explicit grant of discretion to redefine eligibility to apply for adjustment of status of parolees to exclude those in removal proceedings. Congress did not place the decision as to which applicants for admission are placed in removal proceedings into the discretion of the Attorney General, but created mandatory criteria. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1225(b)(1), (2). In addition, persons cannot be granted paroled status at all if they pose a security risk; they are to be ordered removed and this order must be reported to the Attorney General. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(c)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statutory scheme reflects Congress's careful balancing of the country's security needs against the national interests Congress wished to advance through adjustment of status proceedings. The regulation upsets the balance Congress created.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Checking our construction of the statute against the legislative history of section 1255, we find the regulation to be inconsistent with the intent expressed in the statute. In 1960, when Congress included paroled aliens as aliens who are eligible for adjustment of status relief through section 1255, it did so to solve certain problems, which we describe later. The effect of the regulation is to re-institute the problems Congress wished to solve. Further, until the 1997 promulgation of the regulation, the Attorney General had consistently interpreted section 1255 in a manner consistent with the statute and the legislative history and inconsistent with the 1997 regulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to the Attorney General's argument that the 1996 enactment of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) justifies the 1997 regulation, we note the Attorney General's concession that IIRIRA, which altered so much of the immigration laws, left untouched the language of section 1255, as enacted in 1960, on the matter in question. That being so, the relevance of the Attorney General's remaining arguments, largely based on general policy said to be embodied in IIRIRA, is doubtful. To the contrary, IIRIRA tends to strengthen, not weaken, the petitioner's claim that the regulation is invalid. Finally, the purported policy justifications of expediting removal of aliens and administrative ease must give way to clear congressional intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wissam Succar is a native and citizen of Lebanon. Succar arrived at Miami International Airport on October 21, 1998, when his flight from Lebanon to Panama stopped in the United States. He approached an official at the airport, stating that he wished to apply for asylum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An immigration officer questioned Succar at the airport. Because Succar did not have the proper documentation for admission, he was taken into government custody and held at the Krome detention facility in Miami, Florida. An asylum pre-screening officer met with Succar on November 19, 1998, and determined that he had a credible fear of persecution based on his involvement with the Christian militias in Lebanon. The officer found that the facts as recounted by Succar could establish his eligibility for asylum and a credible fear of harm on the basis of an imputed political opinion. Succar was placed into removal proceedings and was subsequently paroled into the United States on November 30, 1998. Succar has remained in parole status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over one year later, on January 19, 2000, Succar admitted the allegations in the Notice to Appear and conceded removability; he renewed his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. On March 1, 2000, a hearing was held on his asylum application and the trial was set for April 18, 2000. On April 18, after a hearing on the merits of his application, the Immigration Judge (IJ) denied Succar's request for asylum and withholding of removal. Succar appealed this decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 19, 2001, while his appeal was pending before the BIA and while he was paroled into the United States, Succar married a United States citizen. Succar's wife filed an immigrant visa petition for him, and the petition was approved on April 26, 2001. The approval form directed Succar to contact the local INS office to obtain Form I-485, the application for adjustment of status to a permanent resident. Believing that he met the statutory eligibility requirements for adjustment of status, on October 17, 2001, Succar filed a motion with the BIA to remand the proceedings to the IJ for consideration of his application for adjustment of status under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(a). This motion was unopposed by the INS.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The BIA granted the motion on December 18, 2001 and remanded the case to the IJ for further proceedings. The remand proved to be fruitless for the INS soon took the position that under 8 C.F.R. &#167; 245.1,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Succar was ineligible to apply for adjustment of status either before the IJ in the removal proceedings or, separately, before the Immigration Service's district director.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a July 29, 2002 hearing, Succar submitted his adjustment of status application to the IJ. In the middle of the hearing, the IJ stated that based on 8 C.F.R. &#167; 245.1, \"I am confident that I don't have the authority to adjust status to someone who's an arriving alien.\" The IJ denied the adjustment of status application as a matter of law, and then continued, \"The Immigration Service doesn't have the authority to adjust his status unless they are willing to terminate this case with me and if that be the case, I'll happily do it but I don't have the authority to terminate....\" In his oral decision of the same day, the IJ stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The respondent is an arriving alien and, therefore, he is not eligible to adjust status before the Immigration Judge. Additionally the respondent is not eligible to adjust status before the District Director of the Immigration Service in that he is in [removal] proceedings. As I indicated to both counsel, if the Immigration Service wished to have me terminate these proceedings or even to conditionally terminate them, I would have done so in order to afford the Immigration Service an opportunity to see whether an adjustment of status ought to be granted. However, that was not agreed to by the Immigration Service counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The regulations provide under 8 C.F.R.

An applicant for admission, also called an arriving alien, was an individual seeking admission who had not yet entered the country.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> After an inspection, if an applicant was not admitted, he or she was subject to an <i>exclusion</i> proceeding to determine admissibility into the United States. The second category, non-citizens who had previously made an entry, were treated as being present in the United States. They were subject to <i>deportation</i> proceedings to determine whether they would be deported or admitted to stay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1996, Congress passed IIRIRA. <i>See generally Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm.,</i> 525 U.S. 471, 119 S.Ct. 936, 142 L.Ed.2d 940 (1999); <i>Goncalves v. Reno,</i> 144 F.3d 110 (1st Cir.1998). Among many other changes, Congress eliminated the definition of the term \"entry\" and replaced it with the terms \"admission\" and \"admitted.\" <i>See</i> IIRIRA, Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-575 (1996). Admission and admitted now include only \"the <i>lawful</i> entry of the alien into the United States after inspection and authorization by an immigration officer.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(13)(A)(emphasis added). The main impact of this change is to re-characterize aliens who are present in the United States, but who have not been inspected and admitted. They are now considered \"applicants for admission\" along with other arriving aliens. The statute requires that all aliens who are seeking admission or readmission to the United States be inspected by immigration officers, prior to a determination of their status. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1225(a)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress also eliminated deportation and exclusion proceedings and replaced them with removal proceedings, which were applicable to all aliens who were (1) in the United States without an inspection, (2) inspected and not admitted, or (3) previously admitted but now subject to removal. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1225(b)(2), 1227(a). Special removal proceedings were established for two types of individuals arriving in the United States: those who are (1) suspected of being terrorists or a security threat, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1225(c), or (2) stowaways, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1225(a)(2). Congress established expedited removal proceedings for arriving non-citizens who are charged as inadmissible due to lack of proper documents or material misrepresentations at entry. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1225(b)(1). Expedited removal proceedings provide little opportunity for relief; however, aliens in this situation can seek asylum. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1225(b)(1)(A). If the alien alleges a credible fear based on one of the statutory grounds, she receives an interview with an asylum pre-screening officer. If the officer finds that she has alleged facts sufficient to justify a credible fear, then the alien will be referred to an immigration judge. 8 C.F.R. &#167; 235.3(b)(4); 8 C.F.R. &#167; 235.6(a)(1)(ii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The last type of proceeding is the standard removal proceeding for persons present in the United States, regardless of whether they are applicants for admission or have been living in the United States previously. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1225(b)(2); 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a.

Before 1960, adjustment of status in the United States was only available to non-citizens legally in the country. <i>See</i> Immigration and Nationality Act, Pub.L. No. 414, 66 Stat. 217 (1952)(INA). Any immigrant present in the United States who was eligible for adjustment of status, but who was no longer in valid immigration status, had to obtain an immigrant visa at a United States post abroad in order to obtain permanent resident status. <i>See</i> S.Rep. No. 86-1651 (1960), <i>reprinted in</i> 1960 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3124, 3136. To process the immigrant visa at the consular post abroad, an immigrant residing in the United States had to apply to the INS for preexamination and voluntary departure in order to insure that he would be able to be readmitted into the country once he obtained the immigrant visa. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1960, Congress established the current procedure for adjustment of status to obviate the need for departure and reentry for aliens temporarily in the United States.

Congress has set forth the conditions for parole in the statute. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(d)(5)(A). Congress authorizes the Attorney General to allow parole \"temporarily under such conditions as he may prescribe only on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(d)(5)(A). Accordingly, the Attorney General has promulgated regulations. 8 C.F.R. &#167; 212.5. Under the regulations, aliens in one of five groups can be paroled for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit \"provided the aliens present neither a security risk nor a risk of absconding.\" 8 C.F.R. &#167; 212.5(b). These five groups are: (1) aliens with a serious medical condition, (2) women who have been medically certified as pregnant, (3) aliens who are defined as juveniles in certain circumstances, (4) aliens who will be witnesses in judicial proceedings, and (5) aliens whose continued detention is not in the public interest as determined by the officials charged with exercising this discretion. 8 C.F.R. &#167; 212.5(b)(1)-(5). In making their decisions, immigration officers can consider whether the alien has \"[c]ommunity ties\" such as close relatives with known addresses. 8 C.F.R. &#167; 212.5(d)(2). Arriving aliens who claim asylum and establish a credible fear with an asylum pre-screening officer can be paroled at the point of entry while they pursue their asylum application.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A paroled individual is not considered \"admitted\" into the United States: he is an \"applicant for admission.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(13)(B).

However, \"when the purposes of such parole ... have been served the alien shall forthwith return or be returned to the custody from which he was paroled and thereafter his case shall continue to be dealt with in the same manner as that of any other applicant for admission to the United States.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(d)(5)(A). It appears from the face of the statute that the Attorney General has no discretion in this determination. As soon as the reasons for parole have been served, the individual must be returned to custody.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By statute, paroled individuals<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> are eligible for adjustment of status if they meet the other statutory eligibility requirements. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(a). Section 1255 makes no distinction between those who are in removal proceedings and those who are not for purposes of adjustment of status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the 1960 enactment of section 1255(a), Congress has on several occasions amended other provisions of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255 to restrict the class of people who are eligible to receive adjustment of status. For example, alien crewmen, aliens continuing or accepting unauthorized employment, and aliens admitted in transit without a visa are not eligible to adjust status under section 1255(a), unless they fall into limited exceptions to the bar on eligibility. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(c). Congress also limited the ability of an alien to adjust status if the alien is married in the United States while in judicial proceedings. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(e)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Significantly, Congress has never taken parolees, as a group, out of the class of eligible aliens, despite over a dozen opportunities &#8212; where section 1255 was otherwise amended &#8212; to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Parolees, although they are physically present in the United States, are treated as if they were at the border seeking admission. Before the 1996 IIRIRA statutory changes, parolees were subject to exclusion proceedings. Post-IIRIRA, individuals who are paroled and are seeking asylum are subject to removal proceedings. As arriving aliens, parolees are subject to removal proceedings. \"[I]f the examining officer determines that an alien seeking admission is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted, the alien shall be detained for a [removal] proceeding....\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1225(b)(2)(A). Parolees are generally not \"clearly and beyond a doubt\" entitled to admission. However, as parolees, they are not in detention. Until the final order of removal, which in some circumstances &#8212; such as where the applicant is applying for asylum &#8212; can take years, paroled aliens in removal proceedings, such as Succar, live, work and form relationships within the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>D.

Dec. 379, 379-80, 1996 WL 379828 (BIA 1996). The BIA held that in exclusion proceedings, jurisdiction over an alien's application for adjustment of status lay with the district director of the immigration agency, not the IJ. <i>Id.</i> at 379. The Board explained, \"[A]pplicants [in exclusion proceedings] can file their adjustment application with the district director of the [INS], who has sole jurisdiction over the application and can act on the application independently of these [exclusion] proceedings.\" <i>Id.</i> at 380.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Historically, the district director had jurisdiction over the adjustment application of both aliens in deportation proceedings who were admitted and aliens in exclusion proceedings who were paroled.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> <i>In re Manneh,</i> 16 I. &amp; N. Dec. 272, 274, 1977 WL 39268 (BIA 1977). In 1961, regulations gave the IJ the authority in deportation cases to renew admitted aliens' adjustment applications that were denied by the district director and to adjudicate initial applications for such aliens in deportation proceedings. <i>Id.</i> With this change, the district director no longer had authority over adjustment applications once deportation proceedings began. <i>Id.</i> However, the Board determined that this enlarged jurisdiction did not apply when the alien was in exclusion proceedings: the district director retained sole authority for adjustment of status applications. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1997, the Attorney General<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> promulgated new regulations, which were said to implement IIRIRA. The regulations created a new definition for the term arriving alien:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The term arriving alien means an applicant for admission coming or attempting to come into the United States at a port of entry, or an alien seeking transit through the United States at a port-of-entry, or an alien interdicted in international or United States waters and brought into the United States by any means, whether or not to a designated port-of-entry, and regardless of the means of transport. An arriving alien remains such even if paroled pursuant to section 212(d)(5) of the Act....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">8 C.F.R. &#167; 1.1(q).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Armed with this new definition of arriving alien, the Attorney General made a substantive change to the adjustment of status regulations. The Attorney General made several categories of aliens ineligible to apply for adjustment of status under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(a), including \"<i>[a]ny arriving alien who is in removal proceedings</i> pursuant to section 235(b)(1) or section 240 of the Act.\" 8 C.F.R. &#167; 245.1(c)(8) (emphasis added). It is this particular provision of the regulation that is challenged before this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Attorney General also enacted regulations regarding the proper place for an eligible individual to file for adjustment of status. A key regulation states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An alien [who believes he or she is eligible for adjustment of status] shall apply to the director having jurisdiction over his or her place of residence.... After an alien, <i>other than an arriving alien,</i> is in deportation or removal proceedings, his or her application for adjustment of status... shall be made and considered only in those proceedings.... An arriving alien, <i>other than an alien in removal proceedings,</i> who believes he or she meets the eligibility requirements..., shall apply to the director having jurisdiction over his or her place of arrival.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">8 C.F.R. &#167; 245.2(a)(1) (emphasis added). A parolee in removal proceedings thus no longer has the ability to apply before anyone, either the district director or the IJ, for adjustment of status. By contrast, a parolee who is not in removal proceedings (as an arriving alien) can, consistent with earlier practice, apply to the district director for adjustment of status. We are informed that most arriving alien parolees are placed in removal proceedings. The new regulatory scheme is, thus, a break from earlier practice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In promulgating 8 C.F.R. &#167; 245.1(c)(8) in 1997, the Attorney General explained the rationale for the new regulation:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consistent with Congress' intent that arriving aliens ... be removed in an expedited manner through the procedures provided..., the Attorney General has determined that she will not favorably exercise her discretion to adjust the status of arriving aliens who are ordered removed....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">62 Fed.Reg. 444, 452 (January 3, 1997). In an effort to quickly remove aliens, the regulation aimed to eliminate avenues available to arriving aliens in removal proceedings that allow such aliens to \"delay their removal through an application for adjustment of status.\" <i>Id.</i> The Attorney General explained that an arriving alien will not be able to adjust status within the United States. If an arriving alien is eligible for an immigrant visa, she will be \"required to return to ... her country of residence and request it through the consular process available to all aliens outside of the United States.\" <i>Id.</i> The Attorney General believed that if \"the Service decides as a matter of prosecutorial discretion, not to initiate removal proceedings but to parole the arriving alien, the alien will be able to apply for adjustment of status before the district director.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the new regulations, arriving aliens in removal proceedings (regardless of whether they otherwise meet the statutory criteria for adjustment of status) must leave the United States and go through consular processing in order to adjust status; the respondent has represented that this is the only option available to them. But there are significant limitations even as to this avenue. Non-citizens are subject to 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(a)(9)(B)(i), which bars non-citizens from reentry into the United States for three years if they were unlawfully present in the United States for more than 180 days but less than one year and for ten years if they were unlawfully present for more than one year.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> Any waiver of this statutory bar is in the absolute discretion of the Attorney General. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(a)(9)(B)(v). Also, non-citizens who have not been admitted into the United States are ineligible for voluntary departure. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229c(a)(4). Following any involuntary removal, they will be ineligible for readmission for five years unless the Attorney General grants a waiver. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(a)(9)(A)(i), (iii). Parolees have, by definition, not been admitted, and thus will generally be subject to this five year bar for involuntary removal as well. Denying paroled aliens in removal proceedings the ability to adjust status within the United States thus creates a significant hardship on these individuals and their families.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, as the Attorney General has stated, the immigration agency in theory can decide to terminate the removal proceedings in the alien's favor, which would allow the arriving alien &#8212; who would then not be in removal proceedings &#8212; to apply for adjustment of status before the district director. The government as prosecutor in the removal proceedings may, in its discretion, terminate the proceedings in order to permit the alien to apply for adjustment of status. But as this case demonstrates, the BIA has apparently taken the position that neither it nor the IJ may suspend or terminate the proceedings for this purpose without the government's consent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Availability of Judicial Review of Statutory Interpretation Claim</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Attorney General first argues that 8 U.S.C &#167; 1252(a)(2)(B) precludes judicial review of the Attorney General's denial of Succar's application for adjustment of status because the Attorney General, through the promulgation of 8 C.F.R. &#167; 245.1(c)(8), made a discretionary determination that arriving aliens do not merit adjustment of status under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255.

The Attorney General relies on &#167; 1252(a)(2)(B), which reads in part as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(B) Denials of discretionary relief</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no court shall have jurisdiction to review &#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section... 1255 of this title</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">8 U.S.C &#167; 1252(a)(2)(B)(i). Both the Supreme Court and this court have consistently rejected arguments that Congress has eliminated judicial review of the legal question of interpretation of the statute as to whether an alien is eligible for consideration of relief.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Succar challenges the Attorney General's regulation as being contrary to the statute; that is a classic issue for the court to decide. The issue presented is a purely legal question and as such is not within the jurisdictional bar of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(2)(B). That is the ruling of <i>Zadvydas v. Davis,</i> 533 U.S. 678, 688, 121 S.Ct. 2491, 150 L.Ed.2d 653 (2001), which exercised judicial review over a challenge to the extent of the Attorney General's authority to detain an alien indefinitely under the post-removal-period detention statute because the authority of the Attorney General to act is \"not a matter of discretion\" and is subject to judicial review. So here the challenge goes to the Attorney General's statutory authority and not his discretion. <i>See Subhan v.

The regulation affects certain arriving aliens who have been granted parole into the United States and have also been placed in removal proceedings. As explained above, before adoption of 8 C.F.R. &#167; 245.1(c)(8) in 1997, this category of aliens, if they met the other statutory requirements, could apply for adjustment of status with the local district director. The effect of 8 C.F.R. &#167; 245.1(c)(8) is to deny eligibility for relief under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255 to this category of aliens by precluding consideration of their applications either before the district director or before an IJ.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Succar and supporting amici<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> launch a three-fold attack on the regulation. First, they argue the regulation is flatly inconsistent with congressional intent as expressed in 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(a) and the legislative history. Alternatively, they argue there are two possible interpretations of the regulation which must be adopted to avoid a conflict between the regulation and the statute. Finally, they argue that the Attorney General has acted ultra vires. Succar argues that 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(a) expressly mentions persons in parole status (without restricting that status to those not in removal proceedings) as among those eligible to apply for adjustment of status, and therefore Congress intends for any decision made within the Attorney General's admitted discretion to be made on an individualized basis after an eligible alien applies, not as a categorical eligibility exclusion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Attorney General defends the regulation, arguing that 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(a) expressly states that the decision to grant adjustment of status is subject to the Attorney General's discretion and that the regulation is no more than a valid exercise of that discretion. The Attorney General points out that the regulation does not make all of those in parole status ineligible to apply for adjustment of status, only those who have been placed in removal proceedings. However, it was represented in the briefs before this court that the \"majority of the intended beneficiaries of parolee adjustment of status are in removal proceedings.\" The Attorney General does not dispute this statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Paroled individuals must be placed in removal proceedings \"if the examining immigration officer determines that an alien seeking admission is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1225(b)(2)(A). The Attorney General argues that the challenged regulation does not effectuate a final exclusion from eligibility because even though these individuals cannot apply while they are physically in the United States, the alien can leave the United States and then apply for an immigrant visa at the embassy or consular office in his home country.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner responds that the result of such a requirement, contrary to congressional intent, is that many aliens would be barred from even applying from outside the country for long periods of time because of the statutory bars discussed above. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(a)(9).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> As we shall see, in enacting section 1255(a) in 1960, Congress expressed an intent that eligible aliens be able to adjust status without having to leave the United States, to relieve the burden on the United States citizen with whom the aliens had the requisite family or other relationship, on the United States consulates abroad, and on the alien. That was one of the primary purposes of the legislation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Attorney General also argues that the passage of IIRIRA, Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (1996), altered the immigration laws in many restrictive ways. Petitioner counters that IIRIRA did indeed tighten restrictions, but points out that application for adjustment of status by parolees was one of the few areas untouched. This, the petitioner says, reflected Congress's consistent understanding that the immigration agency would consider applications for adjustment of status from parolees, whether in removal proceedings or not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>B.

When there is no challenge to whether Congress authorized the Attorney General to issue regulations, we are faced with only two questions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first ask whether \"Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.\" <i>Chevron USA, Inc. v.

Indeed, the Supreme Court has said that \"judicial deference to the Executive Branch is especially appropriate in the immigration context where officials `exercise especially sensitive political functions that implicate questions of foreign relations.'\" <i>INS v.

Statutory Ambiguity</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each party initially argues that the statute is unambiguous, in its favor. The Attorney General argues that the statute unambiguously grants him discretion to allow or deny adjustment of status to an alien. One way to exercise that discretion, the Attorney General argues, is to make certain categories of otherwise eligible aliens ineligible to apply and so ineligible to warrant the favorable exercise of the Attorney General's discretion. In the Attorney General's view, this is the end of the matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree that the statute gives the Attorney General discretion, but disagree that this ends the analysis as to whether the Attorney General can promulgate this particular categorical eligibility exclusion. The Supreme Court itself has ruled that the two questions of discretion as to the ultimate relief and discretion as to eligibility exclusions are distinct. <i>See Cardoza-Fonseca,</i> 480 U.S. at 443-44, 107 S.Ct. 1207 (distinguishing between the discretion in the Attorney General as to the ultimate decision to grant relief and the underlying process and criteria for eligibility for relief); <i>see also Goncalves,</i> 144 F.3d at 125 (\"Analytically, the decision whether an alien is eligible to be considered for a particular discretionary form of relief is a statutory question separate from the discretionary component of the administrative decision whether to grant relief.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute, we find, is unambiguous on this issue and that congressional clarity works against the Attorney General. We reject the respondent's argument that Congress authorized 8 C.F.R. &#167; 245.1(c)(8), making parolees in removal proceedings ineligible to adjust status, either by \"express delegation or the introduction of an interpretive gap.\" <i>Pauley v. BethEnergy Mines, Inc.,</i> 501 U.S. 680, 696, 111 S.Ct. 2524, 115 L.Ed.2d 604 (1991). Congress has spoken clearly on the issue of eligibility for adjustment of status and has reserved for itself the determination of whether a non-citizen should be able to apply for this relief. The Attorney General cannot promulgate a regulation that categorically excludes from application for adjustment of status a category of otherwise eligible aliens; this is contrary to congressional intent in section 1255.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>1.

By statute, two categories of aliens are eligible to apply. First is an alien who was inspected and admitted. Second is an alien who was paroled. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(a). The Attorney General's regulation carves out an exception from this second category of eligible aliens, by making paroled aliens who are placed in removal proceedings ineligible for adjustment of status relief, even if they otherwise meet the statutory requirements. 8 C.F.R. &#167; 245.1(c)(8).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress unambiguously reserved to itself the determination of who is eligible to apply for adjustment of status relief. 8 C.F.R. &#167; 245.1(c)(8) conflicts with the statute in several ways.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Congress itself explicitly determined categories of aliens (those aliens who had been \"inspected and admitted or paroled\") who are eligible for adjustment of status if they otherwise meet the statutory requirements. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(a). Despite numerous amendments to 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255 since 1960, Congress has not limited the eligibility of paroled aliens under section 1255(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> The statute has never stated that an alien is ineligible to adjust status if he is in removal proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, when Congress desired to limit the ability of a non-citizen who might otherwise have been eligible to apply for adjustment of status under 1255(a), it has done so explicitly by defining several categories of aliens as not eligible to apply. For example, alien crewmen, aliens continuing or accepting unauthorized employment, and aliens admitted in transit without a visa are not eligible to adjust status under section 1255(a) unless they fall into limited exceptions. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(c) (\"[S]ubsection (a) [of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255] <i>shall not be applicable to</i>....\")(emphasis added). Another category of aliens that Congress has explicitly determined is ineligible to apply for relief under section 1255(a) is the alien who is seeking to obtain an immigrant visa based on a marriage entered into while judicial proceedings are pending regarding the alien's right to be admitted or remain in the United States. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(e).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> The statute is clear that even if these individuals were \"inspected and admitted or paroled\" and complied with the other statutory requirements, they are not eligible to apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two themes. First, Congress explicitly rendered ineligible a certain category of aliens to apply. Second, that category of excluded aliens included <i>some</i> in removal proceedings, but Congress chose not to disqualify from eligibility all of those aliens \"inspected and admitted or paroled\" in removal or other judicial proceedings. In those limited circumstances when the involvement in proceedings works to hamper an individual's ability to adjust status, Congress has explicitly said so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, Congress also has determined that some aliens whom it has deemed ineligible under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(c) might in some limited circumstances still be eligible for adjustment of status relief. For example, in 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(i), Congress allows adjustment of status for certain aliens who entered the United States without inspection or who are categorized in section 1255(c) of the statute as being ineligible. Congress states that if these aliens are beneficiaries of either \"(i) a petition for classification under [8 U.S.C. &#167;] 1154 ... that was filed with the Attorney General on or before April 30, 2001; or (ii) an application for a labor certification under [8 U.S.C. &#167;] 1182(a)(5)(A) ... that was filed ... on or before such date,\" then they \"may apply to the Attorney General for adjustment of ... status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.\" <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(i).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a> When Congress has wanted to impose special restrictions on the applications for certain categories of aliens that it has deemed eligible, or conversely to open up eligibility for aliens that were ineligible, it has done so explicitly. But Congress has imposed no restrictions on applying for adjustment of status for a paroled alien based on that alien's being in removal proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>2. Context of the Statutory Scheme</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The terms and provisions of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(a) must be understood in the larger context of the statutory scheme. The immigration laws about adjustment of status are not a haphazard compilation of provisions; they are a calibrated set of rules that govern an area of national importance. Congress in many instances has specifically determined when to give discretion to the Attorney General and when to make its own policy choices. Viewing the statutory scheme in this manner clarifies two things: first, that the exclusion of parolees in removal proceedings renders ineligible most of the class that Congress rendered eligible by including parolees (for Congress clearly stated that most parolees would be in removal proceedings), and second, that the congressional choice to delegate to the Attorney General some circumscribed discretion over the ultimate decision of who is granted adjustment of status<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a> is not authorization for discretion in other areas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We explain: one policy choice Congress made was to allow (in some instances) aliens who were otherwise inadmissible on arrival the opportunity to seek adjustment of status relief if they met certain statutory criteria. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255. In 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182, Congress defines the classes of aliens who are ineligible for visas or admission to the United States and makes various exceptions from these blanket rules. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(a). Congress also allows for parole of these inadmissible aliens for \"urgent humanitarian reasons\" or \"significant public benefit.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(d)(5)(A). Congress specifically says parolees are not considered admitted. <i>Id.</i> Despite their status as inadmissible, Congress has also made the policy determination that these paroled aliens should be eligible to apply for adjustment of status, which essentially can act as an admission. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1182 is integral to determinations made in \"inspection,\" which is provided for in 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1225. All arriving aliens and aliens who are present in the United States without an inspection are \"applicants for admission,\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1225(a)(1), and they \"<i>shall</i> be inspected.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1225(a)(3) (emphasis added). Section 1225(b) provides for the inspection of aliens arriving in the United States and certain other aliens who have not been admitted or paroled. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1225(b). If aliens being inspected are not \"clearly and beyond a doubt\" admissible, under section 1182, then they must be referred to removal proceedings. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1225(b)(2)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This context shows that Congress purposefully classified paroled individuals as \"inadmissible,\" and it also determined that they should generally be placed in removal proceedings. But Congress also explicitly allowed paroled individuals to adjust status if they meet the other statutory requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the larger statutory scheme makes clear that in the context of adjustment of status, Congress is particular about where it grants \"discretion\" to the Attorney General. Congress has specified the conditions under which an arriving alien (including a paroled alien) is to be determined inadmissible and <i>must</i> be placed in removal proceedings. The determination as to placing an alien into removal is not a decision committed to agency discretion by Congress. Rather, Congress has defined the terms for initiating removal proceedings against arriving aliens in 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1225(b)(2)(A), which provides that,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[I]n the case of an alien who is an applicant for admission, if the examining immigration officer determines that an alien seeking admission is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted, the <i>alien shall be detained for a [removal proceeding].</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">8 U.S.C. &#167; 1225(b)(2)(A). Congress used the word \"shall\" to mandate that an immigration officer who cannot determine that the applicant for admission is clearly entitled to be admitted has no choice but to place the alien in removal proceedings. After the alien is placed in removal, the Attorney General may parole the alien into the United States in some instances,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a> but the alien still must go through removal proceedings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The incorrectness of the Attorney General's argument can be seen by looking at one of its logical implications. The Attorney General is also given discretion as to the ultimate decision in determining whether to grant asylum to aliens who are eligible for this relief. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1158(a); <i>Cardoza-Fonseca,</i> 480 U.S. at 443-44, 107 S.Ct. 1207.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a> If this grant of discretion meant what the government argues here, it would be logical that the Attorney General could similarly decline to allow asylum by issuing a regulation that refused to process applications from categories of asylum applicants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But that is not so. If the asylum applicant meets the eligibility requirements &#8212; if, in other words, the Attorney General determines that an applicant for asylum establishes she has \"a well founded fear of persecution\" on account of one of the statutory grounds &#8212; the alien must be allowed to apply.

Similarly, if the paroled adjustment of status applicant meets the eligibility requirements, the Attorney General may exercise his discretion only in the decision whether to grant permanent resident status. In both asylum and adjustment of status, an alien who satisfies the eligibility requirements to apply \"does not have a right to the [relief],\" but he is \"eligible\" to apply for it. <i>Cardoza-Fonseca,</i> 480 U.S. at 443-44, 107 S.Ct. 1207 (emphasis removed).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the regulation, 8 C.F.R. &#167; 245.1(c)(8), denying adjustment of status to parolees in removal proceedings is itself framed in terms of who is eligible to apply, the Attorney General argues the regulation is simply a determination at the outset that of the eligible parolees, the Attorney General will not exercise its discretion favorably to those who are in removal proceedings. The Attorney General relies on <i>Lopez v. Davis,</i> 531 U.S. 230, 121 S.Ct. 714, 148 L.Ed.2d 635 (2001), for the proposition that categorically excluding otherwise eligible individuals is an appropriate use of his discretion as to the ultimate decision granted in 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Lopez</i> is distinguishable. In <i>Lopez,</i> the Supreme Court upheld a regulation of the Bureau of Prisons (BOP), 28 C.F.R. &#167; 550.58(a)(1)(vi)(B), which categorically denied early release to prisoners whose current offense was a drug felony involving the carrying, possession, or use of a firearm. <i>See Lopez,</i> 531 U.S. at 233, 121 S.Ct. 714. The relevant statute states, \"The period a prisoner convicted of a nonviolent offense remains in custody after successfully completing a treatment program may be reduced by the [BOP], but such reduction may not be more than one year from the term the prisoner must otherwise serve.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3621(e)(2)(B). The Supreme Court framed the question as whether \"the Bureau has discretion to delineate, as an additional category of ineligible inmates, those whose current offense is a felony involving a firearm.\" <i>Lopez,</i> 531 U.S. at 238, 121 S.Ct. 714. The Court answered this question in the affirmative, agreeing with the BOP that \"Congress simply did not address how the Bureau should exercise its discretion within the class of inmates who satisfy the statutory prerequisites for early release.\" <i>Id.</i> at 239-40, 121 S.Ct. 714 (internal quotation marks omitted).

The statutory immigration scheme also constrains the Attorney General's discretion in several ways, including mandating when an arriving alien must be placed in removal proceedings, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1225(b)(2)(A), limiting the discretion of the Attorney General to parole aliens, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(d)(5), and denying the Attorney General the ultimate discretion to adjust the status of some otherwise eligible aliens, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(f). <i>Lopez</i> is a <i>Chevron</i> step two case because of congressional silence; our case, however, is a <i>Chevron</i> step one case because Congress has clearly spoken on the issue of eligibility.

By adopting the 1960 legislation, Congress wished to alleviate this burden on itself. <i>See id.</i> at 3136. There is some evidence in the legislative history that Congress wished also to alleviate the burden imposed on consular offices to process applications for adjustment of status.

It forces paroled aliens in removal proceedings to leave the country to apply for adjustment of status. This imposes considerable burdens on the aliens and, where applicable, their American spouses and relatives. The effect of the regulation, predictably, will be to increase the number of private bills seeking individual adjustment of status, thus burdening Congress. It will also increase the burden on consular offices abroad, because aliens who are otherwise available to adjust status will now have to apply through the consular office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 1960 legislative history of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(a) confirms and enhances our understanding of the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>E. Effect of IIRIRA</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We consider briefly the arguments of both sides that rely on later revisions to the INA, specifically IIRIRA, to support their different understandings of what Congress meant in the adjustment of status provisions of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255. There is no claim that section 1255(a) was amended by IIRIRA or any other statute in any relevant way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Attorney General relies on provisions of IIRIRA to argue that the original understanding of the statute in 1960 must be altered in light of later law, and the statute must now be read as introducing at least ambiguity into section 1255(a), despite the fact that section 1255(a) itself was not amended. The Attorney General argues that new regulations were required due to IIRIRA's replacement of \"entry\" with \"admission\" as the criterion which determines which of two sets of grounds of removal, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1882(a) or 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227, applies in removal proceedings. Further, the Attorney General argues, under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(d)(5)(A), a parole of an alien is not the admission of that alien.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our earlier analysis of the meaning of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(a) in light of the statutory context takes into account the statutory scheme as it exists under IIRIRA. The Attorney General's arguments do not change this understanding; they are unpersuasive because they do not concern the eligibility of paroled aliens to apply for adjustment of status under section 1255(a) or in any way act to limit the eligibility of paroled individuals &#8212; a group Congress specifically deemed eligible &#8212; to adjust status. The classification of paroled aliens as \"not admitted\" is not new to the passage of IIRIRA and does not change the treatment of parolees. Also, the reclassification of aliens \"present pursuant to an entry\" to \"applicants for admission\" does not affect the status of paroled aliens, who have always been considered applicants for admission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner relies on IIRIRA for two points. Specifically, the petitioner argues that since 1960 the agency and Congress have consistently understood the statute to be as petitioner reads it. Moreover, in the major revisions of the immigration laws since 1960, which largely restricted aliens' efforts to remain in this country, Congress has never once restricted the ability of paroled aliens to apply for adjustment of status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This confirms our understanding of the clear meaning of the statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fn35_ref\">35</a> Consistent with our interpretation of the statute, in our view, the changes to the statute with the passage of IIRIRA work against the Attorney General's argument, not in favor of it. Under IIRIRA and previous amendments, Congress amended section 1255 to limit the eligibility for adjustment of status so that certain types of aliens may not apply. Historical &amp; Statutory Notes, 1996 Amendments, 8 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1255. Congress has directly addressed the issue of eligibility for adjustment of status on several occasions, yet these amendments did not limit the category of paroled aliens who may apply for adjustment of status, and they neither gave the Attorney General discretion to redefine eligibility nor did they endorse the additional restrictions on eligibility contained in the Attorney General's regulation. <i>See Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco, Corp.,</i> 529 U.S. at 137, 120 S.Ct. 1291 (relying in part on later actions of Congress which specifically address the regulation of tobacco as evidence that the FDA did not have authority to regulate tobacco).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>F.

The desire for administrative efficiency cannot displace clear congressional intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also, the Attorney General argues he has a facially legitimate and bona fide reason for the regulation, citing to the Immigration Control and Financial Responsibility Act of 1996,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fn36_ref\">36</a> which was intended to \"increase control over immigration ... expediting the removal of excludable and deportable aliens, especially criminal aliens, and reducing the abuse of parole and asylum provisions.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn37\" id=\"fn37_ref\">37</a> S.Rep. No. 104-249 at 2 (1994) (not reported in U.S.C.C.A.N.). The short reply is that Congress did not, even in 1996, give the Attorney General unfettered discretion to expedite removal and reduce abuse of parole in disregard of the statutory scheme. Congress expressly did not alter the basic structure of eligibility for application for adjustment of status while simultaneously making a limited category of parolees ineligible. <i>See Cardoza-Fonseca,</i> 480 U.S. at 444-45, 107 S.Ct. 1207 (noting the agency cannot ignore Congress's desired scheme in the asylum area).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p131\">\n      <span class=\"num\">131</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the position that the Attorney General takes in the 1997 regulation is inconsistent with the agency's long-standing previous practice. Arriving aliens in removal proceedings were always able to adjust status before the district director prior to the promulgation of the 1997 regulations. <i>See In re Castro-Padron,</i> 21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 379, 1996 WL 379828 (BIA 1996). As noted in <i>Cardoza-Fonseca,</i>\"An additional reason for rejecting the [Attorney General's] request for heightened deference to [his] position is the inconsistency of the positions the [agency] has taken through the years. An agency interpretation of a relevant provision which conflicts with the agency's earlier interpretation is `entitled to considerably less deference' than a consistently held agency view.\" <i>Cardoza-Fonseca,</i> 480 U.S. at 446 n. 30, 107 S.Ct. 1207 (quoting <i>Watt v.

By contrast, if an individual demonstrates the lesser well-founded fear standard to be statutorily eligible for asylum, the relief was not automatic; it was then up to the Attorney General to exercise his discretion as to whether to grant the requested relief. <i>Id.</i> at 443-44, 107 S.Ct. 1207.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn27\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27_ref\">27</a>\n        <p> It is worth noting that the asylum statute as in force at the time it was interpreted in<i>Cardoza-Fonseca,</i> is similar in wording to the adjustment of status statute.

The regulation redefines certain aliens as ineligible to apply for adjustment of status to lawful permanent residents whom a statute, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(a), defines as eligible to apply. Under that regulation, the Attorney General will not consider an application for adjustment of status from the entire category of aliens who have been granted parole status but have been placed in removal proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The essence of the Attorney General's argument is that since he has been given ultimate discretion to deny adjustment of status after application, the validity of the regulation is itself not subject to judicial review, and, if it were, the regulation must be upheld as a permissible exercise of that ultimate discretion. We disagree on both points. We hold that there is no statutory bar to review and that the regulation is contrary to the language and intent of the statute, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(a). As a result, we vacate the order removing Wissam Succar from the United States and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our reasons, which we explain in more depth below, are as follows. The mere fact that a statute gives the Attorney General discretion as to whether to grant relief after application does not by itself give the Attorney General the discretion to define eligibility for such relief. That is clear from <i>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111838\"><a href=\"/opinion/111838/ins-v-cardoza-fonseca/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">421</span></a></span>, 443, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111838\"><a href=\"/opinion/111838/ins-v-cardoza-fonseca/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">434</span></a></span> (1987). Courts must still interpret the statute. Where the statute is silent on eligibility, the agency involved may reasonably choose to exercise its discretion to withhold relief by excluding certain persons from eligibility for such relief. <i>Lopez v. Davis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118400\"><a href=\"/opinion/118400/lopez-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">230</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118400\"><a href=\"/opinion/118400/lopez-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

That lack of a carve out for parolees in removal proceedings is itself significant, given that the statute contains a number of carve outs as to eligibility for adjustment of status. Some carve outs exclude persons from eligibility to apply who would otherwise meet more general eligibility requirements. Further, other carve outs create eligibility in persons otherwise ineligible. Congress thus has created a comprehensive scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewing the larger statutory context, we find Congress has also been explicit about where the Attorney General has been granted discretion and where he has not. By contrast with other areas, there is no explicit grant of discretion to redefine eligibility to apply for adjustment of status of parolees to exclude those in removal proceedings. Congress did not place the decision as to which applicants for admission are placed in removal proceedings into the discretion of the Attorney General, but created mandatory criteria. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1225(b)(1), (2). In addition, persons cannot be granted paroled status at all if they pose a security risk; they are to be ordered removed and this order must be reported to the Attorney General. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(c)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statutory scheme reflects Congress's careful balancing of the country's security needs against the national interests Congress wished to advance through adjustment of status proceedings. The regulation upsets the balance Congress created.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Checking our construction of the statute against the legislative history of section 1255, we find the regulation to be inconsistent with the intent expressed in the statute. In 1960, when Congress included paroled aliens as aliens who are eligible for adjustment of status relief through section 1255, it did so to solve certain problems, which we describe later. The effect of the regulation is to re-institute the problems Congress wished to solve. Further, until the 1997 promulgation of the regulation, the Attorney General had consistently interpreted section 1255 in a manner consistent with the statute and the legislative history and inconsistent with the 1997 regulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to the Attorney General's argument that the 1996 enactment of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) justifies the 1997 regulation, we note the Attorney General's concession that IIRIRA, which altered so much of the immigration laws, left untouched the language of section 1255, as enacted in 1960, on the matter in question. That being so, the relevance of the Attorney General's remaining arguments, largely based on general policy said to be embodied in IIRIRA, is doubtful. To the contrary, IIRIRA tends to strengthen, not weaken, the petitioner's claim that the regulation is invalid. Finally, the purported policy justifications of expediting removal of aliens and administrative ease must give way to clear congressional intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wissam Succar is a native and citizen of Lebanon. Succar arrived at Miami International Airport on October 21, 1998, when his flight from Lebanon to Panama stopped in the United States.

Because Succar did not have the proper documentation for admission, he was taken into government custody and held at the Krome detention facility in Miami, Florida. An asylum pre-screening officer met with Succar on November 19, 1998, and determined that he had a credible fear of persecution based on his involvement with the Christian militias in Lebanon. The officer found that the facts as recounted by Succar could establish his eligibility for asylum and a credible fear of harm on the basis of an imputed political opinion. Succar was placed into removal proceedings and was subsequently paroled into the United States on November 30, 1998. Succar has remained in parole status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over one year later, on January 19, 2000, Succar admitted the allegations in the Notice to Appear and conceded removability; he renewed his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. On March 1, 2000, a hearing was held on his asylum application and the trial was set for April 18, 2000. On April 18, after a hearing on the merits of his application, the Immigration Judge (IJ) denied Succar's request for asylum and withholding of removal. Succar appealed this decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 19, 2001, while his appeal was pending before the BIA and while he was paroled into the United States, Succar married a United States citizen. Succar's wife filed an immigrant visa petition for him, and the petition was approved on April 26, 2001. The approval form directed Succar to contact the local INS office to obtain Form I-485, the application for adjustment of status to a permanent resident. Believing that he met the statutory eligibility requirements for adjustment of status, on October 17, 2001, Succar filed a motion with the BIA to remand the proceedings to the IJ for consideration of his application for adjustment of status under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(a). This motion was unopposed by the INS.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The BIA granted the motion on December 18, 2001 and remanded the case to the IJ for further proceedings. The remand proved to be fruitless for the INS soon took the position that under 8 C.F.R. &#167; 245.1,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Succar was ineligible to apply for adjustment of status either before the IJ in the removal proceedings or, separately, before the Immigration Service's district director.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a July 29, 2002 hearing, Succar submitted his adjustment of status application to the IJ. In the middle of the hearing, the IJ stated that based on 8 C.F.R. &#167; 245.1, \"I am confident that I don't have the authority to adjust status to someone who's an arriving alien.\" The IJ denied the adjustment of status application as a matter of law, and then continued, \"The Immigration Service doesn't have the authority to adjust his status unless they are willing to terminate this case with me and if that be the case, I'll happily do it but I don't have the authority to terminate....\" In his oral decision of the same day, the IJ stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The respondent is an arriving alien and, therefore, he is not eligible to adjust status before the Immigration Judge. Additionally the respondent is not eligible to adjust status before the District Director of the Immigration Service in that he is in [removal] proceedings. As I indicated to both counsel, if the Immigration Service wished to have me terminate these proceedings or even to conditionally terminate them, I would have done so in order to afford the Immigration Service an opportunity to see whether an adjustment of status ought to be granted. However, that was not agreed to by the Immigration Service counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The regulations provide under 8 C.F.R.

Among many other changes, Congress eliminated the definition of the term \"entry\" and replaced it with the terms \"admission\" and \"admitted.\" <i>See</i> IIRIRA, Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-575 (1996). Admission and admitted now include only \"the <i>lawful</i> entry of the alien into the United States after inspection and authorization by an immigration officer.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(13)(A)(emphasis added). The main impact of this change is to re-characterize aliens who are present in the United States, but who have not been inspected and admitted. They are now considered \"applicants for admission\" along with other arriving aliens. The statute requires that all aliens who are seeking admission or readmission to the United States be inspected by immigration officers, prior to a determination of their status. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1225(a)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress also eliminated deportation and exclusion proceedings and replaced them with removal proceedings, which were applicable to all aliens who were (1) in the United States without an inspection, (2) inspected and not admitted, or (3) previously admitted but now subject to removal. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1225(b)(2), 1227(a). Special removal proceedings were established for two types of individuals arriving in the United States: those who are (1) suspected of being terrorists or a security threat, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1225(c), or (2) stowaways, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1225(a)(2). Congress established expedited removal proceedings for arriving non-citizens who are charged as inadmissible due to lack of proper documents or material misrepresentations at entry. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1225(b)(1). Expedited removal proceedings provide little opportunity for relief; however, aliens in this situation can seek asylum. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1225(b)(1)(A). If the alien alleges a credible fear based on one of the statutory grounds, she receives an interview with an asylum pre-screening officer. If the officer finds that she has alleged facts sufficient to justify a credible fear, then the alien will be referred to an immigration judge. 8 C.F.R. &#167; 235.3(b)(4); 8 C.F.R. &#167; 235.6(a)(1)(ii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The last type of proceeding is the standard removal proceeding for persons present in the United States, regardless of whether they are applicants for admission or have been living in the United States previously. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1225(b)(2); 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a.

Congress has set forth the conditions for parole in the statute. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(d)(5)(A). Congress authorizes the Attorney General to allow parole \"temporarily under such conditions as he may prescribe only on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(d)(5)(A). Accordingly, the Attorney General has promulgated regulations. 8 C.F.R. &#167; 212.5. Under the regulations, aliens in one of five groups can be paroled for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit \"provided the aliens present neither a security risk nor a risk of absconding.\" 8 C.F.R. &#167; 212.5(b). These five groups are: (1) aliens with a serious medical condition, (2) women who have been medically certified as pregnant, (3) aliens who are defined as juveniles in certain circumstances, (4) aliens who will be witnesses in judicial proceedings, and (5) aliens whose continued detention is not in the public interest as determined by the officials charged with exercising this discretion. 8 C.F.R. &#167; 212.5(b)(1)-(5). In making their decisions, immigration officers can consider whether the alien has \"[c]ommunity ties\" such as close relatives with known addresses. 8 C.F.R. &#167; 212.5(d)(2). Arriving aliens who claim asylum and establish a credible fear with an asylum pre-screening officer can be paroled at the point of entry while they pursue their asylum application.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A paroled individual is not considered \"admitted\" into the United States: he is an \"applicant for admission.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(13)(B).

However, \"when the purposes of such parole ... have been served the alien shall forthwith return or be returned to the custody from which he was paroled and thereafter his case shall continue to be dealt with in the same manner as that of any other applicant for admission to the United States.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(d)(5)(A). It appears from the face of the statute that the Attorney General has no discretion in this determination.

For example, alien crewmen, aliens continuing or accepting unauthorized employment, and aliens admitted in transit without a visa are not eligible to adjust status under section 1255(a), unless they fall into limited exceptions to the bar on eligibility. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(c). Congress also limited the ability of an alien to adjust status if the alien is married in the United States while in judicial proceedings. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(e)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Significantly, Congress has never taken parolees, as a group, out of the class of eligible aliens, despite over a dozen opportunities &#8212; where section 1255 was otherwise amended &#8212; to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Parolees, although they are physically present in the United States, are treated as if they were at the border seeking admission. Before the 1996 IIRIRA statutory changes, parolees were subject to exclusion proceedings. Post-IIRIRA, individuals who are paroled and are seeking asylum are subject to removal proceedings. As arriving aliens, parolees are subject to removal proceedings. \"[I]f the examining officer determines that an alien seeking admission is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted, the alien shall be detained for a [removal] proceeding....\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1225(b)(2)(A). Parolees are generally not \"clearly and beyond a doubt\" entitled to admission. However, as parolees, they are not in detention. Until the final order of removal, which in some circumstances &#8212; such as where the applicant is applying for asylum &#8212; can take years, paroled aliens in removal proceedings, such as Succar, live, work and form relationships within the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>D.

The BIA held that in exclusion proceedings, jurisdiction over an alien's application for adjustment of status lay with the district director of the immigration agency, not the IJ. <i>Id.</i> at 379. The Board explained, \"[A]pplicants [in exclusion proceedings] can file their adjustment application with the district director of the [INS], who has sole jurisdiction over the application and can act on the application independently of these [exclusion] proceedings.\" <i>Id.</i> at 380.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Historically, the district director had jurisdiction over the adjustment application of both aliens in deportation proceedings who were admitted and aliens in exclusion proceedings who were paroled.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> <i>In re Manneh,</i> 16 I. &amp; N.

In 1961, regulations gave the IJ the authority in deportation cases to renew admitted aliens' adjustment applications that were denied by the district director and to adjudicate initial applications for such aliens in deportation proceedings. <i>Id.</i> With this change, the district director no longer had authority over adjustment applications once deportation proceedings began. <i>Id.</i> However, the Board determined that this enlarged jurisdiction did not apply when the alien was in exclusion proceedings: the district director retained sole authority for adjustment of status applications. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1997, the Attorney General<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> promulgated new regulations, which were said to implement IIRIRA. The regulations created a new definition for the term arriving alien:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The term arriving alien means an applicant for admission coming or attempting to come into the United States at a port of entry, or an alien seeking transit through the United States at a port-of-entry, or an alien interdicted in international or United States waters and brought into the United States by any means, whether or not to a designated port-of-entry, and regardless of the means of transport. An arriving alien remains such even if paroled pursuant to section 212(d)(5) of the Act....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">8 C.F.R. &#167; 1.1(q).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Armed with this new definition of arriving alien, the Attorney General made a substantive change to the adjustment of status regulations. The Attorney General made several categories of aliens ineligible to apply for adjustment of status under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(a), including \"<i>[a]ny arriving alien who is in removal proceedings</i> pursuant to section 235(b)(1) or section 240 of the Act.\" 8 C.F.R. &#167; 245.1(c)(8) (emphasis added). It is this particular provision of the regulation that is challenged before this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Attorney General also enacted regulations regarding the proper place for an eligible individual to file for adjustment of status. A key regulation states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An alien [who believes he or she is eligible for adjustment of status] shall apply to the director having jurisdiction over his or her place of residence.... After an alien, <i>other than an arriving alien,</i> is in deportation or removal proceedings, his or her application for adjustment of status... shall be made and considered only in those proceedings.... An arriving alien, <i>other than an alien in removal proceedings,</i> who believes he or she meets the eligibility requirements..., shall apply to the director having jurisdiction over his or her place of arrival.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">8 C.F.R. &#167; 245.2(a)(1) (emphasis added). A parolee in removal proceedings thus no longer has the ability to apply before anyone, either the district director or the IJ, for adjustment of status. By contrast, a parolee who is not in removal proceedings (as an arriving alien) can, consistent with earlier practice, apply to the district director for adjustment of status. We are informed that most arriving alien parolees are placed in removal proceedings. The new regulatory scheme is, thus, a break from earlier practice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In promulgating 8 C.F.R. &#167; 245.1(c)(8) in 1997, the Attorney General explained the rationale for the new regulation:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consistent with Congress' intent that arriving aliens ... be removed in an expedited manner through the procedures provided..., the Attorney General has determined that she will not favorably exercise her discretion to adjust the status of arriving aliens who are ordered removed....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">62 Fed.Reg. 444, 452 (January 3, 1997). In an effort to quickly remove aliens, the regulation aimed to eliminate avenues available to arriving aliens in removal proceedings that allow such aliens to \"delay their removal through an application for adjustment of status.\" <i>Id.</i> The Attorney General explained that an arriving alien will not be able to adjust status within the United States. If an arriving alien is eligible for an immigrant visa, she will be \"required to return to ... her country of residence and request it through the consular process available to all aliens outside of the United States.\" <i>Id.</i> The Attorney General believed that if \"the Service decides as a matter of prosecutorial discretion, not to initiate removal proceedings but to parole the arriving alien, the alien will be able to apply for adjustment of status before the district director.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the new regulations, arriving aliens in removal proceedings (regardless of whether they otherwise meet the statutory criteria for adjustment of status) must leave the United States and go through consular processing in order to adjust status; the respondent has represented that this is the only option available to them. But there are significant limitations even as to this avenue. Non-citizens are subject to 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(a)(9)(B)(i), which bars non-citizens from reentry into the United States for three years if they were unlawfully present in the United States for more than 180 days but less than one year and for ten years if they were unlawfully present for more than one year.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> Any waiver of this statutory bar is in the absolute discretion of the Attorney General. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(a)(9)(B)(v). Also, non-citizens who have not been admitted into the United States are ineligible for voluntary departure. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229c(a)(4). Following any involuntary removal, they will be ineligible for readmission for five years unless the Attorney General grants a waiver. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(a)(9)(A)(i), (iii). Parolees have, by definition, not been admitted, and thus will generally be subject to this five year bar for involuntary removal as well. Denying paroled aliens in removal proceedings the ability to adjust status within the United States thus creates a significant hardship on these individuals and their families.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, as the Attorney General has stated, the immigration agency in theory can decide to terminate the removal proceedings in the alien's favor, which would allow the arriving alien &#8212; who would then not be in removal proceedings &#8212; to apply for adjustment of status before the district director. The government as prosecutor in the removal proceedings may, in its discretion, terminate the proceedings in order to permit the alien to apply for adjustment of status. But as this case demonstrates, the BIA has apparently taken the position that neither it nor the IJ may suspend or terminate the proceedings for this purpose without the government's consent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Availability of Judicial Review of Statutory Interpretation Claim</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Attorney General first argues that 8 U.S.C &#167; 1252(a)(2)(B) precludes judicial review of the Attorney General's denial of Succar's application for adjustment of status because the Attorney General, through the promulgation of 8 C.F.R. &#167; 245.1(c)(8), made a discretionary determination that arriving aliens do not merit adjustment of status under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255.

The regulation affects certain arriving aliens who have been granted parole into the United States and have also been placed in removal proceedings. As explained above, before adoption of 8 C.F.R. &#167; 245.1(c)(8) in 1997, this category of aliens, if they met the other statutory requirements, could apply for adjustment of status with the local district director. The effect of 8 C.F.R. &#167; 245.1(c)(8) is to deny eligibility for relief under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255 to this category of aliens by precluding consideration of their applications either before the district director or before an IJ.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Succar and supporting amici<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> launch a three-fold attack on the regulation. First, they argue the regulation is flatly inconsistent with congressional intent as expressed in 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(a) and the legislative history. Alternatively, they argue there are two possible interpretations of the regulation which must be adopted to avoid a conflict between the regulation and the statute. Finally, they argue that the Attorney General has acted ultra vires. Succar argues that 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(a) expressly mentions persons in parole status (without restricting that status to those not in removal proceedings) as among those eligible to apply for adjustment of status, and therefore Congress intends for any decision made within the Attorney General's admitted discretion to be made on an individualized basis after an eligible alien applies, not as a categorical eligibility exclusion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Attorney General defends the regulation, arguing that 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(a) expressly states that the decision to grant adjustment of status is subject to the Attorney General's discretion and that the regulation is no more than a valid exercise of that discretion. The Attorney General points out that the regulation does not make all of those in parole status ineligible to apply for adjustment of status, only those who have been placed in removal proceedings. However, it was represented in the briefs before this court that the \"majority of the intended beneficiaries of parolee adjustment of status are in removal proceedings.\" The Attorney General does not dispute this statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Paroled individuals must be placed in removal proceedings \"if the examining immigration officer determines that an alien seeking admission is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1225(b)(2)(A).

Petitioner counters that IIRIRA did indeed tighten restrictions, but points out that application for adjustment of status by parolees was one of the few areas untouched.

By statute, two categories of aliens are eligible to apply. First is an alien who was inspected and admitted. Second is an alien who was paroled. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(a). The Attorney General's regulation carves out an exception from this second category of eligible aliens, by making paroled aliens who are placed in removal proceedings ineligible for adjustment of status relief, even if they otherwise meet the statutory requirements. 8 C.F.R. &#167; 245.1(c)(8).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress unambiguously reserved to itself the determination of who is eligible to apply for adjustment of status relief. 8 C.F.R. &#167; 245.1(c)(8) conflicts with the statute in several ways.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Congress itself explicitly determined categories of aliens (those aliens who had been \"inspected and admitted or paroled\") who are eligible for adjustment of status if they otherwise meet the statutory requirements. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(a). Despite numerous amendments to 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255 since 1960, Congress has not limited the eligibility of paroled aliens under section 1255(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> The statute has never stated that an alien is ineligible to adjust status if he is in removal proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, when Congress desired to limit the ability of a non-citizen who might otherwise have been eligible to apply for adjustment of status under 1255(a), it has done so explicitly by defining several categories of aliens as not eligible to apply. For example, alien crewmen, aliens continuing or accepting unauthorized employment, and aliens admitted in transit without a visa are not eligible to adjust status under section 1255(a) unless they fall into limited exceptions. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(c) (\"[S]ubsection (a) [of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255] <i>shall not be applicable to</i>....\")(emphasis added). Another category of aliens that Congress has explicitly determined is ineligible to apply for relief under section 1255(a) is the alien who is seeking to obtain an immigrant visa based on a marriage entered into while judicial proceedings are pending regarding the alien's right to be admitted or remain in the United States. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(e).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> The statute is clear that even if these individuals were \"inspected and admitted or paroled\" and complied with the other statutory requirements, they are not eligible to apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two themes. First, Congress explicitly rendered ineligible a certain category of aliens to apply. Second, that category of excluded aliens included <i>some</i> in removal proceedings, but Congress chose not to disqualify from eligibility all of those aliens \"inspected and admitted or paroled\" in removal or other judicial proceedings. In those limited circumstances when the involvement in proceedings works to hamper an individual's ability to adjust status, Congress has explicitly said so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, Congress also has determined that some aliens whom it has deemed ineligible under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(c) might in some limited circumstances still be eligible for adjustment of status relief. For example, in 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(i), Congress allows adjustment of status for certain aliens who entered the United States without inspection or who are categorized in section 1255(c) of the statute as being ineligible. Congress states that if these aliens are beneficiaries of either \"(i) a petition for classification under [8 U.S.C. &#167;] 1154 ... that was filed with the Attorney General on or before April 30, 2001; or (ii) an application for a labor certification under [8 U.S.C. &#167;] 1182(a)(5)(A) ... that was filed ... on or before such date,\" then they \"may apply to the Attorney General for adjustment of ... status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.\" <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(i).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a> When Congress has wanted to impose special restrictions on the applications for certain categories of aliens that it has deemed eligible, or conversely to open up eligibility for aliens that were ineligible, it has done so explicitly. But Congress has imposed no restrictions on applying for adjustment of status for a paroled alien based on that alien's being in removal proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>2. Context of the Statutory Scheme</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The terms and provisions of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(a) must be understood in the larger context of the statutory scheme. The immigration laws about adjustment of status are not a haphazard compilation of provisions; they are a calibrated set of rules that govern an area of national importance. Congress in many instances has specifically determined when to give discretion to the Attorney General and when to make its own policy choices. Viewing the statutory scheme in this manner clarifies two things: first, that the exclusion of parolees in removal proceedings renders ineligible most of the class that Congress rendered eligible by including parolees (for Congress clearly stated that most parolees would be in removal proceedings), and second, that the congressional choice to delegate to the Attorney General some circumscribed discretion over the ultimate decision of who is granted adjustment of status<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a> is not authorization for discretion in other areas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We explain: one policy choice Congress made was to allow (in some instances) aliens who were otherwise inadmissible on arrival the opportunity to seek adjustment of status relief if they met certain statutory criteria. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255. In 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182, Congress defines the classes of aliens who are ineligible for visas or admission to the United States and makes various exceptions from these blanket rules. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(a). Congress also allows for parole of these inadmissible aliens for \"urgent humanitarian reasons\" or \"significant public benefit.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(d)(5)(A). Congress specifically says parolees are not considered admitted. <i>Id.</i> Despite their status as inadmissible, Congress has also made the policy determination that these paroled aliens should be eligible to apply for adjustment of status, which essentially can act as an admission. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1182 is integral to determinations made in \"inspection,\" which is provided for in 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1225. All arriving aliens and aliens who are present in the United States without an inspection are \"applicants for admission,\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1225(a)(1), and they \"<i>shall</i> be inspected.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1225(a)(3) (emphasis added). Section 1225(b) provides for the inspection of aliens arriving in the United States and certain other aliens who have not been admitted or paroled. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1225(b). If aliens being inspected are not \"clearly and beyond a doubt\" admissible, under section 1182, then they must be referred to removal proceedings. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1225(b)(2)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This context shows that Congress purposefully classified paroled individuals as \"inadmissible,\" and it also determined that they should generally be placed in removal proceedings. But Congress also explicitly allowed paroled individuals to adjust status if they meet the other statutory requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the larger statutory scheme makes clear that in the context of adjustment of status, Congress is particular about where it grants \"discretion\" to the Attorney General. Congress has specified the conditions under which an arriving alien (including a paroled alien) is to be determined inadmissible and <i>must</i> be placed in removal proceedings. The determination as to placing an alien into removal is not a decision committed to agency discretion by Congress. Rather, Congress has defined the terms for initiating removal proceedings against arriving aliens in 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1225(b)(2)(A), which provides that,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[I]n the case of an alien who is an applicant for admission, if the examining immigration officer determines that an alien seeking admission is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted, the <i>alien shall be detained for a [removal proceeding].</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">8 U.S.C. &#167; 1225(b)(2)(A). Congress used the word \"shall\" to mandate that an immigration officer who cannot determine that the applicant for admission is clearly entitled to be admitted has no choice but to place the alien in removal proceedings. After the alien is placed in removal, the Attorney General may parole the alien into the United States in some instances,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a> but the alien still must go through removal proceedings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The incorrectness of the Attorney General's argument can be seen by looking at one of its logical implications. The Attorney General is also given discretion as to the ultimate decision in determining whether to grant asylum to aliens who are eligible for this relief. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1158(a); <i>Cardoza-Fonseca,</i> 480 U.S. at 443-44, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111838\"><a href=\"/opinion/111838/ins-v-cardoza-fonseca/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1207</span></a></span>.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a> If this grant of discretion meant what the government argues here, it would be logical that the Attorney General could similarly decline to allow asylum by issuing a regulation that refused to process applications from categories of asylum applicants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But that is not so. If the asylum applicant meets the eligibility requirements &#8212; if, in other words, the Attorney General determines that an applicant for asylum establishes she has \"a well founded fear of persecution\" on account of one of the statutory grounds &#8212; the alien must be allowed to apply. The Attorney General may only exercise his discretion in granting the asylum.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1158(b); 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(42)(A). Similarly, if the paroled adjustment of status applicant meets the eligibility requirements, the Attorney General may exercise his discretion only in the decision whether to grant permanent resident status. In both asylum and adjustment of status, an alien who satisfies the eligibility requirements to apply \"does not have a right to the [relief],\" but he is \"eligible\" to apply for it. <i>Cardoza-Fonseca,</i> 480 U.S. at 443-44, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111838\"><a href=\"/opinion/111838/ins-v-cardoza-fonseca/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In <i>Lopez,</i> the Supreme Court upheld a regulation of the Bureau of Prisons (BOP), 28 C.F.R. &#167; 550.58(a)(1)(vi)(B), which categorically denied early release to prisoners whose current offense was a drug felony involving the carrying, possession, or use of a firearm. <i>See Lopez,</i> 531 U.S. at 233, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118400\"><a href=\"/opinion/118400/lopez-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The relevant statute states, \"The period a prisoner convicted of a nonviolent offense remains in custody after successfully completing a treatment program may be reduced by the [BOP], but such reduction may not be more than one year from the term the prisoner must otherwise serve.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3621(e)(2)(B).

There are differences in the two statutes. In the adjustment of status statute here, Congress made numerous and explicit policy choices about who is eligible for adjustment of status relief, who is ineligible, and of those ineligible, who is nonetheless eligible with certain application restrictions. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(a) (setting out basic eligibility requirements for adjustment of status); 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1255(c), (e) (limiting the eligibility of otherwise eligible aliens); 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(i) (allowing eligibility to otherwise ineligible aliens). The statutory immigration scheme also constrains the Attorney General's discretion in several ways, including mandating when an arriving alien must be placed in removal proceedings, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1225(b)(2)(A), limiting the discretion of the Attorney General to parole aliens, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(d)(5), and denying the Attorney General the ultimate discretion to adjust the status of some otherwise eligible aliens, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(f). <i>Lopez</i> is a <i>Chevron</i> step two case because of congressional silence; our case, however, is a <i>Chevron</i> step one case because Congress has clearly spoken on the issue of eligibility.

During the Fiscal Year ending June 30, 1958, more than 7,000 aliens in the United States had their eligibility to enter as immigrants determinated in this country prior to sending them to Canada where they briefly appeared before a U.S. consular officer, and then returned to this country with an immigrant visa.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the review of a considerable number of private relief immigration bills seeking adjustment of status of nonimmigrants has further demonstrated to the Committee the desirability of general amendatory legislation on this subject.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">S.Rep.

The new provision read: \"The status of an alien, other than an alien crewman, who was inspected and admitted or paroled into the United States may be adjusted... to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence....\" 74 Stat. at 505. This change broadened the category of individuals eligible for adjustment of status relief. S.Rep.

Congress had repeatedly expressed its \"dissatisfaction with the mounting volume of private legislation\" introduced to adjust the status of certain aliens. <i>Id.</i> at 3137. By adopting the 1960 legislation, Congress wished to alleviate this burden on itself. <i>See id.</i> at 3136. There is some evidence in the legislative history that Congress wished also to alleviate the burden imposed on consular offices to process applications for adjustment of status. The Senate Report emphasizes that in fiscal year 1958, alone, over 7,000 individuals had to leave the United States and apply for a visa in Canada. <i>Id.</i> Indeed, the Department of State commented on the legislation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, in expanding the group of individuals eligible for adjustment of status, Congress clearly evaluated the administrative inconvenience to the INS of the expanded category of those eligible to apply for adjustment of status and nonetheless altered the prior procedure.

It forces paroled aliens in removal proceedings to leave the country to apply for adjustment of status. This imposes considerable burdens on the aliens and, where applicable, their American spouses and relatives. The effect of the regulation, predictably, will be to increase the number of private bills seeking individual adjustment of status, thus burdening Congress. It will also increase the burden on consular offices abroad, because aliens who are otherwise available to adjust status will now have to apply through the consular office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 1960 legislative history of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(a) confirms and enhances our understanding of the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>E. Effect of IIRIRA</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We consider briefly the arguments of both sides that rely on later revisions to the INA, specifically IIRIRA, to support their different understandings of what Congress meant in the adjustment of status provisions of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255. There is no claim that section 1255(a) was amended by IIRIRA or any other statute in any relevant way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Attorney General relies on provisions of IIRIRA to argue that the original understanding of the statute in 1960 must be altered in light of later law, and the statute must now be read as introducing at least ambiguity into section 1255(a), despite the fact that section 1255(a) itself was not amended. The Attorney General argues that new regulations were required due to IIRIRA's replacement of \"entry\" with \"admission\" as the criterion which determines which of two sets of grounds of removal, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1882(a) or 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227, applies in removal proceedings. Further, the Attorney General argues, under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(d)(5)(A), a parole of an alien is not the admission of that alien.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our earlier analysis of the meaning of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(a) in light of the statutory context takes into account the statutory scheme as it exists under IIRIRA. The Attorney General's arguments do not change this understanding; they are unpersuasive because they do not concern the eligibility of paroled aliens to apply for adjustment of status under section 1255(a) or in any way act to limit the eligibility of paroled individuals &#8212; a group Congress specifically deemed eligible &#8212; to adjust status. The classification of paroled aliens as \"not admitted\" is not new to the passage of IIRIRA and does not change the treatment of parolees. Also, the reclassification of aliens \"present pursuant to an entry\" to \"applicants for admission\" does not affect the status of paroled aliens, who have always been considered applicants for admission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner relies on IIRIRA for two points. Specifically, the petitioner argues that since 1960 the agency and Congress have consistently understood the statute to be as petitioner reads it. Moreover, in the major revisions of the immigration laws since 1960, which largely restricted aliens' efforts to remain in this country, Congress has never once restricted the ability of paroled aliens to apply for adjustment of status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This confirms our understanding of the clear meaning of the statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fn35_ref\">35</a> Consistent with our interpretation of the statute, in our view, the changes to the statute with the passage of IIRIRA work against the Attorney General's argument, not in favor of it. Under IIRIRA and previous amendments, Congress amended section 1255 to limit the eligibility for adjustment of status so that certain types of aliens may not apply. Historical &amp; Statutory Notes, 1996 Amendments, 8 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1255. Congress has directly addressed the issue of eligibility for adjustment of status on several occasions, yet these amendments did not limit the category of paroled aliens who may apply for adjustment of status, and they neither gave the Attorney General discretion to redefine eligibility nor did they endorse the additional restrictions on eligibility contained in the Attorney General's regulation. <i>See Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco, Corp.,</i> 529 U.S. at 137, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118347\"><a href=\"/opinion/118347/fda-v-brown-williamson-tobacco-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Reasonableness</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Many of the Attorney General's arguments go to the reasonableness of the regulation. This is a <i>Chevron</i> step two argument. But as previously explained, this is a <i>Chevron</i> step one case, and even the Attorney General's reasonable actions cannot control in the face of clear contrary congressional intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even where there is ambiguity, reasonableness is assessed in light of the statutory scheme. For example, the Attorney General justifies the regulation on the basis that the exercise of discretion was consistent with Congress's desire to speed up the removal process through expedited removal proceedings. 62 Fed.Reg. 444, 452 (Jan. 3, 1997). The desire for administrative efficiency cannot displace clear congressional intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also, the Attorney General argues he has a facially legitimate and bona fide reason for the regulation, citing to the Immigration Control and Financial Responsibility Act of 1996,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fn36_ref\">36</a> which was intended to \"increase control over immigration ... expediting the removal of excludable and deportable aliens, especially criminal aliens, and reducing the abuse of parole and asylum provisions.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn37\" id=\"fn37_ref\">37</a> S.Rep. No. 104-249 at 2 (1994) (not reported in U.S.C.C.A.N.). The short reply is that Congress did not, even in 1996, give the Attorney General unfettered discretion to expedite removal and reduce abuse of parole in disregard of the statutory scheme. Congress expressly did not alter the basic structure of eligibility for application for adjustment of status while simultaneously making a limited category of parolees ineligible. <i>See Cardoza-Fonseca,</i> 480 U.S. at 444-45, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111838\"><a href=\"/opinion/111838/ins-v-cardoza-fonseca/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

As noted in <i>Cardoza-Fonseca,</i>\"An additional reason for rejecting the [Attorney General's] request for heightened deference to [his] position is the inconsistency of the positions the [agency] has taken through the years.
