Héctor M. Laffitte, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                    Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                  Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                   and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\f     Salvador J.

This appeal is the second trip\n\nto this Court for the parties to this litigation.            The parties'\n\ndispute began when Asociación de Educación Privada de Puerto Rico,\n\nInc., a nonprofit private association representing the interests of\n\nprivate primary, secondary, and post-secondary member schools in\n\nPuerto Rico, together with certain individual schools (together,\n\nthe \"private schools\"), filed a complaint against the Secretary of\n\nthe Department of Consumer Affairs of Puerto Rico (\"DACO\").            The\n\ncomplaint alleged that DACO's Rule 11 of Regulation 6458, entitled\n\n\"Regulation for the Disclosure of Information on the Sale and\n\nDistribution of Textbooks\" (\"Reglamento para la Divulgación de\n\nInformación en la Venta y Distribución de Libros de Texto\"),\n\nviolates the private schools' First Amendment rights to free speech\n\nand academic freedom.    The private schools sought a declaration to\n\nthat effect and injunctive relief.        The district court dismissed\n\nthe private schools' complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief\n\ncould be granted.    We reversed that dismissal and remanded the\n\ncase, explaining that the district court had insufficient facts\n\nabout Regulation 6458's implementation and the resulting burdens\n\nand benefits to decide that the private schools had stated no\n\nlegally sufficient claims.\n\n          On   remand,   the   district    court   entered    an   initial\n\nscheduling order asking the parties to submit pretrial briefs\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\faddressing which First Amendment rights are implicated by Rule 11\n\nof Regulation 6458, the nature and weight of the burdens imposed on\n\nthe   private    schools,   and   the   strength   of   the   government's\n\njustifications for imposing the burdens.            The private schools\n\nsubsequently amended their complaint to add a cause of action\n\nalleging that the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico's Law 116 of May 18,\n\n2004 (\"Law 116\"), entitled \"Law for the Acquisition of School\n\nTextbooks\" (\"Ley para la Compra de Libros de Textos Escolares\"),\n\nalso violated the private schools' rights to academic freedom and\n\nfree speech.      The private schools again sought a declaratory\n\njudgment and injunctive relief, as well as costs and attorneys'\n\nfees.\n\n           After a one-day trial, the district court found that Rule\n\n11 of Regulation 6458 and Law 116 violated the private schools'\n\nrights under the First Amendment, holding that neither provision\n\nwas narrowly tailored to further Puerto Rico's legitimate state\n\ninterests.      The Secretary of DACO appealed that ruling.          After\n\ncareful consideration, we affirm the district court's judgment as\n\nto Law 116, reverse its decision as to Rule 11, and remand with\n\ninstructions to modify the permanent injunction to enjoin only that\n\nportion of Rule 11 that violates the private schools' right to\n\nacademic freedom.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f                                I.   Background\n\n          Even though Puerto Rico law makes Puerto Rico's Secretary\n\nof Education responsible for \"establish[ing] the standards and the\n\nrequirements that shall be met by the educational institutions that\n\nrequest a license,\"1 P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 18, § 2113, DACO's\n\nSecretary has also asserted authority over the regulation of\n\nprivate schools.      On May 1, 2002, DACO promulgated Regulation 6458\n\nwith the stated purpose of \"protecting Puerto Rican famil[ies] and\n\nparents, and/or tutors who register their minor children and/or\n\nwards in the private schools of Puerto Rico.\"                Reg. 6458, R.2.\n\nRegulation    6458    was    also    expressly    intended   \"to   define   the\n\nobligations     and    responsibilities          of   schools,     bookstores,\n\ndistributors,    and        publishing    houses      in   relation   to    the\n\ncorresponding processes pertaining to the sale of textbooks.\"               Id.\n\n\n\n\n1\n   The private schools of Puerto Rico are required by statute to\noperate under a license. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 18, § 2111. The\nSecretary of Education's power to regulate schools is subject to a\nproviso protecting the schools' authority to develop their academic\nprograms.   P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 18, § 2117 (\"The license to be\nissued by the Secretary by virtue of this subchapter will be\ninstitutional in nature and shall include the authorization to\nissue diplomas, certificates or degrees up to the maximum academic\nlevel established in the license.      Provided, [t]hat a private\neducational institution, by virtue of the license issued, and\npursuant to academic autonomy this chapter provides, protects and\nfosters, may establish new academic programs, additional courses or\nany other academic measure, provided the same does not exceed the\nmaximum academic level authorized by the license, nor modifies its\ninstitutional objectives or mission.\").\n\n                                       -5-\n\f              Regulation     6458   imposes    several   obligations       on   the\n\nprivate schools.         Rule 8 of the regulation directs schools to post\n\non school grounds, by May 15 of the every year, a list of books to\n\nbe used the following school year.            Id. at R.8(A), (B).       Under this\n\nrule, private schools must also provide DACO and the parents with\n\nthe list of books, which must include \"a briefing on the book, its\n\ntitle, author, publishing house, edition, and publishing year.\"\n\nId. at R.8(C), (D).         Rule 9 instructs private schools to disclose\n\nto DACO and parents final textbook prices and any agreement the\n\nschools have reached with a book seller.                 Id. at R.9(A).         The\n\nschools must disclose on the same notice that \"said agreement or\n\ncontract will in no way infringe on the parents' right to buy the\n\nbooks    in    other   bookstores,    and/or    via   other    distributors      or\n\npublishing houses.\"         Id. at R.9(B).      Moreover, \"[t]he school must\n\nplace the booklist, including a full review, the title of the book,\n\nauthor, publishing house, edition, publication year, and the final\n\nsale price in a highly-conspicuous bulletin board.\" Id. at R.9(D).\n\nRule    10    requires    private   schools    to   inform    parents    of   price\n\nchanges.      Id. at R.10.    Rule 11, the specific provision challenged\n\nby the private schools, provides:\n\n              In the case which [sic] there are changes in\n              the edition, the school will inform [sic] in\n              the book list which of these books have\n              different    editions,   what    the    change\n              specifically consists of, and whether it is a\n              significant change or not, as defined by these\n              regulations. In case that the changes are not\n              significant, the school has to inform the\n\n                                       -6-\n\f          parents on said list, that they have          the\n          option of buying the previous edition.\n\nId. at R.11.   Rule 12 requires schools to disclose to parents the\n\nexistence and applicability of Regulation 6458. Id. at R.12.\n\nSchools must post a notice, in a sign not smaller than eight and a\n\nhalf inches by eleven inches, with a letter size not smaller than\n\ntwenty-two points, not more than five feet away from a place to\n\nwhich parents can have visual access, and between five and six feet\n\nfrom the ground, containing the following language:\n\n          This school has the obligation to inform\n          parents the pertinent process for book sale\n          and distribution in accordance with the\n          Regulations for the Release of Information\n          About the Sale and Distribution of Textbooks\n          of DACO. A copy of these regulations is\n          available in our library. Not complying with\n          the rules set forth in said regulations could\n          lead to the levying of administrative fines in\n          accordance with the DACO Organic Law.\n\nId.   Failure to comply with Regulation 6458 may result in the\n\nimposition of fines of up to $10,000.2   Id. at R.18.\n\n          On May 18, 2004, Law 116 was enacted with the stated\n\npurpose of \"providing that all private schools authorized to\n\noperate in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico must count with the\n\nconsent of the Association, Council of Teachers and Parents to\n\n\n\n2\n   By contrast, Puerto Rico's Education Code provides that \"[a]ny\nnatural or juridical person who operates a private educational\ninstitution as defined in this subchapter without the proper\nlicense provided therein shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon\nconviction thereof, shall be punished with a fine not to exceed\nfive hundred (500) dollars.\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 18, § 2124.\n\n                                -7-\n\fdetermine the maximum budget applicable to each grade for the\n\nacquisition of textbooks required in each school year.\"          Law 116,\n\npreamble.    Law 116 establishes that\n\n            [e]very private school accredited by the\n            General Council of Education that requires the\n            acquisition of school textbooks to their\n            students shall have the consent of [an\n            association or council of parents and teachers\n            of children in that private school] to\n            determine the maximum budget applicable for\n            each school grade for the acquisition of said\n            books required in each school year.\n\nLaw 116, Art. 3.\n\n            Both Law 116 and Regulation 6458 define the relevant\n\nbooks broadly. Under Law 116, \"school textbook\" means \"every text,\n\ndictionary,   reference   textbooks    [sic],   handbook,   pamphlet,   or\n\nmaterial for study required or suggested by any private school for\n\nuse of the academic or curricular program.\"            Id. at Art. 2(c).\n\nRegulation    6458   defines   \"book\"     to    mean    \"all    textbooks,\n\ndictionaries,   reference   books,    handbooks,   pamphlets,    or   study\n\nmaterials required or suggested by a school for the use of their\n\nacademic programs and/or curricula.\"      Reg. 6458 at R.4(H).\n\n            On remand, the district court made the following findings\n\nof fact regarding the implementation of Regulation 6458 and Law\n\n116.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f            Textbooks are pedagogical tools used on a daily basis to\n\nteach substantive information.3             They are also used by teachers and\n\nschool    administrators       to    develop      curricula    and    lesson      plans.\n\nTextbooks are widely used in private primary and secondary schools\n\nin Puerto Rico.\n\n            Private schools choose textbooks that are consistent with\n\ntheir     particular    academic          and    educational    vision,      mission,\n\nphilosophy,     curriculum,         and    methodology,       all    of   which    vary\n\nsignificantly among Puerto Rican private schools.                         In choosing\n\ntextbooks, private schools also consider significant developments\n\nin an educational field, the introduction of a new pedagogical\n\napproach, and the availability of the new edition as opposed to the\n\nold edition of a particular textbook.                 Secondarily, the schools\n\nalso take into account the price and availability of textbooks.\n\n            The textbook selection process is school-specific.                       In\n\ngeneral, private schools will first evaluate a new edition or\n\nseries for whether the textbook is aligned with the school's\n\ncurriculum,     mission,      vision,      philosophy,    and       methodology,    and\n\nwhether    it   meets   the    students'         needs.   Teachers        often     make\n\n\n\n3\n    Textbooks comprise more than their bound volumes alone.\nTextbooks are often accompanied by resource kits, which include\naudio and visual multimedia materials such as audio cassettes,\nCD-ROMs, DVDs, floppy disks, and transparencies.       Moreover,\ntextbooks are frequently accompanied by related workbooks, which\nare usually textbook-edition-specific. These workbooks are often\nused for lesson enforcement, preparation, or extra practice in\ncorrelation with a specific in-class lesson.\n\n                                           -9-\n\findependent evaluations of textbook series or editions based on the\n\nabove-mentioned criteria.        After an initial independent evaluation\n\nby individual teachers, the teachers often meet as a group on\n\nmultiple occasions to determine whether the series or edition meets\n\nthe   criteria.     Teachers     then   share   their   input      with   school\n\nadministrators, who review the teachers' conclusions,                sometimes\n\nmaking     their   own   independent    assessment      of   the    textbooks.\n\nTeachers' input in this process is highly valued by the schools.\n\n            Some private schools retain external consultants with\n\nexpertise in certain substantive areas to advise teachers or\n\nadministrators     about   new    textbooks     or   pedagogical      methods.\n\nParental participation in selecting textbooks in private schools is\n\ntypically minimal or nonexistent. At some private schools, parents\n\nact as a general sounding board or advisory group, but the ultimate\n\ndecision of which books are selected resides with the private\n\nschools.\n\n            Private schools do not generally change the editions or\n\nseries of textbooks for all subject areas at once.              For instance,\n\none Puerto Rican private school evaluates the textbooks at the rate\n\nof approximately two subjects per year.\n\n            Publishing houses inform private schools about their new\n\ntextbook series or editions through conferences, telephone calls,\n\nand direct mailings of brochures, sample textbooks, and educational\n\nkits.    Textbook publishers change the edition of a textbook every\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\ftwo to six years.    Certain substantive areas are apt to change more\n\nfrequently than others.         For instance, new editions of science\n\ntextbooks may be introduced by publishers every two to three years,\n\nwhile English textbook editions usually change only every five or\n\nsix years.    Notice of new textbook editions varies generally from\n\none year to a couple of months before a new academic year.\n\n            After choosing textbooks to be used in the upcoming\n\nacademic year, private schools create a list of the books selected.\n\nConsistent with Rule 8 of Regulation 6458, the schools provide\n\nparents with that list no later than May 15th of the previous\n\nacademic year.\n\n            The use of two different textbooks to teach a class has\n\nin the past resulted in disruption in the classroom.           In the 2004-\n\n05 academic year, a ninth grade Social Studies teacher at Tomás\n\nAlva Edison School, a private secular school in Caguas, Puerto Rico\n\nserving 700 students, decided not to require students to buy the\n\nnew edition of their Social Studies textbook because the teacher\n\nand   the   school   believed    that   the   old   textbook   edition   was\n\nacceptable and the changes between the old and new edition were not\n\nsignificant.     Because the old textbook edition was out of print,\n\nsome students were unable to find it and had to buy the new\n\nedition. Consequently, both editions of the textbooks were used in\n\nthe same classroom.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\f            The   two   editions   were    paginated   differently,   which,\n\naccording    to   the   teacher,    created    disruption   and   classroom\n\nmanagement problems.        Moreover, the teacher was forced to use\n\ncooperative groups to teach some lessons even though the teacher\n\nand school administrators did not think this teaching method was\n\nappropriate for the subject matter.\n\n            Ana Christina Sánchez, the school director of Colegio\n\nAdianez, a private secular primary and secondary school with 780\n\nstudents in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico and the president of the private\n\nschools association also had an experience teaching with two\n\ndifferent textbook editions before the promulgation of Regulation\n\n6458.   Although Sánchez did not think that the changes between the\n\neditions were significant, she found that having two editions of\n\nthe same textbook was disruptive in the classroom, primarily\n\nbecause the same material appeared on different pages.            She stated\n\nthat it was difficult to maintain the students' attention and that\n\na classroom-management problem developed.          After a few weeks, she\n\nrequired all the children to purchase and use only the new edition\n\nof the textbook.\n\n                         II.   Standard of Review\n\n            We review a grant of permanent injunctive relief for\n\nabuse of discretion.      See A.W. Chesterton Co., Inc. v. Chesterton,\n\n128 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1997).             We review a district court's\n\nfindings of fact for clear error.         See Aponte v. Calderón, 284 F.3d\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\f184, 191 (1st Cir. 2002).    Questions of law are reviewed de novo.\n\nSee id.\n\n                         III.   Discussion\n\n          The standard for issuing a permanent injunction requires\n\nthe district court to find that (1) plaintiffs prevail on the\n\nmerits; (2) plaintiffs would suffer irreparable injury in the\n\nabsence of injunctive relief; (3) the harm to plaintiffs would\n\noutweigh the harm the defendant would suffer from the imposition of\n\nan injunction; and (4) the public interest would not be adversely\n\naffected by an injunction.   A.W. Chesterton Co., Inc., 128 F.3d at\n\n5.\n\n          1. Success on the Merits\n\n          The private schools maintain, and the district court\n\nheld, that Rule 11 of Regulation 6458 and Law 116 violate their\n\nright to academic freedom under the First Amendment.     The private\n\nschools argue that by preventing them from selecting and requiring\n\ntextbooks of their choice, Rule 11 of Regulation 6458 and Law 116\n\ninfringe on their constitutional right to determine for themselves,\n\nas educational institutions, what to teach and how to teach it.\n\n          The Supreme Court has recognized that \"[o]ur Nation is\n\ndeeply committed to safeguarding academic freedom, which is of\n\ntranscendental value to all of us.\"    Keyishian v. Bd. of Regents of\n\nUniv. of State of N.Y., 385 U.S. 589, 603 (1967). \"Academic\n\nfreedom, though not a specifically enumerated constitutional right,\n\n\n                                -13-\n\flong has been viewed as a special concern of the First Amendment.\"\n\nRegents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 312 (1978).\n\nThe right to academic freedom \"establish[es] a zone of First\n\nAmendment protection for the educational process itself, which, in\n\nproper circumstances, must include not only students and teachers,\n\nbut their host institutions as well.\"        Cuesnongle v. Ramos, 713\n\nF.2d 881, 884 (1st Cir. 1983).\n\n            In the 1950s, the Supreme Court defined the right to\n\nacademic freedom in a series of decisions limiting the reach of\n\nstate laws that required publicly employed teachers to take loyalty\n\noaths.     In these opinions, the Court invoked academic freedom to\n\nprotect universities, as academic institutions, against government\n\ncontrol.\n\n            The   concern   that   schools   require   protection   from\n\ngovernment interference first appeared in Justice Frankfurter's\n\nconcurring opinion in Weirman v. Updergraff, 344 U.S. 183 (1952).\n\nThe Court in Weirman held that an Oklahoma statute requiring that\n\nstate employees take an oath denying past and present affiliation\n\nwith certain \"subversive\" groups violated the appellants' right to\n\ndue process.      Id. at 191-92.      In his concurrence,       Justice\n\nFrankfurter warned of the \"unwarranted inhibition upon the free\n\nspirit of teachers,\" as it would result in \"caution and timidity.\"\n\nId. at 195 (Frankfurter, J., concurring in the judgment). He wrote\n\nthat \"teachers -- in our entire educational system, from the\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fprimary grades to the university -- . . . cannot carry out their\n\nnoble task if the conditions for the practice of a responsible and\n\ncritical mind are denied to them.\"       Id. at 196 (emphasis added).\n\nThus, \"[t]he functions of educational institutions in our national\n\nlife and the conditions under which alone they can adequately\n\nperform them are at the basis of . . . limitations upon State and\n\nnational power.\"    Id. at 197.\n\n          Five years later, the Court explicitly articulated a\n\ntheory of constitutional protection for academic freedom in Sweezy\n\nv. New Hampshire,    354 U.S. 234 (1957).    A plurality of the Court\n\nheld that a college professor's contempt conviction -- for refusing\n\nto answer the state government's questions about the content of his\n\nlectures and his knowledge of the Communist party -- violated the\n\nprofessor's right to free speech and academic freedom.     See id. at\n\n250. Although the plurality opinion ultimately decided the case on\n\ndue process grounds, it addressed the role of academic freedom:\n\n          The essentiality of freedom in the community\n          of    American    universities    is    almost\n          self-evident. No one should underestimate the\n          vital role in a democracy that is played by\n          those who guide and train our youth.        To\n          impose any strait jacket upon the intellectual\n          leaders in our colleges and universities would\n          imperil the future of our Nation. No field of\n          education is so thoroughly comprehended by man\n          that new discoveries cannot yet be made.\n          Particularly is that true in the social\n          sciences, where few, if any, principles are\n          accepted as absolutes.     Scholarship cannot\n          flourish in an atmosphere of suspicion and\n          distrust. Teachers and students must always\n          remain free to inquire, to study and to\n\n                                  -15-\n\f          evaluate,   to    gain   new    maturity   and\n          understanding; otherwise our civilization will\n          stagnate and die.\n\nId.; see also Urofsky v. Gillmore, 216 F.3d 401, 413 (4th Cir.\n\n2000) (\"[In Sweezy,] six justices agreed that the First Amendment\n\nprotects values of academic freedom.\").\n\n          In his Sweezy concurrence, Justice Frankfurter, who along\n\nwith Justice Harlan provided the votes necessary to reverse,\n\nrelied exclusively on academic freedom as protected by the First\n\nAmendment to find the professor's conviction unconstitutional. Id.\n\nat 266 (Frankfurter, J., concurring in the result).    Warning that\n\n\"governmental intrusion into the intellectual life of a university\"\n\ncreates a \"grave harm,\"   Id. at 261, Justice Frankfurter went on to\n\narticulate an institutional right to academic freedom:\n\n          It is the business of a university to provide\n          that atmosphere which is most conducive to\n          speculation, experiment and creation. It is\n          an atmosphere in which there prevail the four\n          essential freedoms of a university -- to\n          determine for itself on academic grounds who\n          may teach, what may be taught, how it shall be\n          taught, and who may be admitted to study.\n\nId. at 263 (internal quotation marks omitted).4\n\n\n4\n    Justice Frankfurter's articulation of academic freedom as\ninstitutional autonomy was later adopted by Justice Powell in his\nseparate yet controlling opinion in Bakke.       438 U.S. at 312.\nJustice Powell held that even though the Fourteenth Amendment and\nTitle VI prohibited a state from penalizing an applicant on the\nbasis of race, the First Amendment right to academic freedom\nempowered a state university to take race into account in admitting\nstudents when doing so in pursuit of the academic goal of a diverse\nstudent body. Id. at 311-19. Justice Powell relied on the fourth\nof Justice Frankfurter's \"four essential freedoms\" –- the right of\n\n                                -16-\n\f          Three years later, the Court again invoked academic\n\nfreedom to strike down an Arkansas statute compelling teachers to\n\nlist every organization to which they had belonged in the last five\n\nyears.

The Shelton\n\ncourt's decision reiterated the judiciary's willingness to protect\n\nacademic freedom and expanded its purview to secondary schools,\n\nholding that \"[t]he vigilant protection of constitutional freedoms\n\n[of speech, inquiry and association] is nowhere more vital than in\n\nthe community of American schools.\"5      Id. at 487.\n\n\na university to determine for itself on academic grounds who may be\nadmitted to study. Id. at 312. Justice Powell's academic freedom\nrationale was later endorsed by a majority of the Supreme Court in\nGrutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 325 (2003).\n5\n   Although Shelton was the first case in which the Supreme Court\nexplicitly applied the protection of academic freedom in the\nsecondary education context, traces of the Court's willingness to\nprotect the rights of primary and secondary schools to teach as\nthey please existed as early as 1923. In Meyer v. Nebraska, the\nSupreme Court declared a state law prohibiting the teaching of\nforeign languages in private and public schools unconstitutional\nbecause no legitimate state interest justified the regulation that\n\"attempted materially to interfere with the calling of modern\nlanguage teachers, with the opportunities of pupils to acquire\nknowledge, and with the power of parents to control the education\nof their own.\" 262 U.S. 390, 401-03 (1923).\n\n     Two years later, the Supreme Court struck down a state statute\nrequiring all children between the ages of eight and sixteen years\nto attend public school as unconstitutional noting that \"[private\nschools] are engaged in a kind of undertaking not inherently\nharmful, but long regarded as useful and meritorious. Certainly\nthere is nothing in the present records to indicate that they have\nfailed to discharge their obligations to patrons, students, or the\nstate.\" See Pierce v. Soc. of the Sisters of the Holy Names of\nJesus and Mary, 268 U.S. 510, 534-36 (1925).\n\n     Finally,   in   Farrington   v.   Tokushige,   the   Supreme   Court\n\n                                  -17-\n\f          In view of this history, we find that the private schools\n\nhave a First Amendment right to academic freedom.               By the same\n\ntoken, we also acknowledge the right and power of the state to\n\npromulgate reasonable regulations affecting private primary and\n\nsecondary schools to ensure that minimum educational standards are\n\nmet.6   See   Pierce,   268   U.S.    at    534   (\"No   question   is   raised\n\n\naddressed the constitutionality of a Hawaii statute heavily\nregulating private schools. 273 U.S. 284 (1927). The Court held\nthat the statute went \"far beyond mere regulation of privately\nsupported schools\" because it \"[gave] affirmative direction\nconcerning the intimate and essential details of such schools,\nintrust[ed] their control to public officers, and den[ied] both\nowners and patrons reasonable choice and discretion in respect of\nteachers, curriculum and text-books.\" Id. at 297 (emphasis added).\n\n     Although Meyer, Pierce, and Tokushige were decided on due\n process grounds, Meyer, 262 U.S. at 401-03; Pierce, 268 U.S. at\n534-35; Tokushige, 273 U.S. at 298-99, each was decided in the\n1920s, before the Bill of Rights was incorporated into the\nFourteenth Amendment. Thus, although they do not expressly address\na right to academic freedom, these cases stand for the proposition\nthat \"the State may not, consistently with the spirit of the First\nAmendment, contract the spectrum of available knowledge.\" Griswold\nv. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 482 (1965); see also Brown v. Hot,\nSexy & Safer Prods., Inc., 68 F.3d 525, 533 n.5 (1st Cir.\n1995)(noting that Meyer and Pierce would probably be decided today\non First Amendment grounds).\n6\n  There is no doubt of a state's heightened interest in regulating\nprimary and secondary schools.    See Bd. of Educ., Island Trees\nUnion Free Sch. Dist. No. 26 v. Pico, 457 U.S. 853, 864 (1982)\n(noting that states have broad discretion in the management of\nsecondary education because secondary schools \"are vitally\nimportant in the preparation of individuals for preparation as\ncitizens and as vehicles for inculcating fundamental values\nnecessary to the maintenance of a democratic political system\")\n(quotation marks omitted)). As such, the right to academic freedom\nin secondary education is necessarily more circumscribed than that\nof a university.    However, we need not demarcate the precise\nboundaries of academic freedom in primary and secondary schools\nhere.

Mindful of this balancing\n\nrequirement, we examine the constitutionality of Regulation 6458\n\nand Law 116.\n\n               The private schools claim that both Rule 11 of Regulation\n\n6458 and Law 116 violate their right to academic freedom because\n\nthey interfere with their right to determine \"what may be taught\"\n\nand \"how it shall be taught,\" delegating those determinations to\n\n\n\n\ntextbooks implicates academic freedom sufficiently to require the\nstate to demonstrate that the regulation withstands constitutional\nscrutiny.\n\n                                      -19-\n\fthe state government and to parents.7    We analyze each provision in\n\nturn.\n\n                   A. Regulation 6458\n\n          Regulation 6458 requires the private schools to announce\n\nwhat books will be used in a school year, Reg. 6458, R.8, to\n\ndisclose the book prices and any agreements they may have with book\n\nsellers, id. at R.9, to inform parents of any price changes, id. at\n\nR.10, and to disclose to parents the existence and applicability of\n\nRegulation 6458.   Id. at R.9.   Regulation 6458 also requires that\n\n          [i]n the case which [sic] there are changes in\n          the edition, the school will inform in the\n          book list which of these books have different\n          editions,   what   the   change   specifically\n          consists of, and whether it is a significant\n          change   or   not,   as   defined   by   these\n          regulations. In case that the changes are not\n          significant, the school has to inform the\n          parents on [sic] said list, that they have the\n          option of buying the previous edition.\n\nId. at R.11.\n\n          Under    Regulation    6458,   significant   changes   are\n\n\"historical, technological, scientific and/or cultural changes\n\nintegrated in the new edition of a book that are significant and as\n\n\n\n7\n  Law 116 provides the authority of the \"Association or Council of\nParents\" in each private school to approve or reject a private\nschool's proposed textbook budget.     As such, the Association's\nmembers' acts are performed under color of state law, thus\nconstituting acts of the state within the meaning of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. See Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, 372 U.S. 58, 68\n(1963)(finding that acts and practices of a commission created to\n\"encourage morality in youth\" were \"performed under color of state\nlaw\" and thus were state action).\n\n                                 -20-\n\fsuch cause the total or partial revision of one or several chapters\n\nor sections and/or the inclusion of one or several chapters or\n\nsections.\"     Id. at R.4(A).

Additions of one or\n             several sentences to one chapter or section or\n             through a new book edition will not be\n             considered a significant change nor the\n             addition of one or several drawings, graphics,\n             tables, or photos.\n\nId.    Regulation 6458 does not set forth a procedure for resolving\n\ndisputes between DACO and a private school over what may be\n\nconsidered a \"significant change.\"8\n\n             The district court held that \"Rule 11 of Regulation 6458\n\nimposes restraints on [the private schools'] First Amendment rights\n\nof    free   speech   and,   even   more   pointedly,   academic   freedom.\"\n\nAsociación de Educación Privada de Puerto Rico, Inc. v.

There is no indication that the institution of\nsuch a panel will be pursued in the future, nor is it clear that\nthe establishment of such a panel would be dispositive of the\nissues raised by this case.\n\n                                      -21-\n\ftaught.      See Sweezy, 354 U.S. at 263 (Frankfurter, J., concurring\n\nin the result). Textbooks are pedagogical tools essential not only\n\nto    the   teaching    of     substantive     information,       but   also   to   the\n\ndevelopment of effective curricula and lesson plans.                           García\n\nPadilla, 408 F. Supp. 2d at 65-66.\n\n               Teachers at private schools rely heavily on\n               textbooks to create their individualized\n               course syllabi and daily lesson plans.\n               Teachers also rely on textbooks to prepare\n               student assessments, such as examinations.\n               Textbooks are employed as the primary method\n               to convey the substantive content of lessons\n               to students and to impart or strengthen new\n               skills.   Textbooks are widely used in the\n               classroom, as well as for student extra\n               practice,   lesson  preparation   or  review,\n               assessment     preparation,     remediation,\n               enrichment, and homework assignments.\n\nId. at 71-72.\n\n               A school's selection of textbooks is thus closely tied to\n\nits    First    Amendment       right    to    expression.         If   most   of   the\n\ninstruction       presented      to   students      comes   from    textbooks,      the\n\nknowledge       students      glean     from   those    textbooks       significantly\n\ninfluences their understanding of and perspectives on particular\n\nsubjects.         See    M.     David     Bieber,      Textbook     Adoption      Laws,\n\nPrecensorship, and the First Amendment: The Case Against Statewide\n\nSelection of Classroom Materials, 17 J. Marshall L. Rev. 167, 167\n\n(1984)      (arguing    that    state     textbook     adoption     laws   have     been\n\nmanipulated \"to accomplish ideological suppression\" and proposing\n\nthat states \"return control of textbook selection to local school\n\n\n                                          -22-\n\fboards\").    This is especially important in subjects dominated by\n\ndiverging    viewpoints,    discussion,    and     debate,   where    it   is\n\nimpossible to separate factual from ideological content.             See id.;\n\nMartin H. Redish & Kevin Finnerty, What Did You Learn in School\n\nToday?   Free   Speech,    Values   Inculcation,    and   the    Democratic-\n\nEducational Paradox, 88 Cornell L. Rev. 62, 111 (2002) (arguing\n\nthat state control over the public educational process, for example\n\nin the selection of textbooks, threatens First Amendment values).\n\nAccordingly, the selection of textbooks is an important pedagogical\n\ndecision because the chosen textbook often represents the student's\n\nonly source of understanding of these subjects.                 See Redish &\n\nFinnerty, supra (\"By selecting history texts, a school ingrains in\n\nits students a particular understanding of American history, and\n\nthe likelihood that they will be exposed to contrary perspectives\n\nis relatively minimal.\").\n\n            Rule 11 interferes with \"what may be taught\" in private\n\nschools.    Sweezy, 354 U.S. at 263 (Frankfurter, J., concurring in\n\nthe result). Rule 11 dictates that if DACO determines that changes\n\nbetween textbook editions are not significant, a school cannot\n\nrequire parents to buy the newer edition.           The rule thus forces\n\nschools to teach using different textbook editions with differing\n\ncontent.    In fact, Regulation 6458's definition of \"significant\n\nchange\" virtually ensures that the private schools will have to\n\nallow its students to use textbooks with content the schools do not\n\n\n                                    -23-\n\fapprove of, either because it includes information that the schools\n\ndo not wish to teach or because it lacks information the schools\n\nwould like to teach.       For example, a private school may find the\n\ninclusion of new photographs and diagrams in a science textbook\n\nparticularly helpful in teaching a particular concept, and yet Rule\n\n11 of Regulation 6458, by its very terms, would prevent the private\n\nschool from requiring its students to purchase that textbook\n\nbecause under Regulation 6458, the addition of drawings, graphics,\n\ntables,   photographs   does    not    constitute   a   significant    change\n\nbetween textbook editions.      See Reg. 6458, R.4(A).\n\n             More alarmingly, Regulation 6458 may force schools to\n\nteach using books that contain information directly in conflict\n\nwith   its    particular     philosophy,      methodology,    or   mission.\n\nRegulation    6458   provides   that     a   \"significant    change\"    is   a\n\n\"historical, technological, scientific and/or cultural change[]\n\n. . . [that] cause[s] the total or partial revision of one or\n\nseveral chapters or sections and/or the inclusion of one or several\n\nchapters or sections,\" but not \"[t]he exclusion of chapters or\n\nsections\" or \"additions of one or several sentences to one chapter\n\nor section or through a new book edition.\"          Id.   But the exclusion\n\nor inclusion of even one sentence or phrase may very well be\n\nconsidered a significant change by a private school for either\n\nteaching purposes or in light of the school's academic philosophy\n\nor mission.      In fact, seemingly minor changes in text may be\n\n\n                                      -24-\n\fprecisely what makes a book's new edition acceptable to a school\n\nand consistent with the message the school wishes to convey.   For\n\nexample, a book may become acceptable by virtue of the omission in\n\na later edition of language found in prior editions.       Compare\n\nThomas A. Bailey, The American Pageant: A History of the Republic\n\n579 (5th ed. 1975) (describing Jews as \"nerve racked [sic]\"); id.\n\nat 6 (referring to Native Americans as \"near-naked natives\"); id.\n\nat 55 (referring to a woman fighting back \"with all the fury of a\n\nwoman scorned\") with Thomas A. Bailey, The American Pageant: A\n\nHistory of the Republic (10th ed. 1994) (omitting these phrases).\n\nSimilarly, the inclusion or exclusion of even two words, such as\n\n\"intelligent design\" in a new edition of a science textbook may\n\nsubstantially burden the schools' ability to convey deeply held\n\nvalues to their students.   As the district court noted,\n\n          The addition or exclusion of a sentence in a\n          new edition of a textbook stating that,\n          'Evolutionary theory should be critically\n          evaluated against other origin theories,'\n          could be imperative to a given private\n          school's academic philosophy.       A private\n          school, religious or secular, that supports\n          teaching creationism or alternative origin\n          theories might find that the evolution\n          disclaimer is necessary to achieve that end.\n          Conversely, a private school who wishes to\n          exclusively teach evolution theory might find\n          that   the   inclusion   of   a[n]   evolution\n          disclaimer undermines the school's philosophy,\n          and conclude that they want to adopt the new\n          edition of a textbook that has excluded the\n          disclaimer.\n\n\n\n\n                               -25-\n\fGarcía Padilla, 408 F. Supp. 2d at 73.9\n\n           By imposing restrictions on when a private school may\n\nrequire its students to use a particular book, Rule 11 also\n\ninterferes with the private school's freedom to determine how it\n\nteaches.     Under   Rule   11,   once   the   Secretary   deems   a   change\n\ninsignificant, a private school must be prepared to teach two\n\neditions of a textbook, regardless of whether this contravenes the\n\nprivate school's chosen teaching method.           As the district court\n\nfound,\n\n           [r]equiring the use of two textbook editions\n           will be highly burdensome to private schools\n           and their teachers who will have to draft two\n           different sets of lesson plans for each\n           course; contend with resultant case management\n           problems and disruptions; and employ teaching\n           methods that the schools and teachers do not\n           find effective or do not want to utilize.\n\nId. at 72.\n\n\n\n\n9\n  It should also be noted that by allowing parents to purchase the\nold edition of a textbook when DACO determines that a change is\ninsignificant, DACO in effect imposes a disincentive for schools to\nchoose new editions. Faced with the prospect of having to teach\nout of two different books, or worse yet, of having to litigate\nwhat constitutes a \"significant\" change, teachers may well decide\nto keep the old version (if they can find enough copies) rather\nthat choosing the new one for pedagogical reasons. See Crowley v.\nMcKinney, 400 F.3d 965, 969 (7th Cir. 2005) (noting that litigation\nover the correctness of a school's decisions \"would be bound to\ninterfere with the educational mission. . . . not only by\nincreasing schools' legal fees but also and more ominously by\nmaking school administrators and teachers timid because [they are]\nfearful of being entangled in suits by wrathful parents rebuffed in\ntheir efforts to superintend their children's education\").\n\n                                    -26-\n\f               By way of example, the district court credited the\n\ntestimony of a private school Social Studies teacher who decided to\n\nteach using an old textbook edition, rather than the new one,\n\nbecause she did not consider the changes to be significant.          Id. at\n\n67.     However, because the old edition was out of print, some\n\nstudents were unable to find the old edition and had to use the new\n\none.     Id.     The teacher testified that using the two editions\n\ncreated    disruption     in   the   classroom   and   classroom-management\n\nproblems.      Id.   Moreover, because of the shortage of old editions,\n\nthe teacher was sometimes forced to use cooperative groups for the\n\nlessons, even though the teacher and school administration did not\n\nthink that the subject matter should be taught in such a manner.\n\nId.    This example illustrates how restricting the private school's\n\nability to require one book for all students may very well result\n\nin the infringement of a school's chosen teaching methodology.10\n\n\n10\n    This problem is exacerbated by DACO's questionable competence\nin the area it seeks to regulate. Given DACO's general mandate to\n\"defend and implement the rights of the consumer, to restrain the\ninflationary trends; as well as the establishment and inspection of\na price control over the goods and services for use and\nconsumption,\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, § 341b, we express serious\ndoubts as to its institutional competence to regulate academia\neffectively, mindful of the complexity inherent in that endeavor.\nSee Cuesnongle, 713 F.2d at 886 (\"The constitutional issue, of\ncourse, is not the simple one of whether DACO was wrong, but the\nlarger one of whether and to what extent a university, engaged in\nthe highly important and complex enterprise of teaching, should\nproperly be subject to state regulation by an administrative body\nestablished to protect consumers from defective products . . . .\").\nAs the district court noted, \"private schools are better qualified\nto determine whether a change in an edition is significant because,\nunlike DACO, the private schools have expertise in pedagogical\n\n                                      -27-\n\fThus, Rule 11 interferes with autonomous decisionmaking by private\n\nschools and intrudes upon their freedom to pursue their academic\n\nobjectives without interference from the government.\n\n           Although Rule 11 of Regulation 6458 impairs private\n\nschools'   First   Amendment    right   to   academic   freedom,   it   may\n\nnonetheless   be   valid   if   it   survives   constitutional   scrutiny.\n\n\"Because academic freedom rights must ultimately flow from the\n\nFirst Amendment, claims of their violations are subject to all the\n\nusual tests that apply to assertions of First Amendment rights.\"\n\nOmosegbon v. Wells, 335 F.3d 668, 676-77 (7th Cir. 2003).          In this\n\ncase, Rule 11 of Regulation 6458 directly infringes on the private\n\nschools' ability to communicate information to their students, and\n\nas such, we will analyze the regulation as an infringement on the\n\nschools' speech. Thus, in determining whether Rule 11 violates the\n\nFirst Amendment, we look first to whether it is content-neutral,\n\nbecause no matter how valid a government's interest in regulating,\n\n\nmethods and the substantive academic fields under review, and are\nwell acquainted with their institution's unique educational\nmission, philosophy, and methodology.\"    García Padilla, 408 F.\nSupp. 2d at 77.\n\n     The concern regarding institutional competence in government\ninterference with academia is supported by the judiciary's\nlongstanding reluctance to meddle with the discretion of academics,\neither on substantive or procedural grounds, when they make bona\nfide academic decisions. See Regents of the University of Michigan\nv. Ewing, 474 U.S. at 226 (\"[Courts have a reluctance] to trench on\nthe prerogatives of state and local educational institutions and\n[a] responsibility to safeguard their academic freedom, a special\nconcern of the First Amendment.\" (internal quotation marks\nomitted)).\n\n                                     -28-\n\fit generally cannot be pursued by discriminating between particular\n\nviewpoints or subject matters.               See Simon & Schuster, Inc. v.\n\nMembers of N.Y. State Criminal Victims Bd., 502 U.S. 105, 115\n\n(1991).    \"Government action that stifles speech on account of its\n\nmessage, or that requires the utterance of a particular message\n\nfavored by the Government, contravenes the [right to free speech].\"\n\nTurner Broad.

For Krishna Consciousness, Inc., 452 U.S.\n\n640, 649 (1989)).\n\n              We see no hint of bias or censorship in DACO's regulation\n\nof the private schools' choice of textbooks.                      We note that in\n\npromulgating Regulation 6458, DACO was not motivated by hostility\n\n\n                                          -30-\n\fto particular ideas, opinions, or educational philosophies, nor was\n\nDACO concerned with harms that might occur from students' exposure\n\nto particular information.    DACO's interest in adopting Regulation\n\n6458 was to ensure that consumers had sufficient information about\n\ntextbooks -- whatever the message in the textbook itself -- to make\n\nan informed decision about the cost of education in private schools\n\nand to protect consumers against harms resulting from \"arbitrary or\n\nabusive use of new editions of textbooks that merely contain\n\ncosmetic changes,\" harms that would arise independent of any\n\nmessage or teaching that might or might not be adopted by the\n\nprivate schools. On its face, therefore, Regulation 6458, including\n\nRule 11, is content-neutral, censoring no subject, opinion, or\n\neducational philosophy.    Thus, we apply intermediate scrutiny to\n\ndetermine whether the government's interest is substantial and\n\nwhether the effect of the statute on speech and academic freedom is\n\nno greater than necessary to protect DACO's interest.\n\n          DACO's primary goal in promulgating Regulation 6458 is\n\n\"to provide consumers with the information regarding the [sic]\n\ntextbooks in order for them to be able to make an informed decision\n\nabout the cost of education in private schools.\"   Appellant Br. at\n\n50.   We agree with the district court that this is a significant\n\ngovernmental interest.    However, \"[t]hat the Government's asserted\n\ninterests are important in the abstract does not mean . . . that\n\nthe [speech regulation] will in fact advance those interests.\"\n\n\n                                 -31-\n\fTurner Broad. Sys. Inc., 512 U.S. at 664.         We must inquire whether\n\nthe restrictions imposed by Regulation 6458 are narrowly tailored\n\nto further DACO's legitimate state interest.\n\n           The unchallenged provisions of Regulation 6458 provide\n\nconsumers with a significant amount of information about the cost\n\nof textbooks. As noted earlier, Rule 8 requires private schools to\n\nannounce the list of books to be used in the next school year, Rule\n\n9 requires them to disclose book prices as well as their agreement\n\nwith book sellers, Rule 10 requires private schools to inform\n\nparents of price changes, and Rule 12 requires them to inform\n\nparents of the existence and the application of Regulation 6458.\n\n           Rule 11 also provides consumers with information about\n\nthe cost of private schooling.      When schools assign a new textbook\n\nedition, Rule 11 requires them to disclose \"which [books] have\n\ndifferent editions, what the change specifically consists of, and\n\nwhether it is a significant change or not, as defined by these\n\nregulations.\"      R.11.     This    disclosure    requirement      provides\n\ninformation about how book costs are determined, which allows\n\nparents   to   determine   for   themselves   which    costs   of    private\n\neducation they are willing to pay for.        The disclosure aspects of\n\nRule 11, therefore, also enable parents \"to make an informed\n\ndecision about the cost of education in private schools.\"\n\n           However, Rule 11's requirement that parents have the\n\noption of purchasing the old edition of an assigned textbook is not\n\n\n                                    -32-\n\frelevant, much less narrowly tailored, to the achievement of DACO's\n\ngoal of providing consumers with information. The purpose of that\n\nrequirement is not to provide parents with information, it is to\n\nsave parents money.   We therefore find that the option requirement\n\nis not narrowly tailored to the state's proffered interest in\n\nproviding information about the cost of private education.\n\n          DACO's second goal is purportedly to protect consumers\n\nfrom \"the arbitrary or abusive use of new editions of textbooks\n\nthat merely contain cosmetic changes.\"    Appellant Br. at 50.   If\n\nthis were in fact a problem, we might have some reason to pause in\n\nour judgment.   However, the district court noted that\n\n          [t]he record in this case is entirely devoid\n          of any evidence which suggests that the prices\n          of textbooks are excessive, or that textbook\n          publishers'    or    distributors'    pricing,\n          marketing, or other practices are in any way\n          abusive, unfair or arbitrary.      Defendant's\n          only argument proffered in support of its\n          allegation of abuse and unfairness is the fact\n          that text book production and distribution is\n          a for-profit industry.    This, without more,\n          cannot offend notions of justice in our\n          free-enterprise system. Further, it appears\n          that Regulation 6458 was promulgated without\n          any investigation, hearings, consultation with\n          education experts, evidence, findings, or any\n          other foundation which demonstrated that the\n          textbook publishers' or distributors['] prices\n          or   practices   are   abusive,   unfair,   or\n          arbitrary. It also appears that DACO had no\n          legitimate basis to conclude that consumers\n          would prospectively become at risk of such\n          exploitation by the textbook industry.\n\nGarcía Padilla, 408 F. Supp. 2d at 77.\n\n\n\n                                -33-\n\f           On appeal, DACO has not attempted to supplement the\n\ninformation it provided to the district court regarding the need\n\nfor this regulation.11   DACO points only to complaints it received\n\nfrom parents regarding \"the excessive costs of textbooks\" in\n\nprivate schools.   Appellant Br. at 52-53.     Such complaints are\n\ninsufficient to establish a legitimate state interest.12   \"When the\n\nGovernment defends a regulation on speech as a means to redress\n\npast harms or to prevent anticipated harms, it must do more than\n\nsimply posit the existence of the disease sought to be cured.\"\n\nTurner Broad. Sys., Inc., 512 U.S. at 664 (internal quotation marks\n\nand citation omitted).    DACO must \"demonstrate that the recited\n\nharms are real, not merely conjectural, and that the regulation\n\nwill in fact alleviate these harms in a direct and material way.\"\n\nId.   We cannot conclude that DACO has a legitimate state interest\n\nin fixing a problem it has not shown to exist.   Moreover, because\n\nthere is no evidence of a problem, DACO's proposed solution cannot\n\nbe narrowly tailored to it.\n\n\n\n\n11\n   Nor is it clear that DACO could at this point in the litigation\nsupplement the information it provided to the district court. See\nFed. R. App. P. 10(a).\n12\n   It is even difficult to discern what the complaints mean, let\nalone how Regulation 6458 will address them. How are these prices\nexcessive?    Excessive in relation to what?       The absence of\nstandards against which we might be able to judge the need for\nconsumer protection legislation in the textbook publishing industry\nrenders DACO's assertion of a substantial state interest mere\nspeculation.\n\n                                -34-\n\f            But even if we were to accept the premise that consumers\n\nneed protection from \"the arbitrary or abusive use of textbooks\n\nthat only contain cosmetic changes,\" a further problem remains in\n\nthat Rule 11's option requirement is substantially broader than\n\nnecessary for DACO to successfully address this interest.                      The\n\nobligations imposed by Rule 11 are not confined to instances in\n\nwhich a new edition of a textbook contains only \"cosmetic\" changes.\n\nAs discussed above, many changes considered by DACO not to be\n\nsignificant could qualify as more than cosmetic. For instance, the\n\nexclusion of a chapter or section, the addition of one or several\n\nsentences to a chapter, section or throughout a book, and the\n\naddition    of    one   or    several    drawings,    graphics,      tables,   or\n\nphotographs could very well be significant, non-cosmetic changes,\n\ndepending    on    their     content.    Thus,   we   find    that    Rule   11's\n\nrequirement that parents have the option of purchasing the old\n\nedition of an assigned textbook does not survive intermediate\n\nscrutiny and, as such, violates the schools' constitutional right\n\nto academic freedom.\n\n            In considering this issue, the district court held that\n\nRule 11 is unconstitutional in its entirety.                 On this point, we\n\ndisagree with the district court.                As noted above, Rule 11's\n\ndisclosure requirements survive constitutional scrutiny because\n\nthey are narrowly tailored to the state's significant interest in\n\nproviding parents with information about the cost of private\n\n\n                                        -35-\n\feducation.    Mindful of our duty to preserve as much of a state law\n\nas possible by only severing the problematic portions of the law,\n\nwe only hold unconstitutional Rule 11's requirement that parents\n\nhave the option of purchasing the old edition of an assigned\n\ntextbook.    See Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of N. New England, 126\n\nS. Ct. 961, 967 (2006).\n\n                   B. Law 116\n\n            Law 116 provides that \"[e]very private school accredited\n\nby the General Council of Education that requires the acquisition\n\nof school textbooks to [sic] their students shall have the consent\n\nof the Association or Council of Parents or of an Assembly of\n\nParents to determine the maximum budget applicable for each school\n\ngrade for the acquisition of said books required in each school\n\nyear.\"13    Law 116, Art.

V.\n\n\"The private school shall illustrate to the Association or Council\n\nof Parents . . . the benefits of the recommended budget, and said\n\n\n\n\n13\n    \"Private school\" means \"any private educational institution\nwhich with or without profit motives, religious or secular, devotes\n[sic] to the education of preschool, elementary, and intermediate,\nand/or secondary, or special education, within the territorial\nlimits of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\" Law 116, Art. II(b).\nLaw 116 defines \"Association or Council of Parents and Teachers\" to\nmean \"groups of parents and teachers belonging to a private school\nauthorized to operate in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\" Id. at\nArt.

VI.\n\n               The district court held that Law 116 imposes restraints\n\non the private schools' right to academic freedom under the First\n\nAmendment because it restricts their freedom to determine \"what\n\nshall be taught and how it shall be taught.\"                  See García Padilla,\n\n408 F. Supp. 2d at 79 (quoting Sweezy, 354 U.S. at 263).                    We agree.\n\n               In requiring private schools to obtain parental consent\n\nfor the textbook budget, Law 116 significantly limits the schools'\n\nability to choose their own books. Under the statute, parents have\n\nthe    power    to    set   the   private        schools'    textbook      budget   by\n\nwithholding consent until the school agrees to a particular budget.\n\nThis    power    to   set   a   maximum    budget,    in     turn,   restricts      the\n\navailable choices for textbooks because the total price of all\n\ntextbooks chosen must be within the approved budget.                    In essence,\n\nLaw    116   forces    schools,    at   the      margins,    to   choose    textbooks\n\naccording to price, rather than content.                    This is a significant\n\nrestriction on private schools' choice of textbooks.\n\n\n\n14\n    Parents' participation in the textbook selection approval\nprocess is apparently limited by an exception providing that\n\"[n]othing provided by this law authorizes the Association, Council\nor Assembly of Parents to limit or interfere in any manner in\nregard to textbooks or books with religious context.\" Law 116,\nArt. V.\n\n                                          -37-\n\f           As discussed above, a school's selection of textbooks\n\nautomatically raises First Amendment concerns because textbook-\n\nselection implicates the school's ability to convey a particular\n\nmessage, as well as its ability to convey the message effectively.\n\nThus, a restriction on the school's choice of textbooks -- and in\n\nparticular one as severe as Law 116 -- interferes with the private\n\nschool's right to determine for itself \"what may be taught\" and\n\n\"how it shall be taught.\"      See Sweezy, 354 U.S. at 263 (internal\n\nquotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n           Having determined that Law 116 infringes on activity\n\nprotected under the First Amendment, we must decide the level of\n\nscrutiny   to   apply   to   the   statute.   As   with   Rule   11,   the\n\nrestrictions Law 116 imposes on the private schools' determinations\n\nof what to teach and how to teach are restrictions on the private\n\nschools' speech.    We therefore apply the same standard governing\n\ntime, place, and manner restrictions discussed above.15 Again, such\n\n\n15\n   Because the private schools did not argue that Law 116 imposed\na prior restraint on their academic freedom, we will not analyze it\nas such. However, we take this opportunity to note that the law is\nsusceptible to such an analysis because it \"limits or conditions in\nadvance the exercise of protected First Amendment activity.\"\nFantasy Book Shop, Inc. v.

Ward,\n\n491 U.S. at 791.\n\n           As stated earlier, the test for whether a restriction is\n\ncontent-based is whether the government has adopted it \"because of\n\n[agreement] or disagreement with the message it conveys.\"          Id.   As\n\nwith Regulation 6458, we see no bias or prejudice toward particular\n\nideas motivating Law 116.     There is no evidence to suggest that in\n\nenacting Law 116, the Puerto Rico legislature was seeking to\n\npromote or frustrate the discussion of any particular message or\n\nsubject matter.    We therefore agree with the district court that\n\nthis statute is content-neutral.       See Ward, 491 U.S. at 791.\n\n           The government's principal interest in enacting Law 116\n\nis \"to provide the parents of school-age children attending private\n\nschools   an   opportunity   to   participate   in   the   decision-making\n\nprocess for determining the budget to be spent on textbooks.\"\n\nAppellant Br. at 67.    The government justifies this interest \"[i]n\n\nlight of the increasing cost of textbooks that parents have to face\n\neach school year, in addition to the school tuition and additional\n\nschool fees.\"    Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -39-\n\f           Assuming     that   parental     participation   in     a   private\n\nschool's budgetary decisions is a significant state interest,16 we\n\nagree with the district court that Law 116 is not narrowly tailored\n\nto that interest, nor does it leave open ample alternative methods\n\nof communication.       García-Padilla, 408 F. Supp. 2d at 80.            As a\n\npreliminary matter, Law 116 is substantially broader than necessary\n\nto achieve the state's purported interest.         There are many ways in\n\nwhich   parents   can    participate   in    private   schools'     budgetary\n\ndecisions short of having veto power over the budget.            The power to\n\nveto a budgetary decision is quite a high level of participation --\n\none that, as we noted earlier, may completely foreclose certain\n\ntextbook options for the private schools.              The requirement of\n\nparental   consent      for    the   textbook    budget     thus       \"burdens\n\nsubstantially more speech and academic freedom than necessary to\n\nfurther [the state's] interest.\"        Id. (citing Turner Broad. Sys.,\n\nInc., 520 U.S. at 185).\n\n           Law 116 also does not leave open enough alternative\n\nchannels of communication to survive intermediate scrutiny.                 As\n\ndiscussed above, if parents do not approve the schools' proposed\n\nbudget, which takes into account prices for the school's chosen\n\ntextbooks, the school will be prevented from using one or more of\n\n\n16\n   We make no judgment as to whether this asserted governmental\ninterest is a significant one, except to say that we would require\nmore information about the need for parental participation in\nschool budgetary determinations before so holding. Nevertheless,\nthe district court avoided the question, and so will we.\n\n                                     -40-\n\fits chosen textbooks.     Law 116 may effectively preclude a school\n\nfrom using a particular textbook to teach its students.            Thus, Law\n\n116 violates the private schools' right to academic freedom under\n\nthe First Amendment because it is not narrowly tailored to a\n\nsignificant governmental interest and because it does not leave\n\nopen ample alternative methods of communication.\n\n            Thus, the first factor for the imposition of a permanent\n\ninjunction is satisfied; the private schools prevail on the merits\n\nbecause Rule 11's option requirement and Law 116 have been shown to\n\nviolate their right to academic freedom under the First Amendment.\n\n                   C. Irreparable Harm\n\n            With respect to the harm suffered by the private schools,\n\nwe note that it has long been held that \"[t]he loss of First\n\nAmendment    freedoms,    for   even        minimal   periods     of     time,\n\nunquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.\"            Elrod v. Burns,\n\n427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976).           As such, the private schools have\n\nsatisfied the second factor.\n\n                   D. Balance of Equities\n\n            The balance of equities in this case also supports the\n\ngranting of a permanent injunction.          Although the district court\n\ndid not explicitly compare the harms suffered by the parties to\n\nthis case, it did note a significant lack of foundation for the\n\nproffered harms the government was claiming to remedy with the\n\nregulation   and   the   statute.      It    cannot   be   said   that    such\n\n\n                                    -41-\n\fconjectural harms outweigh concrete harms to the private schools'\n\nconstitutionally protected right to academic freedom.      On this\n\nrecord, the district court's finding that the harm to the private\n\nschools outweighs the harm to the government was proper.\n\n                 E. Public Interest\n\n          The final consideration is the effect of an injunction on\n\nthe public interest. Schools have the extraordinary responsibility\n\nof educating our youth.   While there is no question in our minds\n\nthat the government has a substantial interest in our system of\n\neducation, we must acknowledge that the task of educating is made\n\nmore difficult by government interference with what schools teach\n\nand how they teach it.    This is particularly true in the case of\n\nprivate educational institutions, in which parents voluntarily\n\nchoose to enroll their children, at least in part because of the\n\nschools' educational philosophies, methodologies, and reputations.\n\nIn view of the fact that Rule 11's option requirement and Law 116\n\nare far broader than necessary to ensure that parents are informed\n\nof and involved in the textbook selection process of private\n\nschools, we find that the public is well-served by the district\n\ncourts' imposition of a permanent injunction in this case.\n\n                          IV.   Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we affirm in part and reverse\n\nin part, and remand with instructions for the district court to\n\nmodify the permanent injunction to enjoin only that portion of Rule\n\n\n                                -42-\n\f11 of Regulation 6458 that requires schools to give parents the\n\noption of purchasing the old edition of an assigned textbook.\n\n          Affirmed in part, Reversed and Remanded in part. Each\n\nparty shall bear their own costs.\n\n\n\n\n                              -43-\n\f",

The parties' dispute began when Asociaci&#243;n de Educaci&#243;n Privada de Puerto Rico, Inc., a nonprofit private association representing the interests of private primary, secondary, and post-secondary member schools in Puerto Rico, together with certain individual schools (together, the \"private schools\"), filed a complaint against the Secretary of the Department of Consumer Affairs of Puerto Rico (\"DACO\"). The complaint alleged that DACO's Rule 11 of Regulation 6458, entitled \"Regulation for the Disclosure of Information on the Sale and Distribution of Textbooks\" (\"Reglamento para la Divulgaci&#243;n de Informaci&#243;n en la Venta y Distribuci&#243;n de Libros de Texto\"), violates the private schools' First Amendment rights to free speech and academic freedom. The private schools sought a declaration to that effect and injunctive relief. The district court dismissed the private schools' complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. We reversed that dismissal and remanded the case, explaining that the district court had insufficient facts about Regulation 6458's implementation and the resulting burdens and benefits to decide that the private schools had stated no legally sufficient claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the district court entered an initial scheduling order asking the parties to submit pretrial briefs addressing which First Amendment rights are implicated by Rule 11 of Regulation 6458, the nature and weight of the burdens imposed on the private schools, and the strength of the government's justifications for imposing the burdens. The private schools subsequently amended their complaint to add a cause of action alleging that the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico's Law 116 of May 18, 2004 (\"Law 116\"), entitled \"Law for the Acquisition of School Textbooks\" (\"Ley para la Compra de Libros de Textos Escolares\"), also violated the private schools' rights to academic freedom and free speech. The private schools again sought a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, as well as costs and attorneys' fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a one-day trial, the district court found that Rule 11 of Regulation 6458 and Law 116 violated the private schools' rights under the First Amendment, holding that neither provision was narrowly tailored to further Puerto Rico's legitimate state interests. The Secretary of DACO appealed that ruling. After careful consideration, we affirm the district court's judgment as to Law 116, reverse its decision as to Rule 11, and remand with instructions to modify the permanent injunction to enjoin only that portion of Rule 11 that violates the private schools' right to academic freedom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even though Puerto Rico law makes Puerto Rico's Secretary of Education responsible for \"establish[ing] the standards and the requirements that shall be met by the educational institutions that request a license,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 18, &#167; 2113, DACO's Secretary has also asserted authority over the regulation of private schools. On May 1, 2002, DACO promulgated Regulation 6458 with the stated purpose of \"protecting Puerto Rican famil[ies] and parents, and/or tutors who register their minor children and/or wards in the private schools of Puerto Rico.\" Reg. 6458, R.2. Regulation 6458 was also expressly intended \"to define the obligations and responsibilities of schools, bookstores, distributors, and publishing houses in relation to the corresponding processes pertaining to the sale of textbooks.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regulation 6458 imposes several obligations on the private schools. Rule 8 of the regulation directs schools to post on school grounds, by May 15 of the every year, a list of books to be used the following school year. <i>Id.</i> at R.8(A), (B). Under this rule, private schools must also provide DACO and the parents with the list of books, which must include \"a briefing on the book, its title, author, publishing house, edition, and publishing year.\" <i>Id.</i> at R.8(C), (D). Rule 9 instructs private schools to disclose to DACO and parents final textbook prices and any agreement the schools have reached with a book seller. <i>Id.</i> at R.9(A). The schools must disclose on the same notice that \"said agreement or contract will in no way infringe on the parents' right to buy the books in other bookstores, and/or via other distributors or publishing houses.\" <i>Id.</i> at R.9(B). Moreover, \"[t]he school must place the booklist, including a full review, the title of the book, author, publishing house, edition, publication year, and the final sale price in a highly-conspicuous bulletin board.\" <i>Id.</i> at R.9(D). Rule 10 requires private schools to inform parents of price changes. <i>Id.</i> at R.10. Rule 11, the specific provision challenged by the private schools, provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case which [sic] there are changes in the edition, the school will inform [sic] in the book list which of these books have different editions, what the change specifically consists of, and whether it is a significant change or not, as defined by these regulations.

Under Law 116, \"school textbook\" means \"every text, dictionary, reference textbooks [sic], handbook, pamphlet, or material for study required or suggested by any private school for use of the academic or curricular program.\" <i>Id.</i> at Art. 2(c). Regulation 6458 defines \"book\" to mean \"all textbooks, dictionaries, reference books, handbooks, pamphlets, or study materials required or suggested by a school for the use of their academic programs and/or curricula.\" Reg. 6458 at R.4(H).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the district court made the following findings of fact regarding the implementation of Regulation 6458 and Law 116.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Textbooks are pedagogical tools used on a daily basis to teach substantive information.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> They are also used by teachers and school administrators to develop curricula and lesson plans. Textbooks are widely used in private primary and secondary schools in Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Private schools choose textbooks that are consistent with their particular academic and educational vision, mission, philosophy, curriculum, and methodology, all of which vary significantly among Puerto Rican private schools. In choosing textbooks, private schools also consider significant developments in an educational field, the introduction of a new pedagogical approach, and the availability of the new edition as opposed to the old edition of a particular textbook. Secondarily, the schools also take into account the price and availability of textbooks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The textbook selection process is school-specific. In general, private schools will first evaluate a new edition or series for whether the textbook is aligned with the school's curriculum, mission, vision, philosophy, and methodology, and whether it meets the students' needs. Teachers often make independent evaluations of textbook series or editions based on the above-mentioned criteria. After an initial independent evaluation by individual teachers, the teachers often meet as a group on multiple occasions to determine whether the series or edition meets the criteria. Teachers then share their input with school administrators, who review the teachers' conclusions, sometimes making their own independent assessment of the textbooks. Teachers' input in this process is highly valued by the schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some private schools retain external consultants with expertise in certain substantive areas to advise teachers or administrators about new textbooks or pedagogical methods. Parental participation in selecting textbooks in private schools is typically minimal or nonexistent. At some private schools, parents act as a general sounding board or advisory group, but the ultimate decision of which books are selected resides with the private schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Private schools do not generally change the editions or series of textbooks for all subject areas at once. For instance, one Puerto Rican private school evaluates the textbooks at the rate of approximately two subjects per year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Publishing houses inform private schools about their new textbook series or editions through conferences, telephone calls, and direct mailings of brochures, sample textbooks, and educational kits. Textbook publishers change the edition of a textbook every two to six years. Certain substantive areas are apt to change more frequently than others. For instance, new editions of science textbooks may be introduced by publishers every two to three years, while English textbook editions usually change only every five or six years. Notice of new textbook editions varies generally from one year to a couple of months before a new academic year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After choosing textbooks to be used in the upcoming academic year, private schools create a list of the books selected. Consistent with Rule 8 of Regulation 6458, the schools provide parents with that list no later than May 15th of the previous academic year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The use of two different textbooks to teach a class has in the past resulted in disruption in the classroom. In the 2004-05 academic year, a ninth grade Social Studies teacher at Tom&#225;s Alva Edison School, a private secular school in Caguas, Puerto Rico serving 700 students, decided not to require students to buy the new edition of their Social Studies textbook because the teacher and the school believed that the old textbook edition was acceptable and the changes between the old and new edition were not significant. Because the old textbook edition was out of print, some students were unable to find it and had to buy the new edition. Consequently, both editions of the textbooks were used in the same classroom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two editions were paginated differently, which, according to the teacher, created disruption and classroom management problems. Moreover, the teacher was forced to use cooperative groups to teach some lessons even though the teacher and school administrators did not think this teaching method was appropriate for the subject matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ana Christina S&#225;nchez, the school director of Colegio Adianez, a private secular primary and secondary school with 780 students in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico and the president of the private schools association also had an experience teaching with two different textbook editions before the promulgation of Regulation 6458. Although S&#225;nchez did not think that the changes between the editions were significant, she found that having two editions of the same textbook was disruptive in the classroom, primarily because the same material appeared on different pages. She stated that it was difficult to maintain the students' attention and that a classroom-management problem developed. After a few weeks, she required all the children to purchase and use only the new edition of the textbook.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.

Success on the Merits</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The private schools maintain, and the district court held, that Rule 11 of Regulation 6458 and Law 116 violate their right to academic freedom under the First Amendment. The private schools argue that by preventing them from selecting and requiring textbooks of their choice, Rule 11 of Regulation 6458 and Law 116 infringe on their constitutional right to determine for themselves, as educational institutions, what to teach and how to teach it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has recognized that \"[o]ur Nation is deeply committed to safeguarding academic freedom, which is of transcendental value to all of us.\" <i>Keyishian v.

Teachers also rely on textbooks to prepare student assessments, such as examinations. Textbooks are employed as the primary method to convey the substantive content of lessons to students and to impart or strengthen new skills. Textbooks are widely used in the classroom, as well as for student extra practice, lesson preparation or review, assessment preparation, remediation, enrichment, and homework assignments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 71-72.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A school's selection of textbooks is thus closely tied to its First Amendment right to expression. If most of the instruction presented to students comes from textbooks, the knowledge students glean from those textbooks significantly influences their understanding of and perspectives on particular subjects. <i>See</i> M. David Bieber, <i>Textbook Adoption Laws, Precensorship, and the First Amendment: The Case Against Statewide Selection of Classroom Materials,</i> 17 J. Marshall L.Rev. 167, 167 (1984) (arguing that state textbook adoption laws have been manipulated \"to accomplish ideological suppression\" and proposing that states \"return control of textbook selection to local school boards\"). This is especially important in subjects dominated by diverging viewpoints, discussion, and debate, where it is impossible to separate factual from ideological content. <i>See id.</i>; Martin H. Redish &amp; Kevin Finnerty, <i>What Did You Learn in School Today? Free Speech, Values Inculcation, and the Democratic-Educational Paradox,</i> 88 Cornell L.Rev. 62, 111 (2002) (arguing that state control over the public educational process, for example in the selection of textbooks, threatens First Amendment values). Accordingly, the selection of textbooks is an important pedagogical decision because the chosen textbook often represents the student's only source of understanding of these subjects. <i>See</i> Redish &amp; Finnerty, <i>supra</i> (\"By selecting history texts, a school ingrains in its students a particular understanding of American history, and the likelihood that they will be exposed to contrary perspectives is relatively minimal.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 11 interferes with \"what may be taught\" in private schools. <i>Sweezy,</i> 354 U.S. at 263, 77 S.Ct. 1203 (Frankfurter, J., concurring in the result). Rule 11 dictates that if DACO determines that changes between textbook editions are not significant, a school cannot require parents to buy the newer edition. The rule thus forces schools to teach using different textbook editions with differing content. In fact, Regulation 6458's definition of \"significant change\" virtually ensures that the private schools will have to allow its students to use textbooks with content the schools do not approve of, either because it includes information that the schools do not wish to teach or because it lacks information the schools would like to teach. For example, a private school may find the inclusion of new photographs and diagrams in a science textbook particularly helpful in teaching a particular concept, and yet Rule 11 of Regulation 6458, by its very terms, would prevent the private school from requiring its students to purchase that textbook because under Regulation 6458, the addition of drawings, graphics, tables, photographs does not constitute a significant change between textbook editions. <i>See</i> Reg. 6458, R.4(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More alarmingly, Regulation 6458 may force schools to teach using books that contain information directly in conflict with its particular philosophy, methodology, or mission. Regulation 6458 provides that a \"significant change\" is a \"historical, technological, scientific and/or cultural change[ ] ... [that] cause[s] the total or partial revision of one or several chapters or sections and/or the inclusion of one or several chapters or sections,\" but not \"[t]he exclusion of chapters or sections\" or \"additions of one or several sentences to one chapter or section or through a new book edition.\" <i>Id.</i> But the exclusion or inclusion of even one sentence or phrase may very well be considered a significant change by a private school for either teaching purposes or in light of the school's academic philosophy or mission. In fact, seemingly minor changes in text may be precisely what makes a book's new edition acceptable to a school and consistent with the message the school wishes to convey. For example, a book may become acceptable by virtue of the omission in a later edition of language found in prior editions. <i>Compare</i> Thomas A. Bailey, <i>The American Pageant: A History of the Republic</i> 579 (5th ed.1975) (describing Jews as \"nerve racked [sic]\"); <i>id.</i> at 6 (referring to Native Americans as \"near-naked natives\"); <i>id.</i> at 55 (referring to a woman fighting back \"with all the fury of a woman scorned\") <i>with</i> Thomas A. Bailey, <i>The</i> <i>American Pageant: A History of the Republic</i> (10th ed.1994) (omitting these phrases). Similarly, the inclusion or exclusion of even two words, such as \"intelligent design\" in a new edition of a science textbook may substantially burden the schools' ability to convey deeply held values to their students. As the district court noted,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The addition or exclusion of a sentence in a new edition of a textbook stating that, `Evolutionary theory should be critically evaluated against other origin theories,' could be imperative to a given private school's academic philosophy. A private school, religious or secular, that supports teaching creationism or alternative origin theories might find that the evolution disclaimer is necessary to achieve that end. Conversely, a private school who wishes to exclusively teach evolution theory might find that the inclusion of a[n] evolution disclaimer undermines the school's philosophy, and conclude that they want to adopt the new edition of a textbook that has excluded the disclaimer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\"><i>Garc&#237;a Padilla,</i> 408 F.Supp.2d at 73.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By imposing restrictions on when a private school may require its students to use a particular book, Rule 11 also interferes with the private school's freedom to determine <i>how</i> it teaches. Under Rule 11, once the Secretary deems a change insignificant, a private school must be prepared to teach two editions of a textbook, regardless of whether this contravenes the private school's chosen teaching method.

However, because the old edition was out of print, some students were unable to find the old edition and had to use the new one. <i>Id.</i> The teacher testified that using the two editions created disruption in the classroom and classroom-management problems. <i>Id.</i> Moreover, because of the shortage of old editions, the teacher was sometimes forced to use cooperative groups for the lessons, even though the teacher and school administration did not think that the subject matter should be taught in such a manner. <i>Id.</i> This example illustrates how restricting the private school's ability to require one book for all students may very well result in the infringement of a school's chosen teaching methodology.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Thus, Rule 11 interferes with autonomous decisionmaking by private schools and intrudes upon their freedom to pursue their academic objectives without interference from the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Rule 11 of Regulation 6458 impairs private schools' First Amendment right to academic freedom, it may nonetheless be valid if it survives constitutional scrutiny. \"Because academic freedom rights must ultimately flow from the First Amendment, claims of their violations are subject to all the usual tests that apply to assertions of First Amendment rights.\" <i>Omosegbon v. Wells,</i> 335 F.3d 668, 676-77 (7th Cir.2003). In this case, Rule 11 of Regulation 6458 directly infringes on the private schools' ability to communicate information to their students, and as such, we will analyze the regulation as an infringement on the schools' speech. Thus, in determining whether Rule 11 violates the First Amendment, we look first to whether it is content-neutral, because no matter how valid a government's interest in regulating, it generally cannot be pursued by discriminating between particular viewpoints or subject matters. <i>See Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N.Y. State Criminal Victims Bd.,</i> 502 U.S. 105, 115, 112 S.Ct. 501, 116 L.Ed.2d 476 (1991). \"Government action that stifles speech on account of its message, or that requires the utterance of a particular message favored by the Government, contravenes the [right to free speech].\" <i>Turner Broad.

Under intermediate scrutiny, restrictions imposed by a statute need not be the least restrictive or least intrusive means of accomplishing the statute's legitimate governmental interest. <i>See Ward,</i> 491 U.S. at 798-99, 109 S.Ct. 2746.

DACO's interest in adopting Regulation 6458 was to ensure that consumers had sufficient information about textbooks&#8212;whatever the message in the textbook itself&#8212;to make an informed decision about the cost of education in private schools and to protect consumers against harms resulting from \"arbitrary or abusive use of new editions of textbooks that merely contain cosmetic changes,\" harms that would arise independent of any message or teaching that might or might not be adopted by the private schools. On its face, therefore, Regulation 6458, including Rule 11, is content-neutral, censoring no subject, opinion, or educational philosophy.

As noted earlier, Rule 8 requires private schools to announce the list of books to be used in the next school year, Rule 9 requires them to disclose book prices as well as their agreement with book sellers, Rule 10 requires private schools to inform parents of price changes, and Rule 12 requires them to inform parents of the existence and the application of Regulation 6458.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 11 also provides consumers with information about the cost of private schooling. When schools assign a new textbook edition, Rule 11 requires them to disclose \"which [books] have different editions, what the change specifically consists of, and whether it is a significant change or not, as defined by these regulations.\" R.11. This disclosure requirement provides information about how book costs are determined, which allows parents to determine for themselves which costs of private education they are willing to pay for. The disclosure aspects of Rule 11, therefore, also enable parents \"to make an informed decision about the cost of education in private schools.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, Rule 11's requirement that parents have the option of purchasing the old edition of an assigned textbook is not relevant, much less narrowly tailored, to the achievement of DACO's goal of providing consumers with information. The purpose of that requirement is not to provide parents with information, it is to save parents money. We therefore find that the option requirement is not narrowly tailored to the state's proffered interest in providing information about the cost of private education.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DACO's second goal is purportedly to protect consumers from \"the arbitrary or abusive use of new editions of textbooks that merely contain cosmetic changes.\" Appellant Br. at 50. If this were in fact a problem, we might have some reason to pause in our judgment. However, the district court noted that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[t]he record in this case is entirely devoid of any evidence which suggests that the prices of textbooks are excessive, or that textbook publishers' or distributors' pricing, marketing, or other practices are in any way abusive, unfair or arbitrary. Defendant's only argument proffered in support of its allegation of abuse and unfairness is the fact that text book production and distribution is a for-profit industry. This, without more, cannot offend notions of justice in our free-enterprise system. Further, it appears that Regulation 6458 was promulgated without any investigation, hearings, consultation with education experts, evidence, findings, or any other foundation which demonstrated that the textbook publishers' or distributors['] prices or practices are abusive, unfair, or arbitrary. It also appears that DACO had no legitimate basis to conclude that consumers would prospectively become at risk of such exploitation by the textbook industry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Garc&#237;a Padilla,</i> 408 F.Supp.2d at 77.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, DACO has not attempted to supplement the information it provided to the district court regarding the need for this regulation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> DACO points only to complaints it received from parents regarding \"the excessive costs of textbooks\" in private schools. Appellant Br. at 52-53. Such complaints are insufficient to establish a legitimate state interest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> \"When the Government defends a regulation on speech as a means to redress past harms or to prevent anticipated harms, it must do more than simply posit the existence of the disease sought to be cured.\" <i>Turner Broad. Sys., Inc.,</i> 512 U.S. at 664, 114 S.Ct. 2445 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). DACO must \"demonstrate that the recited harms are real, not merely conjectural, and that the regulation will in fact alleviate these harms in a direct and material way.\" <i>Id.</i> We cannot conclude that DACO has a legitimate state interest in fixing a problem it has not shown to exist. Moreover, because there is no evidence of a problem, DACO's proposed solution cannot be narrowly tailored to it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But even if we were to accept the premise that consumers need protection from \"the arbitrary or abusive use of textbooks that only contain cosmetic changes,\" a further problem remains in that Rule 11's option requirement is substantially broader than necessary for DACO to successfully address this interest. The obligations imposed by Rule 11 are not confined to instances in which a new edition of a textbook contains only \"cosmetic\" changes. As discussed above, many changes considered by DACO not to be significant could qualify as more than cosmetic. For instance, the exclusion of a chapter or section, the addition of one or several sentences to a chapter, section or throughout a book, and the addition of one or several drawings, graphics, tables, or photographs could very well be significant, non-cosmetic changes, depending on their content. Thus, we find that Rule 11's requirement that parents have the option of purchasing the old edition of an assigned textbook does not survive intermediate scrutiny and, as such, violates the schools' constitutional right to academic freedom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In considering this issue, the district court held that Rule 11 is unconstitutional in its entirety. On this point, we disagree with the district court. As noted above, Rule 11's disclosure requirements survive constitutional scrutiny because they are narrowly tailored to the state's significant interest in providing parents with information about the cost of private education. Mindful of our duty to preserve as much of a state law as possible by only severing the problematic portions of the law, we only hold unconstitutional Rule 11's requirement that parents have the option of purchasing the old edition of an assigned textbook. <i>See Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of N. New England,</i> 546 U.S. 320, 126 S.Ct. 961, 967, 163 L.Ed.2d 812 (2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Law 116</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Law 116 provides that \"[e]very private school accredited by the General Council of Education that requires the acquisition of school textbooks to [sic] their students shall have the <i>consent</i> of the Association or Council of Parents or of an Assembly of Parents to determine the maximum budget applicable for each school grade for the acquisition of said books required in each school year.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> Law 116, Art. III (emphasis added). Under the statute, the private schools must recommend a budget for textbooks for each grade no later than May 1 of every school year. <i>Id.</i> at Art. V. \"The private school shall illustrate to the Association or Council of Parents ... the benefits of the recommended budget, and said association shall <i>approve jointly</i> with the school the same.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added). \"The maximum budget approved applicable to each grade for the acquisition of textbooks required in every school year shall be obligatory for each private school.\" <i>Id.</i> at Art. VI.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held that Law 116 imposes restraints on the private schools' right to academic freedom under the First Amendment because it restricts their freedom to determine \"what shall be taught and how it shall be taught.\" <i>See Garc&#237;a Padilla,</i> 408 F.Supp.2d at 79 (quoting <i>Sweezy,</i> 354 U.S. at 263, 77 S.Ct. 1203). We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In requiring private schools to obtain parental consent for the textbook budget, Law 116 significantly limits the schools' ability to choose their own books. Under the statute, parents have the power to set the private schools' textbook budget by withholding consent until the school agrees to a particular budget. This power to set a maximum budget, in turn, restricts the available choices for textbooks because the total price of all textbooks chosen must be within the approved budget. In essence, Law 116 forces schools, at the margins, to choose textbooks according to price, rather than content. This is a significant restriction on private schools' choice of textbooks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As discussed above, a school's selection of textbooks automatically raises First Amendment concerns because textbook-selection implicates the school's ability to convey a particular message, as well as its ability to convey the message effectively. Thus, a restriction on the school's choice of textbooks&#8212;and in particular one as severe as Law 116&#8212;interferes with the private school's right to determine for itself \"what may be taught\" and \"how it shall be taught.\" <i>See Sweezy,</i> 354 U.S. at 263, 77 S.Ct. 1203 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having determined that Law 116 infringes on activity protected under the First Amendment, we must decide the level of scrutiny to apply to the statute. As with Rule 11, the restrictions Law 116 imposes on the private schools' determinations of what to teach and how to teach are restrictions on the private schools' speech. We therefore apply the same standard governing time, place, and manner restrictions discussed above.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> Again, such restrictions are valid if they (1) are content-neutral; (2) are narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest; and (3) leave open ample alternative channels of communication. <i>Ward,</i> 491 U.S. at 791, 109 S.Ct. 2746.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As stated earlier, the test for whether a restriction is content-based is whether the government has adopted it \"because of [agreement] or disagreement with the message it conveys.\" <i>Id.</i> As with Regulation 6458, we see no bias or prejudice toward particular ideas motivating Law 116. There is no evidence to suggest that in enacting Law 116, the Puerto Rico legislature was seeking to promote or frustrate the discussion of any particular message or subject matter. We therefore agree with the district court that this statute is content-neutral. <i>See Ward,</i> 491 U.S. at 791, 109 S.Ct. 2746.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's principal interest in enacting Law 116 is \"to provide the parents of school-age children attending private schools an opportunity to participate in the decision-making process for determining the budget to be spent on textbooks.\" Appellant Br. at 67. The government justifies this interest \"[i]n light of the increasing cost of textbooks that parents have to face each school year, in addition to the school tuition and additional school fees.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming that parental participation in a <i>private</i> school's budgetary decisions is a significant state interest,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> we agree with the district court that Law 116 is not narrowly tailored to that interest, nor does it leave open ample alternative methods of communication. <i>Garc&#237;a-Padilla,</i> 408 F.Supp.2d at 80. As a preliminary matter, Law 116 is substantially broader than necessary to achieve the state's purported interest. There are many ways in which parents can participate in private schools' budgetary decisions short of having veto power over the budget. The power to veto a budgetary decision is quite a high level of participation&#8212;one that, as we noted earlier, may completely foreclose certain textbook options for the private schools. The requirement of parental consent for the textbook budget thus \"burdens substantially more speech and academic freedom than necessary to further [the state's] interest.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Turner Broad. Sys., Inc.,</i> 520 U.S. at 185, 117 S.Ct. 1174).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Law 116 also does not leave open enough alternative channels of communication to survive intermediate scrutiny. As discussed above, if parents do not approve the schools' proposed budget, which takes into account prices for the school's chosen textbooks, the school will be prevented from using one or more of its chosen textbooks. Law 116 may effectively <i>preclude</i> a school from using a particular textbook to teach its students. Thus, Law 116 violates the private schools' right to academic freedom under the First Amendment because it is not narrowly tailored to a significant governmental interest and because it does not leave open ample alternative methods of communication.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the first factor for the imposition of a permanent injunction is satisfied; the private schools prevail on the merits because Rule 11's option requirement and Law 116 have been shown to violate their right to academic freedom under the First Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Irreparable Harm</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the harm suffered by the private schools, we note that it has long been held that \"[t]he loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.\" <i>Elrod v. Burns,</i> 427 U.S. 347, 373, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976). As such, the private schools have satisfied the second factor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Balance of Equities</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The balance of equities in this case also supports the granting of a permanent injunction. Although the district court did not explicitly compare the harms suffered by the parties to this case, it did note a significant lack of foundation for the proffered harms the government was claiming to remedy with the regulation and the statute. It cannot be said that such conjectural harms outweigh concrete harms to the private schools' constitutionally protected right to academic freedom. On this record, the district court's finding that the harm to the private schools outweighs the harm to the government was proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. Public Interest</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final consideration is the effect of an injunction on the public interest. Schools have the extraordinary responsibility of educating our youth. While there is no question in our minds that the government has a substantial interest in our system of education, we must acknowledge that the task of educating is made more difficult by government interference with what schools teach and how they teach it. This is particularly true in the case of private educational institutions, in which parents voluntarily choose to enroll their children, at least in part because of the schools' educational philosophies, methodologies, and reputations. In view of the fact that Rule 11's option requirement and Law 116 are far broader than necessary to ensure that parents are informed of and involved in the textbook selection process of private schools, we find that the public is well-served by the district courts' imposition of a permanent injunction in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm in part and reverse in part, and remand with instructions for the district court to modify the permanent injunction to enjoin only that portion of Rule 11 of Regulation 6458 that requires schools to give parents the option of purchasing the old edition of an assigned textbook.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Affirmed in part, Reversed and Remanded in part</i>.

Justice Powell held that even though the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI prohibited a state from penalizing an applicant on the basis of race, the First Amendment right to academic freedom empowered a state university to take race into account in admitting students when doing so in pursuit of the academic goal of a diverse student body. <i>Id.</i> at 311-19., 98 S.Ct. 2733 Justice Powell relied on the fourth of Justice Frankfurter's \"four essential freedoms\"&#8212;the right of a university to determine for itself on academic grounds who may be admitted to study. <i>Id.</i> at 312, 98 S.Ct. 2733. Justice Powell's academic freedom rationale was later endorsed by a majority of the Supreme Court in <i>Grutter v. Bollinger,</i> 539 U.S. 306, 325, 123 S.Ct. 2325, 156 L.Ed.2d 304 (2003).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Although<i>Shelton</i> was the first case in which the Supreme Court explicitly applied the protection of academic freedom in the secondary education context, traces of the Court's willingness to protect the rights of primary and secondary schools to teach as they please existed as early as 1923. In <i>Meyer v. Nebraska,</i> the Supreme Court declared a state law prohibiting the teaching of foreign languages in private and public schools unconstitutional because no legitimate state interest justified the regulation that \"attempted materially to interfere with the calling of modern language teachers, with the opportunities of pupils to acquire knowledge, and with the power of parents to control the education of their own.\" 262 U.S. 390, 401-03, 43 S.Ct. 625, 67 L.Ed. 1042 (1923).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Two years later, the Supreme Court struck down a state statute requiring all children between the ages of eight and sixteen years to attend public school as unconstitutional noting that \"[private schools] are engaged in a kind of undertaking not inherently harmful, but long regarded as useful and meritorious. Certainly there is nothing in the present records to indicate that they have failed to discharge their obligations to patrons, students, or the state.\" <i>See Pierce v. Soc. of the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary,</i> 268 U.S. 510, 534-36, 45 S.Ct. 571, 69 L.Ed. 1070 (1925).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Finally, in <i>Farrington v. Tokushige,</i> the Supreme Court addressed the constitutionality of a Hawaii statute heavily regulating private schools. 273 U.S. 284, 47 S.Ct. 406, 71 L.Ed. 646 (1927). The Court held that the statute went \"far beyond mere regulation of privately supported schools\" because it \"[gave] affirmative direction concerning the intimate and essential details of such schools, intrust[ed] their control to public officers, and den[ied] both owners and patrons reasonable choice and discretion in respect of teachers, curriculum and <i>text-books.\" Id.</i> at 297, 47 S.Ct. 406 (emphasis added).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Although <i>Meyer, Pierce,</i> and <i>Tokushige</i> were decided on due process grounds, <i>Meyer,</i> 262 U.S. at 401-03, 43 S.Ct. 625; <i>Pierce,</i> 268 U.S. at 534-35, 45 S.Ct. 571; <i>Tokushige,</i> 273 U.S. at 298-99, 47 S.Ct. 406, each was decided in the 1920s, before the Bill of Rights was incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment. Thus, although they do not expressly address a right to academic freedom, these cases stand for the proposition that \"the State may not, consistently with the spirit of the First Amendment, contract the spectrum of available knowledge.\" <i>Griswold v. Connecticut,</i> 381 U.S. 479, 482, 85 S.Ct. 1678, 14 L.Ed.2d 510 (1965); <i>see also Brown v. Hot, Sexy &amp; Safer Prods., Inc.,</i> 68 F.3d 525, 533 n. 5 (1st Cir. 1995)(noting that <i>Meyer</i> and <i>Pierce</i> would probably be decided today on First Amendment grounds).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> There is no doubt of a state's heightened interest in regulating primary and secondary schools<i>See Bd. of Educ., Island Trees Union Free Sch.

As such, the right to academic freedom in secondary education is necessarily more circumscribed than that of a university. However, we need not demarcate the precise boundaries of academic freedom in primary and secondary schools here. Suffice it to say that in this case, the regulation of textbooks implicates academic freedom sufficiently to require the state to demonstrate that the regulation withstands constitutional scrutiny.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Law 116 provides the authority of the \"Association or Council of Parents\" in each private school to approve or reject a private school's proposed textbook budget.

Faced with the prospect of having to teach out of two different books, or worse yet, of having to litigate what constitutes a \"significant\" change, teachers may well decide to keep the old version (if they can find enough copies) rather than choosing the new one for pedagogical reasons<i>See Crowley v. McKinney,</i> 400 F.3d 965, 969 (7th Cir.2005) (noting that litigation over the correctness of a school's decisions \"would be bound to interfere with the educational mission .... not only by increasing schools' legal fees but also and more ominously by making school administrators and teachers timid because [they are] fearful of being entangled in suits by wrathful parents rebuffed in their efforts to superintend their children's education\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> This problem is exacerbated by DACO's questionable competence in the area it seeks to regulate.

The parties' dispute began when Asociaci&#243;n de Educaci&#243;n Privada de Puerto Rico, Inc., a nonprofit private association representing the interests of private primary, secondary, and post-secondary member schools in Puerto Rico, together with certain individual schools (together, the \"private schools\"), filed a complaint against the Secretary of the Department of Consumer Affairs of Puerto Rico (\"DACO\"). The complaint alleged that DACO's Rule 11 of Regulation 6458, entitled \"Regulation for the Disclosure of Information on the Sale and Distribution of Textbooks\" (\"Reglamento para la Divulgaci&#243;n de Informaci&#243;n en la Venta y Distribuci&#243;n de Libros de Texto\"), violates the private schools' First Amendment rights to free speech and academic freedom. The private schools sought a declaration to that effect and injunctive relief. The district court dismissed the private schools' complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. We reversed that dismissal and remanded the case, explaining that the district court had insufficient facts about Regulation 6458's implementation and the resulting burdens and benefits to decide that the private schools had stated no legally sufficient claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the district court entered an initial scheduling order asking the parties to submit pretrial briefs addressing which First Amendment rights are implicated by Rule 11 of Regulation 6458, the nature and weight of the burdens imposed on the private schools, and the strength of the government's justifications for imposing the burdens. The private schools subsequently amended their complaint to add a cause of action alleging that the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico's Law 116 of May 18, 2004 (\"Law 116\"), entitled \"Law for the Acquisition of School Textbooks\" (\"Ley para la Compra de Libros de Textos Escolares\"), also violated the private schools' rights to academic freedom and free speech. The private schools again sought a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, as well as costs and attorneys' fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a one-day trial, the district court found that Rule 11 of Regulation 6458 and Law 116 violated the private schools' rights under the First Amendment, holding that neither provision was narrowly tailored to further Puerto Rico's legitimate state interests. The Secretary of DACO appealed that ruling. After careful consideration, we affirm the district court's judgment as to Law 116, reverse its decision as to Rule 11, and remand with instructions to modify the permanent injunction to enjoin only that portion of Rule 11 that violates the private schools' right to academic freedom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even though Puerto Rico law makes Puerto Rico's Secretary of Education responsible for \"establish[ing] the standards and the requirements that shall be met by the educational institutions that request a license,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 18, &#167; 2113, DACO's Secretary has also asserted authority over the regulation of private schools. On May 1, 2002, DACO promulgated Regulation 6458 with the stated purpose of \"protecting Puerto Rican famil[ies] and parents, and/or tutors who register their minor children and/or wards in the private schools of Puerto Rico.\" Reg. 6458, R.2. Regulation 6458 was also expressly intended \"to define the obligations and responsibilities of schools, bookstores, distributors, and publishing houses in relation to the corresponding processes pertaining to the sale of textbooks.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regulation 6458 imposes several obligations on the private schools. Rule 8 of the regulation directs schools to post on school grounds, by May 15 of the every year, a list of books to be used the following school year. <i>Id.</i> at R.8(A), (B). Under this rule, private schools must also provide DACO and the parents with the list of books, which must include \"a briefing on the book, its title, author, publishing house, edition, and publishing year.\" <i>Id.</i> at R.8(C), (D). Rule 9 instructs private schools to disclose to DACO and parents final textbook prices and any agreement the schools have reached with a book seller. <i>Id.</i> at R.9(A). The schools must disclose on the same notice that \"said agreement or contract will in no way infringe on the parents' right to buy the books in other bookstores, and/or via other distributors or publishing houses.\" <i>Id.</i> at R.9(B). Moreover, \"[t]he school must place the booklist, including a full review, the title of the book, author, publishing house, edition, publication year, and the final sale price in a highly-conspicuous bulletin board.\" <i>Id.</i> at R.9(D). Rule 10 requires private schools to inform parents of price changes. <i>Id.</i> at R.10. Rule 11, the specific provision challenged by the private schools, provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case which [sic] there are changes in the edition, the school will inform [sic] in the book list which of these books have different editions, what the change specifically consists of, and whether it is a significant change or not, as defined by these regulations. In case that the changes are not significant, the school has to inform the parents on said list, that they have the option of buying the previous edition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at R.11. Rule 12 requires schools to disclose to parents the existence and applicability of Regulation 6458. <i>Id.</i> at R.12. Schools must post a notice, in a sign not smaller than eight and a half inches by eleven inches, with a letter size not smaller than twenty-two points, not more than five feet away from a place to which parents can have visual access, and between five and six feet from the ground, containing the following language:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This school has the obligation to inform parents the pertinent process for book sale and distribution in accordance with the <i>Regulations for the Release of Information About the Sale and Distribution of Textbooks</i> of DACO.

Law 116 establishes that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[e]very private school accredited by the General Council of Education that requires the acquisition of school textbooks to their students shall have the consent of [an association or council of parents and teachers of children in that private school] to determine the maximum budget applicable for each school grade for the acquisition of said books required in each school year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Law 116, Art. 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both Law 116 and Regulation 6458 define the relevant books broadly. Under Law 116, \"school textbook\" means \"every text, dictionary, reference textbooks [sic], handbook, pamphlet, or material for study required or suggested by any private school for use of the academic or curricular program.\" <i>Id.</i> at Art. 2(c). Regulation 6458 defines \"book\" to mean \"all textbooks, dictionaries, reference books, handbooks, pamphlets, or study materials required or suggested by a school for the use of their academic programs and/or curricula.\" Reg. 6458 at R.4(H).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the district court made the following findings of fact regarding the implementation of Regulation 6458 and Law 116.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Textbooks are pedagogical tools used on a daily basis to teach substantive information.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> They are also used by teachers and school administrators to develop curricula and lesson plans. Textbooks are widely used in private primary and secondary schools in Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Private schools choose textbooks that are consistent with their particular academic and educational vision, mission, philosophy, curriculum, and methodology, all of which vary significantly among Puerto Rican private schools. In choosing textbooks, private schools also consider significant developments in an educational field, the introduction of a new pedagogical approach, and the availability of the new edition as opposed to the old edition of a particular textbook. Secondarily, the schools also take into account the price and availability of textbooks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The textbook selection process is school-specific. In general, private schools will first evaluate a new edition or series for whether the textbook is aligned with the school's curriculum, mission, vision, philosophy, and methodology, and whether it meets the students' needs. Teachers often make independent evaluations of textbook series or editions based on the above-mentioned criteria. After an initial independent evaluation by individual teachers, the teachers often meet as a group on multiple occasions to determine whether the series or edition meets the criteria. Teachers then share their input with school administrators, who review the teachers' conclusions, sometimes making their own independent assessment of the textbooks. Teachers' input in this process is highly valued by the schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some private schools retain external consultants with expertise in certain substantive areas to advise teachers or administrators about new textbooks or pedagogical methods. Parental participation in selecting textbooks in private schools is typically minimal or nonexistent. At some private schools, parents act as a general sounding board or advisory group, but the ultimate decision of which books are selected resides with the private schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Private schools do not generally change the editions or series of textbooks for all subject areas at once. For instance, one Puerto Rican private school evaluates the textbooks at the rate of approximately two subjects per year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Publishing houses inform private schools about their new textbook series or editions through conferences, telephone calls, and direct mailings of brochures, sample textbooks, and educational kits. Textbook publishers change the edition of a textbook every two to six years. Certain substantive areas are apt to change more frequently than others. For instance, new editions of science textbooks may be introduced by publishers every two to three years, while English textbook editions usually change only every five or six years. Notice of new textbook editions varies generally from one year to a couple of months before a new academic year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After choosing textbooks to be used in the upcoming academic year, private schools create a list of the books selected. Consistent with Rule 8 of Regulation 6458, the schools provide parents with that list no later than May 15th of the previous academic year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The use of two different textbooks to teach a class has in the past resulted in disruption in the classroom. In the 2004-05 academic year, a ninth grade Social Studies teacher at Tom&#225;s Alva Edison School, a private secular school in Caguas, Puerto Rico serving 700 students, decided not to require students to buy the new edition of their Social Studies textbook because the teacher and the school believed that the old textbook edition was acceptable and the changes between the old and new edition were not significant. Because the old textbook edition was out of print, some students were unable to find it and had to buy the new edition. Consequently, both editions of the textbooks were used in the same classroom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two editions were paginated differently, which, according to the teacher, created disruption and classroom management problems. Moreover, the teacher was forced to use cooperative groups to teach some lessons even though the teacher and school administrators did not think this teaching method was appropriate for the subject matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ana Christina S&#225;nchez, the school director of Colegio Adianez, a private secular primary and secondary school with 780 students in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico and the president of the private schools association also had an experience teaching with two different textbook editions before the promulgation of Regulation 6458. Although S&#225;nchez did not think that the changes between the editions were significant, she found that having two editions of the same textbook was disruptive in the classroom, primarily because the same material appeared on different pages. She stated that it was difficult to maintain the students' attention and that a classroom-management problem developed. After a few weeks, she required all the children to purchase and use only the new edition of the textbook.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.

If most of the instruction presented to students comes from textbooks, the knowledge students glean from those textbooks significantly influences their understanding of and perspectives on particular subjects. <i>See</i> M. David Bieber, <i>Textbook Adoption Laws, Precensorship, and the First Amendment: The Case Against Statewide Selection of Classroom Materials,</i> 17 J. Marshall L.Rev. 167, 167 (1984) (arguing that state textbook adoption laws have been manipulated \"to accomplish ideological suppression\" and proposing that states \"return control of textbook selection to local school boards\"). This is especially important in subjects dominated by diverging viewpoints, discussion, and debate, where it is impossible to separate factual from ideological content. <i>See id.</i>; Martin H. Redish &amp; Kevin Finnerty, <i>What Did You Learn in School Today? Free Speech, Values Inculcation, and the Democratic-Educational Paradox,</i> 88 Cornell L.Rev. 62, 111 (2002) (arguing that state control over the public educational process, for example in the selection of textbooks, threatens First Amendment values). Accordingly, the selection of textbooks is an important pedagogical decision because the chosen textbook often represents the student's only source of understanding of these subjects. <i>See</i> Redish &amp; Finnerty, <i>supra</i> (\"By selecting history texts, a school ingrains in its students a particular understanding of American history, and the likelihood that they will be exposed to contrary perspectives is relatively minimal.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 11 interferes with \"what may be taught\" in private schools. <i>Sweezy,</i> 354 U.S. at 263, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105533\"><a href=\"/opinion/105533/sweezy-v-new-hampshire/\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Rule 11 dictates that if DACO determines that changes between textbook editions are not significant, a school cannot require parents to buy the newer edition. The rule thus forces schools to teach using different textbook editions with differing content. In fact, Regulation 6458's definition of \"significant change\" virtually ensures that the private schools will have to allow its students to use textbooks with content the schools do not approve of, either because it includes information that the schools do not wish to teach or because it lacks information the schools would like to teach. For example, a private school may find the inclusion of new photographs and diagrams in a science textbook particularly helpful in teaching a particular concept, and yet Rule 11 of Regulation 6458, by its very terms, would prevent the private school from requiring its students to purchase that textbook because under Regulation 6458, the addition of drawings, graphics, tables, photographs does not constitute a significant change between textbook editions. <i>See</i> Reg. 6458, R.4(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More alarmingly, Regulation 6458 may force schools to teach using books that contain information directly in conflict with its particular philosophy, methodology, or mission. Regulation 6458 provides that a \"significant change\" is a \"historical, technological, scientific and/or cultural change[ ] ... [that] cause[s] the total or partial revision of one or several chapters or sections and/or the inclusion of one or several chapters or sections,\" but not \"[t]he exclusion of chapters or sections\" or \"additions of one or several sentences to one chapter or section or through a new book edition.\" <i>Id.</i> But the exclusion or inclusion of even one sentence or phrase may very well be considered a significant change by a private school for either teaching purposes or in light of the school's academic philosophy or mission. In fact, seemingly minor changes in text may be precisely what makes a book's new edition acceptable to a school and consistent with the message the school wishes to convey. For example, a book may become acceptable by virtue of the omission in a later edition of language found in prior editions. <i>Compare</i> Thomas A. Bailey, <i>The American Pageant: A History of the Republic</i> 579 (5th ed.1975) (describing Jews as \"nerve racked [sic]\"); <i>id.</i> at 6 (referring to Native Americans as \"near-naked natives\"); <i>id.</i> at 55 (referring to a woman fighting back \"with all the fury of a woman scorned\") <i>with</i> Thomas A. Bailey, <i>The</i> <i>American Pageant: A History of the Republic</i> (10th ed.1994) (omitting these phrases). Similarly, the inclusion or exclusion of even two words, such as \"intelligent design\" in a new edition of a science textbook may substantially burden the schools' ability to convey deeply held values to their students. As the district court noted,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The addition or exclusion of a sentence in a new edition of a textbook stating that, `Evolutionary theory should be critically evaluated against other origin theories,' could be imperative to a given private school's academic philosophy. A private school, religious or secular, that supports teaching creationism or alternative origin theories might find that the evolution disclaimer is necessary to achieve that end. Conversely, a private school who wishes to exclusively teach evolution theory might find that the inclusion of a[n] evolution disclaimer undermines the school's philosophy, and conclude that they want to adopt the new edition of a textbook that has excluded the disclaimer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\"><i>Garc&#237;a Padilla,</i> 408 F.Supp.2d at 73.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By imposing restrictions on when a private school may require its students to use a particular book, Rule 11 also interferes with the private school's freedom to determine <i>how</i> it teaches.

In this case, Rule 11 of Regulation 6458 directly infringes on the private schools' ability to communicate information to their students, and as such, we will analyze the regulation as an infringement on the schools' speech. Thus, in determining whether Rule 11 violates the First Amendment, we look first to whether it is content-neutral, because no matter how valid a government's interest in regulating, it generally cannot be pursued by discriminating between particular viewpoints or subject matters. <i>See Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc. v.

We note that in promulgating Regulation 6458, DACO was not motivated by hostility to particular ideas, opinions, or educational philosophies, nor was DACO concerned with harms that might occur from students' exposure to particular information. DACO's interest in adopting Regulation 6458 was to ensure that consumers had sufficient information about textbooks&#8212;whatever the message in the textbook itself&#8212;to make an informed decision about the cost of education in private schools and to protect consumers against harms resulting from \"arbitrary or abusive use of new editions of textbooks that merely contain cosmetic changes,\" harms that would arise independent of any message or teaching that might or might not be adopted by the private schools. On its face, therefore, Regulation 6458, including Rule 11, is content-neutral, censoring no subject, opinion, or educational philosophy. Thus, we apply intermediate scrutiny to determine whether the government's interest is substantial and whether the effect of the statute on speech and academic freedom is no greater than necessary to protect DACO's interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DACO's primary goal in promulgating Regulation 6458 is \"to provide consumers with the information regarding the [sic] textbooks in order for them to be able to make an informed decision about the cost of education in private schools.\" Appellant Br. at 50. We agree with the district court that this is a significant governmental interest. However, \"[t]hat the Government's asserted interests are important in the abstract does not mean ... that the [speech regulation] will in fact advance those interests.\" <i>Turner Broad. Sys.

We must inquire whether the restrictions imposed by Regulation 6458 are narrowly tailored to further DACO's legitimate state interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The unchallenged provisions of Regulation 6458 provide consumers with a significant amount of information about the cost of textbooks. As noted earlier, Rule 8 requires private schools to announce the list of books to be used in the next school year, Rule 9 requires them to disclose book prices as well as their agreement with book sellers, Rule 10 requires private schools to inform parents of price changes, and Rule 12 requires them to inform parents of the existence and the application of Regulation 6458.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 11 also provides consumers with information about the cost of private schooling. When schools assign a new textbook edition, Rule 11 requires them to disclose \"which [books] have different editions, what the change specifically consists of, and whether it is a significant change or not, as defined by these regulations.\" R.11. This disclosure requirement provides information about how book costs are determined, which allows parents to determine for themselves which costs of private education they are willing to pay for. The disclosure aspects of Rule 11, therefore, also enable parents \"to make an informed decision about the cost of education in private schools.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, Rule 11's requirement that parents have the option of purchasing the old edition of an assigned textbook is not relevant, much less narrowly tailored, to the achievement of DACO's goal of providing consumers with information. The purpose of that requirement is not to provide parents with information, it is to save parents money. We therefore find that the option requirement is not narrowly tailored to the state's proffered interest in providing information about the cost of private education.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DACO's second goal is purportedly to protect consumers from \"the arbitrary or abusive use of new editions of textbooks that merely contain cosmetic changes.\" Appellant Br. at 50. If this were in fact a problem, we might have some reason to pause in our judgment. However, the district court noted that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[t]he record in this case is entirely devoid of any evidence which suggests that the prices of textbooks are excessive, or that textbook publishers' or distributors' pricing, marketing, or other practices are in any way abusive, unfair or arbitrary. Defendant's only argument proffered in support of its allegation of abuse and unfairness is the fact that text book production and distribution is a for-profit industry. This, without more, cannot offend notions of justice in our free-enterprise system. Further, it appears that Regulation 6458 was promulgated without any investigation, hearings, consultation with education experts, evidence, findings, or any other foundation which demonstrated that the textbook publishers' or distributors['] prices or practices are abusive, unfair, or arbitrary. It also appears that DACO had no legitimate basis to conclude that consumers would prospectively become at risk of such exploitation by the textbook industry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Garc&#237;a Padilla,</i> 408 F.Supp.2d at 77.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, DACO has not attempted to supplement the information it provided to the district court regarding the need for this regulation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> DACO points only to complaints it received from parents regarding \"the excessive costs of textbooks\" in private schools.

DACO must \"demonstrate that the recited harms are real, not merely conjectural, and that the regulation will in fact alleviate these harms in a direct and material way.\" <i>Id.</i> We cannot conclude that DACO has a legitimate state interest in fixing a problem it has not shown to exist. Moreover, because there is no evidence of a problem, DACO's proposed solution cannot be narrowly tailored to it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But even if we were to accept the premise that consumers need protection from \"the arbitrary or abusive use of textbooks that only contain cosmetic changes,\" a further problem remains in that Rule 11's option requirement is substantially broader than necessary for DACO to successfully address this interest. The obligations imposed by Rule 11 are not confined to instances in which a new edition of a textbook contains only \"cosmetic\" changes. As discussed above, many changes considered by DACO not to be significant could qualify as more than cosmetic. For instance, the exclusion of a chapter or section, the addition of one or several sentences to a chapter, section or throughout a book, and the addition of one or several drawings, graphics, tables, or photographs could very well be significant, non-cosmetic changes, depending on their content. Thus, we find that Rule 11's requirement that parents have the option of purchasing the old edition of an assigned textbook does not survive intermediate scrutiny and, as such, violates the schools' constitutional right to academic freedom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In considering this issue, the district court held that Rule 11 is unconstitutional in its entirety. On this point, we disagree with the district court. As noted above, Rule 11's disclosure requirements survive constitutional scrutiny because they are narrowly tailored to the state's significant interest in providing parents with information about the cost of private education. Mindful of our duty to preserve as much of a state law as possible by only severing the problematic portions of the law, we only hold unconstitutional Rule 11's requirement that parents have the option of purchasing the old edition of an assigned textbook. <i>See Ayotte v.

Under the statute, parents have the power to set the private schools' textbook budget by withholding consent until the school agrees to a particular budget. This power to set a maximum budget, in turn, restricts the available choices for textbooks because the total price of all textbooks chosen must be within the approved budget. In essence, Law 116 forces schools, at the margins, to choose textbooks according to price, rather than content. This is a significant restriction on private schools' choice of textbooks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As discussed above, a school's selection of textbooks automatically raises First Amendment concerns because textbook-selection implicates the school's ability to convey a particular message, as well as its ability to convey the message effectively. Thus, a restriction on the school's choice of textbooks&#8212;and in particular one as severe as Law 116&#8212;interferes with the private school's right to determine for itself \"what may be taught\" and \"how it shall be taught.\" <i>See Sweezy,</i> 354 U.S. at 263, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105533\"><a href=\"/opinion/105533/sweezy-v-new-hampshire/\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

As with Rule 11, the restrictions Law 116 imposes on the private schools' determinations of what to teach and how to teach are restrictions on the private schools' speech. We therefore apply the same standard governing time, place, and manner restrictions discussed above.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> Again, such restrictions are valid if they (1) are content-neutral; (2) are narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest; and (3) leave open ample alternative channels of communication. <i>Ward,</i> 491 U.S. at 791, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112315\"><a href=\"/opinion/112315/ward-v-rock-against-racism/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

There is no evidence to suggest that in enacting Law 116, the Puerto Rico legislature was seeking to promote or frustrate the discussion of any particular message or subject matter. We therefore agree with the district court that this statute is content-neutral. <i>See Ward,</i> 491 U.S. at 791, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112315\"><a href=\"/opinion/112315/ward-v-rock-against-racism/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The government justifies this interest \"[i]n light of the increasing cost of textbooks that parents have to face each school year, in addition to the school tuition and additional school fees.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming that parental participation in a <i>private</i> school's budgetary decisions is a significant state interest,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> we agree with the district court that Law 116 is not narrowly tailored to that interest, nor does it leave open ample alternative methods of communication. <i>Garc&#237;a-Padilla,</i> 408 F.Supp.2d at 80. As a preliminary matter, Law 116 is substantially broader than necessary to achieve the state's purported interest. There are many ways in which parents can participate in private schools' budgetary decisions short of having veto power over the budget. The power to veto a budgetary decision is quite a high level of participation&#8212;one that, as we noted earlier, may completely foreclose certain textbook options for the private schools. The requirement of parental consent for the textbook budget thus \"burdens substantially more speech and academic freedom than necessary to further [the state's] interest.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Turner Broad. Sys., Inc.,</i> 520 U.S. at 185, 117 S.Ct. 1174).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Law 116 also does not leave open enough alternative channels of communication to survive intermediate scrutiny. As discussed above, if parents do not approve the schools' proposed budget, which takes into account prices for the school's chosen textbooks, the school will be prevented from using one or more of its chosen textbooks. Law 116 may effectively <i>preclude</i> a school from using a particular textbook to teach its students. Thus, Law 116 violates the private schools' right to academic freedom under the First Amendment because it is not narrowly tailored to a significant governmental interest and because it does not leave open ample alternative methods of communication.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the first factor for the imposition of a permanent injunction is satisfied; the private schools prevail on the merits because Rule 11's option requirement and Law 116 have been shown to violate their right to academic freedom under the First Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Irreparable Harm</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the harm suffered by the private schools, we note that it has long been held that \"[t]he loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.\" <i>Elrod v. Burns,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109517\"><a href=\"/opinion/109517/elrod-v-burns/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">347</span></a></span>, 373, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109517\"><a href=\"/opinion/109517/elrod-v-burns/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Balance of Equities</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The balance of equities in this case also supports the granting of a permanent injunction. Although the district court did not explicitly compare the harms suffered by the parties to this case, it did note a significant lack of foundation for the proffered harms the government was claiming to remedy with the regulation and the statute. It cannot be said that such conjectural harms outweigh concrete harms to the private schools' constitutionally protected right to academic freedom. On this record, the district court's finding that the harm to the private schools outweighs the harm to the government was proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. Public Interest</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final consideration is the effect of an injunction on the public interest. Schools have the extraordinary responsibility of educating our youth. While there is no question in our minds that the government has a substantial interest in our system of education, we must acknowledge that the task of educating is made more difficult by government interference with what schools teach and how they teach it. This is particularly true in the case of private educational institutions, in which parents voluntarily choose to enroll their children, at least in part because of the schools' educational philosophies, methodologies, and reputations. In view of the fact that Rule 11's option requirement and Law 116 are far broader than necessary to ensure that parents are informed of and involved in the textbook selection process of private schools, we find that the public is well-served by the district courts' imposition of a permanent injunction in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm in part and reverse in part, and remand with instructions for the district court to modify the permanent injunction to enjoin only that portion of Rule 11 of Regulation 6458 that requires schools to give parents the option of purchasing the old edition of an assigned textbook.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Affirmed in part, Reversed and Remanded in part</i>.
