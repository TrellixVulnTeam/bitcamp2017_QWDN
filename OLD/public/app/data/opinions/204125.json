D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                        Lynch, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Ripple*, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     William S. Maddox for appellant.\n     Renée M. Bunker, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nPaula D. Silsby, United States Attorney was on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                        December 28, 2009\n\n\n\n\n     *\n          Of the Seventh Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f           LYNCH,      Chief   Judge.          At   issue   is   the   meaning    and\n\napplication of a 2003 Sentencing Guideline for possessing child\n\npornography, § 2G2.4(c)(2), which instructed sentencing judges to\n\napply the stiffer penalties for trafficking in child pornography\n\ncases \"[i]f the offense involved trafficking in material involving\n\nthe sexual exploitation of a minor . . . including . . . possessing\n\nmaterial involving the sexual exploitation of a minor with intent\n\nto traffic.\"      U.S.S.G. § 2G2.4(c)(2).            The issue is one of first\n\nimpression for this circuit.              The defendant, Mark David Dyer,\n\nprimarily argues that the sentencing judge erred in determining\n\nthat the evidence sufficed to establish he had an intent to traffic\n\nin child pornography under § 2G2.4(c)(2) of the 2003 Sentencing\n\nGuidelines, thus adding a minimum of thirteen additional months to\n\nthe defendant's Sentencing Guidelines range.                     Despite this, the\n\ntrial judge exercised his discretion to sentence below the range,\n\nand sentenced Dyer to sixty months in prison, followed by eight\n\nyears of supervised release.\n\n           Dyer pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography,\n\nin   violation    of   18   U.S.C.   §    2252(A)(a)(5)(B).            The   original\n\nguideline range for the total offense level under possession was\n\nfifty-seven      to    seventy-one       months;     the    application      of   the\n\ntrafficking guideline made it seventy to eighty-seven months. Dyer\n\nargues on appeal that the district court wrongly interpreted and\n\napplied § 2G2.4(c)(2), the trafficking cross-reference.\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\f           He also argues that the district court relied upon ex\n\nparte grand jury testimony to reach its factual conclusions and\n\nthereby violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause.\n\n           We disagree with both arguments and affirm his sentence\n\nbased on the facts of this case.\n\n                                  I.\n\n           The basic facts are undisputed.    On June 4, 2004, agents\n\nof the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) executed a warrant to\n\nsearch the Brunswick, Maine residence of Mark David Dyer.           The\n\nagents seized a computer hard drive and ten compact disks (CDs),\n\nall of which were later found to contain numerous images of child\n\npornography.\n\n           Later that day, Dyer consented to an interview with\n\nSpecial Agents James Lechner and Paul Pritchard.       Dyer told them\n\nthat he owned the computer and the CDs and that no one else had\n\naccess to them.    The CDs, Dyer conceded, contained images that\n\nwould likely qualify as child pornography. He admitted that he had\n\ndownloaded what he estimated to be several thousand nude pictures\n\nof twelve- or thirteen-year-old girls, had saved these images on\n\nhis computer, and had burned them onto CDs.         He obtained these\n\nimages, he told Agents Lechner and Pritchard, either by temporarily\n\njoining subscription-only websites or through the use of the\n\nLimeWire   peer-to-peer   file-sharing   program.    Dyer   used   these\n\nmethods once or twice a week to obtain new pornographic images of\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fprepubescent girls aged fourteen or younger.     When asked about a\n\nnotebook seized during the search, Dyer explained that he had used\n\nit to list common keywords like \"pedo,\" \"teen,\" and \"pre-teen\" that\n\nhe entered into LimeWire to find new files.\n\n           Dyer had used LimeWire for two years and explained his\n\nunderstanding of the program to Agents Lechner and Pritchard.    He\n\nknew, he said, that when he downloaded photographs or videos from\n\nLimeWire, the program saved the files in a \"Completed Folder\" on\n\nhis hard drive. This folder, Dyer noted, was automatically treated\n\nas a \"shared\" folder by the LimeWire software.       Dyer knew that\n\nanything he downloaded would therefore be available for other\n\nLimeWire users to keyword search and download.   He also knew how to\n\nstop the material from getting to other LimeWire users. To prevent\n\nthis file folder from being shared with other users, Dyer added, he\n\nwould have had to transfer the file to another location on his hard\n\ndrive.   He had not done so.\n\n           Forensic analysis of Dyer's computer and CDs revealed\n\nseveral hundred images of what appeared to be child pornography.\n\nWhen the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC)\n\nanalyzed the images at the FBI's request, it determined that Dyer\n\nhad downloaded 952 photographs and four videos featuring known and\n\nactual child victims of sexual exploitation.\n\n           The most graphic of these images was a series featuring\n\na single prepubescent girl.    The NCMEC confirmed, and Dyer did not\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fdispute, that the girl featured in these images was an actual child\n\nand a known victim of sexual abuse.       One of the photographs in the\n\nseries showed an adult male urinating on the young girl.                In\n\nanother photograph, the girl had been posed on a bed naked, with\n\nthe words \"cut me,\" \"hurt me,\" and \"slut\" written across her torso.\n\nThe image also showed someone holding a knife near her vagina.\n\nThis image was saved under the file name \"PTHC, Ultra Hard Pedo\n\nChild Porn Pedofilia (New) 061.JPEG.\"        Dyer had stored the entire\n\nseries featuring the girl in the \"shared\" folder on his computer\n\nhard drive, making it available to all LimeWire users.\n\n          Other files in Dyer's \"shared\" folder had titles such as\n\n\"pthc_kely&camila07 young girls rub pussies together.jpg\"; many\n\nincluded the acronym \"pthc,\" standing for \"pre-teen hard-core,\" in\n\nthe title.\n\n          An August 22, 2007 indictment charged Dyer with knowingly\n\npossessing     child   pornography   in    violation     of   18    U.S.C.\n\n§ 2252A(a)(5)(B).1     On November 28, 2007, Dyer pleaded guilty to\n\nthis charge in the federal district court of Maine.\n\n          The court applied the 2003 version of the Sentencing\n\nGuidelines in order to avoid ex post facto considerations.            The\n\npre-sentence    report   (PSR)   submitted    to   the   district   court\n\ncalculated a total offense level of 25 under the 2003 Sentencing\n\n\n     1\n          The government also charged Dyer with transportation of\nchild pornography but ultimately asked the trial judge to dismiss\nthis count.\n\n                                  -5-\n\fGuidelines.     The PSR used U.S.S.G. § 2G2.4, which applied to\n\ndefendants convicted of possession of child pornography and carried\n\na base offense level of 15, and adjusted the sentence upwards to\n\nreflect a number of relevant enhancements.2\n\n           At the pre-sentence conference, the government argued\n\nthat the PSR should have applied the trafficking cross-reference in\n\nU.S.S.G.   §   2G2.4(c)(2)   and   should   have   therefore   used   the\n\ntrafficking provision rather than the possession provision to\n\ncalculate Dyer's base offense level for sentencing.       The sentence\n\nenhancement under the trafficking cross-reference should have been\n\nimposed, the government contended, because Dyer had manifested an\n\nintent to distribute the child pornography on his computer by\n\nmaking it accessible to other LimeWire users.         Dyer argued that\n\nleaving files on a shared computer folder did not qualify as\n\n\"trafficking\" and that, in any event, there was insufficient\n\nevidence that he had intended to traffic in child pornography.3\n\n           At the sentencing hearing on March 13, 2008, Agent\n\nLechner testified and was cross-examined regarding his interview\n\n     2\n          Specifically, the PSR calculated a two-level enhancement\nfor materials involving a prepubescent minor, another two-level\nenhancement for possession involving the use of a computer, a four-\nlevel enhancement for possession of images involving sadism and\nmasochism, and a five-level enhancement for possession of over 600\nimages.    The PSR also adjusted for Dyer's acceptance of\nresponsibility, resulting in a final offense level of 25.\n     3\n          Dyer also contested the recommended enhancements for\npossession of sadistic images and for possession of more than 600\nimages. He does not, however, challenge these enhancements, which\nthe court applied, on appeal.\n\n                                   -6-\n\fwith Dyer.   Lechner described his role in the search of Dyer's\n\nresidence, his subsequent interview with Dyer, and the FBI's\n\nultimate conclusions regarding the quantity and nature of the\n\nimages of child pornography discovered on Dyer's computer and CDs.\n\nHe testified that Dyer had said during the interview that he\n\nunderstood that the child pornography downloaded onto his shared\n\ndrive would be made available to other LimeWire users.         The\n\ngovernment also introduced Lechner's contemporaneous report of the\n\ninterview into evidence. The report included Dyer's admission that\n\nhe knew how to prevent the files from being shared.   He had opted\n\nnot to disable this feature. Another exhibit displayed the results\n\nof the forensic analysis of Dyer's computer and a selection of the\n\nmore graphic images discovered in Dyer's \"shared\" folder. Dyer did\n\nnot introduce any evidence at sentencing.\n\n          On the basis of this evidence and a Fifth Circuit case\n\ninvolving similar facts, United States v. Todd, 100 F. App'x 248\n\n(5th Cir. 2004), the district court applied the trafficking cross-\n\nreference in U.S.S.G. § 2G2.4(c)(2).    However, it did so on the\n\nbasis of the specific facts of the case and implicitly rejected the\n\ngovernment's argument that any use of LimeWire would automatically\n\nconstitute trafficking due to the program's file-sharing features.\n\n\"Trafficking,\" the sentencing judge noted, included bartering, and\n\nDyer had exhibited an \"intent to traffic\" by knowingly making\n\nimages of child pornography available to other LimeWire users. The\n\n\n\n                               -7-\n\fsentencing judge emphasized the facts essential to this conclusion:\n\nDyer had told Agent Lechner that he knew that any file downloaded\n\nfrom LimeWire would be available to other users; he knew where\n\nLimeWire stored the files he downloaded on his computer, and that\n\nthey could be accessed and downloaded by other LimeWire users; he\n\nknew that he could have moved the file to a different location to\n\nprevent other users from accessing it; and he had used LimeWire for\n\ntwo years, during which he downloaded files and had his own files\n\navailable for download.          These acts, the sentencing judge found,\n\ndemonstrated      an    intent    to   traffic   within   the    meaning   of\n\n§ 2G2.4(c)(2).         The sentencing judge also determined that this\n\nconclusion was consistent with Congress's intention to punish those\n\nwho furthered the market for child pornography more severely,\n\nreasoning that file-sharing was qualitatively different from mere\n\npossession   of    files    on    an   inaccessible   computer   hard   drive\n\nlocation.\n\n            In calculating Dyer's sentence, the sentencing judge\n\nemphasized that Dyer had pleaded guilty to an exceptionally serious\n\noffense that involved the sexual abuse of real children.             But the\n\nsentencing judge also acknowledged that Dyer had received an\n\nhonorable discharge from the United States Navy and was a first-\n\ntime offender who had shown remorse and a willingness to undergo a\n\nsex offender treatment program.          Dyer's total offense level under\n\nthe Guidelines was twenty-seven, which would ordinarily result in\n\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fa prison sentence of between seventy and eighty-seven months.\n\nHowever, in light of Dyer's character and circumstances, the\n\nsentencing judge imposed a below-Guidelines sentence of sixty\n\nmonths in prison, followed by eight years of supervised release.\n\n           Dyer now appeals this sentence.\n\n                                       II.\n\nA.         Interpretation of Guidelines Terms\n\n           Dyer's main argument on appeal is that the facts of his\n\ncase supported only the application of the guidelines pertaining to\n\npossession of child pornography, and not \"trafficking.\"                        The\n\ndistrict court's interpretation of the meaning of an \"intent to\n\ntraffic\"   under   §   2G2.4(c)(2)     and     of    the   cross-reference     are\n\nquestions of law, which we review de novo.                 See United States v.\n\nCruz-Rodriguez, 541 F.3d 19, 32 (1st Cir. 2008).                   We review the\n\ndistrict   judge's     findings   of    fact    for    clear   error,    and   the\n\ngovernment must prove facts essential to sentencing enhancements by\n\na preponderance of the evidence.         Id.        at 31 & n.8.\n\n           The issue before us is not whether mere use of LimeWire\n\nby one who possesses child pornography shows an intent to traffic\n\nsimply because LimeWire is a file-sharing program.                 The government\n\nhas withdrawn that argument and the district court did not adopt\n\nit.   Rather, the outcome of this case depends upon the particular\n\nfacts and not on a per se rule.         Dyer's challenge raises issues of\n\n\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\finterpretation of both \"intent\" and \"traffic,\" but ultimately turns\n\non the facts.\n\n           The      Guidelines   set     forth     a   distinction    between\n\n\"possession\" of and \"trafficking\" in child pornography as those\n\nterms are used in U.S.S.G. §§ 2G2.4 and 2G2.4(c)(2). Dyer suggests\n\na series of limitations on the definition of trafficking, which we\n\nreject.    To define the kind of acts that constitute \"trafficking\"\n\nas   opposed   to   mere   possession,    we     employ   ordinary   rules   of\n\nstatutory construction.      See United States v. Luna-Diaz, 222 F.3d\n\n1, 3-6 (1st Cir. 2000) (looking to the text, guideline commentary,\n\nstatutory context, and use of similar language in criminal statutes\n\nto interpret the meaning of a term in U.S.S.G. § 2L1.2); United\n\nStates v. DeLuca, 17 F.3d 6, 10 (1st Cir. 1994) (holding that the\n\nSentencing Guidelines should be interpreted according to principles\n\nof statutory construction).\n\n           The text of the 2003 Sentencing Guidelines separated\n\nsentencing for the possession and trafficking of child pornography\n\ninto two distinct subsections.         Sentencing judges were to apply\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2G2.2 to defendants convicted of trafficking in child\n\npornography; receiving, transporting, shipping, or advertising such\n\nmaterial; or possessing such material with an intent to traffic.\n\nThis guideline carried a base offense level of 17.                   U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 2G2.2.   By contrast, U.S.S.G. § 2G2.4 prescribed a base level of\n\n\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\f15 for defendants convicted only of possessing child pornography.\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2G2.4, subject to the condition we describe next.\n\n             The condition is that a cross-reference in the possession\n\nguideline, § 2G2.4(c)(2), mandated that \"[i]f the offense involved\n\ntrafficking in material involving the sexual exploitation of a\n\nminor (including receiving, transporting, shipping, advertising, or\n\npossessing material involving the sexual exploitation of a minor\n\nwith intent to traffic),\" then the sentencing judge was to use\n\n§   2G2.2,        the   trafficking     guideline,    instead.          U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 2G2.4(c)(2).4\n\n             As    a    result,   the   plain   language   of    §   2G2.4(c)(2)\n\nunambiguously extended the trafficking cross-reference both to\n\ndefendants who actually trafficked in child pornography and to\n\ndefendants who possessed child pornography with the intent of\n\ntrafficking but had not yet completed the act.                  In other words,\n\nthis trafficking cross-reference, by its terms, could be imposed\n\neven absent evidence that others received child pornography from\n\nthe defendant.\n\n\n\n     4\n          Subsequent amendments to the Guidelines consolidated\nthese offenses into a single subsection, with provisions for\nsentencing enhancements and reductions depending upon the extent to\nwhich a defendant's conduct went beyond mere possession.        See\nU.S.S.G. § 2G2.2 (2004) (Trafficking in Material Involving the\nSexual Exploitation of a Minor; Receiving, Transporting, Shipping,\nSoliciting,   or   Advertising   Material   Involving  the   Sexual\nExploitation of a Minor; Possessing Material Involving the Sexual\nExploitation of a Minor with Intent to Traffic; Possessing Material\nInvolving the Sexual Exploitation of a Minor).\n\n                                        -11-\n\f          The   government   needs    only   to   demonstrate   by   a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that a defendant possessed the\n\nrequisite \"intent to traffic.\" See, e.g., United States v. Jordan,\n\n111 F. App'x 65, 68 (2d Cir. 2004).    Dyer unsuccessfully advances\n\nlimitations, not in the text, on what \"intent\" means and on what\n\n\"traffic\" means.    We, like the Second Circuit in Jordan, reject\n\nDyer's argument that the cross-reference in § 2G2.4(c)(2) governed\n\nonly when the government proved that the defendant actually engaged\n\nin trafficking and did not merely intend to do so.5    We also reject\n\nDyer's argument that the government must show that third parties\n\nactually retrieved and downloaded images from defendant's computer\n\nto show that the defendant had an intent to traffic.\n\n          First we address the legal arguments about the meaning of\n\nthe terms \"traffic\" and \"intent\"; we then turn to whether, in light\n\nof those meanings, the facts sufficed to meet those definitions.\n\n1.        Meaning of \"Traffic\" under § 2G2.4(c)(2)\n\n          Because the 2003 Guidelines do not define the term\n\n\"traffic,\" we interpret this word by looking to its commonly\n\naccepted meaning.    See DeLuca, 17 F.3d at 9.        To traffic in\n\nsomething commonly means [t]o \"trade or deal in (goods, esp.\n\n\n     5\n          While Jordan was an unpublished Second Circuit opinion,\nwe consider it to be persuasive authority since it squarely\naddressed the same argument made by the defendant in the present\nappeal.   See Sec. Ins. Co. of Hartford v. Old Dominion Freight\nLine, Inc., 314 F. Supp. 2d 201, 203 n.1 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (treating\nSecond Circuit unpublished opinions \"at least\" equivalent in\nauthority to law review notes).\n\n                               -12-\n\fillicit drugs or other contraband),\" Black's Law Dictionary 1634\n\n(9th ed. 2009), or to engage in \"the activity of exchanging\n\ncommodities by bartering or buying and selling,\" Webster's Third\n\nNew International Dictionary 2422 (1993).\n\n            At oral argument, defendant argued that mere trading or\n\nbartering of child pornography is not trafficking.                We reject the\n\nargument. We also reject the argument that a defendant must expect\n\nsome    financial    gain    from     trafficking.      In      the   context   of\n\n§ 2G2.4(c)(2), a defendant traffics in child pornography if he\n\nengaged or intended to engage in an exchange or trade of such\n\nimages.    No financial gain or expectation of financial gain is\n\nnecessarily required. See United States v. Todd, 100 F. App'x 248,\n\n250 (5th Cir. 2004), vacated on other grounds, 543 U.S. 1108 (2005)\n\n(noting   that   \"trafficking\"        ordinarily    means    \"both    buying    and\n\nselling   commodities       for    money   and    exchanging     commodities     by\n\nbarter\"); United States v. Parmelee, 319 F.3d 583, 594 (3d Cir.\n\n2003)   (observing    that        \"trafficking\"    under    §    2G2.2   includes\n\nbartering); United States v. Johnson, 221 F.3d 83, 98 (2d Cir.\n\n2000) (same); United States v. Horn, 187 F.3d 781, 791 (8th Cir.\n\n1999) (\"Section 2G2.2 and the cross reference in § 2G2.4(c)(2)\n\napply when the offense involved the exchange or barter of [child\n\npornography], and not only . . . when this material was offered for\n\nsale.\"). These cases confirm that the crucial acts separating mere\n\n\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\fpossession from trafficking involve the intent to share images of\n\nchild pornography with others, irrespective of financial motive.\n\n            This interpretation is also borne out by the legislative\n\nhistory    of   the    1977    Protection       of    Children     Against       Sexual\n\nExploitation Act (Act), which was amended in 1996 to include 18\n\nU.S.C. § 2252A. See Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996, Pub.\n\nL. No. 104-208, 121, 110 Stat. 3009, 3009-26 to 3009-4 (codified as\n\namended in 18 U.S.C. § 2251, 2252-2252A, 2256 and 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2000aa); see also United States v. Sromalski, 318 F.3d 748, 751-\n\n52 (7th Cir. 2003) (finding that § 2G2.2 and related guidelines\n\nshould be interpreted in relation to the harms Congress identified\n\nwhen    passing    this      Act).       Section      2252A     includes     separate\n\nsubsections prohibiting the distribution, sale, and possession of\n\nchild     pornography,    with       a   further      section    prohibiting        the\n\ndistribution of child pornography to minors with the intent of\n\ninducing them to participate in illegal activities.                  See 18 U.S.C.\n\n§   2252A(a)(1)-(6).          For    purposes    of    punishment,      §    2252A(b)\n\ndistinguishes between possession and all other offenses, mandating\n\na maximum sentence of 10 years for possession and a sentence\n\nbetween five and twenty years for all other offenses.                        See id.\n\n§ 2252(b)(1)-(2).\n\n            The rationale underpinning the 1996 amendments, Congress\n\nsaid,     was   that   the     dissemination         and   production       of    child\n\npornography differs from possession because active participation in\n\n\n\n                                         -14-\n\fthe market for child exploitation encourages further exploitation\n\nof children to an even greater degree.          See H.R. Rep. No. 104-863,\n\nat   28-29    (1996)   (Conf.   Rep.);    see    also   United   States   v.\n\nGrosenheider, 200 F.3d 321, 332-33 (5th Cir. 2000) (footnote\n\nomitted) (\"It is clear that Congress established a series of\n\ndistinctly separate offenses respecting child pornography, with\n\nhigher sentences for offenses involving conduct more likely to be,\n\nor more directly, harmful to minors than the mere possession\n\noffense.     Similarly, the guidelines clearly reflect consideration\n\nof whether and the degree to which harm to minors is or has been\n\ninvolved.\").\n\n             Congress further found that child pornography victimizes\n\nchildren not only at the time of actual abuse but each time the\n\nimage is accessed and distributed anew, since \"its continued\n\nexistence causes the child victims of sexual abuse continuing harm\n\nby haunting those children in future years.\"            H.R. Rep. No. 104-\n\n863, at 28. By this metric, trafficking is qualitatively different\n\nfrom mere possession--and warrants heavier sanctions.             It makes\n\nthese images available to new viewers and keeps an image of\n\nexploitation in circulation, and thus may encourage the growth of\n\na market leading to further exploitation.          See New York v. Ferber,\n\n458 U.S. 747, 756-59 & n.10 (1982); United States v. Hoey, 508 F.3d\n\n687, 692-93 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\f            Second, the legislative history unequivocally shows that\n\n\"trafficking\" in child pornography means bartering these materials\n\neven when no financial stake is involved.              In 1984, Congress\n\nexpressly found that the child pornography market was dominated by\n\ncollectors   who    bartered   pornographic   images    to   expand   their\n\ncollections and had little interest in trading for profit.              See\n\nH.R. Rep. No. 98-536, at 16-17 (1984); see also United States v.\n\nMorales-De Jesús, 372 F.3d 6, 11 (1st Cir. 2004) (explaining that\n\nCongress eliminated the commercial purpose requirement because of\n\nthe prevalence of child pornography distributors who shared images\n\nwith each other with no pecuniary motivation).         Concerned that the\n\nAct   was   being   under-enforced,   Congress    amended    the   statute\n\nspecifically to ensure that it extended to these collectors.            See\n\nChild Protection Act of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-292, 98 Stat. 204\n\n(codified as amended at 18 U.S.C. §§ 2251, 2252, 2253); see also\n\nH.R. Rep. 98-536 at 2 (1983).         Because \"the harm to the child\n\nexists whether or not those who initiate or carry out the schemes\n\nare motivated by profit,\" Congress deliberately broadened the scope\n\nof the Act to better serve its purpose.       H.R. Rep. 98-536, at 2-3.6\n\n\n\n      6\n          As we observed in Morales-De Jesús, we consider the\nlegislative history and the congressional findings of prior\niterations of the Act relevant to its present meaning, since \"when\nCongress previously passed related legislation accompanied by\napplicable findings, subsequent legislation was 'presumably based\non similar findings and purposes with respect to the areas newly\ncovered.'\" 372 F.3d at 10 n.2 (quoting Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U.S.\n183, 190 n.13 (1968)).\n\n                                  -16-\n\f               Based on this analysis, we conclude that the district\n\ncourt properly interpreted the trafficking cross-reference under\n\n§ 2G2.4(c)(2) to include situations in which a defendant intended\n\nto exchange child pornography without any commercial purpose.\n\n2.             Meaning of \"Intent\" Under § 2G2.4(c)(2)\n\n               Before the district court, Dyer never used the term\n\n\"specific intent\" to set forth the legal requirements for applying\n\n§ 2G2.4(c)(2), and has waived the argument.                As a result, the\n\ndistrict court did not directly comment on the meaning of the term\n\n\"intent\" as used in § 2G2.4(c)(2).            It rather concluded that in\n\nlight of the specific facts concerning Dyer's use of LimeWire, the\n\nintent requirement had been met.         Dyer raises for the first time on\n\nappeal    the    argument   that   §   2G2.4(c)(2)   requires     evidence   of\n\nspecific intent, but only in passing and without any legal argument\n\nto support this assertion.             This argument is twice waived on\n\nappeal.       We accordingly review it for plain error.         We find there\n\nwas no error of law, and we reject a reading of § 2G2.4(c)(2) that\n\nwould require specific intent to traffic in child pornography.\n\n               This court recently emphasized the challenges in defining\n\nthe term \"intent\" when it is used to denote an element of a crime.\n\nSee United States v. Tobin, 552 F.3d 29, 32 (1st Cir. 2009) (\"'Few\n\nareas    of    criminal   law   pose   more   difficulty   than   the   proper\n\ndefinition of the mens rea required for any particular crime.'\")\n\n(emphasis original) (quoting United States v. Bailey, 444 U.S. 394,\n\n\n\n                                       -17-\n\f403 (1980)).             In Tobin, we interpreted \"intent\" as used in a\n\ncriminal statute prohibiting harassing phone calls by employing\n\nprinciples of statutory construction and looking to plain meaning,\n\nstatutory structure, and legislative history.                         When these indicia\n\nwere inconclusive, we turned to \"general considerations,\" namely\n\nthe principle that for most crimes, \"intent\" ordinarily requires\n\nonly that the defendant reasonably knew the proscribed result would\n\noccur    (general         intent),     not     that       the    defendant     specifically\n\nintended such an outcome as his purpose (specific intent).                             Id. at\n\n33 (citing Bailey, 444 U.S. at 404); see also United States v.\n\nPitrone, 115 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1997) (observing and applying the\n\nrule that when the text of a criminal statute is indeterminate,\n\ncourts should look to context, including purpose, legislative\n\nhistory, and \"background legal principles,\" to discern the kind of\n\nintent Congress had in mind).\n\n               We    then      reasoned      that    this       principle    that    \"intent\"\n\nordinarily means general intent would have less force in some\n\nsituations where the consequences of the action are not necessarily\n\nwrong     or        harmful.          Thus,        when     interpreting        47    U.S.C.\n\n§ 223(a)(1)(D), which prohibits making repeated phone calls to the\n\nsame    number       with      an   intent    to     harass,      Tobin     held    that   the\n\ngovernment must prove the defendant specifically intended to harass\n\nthe    person       at   the    called    number      because       \"[t]here    is   nothing\n\n\n\n\n                                              -18-\n\finherently wicked or even suspect about multiple phone calls\"\n\nabsent the wicked intention motivating them.     Id.\n\n           \"Intent\" has at least two possible ordinary meanings in\n\nthe criminal context, referring either to the fact that a defendant\n\npurposefully and affirmatively desired an unlawful outcome or,\n\nalternatively, to a defendant's reasonable knowledge that his acts\n\nmight result in such an outcome.    See Bailey, 444 U.S. at 403-04.\n\n           The texts of § 2G2.4 and § 2G2.2 are not explicit on what\n\nkind of scienter requirement the Commission intended.               While\n\n§ 2G2.2 pertains to trafficking and § 2G2.4 is predominantly\n\nconcerned with possession, both guidelines penalize conduct that\n\nCongress has deemed inherently harmful.         That the Guidelines\n\nenhance punishment for both actual trafficking and for intent to\n\ntraffic suggests the Commission intended to enhance penalties for\n\nthose whose actions support the market for child pornography and\n\nfor those who should reasonably know that their conduct would do\n\nso.   There is no indication that the Commission intended to depart\n\nfrom the ordinary meaning of the term \"intent.\"      Further, there is\n\nevery reason to think the Commission was, in this understanding of\n\nintent,   carrying   out   congressional   intent.     Certainly,    the\n\nCommission chose not to use alternate language which would have\n\nrequired specific intent.\n\n           The dissent incorrectly argues that the phrase \"with\n\nintent to\" is a term of art that mandates the conclusion that\n\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\f§ 2G2.4(c)(2) requires proof that a defendant specifically intended\n\nto traffic in child pornography.         That argument is undercut by\n\nBailey, which noted that \"the word 'intent' is quite ambiguous\"\n\nwhen interpreting what the court of appeals had meant when using\n\nthat precise phrase.      444 U.S. at 633.      The use of the words\n\n\"intent to traffic\" does not by itself signify specific intent, as\n\nnumerous other courts have found in other contexts.     For instance,\n\n18 U.S.C. § 2320 punishes anyone who, inter alia, \"intentionally\n\ntraffics or attempts to traffic in goods or services and knowingly\n\nuses a counterfeit mark on or in connection with such goods or\n\nservices.\"   18 U.S.C. § 2320(a)(1).     Other circuits have held that\n\nspecific intent was not required for culpability, on the grounds\n\nthat specific intent requirements are not ordinarily prerequisites\n\nin criminal offenses and the legislative history did not support\n\nsuch an interpretation.    See, e.g., United States v. Gantos, 817\n\nF.2d 41, 42-43 (8th Cir. 1987).     Likewise, the Second Circuit has\n\ninterpreted 18 U.S.C. § 479, which makes it a crime to \"knowingly\n\nand with intent to defraud, utter[], pass[], or put off, in payment\n\nor negotiation, any false, forged, or counterfeited\" foreign bonds,\n\nonly as a general intent crime.    See United States v. Mucciante, 21\n\nF.3d 1228, 1235 (2d Cir. 1994).7\n\n\n     7\n          One circuit has also held that 18 U.S.C. § 115(a)(1)(B),\nwhich prohibits threats of assault, kidnaping, or murder against\nfederal officials, judges, and law enforcement officers \"with\nintent to\" inhibit their official duties or \"with intent to\"\nretaliate against them, is a general or specific intent crime. See\n\n                                  -20-\n\f           Indeed, treating such language as per se imposing a\n\nspecific intent requirement runs counter to the careful, context-\n\nspecific weighing of text, structure, legislative history, and\n\ngeneral considerations that we have long employed and is contrary\n\nto our analysis in Tobin.\n\n           The legislative history, in turn, supports a reading that\n\nintent in the sense of knowledge suffices.      Congress described the\n\nevils of the child pornography market by focusing on the child\n\nvictims involved, not by distinguishing between the motives of\n\npurveyors.     Trafficking   in   child   pornography    has   an   equally\n\nhorrific effect upon the children involved irrespective of whether\n\nthe trafficker actively desires or merely knows that his actions\n\nwill likely make images of child pornography more available to\n\nothers.   That Congress eliminated the requirement that traffickers\n\nin child pornography could only be prosecuted if they were acting\n\nwith a commercial purpose underscores Congress' understanding that\n\nsuch conduct is culpable regardless of the underlying motive.          See\n\nH.R. Rep. 98-536, at 16-17.\n\n           We also turn to the \"general considerations\" explained in\n\nTobin.    These considerations strongly confirm that § 2G2.4(c)(2)\n\ndoes not require specific, purposeful intent.           We should instead\n\nrest upon the default assumption discussed in Bailey and elsewhere\n\n\nUnited States v. Ettinger, 344 F.3d 1149, 1156 (11th Cir. 2003);\nbut see United States v. Veach, 455 F.3d 628, 631-32 (6th Cir.\n2006) (requiring specific intent); United States v. Stewart, 420\nF.3d 1007, 1017 (9th Cir. 2005) (same).\n\n                                  -21-\n\fthat an intent to traffic in child pornography, like most other\n\ncrimes, requires only general intent.       Unlike the repeated phone\n\ncalls at issue in Tobin, sharing child pornography qualifies as\n\ninherently bad conduct.        Indeed, Tobin itself makes this exact\n\ndistinction.   Another subsection of the statute at issue in Tobin\n\nprohibited making phone calls if those calls involved content that\n\ncould be considered child pornography, with the intent to harass\n\nanother person.      Tobin stated that this subsection \"involve[d]\n\nsuspicious or even malign conduct\" and concluded that unlike the\n\nprovision at issue, \"intent\" in this subsection meant only \"mere\n\nknowledge of consequences.\"      Tobin, 552 F.3d at 33.8\n\n          Further,    courts    are   ordinarily   concerned    with   the\n\ndistinction between specific and general intent when defining\n\nelements of a crime in order to put defendants on notice of where\n\nthe line between culpable and innocent conduct falls.          See, e.g.,\n\nCarter v. United States, 530 U.S. 255, 268-69 (2000).            No such\n\nconcern applies at sentencing.        Courts routinely interpret the\n\nSentencing Guidelines by looking at related conduct beyond the\n\nspecific elements of a criminal offense, because the purpose is to\n\n\n     8\n          While we have recognized that the crime of possession of\na controlled substance with intent to distribute requires proof\nthat the defendant specifically and purposefully intended to\ntraffic in drugs, that conclusion resulted from statutory language\nthat includes the phrase \"knowingly or intentionally\" and by\nconcerns with overbreadth. See, e.g., United States v. Hassan, 542\nF.3d 968, 979 (2d Cir. 2008); United States v. Caseer, 399 F.3d\n828, 839 (6th Cir. 2005). Both of those concerns are inapplicable\nin the present context.\n\n                                  -22-\n\fassess the severity of the defendant's particular crime in light of\n\nthe surrounding circumstances.                See Witte v. United States, 515\n\nU.S. 389, 402-03 (1995).           In so doing, courts are not punishing a\n\ndefendant for a distinct offense; they are instead evaluating the\n\ntotality    of    a     defendant's     conduct       in   order     to    arrive       at    a\n\nreasonable sentence. See United States v. Amirault, 224 F.3d 9, 15\n\n(1st Cir. 2000) (holding that a sentencing court can look to past,\n\nuncharged    conduct       to   impose    an     aggravated         sentence      for     the\n\npossession of child pornography because such conduct bears upon the\n\ngravity of the possession offense).\n\n            We therefore reject the defendant's argument that the\n\ngovernment       must    necessarily     show     the      defendant       actively       and\n\nsubjectively       desired      that    others    would      get    images     of    child\n\npornography from him and that ordinary general intent does not\n\nsuffice.\n\nB.          Application of \"Intent to Traffic\" in This Case\n\n            We consider the district court's application of this\n\nguideline to the facts of this case to be a mixed question of law\n\nand fact, which we review using a sliding standard of review.                                We\n\nreview predominantly legal questions de novo, while we defer to\n\nfact-driven determinations and review them for clear error.                               See\n\nUnited States v. Sicher, 576 F.3d 64, 70-71 & n.6 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\nThe district court's application of § 2G2.4(c)(2) in this case was\n\nheavily    fact-dependent,        and    we    find     that   it    did    not     err      in\n\n\n                                         -23-\n\fconcluding that Dyer's online conduct showed an \"intent to traffic\"\n\nunder § 2G2.4(c)(2).   We would reach this conclusion even if we\n\nwere to review the district court's application of § 2G2.4(c)(2) de\n\nnovo.\n\n          The Internet, and its capacity to facilitate online\n\nbartering of computer files between collectors and purveyors of\n\nchild pornography, readily links a single computer user to a\n\npossible network of others.    See United States v. Lewis, 554 F.3d\n\n208, 210 (1st Cir. 2009).     It is clear that for there to be any\n\nmeaningful distinction between the crimes of possession and the\n\nenhancement for intent to traffic, more than mere receipt of child\n\npornography on a computer must be shown for § 2G2.4(c)(2) to apply.\n\nSromalski, 318 F.3d at 751-52.   Other circuits have held that this\n\ncross-reference applies to defendants who arranged to exchange\n\nimages of child pornography with others over e-mail or by posting\n\nthese images in an online chatroom.     See, e.g., United States v.\n\nBender, 290 F.3d 1279, 1285 (11th Cir. 2002) (applying cross-\n\nreference to defendant who traded child pornography over email);\n\nUnited States v. Johnson, 221 F.3d 83, 98 (2d Cir. 2000), cert\n\ndenied, 533 U.S. 953 (2001) (applying 2G2.4(c)(2) to defendant who\n\nconceded that he \"sen[t] and received\" images of child pornography\n\non his computer).\n\n          We do not decide whether the use of file-sharing software\n\nsuch as LimeWire per se would have qualified as trafficking under\n\n\n                                 -24-\n\f§ 2G2.4(c)(2).     Our holding centers on the facts of this case.                      As\n\nthe   sentencing      judge     emphasized,      Dyer   chose    to     download      and\n\nfrequently use LimeWire, a type of peer-to-peer software that\n\ncreates a shared system of users, and he did so to acquire images\n\nof child pornography for his personal collection.9                     He downloaded\n\nthese files into a \"shared\" folder that he knew would be made\n\navailable   to   others.         He   did   so    for   two    years    and    gave    no\n\nindication to Agents Lechner and Pritchard that he would have\n\nstopped had he not been arrested.                 He knew how to turn off the\n\n\"sharing\"   feature        of   LimeWire    and    prevent      other     users    from\n\naccessing these features, but he did not, at any point, make an\n\neffort to do so.        By his actions, Dyer took deliberate steps to\n\nbecome    part   of    a    virtual    community        of    consumers       of   child\n\npornography who shared images to enlarge their own collections.\n\nOur holding that these acts showed an \"intent to traffic\" likewise\n\ncomports with the holdings of other circuits on similar fact\n\npatterns.    See United States v. Groenendal, 557 F.3d 419, 423-24\n\n(6th Cir. 2009) (holding that the defendant engaged in trafficking\n\n\n      9\n          We have previously discussed LimeWire's functions at\nlength. LimeWire \"is a peer-to-peer file sharing application that\nconnects users who wish to share data files with one another.\"\nLewis, 554 F.3d at 211.     When a user downloads LimeWire, the\nprogram creates a new folder on his computer where any files\ndownloaded from LimeWire will be saved. LimeWire designates this\nas a \"shared\" folder, meaning that its contents will automatically\nbe available to other users.

App'x at 250 (finding that\n\n\"[b]y downloading the images and making them accessible to others,\"\n\ndefendant      became   eligible        for   sentencing   pursuant      to   §\n\n2G2.4(c)(2)).10\n\n              To be clear, we do not today reach the abstract issue of\n\nwhether any LimeWire user who downloaded child pornography could\n\nhave been sentenced under § 2G2.4(c)(2) because of LimeWire's\n\ninherent file-sharing features and purposes.               Dyer, by his own\n\nadmission, was differently situated from an unwitting LimeWire user\n\nwho failed to realize that by downloading files, he was also saving\n\nthem to a \"shared,\" universally accessible folder on his own\n\ncomputer.       On the facts of this case, the district court was\n\ncorrect to conclude that Dyer's conduct warranted the application\n\nof § 2G2.4(c)(2).\n\n                                    III.\n\n              Finally, Dyer asserts that the district court relied upon\n\nAgent Lechner's testimony before a grand jury to conclude that Dyer\n\nknew that he could have made child pornography files unavailable to\n\n\n     10\n          Moreover, these facts would be sufficient for us to find\nan intent to traffic even if § 2G2.4(c)(2) were read to require\nspecific intent. Dyer's long-term, purposeful use of LimeWire, his\ndeliberate failure to turn off the file-sharing function, and his\nawareness that other users could download child pornography from\nhis \"shared\" folder could reasonably be found to amount to a\nspecific intent to share these images with other users, not just\nknowledge that such a result was the likely consequence of his\nactions.\n\n                                    -26-\n\fother LimeWire users by transferring the files to another location.\n\nThis, Dyer claims, violated his Confrontation Clause rights because\n\nthe grand jury testimony was never part of the record and because\n\nhe had no chance to challenge that testimony during the sentencing\n\nhearing.\n\n            This    argument   lacks    merit,   not    least   because    the\n\nConfrontation Clause does not apply at sentencing.                  See United\n\nStates v. Luciano, 414 F.3d 174, 178-79 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            Further, Dyer failed to raise this argument before the\n\ndistrict court, and any claim would therefore have to rise to the\n\nlevel of plain error to warrant reversal.              See United States v.\n\nAntonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 77 (1st Cir. 2005).                There is no\n\npossibility of plain error in this case. Dyer presents no evidence\n\nthat the district court relied upon Lechner's grand jury testimony.\n\nMoreover, Dyer's counsel effectively cross-examined Agent Lechner\n\nabout    Dyer's    understanding   of   file-sharing     at   the   sentencing\n\nhearing.    Beyond this, the district court's conclusion that Dyer\n\nknew he could have disabled the sharing feature is supported by a\n\nnumber     of   documents   throughout     the   record,      including    the\n\ngovernment's Exhibit A at sentencing.            That exhibit, in fact,\n\nexplicitly summarized Agent Lechner's conclusion from his interview\n\nwith Dyer that Dyer knew \"you would have to physically move the\n\nfile to another location to make it unavailable for sharing.\"\n\n            The sentence is affirmed.\n\n\n\n                                    -27-\n\f-Concurring and Dissent Opinion Follows-\n\n\n\n\n                  -28-\n\f             TORRUELLA,   Circuit   Judge    (Concurring      in    part    and\n\nDissenting in part). I dissent from the majority's conclusion that\n\nAppellant Mark David Dyer (\"Dyer\") was properly sentenced under\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2G2.4(c)(2) for possession of child pornography with\n\nintent to traffic.     I write separately to state my conclusion that\n\n§   2G2.4(c)(2)    requires   specific     intent    to   traffic   in     child\n\npornography and to note that the facts of this case fail to\n\nestablish that Dyer exhibited specific intent to traffic in child\n\npornography.      I join the majority in rejecting Dyer's claim that\n\nthe sentencing court violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront\n\nthe witnesses presented against him.\n\n        I.    U.S.S.G. § 2G2.4(c)(2) requires specific intent\n\n             The determination of the sentence that should be applied\n\nto Dyer's conviction for possession of child pornography hinges\n\nupon an interpretation of the term \"intent to traffic\" within the\n\npurview of § 2G2.4(c)(2). The majority interprets the term \"intent\n\nto traffic\" to require general intent in the sense of knowledge,\n\nand not specific or purposeful intent.              I respectfully disagree\n\nwith this interpretation.\n\n             During the sentencing proceedings Dyer argued that he had\n\nno intention to distribute the images he possessed and that he did\n\nnot have \"an actual intention for anybody else to receive those\n\nimages.\"     The government, on the other hand, contended that Dyer\n\npossessed the images with intent to traffic.               On the basis of\n\n\n                                    -29-\n\fDyer's arguments and taking into consideration the government's\n\nposition, the district court concluded that Dyer's actions met the\n\nrequirements of § 2G2.4(c)(2).1   On appeal, Dyer argues that the\n\ngovernment failed to show that he acted with specific intent to\n\ntraffic in child pornography and the government has not contested\n\nDyer's assertion that § 2G2.4(c)(2) requires specific intent.\n\n          As a threshold matter, the majority claims that Dyer has\n\nwaived the argument that § 2G2.4(c)(2) requires the government to\n\nprove that he acted with specific intent to traffic in child\n\npornography.   The majority's attempt to justify the application of\n\nplain error review in this case fails not the least because the\n\nrecord shows that Dyer has argued that he lacked actual or specific\n\nintent, but because it is clear that the government never argued\n\nthat § 2G2.4(c)(2) requires general intent to traffic.   Thus, the\n\ngovernment never put the district court in position to decide\n\nwhether general intent suffices to apply § 2G2.4(c)(2).         The\n\nmajority therefore errs when it faults Dyer for not developing his\n\n\n     1\n          The majority underscores the fact that the sentencing\ncourt never interpreted the term intent within the purview of\n§ 2G2.4 (c)(2).    The majority also concludes that the district\ncourt did not plainly err when it concluded that Dyer's actions met\nthe Guideline's intent requirements.       In so concluding, the\nmajority assumes that the district court inferred a general intent\nrequirement from § 2G2.4(c)(2).        However, in my view, the\ngovernment's failure to argue that general intent suffices in this\ncase, reveals that the district court interpreted § 2G2.4(c)(2) in\nlight of Dyer's argument that he lacked actual or specific intent\nto traffic.   The district court therefore did not hold, as the\nmajority does today, that general intent suffices to sentence Dyer\nunder § 2G2.4(c)(2).\n\n                               -30-\n\fspecific intent argument, even though Dyer has argued that he\n\nlacked specific intent and the government never claimed that\n\ngeneral intent suffices to apply § 2G2.4(c)(2). I therefore cannot\n\npartake       in    the       majority's          assertion    that       this   court's\n\ninterpretation           of   the   mens    rea    required   by    §    2G2.4(c)(2)   is\n\ncontrolled by plain error analysis.\n\n               The distinction between general and specific intent is\n\nsometimes difficult and at times elusive.                     See       United States v.\n\nBailey, 444 U.S. 394, 403 (1980)(acknowledging the difficulty\n\ncourts face in defining the mens rea required for a particular\n\ncrime and discussing the different interpretations of general and\n\nspecific intent).             But it is critically important in a case like\n\nthis       where   the    sentence     to    be    imposed    on    one    convicted   of\n\npossessing child pornography depends on the state of mind with\n\nwhich he possessed said material.2\n\n\n       2\n          The majority argues that the distinction between specific\nand general intent is not critical in this case because we are not\nconcerned with defining the elements of a crime to separate\nwrongful and innocent conduct. The majority further suggests that\nthe leeway sentencing judges enjoy in considering past uncharged\nconduct bolsters the conclusion that general intent satisfies the\nmens rea required by § 2G2.4(c)(2). I fail to ascertain why we\nshould disregard the distinction between specific and general\nintent when we interpret the mens rea established by the Sentencing\nGuidelines. This distinction is crucial in this case because the\nless culpable conduct of possession bleeds into the more serious\nconduct of trafficking on the basis of criminal intent. Bearing in\nmind that our interpretative task in this case requires us to tread\nthe waters of the \"relation between some mental element and\npunishment for a harmful act,\" Morissette v. United States, 342\nU.S. 246, 250-51 (1952), it is crucial to carefully scrutinize the\nlevel of culpability the Sentencing Guidelines prescribe.\n\n                                            -31-\n\f            A specific intent crime is one \"committed voluntarily and\n\npurposely    with   the   specific    intent     to   do    something   the    law\n\nforbids.\"     United States v. Blair, 54 F.3d 639, 642 (10th Cir.\n\n1995)(internal quotation marks omitted).              It requires more than a\n\nknowing violation of the law.          United States v. Kimes, 246 F.3d\n\n800, 806 (6th Cir. 2001).            The defendant must act with a bad\n\npurpose or with the objective of committing the act prohibited by\n\nthe law.    See Blair, 54 F.3d at 642; United States v. Kleinbart, 27\n\nF.3d 586, 592 n.4 (D.C. Cir. 1994).          In contrast, a general intent\n\ncrime   requires    the   knowing     commission       of   an   unlawful     act.\n\nKleinbart, 27 F.3d at 807. The defendant must act \"voluntarily and\n\nintentionally,      and   not   because     of   mistake,     inadvertence     or\n\naccident.\"    Blair, 54 F.3d at 642.\n\n            The majority provides several arguments to support its\n\nconclusion that the term \"intent to traffic\" under § 2G2.4(c)(2)\n\nrequires general intent. The majority claims that the Sentencing\n\nCommission chose not to use language that would require specific\n\nintent and that both the legislative history of the panoply of\n\nstatutes that criminalize distribution and trafficking of child\n\npornography, and the \"general considerations\" of criminal intent\n\nsupport the conclusion that § 2G2.4(c)(2) requires general as\n\nopposed to specific intent. Regrettably, the majority misapprehends\n\nthe text of the Guidelines, ignores their clear mandate, and\n\nmisapplies the \"general considerations\" of criminal law and intent.\n\n\n\n                                     -32-\n\f               First, the plain language of § 2G2.4(c)(2) reveals that\n\nthe Commission required specific intent in order to find that one\n\nconvicted for possession of child pornography should be sentenced\n\nunder U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2, which is the trafficking Guideline.                 By\n\nemploying the term \"intent to traffic,\" the Sentencing Commission\n\nchose language that has been interpreted by several of our sister\n\ncourts    to    require   specific    intent.   Kimes,    246   F.3d   at   808\n\n(explaining that when Congress intends to create a specific intent\n\ncrime it does so explicitly by employing, for example, the term\n\n\"with intent to\"); see also United States v. Welch, 327 F.3d 1081,\n\n1095 (10th Cir. 2003)(interpreting the Travel Act, 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1952, and holding that by requiring an act with \"intent to . . .\n\npromote . . . or facilitate the promotion . . . of an unlawful\n\nactivity,\" the statute required specific intent or proof that the\n\ndefendant acted with the objective of promoting some unlawful\n\nactivity).      For example, the federal statute that criminalizes the\n\nknowing    use    of   unauthorized    access   devices   \"with   intent     to\n\ndefraud,\" 18 U.S.C. § 1029(a)(2), has been interpreted to require\n\nspecific intent to defraud.           United States v. Ismoila, 100 F.3d\n\n380, 387 (5th Cir. 1996).3            Similarly, in the drug-trafficking\n\n     3\n          The majority errs when it relies on the Eighth Circuit's\ndecision in United States v. Gantos, 817 F.2d 41, 42-43 (8th Cir.\n1987) to argue that specific intent is not ordinarily a\nprerequisite in criminal offenses. The Court in Gantos reviewed a\nspecific intent instruction that defined specific intent as\nrequiring evidence that the defendant knew that his act violated\nthe law and that he purposely intended to violate the law. Relying\non the general principle that ordinarily knowledge that an act\n\n                                      -33-\n\fcontext, we have consistently held that to prove possession with\n\nintent    to    distribute     in   violation     of     21   U.S.C.   §   841,   the\n\ngovernment      must    establish    that      the   defendant     knowingly      and\n\nintentionally possessed a controlled substance with specific intent\n\nto distribute. United States v. García-Carrasquillo, 483 F.3d 124,\n\n130 (1st Cir. 2007); United States v. López-López, 282 F.3d 1, 19\n\n(1st Cir. 2002).\n\n               Additionally, the structure of § 2G2.4(c)(2) and its\n\ninteraction with § 2G2.2 bolster the conclusion that the Sentencing\n\nCommission included a specific intent requirement.                 The Commission\n\nadded § 2G2.4 to address offenses involving possession of child\n\npornography, as distinguished from trafficking offenses which are\n\ncovered under § 2G2.2.         The Commission also directed that when the\n\noffense    involves      trafficking      in    child    pornography,      including\n\npossession of said material with intent to traffic, an enhanced\n\nsentence should be imposed under the trafficking provisions of\n\n§ 2G2.2.       U.S.S.G. § 2G2.4(c)2).          Put another way, § 2G2.4(c)(2)\n\nallows a sentencing court to apply § 2G2.2 to a defendant who has\n\nbeen   convicted       for   possession    of    child    pornography      when   the\n\n\nviolates the law is not an essential element of the offense,\nGantos, 817 F.2d at 43, and mindful of the fact that the criminal\nlaw does not require knowledge that an act is illegal, wrong, or\nblameworthy, United States v. Baker, 807 F.2d 427, 429 (5th Cir.\n1986)(citation omitted), the Gantos court rejected the proposed\nspecific intent instruction. The court thus rejected the proposed\ninstruction on the basis that the statute in controversy did not\nrequire knowledge or purpose to violate the law. But contrary to\nthe majority's assertion, the Gantos court did not hold that\nspecific intent is not ordinarily required in criminal offenses.\n\n                                       -34-\n\fgovernment establishes by preponderance of the evidence that the\n\ndefendant intended to traffic in said material.                          A requirement of\n\nspecific     intent       is    thus       consistent          with     the     Commission's\n\nendeavoring    to     separate         punishment      for       possession        of    child\n\npornography from those offenses that involve trafficking in said\n\nmaterial.     It also guarantees that only those who are more than\n\nmere possessors of child pornography are sentenced under § 2G2.2\n\nand its trafficking provisions.\n\n            Secondly, I disagree with the majority's assertion that\n\na   requirement      of    general         intent     better          comports    with     the\n\nlegislative history of the statutes that criminalize trafficking in\n\nchild   pornography.           In    the    majority's          view,     the    fact     that\n\ntrafficking in child pornography no longer requires proof that the\n\ndefendant acted with a commercial purpose reveals that motives are\n\nirrelevant     and     that         consequently      §        2G2.4(c)(2)       should     be\n\ninterpreted to require general intent to traffic. In pursuing this\n\nargument,    the     majority        conflates      the    actions       that     amount    to\n\ntrafficking in child pornography with the mens rea required by the\n\nGuidelines.    The fact that financial gain or commercial purpose is\n\nnot necessary to convict an individual for trafficking in child\n\npornography informs our interpretation of the term \"traffic\" by\n\nclarifying    the     actions        that    amount       to    trafficking        in    child\n\npornography.       However, this legislative history does not end our\n\ninquiry regarding the mens rea an individual must exhibit to be\n\n\n\n                                            -35-\n\fdeemed to possess child pornography with intent to traffic. We are\n\nhere   concerned        with   whether     the     defendant     possessed      child\n\npornography with intent to traffic, not with whether he was moved\n\nby an expectation to recoup a profit.              The fact that Congress made\n\ntrafficking in child pornography a crime regardless of whether the\n\ndefendant was moved by a commercial purpose is not inconsistent\n\nwith the interpretation that § 2G2.4(c)(2) requires the government\n\nto show that the defendant specifically intended to traffic in\n\nchild pornography.\n\n              Thirdly, in my view, the majority misapplies the general\n\nconsiderations of criminal law when it relies on this court's\n\ndecision in United States v. Tobin, 552 F.3d 29, 46 (1st Cir. 2009)\n\nto hold that § 2G2.4(c)(2) requires general intent.                     Tobin, the\n\nmajority      argues,    allows    this    court    to    rest    on   the    default\n\nassumption or \"general consideration\" that intent in most crimes\n\nmeans general intent.          I disagree.      In pursuing this argument, the\n\nmajority fails to ascertain that although general intent has been\n\nheld sufficient to meet the mens rea requirement for most crimes,\n\nthis general principle is ordinarily applied where the criminal\n\nstatute is silent as to the mens rea required.                   See, e.g., Carter\n\nv.   United    States,     530    U.S.    255    (2000)   (concluding        that   the\n\npresumption in favor of scienter only required proof of general\n\nintent in federal bank robbery statute that was silent as to the\n\nmens rea requirement); Bailey, 444 U.S. at 406-08 (inferring a\n\n\n\n                                         -36-\n\fgeneral   intent    requirement     from      federal    statute      criminalizing\n\nescape    from   federal     custody    in    the   absence      of    language    or\n\nlegislative      history     regarding       the    mens   rea        required    for\n\nconviction).       But where, as here, the plain language of the\n\nstatutory text includes a mens rea requirement, we need not resort\n\nto the general considerations invoked by the majority.\n\n              Although general intent may generally be sufficient in\n\nmost crimes to support a conviction, Bailey, 444 U.S. at 408, we\n\nare dealing in this case with a narrow category of crimes that\n\nrequire a heightened level of mental culpability.                  Therefore, the\n\nprinciple that ordinarily general intent suffices for most crimes\n\ndoes not control our inquiry in this case.\n\n              Finally, the majority errs in its reliance on dicta from\n\nTobin    to   conclude     that   trafficking       in   child   pornography       is\n\ninherently bad conduct and therefore knowledge of the consequences\n\nof such action satisfies the Guidelines' mens rea requirement.                    In\n\nTobin, this court held that a statute which criminalized the making\n\nof repeated phone calls with intent to harass required specific\n\nintent to harass and further intimated that general intent could be\n\nrequired by a different section of said statute that criminalized\n\nobscene calls or calls that involved child pornography.                    552 F.3d\n\nat 33.    The Tobin court was only concerned with interpreting the\n\nstatute's section that criminalized the making of repeated phone\n\ncalls with intent to harass. Therefore, any expressions related to\n\n\n\n                                       -37-\n\fthe making of obscene calls or calls involving child pornography\n\nconstitute dicta that does not bind the court in the present case.\n\nIn addition, the court in Tobin reached its determination by\n\ninterpreting the statute as a whole and differentiating between the\n\nharms posed by the types of conduct prohibited under it.                            The\n\ncourt, however, did not rule that when a statute criminalizes\n\nactions related to child pornography it should be interpreted to\n\nrequire knowledge as opposed to purpose.                 Tobin is therefore scant\n\nauthority for the majority's interpretation that §2G2.4(c)(2) only\n\nrequires general intent.\n\n            In   interpreting      §   2G2.4(c)(2)         I   am    guided    by   the\n\nprinciple that the statute's plain language is the starting point\n\nof our interpretation. Staples v. United States, 511 U.S. 600, 605\n\n(1994)(stating that the language of a criminal statute is the\n\nstarting    point   of     the   court's    interpretation           of   a   criminal\n\nstatute); Carter, 530 U.S. at 271 (stating that the canons of\n\nstatutory   interpretation       require        courts    to   first      examine   the\n\nstatutory text).     As has been seen, by employing the words \"with\n\nintent to traffic,\" the Commission chose language that has been\n\ninterpreted to require specific intent and the structure and\n\npurposes of the Guidelines support this conclusion.                           I would\n\ntherefore   hold    that    in   order     to    sentence      one   convicted      for\n\npossession of child pornography pursuant to § 2G2.4(c)(2), the\n\ngovernment must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\n\n\n\n                                       -38-\n\fpossessed child pornography with specific intent to traffic in said\n\nmaterial.\n\n     II. The facts are insufficient to conclude Dyer exhibited\n                     specific intent to traffic\n\n            Although   the   term    \"traffic\"     is   not   defined   in     the\n\nGuidelines, it encompasses both buying and selling commodities for\n\nmoney or exchanging commodities by barter.              See United States v.\n\nPaul, 274 F.3d 155, 163 (5th Cir. 2001).          Evidence that a defendant\n\ntraded pictures online or sent and received images via the Internet\n\nhas been found sufficient to constitute trafficking under § 2G2.4\n\n(c)(2).     United States v. Bender, 290 F.3d 1279, 1285 (11th Cir.\n\n2002)(convicted defendant admitted that he had traded pictures\n\nonline, and the evidence showed that he had sent child pornographic\n\nimages to other users online); United States v. Johnson, 221 F.3d\n\n83, 98 (2d Cir. 2000)(finding that trafficking occurred where\n\ndefendant admitted he sent and received child pornography over the\n\nInternet). Trafficking has also been found where the defendant not\n\nonly downloaded child pornography onto his computer, but also\n\nuploaded child pornographic images in order to join a pornographic\n\nwebsite, United States v. Groenendal, 557 F.3d 419, 421; 424 (6th\n\nCir. 2009), and where defendant admitted he traded pornography over\n\nthe Internet and the evidence showed he sent explicit photographs\n\nto   another   individual    and    agreed   to   exchange    videos    with   an\n\nundercover agent,      United States v. Jordan, 111 Fed. Appx. 65, 68\n\n(2d Cir. 2004).\n\n                                     -39-\n\f           These cases show that in order to find that a defendant\n\ntrafficked in child pornography, the government must prove that the\n\ndefendant engaged in affirmative actions to exchange or barter in\n\nchild pornography.       These actions include, for example, receiving\n\nand sending child pornography.        See United States v. Parmelee, 319\n\nF.3d 583, 594 (applying § 2G2.4(c)(2) to a defendant convicted for\n\npossession of child pornography where the evidence established that\n\ndefendant stored pornographic images on recordable compact discs\n\nwhich he intended to barter with other people for programs or\n\nservices).\n\n           The facts of this case show that Dyer used the file-\n\nsharing application LimeWire to download child pornography; he knew\n\nthat   when   files   were      downloaded    from   LimeWire   the    program\n\nautomatically    saved    the    files   in   a   shared   folder     that   was\n\npotentially available to other users; and he failed to remove the\n\nfiles to make them unavailable for sharing.           It is thus clear that\n\nDyer knowingly downloaded child pornography through LimeWire and\n\nthat he understood that LimeWire automatically saves images in a\n\nshared folder.    But these actions do not show he purposely sought\n\nto trade, exchange, or barter in child pornography or that he\n\nspecifically intended to engage in the sort of activities that have\n\nbeen held to amount to trafficking in child pornography.\n\n           The critical factor to discern whether Dyer intended to\n\ntraffic child pornography via LimeWire is not whether he had\n\n\n\n                                     -40-\n\fknowledge of how LimeWire works in terms of file-sharing, but\n\nrather whether by using LimeWire to download child pornography Dyer\n\nintended to traffic in said items.     We lack proof that Dyer used\n\nLimeWire with the objective of offering the images for barter or\n\nexchange with others.   We similarly lack evidence that Dyer sought\n\nto engage in an active exchange of images of child pornography with\n\nthe purpose to receive further images in return.     Moreover, the\n\nevidence actually established that Dyer had not traded any images\n\nover the Internet via e-mail, chat-rooms, bulletin boards, or\n\nnewsgroups.\n\n          Absent proof that Dyer allowed LimeWire to keep images in\n\na shared folder with the purpose of engaging in an exchange of\n\nimages, I cannot partake in the majority's conclusion that the\n\nsentencing court properly applied § 2G2.4(c)(2).    Specific intent\n\nin this case is inextricably bound to affirmative actions to\n\ntraffic in child pornography.    In my view, use of LimeWire with\n\nknowledge of its automatic file-sharing features and Dyer's failure\n\nto disable the sharing feature is insufficient to conclude that\n\nDyer exhibited specific intent to traffic absent evidence that he\n\ntook additional actions to offer the images for exchange with the\n\nexpectation that he would receive further commodities in return.\n\n          I also note my concern with the majority's efforts to\n\nequate intent to share with intent to traffic.        Although the\n\nmajority claims it is not holding that mere use of LimeWire amounts\n\n\n\n                                -41-\n\fto trafficking in child pornography, its interpretation that the\n\n\"crucial acts separating possession from trafficking involve intent\n\nto share images of child pornography with others,\" threatens to do\n\njust that.        While use of a file-sharing program may provide\n\ncircumstantial evidence of intent to traffic, a finding that there\n\nis specific intent to traffic requires more than knowing use of a\n\nfile-sharing      program.     It   requires      proof   that   the   defendant\n\nintended to engage in an exchange of commodities or goods with the\n\nexpectation to receive some type of commodity in return.                        The\n\ninference that sharing is tantamount to trafficking lowers the\n\nthreshold    of   the   actions     that   have    been   held   to    amount    to\n\ntrafficking and leads to the imposition of criminal liability for\n\ntrafficking where the user has not exchanged commodities by barter.\n\n            For   these    reasons,   I    respectfully     dissent     from    the\n\ndetermination that Dyer was correctly sentenced under § 2G2.4\n\n(c)(2).\n\n                          III. Confrontation Clause\n\n            Finally, I join the majority in rejecting Dyer's claim\n\nthat the sentencing court relied on Agent Lechner's grand jury\n\ntestimony, thereby depriving Dyer of his right to cross-examine\n\nAgent Lechner regarding his grand jury testimony.                     We have to\n\nevaluate this claim under the plain error standard of review\n\nbecause Dyer failed to raise the Confrontation Clause issue before\n\nthe district court. United States v. González-Castillo, 562 F.3d\n\n\n                                      -42-\n\f80, 82 (1st Cir. 2009).           As the majority states, there is no\n\nevidence   in   the   record     that    the   sentencing   court   relied   on\n\nLechner's grand jury testimony without allowing Dyer to elucidate\n\nthis testimony at sentencing.           Absent an obvious or clear error by\n\nthe sentencing court, Dyer's claim that the sentencing court\n\ndeprived him of his right to confront Agent Lechner regarding his\n\ngrand jury testimony must therefore fail.\n\n                               IV. Conclusions\n\n           I    dissent   from    the    majority's   conclusion    that     the\n\ndistrict court properly sentenced Dyer pursuant to § 2G2.4(c)(2).\n\nI would hold that § 2G2.4(c)(2) requires specific intent to traffic\n\nand that the facts of this case fail to show that Dyer exhibited\n\nspecific intent to traffic in child pornography.             I concur in the\n\ndetermination that the district court did not violate Dyer's Sixth\n\nAmendment right to confront the witnesses presented against him.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -43-\n\f",

D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                        Lynch, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Ripple*, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     William S. Maddox for appellant.\n     Renée M. Bunker, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nPaula D. Silsby, United States Attorney was on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                        December 28, 2009\n\n\n\n\n     *\n          Of the Seventh Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f           LYNCH,      Chief   Judge.          At   issue   is   the   meaning    and\n\napplication of a 2003 Sentencing Guideline for possessing child\n\npornography, § 2G2.4(c)(2), which instructed sentencing judges to\n\napply the stiffer penalties for trafficking in child pornography\n\ncases \"[i]f the offense involved trafficking in material involving\n\nthe sexual exploitation of a minor . . . including . . . possessing\n\nmaterial involving the sexual exploitation of a minor with intent\n\nto traffic.\"      U.S.S.G. § 2G2.4(c)(2).            The issue is one of first\n\nimpression for this circuit.              The defendant, Mark David Dyer,\n\nprimarily argues that the sentencing judge erred in determining\n\nthat the evidence sufficed to establish he had an intent to traffic\n\nin child pornography under § 2G2.4(c)(2) of the 2003 Sentencing\n\nGuidelines, thus adding a minimum of thirteen additional months to\n\nthe defendant's Sentencing Guidelines range.                     Despite this, the\n\ntrial judge exercised his discretion to sentence below the range,\n\nand sentenced Dyer to sixty months in prison, followed by eight\n\nyears of supervised release.\n\n           Dyer pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography,\n\nin   violation    of   18   U.S.C.   §    2252(A)(a)(5)(B).            The   original\n\nguideline range for the total offense level under possession was\n\nfifty-seven      to    seventy-one       months;     the    application      of   the\n\ntrafficking guideline made it seventy to eighty-seven months. Dyer\n\nargues on appeal that the district court wrongly interpreted and\n\napplied § 2G2.4(c)(2), the trafficking cross-reference.\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\f           He also argues that the district court relied upon ex\n\nparte grand jury testimony to reach its factual conclusions and\n\nthereby violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause.\n\n           We disagree with both arguments and affirm his sentence\n\nbased on the facts of this case.\n\n                                  I.\n\n           The basic facts are undisputed.    On June 4, 2004, agents\n\nof the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) executed a warrant to\n\nsearch the Brunswick, Maine residence of Mark David Dyer.           The\n\nagents seized a computer hard drive and ten compact disks (CDs),\n\nall of which were later found to contain numerous images of child\n\npornography.\n\n           Later that day, Dyer consented to an interview with\n\nSpecial Agents James Lechner and Paul Pritchard.       Dyer told them\n\nthat he owned the computer and the CDs and that no one else had\n\naccess to them.    The CDs, Dyer conceded, contained images that\n\nwould likely qualify as child pornography. He admitted that he had\n\ndownloaded what he estimated to be several thousand nude pictures\n\nof twelve- or thirteen-year-old girls, had saved these images on\n\nhis computer, and had burned them onto CDs.         He obtained these\n\nimages, he told Agents Lechner and Pritchard, either by temporarily\n\njoining subscription-only websites or through the use of the\n\nLimeWire   peer-to-peer   file-sharing   program.    Dyer   used   these\n\nmethods once or twice a week to obtain new pornographic images of\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fprepubescent girls aged fourteen or younger.     When asked about a\n\nnotebook seized during the search, Dyer explained that he had used\n\nit to list common keywords like \"pedo,\" \"teen,\" and \"pre-teen\" that\n\nhe entered into LimeWire to find new files.\n\n           Dyer had used LimeWire for two years and explained his\n\nunderstanding of the program to Agents Lechner and Pritchard.    He\n\nknew, he said, that when he downloaded photographs or videos from\n\nLimeWire, the program saved the files in a \"Completed Folder\" on\n\nhis hard drive. This folder, Dyer noted, was automatically treated\n\nas a \"shared\" folder by the LimeWire software.       Dyer knew that\n\nanything he downloaded would therefore be available for other\n\nLimeWire users to keyword search and download.   He also knew how to\n\nstop the material from getting to other LimeWire users. To prevent\n\nthis file folder from being shared with other users, Dyer added, he\n\nwould have had to transfer the file to another location on his hard\n\ndrive.   He had not done so.\n\n           Forensic analysis of Dyer's computer and CDs revealed\n\nseveral hundred images of what appeared to be child pornography.\n\nWhen the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC)\n\nanalyzed the images at the FBI's request, it determined that Dyer\n\nhad downloaded 952 photographs and four videos featuring known and\n\nactual child victims of sexual exploitation.\n\n           The most graphic of these images was a series featuring\n\na single prepubescent girl.    The NCMEC confirmed, and Dyer did not\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fdispute, that the girl featured in these images was an actual child\n\nand a known victim of sexual abuse.       One of the photographs in the\n\nseries showed an adult male urinating on the young girl.                In\n\nanother photograph, the girl had been posed on a bed naked, with\n\nthe words \"cut me,\" \"hurt me,\" and \"slut\" written across her torso.\n\nThe image also showed someone holding a knife near her vagina.\n\nThis image was saved under the file name \"PTHC, Ultra Hard Pedo\n\nChild Porn Pedofilia (New) 061.JPEG.\"        Dyer had stored the entire\n\nseries featuring the girl in the \"shared\" folder on his computer\n\nhard drive, making it available to all LimeWire users.\n\n          Other files in Dyer's \"shared\" folder had titles such as\n\n\"pthc_kely&camila07 young girls rub pussies together.jpg\"; many\n\nincluded the acronym \"pthc,\" standing for \"pre-teen hard-core,\" in\n\nthe title.\n\n          An August 22, 2007 indictment charged Dyer with knowingly\n\npossessing     child   pornography   in    violation     of   18    U.S.C.\n\n§ 2252A(a)(5)(B).1     On November 28, 2007, Dyer pleaded guilty to\n\nthis charge in the federal district court of Maine.\n\n          The court applied the 2003 version of the Sentencing\n\nGuidelines in order to avoid ex post facto considerations.            The\n\npre-sentence    report   (PSR)   submitted    to   the   district   court\n\ncalculated a total offense level of 25 under the 2003 Sentencing\n\n\n     1\n          The government also charged Dyer with transportation of\nchild pornography but ultimately asked the trial judge to dismiss\nthis count.\n\n                                  -5-\n\fGuidelines.     The PSR used U.S.S.G. § 2G2.4, which applied to\n\ndefendants convicted of possession of child pornography and carried\n\na base offense level of 15, and adjusted the sentence upwards to\n\nreflect a number of relevant enhancements.2\n\n           At the pre-sentence conference, the government argued\n\nthat the PSR should have applied the trafficking cross-reference in\n\nU.S.S.G.   §   2G2.4(c)(2)   and   should   have   therefore   used   the\n\ntrafficking provision rather than the possession provision to\n\ncalculate Dyer's base offense level for sentencing.       The sentence\n\nenhancement under the trafficking cross-reference should have been\n\nimposed, the government contended, because Dyer had manifested an\n\nintent to distribute the child pornography on his computer by\n\nmaking it accessible to other LimeWire users.         Dyer argued that\n\nleaving files on a shared computer folder did not qualify as\n\n\"trafficking\" and that, in any event, there was insufficient\n\nevidence that he had intended to traffic in child pornography.3\n\n           At the sentencing hearing on March 13, 2008, Agent\n\nLechner testified and was cross-examined regarding his interview\n\n     2\n          Specifically, the PSR calculated a two-level enhancement\nfor materials involving a prepubescent minor, another two-level\nenhancement for possession involving the use of a computer, a four-\nlevel enhancement for possession of images involving sadism and\nmasochism, and a five-level enhancement for possession of over 600\nimages.    The PSR also adjusted for Dyer's acceptance of\nresponsibility, resulting in a final offense level of 25.\n     3\n          Dyer also contested the recommended enhancements for\npossession of sadistic images and for possession of more than 600\nimages. He does not, however, challenge these enhancements, which\nthe court applied, on appeal.\n\n                                   -6-\n\fwith Dyer.   Lechner described his role in the search of Dyer's\n\nresidence, his subsequent interview with Dyer, and the FBI's\n\nultimate conclusions regarding the quantity and nature of the\n\nimages of child pornography discovered on Dyer's computer and CDs.\n\nHe testified that Dyer had said during the interview that he\n\nunderstood that the child pornography downloaded onto his shared\n\ndrive would be made available to other LimeWire users.         The\n\ngovernment also introduced Lechner's contemporaneous report of the\n\ninterview into evidence. The report included Dyer's admission that\n\nhe knew how to prevent the files from being shared.   He had opted\n\nnot to disable this feature. Another exhibit displayed the results\n\nof the forensic analysis of Dyer's computer and a selection of the\n\nmore graphic images discovered in Dyer's \"shared\" folder. Dyer did\n\nnot introduce any evidence at sentencing.\n\n          On the basis of this evidence and a Fifth Circuit case\n\ninvolving similar facts, United States v. Todd, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. App'x</span> <span class=\"page\">248</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(5th Cir. 2004), the district court applied the trafficking cross-\n\nreference in U.S.S.G. § 2G2.4(c)(2).    However, it did so on the\n\nbasis of the specific facts of the case and implicitly rejected the\n\ngovernment's argument that any use of LimeWire would automatically\n\nconstitute trafficking due to the program's file-sharing features.\n\n\"Trafficking,\" the sentencing judge noted, included bartering, and\n\nDyer had exhibited an \"intent to traffic\" by knowingly making\n\nimages of child pornography available to other LimeWire users. The\n\n\n\n                               -7-\n\fsentencing judge emphasized the facts essential to this conclusion:\n\nDyer had told Agent Lechner that he knew that any file downloaded\n\nfrom LimeWire would be available to other users; he knew where\n\nLimeWire stored the files he downloaded on his computer, and that\n\nthey could be accessed and downloaded by other LimeWire users; he\n\nknew that he could have moved the file to a different location to\n\nprevent other users from accessing it; and he had used LimeWire for\n\ntwo years, during which he downloaded files and had his own files\n\navailable for download.          These acts, the sentencing judge found,\n\ndemonstrated      an    intent    to   traffic   within   the    meaning   of\n\n§ 2G2.4(c)(2).         The sentencing judge also determined that this\n\nconclusion was consistent with Congress's intention to punish those\n\nwho furthered the market for child pornography more severely,\n\nreasoning that file-sharing was qualitatively different from mere\n\npossession   of    files    on    an   inaccessible   computer   hard   drive\n\nlocation.\n\n            In calculating Dyer's sentence, the sentencing judge\n\nemphasized that Dyer had pleaded guilty to an exceptionally serious\n\noffense that involved the sexual abuse of real children.             But the\n\nsentencing judge also acknowledged that Dyer had received an\n\nhonorable discharge from the United States Navy and was a first-\n\ntime offender who had shown remorse and a willingness to undergo a\n\nsex offender treatment program.          Dyer's total offense level under\n\nthe Guidelines was twenty-seven, which would ordinarily result in\n\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fa prison sentence of between seventy and eighty-seven months.\n\nHowever, in light of Dyer's character and circumstances, the\n\nsentencing judge imposed a below-Guidelines sentence of sixty\n\nmonths in prison, followed by eight years of supervised release.\n\n           Dyer now appeals this sentence.\n\n                                       II.\n\nA.         Interpretation of Guidelines Terms\n\n           Dyer's main argument on appeal is that the facts of his\n\ncase supported only the application of the guidelines pertaining to\n\npossession of child pornography, and not \"trafficking.\"                        The\n\ndistrict court's interpretation of the meaning of an \"intent to\n\ntraffic\"   under   §   2G2.4(c)(2)     and     of    the   cross-reference     are\n\nquestions of law, which we review de novo.                 See United States v.\n\nCruz-Rodriguez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203469\"><a href=\"/opinion/203469/united-states-v-cruz-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 32 (1st Cir. 2008).

Id.        at 31 & n.8.\n\n           The issue before us is not whether mere use of LimeWire\n\nby one who possesses child pornography shows an intent to traffic\n\nsimply because LimeWire is a file-sharing program.                 The government\n\nhas withdrawn that argument and the district court did not adopt\n\nit.   Rather, the outcome of this case depends upon the particular\n\nfacts and not on a per se rule.         Dyer's challenge raises issues of\n\n\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\finterpretation of both \"intent\" and \"traffic,\" but ultimately turns\n\non the facts.\n\n           The      Guidelines   set     forth     a   distinction    between\n\n\"possession\" of and \"trafficking\" in child pornography as those\n\nterms are used in U.S.S.G. §§ 2G2.4 and 2G2.4(c)(2). Dyer suggests\n\na series of limitations on the definition of trafficking, which we\n\nreject.    To define the kind of acts that constitute \"trafficking\"\n\nas   opposed   to   mere   possession,    we     employ   ordinary   rules   of\n\nstatutory construction.      See United States v.

Sentencing judges were to apply\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2G2.2 to defendants convicted of trafficking in child\n\npornography; receiving, transporting, shipping, or advertising such\n\nmaterial; or possessing such material with an intent to traffic.\n\nThis guideline carried a base offense level of 17.                   U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 2G2.2.   By contrast, U.S.S.G. § 2G2.4 prescribed a base level of\n\n\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\f15 for defendants convicted only of possessing child pornography.\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2G2.4, subject to the condition we describe next.\n\n             The condition is that a cross-reference in the possession\n\nguideline, § 2G2.4(c)(2), mandated that \"[i]f the offense involved\n\ntrafficking in material involving the sexual exploitation of a\n\nminor (including receiving, transporting, shipping, advertising, or\n\npossessing material involving the sexual exploitation of a minor\n\nwith intent to traffic),\" then the sentencing judge was to use\n\n§   2G2.2,        the   trafficking     guideline,    instead.          U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 2G2.4(c)(2).4\n\n             As    a    result,   the   plain   language   of    §   2G2.4(c)(2)\n\nunambiguously extended the trafficking cross-reference both to\n\ndefendants who actually trafficked in child pornography and to\n\ndefendants who possessed child pornography with the intent of\n\ntrafficking but had not yet completed the act.                  In other words,\n\nthis trafficking cross-reference, by its terms, could be imposed\n\neven absent evidence that others received child pornography from\n\nthe defendant.\n\n\n\n     4\n          Subsequent amendments to the Guidelines consolidated\nthese offenses into a single subsection, with provisions for\nsentencing enhancements and reductions depending upon the extent to\nwhich a defendant's conduct went beyond mere possession.

As a result, the\n\ndistrict court did not directly comment on the meaning of the term\n\n\"intent\" as used in § 2G2.4(c)(2).

While\n\n§ 2G2.2 pertains to trafficking and § 2G2.4 is predominantly\n\nconcerned with possession, both guidelines penalize conduct that\n\nCongress has deemed inherently harmful.         That the Guidelines\n\nenhance punishment for both actual trafficking and for intent to\n\ntraffic suggests the Commission intended to enhance penalties for\n\nthose whose actions support the market for child pornography and\n\nfor those who should reasonably know that their conduct would do\n\nso.   There is no indication that the Commission intended to depart\n\nfrom the ordinary meaning of the term \"intent.\"      Further, there is\n\nevery reason to think the Commission was, in this understanding of\n\nintent,   carrying   out   congressional   intent.     Certainly,    the\n\nCommission chose not to use alternate language which would have\n\nrequired specific intent.\n\n           The dissent incorrectly argues that the phrase \"with\n\nintent to\" is a term of art that mandates the conclusion that\n\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\f§ 2G2.4(c)(2) requires proof that a defendant specifically intended\n\nto traffic in child pornography.         That argument is undercut by\n\nBailey, which noted that \"the word 'intent' is quite ambiguous\"\n\nwhen interpreting what the court of appeals had meant when using\n\nthat precise phrase.      444 U.S. at 633.      The use of the words\n\n\"intent to traffic\" does not by itself signify specific intent, as\n\nnumerous other courts have found in other contexts.     For instance,\n\n18 U.S.C. § 2320 punishes anyone who, inter alia, \"intentionally\n\ntraffics or attempts to traffic in goods or services and knowingly\n\nuses a counterfeit mark on or in connection with such goods or\n\nservices.\"   18 U.S.C. § 2320(a)(1).     Other circuits have held that\n\nspecific intent was not required for culpability, on the grounds\n\nthat specific intent requirements are not ordinarily prerequisites\n\nin criminal offenses and the legislative history did not support\n\nsuch an interpretation.    See, e.g., United States v. Gantos, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"487251\"><a href=\"/opinion/487251/united-states-v-lawrence-j-gantos/\"><span class=\"volume\">817</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 42-43 (8th Cir. 1987).     Likewise, the Second Circuit has\n\ninterpreted 18 U.S.C. § 479, which makes it a crime to \"knowingly\n\nand with intent to defraud, utter[], pass[], or put off, in payment\n\nor negotiation, any false, forged, or counterfeited\" foreign bonds,\n\nonly as a general intent crime.    See United States v.

See\n\n                                  -20-\n\f           Indeed, treating such language as per se imposing a\n\nspecific intent requirement runs counter to the careful, context-\n\nspecific weighing of text, structure, legislative history, and\n\ngeneral considerations that we have long employed and is contrary\n\nto our analysis in Tobin.\n\n           The legislative history, in turn, supports a reading that\n\nintent in the sense of knowledge suffices.      Congress described the\n\nevils of the child pornography market by focusing on the child\n\nvictims involved, not by distinguishing between the motives of\n\npurveyors.     Trafficking   in   child   pornography    has   an   equally\n\nhorrific effect upon the children involved irrespective of whether\n\nthe trafficker actively desires or merely knows that his actions\n\nwill likely make images of child pornography more available to\n\nothers.   That Congress eliminated the requirement that traffickers\n\nin child pornography could only be prosecuted if they were acting\n\nwith a commercial purpose underscores Congress' understanding that\n\nsuch conduct is culpable regardless of the underlying motive.          See\n\nH.R. Rep. 98-536, at 16-17.\n\n           We also turn to the \"general considerations\" explained in\n\nTobin.    These considerations strongly confirm that § 2G2.4(c)(2)\n\ndoes not require specific, purposeful intent.           We should instead\n\nrest upon the default assumption discussed in Bailey and elsewhere\n\n\nUnited States v.

Another subsection of the statute at issue in Tobin\n\nprohibited making phone calls if those calls involved content that\n\ncould be considered child pornography, with the intent to harass\n\nanother person.      Tobin stated that this subsection \"involve[d]\n\nsuspicious or even malign conduct\" and concluded that unlike the\n\nprovision at issue, \"intent\" in this subsection meant only \"mere\n\nknowledge of consequences.\"      Tobin, 552 F.3d at 33.8\n\n          Further,    courts    are   ordinarily   concerned    with   the\n\ndistinction between specific and general intent when defining\n\nelements of a crime in order to put defendants on notice of where\n\nthe line between culpable and innocent conduct falls.

Our holding centers on the facts of this case.                      As\n\nthe   sentencing      judge     emphasized,      Dyer   chose    to     download      and\n\nfrequently use LimeWire, a type of peer-to-peer software that\n\ncreates a shared system of users, and he did so to acquire images\n\nof child pornography for his personal collection.9                     He downloaded\n\nthese files into a \"shared\" folder that he knew would be made\n\navailable   to   others.         He   did   so    for   two    years    and    gave    no\n\nindication to Agents Lechner and Pritchard that he would have\n\nstopped had he not been arrested.                 He knew how to turn off the\n\n\"sharing\"   feature        of   LimeWire    and    prevent      other     users    from\n\naccessing these features, but he did not, at any point, make an\n\neffort to do so.        By his actions, Dyer took deliberate steps to\n\nbecome    part   of    a    virtual    community        of    consumers       of   child\n\npornography who shared images to enlarge their own collections.\n\nOur holding that these acts showed an \"intent to traffic\" likewise\n\ncomports with the holdings of other circuits on similar fact\n\npatterns.

When a user downloads LimeWire, the\nprogram creates a new folder on his computer where any files\ndownloaded from LimeWire will be saved.

Dyer, by his own\n\nadmission, was differently situated from an unwitting LimeWire user\n\nwho failed to realize that by downloading files, he was also saving\n\nthem to a \"shared,\" universally accessible folder on his own\n\ncomputer.

Dyer's long-term, purposeful use of LimeWire, his\ndeliberate failure to turn off the file-sharing function, and his\nawareness that other users could download child pornography from\nhis \"shared\" folder could reasonably be found to amount to a\nspecific intent to share these images with other users, not just\nknowledge that such a result was the likely consequence of his\nactions.\n\n                                    -26-\n\fother LimeWire users by transferring the files to another location.\n\nThis, Dyer claims, violated his Confrontation Clause rights because\n\nthe grand jury testimony was never part of the record and because\n\nhe had no chance to challenge that testimony during the sentencing\n\nhearing.\n\n            This    argument   lacks    merit,   not    least   because    the\n\nConfrontation Clause does not apply at sentencing.

I dissent from the majority's conclusion that\n\nAppellant Mark David Dyer (\"Dyer\") was properly sentenced under\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2G2.4(c)(2) for possession of child pornography with\n\nintent to traffic.     I write separately to state my conclusion that\n\n§   2G2.4(c)(2)    requires   specific     intent    to   traffic   in     child\n\npornography and to note that the facts of this case fail to\n\nestablish that Dyer exhibited specific intent to traffic in child\n\npornography.      I join the majority in rejecting Dyer's claim that\n\nthe sentencing court violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront\n\nthe witnesses presented against him.\n\n        I.    U.S.S.G. § 2G2.4(c)(2) requires specific intent\n\n             The determination of the sentence that should be applied\n\nto Dyer's conviction for possession of child pornography hinges\n\nupon an interpretation of the term \"intent to traffic\" within the\n\npurview of § 2G2.4(c)(2). The majority interprets the term \"intent\n\nto traffic\" to require general intent in the sense of knowledge,\n\nand not specific or purposeful intent.              I respectfully disagree\n\nwith this interpretation.\n\n             During the sentencing proceedings Dyer argued that he had\n\nno intention to distribute the images he possessed and that he did\n\nnot have \"an actual intention for anybody else to receive those\n\nimages.\"     The government, on the other hand, contended that Dyer\n\npossessed the images with intent to traffic.               On the basis of\n\n\n                                    -29-\n\fDyer's arguments and taking into consideration the government's\n\nposition, the district court concluded that Dyer's actions met the\n\nrequirements of § 2G2.4(c)(2).1   On appeal, Dyer argues that the\n\ngovernment failed to show that he acted with specific intent to\n\ntraffic in child pornography and the government has not contested\n\nDyer's assertion that § 2G2.4(c)(2) requires specific intent.\n\n          As a threshold matter, the majority claims that Dyer has\n\nwaived the argument that § 2G2.4(c)(2) requires the government to\n\nprove that he acted with specific intent to traffic in child\n\npornography.   The majority's attempt to justify the application of\n\nplain error review in this case fails not the least because the\n\nrecord shows that Dyer has argued that he lacked actual or specific\n\nintent, but because it is clear that the government never argued\n\nthat § 2G2.4(c)(2) requires general intent to traffic.   Thus, the\n\ngovernment never put the district court in position to decide\n\nwhether general intent suffices to apply § 2G2.4(c)(2).         The\n\nmajority therefore errs when it faults Dyer for not developing his\n\n\n     1\n          The majority underscores the fact that the sentencing\ncourt never interpreted the term intent within the purview of\n§ 2G2.4 (c)(2).    The majority also concludes that the district\ncourt did not plainly err when it concluded that Dyer's actions met\nthe Guideline's intent requirements.       In so concluding, the\nmajority assumes that the district court inferred a general intent\nrequirement from § 2G2.4(c)(2).        However, in my view, the\ngovernment's failure to argue that general intent suffices in this\ncase, reveals that the district court interpreted § 2G2.4(c)(2) in\nlight of Dyer's argument that he lacked actual or specific intent\nto traffic.   The district court therefore did not hold, as the\nmajority does today, that general intent suffices to sentence Dyer\nunder § 2G2.4(c)(2).\n\n                               -30-\n\fspecific intent argument, even though Dyer has argued that he\n\nlacked specific intent and the government never claimed that\n\ngeneral intent suffices to apply § 2G2.4(c)(2).

The court thus rejected the proposed\ninstruction on the basis that the statute in controversy did not\nrequire knowledge or purpose to violate the law. But contrary to\nthe majority's assertion, the Gantos court did not hold that\nspecific intent is not ordinarily required in criminal offenses.\n\n                                       -34-\n\fgovernment establishes by preponderance of the evidence that the\n\ndefendant intended to traffic in said material.                          A requirement of\n\nspecific     intent       is    thus       consistent          with     the     Commission's\n\nendeavoring    to     separate         punishment      for       possession        of    child\n\npornography from those offenses that involve trafficking in said\n\nmaterial.     It also guarantees that only those who are more than\n\nmere possessors of child pornography are sentenced under § 2G2.2\n\nand its trafficking provisions.\n\n            Secondly, I disagree with the majority's assertion that\n\na   requirement      of    general         intent     better          comports    with     the\n\nlegislative history of the statutes that criminalize trafficking in\n\nchild   pornography.           In    the    majority's          view,     the    fact     that\n\ntrafficking in child pornography no longer requires proof that the\n\ndefendant acted with a commercial purpose reveals that motives are\n\nirrelevant     and     that         consequently      §        2G2.4(c)(2)       should     be\n\ninterpreted to require general intent to traffic. In pursuing this\n\nargument,    the     majority        conflates      the    actions       that     amount    to\n\ntrafficking in child pornography with the mens rea required by the\n\nGuidelines.    The fact that financial gain or commercial purpose is\n\nnot necessary to convict an individual for trafficking in child\n\npornography informs our interpretation of the term \"traffic\" by\n\nclarifying    the     actions        that    amount       to    trafficking        in    child\n\npornography.       However, this legislative history does not end our\n\ninquiry regarding the mens rea an individual must exhibit to be\n\n\n\n                                            -35-\n\fdeemed to possess child pornography with intent to traffic. We are\n\nhere   concerned        with   whether     the     defendant     possessed      child\n\npornography with intent to traffic, not with whether he was moved\n\nby an expectation to recoup a profit.              The fact that Congress made\n\ntrafficking in child pornography a crime regardless of whether the\n\ndefendant was moved by a commercial purpose is not inconsistent\n\nwith the interpretation that § 2G2.4(c)(2) requires the government\n\nto show that the defendant specifically intended to traffic in\n\nchild pornography.\n\n              Thirdly, in my view, the majority misapplies the general\n\nconsiderations of criminal law when it relies on this court's\n\ndecision in United States v.

I disagree.      In pursuing this argument, the\n\nmajority fails to ascertain that although general intent has been\n\nheld sufficient to meet the mens rea requirement for most crimes,\n\nthis general principle is ordinarily applied where the criminal\n\nstatute is silent as to the mens rea required.

But where, as here, the plain language of the\n\nstatutory text includes a mens rea requirement, we need not resort\n\nto the general considerations invoked by the majority.\n\n              Although general intent may generally be sufficient in\n\nmost crimes to support a conviction, Bailey, 444 U.S. at 408, we\n\nare dealing in this case with a narrow category of crimes that\n\nrequire a heightened level of mental culpability.                  Therefore, the\n\nprinciple that ordinarily general intent suffices for most crimes\n\ndoes not control our inquiry in this case.\n\n              Finally, the majority errs in its reliance on dicta from\n\nTobin    to   conclude     that   trafficking       in   child   pornography       is\n\ninherently bad conduct and therefore knowledge of the consequences\n\nof such action satisfies the Guidelines' mens rea requirement.                    In\n\nTobin, this court held that a statute which criminalized the making\n\nof repeated phone calls with intent to harass required specific\n\nintent to harass and further intimated that general intent could be\n\nrequired by a different section of said statute that criminalized\n\nobscene calls or calls that involved child pornography.                    552 F.3d\n\nat 33.    The Tobin court was only concerned with interpreting the\n\nstatute's section that criminalized the making of repeated phone\n\ncalls with intent to harass. Therefore, any expressions related to\n\n\n\n                                       -37-\n\fthe making of obscene calls or calls involving child pornography\n\nconstitute dicta that does not bind the court in the present case.\n\nIn addition, the court in Tobin reached its determination by\n\ninterpreting the statute as a whole and differentiating between the\n\nharms posed by the types of conduct prohibited under it.                            The\n\ncourt, however, did not rule that when a statute criminalizes\n\nactions related to child pornography it should be interpreted to\n\nrequire knowledge as opposed to purpose.                 Tobin is therefore scant\n\nauthority for the majority's interpretation that §2G2.4(c)(2) only\n\nrequires general intent.\n\n            In   interpreting      §   2G2.4(c)(2)         I   am    guided    by   the\n\nprinciple that the statute's plain language is the starting point\n\nof our interpretation.

Parmelee, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780846\"><a href=\"/opinion/780846/united-states-v-vernon-earl-parmelee-aka-vernon-earl-parmalee/\"><span class=\"volume\">319</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">583</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 594 (applying § 2G2.4(c)(2) to a defendant convicted for\n\npossession of child pornography where the evidence established that\n\ndefendant stored pornographic images on recordable compact discs\n\nwhich he intended to barter with other people for programs or\n\nservices).\n\n           The facts of this case show that Dyer used the file-\n\nsharing application LimeWire to download child pornography; he knew\n\nthat   when   files   were      downloaded    from   LimeWire   the    program\n\nautomatically    saved    the    files   in   a   shared   folder     that   was\n\npotentially available to other users; and he failed to remove the\n\nfiles to make them unavailable for sharing.           It is thus clear that\n\nDyer knowingly downloaded child pornography through LimeWire and\n\nthat he understood that LimeWire automatically saves images in a\n\nshared folder.    But these actions do not show he purposely sought\n\nto trade, exchange, or barter in child pornography or that he\n\nspecifically intended to engage in the sort of activities that have\n\nbeen held to amount to trafficking in child pornography.\n\n           The critical factor to discern whether Dyer intended to\n\ntraffic child pornography via LimeWire is not whether he had\n\n\n\n                                     -40-\n\fknowledge of how LimeWire works in terms of file-sharing, but\n\nrather whether by using LimeWire to download child pornography Dyer\n\nintended to traffic in said items.     We lack proof that Dyer used\n\nLimeWire with the objective of offering the images for barter or\n\nexchange with others.   We similarly lack evidence that Dyer sought\n\nto engage in an active exchange of images of child pornography with\n\nthe purpose to receive further images in return.     Moreover, the\n\nevidence actually established that Dyer had not traded any images\n\nover the Internet via e-mail, chat-rooms, bulletin boards, or\n\nnewsgroups.\n\n          Absent proof that Dyer allowed LimeWire to keep images in\n\na shared folder with the purpose of engaging in an exchange of\n\nimages, I cannot partake in the majority's conclusion that the\n\nsentencing court properly applied § 2G2.4(c)(2).    Specific intent\n\nin this case is inextricably bound to affirmative actions to\n\ntraffic in child pornography.    In my view, use of LimeWire with\n\nknowledge of its automatic file-sharing features and Dyer's failure\n\nto disable the sharing feature is insufficient to conclude that\n\nDyer exhibited specific intent to traffic absent evidence that he\n\ntook additional actions to offer the images for exchange with the\n\nexpectation that he would receive further commodities in return.\n\n          I also note my concern with the majority's efforts to\n\nequate intent to share with intent to traffic.        Although the\n\nmajority claims it is not holding that mere use of LimeWire amounts\n\n\n\n                                -41-\n\fto trafficking in child pornography, its interpretation that the\n\n\"crucial acts separating possession from trafficking involve intent\n\nto share images of child pornography with others,\" threatens to do\n\njust that.        While use of a file-sharing program may provide\n\ncircumstantial evidence of intent to traffic, a finding that there\n\nis specific intent to traffic requires more than knowing use of a\n\nfile-sharing      program.     It   requires      proof   that   the   defendant\n\nintended to engage in an exchange of commodities or goods with the\n\nexpectation to receive some type of commodity in return.                        The\n\ninference that sharing is tantamount to trafficking lowers the\n\nthreshold    of   the   actions     that   have    been   held   to    amount    to\n\ntrafficking and leads to the imposition of criminal liability for\n\ntrafficking where the user has not exchanged commodities by barter.\n\n            For   these    reasons,   I    respectfully     dissent     from    the\n\ndetermination that Dyer was correctly sentenced under § 2G2.4\n\n(c)(2).\n\n                          III. Confrontation Clause\n\n            Finally, I join the majority in rejecting Dyer's claim\n\nthat the sentencing court relied on Agent Lechner's grand jury\n\ntestimony, thereby depriving Dyer of his right to cross-examine\n\nAgent Lechner regarding his grand jury testimony.                     We have to\n\nevaluate this claim under the plain error standard of review\n\nbecause Dyer failed to raise the Confrontation Clause issue before\n\nthe district court. United States v. González-Castillo, 562 F.3d\n\n\n                                      -42-\n\f80, 82 (1st Cir. 2009).           As the majority states, there is no\n\nevidence   in   the   record     that    the   sentencing   court   relied   on\n\nLechner's grand jury testimony without allowing Dyer to elucidate\n\nthis testimony at sentencing.           Absent an obvious or clear error by\n\nthe sentencing court, Dyer's claim that the sentencing court\n\ndeprived him of his right to confront Agent Lechner regarding his\n\ngrand jury testimony must therefore fail.\n\n                               IV. Conclusions\n\n           I    dissent   from    the    majority's   conclusion    that     the\n\ndistrict court properly sentenced Dyer pursuant to § 2G2.4(c)(2).\n\nI would hold that § 2G2.4(c)(2) requires specific intent to traffic\n\nand that the facts of this case fail to show that Dyer exhibited\n\nspecific intent to traffic in child pornography.             I concur in the\n\ndetermination that the district court did not violate Dyer's Sixth\n\nAmendment right to confront the witnesses presented against him.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -43-\n\f</pre>",
