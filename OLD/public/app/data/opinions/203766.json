In this sentencing appeal,\n\nappellant, Ynocencio González-Castillo (\"González\") -- a Dominican\n\nnational who pled guilty to unlawfully entering the United States\n\nafter being previously deported –- challenges the sentence imposed\n\non him by the district court.         The only issue presented is whether\n\nthe sentencing court committed plain error when it imposed a\n\nsentence based, in part, on a fact not supported by the record.\n\nAfter careful consideration, we conclude that the facts presented\n\nby this appeal require that appellant's sentence be vacated and\n\nthat the case be remanded for resentencing.\n\n                                I.   Background\n\n           On November 13, 2006, appellant was detained by the\n\nBorder Patrol near Isabela, Puerto Rico, for a possible immigration\n\nlaw violation.    Appellant was suspected of being an undocumented\n\nDominican national who had illegally disembarked a few hours\n\nearlier from a migrant vessel.          Thereafter, an investigation was\n\nconducted, during which a comparison of appellant's fingerprints\n\nidentified him as being a previously convicted felon who had been\n\nremoved   from   the   United    States     on   February   2,   2005   for   the\n\ncommission of an aggravated felony.              Appellant was consequently\n\nordered detained without bail.\n\n           On February 23, 2007, the appellant pled guilty to\n\nunlawful entry into the United States after being previously\n\ndeported for commission of an aggravated felony in violation of 8\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fU.S.C. § 1326(a)(2), (b)(2).           His guideline sentencing range\n\n(\"GSR\") was determined to be 57 to 71 months.          At the sentencing\n\nhearing the court stated that \"[t]his is [appellant's] second entry\n\ninto   the    United   States   without    obtaining   prior   consent   or\n\nauthorization from the U.S. Attorney General\" (emphasis added) and\n\nalso made reference to his record of two prior drug convictions as\n\nwell as one for a weapons violation.             Thereafter, the court\n\nreemphasized    the    appellant's   multiple   illegal   entries   as   an\n\nimportant factor in determining his sentence, stating that, \"[i]n\n\nlight of Defendant's prior convictions [and] his two illegal\n\nentries in a two-year period, into the United States, deterrence is\n\nthe salient factor in this particular case.\" (emphasis added).1          No\n\n\n\n1\n  The sentencing court made these statements in the context of the\nfollowing recitation at the sentencing hearing:\n\n             Before the Court is a 40-year-old Dominican\n             national whose immigration status is that of\n             an illegal alien.    This is his second entry\n             into the United States without obtaining prior\n             consent or authorization from the U.S.\n             Attorney General. He was previously deported\n             in the year 2004 as an aggravated felon upon a\n             drug felony conviction in the district of New\n             York.   He has a record of two prior drug\n             convictions and a weapons conviction.\n             In light of Defendant's prior convictions, his\n             two illegal entries in a two-year period, into\n             the United States, deterrence is the salient\n             factor in this particular case.     Therefore,\n             the Court finds that a sentence within the\n             applicable   advisory    guideline  range   is\n             sufficient but not greater than necessary to\n             meet statutory objectives of punishment and\n             deterrence in this case.\n\n                                     -3-\n\fobjection was made by appellant's counsel to the court's statements\n\nregarding defendant's \"two illegal entries.\" Additionally, neither\n\nthe government attorney nor the probation officer present at the\n\nsentencing hearing indicated any disagreement with the accuracy of\n\nthis factual conclusion.      Appellant was ultimately sentenced to 71\n\nmonths' imprisonment, the high end of the applicable GSR.\n\n           As it turns out, and as the government concedes, there is\n\nnothing in the record to support the district court's assertion\n\nthat this was appellant's second illegal entry into the United\n\nStates, given that nothing in the record suggests that appellant's\n\nfirst   entry   into   the   United   States   was   illegal   or   that   any\n\nsubsequent illegal entries took place.          The record and the Pre-\n\nSentence Report (\"PSR\") indicate that, after González's first entry\n\ninto the United States in 1996, \"[h]e adjusted his residency in\n\n1997, when he married.\" This fact establishes that, at least after\n\n1997 and prior to his deportation in 2004, appellant was legally in\n\nthe United States.      That appellant held legal status during this\n\nperiod is confirmed by the fact that when appellant was deported on\n\nFebruary 2, 2004, he was not deported as an illegal alien, but as\n\na permanent resident alien who had committed an aggravated felony.\n\nMoreover, the fact that appellant was able to adjust his status\n\nlegally through marriage renders it less likely that his initial\n\nentry in 1996 was illegal, as lawful entry is, in the vast majority\n\nof cases, a prerequisite for adjustment.             See, e.g., 8 U.S.C.\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f§ 1255(a) (stating that the \"status of an alien who was inspected\n\nand admitted or paroled into the United States . . . may be\n\nadjusted . . . to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent\n\nresidence\" (emphasis added)).        At the very least, a contrary\n\ninference cannot be presumed.      Finally, even if appellant's first\n\nentry into the United States in 1996 were illegal, a fact for which\n\nthere is absolutely no support in the record, this still would not\n\nsupport the court's assertion at the 2007 sentencing hearing, that\n\nappellant had committed two illegal entries in a two-year period.\n\nThe district court's error in basing appellant's sentence on these\n\nunsupportable factual assertions forms the basis of the instant\n\nappeal.\n\n                            II.   Discussion\n\n            Because appellant's lawyer failed to object at sentencing\n\nto   the   district   court's   unsupported    statement   regarding   his\n\nmultiple illegal entries, \"we review for plain error.\"            United\n\nStates v. Mangual-García, 505 F.3d 1, 15 (1st Cir. 2007).2        For us\n\nto vacate a sentence under the plain error standard, appellant\n\nbears the burden of establishing that \"(1) an error occurred; (2)\n\nthe error was clear and obvious; (3) the error affected the\n\ndefendant's substantial rights; and (4) the error impaired the\n\n\n\n2\n  Notwithstanding the failure of González's attorney to raise the\nerror, we note that the government also contributed to the error by\nfailing to call the matter to the attention of the sentencing\ncourt.\n\n                                   -5-\n\ffairness,     integrity,   or   public   reputation   of   the   judicial\n\nproceedings.\"    Id.\n\n            We keep in mind that in reviewing the reasonableness of\n\na sentence, we must first determine whether the district court\n\ncommitted any procedural errors.         United States v. Politano, 522\n\nF.3d 69, 72 (1st Cir. 2008).        Such errors include \"selecting a\n\nsentence based on clearly erroneous facts.\" Gall v. United States,\n\n128 S. Ct. 586, 597 (2007).\n\n            Applying the plain error standard, we find that there is\n\nno question that an error occurred, a point that the government now\n\nconcedes.     Nor does the government dispute that the error was\n\n\"clear and obvious,\" as it certainly was, given that, as explained\n\nabove, the subject of the present conviction is the only instance\n\nof an illegal entry by the appellant at any time shown anywhere in\n\nthe record.    See Mangual-García, 505 F.3d at 15.    Notably, this was\n\na procedural error, which, under a different procedural posture,\n\nwould constitute an \"abuse of discretion.\"        See United States v.\n\nTorres, 541 F.3d 48, 51 (1st Cir. 2008) (listing \"selecting a\n\nsentence based on clearly erroneous facts\" as among the \"procedural\n\nerrors amounting to an abuse of discretion\" by the sentencing\n\ncourt).\n\n            Nevertheless, because our review is for plain error, we\n\nmust proceed to the third and fourth prongs of the plain error\n\nanalysis and inquire whether the sentencing court's error affected\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fappellant's substantial rights, and whether basing the sentence on\n\nthis erroneous fact of apparent significance to the sentencing\n\ncourt impaired the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the\n\njudicial proceeding.     We believe that the answer to both inquiries\n\nfavors the appellant.\n\n           First, in terms of substantial rights, this prong of the\n\nplain error inquiry translates, in the sentencing context, into the\n\nrequirement of \"a reasonable probability that, but for the error,\n\nthe district court would have imposed a different, more favorable\n\nsentence.\"   United States v. Perazza-Mercado, 553 F.3d 65, 78 (1st\n\nCir. 2009) (quoting United States v. Gilman, 478 F.3d 440, 447 (1st\n\nCir. 2007)).   The government is in a tenuous position in arguing\n\nthat appellant's rights were not substantially affected by the\n\nsentencing court's assumption of the unsupported fact.          The nature\n\nof the error was such that the court erroneously believed that the\n\nappellant had already committed, within a two-year period, the very\n\nsame crime for which he was then being sentenced, namely, illegal\n\nentry. This unsupported \"fact,\" \"two illegal entries in a two-year\n\nperiod,\" became, along with the appellant's \"prior convictions,\" a\n\nprimary   reason   why   the   court   chose,   in   its   words,   to   make\n\ndeterrence \"the salient factor\" in this case. It then proceeded to\n\nimpose the highest sentence possible within the applicable GSR.\n\nThere is, no doubt, a reasonable probability that had the taint of\n\n\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fthis factual error been absent, the weight behind a deterrence-\n\ndriven sentence would have been substantially reduced.\n\n           Moreover, in assessing the importance attributed by the\n\ncourt to this unfounded \"fact,\" we find it particularly telling\n\nthat the court mentioned the \"fact\" twice in explaining the top-of-\n\nthe-GSR, deterrence-driven sentence ultimately imposed.           There is\n\ncertainly a \"reasonable probability\" that, but for the error,\n\nGonzález would have received a lesser sentence.            See id. at 78.\n\nThus, in view of the sentencing court's explanatory statements, it\n\nwould be contrary to logic to conclude that the court's factual\n\nerror did not affect appellant's substantial rights.\n\n           Lastly, we believe that basing a substantial criminal\n\nsentence on a non-existent material fact threatens to compromise\n\nthe fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings.\n\nIt is well-established that a criminal defendant holds \"a due\n\nprocess right to be sentenced upon information which is not false\n\nor materially incorrect.\"        United States v. Pellerito, 918 F.2d\n\n999, 1002 (1st Cir. 1990); see also Townsend v. Burke, 334 U.S.\n\n736, 740-41 (1948).     We think that the fairness of appellant's\n\nsentence   was   impaired   by   the   deprivation   of   this   right   and\n\ntherefore, even under plain error review, we should exercise our\n\ndiscretion to afford him a new sentencing hearing.\n\n           The sentence imposed on appellant is vacated and the case\n\nis remanded for action consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fVacated and Remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                        -9-\n\f",

The only issue presented is whether the sentencing court committed plain error when it imposed a sentence based, in part, on a fact not supported by the record. After careful consideration, we conclude that the facts presented by this appeal require that appellant's sentence be vacated and that the case be remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>On November 13, 2006, appellant was detained by the Border Patrol near Isabela, Puerto Rico, for a possible immigration law violation. Appellant was suspected of being an undocumented Dominican national who had illegally disembarked a few hours earlier from a migrant vessel. Thereafter, an investigation was conducted, during which a comparison of appellant's fingerprints identified him as being a previously convicted felon who had been removed from the United States on February 2, 2005 for the commission of an aggravated felony. Appellant was consequently ordered detained without bail.</p>\n<p>On February 23, 2007, the appellant pled guilty to unlawful entry into the United States after being previously deported for commission of an aggravated felony in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1326(a)(2), (b)(2). His guideline sentencing range (\"GSR\") was determined to be 57 to 71 months. At the sentencing hearing the court stated that \"[t]his is [appellant's] <i>second entry</i> into the United States without obtaining prior consent or authorization from the U.S. Attorney General\" (emphasis added) and also made reference to his record of two prior drug convictions as well as one for a weapons violation. Thereafter, the court reemphasized the appellant's multiple illegal entries as an important factor in determining his sentence, stating that, \"[i]n light of Defendant's prior convictions [and] his <i>two illegal entries</i> in a two-year period, into the United States, deterrence is the salient factor in this particular case.\" (emphasis added).<sup>[1]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*82</span> No objection was made by appellant's counsel to the court's statements regarding defendant's \"two illegal entries.\" Additionally, neither the government attorney nor the probation officer present at the sentencing hearing indicated any disagreement with the accuracy of this factual conclusion.

The record and the Pre-Sentence Report (\"PSR\") indicate that, after González's first entry into the United States in 1996, \"[h]e adjusted his residency in 1997, when he married.\" This fact establishes that, at least after 1997 and prior to his deportation in 2004, appellant was legally in the United States. That appellant held legal status during this period is confirmed by the fact that when appellant was deported on February 2, 2004, he was not deported as an illegal alien, but as a permanent resident alien who had committed an aggravated felony. Moreover, the fact that appellant was able to adjust his status legally through marriage renders it less likely that his initial entry in 1996 was illegal, as lawful entry is, in the vast majority of cases, a prerequisite for adjustment. <i>See, e.g.,</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a) (stating that the \"status of an alien who was <i>inspected and admitted or paroled</i> into the United States ... may be adjusted ... to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence\" (emphasis added)). At the very least, a contrary inference cannot be presumed. Finally, even if appellant's first entry into the United States in 1996 <i>were</i> illegal, a fact for which there is absolutely no support in the record, this still would not support the court's assertion at the 2007 sentencing hearing, that appellant had committed two illegal entries <i>in a two-year period.</i> The district court's error in basing appellant's sentence on these unsupportable factual assertions forms the basis of the instant appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Because appellant's lawyer failed to object at sentencing to the district court's unsupported statement regarding his multiple illegal entries, \"we review for plain error.\" <i>United States v.

Meconiates, Assistant United States Attorney, Rosa Emilia Rodríguez-Vélez, United States Attorney, and Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, Chief, Appellate Division, on brief for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before TORRUELLA, SELYA, and LEVAL,<sup>[*]</sup> Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>In this sentencing appeal, appellant, Ynocencio González-Castillo (\"González\")a Dominican national who pled guilty to unlawfully entering the United States after being previously deported challenges the sentence imposed on him by the district court. The only issue presented is whether the sentencing court committed plain error when it imposed a sentence based, in part, on a fact not supported by the record. After careful consideration, we conclude that the facts presented by this appeal require that appellant's sentence be vacated and that the case be remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>On November 13, 2006, appellant was detained by the Border Patrol near Isabela, Puerto Rico, for a possible immigration law violation. Appellant was suspected of being an undocumented Dominican national who had illegally disembarked a few hours earlier from a migrant vessel. Thereafter, an investigation was conducted, during which a comparison of appellant's fingerprints identified him as being a previously convicted felon who had been removed from the United States on February 2, 2005 for the commission of an aggravated felony. Appellant was consequently ordered detained without bail.</p>\n<p>On February 23, 2007, the appellant pled guilty to unlawful entry into the United States after being previously deported for commission of an aggravated felony in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1326(a)(2), (b)(2). His guideline sentencing range (\"GSR\") was determined to be 57 to 71 months. At the sentencing hearing the court stated that \"[t]his is [appellant's] <i>second entry</i> into the United States without obtaining prior consent or authorization from the U.S. Attorney General\" (emphasis added) and also made reference to his record of two prior drug convictions as well as one for a weapons violation. Thereafter, the court reemphasized the appellant's multiple illegal entries as an important factor in determining his sentence, stating that, \"[i]n light of Defendant's prior convictions [and] his <i>two illegal entries</i> in a two-year period, into the United States, deterrence is the salient factor in this particular case.\" (emphasis added).<sup>[1]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*82</span> No objection was made by appellant's counsel to the court's statements regarding defendant's \"two illegal entries.\" Additionally, neither the government attorney nor the probation officer present at the sentencing hearing indicated any disagreement with the accuracy of this factual conclusion. Appellant was ultimately sentenced to 71 months' imprisonment, the high end of the applicable GSR.</p>\n<p>As it turns out, and as the government concedes, there is nothing in the record to support the district court's assertion that this was appellant's <i>second</i> illegal entry into the United States, given that nothing in the record suggests that appellant's first entry into the United States was illegal or that any subsequent illegal entries took place. The record and the Pre-Sentence Report (\"PSR\") indicate that, after González's first entry into the United States in 1996, \"[h]e adjusted his residency in 1997, when he married.\" This fact establishes that, at least after 1997 and prior to his deportation in 2004, appellant was legally in the United States. That appellant held legal status during this period is confirmed by the fact that when appellant was deported on February 2, 2004, he was not deported as an illegal alien, but as a permanent resident alien who had committed an aggravated felony. Moreover, the fact that appellant was able to adjust his status legally through marriage renders it less likely that his initial entry in 1996 was illegal, as lawful entry is, in the vast majority of cases, a prerequisite for adjustment. <i>See, e.g.,</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a) (stating that the \"status of an alien who was <i>inspected and admitted or paroled</i> into the United States ... may be adjusted ... to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence\" (emphasis added)). At the very least, a contrary inference cannot be presumed. Finally, even if appellant's first entry into the United States in 1996 <i>were</i> illegal, a fact for which there is absolutely no support in the record, this still would not support the court's assertion at the 2007 sentencing hearing, that appellant had committed two illegal entries <i>in a two-year period.</i> The district court's error in basing appellant's sentence on these unsupportable factual assertions forms the basis of the instant appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Because appellant's lawyer failed to object at sentencing to the district court's unsupported statement regarding his multiple illegal entries, \"we review for plain error.\" <i>United States v. Mangual-García,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202945\"><a href=\"/opinion/202945/united-states-v-mangual-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 15 (1st Cir.2007).<sup>[2]</sup> For us to vacate a sentence under the plain error standard, appellant bears the burden of establishing that \"(1) an error occurred; (2) the error was clear and obvious; (3) the error affected the defendant's substantial rights; and (4) the error impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>We keep in mind that in reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence, we must first <span class=\"star-pagination\">*83</span> determine whether the district court committed any procedural errors. <i>United States v. Politano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203223\"><a href=\"/opinion/203223/united-states-v-politano/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></a></span>, 72 (1st Cir.2008). Such errors include \"selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts.\" <i>Gall v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145843\"><a href=\"/opinion/145843/gall-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span>, 597, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145843\"><a href=\"/opinion/145843/gall-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">169</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span> (2007).</p>\n<p>Applying the plain error standard, we find that there is no question that an error occurred, a point that the government now concedes. Nor does the government dispute that the error was \"clear and obvious,\" as it certainly was, given that, as explained above, the subject of the present conviction is the <i>only</i> instance of an illegal entry by the appellant at any time shown anywhere in the record. <i>See </i><i>Mangual-García,</i> 505 F.3d at 15. Notably, this was a <i>procedural</i> error, which, under a different procedural posture, would constitute an \"abuse of discretion.\" <i>See </i><i>United States v. Torres,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203477\"><a href=\"/opinion/203477/united-states-v-torres/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></a></span>, 51 (1st Cir. 2008) (listing \"selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts\" as among the \"procedural errors amounting to an abuse of discretion\" by the sentencing court).</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, because our review is for plain error, we must proceed to the third and fourth prongs of the plain error analysis and inquire whether the sentencing court's error affected appellant's substantial rights, and whether basing the sentence on this erroneous fact of apparent significance to the sentencing court impaired the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceeding. We believe that the answer to both inquiries favors the appellant.</p>\n<p>First, in terms of substantial rights, this prong of the plain error inquiry translates, in the sentencing context, into the requirement of \"a reasonable probability that, but for the error, the district court would have imposed a different, more favorable sentence.\" <i>United States v. Perazza-Mercado,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203689\"><a href=\"/opinion/203689/united-states-v-perazza-mercado/\"><span class=\"volume\">553</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span></a></span>, 78 (1st Cir.2009) (quoting <i>United States v. Gilman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202657\"><a href=\"/opinion/202657/united-states-v-gilman/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">440</span></a></span>, 447 (1st Cir.2007)). The government is in a tenuous position in arguing that appellant's rights were not substantially affected by the sentencing court's assumption of the unsupported fact. The nature of the error was such that the court erroneously believed that the appellant had already committed, within a two-year period, the very same crime for which he was then being sentenced, namely, illegal entry. This unsupported \"fact,\" \"two illegal entries in a two-year period,\" became, along with the appellant's \"prior convictions,\" a primary reason why the court chose, in its words, to make deterrence \"the salient factor\" in this case. It then proceeded to impose the highest sentence possible within the applicable GSR. There is, no doubt, a reasonable probability that had the taint of this factual error been absent, the weight behind a deterrence-driven sentence would have been substantially reduced.</p>\n<p>Moreover, in assessing the importance attributed by the court to this unfounded \"fact,\" we find it particularly telling that the court mentioned the \"fact\" twice in explaining the top-of-the-GSR, deterrence-driven sentence ultimately imposed. There is certainly a \"reasonable probability\" that, but for the error, González would have received a lesser sentence. <i>See id.</i> at 78. Thus, in view of the sentencing court's explanatory statements, it would be contrary to logic to conclude that the court's factual error did not affect appellant's substantial rights.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we believe that basing a substantial criminal sentence on a non-existent material fact threatens to compromise the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings. It is well-established that a criminal defendant holds \"a due process right to be sentenced upon information which is not false or materially incorrect.\" <i>United States v. Pellerito,</i> 918 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*84</span> F.2d 999, 1002 (1st Cir.1990); <i>see also </i><i>Townsend v. Burke,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104579\"><a href=\"/opinion/104579/townsend-v-burke/\"><span class=\"volume\">334</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">736</span></a></span>, 740-41, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104579\"><a href=\"/opinion/104579/townsend-v-burke/\"><span class=\"volume\">68</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1252</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104579\"><a href=\"/opinion/104579/townsend-v-burke/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1690</span></a></span> (1948). We think that the fairness of appellant's sentence was impaired by the deprivation of this right and therefore, even under plain error review, we should exercise our discretion to afford him a new sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p>The sentence imposed on appellant is vacated and the case is remanded for action consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>Vacated and Remanded.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Second Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The sentencing court made these statements in the context of the following recitation at the sentencing hearing:\n</p>\n<p>Before the Court is a 40-year-old Dominican national whose immigration status is that of an illegal alien. This is his <i>second entry into the United States without obtaining</i> <i>prior consent or authorization from the U.S. Attorney General.</i> He was previously deported in the year 2004 as an aggravated felon upon a drug felony conviction in the district of New York. He has a record of two prior drug convictions and a weapons conviction.</p>\n<p>In light of Defendant's prior convictions, <i>his two illegal entries in a two-year period,</i> into the United States, deterrence is the salient factor in this particular case. Therefore, the Court finds that a sentence within the applicable advisory guideline range is sufficient but not greater than necessary to meet statutory objectives of punishment and deterrence in this case.</p>\n<p>[2]  Notwithstanding the failure of González's attorney to raise the error, we note that the government also contributed to the error by failing to call the matter to the attention of the sentencing court.</p>\n\n</div>",
