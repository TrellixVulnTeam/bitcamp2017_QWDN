This is the third appeal filed in this case by Roger\n\nEdwards.1        This decision also resolves a motion by appellee Fiddes\n\n& Son, Ltd. (\"Fiddes\") requesting appellate sanctions under Fed. R.\n\nApp. P. 38, on the ground that Roger Edwards' second appeal--No.\n\n05-1306, appealing the denial of Rule 60(b) relief--was frivolous.\n\n                 Our prior two opinions, cited in the margin, chronicle\n\nthe long history of this commercial litigation.                 See Roger Edwards\n\nI, 387 F.3d at 92-94; Roger Edwards II, 427 F.3d at 131-32.                  After\n\nunfavorable partial summary judgments followed by an adverse jury\n\nverdict in July 2003, Roger Edwards filed its first appeal from the\n\noriginal \"merits\" judgment, which denied its claims against Fiddes\n\nand awarded Fiddes damages on a counterclaim.                   While that appeal\n\nwas pending, Roger Edwards in July 2004 filed a Rule 60(b) motion,\n\nFed.       R.   Civ.   P.    60(b),   for    relief    from   judgment,   alleging\n\nfraudulent conduct by Fiddes, including \"fraud on the court.\"\n\n\n\n       1\n      See Roger Edwards, LLC v. Fiddes & Sons, Ltd., 387 F.3d 90\n(1st Cir. 2004) (\"Roger Edwards I\") (appealing jury instructions\nand grant of partial summary judgment); Roger Edwards, LLC v.\nFiddes & Son Ltd., 427 F.3d 129 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"Roger Edwards\nII\") (appealing denial of Rule 60(b) motion for relief from\njudgment).\n\n                                            -2-\n\f               Fiddes not only opposed the motion but filed a motion for\n\nRule    11    sanctions      against   Roger    Edwards   for    having      filed   a\n\nfrivolous      Rule   60(b)     motion.       Thereafter,   we   resolved      Roger\n\nEdwards' first appeal by affirming the merits judgment.                        Roger\n\nEdwards I, 387 F.3d at 97.          The magistrate judge then took up Roger\n\nEdwards' pending Rule 60(b) motion, and denied it on January 26,\n\n2005.        He initially urged the parties to settle the sanctions\n\nissue, but this effort was unsuccessful.\n\n               Thereafter, on February 16, 2005, the magistrate judge\n\nissued an opinion and order granting Fiddes' motion for Rule 11\n\nsanctions.       Following a substantial discussion, the magistrate\n\njudge ruled that \"the filing of the [Rule 60(b)] motion was, under\n\nthe circumstances, frivolous, unreasonable and without foundation,\n\neven though it may not have been made in subjective bad faith.\"\n\nRoger    Edwards      and    its   attorney     were   ordered   to    pay    Fiddes\n\n\"reasonable attorney fees and other expenses incurred\" in opposing\n\nthe Rule 60(b) motion.\n\n               The next day, Roger Edwards filed an appeal to this court\n\nfrom the denial of its Rule 60(b) motion.              Roger Edwards also filed\n\na Rule 59(e) motion for reconsideration of the sanctions award,\n\nwhich was thereafter denied by the magistrate judge, who said that\n\nthe     motion    for       reconsideration     \"either     rehashes      arguments\n\npreviously advanced and which I have carefully considered or\n\nadvances new arguments not made either at the summary judgment\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fstage or in support of its Rule 60(b) motion and which are\n\ntherefore procedurally defaulted.\"\n\n            Roger Edwards then initiated a third appeal--the one now\n\nbefore us, No. 05-1679--to challenge the Rule 11 sanctions.\n\nFiddes in turn filed a motion for appellate sanctions under Fed. R.\n\nApp. P. 38 in connection with Roger Edwards' earlier appeal of the\n\ndenial of Rule 60(b) relief, No. 05-1306.              On October 31, 2005, we\n\naffirmed the magistrate judge's denial of Rule 60(b) relief, see\n\nRoger Edwards II, 427 F.3d at 137, but deferred a decision on the\n\nmotion for Rule 38 sanctions, id. at 132 n.1, so we could consider\n\nit together with the appeal of the Rule 11 sanctions.\n\n            Rule   11   \"prohibits    filings     made    with    'any    improper\n\npurpose,' the offering of 'frivolous' arguments, and the assertion\n\nof   factual   allegations      without     'evidentiary       support'    or     the\n\n'likely' prospect of such support.\" Young v. City of Providence ex\n\nrel.   Napolitano,      404   F.3d   33,   39   (1st    Cir.    2005).      Anyone\n\npresenting a motion must \"certify[] that to the best of the\n\nperson's    knowledge,    information,      and   belief,      formed     after   an\n\ninquiry reasonable under the circumstances,\" the paper being filed\n\ndoes not violate one of Rule 11's prohibitions.                  Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n11(b).     With respect to a legal contention, an argument is not\n\nfrivolous if\n\n            the   claims,   defenses,  and  other    legal\n            contentions therein are warranted by existing\n            law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the\n            extension,   modification,  or   reversal   of\n\n                                      -4-\n\f             existing law or the establishment of new law.\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(2).\n\n             To support a finding of frivolousness, some degree of\n\nfault   is   required,   but     the   fault   need    not    be    a    wicked   or\n\nsubjectively reckless state of mind; rather, an individual \"must,\n\nat the very least, be culpably careless to commit a violation.\"\n\nYoung, 404 F.3d at 39.         We review Rule 11 sanctions for abuse of\n\ndiscretion, but \"both a mistake of law and a clearly erroneous\n\nfinding of fact constitute such an abuse.\"                   Id. at 38 (citing\n\nCooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U.S. 384, 402 (1990)).\n\n             In the original merits case, Roger Edwards had charged\n\nFiddes with breaching an alleged exclusive dealing agreement for\n\nthe distribution of Fiddes' products; Fiddes had counterclaimed for\n\nunpaid invoices on delivered goods.            The magistrate judge found\n\n(based on documents coupled with Roger Edwards' own admissions)\n\nthat Roger Edwards had terminated the open-ended contract on\n\nNovember 19, 2001; he also granted Fiddes summary judgment on its\n\ncounterclaim.\n\n             These   summary    dispositions    left    open       for   trial    the\n\npossibility that Fiddes was liable to Roger Edwards for the period\n\nprior to termination.          The jury resolved liability for the pre-\n\nNovember 19 period by finding no breach by Fiddes before that date.\n\nThe magistrate judge entered judgment for Fiddes on the jury\n\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fverdict and awarded $17,286 to Fiddes on the counterclaim.                On\n\nappeal, we found no error.       Roger Edwards I, 387 F.3d at 97.\n\n           Roger Edwards' Rule 60(b) motion was based on a double\n\nproposition: that Fiddes' products had been mislabeled in numerous\n\nrespects--this is a shorthand version of the charge, which also\n\nincluded   alleged   improper    documentation--and    that,    during   the\n\noriginal   merits    case,      Fiddes    and   its   counsel    had     made\n\nmisrepresentations in discovery and court filings by asserting that\n\nits products were in compliance with U.S. law.           As proof of the\n\nformer, Roger Edwards offered an expert affidavit; for the latter,\n\nit pointed to three statements in the proceedings.\n\n           We agree with the magistrate judge that the Rule 60(b)\n\nmotion was hopeless.     The background law as to what constitutes\n\nfraud under Rule 60(b), and as to pertinent incidents like time\n\nlimits and prejudice, is admittedly no model of perfection; our own\n\nopinion on the appeal of the Rule 60(b) motion makes this clear\n\nwhile trying to sort out some of the problems.         See Roger Edwards\n\nII, 427 F.3d at 132-34.      If (against the background of somewhat\n\nfuzzy law) the Rule 60(b) motion might conceivably have succeeded,\n\nwe would not uphold the sanction.\n\n           The difficulty for Roger Edwards is that the deficiencies\n\nin its motion went well beyond debatable inference and colorable\n\nlegal argument. The affidavit offered to prove the mislabeling\n\npurported to identify numerous details in which the product had not\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fconformed to a parade of regulations; but the only basis for the\n\ncharge of fraud on the part of Fiddes in marketing the allegedly\n\nmislabeled product was the explicit, conclusory inference by the\n\nexpert that alleged mistakes must have been dishonest because there\n\nwere a lot of technical problems with the labeling.\n\n          The   further    charges    of   fraud,   based   on   the   three\n\nlitigation-related   statements       cited   by    Roger   Edwards,    were\n\npitifully weak; even weaker were any inferences of reliance or\n\nother showings that the alleged fraud \"'substantially interfered\n\nwith [the litigant's] ability fully and fairly to prepare for, and\n\nproceed at, trial.'\"      Tiller v. Baghdady, 294 F.3d 277, 280 (1st\n\nCir. 2002) (quoting Anderson v. Cryovac, Inc., 862 F.2d 910, 926\n\n(1st Cir.1988)).     Two of the statements are bland, unspecific\n\ndenials, at most debatably \"inaccurate,\" as to which reliance by an\n\nexperienced adversary is not credible; the third and more detailed\n\nstatement is not even arguably false.         See Roger Edwards II, 427\n\nF.3d at 135-37.\n\n          More important to the issue of sanctions for the filing\n\nof the Rule 60(b) motion, the outcome of the motion would be no\n\ndifferent even if there had been some basis for arguing that the\n\nproduct had been mislabeled and that Fiddes had misrepresented to\n\nthe contrary in the course of the litigation.           Roger Edwards was\n\nunable throughout the Rule 60(b) proceeding and the ensuing appeal\n\nto explain plausibly how such mislabeling would have altered the\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fjudgment   being   assailed   on   either   the    initial   claim   or   the\n\ncounterclaim.\n\n           On Roger Edwards' affirmative contract claim (for breach\n\nof exclusive dealing rights), the magistrate judge's finding was\n\nthat Roger Edwards had terminated the contract itself in November\n\n2001; for the period prior to that date, the jury found that Fiddes\n\nhad not violated whatever exclusive dealing rights it might have\n\ngranted.      Whether the product was mislabeled or not does not\n\nundermine either ruling in any way that Roger Edwards has been able\n\nto explain.\n\n           Similarly, the award on the counterclaim for unpaid\n\ninvoices rested on the fact that the goods had been delivered,\n\ntheir acceptance had not been timely revoked, and the invoices had\n\nnot been paid.     Roger Edwards said that it revoked acceptance of\n\nthe goods in December 2002, but then withdrew this revocation in\n\nMarch 2003 because of the alleged fraud.          But the magistrate judge\n\nfound that the time for a revocation-of-acceptance defense in the\n\ncase had passed by December 2002, making the purported March 2003\n\nwithdrawal of revocation irrelevant to the disposition of the\n\ncounterclaim.\n\n           Despite a good deal of case law saying that prejudice is\n\nrequired to reopen a judgment under Rule 60(b), Roger Edwards\n\nargued to the magistrate judge that the supposed misrepresentations\n\nwere \"fraud on the court\" and did not require a showing that Roger\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fEdwards' position in court had in fact been prejudiced.              The main\n\ncase cited for this view, Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford-Empire\n\nCo., 322 U.S. 238 (1944), involved conduct and circumstances\n\negregiously designed to corrupt the judicial process; the attempt\n\nof Roger Edwards to extend this precedent to cover any material\n\nmisstatement whatsoever was hopeless from the outset.\n\n           Roger Edwards also invoked the burden-shifting analysis\n\nin Anderson v. Cryovac, Inc., 862 F.2d 910 (1st Cir. 1988), under\n\nwhich a Rule 60(b)(3) movant who proves \"knowing or deliberate\"\n\nmisconduct benefits from a rebuttable presumption of the required\n\nprejudice.     Id.   at   926.    Yet     Roger   Edwards   proved    no   such\n\ndeliberate misconduct.      And even if it had, the presumption would\n\nhave been overcome by the evidence discussed above and in our Rule\n\n60(b) opinion showing that the alleged misconduct in fact had no\n\nimpact on the litigation.\n\n           So what we have are highly dubious charges of fraud\n\nwhich, in any event, are not effectively connected to any plausible\n\nshowing   of   the   necessary    prejudice.        No   reasonable    lawyer\n\nconsidering    a   Rule   60(b)   motion    could   suppose   that    such   a\n\ncombination had any chance of upsetting a final judgment reached\n\nafter extensive litigation and a defeat of Roger Edwards' claim in\n\ndifferent respects by both judge and jury.           The magistrate judge\n\n\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\facted within his discretion in deeming the motion \"frivolous\" and\n\nimposing sanctions.2\n\n              In addition to defending the district court's sanctions\n\naward in its favor for time spent opposing the Rule 60(b) motion,\n\nFiddes has moved for appellate sanctions under Fed. R. App. P. 38,\n\nwhich gives the court of appeals discretion to sanction frivolous\n\nappeals.      \"An appeal is frivolous if the result is obvious or the\n\narguments are 'wholly without merit.'\" Cronin v. Town of Amesbury,\n\n81 F.3d 257, 261 (1st Cir. 1996) (quoting Westcott Constr. Corp. v.\n\nFiremen's Fund of N.J., 996 F.2d 14, 17 (1st Cir. 1993)).\n\n              Our analysis under Rule 38 is somewhat different than\n\nthat under Rule 11.          First, we exercise our own independent\n\njudgment in assessing a possible Rule 38 violation, whereas we\n\ndefer    to   the   trial   judge's   judgment   when   reviewing   Rule   11\n\nsanctions.     Second, although a frivolous claim made before a trial\n\ncourt is unlikely to be rescued on appeal, the argument on appeal\n\nmight sometimes be different and more promising, although--apart\n\nfrom errors in process--this would surely be rare.\n\n              However, in this case we think that sanctions in this\n\ncourt are also appropriate.       To the extent Roger Edwards' brief on\n\n\n     2\n      At the time of the original appeal of the Rule 11 sanction,\nthe magistrate judge had not yet fixed the amount of the attorneys'\nfees comprising the sanction. Concerned as to whether the sanction\norder being appealed was a final judgment, we deferred a decision\nuntil the figure had been set, which the magistrate judge did in a\nlater order. Neither side has contested the amount of the award\n($4,553.10).\n\n                                      -10-\n\fappeal added to arguments made in the district court (e.g., the\n\nequitable estoppel argument presented on appeal but not in Roger\n\nEdwards' Rule 60(b) brief below), Roger Edwards had no reason to\n\nthink that these new arguments were preserved, see Daigle v. Me.\n\nMed. Ctr., Inc., 14 F.3d 684, 687-88 (1st Cir. 1994); to the extent\n\nthe arguments were the same, Roger Edwards' insistence on rehashing\n\nits   meritless   claims     yet   again    represents    just     the    sort   of\n\nvexatious behavior that Rule 38 is meant to discourage.                  See Maher\n\nv. Hyde, 272 F.3d 83, 87 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n           Even so we might hesitate, in the exercise of our own\n\ndiscretion, to grant a request for sanctions based on a meritless\n\nbrief in this court--of which a good many are filed each year--but\n\nfor two aggravating factors: that the Rule 60(b) motion and appeal\n\nwere themselves a second bite at the apple, and that Roger Edwards'\n\nopening   brief   on   the    Rule   60(b)    appeal     was   a   kitchen-sink\n\ncollection of weak or undeveloped arguments that failed to respond\n\nto the fatal weaknesses identified by the magistrate judge, and so\n\nburdened both opposing counsel and this court.\n\n           This present, third appeal--from the magistrate judge's\n\nsanctions order--was also hopeless and it is baffling that Roger\n\nEdwards did not settle the matter, as the magistrate judge urged,\n\nbefore a formal sanctions order was entered.                   But for obvious\n\nreasons we would be loath to sanction the appeal of a sanctions\n\n\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\forder save in extraordinary circumstances.     Thus, Fiddes ought not\n\nseek new appellate sanctions as to this third appeal.\n\n            The district court's award of Rule 11 sanctions is\n\naffirmed.    As for sanctions under Fed. R. App. P. 38, we award a\n\nflat sum of $1,500 in attorneys' fees to Fiddes for the defense of\n\nthe second appeal (No. 05-1306) and the preparation of its Rule 38\n\nmotion, plus double costs.      Much of the work done by Fiddes in the\n\ndistrict court Rule 60(b) proceeding could be adapted to the\n\nappeal, and a further round of filings to refine the amount\n\nprecisely will lead only to more expense.\n\n            It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\f",

The magistrate judge found (based on documents coupled with Roger Edwards' own admissions) that Roger Edwards had terminated the open-ended contract on November 19, 2001; he also granted Fiddes summary judgment on its counterclaim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These summary dispositions left open for trial the possibility that Fiddes was liable to Roger Edwards for the period prior to termination. The jury resolved liability for the pre-November 19 period by finding no breach by Fiddes before that date. The magistrate judge entered judgment for Fiddes on the jury verdict and awarded $17,286 to Fiddes on the counterclaim. On appeal, we found no error. <i>Roger Edwards I,</i> 387 F.3d at 97.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roger Edwards' Rule 60(b) motion was based on a double proposition: that Fiddes' products had been mislabeled in numerous respects&#8212;this is a shorthand version of the charge, which also included alleged improper documentation&#8212;and that, during the original merits case, Fiddes and its counsel had made misrepresentations in discovery and court filings by asserting that its products were in compliance with U.S. law. As proof of the former, Roger Edwards offered an expert affidavit; for the latter, it pointed to three statements in the proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the magistrate judge that the Rule 60(b) motion was hopeless. The background law as to what constitutes fraud under Rule 60(b), and as to pertinent incidents like time limits and prejudice, is admittedly no model of perfection; our own opinion on the appeal of the Rule 60(b) motion makes this clear while trying to sort out some of the problems. <i>See Roger Edwards II,</i> 427 F.3d at 132-34. If (against the background of somewhat fuzzy law) the Rule 60(b) motion might conceivably have succeeded, we would not uphold the sanction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difficulty for Roger Edwards is that the deficiencies in its motion went well beyond debatable inference and colorable legal argument. The affidavit offered to prove the mislabeling purported to identify numerous details in which the product had not conformed to a parade of regulations; but the only basis for the charge of <i>fraud</i> on the part of Fiddes in marketing the allegedly mislabeled product was the explicit, conclusory inference by the expert that alleged mistakes must have been dishonest because there were a lot of technical problems with the labeling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The further charges of fraud, based on the three litigation-related statements cited by Roger Edwards, were pitifully weak; even weaker were any inferences of reliance or other showings that the alleged fraud \"`substantially interfered with [the litigant's] ability fully and fairly to prepare for, and proceed at, trial.'\" <i>Tiller v. Baghdady,</i> 294 F.3d 277, 280 (1st Cir.2002) (quoting <i>Anderson v. Cryovac, Inc.,</i> 862 F.2d 910, 926 (1st Cir.1988)). Two of the statements are bland, unspecific denials, at most debatably \"inaccurate,\" as to which reliance by an experienced adversary is not credible; the third and more detailed statement is not even arguably false. <i>See Roger Edwards II,</i> 427 F.3d at 135-37.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More important to the issue of sanctions for the filing of the Rule 60(b) motion, the outcome of the motion would be no different even if there had been some basis for arguing that the product had been mislabeled and that Fiddes had misrepresented to the contrary in the course of the litigation. Roger Edwards was unable throughout the Rule 60(b) proceeding and the ensuing appeal to explain plausibly how such mislabeling would have altered <i>the judgment</i> being assailed on either the initial claim or the counterclaim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On Roger Edwards' affirmative contract claim (for breach of exclusive dealing rights), the magistrate judge's finding was that Roger Edwards had terminated the contract itself in November 2001; for the period prior to that date, the jury found that Fiddes had not violated whatever exclusive dealing rights it might have granted. Whether the product was mislabeled or not does not undermine either ruling in any way that Roger Edwards has been able to explain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the award on the counterclaim for unpaid invoices rested on the fact that the goods had been delivered, their acceptance had not been timely revoked, and the invoices had not been paid. Roger Edwards said that it revoked acceptance of the goods in December 2002, but then withdrew this revocation in March 2003 because of the alleged fraud. But the magistrate judge found that the time for a revocation-of-acceptance defense in the case had passed by December 2002, making the purported March 2003 withdrawal of revocation irrelevant to the disposition of the counterclaim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite a good deal of case law saying that prejudice is required to reopen a judgment under Rule 60(b), Roger Edwards argued to the magistrate judge that the supposed misrepresentations were \"fraud on the court\" and did not require a showing that Roger Edwards' position in court had in fact been prejudiced. The main case cited for this view, <i>Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co.,</i> 322 U.S. 238, 64 S.Ct. 997, 88 L.Ed. 1250 (1944), involved conduct and circumstances egregiously designed to corrupt the judicial process; the attempt of Roger Edwards to extend this precedent to cover any material misstatement whatsoever was hopeless from the outset.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roger Edwards also invoked the burden-shifting analysis in <i>Anderson v. Cryovac, Inc.,</i> 862 F.2d 910 (1st Cir.1988), under which a Rule 60(b)(3) movant who proves \"knowing or deliberate\" misconduct benefits from a rebuttable presumption of the required prejudice. <i>Id.</i> at 926. Yet Roger Edwards proved no such deliberate misconduct. And even if it had, the presumption would have been overcome by the evidence discussed above and in our Rule 60(b) opinion showing that the alleged misconduct in fact had no impact on the litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So what we have are highly dubious charges of fraud which, in any event, are not effectively connected to any plausible showing of the necessary prejudice. No reasonable lawyer considering a Rule 60(b) motion could suppose that such a combination had any chance of upsetting a final judgment reached after extensive litigation and a defeat of Roger Edwards' claim in different respects by both judge and jury. The magistrate judge acted within his discretion in deeming the motion \"frivolous\" and imposing sanctions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to defending the district court's sanctions award in its favor for time spent opposing the Rule 60(b) motion, Fiddes has moved for <i>appellate</i> sanctions under Fed. R.App. P. 38, which gives the court of appeals discretion to sanction frivolous appeals. \"An appeal is frivolous if the result is obvious or the arguments are `wholly without merit.'\" <i>Cronin v. Town of Amesbury,</i> 81 F.3d 257, 261 (1st Cir.1996) (quoting <i>Westcott Constr. Corp. v. Firemen's Fund of N.J.,</i> 996 F.2d 14, 17 (1st Cir.1993)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our analysis under Rule 38 is somewhat different than that under Rule 11. First, we exercise our own independent judgment in assessing a possible Rule 38 violation, whereas we defer to the trial judge's judgment when reviewing Rule 11 sanctions. Second, although a frivolous claim made before a trial court is unlikely to be rescued on appeal, the argument on appeal might sometimes be different and more promising, although&#8212;apart from errors in process&#8212;this would surely be rare.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, in this case we think that sanctions in this court are also appropriate. To the extent Roger Edwards' brief on appeal added to arguments made in the district court (<i>e.g.,</i> the equitable estoppel argument presented on appeal but not in Roger Edwards' Rule 60(b) brief below), Roger Edwards had no reason to think that these new arguments were preserved, <i>see Daigle v. Me. Med. Ctr., Inc.,</i> 14 F.3d 684, 687-88 (1st Cir.1994); to the extent the arguments were the same, Roger Edwards' insistence on rehashing its meritless claims yet again represents just the sort of vexatious behavior that Rule 38 is meant to discourage. <i>See Maher v. Hyde,</i> 272 F.3d 83, 87 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even so we might hesitate, in the exercise of our own discretion, to grant a request for sanctions based on a meritless brief in this court&#8212;of which a good many are filed each year&#8212;but for two aggravating factors: that the Rule 60(b) motion and appeal were themselves a second bite at the apple, and that Roger Edwards' opening brief on the Rule 60(b) appeal was a kitchen-sink collection of weak or undeveloped arguments that failed to respond to the fatal weaknesses identified by the magistrate judge, and so burdened both opposing counsel and this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This present, third appeal&#8212;from the magistrate judge's sanctions order&#8212;was also hopeless and it is baffling that Roger Edwards did not settle the matter, as the magistrate judge urged, before a formal sanctions order was entered. But for obvious reasons we would be loath to sanction the appeal of a sanctions order save in extraordinary circumstances. Thus, Fiddes ought not seek <i>new</i> appellate sanctions as to this third appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's award of Rule 11 sanctions is <i>affirmed.</i> As for sanctions under Fed. R.App. P. 38, we award a flat sum of $1,500 in attorneys' fees to Fiddes for the defense of the second appeal (No. 05-1306) and the preparation of its Rule 38 motion, plus double costs. Much of the work done by Fiddes in the district court Rule 60(b) proceeding could be adapted to the appeal, and a further round of filings to refine the amount precisely will lead only to more expense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>It is so ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> <i>See Roger Edwards, LLC v.

The magistrate judge found (based on documents coupled with Roger Edwards' own admissions) that Roger Edwards had terminated the open-ended contract on November 19, 2001; he also granted Fiddes summary judgment on its counterclaim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These summary dispositions left open for trial the possibility that Fiddes was liable to Roger Edwards for the period prior to termination. The jury resolved liability for the pre-November 19 period by finding no breach by Fiddes before that date. The magistrate judge entered judgment for Fiddes on the jury verdict and awarded $17,286 to Fiddes on the counterclaim. On appeal, we found no error. <i>Roger Edwards I,</i> 387 F.3d at 97.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roger Edwards' Rule 60(b) motion was based on a double proposition: that Fiddes' products had been mislabeled in numerous respects&#8212;this is a shorthand version of the charge, which also included alleged improper documentation&#8212;and that, during the original merits case, Fiddes and its counsel had made misrepresentations in discovery and court filings by asserting that its products were in compliance with U.S. law. As proof of the former, Roger Edwards offered an expert affidavit; for the latter, it pointed to three statements in the proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the magistrate judge that the Rule 60(b) motion was hopeless. The background law as to what constitutes fraud under Rule 60(b), and as to pertinent incidents like time limits and prejudice, is admittedly no model of perfection; our own opinion on the appeal of the Rule 60(b) motion makes this clear while trying to sort out some of the problems. <i>See Roger Edwards II,</i> 427 F.3d at 132-34. If (against the background of somewhat fuzzy law) the Rule 60(b) motion might conceivably have succeeded, we would not uphold the sanction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difficulty for Roger Edwards is that the deficiencies in its motion went well beyond debatable inference and colorable legal argument. The affidavit offered to prove the mislabeling purported to identify numerous details in which the product had not conformed to a parade of regulations; but the only basis for the charge of <i>fraud</i> on the part of Fiddes in marketing the allegedly mislabeled product was the explicit, conclusory inference by the expert that alleged mistakes must have been dishonest because there were a lot of technical problems with the labeling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The further charges of fraud, based on the three litigation-related statements cited by Roger Edwards, were pitifully weak; even weaker were any inferences of reliance or other showings that the alleged fraud \"`substantially interfered with [the litigant's] ability fully and fairly to prepare for, and proceed at, trial.'\" <i>Tiller v. Baghdady,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200016\"><a href=\"/opinion/200016/tiller-v-baghdady/\"><span class=\"volume\">294</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">277</span></a></span>, 280 (1st Cir.2002) (quoting <i>Anderson v. Cryovac, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"515444\"><a href=\"/opinion/515444/anne-anderson-v-cryovac-inc-anne-anderson-v-beatrice-foods-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">862</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">910</span></a></span>, 926 (1st Cir.1988)). Two of the statements are bland, unspecific denials, at most debatably \"inaccurate,\" as to which reliance by an experienced adversary is not credible; the third and more detailed statement is not even arguably false. <i>See Roger Edwards II,</i> 427 F.3d at 135-37.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More important to the issue of sanctions for the filing of the Rule 60(b) motion, the outcome of the motion would be no different even if there had been some basis for arguing that the product had been mislabeled and that Fiddes had misrepresented to the contrary in the course of the litigation. Roger Edwards was unable throughout the Rule 60(b) proceeding and the ensuing appeal to explain plausibly how such mislabeling would have altered <i>the judgment</i> being assailed on either the initial claim or the counterclaim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On Roger Edwards' affirmative contract claim (for breach of exclusive dealing rights), the magistrate judge's finding was that Roger Edwards had terminated the contract itself in November 2001; for the period prior to that date, the jury found that Fiddes had not violated whatever exclusive dealing rights it might have granted. Whether the product was mislabeled or not does not undermine either ruling in any way that Roger Edwards has been able to explain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the award on the counterclaim for unpaid invoices rested on the fact that the goods had been delivered, their acceptance had not been timely revoked, and the invoices had not been paid. Roger Edwards said that it revoked acceptance of the goods in December 2002, but then withdrew this revocation in March 2003 because of the alleged fraud. But the magistrate judge found that the time for a revocation-of-acceptance defense in the case had passed by December 2002, making the purported March 2003 withdrawal of revocation irrelevant to the disposition of the counterclaim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite a good deal of case law saying that prejudice is required to reopen a judgment under Rule 60(b), Roger Edwards argued to the magistrate judge that the supposed misrepresentations were \"fraud on the court\" and did not require a showing that Roger Edwards' position in court had in fact been prejudiced. The main case cited for this view, <i>Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103987\"><a href=\"/opinion/103987/hazel-atlas-co-v-hartford-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">322</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">64</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">997</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1250</span></span> (1944), involved conduct and circumstances egregiously designed to corrupt the judicial process; the attempt of Roger Edwards to extend this precedent to cover any material misstatement whatsoever was hopeless from the outset.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roger Edwards also invoked the burden-shifting analysis in <i>Anderson v. Cryovac, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"515444\"><a href=\"/opinion/515444/anne-anderson-v-cryovac-inc-anne-anderson-v-beatrice-foods-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">862</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">910</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1988), under which a Rule 60(b)(3) movant who proves \"knowing or deliberate\" misconduct benefits from a rebuttable presumption of the required prejudice. <i>Id.</i> at 926. Yet Roger Edwards proved no such deliberate misconduct. And even if it had, the presumption would have been overcome by the evidence discussed above and in our Rule 60(b) opinion showing that the alleged misconduct in fact had no impact on the litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So what we have are highly dubious charges of fraud which, in any event, are not effectively connected to any plausible showing of the necessary prejudice. No reasonable lawyer considering a Rule 60(b) motion could suppose that such a combination had any chance of upsetting a final judgment reached after extensive litigation and a defeat of Roger Edwards' claim in different respects by both judge and jury. The magistrate judge acted within his discretion in deeming the motion \"frivolous\" and imposing sanctions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to defending the district court's sanctions award in its favor for time spent opposing the Rule 60(b) motion, Fiddes has moved for <i>appellate</i> sanctions under Fed. R.App. P. 38, which gives the court of appeals discretion to sanction frivolous appeals. \"An appeal is frivolous if the result is obvious or the arguments are `wholly without merit.'\" <i>Cronin v. Town of Amesbury,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196706\"><a href=\"/opinion/196706/cronin-v-amesbury/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></a></span>, 261 (1st Cir.1996) (quoting <i>Westcott Constr. Corp. v. Firemen's Fund of N.J.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"609221\"><a href=\"/opinion/609221/westcott-construction-corp-v-firemens-fund-of-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1993)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our analysis under Rule 38 is somewhat different than that under Rule 11. First, we exercise our own independent judgment in assessing a possible Rule 38 violation, whereas we defer to the trial judge's judgment when reviewing Rule 11 sanctions. Second, although a frivolous claim made before a trial court is unlikely to be rescued on appeal, the argument on appeal might sometimes be different and more promising, although&#8212;apart from errors in process&#8212;this would surely be rare.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, in this case we think that sanctions in this court are also appropriate. To the extent Roger Edwards' brief on appeal added to arguments made in the district court (<i>e.g.,</i> the equitable estoppel argument presented on appeal but not in Roger Edwards' Rule 60(b) brief below), Roger Edwards had no reason to think that these new arguments were preserved, <i>see Daigle v. Me. Med. Ctr., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195171\"><a href=\"/opinion/195171/daigle-v-maine-medical/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">684</span></a></span>, 687-88 (1st Cir.1994); to the extent the arguments were the same, Roger Edwards' insistence on rehashing its meritless claims yet again represents just the sort of vexatious behavior that Rule 38 is meant to discourage. <i>See Maher v. Hyde,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199707\"><a href=\"/opinion/199707/maher-v-hyde/\"><span class=\"volume\">272</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, 87 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even so we might hesitate, in the exercise of our own discretion, to grant a request for sanctions based on a meritless brief in this court&#8212;of which a good many are filed each year&#8212;but for two aggravating factors: that the Rule 60(b) motion and appeal were themselves a second bite at the apple, and that Roger Edwards' opening brief on the Rule 60(b) appeal was a kitchen-sink collection of weak or undeveloped arguments that failed to respond to the fatal weaknesses identified by the magistrate judge, and so burdened both opposing counsel and this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This present, third appeal&#8212;from the magistrate judge's sanctions order&#8212;was also hopeless and it is baffling that Roger Edwards did not settle the matter, as the magistrate judge urged, before a formal sanctions order was entered. But for obvious reasons we would be loath to sanction the appeal of a sanctions order save in extraordinary circumstances. Thus, Fiddes ought not seek <i>new</i> appellate sanctions as to this third appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's award of Rule 11 sanctions is <i>affirmed.</i> As for sanctions under Fed. R.App. P. 38, we award a flat sum of $1,500 in attorneys' fees to Fiddes for the defense of the second appeal (No. 05-1306) and the preparation of its Rule 38 motion, plus double costs. Much of the work done by Fiddes in the district court Rule 60(b) proceeding could be adapted to the appeal, and a further round of filings to refine the amount precisely will lead only to more expense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>It is so ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> <i>See Roger Edwards, LLC v.
