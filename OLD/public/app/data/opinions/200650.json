These appeals involve claims of\n\npolitically motivated discharges.              The twenty-four plaintiffs, all\n\nformer employees of the Municipality of Gurabo (the Municipality),\n\nare members of the New Progressive Party (NPP).                   They sued three\n\ndefendants — the Municipality, its mayor, José A. Rivera Rodríguez\n\n(the Mayor), and its human resources director, Luz E. Rivera-Oyola\n\n—    under   42    U.S.C.     §    1983,       alleging    that      a    politically\n\ndiscriminatory animus accounted for their sudden unemployment.\n\n             The plaintiffs convinced both a jury and the district\n\ncourt   of   the   accuracy       of   this    claim;   the   jury       awarded   them\n\nsubstantial compensatory and punitive damages (enumerated in an\n\nappendix     to    this     opinion),      and    the     court      ordered       their\n\nreinstatement.      The defendants appeal, assigning error in a number\n\nof discrete respects. After a painstaking review of the voluminous\n\nrecord, we conclude that the combined effect of two errors requires\n\na new trial.        We also conclude that, as to Rivera-Oyola, the\n\ndistrict court erred in failing to grant judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw.    The tale follows.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n             This case has a lengthy history, chronicled in a pair of\n\nlucid opinions.      See Gómez Candelaria v. Rivera Rodríguez, 218 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 66 (D.P.R. 2002) (Gómez I) (denying defendants' motions\n\nfor summary judgment); Gómez Candelaria v. Rivera Rodríguez, 218 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 79 (D.P.R. 2002) (Gómez II) (denying defendants' motions\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\ffor post-trial relief).     We rehearse here only those details that\n\nhelp to frame the issues on appeal.\n\n          More   than   a   quarter-century     ago,   the   Puerto   Rico\n\nlegislature created \"a special fund, separate and distinct from all\n\nother moneys or funds of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\"        29 P.R.\n\nLaws Ann. § 711c(a) (1995) (Law 52).      This fund was to be\n\n          continually   at   the   disposition  of   the\n          Secretary [of the Treasury] solely and\n          exclusively for activities coordinated by the\n          Employment Service of the Department of Labor\n          and Human Resources directed to:           (1)\n          Promoting employment opportunities with future\n          possibilities as thus identified officially by\n          the Department of Labor and Human Resources;\n          (2) promoting jobs that are in demand in the\n          present market; (3) and promoting the creation\n          of high productivity employment opportunities.\n\nId. § 711c(b).   In practice, Law 52 soon became a vehicle through\n\nwhich the Commonwealth subsidized locally managed programs to\n\nameliorate unemployment.\n\n          Despite    this   local   emphasis,   municipalities   have   no\n\nautomatic entitlement to Law 52 grants.           To obtain funding, a\n\nmunicipality must submit a proposal describing how it intends to\n\nuse the money.      Because such proposals must be approved by the\n\nCommonwealth's Department of Labor and Human Resources (DLHR) from\n\nyear to year, jobs subsidized by Law 52 funds are transitory in\n\nnature, typically lasting for one year only.\n\n          Prior to the 2000 general election, the plaintiffs held\n\nmunicipal positions that had been created and funded under Law 52.\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fMost of them had been so employed, under serial one-year contracts,\n\nfor periods ranging from two to seven years.      The latest contracts\n\nwere due to expire on December 31, 2000.\n\n            The general election in November of 2000 included a race\n\nfor the mayor's office. Rivera Rodríguez stood for election as the\n\ncandidate of the Popular Democratic Party (PDP).         The plaintiffs\n\nopenly opposed his candidacy, participating unabashedly in partisan\n\nmarches, meetings, fundraisers, leaflet drops, and other political\n\nactivities.     Notwithstanding    the   plaintiffs'   efforts,    Rivera\n\nRodríguez defeated the incumbent NPP mayor, Victor Rivera Acevedo.\n\n            Prior to the inauguration, the outgoing administration\n\nsubmitted an updated Law 52 proposal to DLHR.     It also extended the\n\nplaintiffs' employment contracts through January 31, 2001.            The\n\nchanging of the guard took place on January 9, 2001, and the Mayor\n\nappointed Rivera-Oyola (a fellow PDP member) to the position of\n\nhuman    resources   director.    Soon   thereafter,   the   Municipality\n\nreceived word that DLHR would not approve the Law 52 proposal\n\npreviously submitted by the lame-duck administration.1            In lieu\n\nthereof, DLHR requested a reworked proposal based on the needs\n\nperceived by the new administration.      As of the expiration date of\n\nthe plaintiffs' contracts, no further Law 52 funds had been made\n\n\n\n     1\n      The PDP also had won the gubernatorial election in November\nof 2000 and its candidate had replaced an NPP incumbent. These\nfacts may or may not have contributed to the rejection of the\npending proposal.\n\n                                   -5-\n\favailable to the Municipality.                After discussing the lack of money\n\nwith Rivera-Oyola, the Mayor, by letter dated January 30, 2001,\n\nnotified the plaintiffs that their employment would cease the next\n\nday.2\n\n                   Shortly thereafter, the Municipality submitted a revamped\n\nLaw 52 proposal to DLHR.                The agency approved that proposal on\n\nFebruary 14, 2001.           The job descriptions had changed and, prior to\n\nfilling the newly sanctioned positions, the Mayor met with Luis\n\nPiñot Arecco (Piñot), DLHR's deputy secretary for legal affairs and\n\nnorms.        The ostensible purpose of the meeting was to discuss the\n\nground rules for the hiring of Law 52 employees.                              When the\n\nMunicipality eventually filled the new positions, the plaintiffs\n\nwere left out in the cold.\n\n                   Dismayed by these developments, the plaintiffs filed suit\n\nin the United States District Court for the District of Puerto\n\nRico.        They alleged, inter alia, that the Mayor and Rivera-Oyola\n\n(who        were    sued    in   both   their       individual    and    representative\n\ncapacities) had violated their freedoms of speech and association\n\nunder       the     First   Amendment    in     failing   to     renew   their   Law   52\n\n\n\n\n        2\n      The parties stipulated that although Rivera-Oyola drafted the\ntermination letters, she had no role in the decision not to renew\nthe plaintiffs' contracts. We discuss this stipulation in more\ndetail in a subsequent section of this opinion. See infra Part\nII(E).\n\n                                              -6-\n\femployment         contracts.3        The   defendants       denied   that    they   had\n\nviolated         the    plaintiffs'    rights,     asserting    that    the   disputed\n\nemployment decisions were the upshot of the new administration's\n\ndiffering policies as to how best to serve the needs of the\n\ncommunity.\n\n                 On January 22, 2002, the individual defendants moved for\n\nsummary judgment.              They asserted, inter alia, that the complaint\n\nshould be dismissed as to five of the plaintiffs because they had\n\nnot sought renewal of their contracts; that the complaint should be\n\ndismissed as to Rivera-Oyola because of the parties' stipulation\n\nthat       she    had    not    participated      in   the   decision    to   let    the\n\nplaintiffs' contracts expire, see supra note 2; and that the\n\ncomplaint should be dismissed as to the Mayor on the ground of\n\nqualified immunity because, given the guidance he had received from\n\nDLHR, it was objectively reasonable for him to believe that his\n\nconduct did not offend clearly established law.\n\n                 The district court rejected the defendants' motion as to\n\nthe five plaintiffs who did not seek reappointment, finding that\n\neach of them had a constitutionally protected property interest in\n\ncontinued employment.             In this regard, the court declared that:\n\n                 [W]hen there are funds available for renewal\n                 of Law 52 positions, transitory employees who\n\n\n       3\n      In a second amended complaint, the plaintiffs added Piñot and\nthe DLHR's Secretary (Victor Rivera Hernández) as defendants. We\nneed not dwell on this stratagem as the plaintiffs subsequently\ndropped these defendants.\n\n                                            -7-\n\f            have   been  continuously   re-employed   with\n            previous Law 52 grants and who have been for\n            all practical purposes refused re-employment,\n            have at that point a property interest in\n            their continued employment and therefore must\n            be allowed and are entitled to a pre-\n            termination    hearing.         Under    these\n            circumstances, if the contract of a Law 52\n            transitory employee is not renewed and another\n            person who is affiliated with a rival\n            political party is employed in his stead, the\n            Law 52 transitory employees (Plaintiffs in\n            this case) have a cause of action under the\n            law not only for political discrimination but\n            also for due process.\n\nGómez I, 218 F. Supp. 2d at 79.          The court also refused to dismiss\n\nthe complaint as to Rivera-Oyola, concluding that the record\n\ncontained facts that contradicted the stipulation and that her\n\nposition    inherently     \"has   more   influence    with   decision-making\n\nmatters than that of a general employee who merely follows orders.\"\n\nId. at 75.    The Mayor fared no better.          In eschewing a grant of\n\nbrevis disposition in the Mayor's favor on the ground of qualified\n\nimmunity,    the   court   noted    that    factual   disputes   as   to   his\n\nmotivation remained to be resolved.          Id. at 77.\n\n            The case proceeded to trial.          The plaintiffs' case in\n\nchief was largely circumstantial.          However, one plaintiff, Shirley\n\nMorales Rivera (Morales), testified over objection as to the\n\nsubstance of a conversation with the Mayor's wife, Mayra Pinero.\n\nAccording to this witness, Pinero stated (or, at least, intimated)\n\nthat party affiliation would play a part in the Municipality's\n\nhiring practices.\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\f            At the close of the plaintiffs' case, the defendants\n\nmoved unsuccessfully for the entry of judgment as a matter of law.\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 50(a).        Just before the opening of the defense\n\ncase, the plaintiffs moved in limine seeking to preclude Piñot's\n\ntestimony. The district court granted this motion, and the defense\n\nproceeded without the benefit of its star witness.\n\n             At the close of all the evidence, the defendants again\n\nmoved for judgment as a matter of law.              The court rejected the\n\nmotion.     The jury found for the plaintiffs; its verdict rested on\n\na     finding   that   political     affiliation    was   a   substantial      or\n\nmotivating factor in the decision not to renew the plaintiffs' Law\n\n52 contracts and/or not to recall them once DLHR had released the\n\nincremental Law 52 funds.          Gómez II, 218 F. Supp. 2d at 83.\n\n            Following    rendition     of   the    verdict,   the   individual\n\ncapacity defendants moved unsuccessfully for judgment as a matter\n\nof law, or in the alternative, a new trial.            See id. at 89.       These\n\nappeals followed (there are four, but the details need not concern\n\nus).     We granted the Secretary of DLHR leave to appear as amicus\n\ncuriae in connection with the district court's novel construction\n\nof Law 52.\n\nII.    ANALYSIS\n\n            The   Supreme   Court     has   been   unmistakably     clear    that\n\nnonpolicymaking public employees are constitutionally protected\n\nfrom adverse employment decisions on account of their political\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\faffiliation.      See Rutan v. Repub. Party, 497 U.S. 62, 75 (1990);\n\nBranti v. Finkel, 445 U.S. 507, 516-17 (1980); Elrod v. Burns, 427\n\nU.S. 347, 372-73 (1976) (plurality).          This constitutional doctrine\n\nis premised on the fact that politically motivated discharges\n\nimpinge on core freedoms protected by the First Amendment, such as\n\nfreedom of belief and freedom of association.            See Elrod, 427 U.S.\n\nat 355-58; Padilla-Garcia v. Guillermo Rodriguez, 212 F.3d 69, 74\n\n(1st Cir. 2000).\n\n           When     a      public   employee        advances     a      political\n\ndiscrimination claim against her employer, two principal questions\n\narise.   First, the court must determine whether the plaintiff is\n\nthe kind of employee whose job enjoys protection against political\n\npatronage.       See Branti, 445 U.S. at 517-20.               Basically, this\n\nprotection     extends     to   public    employees    who     occupy     neither\n\npolicymaking positions nor positions of unusual confidence.                   See\n\nVazquez Rios v. Hernandez Colon, 819 F.2d 319, 322-26 (1st Cir.\n\n1987).   We need not probe this point more deeply as the plaintiffs\n\nin this case held low-level jobs and the defendants have not\n\nclaimed that political affiliation was an appropriate criterion for\n\nmaking decisions vis-à-vis those jobs.\n\n           The    second    question     involves   causation:       whether    a\n\nplaintiff was denied, or banished from, public employment for\n\npolitical reasons.         This requires the plaintiff to show that\n\npolitical affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor in the\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fdecisional calculus.       Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v.\n\nDoyle, 429 U.S. 274, 287 (1977).           If the plaintiff satisfies this\n\nburden, the devoir of persuasion shifts to the defendants to prove\n\nthat they would have taken the same action regardless of the\n\nplaintiff's political affiliation. See Padilla-Garcia, 212 F.3d at\n\n74 (citing Mt. Healthy, 429 U.S. at 287).               The causation question\n\ntypically is grist for the factfinder's mill.              See Lewis v. City of\n\nBoston, 321 F.3d 207, 218-19 (1st Cir. 2003); see also Dedham Water\n\nCo. v. Cumberland Farms Dairy, Inc., 972 F.2d 453, 457 (1st Cir.\n\n1992).\n\n             In these appeals, the defendants' primary contention is\n\nthat   the   district     court   committed      crucial    instructional     and\n\nevidentiary errors that unfairly influenced the jury's resolution\n\nof the causation question.         In the pages that follow, we discuss a\n\nclaim of instructional error, two claims of evidentiary error, and\n\na claim that one defendant (Rivera-Oyola) was entitled to judgment\n\nas a matter of law.\n\n                     A.   Status of Law 52 Employees.\n\n             The   defendants     and   the    amicus   (whose   assistance   we\n\nappreciate) object to the district court's holding that Law 52\n\ncontract employees have a property interest in their continued\n\nemployment.    The court originally made this holding in denying the\n\ndefendants' motion for summary judgment, Gómez I, 218 F. Supp. 2d\n\n\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fat 77-79, and later instructed the jury to the same effect.               We\n\ndeal first with this point.\n\n            We begin with an explanation of why it makes a difference\n\nwhether a public employee has — or does not have — a property\n\ninterest in her employment. An employer usually can dismiss an at-\n\nwill employee without any special ceremony.            See Smith v. F.W.\n\nMorse & Co., 76 F.3d 413, 426 (1st Cir. 1996) (explaining that \"an\n\nemployer can give an at-will employee — even one who has been a\n\nstellar performer — her walking papers at any time, for any reason\n\nor no reason\"). A public employee may, however, acquire a property\n\ninterest in continued employment.          In that event, the employer\n\ncannot dismiss her (and, thus, deprive her of her property) without\n\naffording   her   due   process.4    See   Cleveland   Bd.   of   Educ.   v.\n\nLoudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 538 (1985).\n\n            Against this backdrop, we turn to the case at hand.           A\n\nconstitutionally protected property interest in continued public\n\nemployment typically arises when the employee has a reasonable\n\nexpectation that her employment will continue.         See, e.g., Rivera-\n\n\n\n     4\n      The due process issue may at first glance appear to be purely\nacademic, as the plaintiffs obtained complete relief on their First\nAmendment claims. We nonetheless treat this issue for two reasons.\nFirst, the case will have to be retried, see text infra, thus\nwiping the slate clean. Second, the district court seems to have\ngrounded its denial of brevis disposition vis-à-vis the five\nplaintiffs who did not seek renewal of their Law 52 contracts on\nits property interest holding.        Because that rationale is\ninsupportable, the status of these five plaintiffs will have to be\nreexamined by the district court.\n\n                                    -12-\n\fMuriente v. Agosto-Alicea, 959 F.2d 349, 352 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\nUnder    ordinary        circumstances,      an    at-will    employee     lacks     a\n\nreasonable expectation of continued employment (and, thus, has no\n\nproperty interest in her job).              King v. Town of Hanover, 116 F.3d\n\n965, 969 (1st Cir. 1997).             This is true of so-called transitory\n\npublic employees in Puerto Rico.              See, e.g., Nieves-Villanueva v.\n\nSoto-Rivera, 133 F.3d 92, 94 (1st Cir. 1997) (explaining that\n\n\"transitory employees generally do not have a property interest in\n\ncontinued employment beyond their yearly terms of appointment\");\n\nCaro v. Aponte-Roque, 878 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1989) (similar).\n\n            Despite this body of law, the district court concluded\n\nthat Law 52 employees enjoy a property interest in continued public\n\nemployment. In reaching this conclusion, the court recognized that\n\n\"a   property     interest      is   not    generally    granted     to   transitory\n\nemployee positions because these positions are created to fill an\n\nemployer need or to perform specific tasks of a finite duration.\"\n\nGómez I, 218 F. Supp. 2d at 78 (emphasis in original).                    The court\n\nregarded positions subsidized under Law 52 as an exception to this\n\nrule    because    the     \"transitory      nature[]\"    of   such   positions     is\n\n\"predicated       upon    the   approval      of   Law   52   proposals     and    the\n\nsubsequent availability of funds and [is] not based merely on\n\nemployer need.\"          Id. at 78-79.\n\n            Although we agree with the district court's premise — Law\n\n52 positions do depend to some extent on DLHR's approval of annual\n\n\n                                           -13-\n\fproposals and the concomitant release of funds — we cannot accept\n\nthe court's conclusion that individual employees are entitled to\n\nproperty interests in the positions themselves.          There is nothing\n\nin either the language or the legislative history of Law 52 that\n\nwould except positions subsidized thereunder from the operation of\n\nthe usual rule. The district court therefore erred in holding that\n\nthe plaintiffs had property interests in their Law 52 employment\n\nbeyond the stated duration of their annual contracts.5\n\n                        B.    Piñot's Testimony.\n\n          The next battleground that we visit concerns the district\n\ncourt's decision to bar the testimony of Piñot (whom both sides had\n\nidentified in the joint pretrial order as a fact witness to the\n\nevents leading to the Mayor's actions).         The court predicated its\n\ndecision on two grounds:       (1) that the defendants had failed to\n\nsubmit a written report detailing Piñot's intended testimony or\n\notherwise to satisfy the disclosure requirements imposed by Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P.   26,   and   (2)   that   Piñot's   testimony   would   inevitably\n\nencompass his interpretation of Law 52, thus encroaching on the\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      This determination in no way alters the First Amendment\nanalysis. Public employees can never be fired in violation of their\nFirst Amendment rights. \"Thus, the fact that a transitory employee\ndoes not have a reasonable expectation of renewal in his or her\nemployment . . . does not defeat a First Amendment claim.\" Nieves-\nVillanueva, 133 F.2d at 98; accord Cheveras Pacheco v. Rivera\nGonzalez, 809 F.2d 125, 127-29 (1st Cir. 1987) (holding that\ntransitory employees are entitled to protection under the\nElrod/Branti line of cases).\n\n                                    -14-\n\fjudge's domain.      Gómez II, 218 F. Supp. 2d at 87.         We test these\n\npremises.\n\n            1. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26.    The trial court worried that the\n\nproffered testimony was, in the court's own words, \"in actuality\n\nthat of an expert.\"    Based on this conclusion, the court ruled that\n\nPiñot could not testify because the defendants had neglected to\n\ncomply with the expert witness requirements of Rule 26. So viewed,\n\nthe preclusionary order was a sanction for a discovery violation,\n\nwhich we review for abuse of discretion.         Macaulay v. Anas, 321\n\nF.3d 45, 51 (1st Cir. 2003); Jackson v. Harvard Univ., 900 F.2d\n\n464, 469 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n            We start — and, in this case, stop — with the question\n\nwhether the district court abused its discretion in invoking the\n\nexpert witness requirements of Rule 26.       We approach this question\n\nmindful that a court abuses its discretion if it ignores a material\n\nfactor   deserving    significant   weight,   relies   upon    an   improper\n\nfactor, or assesses only the proper mix of factors but makes a\n\nserious mistake in evaluating them.        Indep. Oil and Chem. Workers\n\nof Quincy, Inc. v. Procter & Gamble Mfg. Co., 864 F.2d 927, 929\n\n(1st Cir. 1988). Superimposed on that rubric is the principle that\n\n\"mistakes of law . . . always constitute abuses of a court's\n\ndiscretion.\"    Gay Officers Action League v. Puerto Rico, 247 F.3d\n\n288, 292 (1st Cir. 2001).    For the reasons that follow, we conclude\n\n\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\fthat the district court misclassified the proffered testimony and,\n\naccordingly, erred as a matter of law.\n\n              Fed. R. Civ. P. 26 is an integral part of the machinery\n\ndevised to facilitate the management of pretrial discovery.                Among\n\nother things, the rule places on litigants an affirmative duty to\n\nfurnish, in advance of trial, \"the name . . . of each individual\n\nlikely to have discoverable information that the disclosing party\n\nmay use to support its claims or defenses . . . [and to] identif[y]\n\nthe subjects of the information.\"               Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(1)(A).\n\nThe record demonstrates that the instant defendants complied with\n\nthis provision.       In the joint pretrial order, they listed Piñot as\n\na potential witness, indicated his position with DLHR, and stated\n\nthat he would \"testify regarding the meeting held with [the Mayor]\n\nover the discussion of the 2001 Law No. 52 proposal approval, the\n\nguidance requested by the [Mayor] regarding the former employees\n\nand the criteria provided for the mentioned issue.\"               The statement\n\nleft   no   doubt     that   Piñot    was   a   fact   witness    who   possessed\n\ndiscoverable information.            See Cusumano v. Microsoft Corp., 162\n\nF.3d   708,    716    n.5    (1st    Cir.   1998)   (\"[T]o   be   discoverable,\n\ninformation need only appear to be 'reasonably calculated to lead\n\nto the discovery of admissible evidence.'\") (quoting Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 26(b)(1)).        No more was exigible.\n\n              It is true, of course, that Rule 26 delineates additional\n\nsafeguards with respect to expert testimony.                 For instance, the\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\frule obligates a party who wishes to offer such testimony to\n\ndisclose, during pretrial proceedings, \"the identity of any person\n\nwho may be used at trial to present evidence under Rules 702, 703\n\nand 705 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.\"                     Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n26(a)(2)(A).       Even more stringent requirements pertain to \"a\n\nwitness who is retained or specially employed to provide expert\n\ntestimony in the case or whose duties as an employee of the party\n\nregularly involve giving expert testimony.\"                    Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n26(a)(2)(B).       Such     a   witness   must   submit    a    written     report\n\ncontaining,      inter    alia,     detailed     information         as   to    the\n\nqualifications and intended testimony of the witness.                     Id.   The\n\ndefendants regarded Piñot as a fact witness, not an expert witness,\n\nand therefore omitted this information.\n\n              The district court disagreed with this taxonomy.                   It\n\nruled that the defendants had misclassified Piñot and had thereby\n\ntransgressed Rule 26.           We find this ruling insupportable:              the\n\nexpert witness requirements do not affect a witness in Piñot's\n\nposition.\n\n              Rule 26 uses the term expert \"to refer to those persons\n\nwho will testify under Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence\n\nwith   respect    to   scientific,     technical,   and    other      specialized\n\nmatters.\"      Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2) advisory committee's note to\n\nthe    1993   amendments.       That   definition   does       not   encompass    a\n\npercipient witness who happens to be an expert.            If the individual\n\n\n                                       -17-\n\fis not providing testimony under Rule 702, he is not an expert\n\nwitness for the purpose of Rule 26.    See id.\n\n          The advisory committee specifically used the example of\n\na treating physician to illustrate the sort of witness who may have\n\nspecialized knowledge yet need not be considered an expert for the\n\npurpose of submitting a report as part of pretrial discovery.     See\n\nid.   By and large, courts have followed the advisory committee's\n\nlead and ruled that a treating physician, testifying as to his\n\nconsultation with or treatment of a patient, is not an expert\n\nwitness for purposes of Rule 26.   See, e.g., NGO v. Stand. Tools &\n\nEquip. Co., 197 F.R.D. 263, 266 (D. Md. 2000); Mangla v. Univ. of\n\nRochester, 168 F.R.D. 137, 139 (W.D.N.Y. 1996); Sipes v. United\n\nStates, 111 F.R.D. 59, 61 (S.D. Cal. 1986).\n\n          The analogy is compelling. The record in this case makes\n\nmanifest that Piñot and the Mayor had met and discussed both the\n\nprocedure for filling the new Law 52 slots and the Municipality's\n\nobligations to the former employees well before the occasion for\n\nlitigation arose.      The Mayor claims that he acted on Piñot's\n\nadvice.   Unquestionably, then, Piñot was a direct participant in\n\nthe events at issue, and the record confirms that his testimony was\n\noffered to that end.    Like the testimony of a treating physician,\n\nPiñot's testimony would have been based on personal knowledge\n\nacquired before any litigation had begun.        He was an actor with\n\nregard to the occurrences from which the tapestry of the lawsuit\n\n\n                                -18-\n\fwas woven, and the defendants sought to present his testimony on\n\nthat basis.\n\n            The bottom line is that Piñot was a fact witness, and his\n\nfirst-hand    testimony        should    have   been     considered     under      the\n\nstandards that govern such witnesses — not under the special\n\nprovisions that apply to expert witnesses. Consequently, the trial\n\ncourt's conclusion that there had been a discovery violation rested\n\non a mistake of law.           It follows inexorably that the court lacked\n\nauthority    to    levy    the    preclusionary    sanction     —   there    was    no\n\ntransgression to punish.\n\n             Let    us    be     perfectly    clear.      Piñot     obviously      has\n\nspecialized knowledge by virtue of his position with DLHR and his\n\nchairmanship       of    the   board   that   assesses    and   approves     Law    52\n\nproposals.     But the triggering mechanism for application of Rule\n\n26's expert witness requirements is not the status of the witness,\n\nbut, rather, the essence of the proffered testimony.                        Patel v.\n\nGayes, 984 F.2d 214, 218 (7th Cir. 1993); Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)\n\nadvisory committee's note to the 1993 amendments.                   Accordingly, a\n\nparty need not identify a witness as an expert so long as the\n\nwitness played a personal role in the unfolding of the events at\n\nissue and the anticipated questioning seeks only to elicit the\n\nwitness's knowledge of those events.              See Patel, 984 F.2d at 217-\n\n18.   Piñot fit into this niche.                 Thus, Rule 26 afforded no\n\njustification for the wholesale exclusion of his testimony.\n\n\n                                        -19-\n\f           2.    Legal Opinion.          Although we find the wholesale\n\nexclusion of Piñot's lay testimony insupportable as a discovery\n\nsanction, the defendants have another obstacle to overcome.                When\n\ngranting the plaintiffs' motion in limine from the bench, the\n\ndistrict court commented that \"any factual testimony that [Piñot]\n\nmay offer [would be] inextricably conjoined to expert opinion and\n\ntestimony\";     that   the     witness    would,   in    effect,    wind     up\n\n\"interpret[ing] the law for the jury\"; and that this concatenation\n\nof circumstances would infringe upon the judge's role as \"the sole\n\ninterpreter of Law 52 when instructing the Jury on the law.\"                The\n\ncourt reiterated this point in rebuffing the defendants' post-trial\n\nmotions.   See Gómez II, 218 F. Supp. 2d at 87 (declaring that \"no\n\nwitness is allowed to interpret the law for the jury\").            In voicing\n\nthese sentiments, the court leaned heavily on our decision in\n\nNieves-Villanueva, 133 F.3d at 99 (describing as \"black-letter law\"\n\nthe postulate that it is for the judge, not the witnesses, to\n\ninform the jurors as to the applicable law).              We deem this an\n\nalternative basis for excluding Piñot's testimony, and, thus,\n\ninquire into it.\n\n           We evaluate a trial court's decision to admit or exclude\n\nevidence for abuse of discretion.         Pendleton v. City of Haverhill,\n\n156 F.3d 57, 64 (1st Cir. 1998). This deferential standard applies\n\nbecause    \"[e]very    trial    presents     a   blend   of   idiosyncratic\n\ncircumstances\" — a reality that counsels in favor of affording the\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\fpresider some appreciable latitude in making evidentiary findings.\n\nUnited States v. Zaccaria, 240 F.3d 75, 78 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\nDespite the deference that is due, we are of the view that the\n\ncourt below went too far when it banned Piñot from testifying at\n\nall on the ground that his testimony would embody inadmissible\n\nlegal opinion.     Our reasoning follows.\n\n          Courts    generally   have    held   legal   opinion    testimony\n\ninadmissible under Fed. R. Evid. 702. See, e.g., Specht v. Jensen,\n\n853 F.2d 805, 807-10 (10th Cir. 1988) (en banc); Marx & Co. v.\n\nDiners' Club, Inc., 550 F.2d 505, 508-11 (2d Cir. 1977).          But these\n\ncases are inapposite here.       As we already have explained, the\n\ndefendants proposed to call Piñot as a fact witness, not an expert\n\nwitness under Rule 702.     See supra Part II(B)(1).\n\n          The fact that Piñot was a percipient witness makes a\n\nworld of difference.      Assuming for the sake of argument that\n\nNieves-Villanueva announced a general evidentiary rule to the\n\neffect that legal opinion testimony is per se inadmissible,6 that\n\nrule would not be implicated in these circumstances.             After all,\n\nthe rationale for excluding legal opinions is directed at excluding\n\ntestimony as to ultimate legal conclusions. Thus, courts have held\n\nthat a witness cannot testify that an appointment was made in\n\n\n     6\n      There is good reason to believe that Nieves-Villanueva did\nnot announce such a per se rule. See Nieves-Villanueva, 133 F.3d\nat 100 (discussing why expert legal opinions do not assist the\ntrier of fact — a discussion that would have been unnecessary if\nthe testimony were per se inadmissible).\n\n                                 -21-\n\fviolation of the law, e.g., Nieves-Villanueva, 133 F.3d at 99, or\n\nthat a search was unreasonable and thus illegal, e.g., Specht, 853\n\nF.2d at 808, or that contractual obligations have a particular\n\nlegal effect, e.g., Marx & Co., 550 F.2d at 508.   But courts \"draw\n\na clear line between permissible testimony on issues of fact and\n\ntestimony that articulates the ultimate principles of law governing\n\nthe deliberations of the jury.\"   Specht, 853 F.2d at 808.\n\n          Piñot's proposed testimony clearly falls on the sunny\n\nside of this line.   While his testimony was not admissible for the\n\npurpose of proving what obligations the law imposed upon the Mayor,\n\nit was admissible to show the Mayor's understanding at the time and\n\nhis ensuing state of mind.    See United States v. Cavin, 39 F.3d\n\n1299, 1309 (5th Cir. 1994).\n\n          Of course, Piñot's testimony — like all testimony — would\n\nhave been subject to the balancing test mandated by Evidence Rule\n\n403 (which allows exclusion of relevant evidence \"if its probative\n\nvalue is substantially outweighed by the danger of . . . confusion\n\nof the issues[] or misleading the jury\").   But the district court\n\ndid not rely upon Rule 403 in excluding Piñot's testimony, and, in\n\nall events, the wholesale exclusion of that testimony cannot be\n\njustified under Rule 403.     The Rule 403 balancing test applies\n\nstatement by statement.   See Kassel v. Gannett Co., 875 F.2d 935,\n\n952 (1st Cir. 1989) (noting that the trial court \"must balance the\n\nprejudicial effect and probative value of each statement offered\").\n\n\n                                -22-\n\fTo use the rule as an instrument for the wholesale exclusion of a\n\npercipient witness's testimony would be tantamount to allowing the\n\npresider to cut down the entire tree out of fear that some of the\n\nfruit might prove rotten.     Rule 403 requires more delicate pruning\n\nof evidentiary proffers.7     See id. (warning against throwing \"out\n\nthe baby with the bath water\").\n\n            That ends this aspect of the matter.        Although Piñot may\n\nwell have testified as to the legal advice that he gave the Mayor,\n\nthat is not the kind of legal opinion testimony that the case law\n\ndeems wholly inadmissible.        Accordingly, the blanket exclusion of\n\nPiñot's   testimony   constituted     an   abuse   of   the   trial     court's\n\ndiscretion.\n\n                        C.   The Mayor's Wife.\n\n            The defendants also assert that the trial court erred in\n\nallowing Morales's testimony as to the substance of discussions she\n\nclaims to have had with the Mayor's wife (Pinero).                      Morales\n\ntestified over objection that Pinero interviewed her in an office\n\nin the town hall; that Pinero queried Morales's escort as to\n\nwhether she (Morales) was a member of the PDP; and that, after\n\nreceiving   an   assurance   of   Morales's   political       fealty,    Pinero\n\nexpressed an interest in hiring Morales as her secretary. She then\n\n\n     7\n      By the same token, Piñot's testimony would have been subject\nto limiting instructions. See United States v. Nivica, 887 F.2d\n1110, 1119 (1st Cir. 1989). But the need to limit the jury's use\nof certain testimony does not give the trial court carte blanche to\nexclude it entirely.\n\n                                    -23-\n\fasked for Morales's full name, stated that \"Law 52 was going to be\n\napproved,\" and indicated that this created an opportunity for the\n\nnew administration to hire PDP adherents.\n\n          The plaintiffs offered this testimony to prove the truth\n\nof the matter asserted, i.e., that the defendants acted out of a\n\npolitically discriminatory animus in allowing the plaintiffs' Law\n\n52 contracts to expire and in filling the new jobs with PDP\n\npartisans.     Because Pinero was not a party to the case, the\n\ntestimony, on its face, was garden-variety hearsay.      See Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 801(c) (\"'Hearsay' is a statement, other than one made by the\n\ndeclarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in\n\nevidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\").   As such, it\n\nwas inadmissible unless it somehow escaped the normal hearsay\n\nprohibition.    To avoid this bar, the plaintiffs posited that\n\nPinero's statements were not hearsay because they constituted\n\nadmissions of a party-opponent.8 The defendants objected, pointing\n\nto the lack of an adequate foundation.   To counter this objection,\n\nthe plaintiffs insisted that Pinero was a member of the Mayor's\n\ninner circle (and, therefore, an agent of the defendants).\n\n\n\n\n     8\n      The applicable Evidence Rule provides in relevant part that\na \"statement is not hearsay if . . . [it] is offered against a\nparty and is . . . a statement by the party's agent or servant\nconcerning a matter within the scope of the agency or employment,\nmade during the existence of the relationship.\"     Fed. R. Evid.\n801(d).\n\n                               -24-\n\f              The district court overruled the defendants' objections,\n\nreasoning that \"Mayor Rivera's wife was in fact an extension of the\n\nMayor, and did in fact hold a position within the Municipality of\n\nGurabo that was akin to his alter ego.\"                 The jury was then allowed\n\nto hear Morales's version of the conversation.                   The district court\n\nreiterated its earlier conclusion in the course of denying the\n\ndefendants'     post-trial       motions,          recalling    that    it   had    heard\n\n\"repeated     testimony       that    [Pinero]       occupied    an    office      at   the\n\nMunicipality\"      and    that        she    \"was     conducting       interviews        of\n\nprospective employees on behalf of the Mayor.\"                        Gómez II, 281 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 88.           The court then stated that it was \"common\n\nknowledge that wives of politicians often occupy positions of power\n\nand prestige within the government alongside their husbands.\"                           Id.\n\nWe examine this ruling for abuse of discretion. See Pendleton, 156\n\nF.3d at 64.\n\n              Parties wishing to introduce statements into evidence\n\nunder   the    aegis     of    Rule    801(d)(2)(D)       must    establish,        by    a\n\npreponderance of the evidence, (1) that an agency relationship\n\nexisted; (2) that the statements were made during the course of the\n\nrelationship; and (3) that the statements relate to matters within\n\nthe scope of the agency.             Larch v. Mansfield Mun. Elec. Dep't, 272\n\nF.3d 63, 72 (1st Cir. 2001).                Although the Evidence Rules do not\n\ndefine \"agent\" or \"servant,\" federal courts grappling with Rule\n\n801(d)(2)(D) proffers have adopted and applied the traditional\n\n\n                                            -25-\n\fmeanings of those terms as reflected in the federal common law of\n\nagency. See, e.g., City of Tuscaloosa v. Harcros Chems., Inc., 158\n\nF.3d 548, 557 n.9 (11th Cir. 1998); Lippay v. Christos, 996 F.2d\n\n1490, 1497 (3d Cir. 1993).9\n\n           It is hornbook law that an agency cannot be proven solely\n\nby the unsupported out-of-court statements of the claimed agent.\n\nAlthough   the   contents   of   the   putative   agent's   out-of-court\n\nstatements may be considered in the decisional calculus, the\n\nstatements \"are not alone sufficient to establish the declarant's\n\nauthority.\"   Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2).     For present purposes, then,\n\nMorales's testimony cannot be viewed as self-authenticating.          An\n\nagency relationship must be shown to exist by independent evidence\n\nbefore out-of-court statements by a purported agent can be deemed\n\nadmissions by a party-opponent. Mackey v. Burke, 751 F.2d 322, 326\n\nn.3 (10th Cir. 1984); United States v. Portsmouth Paving Corp., 694\n\nF.2d 312, 321 (4th Cir. 1982).\n\n           Faced with the need to identify independent foundational\n\nfacts, the plaintiffs point out that the determination of whether\n\na party has built a proper foundation is left principally to the\n\n\n\n     9\n      There is some play in the joints as to what a proponent must\nadduce to show that an agency relationship in fact existed.\nCompare, e.g., United States v. Rioux, 97 F.3d 648, 660 (2d Cir.\n1996) (requiring only that one is answerable and responsible to\nanother), with, e.g., Lippay, 996 F.2d at 1499 (requiring\n\"continuous, supervisory control\"). We need not dwell upon such\nfine distinctions:    the record here is devoid of any evidence\nsufficient to support a finding of agency under either standard.\n\n                                  -26-\n\fsound discretion of the presider. See United States v. Saccoccia,\n\n58 F.3d 754, 782 (1st Cir. 1995).       Although we accept that truism,\n\nthe trial court's discretion is not boundless.         See Ruiz-Troche v.\n\nPepsi Cola of P.R. Bottling Co., 161 F.3d 77, 83 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\nAt a bare minimum, the requisite foundation demands something more\n\nthan intuitive judgments emanating from broad generalities.             See\n\nKissinger v. Lofgren, 836 F.2d 678, 683 (1st Cir. 1988) (stating\n\nthat   a   proper   foundation   requires     the   proponent   to   adduce\n\n\"'evidence sufficient to support a finding' that the evidence is\n\nwhat the proponent claims it to be\") (quoting 5 J. Weinstein & M.\n\nBerger, Weinstein's Evidence, ¶ 901(a)); see also Fed. R. Evid.\n\n104(b).    Here, there is no \"more.\"\n\n            We have combed the record in this case and discovered no\n\nindependent     evidence   sufficient    to   establish   the    requisite\n\nfoundation.     To be sure, the district court said that Pinero was\n\nconducting interviews of prospective employees on the Mayor's\n\nbehalf.    Apart from Morales's testimony, however, there is nothing\n\nto show that Pinero interviewed Morales (or any other prospective\n\nemployee, for that matter) on behalf of the Mayor.         By like token,\n\nthe court suggested that it \"ha[d] to allow [the] testimony\"\n\nbecause, \"as the wife of the new Mayor,\"        Pinero \"was in charge of\n\nthe political operations of the Municipality of Gurabo at the\n\ntime.\"     This too is an uncorroborated ipse dixit; there is simply\n\nno proof that the Municipality, as a governmental entity, engaged\n\n\n                                  -27-\n\fin \"political operations\" under the hegemony of the Mayor's wife\n\neither   in    this   administration   or   as   a     matter   of    custom   and\n\npractice.      Nor is the fact that Pinero had a town hall office at\n\nher   disposal    sufficient   to   furnish      the    missing      foundational\n\nsupport.       In the ordinary course of events, many persons are\n\nassigned offices at the seat of government — but that placement\n\ndoes not confer wide-ranging authority upon all of them.                  To the\n\nextent that Pinero had political duties or responsibilities, the\n\nrecord does not contain any enumeration of them.\n\n              Similarly, Pinero's marriage to the Mayor, without more,\n\ndoes not demonstrate the formation of an agency relationship\n\nbetween them.     The mere existence of a marital bond cannot serve as\n\na proxy for competent proof of an agency relationship. Cf. Gannett\n\nv. Carp (In re Carp), ___ F.3d ___, ___ (1st Cir. 2003) [No. 02-\n\n2323, slip op. at 17] (noting that \"[t]he sins of the husband are\n\nnot automatically visited upon the wife\").             While we are not blind\n\nto political realities — we recognize that spouses of elected\n\nofficials can, and often do, exercise influence in matters of\n\npublic concern — generalizations are no substitute for hard facts.\n\nSee Blake v. Pellegrino, 329 F.3d 43, 48 (1st Cir. 2003).                 In this\n\ncase, the absence of particularized evidence dooms the plaintiffs'\n\nargument.\n\n              In making this assessment, we find unhelpful the district\n\ncourt's statement that Pinero \"was part of the political group that\n\n\n                                    -28-\n\fhad taken over the new administration.\"        For aught that appears,\n\nthat statement is based only on Pinero's PDP ties and her support\n\nfor her husband's candidacy.        If this were sufficient to make\n\nPinero an agent of either the Mayor or the Municipality, then any\n\nmember of the PDP would so qualify.        That is not the law.        See\n\nRestatement (Second) of Agency § 1 (1958) (defining agency).\n\n           In an effort to locate the missing link, the plaintiffs\n\nnote that the Mayor testified during his deposition that his wife\n\nregularly collects information for him.        That comment, offered in\n\nresponse to a question asking \"in what way does your wife help you\n\nin . . . municipal affairs?,\" fails to prove the plaintiffs' point.\n\nWhen the interrogator inquired further, the Mayor made it clear\n\nthat his wife's role was social in nature and that she played no\n\npart in the making of employment decisions.\n\n           To say more on this point would be supererogatory.\n\nBecause the record reveals no evidence sufficient to sustain a\n\nfinding that Pinero acted as an agent for either the Mayor or the\n\nMunicipality in connection with the hiring of Law 52 employees, the\n\ndistrict   court   abused   its   discretion   in   failing   to   exclude\n\nMorales's testimony as hearsay.      See, e.g., Am. Eagle Ins. Co. v.\n\nThompson, 85 F.3d 327, 333 (8th Cir. 1996); Lippay, 996 F.2d at\n\n1496-99.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -29-\n\f                      D.   Effect of the Errors.\n\n          We turn now to the cumulative effect of these errors.\n\nThe analytic framework is familiar:         a district court's error\n\nnecessitates a new trial only if it affects the complaining party's\n\nsubstantial rights.    See Fed. R. Civ. P. 61.       In general — the\n\nexceptions are not applicable here — this standard requires that\n\nthe challenged ruling has had a substantial and injurious effect or\n\ninfluence upon the jury's verdict.       Ruiz-Troche, 161 F.3d at 87.\n\nTo make this determination, a reviewing court must scrutinize the\n\nrecord as a whole and aggregate the collective effects of multiple\n\nerrors. See United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1195-96 (1st\n\nCir. 1993).    If the verdict is to stand, the court must be able to\n\nsay with a fair degree of assurance that the error(s) did not skew\n\nthe verdict.    Ruiz-Troche, 161 F.3d at 87.\n\n          We have thus far identified three errors, but the first\n\nof these is anchored in quicksand.      The district court's erroneous\n\n\"property interest\" ruling first manifested itself in its denial of\n\nsummary judgment.    Gómez I, 218 F. Supp. 2d at 78-79.    That order\n\nis unappealable at this juncture.       The law is clear that, after\n\ntrial, the denial of summary judgment merges into the verdict and\n\ncannot be assigned as error. See Rivera-Torres v. Ortiz-Velez, ___\n\nF.3d ___, ___ (1st Cir. 2003) [No. 02-2539, slip op. at 9-11];\n\nIacobucci v. Boulter, 193 F.3d 14, 22 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -30-\n\f            The erroneous \"property interest\" ruling also cropped up\n\nin the district court's jury instructions.           An incorrect jury\n\ninstruction   is,    of   course,   appealable.     Here,   however,   the\n\ndefendants did not interpose a contemporaneous objection to the\n\nfaulty instruction.       See Fed. R. Civ. P. 51.    Consequently, they\n\ndid not preserve their claim of error.        We have held fast to the\n\nproposition that \"silence after instructions . . . typically\n\nconstitutes a waiver of any objections.\"            Wilson v. Maritime\n\nOverseas Corp., 150 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 1998) (citing Putnam\n\nResources v. Pateman, 958 F.2d 448, 456 (1st Cir. 1992)).         That is\n\nprecisely what transpired here.\n\n            While a forfeited claim of error (such as a claim of\n\ninstructional error unaccompanied by a contemporaneous objection)\n\nis almost always subject to plain error review, Chestnut v. City of\n\nLowell, 305 F.3d 18, 20 (1st Cir. 2002) (en banc) (per curiam),\n\nthat is a rigorous standard to satisfy, see United States v.\n\nDuarte, 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir. 2001) (explaining that \"[r]eview\n\nfor plain error entails four showings:       (1) that an error occurred\n\n(2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the\n\ndefendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the\n\nfairness,     integrity,     or     public   reputation     of   judicial\n\nproceedings\").      In a nutshell, the defendants would have to show\n\nnot only that the instructional error was obvious but also that the\n\ninjustice was great.\n\n\n                                    -31-\n\f           Courts ought not to decide difficult, highly nuanced\n\nissues unnecessarily.   In this instance, prudence dictates that we\n\nrefrain from opining whether the defective instruction sinks to the\n\nlevel of plain error. Because the record contains other cognizable\n\nerrors that in and of themselves require a new trial, see text\n\ninfra, we are content to allow our comments on the \"property\n\ninterest\" ruling to stand as a guide to the district court on\n\nretrial.   See Rosaly v. Ignacio, 593 F.2d 145, 147-48 (1st Cir.\n\n1979) (employing a similar strategy).\n\n           This brings us to the two evidentiary bevues (both of\n\nwhich were properly preserved).       In employment discrimination\n\ncases, the factors that motivate a decision are central to the\n\ndecisionmaker's liability in his personal capacity.10   See Acevedo-\n\nGarcia v. Vera-Monroig, 204 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir. 2000) (stating\n\nthat a political discrimination claim \"has no meaning absent the\n\nallegation of impermissible motivation\"); see also Gómez I, 218 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 77 (recognizing that \"the information possessed by the\n\ndefendant\" is an important variable in that equation) (quoting\n\nKelley v. LaForce, 288 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2002)).   So viewed, the\n\ntrial court's order barring Piñot's testimony in its entirety went\n\nto the heart of the contested issue.       That testimony was the\n\n\n\n     10\n      Because the Mayor sets policy for the Municipality, Rivera-\nTorres, ___ F.3d at ___ [slip op. at 33-36], the preclusion of\nPiñot's testimony also impacted the Municipality (and, thus, the\n\"official capacity\" defendants).\n\n                               -32-\n\flinchpin of the Mayor's claim that his actions were objectively\n\nreasonable; it would have corroborated the Mayor's version of why\n\nhe did what he did.     Consequently, its exclusion was plainly\n\nprejudicial.   See   Cavin,   39    F.3d   at    1309   (finding   that   the\n\nexclusion of expert testimony regarding the considerations that\n\nface an attorney whose client is using his services to perpetrate\n\nfraud was reversible error as it \"prevent[ed] the lawyer from\n\neffectively presenting his defense\"); cf. Blake, 329 F.3d at 49\n\n(finding prejudicial error when the trial court withheld evidence\n\nfrom the jury on matters that were vital to the case).\n\n          Here, moreover, the nisi prius court compounded the\n\nharmful effect of this error by refusing to allow the Mayor to\n\ntestify as to the particular advice that he received from Piñot.\n\nWhen defense counsel pointedly protested that the aim of this line\n\nof questioning \"was to ask [the Mayor] what did he do and what his\n\nunderstanding, good or wrong,\" might be, the court responded that\n\nthe Mayor could not \"say anything as to the law . . . [or why] he\n\nthought he was not violating any law.\"          That ruling was erroneous,\n\nsee supra Part II(B)(2), and accentuated the harm resulting from\n\nthe wholesale exclusion of Piñot's testimony.\n\n          In fairness, the court did allow the Mayor to \"testify\n\nthat after he prepared the proposal[,] he asked for advice of the\n\nSecretary of Labor and after the advice given, he implemented the\n\nproposal accordingly. . . .   He can say that he followed the advice\n\n\n                                   -33-\n\f. . . without explaining . . . .\"   Although this was a step in the\n\nright direction, we agree with the defendants that it was not in\n\nany sense a satisfactory surrogate for Piñot's testimony.         A\n\nreasonable juror could as easily draw from this skeletal framework\n\nthe conclusion that the Mayor sought legal advice on how to slake\n\nhis thirst for political revenge in a way that would survive a\n\nlegal challenge.   The disallowance of Piñot's testimony prevented\n\nthe Mayor from placing factual flesh on these bare bones.\n\n            The trial court's error in allowing Morales's testimony\n\nwas the final nail in the coffin. Without Pinero's statements, the\n\nplaintiffs' case was entirely circumstantial.   With that evidence,\n\nthe plaintiffs had the benefit of the proverbial \"smoking gun.\"\n\nWhile circumstantial evidence can be sufficient for burden-shifting\n\npurposes in a discrimination case, see Desert Palace, Inc. v.\n\nCosta, 123 S. Ct. 2148, 2154-55 (2003), the distinction between\n\ncircumstantial evidence and direct evidence can still be extremely\n\nimportant in front of a jury.   Among other things, direct evidence\n\ncan play a pivotal role in shifting the factfinder's attention from\n\nthe credibility of the employee's complaint to the credibility of\n\nthe employer's affirmative defense.    See Tyler v. Bethlehem Steel\n\nCorp., 958 F.2d 1176, 1185 (2d Cir. 1992).   Given the likely impact\n\nof this rather powerful evidence, we cannot say with confidence\n\nthat the jury would have reached the same verdict had it been\n\nexcluded.\n\n\n                                -34-\n\f            To    summarize     succinctly,      we   hold   that    the   court's\n\nwholesale    exclusion    of     Piñot's       testimony,    coupled      with   the\n\nadmission of Morales's hearsay testimony, constituted prejudicial\n\nerror. Since there is an unacceptably high risk that these rulings\n\nin cumulation tipped the decisional scales, the verdict cannot\n\nstand.\n\n                           E.    The Stipulation.\n\n            Although we have found a new trial necessary, we still\n\nmust address Rivera-Oyola's claim that she should not be part of\n\nthat proceeding.       She asserts that she is entitled to judgment\n\nbecause of Stipulated Fact No. 19 (the Stipulation), which states:\n\n\"While executing or implementing the Mayor's order to not renew the\n\nPlaintiffs'       contracts,     defendant       Rivera-Oyola       was    strictly\n\nfollowing orders.      She had no participation in the act or official\n\ndecision not to renew Plaintiffs' contracts.\"                       She questions\n\nwhether, in light of this stipulation, she could be found to have\n\nbeen culpably involved in any constitutional violation.\n\n            The    district     court    determined    that    the     Stipulation\n\nconflicted with Stipulated Fact No. 22 (reciting that Rivera-Oyola\n\n\"drafted the Law 52 employees' termination letters\") and Stipulated\n\nFact No. 23 (reciting that she and the Mayor \"discussed Plaintiffs'\n\nemployment\"). Additionally, the court reasoned that Rivera-Oyola's\n\nposition required her to share her views with the Mayor and\n\n\n\n\n                                        -35-\n\fcollaborate with him in the formulation of policy.11             Accordingly,\n\nthe court denied Rivera-Oyola's timely motions for summary judgment\n\nand judgment as a matter of law.         Rivera-Oyola renewed the latter\n\nmotion after trial, but the district court again denied it.               Gómez\n\nII, 278 F. Supp. 2d at 86.\n\n               Because the court erroneously found a conflict where none\n\nexisted and thus declined to enter judgment as a matter of law, we\n\nreverse and order the claims against Rivera-Oyola in her individual\n\ncapacity dismissed.12      We explain briefly.\n\n               Stipulations in litigation are favored because they tend\n\nto expedite trial proceedings, eliminate the need for proving\n\nessentially       uncontested   facts,     and   husband    scarce   judicial\n\nresources.      See T I Fed. Credit Union v. DelBonis, 72 F.3d 921, 928\n\n(1st    Cir.    1995).    Determining    the     meaning   and   effect   of   a\n\nstipulation presents a question of law, engendering de novo review.\n\nBraxton v. United States, 500 U.S. 344, 350 (1991).              The question\n\n\n\n       11\n      In this regard, the court noted that Rivera-Oyola held a\nposition that was classified as a position of trust or confidence\nunder local law, see generally Vazquez Rios, 819 F.2d at 322-26,\nand cited a statute indicating that such employees \"collaborate\nsubstantially in the formulation of . . . public policy\" and\n\"advise directly\" the head of the governmental unit. 3 P.R. Laws\nAnn. § 1350 (2000).\n       12\n      The claims against Rivera-Oyola in her official capacity are\nessentially claims against the Municipality, see, e.g., Nereida-\nGonzalez v. Tirado-Delgado, 990 F.2d 701, 705 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"An\nofficial capacity suit is, in reality, a suit against a government\nentity, not against the governmental actor.\"), and are thus\nunaffected by this conclusion.\n\n                                    -36-\n\fis not whether the stipulation can be read in a way that supports\n\nthe decision of the trial court, but, rather, whether the trial\n\ncourt read the stipulation correctly.             Id.\n\n             Stipulations are best \"understood as the analogue of\n\nterms binding parties to a contract.\"             T I Fed. Credit Union, 72\n\nF.3d at 928.        Accordingly, the interpretation of a stipulation\n\nfollows general contract law principles.            See id.       It is axiomatic\n\nthat a contractual term should be construed in the context of the\n\ncontract as a whole. See Newport Plaza Assocs. v. Durfee Attleboro\n\nBank (In re Newport Plaza Assocs.), 985 F.2d 640, 646 (1st Cir.\n\n1993).   Every term should be given effect, and, thus, separate\n\nclauses should be reconciled whenever possible. See FDIC v. Singh,\n\n977   F.2d   18,    24   (1st   Cir.    1992);   see    also    Keystone   Fabric\n\nLaminates, Inc. v. Fed. Ins. Co., 407 F.2d 1353, 1356 (3d Cir.\n\n1969).\n\n             Rivera-Oyola asseverates that the Stipulation made it\n\ncrystal clear that her role was purely ministerial (and, thus, non-\n\nculpable).         The   district      court   rejected    this    asseveration,\n\nconcluding that the Stipulation conflicted with other stipulated\n\nfacts and, therefore, left a jury question.               But a fair reading of\n\nthe Stipulation reveals no conflict at all.                    A person (say, a\n\nsecretary) can draft a dismissal letter and discuss the terminated\n\nemployment with her boss without in any way participating in the\n\ndecision to discharge the affected employee.\n\n\n                                        -37-\n\f               The statutory job description relied on by the district\n\ncourt, see supra note 11, in no way alters this analysis.                      As a\n\nmatter of interpretation, specific terms typically trump general\n\nones.    See Edmond v. United States, 520 U.S. 651, 657 (1997); Paul\n\nRevere Variable Annuity Ins. Co. v. Kirschhofer, 226 F.3d 15, 21\n\nn.8 (1st Cir. 2000).           Here, the parties crafted the Stipulation to\n\ncapture what had occurred on a particular occasion. That certainly\n\ncarries far more weight than does a general statutory description\n\nthat applies to a myriad of situations and a host of government\n\nemployees.\n\n               In all events, the statutory description is not in\n\nconflict with the Stipulation.               Rivera-Oyola may well formulate\n\npolicy and provide advice in a large number of areas (including\n\npersonnel matters).            The Stipulation simply acknowledges that she\n\ntook    no   part    in    a    particular    set    of    employment   decisions.\n\nCounseled parties freely agreed upon this language, and we see no\n\nreason either to disturb or to distort the plain meaning of the\n\nlanguage that they chose.\n\n               The plaintiffs argue that the Stipulation should be\n\ndiscounted because there are facts in evidence that conflict with\n\nit.     That argument lacks force.           For one thing, the plaintiffs do\n\nnot    point    to   any   specific     piece       of    evidence   that   actually\n\ncontradicts the Stipulation.            For another thing, the very purpose\n\nof a stipulation is to dispense with the need for proof of the\n\n\n                                        -38-\n\fstipulated fact.       Burstein v. United States, 232 F.2d 19, 23 (8th\n\nCir. 1956).    Thus, no evidence tending to establish facts contrary\n\nto the facts stipulated can be considered.           See Gander v. Livoti,\n\n250 F.3d 606, 609 (8th Cir. 2001).            If the plaintiffs wished to\n\nshow Rivera-Oyola's personal involvement in the decisionmaking\n\nprocess — a fact that would have conflicted directly with the\n\nStipulation     —    they   were    obliged   to   seek    relief   from   the\n\nStipulation.      See Burstein, 232 F.2d at 23.      Absent such a request\n\n— and none was made in this case — the Stipulation is binding upon\n\nthe parties and the court.         See FDIC v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins.\n\nCo., 942 F.2d 1032, 1038 (6th Cir. 1991).\n\n            We are left only to determine the legal effect of the\n\nStipulation.        For the plaintiffs to show a deprivation of their\n\nconstitutional rights — a finding necessary to recover under\n\nsection 1983 — they had to prove that discrimination substantially\n\nmotivated   the     defendant's     adverse   employment   decisions.      Mt.\n\nHealthy, 429 U.S. at 287. In a political discrimination case, this\n\nrequired proof that the actor (here, Rivera-Oyola) intended to\n\ndiscriminate.       Rivera-Torres, ___ F.3d at ___ [slip op. at 19-20];\n\nFeliciano-Angulo v. Rivera-Cruz, 858 F.2d 40, 45-46 (1st Cir.\n\n1988); cf. Chavez v. Martinez, 123 S. Ct. 1994, 2000 (2003) (\"In\n\ndeciding whether an officer is entitled to qualified immunity, we\n\nmust first determine whether the officer's alleged conduct violated\n\na constitutional right.\").\n\n\n                                      -39-\n\f            For purposes of this case, then, Rivera-Oyola cannot be\n\npersonally liable to the plaintiffs unless she had a hand in the\n\ndecision not to renew their Law 52 contracts and/or honor their\n\napplications for the newly created positions. There is no evidence\n\nat all that she participated in the hiring process.       Thus, the case\n\nagainst her hinges on her role in the termination of the existing\n\nLaw 52 agreements.     The Stipulation defines that role.     Giving the\n\nwords their natural meaning, the Stipulation makes manifest that\n\nRivera-Oyola    had    no   hand   in   the   relevant   decisionmaking.\n\nConsequently, there is no way that the plaintiffs can carry their\n\nburden of showing that she was motivated by a constitutionally\n\nimpermissible animus (and, thus, that she is subject to section\n\n1983 liability).      For this reason, the district court should have\n\ngranted her motion for judgment as a matter of law and dismissed\n\nthe claims against her in her individual capacity.\n\nIII.    CONCLUSION\n\n            We need go no further.13 This was an enormously difficult\n\ncase, and the able trial judge was forced to wrestle with a\n\nseemingly endless series of complex decisions.           In such cases,\n\nperfect judicial scorecards are rare.         Here, the court's errors\n\nwere of sufficient magnitude to undermine confidence in the jury's\n\n\n       13\n      Although the appellants advance other assignments of error,\nthey involve either matters that are informed by this opinion (and,\nthus, unlikely to be repeated) or matters relating to remediation\n(and, thus, mooted by the vacation of the judgment). Consequently,\nwe need not deal with them.\n\n                                   -40-\n\fverdict.   We have no principled choice, therefore, but to reverse\n\nthe   judgment   and   to   direct   that   the   case   be   retried.   The\n\nexception, of course, is the action against Rivera-Oyola in her\n\nindividual capacity, which ought to be dismissed.\n\n\n\n           Reversed and remanded with instructions.           Costs shall be\n\ntaxed in favor of the defendants.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -41-\n\f                             APPENDIX\n\n\n\n         PLAINTIFF              DEFENDANT*       AMOUNT AWARDED\n\n\n\n1.

The twenty-four plaintiffs, all former employees of the Municipality of Gurabo (the Municipality), are members of the New Progressive Party (NPP). They sued three defendants &#8212; the Municipality, its mayor, Jos&#233; A. Rivera Rodr&#237;guez (the Mayor), and its human resources director, Luz E. Rivera-Oyola &#8212; under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, alleging that a politically discriminatory animus accounted for their sudden unemployment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs convinced both a jury and the district court of the accuracy of this claim; the jury awarded them substantial compensatory and punitive damages (enumerated in an appendix to this opinion), and the court ordered their reinstatement. The defendants appeal, assigning error in a number of discrete respects. After a painstaking review of the voluminous record, we conclude that the combined effect of two errors requires a new trial. We also conclude that, as to Rivera-Oyola, the district court erred in failing to grant judgment as a matter of law. The tale follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case has a lengthy history, chronicled in a pair of lucid opinions. <i>See G&#243;mez Candelaria v. Rivera Rodr&#237;guez,</i> 218 F.Supp.2d 66 (D.P.R.2002) (<i>G&#243;mez I</i>) (denying defendants' motions for summary judgment); <i>G&#243;mez Candelaria v. Rivera Rodr&#237;guez,</i> 218 F.Supp.2d 79 (D.P.R.2002) (<i>G&#243;mez II</i>) (denying defendants' motions for post-trial relief). We rehearse here only those details that help to frame the issues on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More than a quarter-century ago, the Puerto Rico legislature created \"a special fund, separate and distinct from all other moneys or funds of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\" 29 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 711c(a) (1995) (Law 52). This fund was to be</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">continually at the disposition of the Secretary [of the Treasury] solely and exclusively for activities coordinated by the Employment Service of the Department of Labor and Human Resources directed to: (1) Promoting employment opportunities with future possibilities as thus identified officially by the Department of Labor and Human Resources; (2) promoting jobs that are in demand in the present market; (3) and promoting the creation of high productivity employment opportunities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> &#167; 711c(b). In practice, Law 52 soon became a vehicle through which the Commonwealth subsidized locally managed programs to ameliorate unemployment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite this local emphasis, municipalities have no automatic entitlement to Law 52 grants. To obtain funding, a municipality must submit a proposal describing how it intends to use the money. Because such proposals must be approved by the Commonwealth's Department of Labor and Human Resources (DLHR) from year to year, jobs subsidized by Law 52 funds are transitory in nature, typically lasting for one year only.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to the 2000 general election, the plaintiffs held municipal positions that had been created and funded under Law 52. Most of them had been so employed, under serial one-year contracts, for periods ranging from two to seven years. The latest contracts were due to expire on December 31, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The general election in November of 2000 included a race for the mayor's office. Rivera Rodr&#237;guez stood for election as the candidate of the Popular Democratic Party (PDP). The plaintiffs openly opposed his candidacy, participating unabashedly in partisan marches, meetings, fundraisers, leaflet drops, and other political activities. Notwithstanding the plaintiffs' efforts, Rivera Rodr&#237;guez defeated the incumbent NPP mayor, Victor Rivera Acevedo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to the inauguration, the outgoing administration submitted an updated Law 52 proposal to DLHR. It also extended the plaintiffs' employment contracts through January 31, 2001. The changing of the guard took place on January 9, 2001, and the Mayor appointed Rivera-Oyola (a fellow PDP member) to the position of human resources director. Soon thereafter, the Municipality received word that DLHR would not approve the Law 52 proposal previously submitted by the lameduck administration.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In lieu thereof, DLHR requested a reworked proposal based on the needs perceived by the new administration. As of the expiration date of the plaintiffs' contracts, no further Law 52 funds had been made available to the Municipality. After discussing the lack of money with Rivera-Oyola, the Mayor, by letter dated January 30, 2001, notified the plaintiffs that their employment would cease the next day.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly thereafter, the Municipality submitted a revamped Law 52 proposal to DLHR. The agency approved that proposal on February 14, 2001. The job descriptions had changed and, prior to filling the newly sanctioned positions, the Mayor met with Luis Pi&#241;ot Arecco (Pi&#241;ot), DLHR's deputy secretary for legal affairs and norms. The ostensible purpose of the meeting was to discuss the ground rules for the hiring of Law 52 employees. When the Municipality eventually filled the new positions, the plaintiffs were left out in the cold.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dismayed by these developments, the plaintiffs filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. They alleged, inter alia, that the Mayor and Rivera-Oyola (who were sued in both their individual and representative capacities) had violated their freedoms of speech and association under the First Amendment in failing to renew their Law 52 employment contracts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The defendants denied that they had violated the plaintiffs' rights, asserting that the disputed employment decisions were the upshot of the new administration's differing policies as to how best to serve the needs of the community.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 22, 2002, the individual defendants moved for summary judgment. They asserted, inter alia, that the complaint should be dismissed as to five of the plaintiffs because they had not sought renewal of their contracts; that the complaint should be dismissed as to Rivera-Oyola because of the parties' stipulation that she had not participated in the decision to let the plaintiffs' contracts expire, <i>see supra</i> note 2; and that the complaint should be dismissed as to the Mayor on the ground of qualified immunity because, given the guidance he had received from DLHR, it was objectively reasonable for him to believe that his conduct did not offend clearly established law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected the defendants' motion as to the five plaintiffs who did not seek reappointment, finding that each of them had a constitutionally protected property interest in continued employment. In this regard, the court declared that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[W]hen there are funds available for renewal of Law 52 positions, transitory employees who have been continuously re-employed with previous Law 52 grants and who have been for all practical purposes refused re-employment, have at that point a property interest in their continued employment and therefore must be allowed and are entitled to a pre-termination hearing. Under these circumstances, if the contract of a Law 52 transitory employee is not renewed and another person who is affiliated with a rival political party is employed in his stead, the Law 52 transitory employees (Plaintiffs in this case) have a cause of action under the law not only for political discrimination but also for due process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>G&#243;mez I,</i> 218 F.Supp.2d at 79. The court also refused to dismiss the complaint as to Rivera-Oyola, concluding that the record contained facts that contradicted the stipulation and that her position inherently \"has more influence with decision-making matters than that of a general employee who merely follows orders.\" <i>Id.</i> at 75. The Mayor fared no better. In eschewing a grant of brevis disposition in the Mayor's favor on the ground of qualified immunity, the court noted that factual disputes as to his motivation remained to be resolved. <i>Id.</i> at 77.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case proceeded to trial. The plaintiffs' case in chief was largely circumstantial. However, one plaintiff, Shirley Morales Rivera (Morales), testified over objection as to the substance of a conversation with the Mayor's wife, Mayra Pinero. According to this witness, Pinero stated (or, at least, intimated) that party affiliation would play a part in the Municipality's hiring practices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the close of the plaintiffs' case, the defendants moved unsuccessfully for the entry of judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a). Just before the opening of the defense case, the plaintiffs moved in limine seeking to preclude Pi&#241;ot's testimony. The district court granted this motion, and the defense proceeded without the benefit of its star witness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the close of all the evidence, the defendants again moved for judgment as a matter of law. The court rejected the motion. The jury found for the plaintiffs; its verdict rested on a finding that political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor in the decision not to renew the plaintiffs' Law 52 contracts and/or not to recall them once DLHR had released the incremental Law 52 funds. <i>G&#243;mez II,</i> 218 F.Supp.2d at 83.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following rendition of the verdict, the individual capacity defendants moved unsuccessfully for judgment as a matter of law, or in the alternative, a new trial. <i>See id.</i> at 89. These appeals followed (there are four, but the details need not concern us). We granted the Secretary of DLHR leave to appear as amicus curiae in connection with the district court's novel construction of Law 52.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has been unmistakably clear that nonpolicymaking public employees are constitutionally protected from adverse employment decisions on account of their political affiliation. <i>See Rutan v. Repub. Party,</i> 497 U.S. 62, 75, 110 S.Ct. 2729, 111 L.Ed.2d 52 (1990); <i>Branti v. Finkel,</i> 445 U.S. 507, 516-17, 100 S.Ct. 1287, 63 L.Ed.2d 574 (1980); <i>Elrod v. Burns,</i> 427 U.S. 347, 372-73, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976) (plurality). This constitutional doctrine is premised on the fact that politically motivated discharges impinge on core freedoms protected by the First Amendment, such as freedom of belief and freedom of association. <i>See Elrod,</i> 427 U.S. at 355-58, 96 S.Ct. 2673; <i>Padilla-Garcia v. Guillermo Rodriguez,</i> 212 F.3d 69, 74 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a public employee advances a political discrimination claim against her employer, two principal questions arise. First, the court must determine whether the plaintiff is the kind of employee whose job enjoys protection against political patronage. <i>See Branti,</i> 445 U.S. at 517-20, 100 S.Ct. 1287. Basically, this protection extends to public employees who occupy neither policymaking positions nor positions of unusual confidence. <i>See Vazquez Rios v. Hernandez Colon,</i> 819 F.2d 319, 322-26 (1st Cir.1987). We need not probe this point more deeply as the plaintiffs in this case held low-level jobs and the defendants have not claimed that political affiliation was an appropriate criterion for making decisions vis-&#224;-vis those jobs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second question involves causation: whether a plaintiff was denied, or banished from, public employment for political reasons. This requires the plaintiff to show that political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor in the decisional calculus. <i>Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle,</i> 429 U.S. 274, 287, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977). If the plaintiff satisfies this burden, the devoir of persuasion shifts to the defendants to prove that they would have taken the same action regardless of the plaintiff's political affiliation. <i>See Padilla-Garcia,</i> 212 F.3d at 74 (citing <i>Mt. Healthy,</i> 429 U.S. at 287, 97 S.Ct. 568). The causation question typically is grist for the factfinder's mill. <i>See Lewis v. City of Boston,</i> 321 F.3d 207, 218-19 (1st Cir.2003); <i>see also Dedham Water Co. v. Cumberland Farms Dairy, Inc.,</i> 972 F.2d 453, 457 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In these appeals, the defendants' primary contention is that the district court committed crucial instructional and evidentiary errors that unfairly influenced the jury's resolution of the causation question. In the pages that follow, we discuss a claim of instructional error, two claims of evidentiary error, and a claim that one defendant (Rivera-Oyola) was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Status of Law 52 Employees.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants and the amicus (whose assistance we appreciate) object to the district court's holding that Law 52 contract employees have a property interest in their continued employment. The court originally made this holding in denying the defendants' motion for summary judgment, <i>G&#243;mez I,</i> 218 F.Supp.2d at 77-79, and later instructed the jury to the same effect. We deal first with this point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with an explanation of why it makes a difference whether a public employee has &#8212; or does not have &#8212; a property interest in her employment. An employer usually can dismiss an at-will employee without any special ceremony. <i>See Smith v. F.W. Morse &amp; Co.,</i> 76 F.3d 413, 426 (1st Cir.1996) (explaining that \"an employer can give an at-will employee &#8212; even one who has been a stellar performer &#8212; her walking papers at any time, for any reason or no reason\"). A public employee may, however, acquire a property interest in continued employment. In that event, the employer cannot dismiss her (and, thus, deprive her of her property) without affording her due process.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill,</i> 470 U.S. 532, 538, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 84 L.Ed.2d 494 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, we turn to the case at hand. A constitutionally protected property interest in continued public employment typically arises when the employee has a reasonable expectation that her employment will continue. <i>See, e.g., Rivera-Muriente v. Agosto-Alicea,</i> 959 F.2d 349, 352 (1st Cir.1992). Under ordinary circumstances, an at-will employee lacks a reasonable expectation of continued employment (and, thus, has no property interest in her job). <i>King v. Town of Hanover,</i> 116 F.3d 965, 969 (1st Cir.1997). This is true of so-called transitory public employees in Puerto Rico. <i>See, e.g., Nieves-Villanueva v. Soto-Rivera,</i> 133 F.3d 92, 94 (1st Cir.1997) (explaining that \"transitory employees generally do not have a property interest in continued employment beyond their yearly terms of appointment\"); <i>Caro v. Aponte-Roque,</i> 878 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1989) (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite this body of law, the district court concluded that Law 52 employees enjoy a property interest in continued public employment. In reaching this conclusion, the court recognized that \"a property interest is not <i>generally</i> granted to transitory employee positions because these positions are created to fill an employer need or to perform specific tasks of a finite duration.\" <i>G&#243;mez I,</i> 218 F.Supp.2d at 78 (emphasis in original). The court regarded positions subsidized under Law 52 as an exception to this rule because the \"transitory nature[]\" of such positions is \"predicated upon the approval of Law 52 proposals and the subsequent availability of funds and [is] not based merely on employer need.\" <i>Id.</i> at 78-79.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we agree with the district court's premise &#8212; Law 52 positions do depend to some extent on DLHR's approval of annual proposals and the concomitant release of funds &#8212; we cannot accept the court's conclusion that individual employees are entitled to property interests in the positions themselves. There is nothing in either the language or the legislative history of Law 52 that would except positions subsidized thereunder from the operation of the usual rule. The district court therefore erred in holding that the plaintiffs had property interests in their Law 52 employment beyond the stated duration of their annual contracts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Pi&#241;ot's Testimony.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next battleground that we visit concerns the district court's decision to bar the testimony of Pi&#241;ot (whom both sides had identified in the joint pretrial order as a fact witness to the events leading to the Mayor's actions). The court predicated its decision on two grounds: (1) that the defendants had failed to submit a written report detailing Pi&#241;ot's intended testimony or otherwise to satisfy the disclosure requirements imposed by Fed.R.Civ.P. 26, and (2) that Pi&#241;ot's testimony would inevitably encompass his interpretation of Law 52, thus encroaching on the judge's domain. <i>G&#243;mez II,</i> 218 F.Supp.2d at 87. We test these premises.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Fed.R.Civ.P. 26.</i> The trial court worried that the proffered testimony was, in the court's own words, \"in actuality that of an expert.\" Based on this conclusion, the court ruled that Pi&#241;ot could not testify because the defendants had neglected to comply with the expert witness requirements of Rule 26. So viewed, the preclusionary order was a sanction for a discovery violation, which we review for abuse of discretion. <i>Macaulay v. Anas,</i> 321 F.3d 45, 51 (1st Cir.2003); <i>Jackson v. Harvard Univ.,</i> 900 F.2d 464, 469 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start &#8212; and, in this case, stop &#8212; with the question whether the district court abused its discretion in invoking the expert witness requirements of Rule 26. We approach this question mindful that a court abuses its discretion if it ignores a material factor deserving significant weight, relies upon an improper factor, or assesses only the proper mix of factors but makes a serious mistake in evaluating them. <i>Indep. Oil and Chem. Workers of Quincy, Inc. v. Procter &amp; Gamble Mfg. Co.,</i> 864 F.2d 927, 929 (1st Cir.1988). Superimposed on that rubric is the principle that \"mistakes of law . . . always constitute abuses of a court's discretion.\" <i>Gay Officers Action League v. Puerto Rico,</i> 247 F.3d 288, 292 (1st Cir.2001). For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the district court misclassified the proffered testimony and, accordingly, erred as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 26 is an integral part of the machinery devised to facilitate the management of pretrial discovery. Among other things, the rule places on litigants an affirmative duty to furnish, in advance of trial, \"the name . . . of each individual likely to have discoverable information that the disclosing party may use to support its claims or defenses . . . [and to] identif[y] the subjects of the information.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(1)(A). The record demonstrates that the instant defendants complied with this provision. In the joint pretrial order, they listed Pi&#241;ot as a potential witness, indicated his position with DLHR, and stated that he would \"testify regarding the meeting held with [the Mayor] over the discussion of the 2001 Law No. 52 proposal approval, the guidance requested by the [Mayor] regarding the former employees and the criteria provided for the mentioned issue.\" The statement left no doubt that Pi&#241;ot was a fact witness who possessed discoverable information. <i>See Cusumano v. Microsoft Corp.,</i> 162 F.3d 708, 716 n. 5 (1st Cir.1998) (\"[T]o be discoverable, information need only appear to be `reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.'\") (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(1)). No more was exigible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true, of course, that Rule 26 delineates additional safeguards with respect to expert testimony. For instance, the rule obligates a party who wishes to offer such testimony to disclose, during pretrial proceedings, \"the identity of any person who may be used at trial to present evidence under Rules 702, 703 and 705 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(2)(A). Even more stringent requirements pertain to \"a witness who is retained or specially employed to provide expert testimony in the case or whose duties as an employee of the party regularly involve giving expert testimony.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(2)(B). Such a witness must submit a written report containing, inter alia, detailed information as to the qualifications and intended testimony of the witness. <i>Id.</i> The defendants regarded Pi&#241;ot as a fact witness, not an expert witness, and therefore omitted this information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court disagreed with this taxonomy. It ruled that the defendants had misclassified Pi&#241;ot and had thereby transgressed Rule 26. We find this ruling insupportable: the expert witness requirements do not affect a witness in Pi&#241;ot's position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 26 uses the term expert \"to refer to those persons who will testify under Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence with respect to scientific, technical, and other specialized matters.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(2) advisory committee's note to the 1993 amendments. That definition does not encompass a percipient witness who happens to be an expert. If the individual is not providing testimony under Rule 702, he is not an expert witness for the purpose of Rule 26. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The advisory committee specifically used the example of a treating physician to illustrate the sort of witness who may have specialized knowledge yet need not be considered an expert for the purpose of submitting a report as part of pretrial discovery. <i>See id.</i> By and large, courts have followed the advisory committee's lead and ruled that a treating physician, testifying as to his consultation with or treatment of a patient, is not an expert witness for purposes of Rule 26. <i>See, e.g., NGO v. Stand. Tools &amp; Equip. Co.,</i> 197 F.R.D. 263, 266 (D.Md.2000); <i>Mangla v. Univ. of Rochester,</i> 168 F.R.D. 137, 139 (W.D.N.Y. 1996); <i>Sipes v. United States,</i> 111 F.R.D. 59, 61 (S.D.Cal.1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The analogy is compelling. The record in this case makes manifest that Pi&#241;ot and the Mayor had met and discussed both the procedure for filling the new Law 52 slots and the Municipality's obligations to the former employees well before the occasion for litigation arose. The Mayor claims that he acted on Pi&#241;ot's advice. Unquestionably, then, Pi&#241;ot was a direct participant in the events at issue, and the record confirms that his testimony was offered to that end. Like the testimony of a treating physician, Pi&#241;ot's testimony would have been based on personal knowledge acquired before any litigation had begun. He was an actor with regard to the occurrences from which the tapestry of the lawsuit was woven, and the defendants sought to present his testimony on that basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bottom line is that Pi&#241;ot was a fact witness, and his first-hand testimony should have been considered under the standards that govern such witnesses &#8212; not under the special provisions that apply to expert witnesses. Consequently, the trial court's conclusion that there had been a discovery violation rested on a mistake of law. It follows inexorably that the court lacked authority to levy the preclusionary sanction &#8212; there was no transgression to punish.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let us be perfectly clear. Pi&#241;ot obviously has specialized knowledge by virtue of his position with DLHR and his chairmanship of the board that assesses and approves Law 52 proposals. But the triggering mechanism for application of Rule 26's expert witness requirements is not the status of the witness, but, rather, the essence of the proffered testimony. <i>Patel v. Gayes,</i> 984 F.2d 214, 218 (7th Cir.1993); Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a) advisory committee's note to the 1993 amendments. Accordingly, a party need not identify a witness as an expert so long as the witness played a personal role in the unfolding of the events at issue and the anticipated questioning seeks only to elicit the witness's knowledge of those events. <i>See Patel,</i> 984 F.2d at 217-18. Pi&#241;ot fit into this niche. Thus, Rule 26 afforded no justification for the wholesale exclusion of his testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Legal Opinion.</i> Although we find the wholesale exclusion of Pi&#241;ot's lay testimony insupportable as a discovery sanction, the defendants have another obstacle to overcome. When granting the plaintiffs' motion in limine from the bench, the district court commented that \"any factual testimony that [Pi&#241;ot] may offer [would be] inextricably conjoined to expert opinion and testimony\"; that the witness would, in effect, wind up \"interpret[ing] the law for the jury\"; and that this concatenation of circumstances would infringe upon the judge's role as \"the sole interpreter of Law 52 when instructing the Jury on the law.\" The court reiterated this point in rebuffing the defendants' post-trial motions. <i>See G&#243;mez II,</i> 218 F.Supp.2d at 87 (declaring that \"no witness is allowed to interpret the law for the jury\"). In voicing these sentiments, the court leaned heavily on our decision in <i>Nieves-Villanueva,</i> 133 F.3d at 99 (describing as \"black-letter law\" the postulate that it is for the judge, not the witnesses, to inform the jurors as to the applicable law). We deem this an alternative basis for excluding Pi&#241;ot's testimony, and, thus, inquire into it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We evaluate a trial court's decision to admit or exclude evidence for abuse of discretion. <i>Pendleton v. City of Haverhill,</i> 156 F.3d 57, 64 (1st Cir.1998). This deferential standard applies because \"[e]very trial presents a blend of idiosyncratic circumstances\" &#8212; a reality that counsels in favor of affording the presider some appreciable latitude in making evidentiary findings. <i>United States v. Zaccaria,</i> 240 F.3d 75, 78 (1st Cir.2001). Despite the deference that is due, we are of the view that the court below went too far when it banned Pi&#241;ot from testifying <i>at all</i> on the ground that his testimony would embody inadmissible legal opinion. Our reasoning follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts generally have held legal opinion testimony inadmissible under Fed.R.Evid. 702. <i>See, e.g., Specht v. Jensen,</i> 853 F.2d 805, 807-10 (10th Cir.1988) (en banc); <i>Marx &amp; Co. v. Diners' Club, Inc.,</i> 550 F.2d 505, 508-11 (2d Cir.1977). But these cases are inapposite here. As we already have explained, the defendants proposed to call Pi&#241;ot as a fact witness, not an expert witness under Rule 702. <i>See supra</i> Part II(B)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that Pi&#241;ot was a percipient witness makes a world of difference. Assuming for the sake of argument that <i>Nieves-Villanueva</i> announced a general evidentiary rule to the effect that legal opinion testimony is per se inadmissible,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> that rule would not be implicated in these circumstances. After all, the rationale for excluding legal opinions is directed at excluding testimony as to ultimate legal conclusions. Thus, courts have held that a witness cannot testify that an appointment was made in violation of the law, <i>e.g., Nieves-Villanueva,</i> 133 F.3d at 99, or that a search was unreasonable and thus illegal, <i>e.g., Specht,</i> 853 F.2d at 808, or that contractual obligations have a particular legal effect, <i>e.g., Marx &amp; Co.,</i> 550 F.2d at 508. But courts \"draw a clear line between permissible testimony on issues of fact and testimony that articulates the ultimate principles of law governing the deliberations of the jury.\" <i>Specht,</i> 853 F.2d at 808.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pi&#241;ot's proposed testimony clearly falls on the sunny side of this line. While his testimony was not admissible for the purpose of proving what obligations the law imposed upon the Mayor, it was admissible to show the Mayor's understanding at the time and his ensuing state of mind. <i>See United States v. Cavin,</i> 39 F.3d 1299, 1309 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, Pi&#241;ot's testimony &#8212; like all testimony &#8212; would have been subject to the balancing test mandated by Evidence Rule 403 (which allows exclusion of relevant evidence \"if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of. . . confusion of the issues[] or misleading the jury\"). But the district court did not rely upon Rule 403 in excluding Pi&#241;ot's testimony, and, in all events, the wholesale exclusion of that testimony cannot be justified under Rule 403. The Rule 403 balancing test applies statement by statement. <i>See Kassel v. Gannett Co.,</i> 875 F.2d 935, 952 (1st Cir.1989) (noting that the trial court \"must balance the prejudicial effect and probative value of each statement offered\"). To use the rule as an instrument for the wholesale exclusion of a percipient witness's testimony would be tantamount to allowing the presider to cut down the entire tree out of fear that some of the fruit might prove rotten. Rule 403 requires more delicate pruning of evidentiary proffers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> <i>See id.</i> (warning against throwing \"out the baby with the bath water\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this aspect of the matter. Although Pi&#241;ot may well have testified as to the legal advice that he gave the Mayor, that is not the kind of legal opinion testimony that the case law deems wholly inadmissible. Accordingly, the blanket exclusion of Pi&#241;ot's testimony constituted an abuse of the trial court's discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>The Mayor's Wife.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants also assert that the trial court erred in allowing Morales's testimony as to the substance of discussions she claims to have had with the Mayor's wife (Pinero). Morales testified over objection that Pinero interviewed her in an office in the town hall; that Pinero queried Morales's escort as to whether she (Morales) was a member of the PDP; and that, after receiving an assurance of Morales's political fealty, Pinero expressed an interest in hiring Morales as her secretary. She then asked for Morales's full name, stated that \"Law 52 was going to be approved,\" and indicated that this created an opportunity for the new administration to hire PDP adherents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs offered this testimony to prove the truth of the matter asserted, i.e., that the defendants acted out of a politically discriminatory animus in allowing the plaintiffs' Law 52 contracts to expire and in filling the new jobs with PDP partisans. Because Pinero was not a party to the case, the testimony, on its face, was garden-variety hearsay. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 801(c) (\"`Hearsay' is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\"). As such, it was inadmissible unless it somehow escaped the normal hearsay prohibition. To avoid this bar, the plaintiffs posited that Pinero's statements were not hearsay because they constituted admissions of a party-opponent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> The defendants objected, pointing to the lack of an adequate foundation. To counter this objection, the plaintiffs insisted that Pinero was a member of the Mayor's inner circle (and, therefore, an agent of the defendants).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court overruled the defendants' objections, reasoning that \"Mayor Rivera's wife was in fact an extension of the Mayor, and did in fact hold a position within the Municipality of Gurabo that was akin to his alter ego.\" The jury was then allowed to hear Morales's version of the conversation. The district court reiterated its earlier conclusion in the course of denying the defendants' post-trial motions, recalling that it had heard \"repeated testimony that [Pinero] occupied an office at the Municipality\" and that she \"was conducting interviews of prospective employees on behalf of the Mayor.\" <i>G&#243;mez II,</i> 281 F.Supp.2d at 88. The court then stated that it was \"common knowledge that wives of politicians often occupy positions of power and prestige within the government alongside their husbands.\" <i>Id.</i> We examine this ruling for abuse of discretion. <i>See Pendleton,</i> 156 F.3d at 64.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Parties wishing to introduce statements into evidence under the aegis of Rule 801(d)(2)(D) must establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, (1) that an agency relationship existed; (2) that the statements were made during the course of the relationship; and (3) that the statements relate to matters within the scope of the agency. <i>Larch v. Mansfield Mun. Elec. Dep't,</i> 272 F.3d 63, 72 (1st Cir.2001). Although the Evidence Rules do not define \"agent\" or \"servant,\" federal courts grappling with Rule 801(d)(2)(D) proffers have adopted and applied the traditional meanings of those terms as reflected in the federal common law of agency. <i>See, e.g., City of Tuscaloosa v. Harcros Chems., Inc.,</i> 158 F.3d 548, 557 n. 9 (11th Cir.1998); <i>Lippay v. Christos,</i> 996 F.2d 1490, 1497 (3d Cir.1993).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is hornbook law that an agency cannot be proven solely by the unsupported out-of-court statements of the claimed agent. Although the contents of the putative agent's out-of-court statements may be considered in the decisional calculus, the statements \"are not alone sufficient to establish the declarant's authority.\" Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2). For present purposes, then, Morales's testimony cannot be viewed as self-authenticating. An agency relationship must be shown to exist by independent evidence before out-of-court statements by a purported agent can be deemed admissions by a party-opponent. <i>Mackey v. Burke,</i> 751 F.2d 322, 326 n. 3 (10th Cir.1984); <i>United States v. Portsmouth Paving Corp.,</i> 694 F.2d 312, 321 (4th Cir.1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faced with the need to identify independent foundational facts, the plaintiffs point out that the determination of whether a party has built a proper foundation is left principally to the sound discretion of the presider. <i>See United States v. Saccoccia,</i> 58 F.3d 754, 782 (1st Cir.1995). Although we accept that truism, the trial court's discretion is not boundless. <i>See Ruiz-Troche v. Pepsi Cola of P.R. Bottling Co.,</i> 161 F.3d 77, 83 (1st Cir.1998). At a bare minimum, the requisite foundation demands something more than intuitive judgments emanating from broad generalities. <i>See Kissinger v. Lofgren,</i> 836 F.2d 678, 683 (1st Cir.1988) (stating that a proper foundation requires the proponent to adduce \"`evidence sufficient to support a finding' that the evidence is what the proponent claims it to be\") (quoting 5 J. Weinstein &amp; M. Berger, Weinstein's Evidence, &#182; 901(a)); <i>see also</i> Fed.R.Evid. 104(b). Here, there is no \"more.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have combed the record in this case and discovered no independent evidence sufficient to establish the requisite foundation. To be sure, the district court said that Pinero was conducting interviews of prospective employees on the Mayor's behalf. Apart from Morales's testimony, however, there is nothing to show that Pinero interviewed Morales (or any other prospective employee, for that matter) on behalf of the Mayor. By like token, the court suggested that it \"ha[d] to allow [the] testimony\" because, \"as the wife of the new Mayor,\" Pinero \"was in charge of the political operations of the Municipality of Gurabo at the time.\" This too is an uncorroborated ipse dixit; there is simply no proof that the Municipality, as a governmental entity, engaged in \"political operations\" under the hegemony of the Mayor's wife either in this administration or as a matter of custom and practice. Nor is the fact that Pinero had a town hall office at her disposal sufficient to furnish the missing foundational support. In the ordinary course of events, many persons are assigned offices at the seat of government &#8212; but that placement does not confer wide-ranging authority upon all of them. To the extent that Pinero had political duties or responsibilities, the record does not contain any enumeration of them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, Pinero's marriage to the Mayor, without more, does not demonstrate the formation of an agency relationship between them. The mere existence of a marital bond cannot serve as a proxy for competent proof of an agency relationship. <i>Cf. Gannett v. Carp (In re Carp),</i> 340 F.3d 15, 26 (1st Cir.2003) (noting that \"[t]he sins of the husband are not automatically visited upon the wife\"). While we are not blind to political realities &#8212; we recognize that spouses of elected officials can, and often do, exercise influence in matters of public concern &#8212; generalizations are no substitute for hard facts. <i>See Blake v. Pellegrino,</i> 329 F.3d 43, 48 (1st Cir.2003). In this case, the absence of particularized evidence dooms the plaintiffs' argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In making this assessment, we find unhelpful the district court's statement that Pinero \"was part of the political group that had taken over the new administration.\" For aught that appears, that statement is based only on Pinero's PDP ties and her support for her husband's candidacy. If this were sufficient to make Pinero an agent of either the Mayor or the Municipality, then any member of the PDP would so qualify. That is not the law. <i>See</i> Restatement (Second) of Agency &#167; 1 (1958) (defining agency).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to locate the missing link, the plaintiffs note that the Mayor testified during his deposition that his wife regularly collects information for him. That comment, offered in response to a question asking \"in what way does your wife help you in . . . municipal affairs?,\" fails to prove the plaintiffs' point. When the interrogator inquired further, the Mayor made it clear that his wife's role was social in nature and that she played no part in the making of employment decisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more on this point would be supererogatory. Because the record reveals no evidence sufficient to sustain a finding that Pinero acted as an agent for either the Mayor or the Municipality in connection with the hiring of Law 52 employees, the district court abused its discretion in failing to exclude Morales's testimony as hearsay. <i>See, e.g., Am. Eagle Ins. Co. v. Thompson,</i> 85 F.3d 327, 333 (8th Cir.1996); <i>Lippay,</i> 996 F.2d at 1496-99.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">D. <i>Effect of the Errors.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to the cumulative effect of these errors. The analytic framework is familiar: a district court's error necessitates a new trial only if it affects the complaining party's substantial rights. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 61. In general &#8212; the exceptions are not applicable here &#8212; this standard requires that the challenged ruling has had a substantial and injurious effect or influence upon the jury's verdict. <i>Ruiz-Troche,</i> 161 F.3d at 87. To make this determination, a reviewing court must scrutinize the record as a whole and aggregate the collective effects of multiple errors. <i>See United States v. Sepulveda,</i> 15 F.3d 1161, 1195-96 (1st Cir.1993). If the verdict is to stand, the court must be able to say with a fair degree of assurance that the error(s) did not skew the verdict. <i>Ruiz-Troche,</i> 161 F.3d at 87.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have thus far identified three errors, but the first of these is anchored in quicksand. The district court's erroneous \"property interest\" ruling first manifested itself in its denial of summary judgment. <i>G&#243;mez I,</i> 218 F.Supp.2d at 78-79. That order is unappealable at this juncture. The law is clear that, after trial, the denial of summary judgment merges into the verdict and cannot be assigned as error. <i>See Rivera-Torres v. Ortiz-Velez,</i> 341 F.3d 86, 91 (1st Cir.2003); <i>Iacobucci v. Boulter,</i> 193 F.3d 14, 22 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The erroneous \"property interest\" ruling also cropped up in the district court's jury instructions. An incorrect jury instruction is, of course, appealable. Here, however, the defendants did not interpose a contemporaneous objection to the faulty instruction. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 51. Consequently, they did not preserve their claim of error. We have held fast to the proposition that \"silence after instructions. . . typically constitutes a waiver of any objections.\" <i>Wilson v. Maritime Overseas Corp.,</i> 150 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.1998) (citing <i>Putnam Resources v. Pateman,</i> 958 F.2d 448, 456 (1st Cir.1992)). That is precisely what transpired here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While a forfeited claim of error (such as a claim of instructional error unaccompanied by a contemporaneous objection) is almost always subject to plain error review, <i>Chestnut v. City of Lowell,</i> 305 F.3d 18, 20 (1st Cir.2002) (en banc) (per curiam), that is a rigorous standard to satisfy, <i>see United States v. Duarte,</i> 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.2001) (explaining that \"[r]eview for plain error entails four showings: (1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings\"). In a nutshell, the defendants would have to show not only that the instructional error was obvious but also that the injustice was great.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts ought not to decide difficult, highly nuanced issues unnecessarily. In this instance, prudence dictates that we refrain from opining whether the defective instruction sinks to the level of plain error. Because the record contains other cognizable errors that in and of themselves require a new trial, <i>see</i> text <i>infra,</i> we are content to allow our comments on the \"property interest\" ruling to stand as a guide to the district court on retrial. <i>See Rosaly v. Ignacio,</i> 593 F.2d 145, 147-48 (1st Cir.1979) (employing a similar strategy).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the two evidentiary bevues (both of which were properly preserved). In employment discrimination cases, the factors that motivate a decision are central to the decisionmaker's liability in his personal capacity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> <i>See Acevedo-Garcia v. Vera-Monroig,</i> 204 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir.2000) (stating that a political discrimination claim \"has no meaning absent the allegation of impermissible motivation\"); <i>see also G&#243;mez I,</i> 218 F.Supp.2d at 77 (recognizing that \"the information possessed by the defendant\" is an important variable in that equation) (quoting <i>Kelley v. LaForce,</i> 288 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.2002)). So viewed, the trial court's order barring Pi&#241;ot's testimony in its entirety went to the heart of the contested issue. That testimony was the linchpin of the Mayor's claim that his actions were objectively reasonable; it would have corroborated the Mayor's version of why he did what he did. Consequently, its exclusion was plainly prejudicial. <i>See Cavin,</i> 39 F.3d at 1309 (finding that the exclusion of expert testimony regarding the considerations that face an attorney whose client is using his services to perpetrate fraud was reversible error as it \"prevent[ed] the lawyer from effectively presenting his defense\"); <i>cf. Blake,</i> 329 F.3d at 49 (finding prejudicial error when the trial court withheld evidence from the jury on matters that were vital to the case).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, moreover, the nisi prius court compounded the harmful effect of this error by refusing to allow the Mayor to testify as to the particular advice that he received from Pi&#241;ot. When defense counsel pointedly protested that the aim of this line of questioning \"was to ask [the Mayor] what did he do and what his understanding, good or wrong,\" might be, the court responded that the Mayor could not \"say anything as to the law . . . [or why] he thought he was not violating any law.\" That ruling was erroneous, <i>see supra</i> Part II(B)(2), and accentuated the harm resulting from the wholesale exclusion of Pi&#241;ot's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fairness, the court did allow the Mayor to \"testify that after he prepared the proposal[,] he asked for advice of the Secretary of Labor and after the advice given, he implemented the proposal accordingly. . . . He can say that he followed the advice . . . without explaining. . . .\" Although this was a step in the right direction, we agree with the defendants that it was not in any sense a satisfactory surrogate for Pi&#241;ot's testimony. A reasonable juror could as easily draw from this skeletal framework the conclusion that the Mayor sought legal advice on how to slake his thirst for political revenge in a way that would survive a legal challenge. The disallowance of Pi&#241;ot's testimony prevented the Mayor from placing factual flesh on these bare bones.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court's error in allowing Morales's testimony was the final nail in the coffin. Without Pinero's statements, the plaintiffs' case was entirely circumstantial. With that evidence, the plaintiffs had the benefit of the proverbial \"smoking gun.\" While circumstantial evidence can be sufficient for burden-shifting purposes in a discrimination case, <i>see Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 123 S.Ct. 2148, 2154-55, 156 L.Ed.2d 84 (2003), the distinction between circumstantial evidence and direct evidence can still be extremely important in front of a jury. Among other things, direct evidence can play a pivotal role in shifting the factfinder's attention from the credibility of the employee's complaint to the credibility of the employer's affirmative defense. <i>See Tyler v. Bethlehem Steel Corp.,</i> 958 F.2d 1176, 1185 (2d Cir.1992). Given the likely impact of this rather powerful evidence, we cannot say with confidence that the jury would have reached the same verdict had it been excluded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To summarize succinctly, we hold that the court's wholesale exclusion of Pi&#241;ot's testimony, coupled with the admission of Morales's hearsay testimony, constituted prejudicial error. Since there is an unacceptably high risk that these rulings in cumulation tipped the decisional scales, the verdict cannot stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">E. <i>The Stipulation.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we have found a new trial necessary, we still must address Rivera-Oyola's claim that she should not be part of that proceeding. She asserts that she is entitled to judgment because of Stipulated Fact No. 19 (the Stipulation), which states: \"While executing or implementing the Mayor's order to not renew the Plaintiffs' contracts, defendant Rivera-Oyola was strictly following orders. She had no participation in the act or official decision not to renew Plaintiffs' contracts.\" She questions whether, in light of this stipulation, she could be found to have been culpably involved in any constitutional violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court determined that the Stipulation conflicted with Stipulated Fact No. 22 (reciting that Rivera-Oyola \"drafted the Law 52 employees' termination letters\") and Stipulated Fact No. 23 (reciting that she and the Mayor \"discussed Plaintiffs' employment\"). Additionally, the court reasoned that Rivera-Oyola's position required her to share her views with the Mayor and collaborate with him in the formulation of policy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Accordingly, the court denied Rivera-Oyola's timely motions for summary judgment and judgment as a matter of law. Rivera-Oyola renewed the latter motion after trial, but the district court again denied it. <i>G&#243;mez II,</i> 278 F.Supp.2d at 86.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the court erroneously found a conflict where none existed and thus declined to enter judgment as a matter of law, we reverse and order the claims against Rivera-Oyola in her individual capacity dismissed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stipulations in litigation are favored because they tend to expedite trial proceedings, eliminate the need for proving essentially uncontested facts, and husband scarce judicial resources. <i>See T I Fed. Credit Union v. DelBonis,</i> 72 F.3d 921, 928 (1st Cir.1995). Determining the meaning and effect of a stipulation presents a question of law, engendering de novo review. <i>Braxton v. United States,</i> 500 U.S. 344, 350, 111 S.Ct. 1854, 114 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991). The question is not whether the stipulation can be read in a way that supports the decision of the trial court, but, rather, whether the trial court read the stipulation correctly. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stipulations are best \"understood as the analogue of terms binding parties to a contract.\" <i>T I Fed. Credit Union,</i> 72 F.3d at 928. Accordingly, the interpretation of a stipulation follows general contract law principles. <i>See id.</i> It is axiomatic that a contractual term should be construed in the context of the contract as a whole. <i>See Newport Plaza Assocs. v. Durfee Attleboro Bank</i> (<i>In re Newport Plaza Assocs.</i>), 985 F.2d 640, 646 (1st Cir.1993). Every term should be given effect, and, thus, separate clauses should be reconciled whenever possible. <i>See FDIC v. Singh,</i> 977 F.2d 18, 24 (1st Cir.1992); <i>see also Keystone Fabric Laminates, Inc. v. Fed. Ins. Co.,</i> 407 F.2d 1353, 1356 (3d Cir.1969).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera-Oyola asseverates that the Stipulation made it crystal clear that her role was purely ministerial (and, thus, non-culpable). The district court rejected this asseveration, concluding that the Stipulation conflicted with other stipulated facts and, therefore, left a jury question. But a fair reading of the Stipulation reveals no conflict at all. A person (say, a secretary) can draft a dismissal letter and discuss the terminated employment with her boss without in any way participating in the decision to discharge the affected employee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statutory job description relied on by the district court, <i>see supra</i> note 11, in no way alters this analysis. As a matter of interpretation, specific terms typically trump general ones. <i>See Edmond v. United States,</i> 520 U.S. 651, 657, 117 S.Ct. 1573, 137 L.Ed.2d 917 (1997); <i>Paul Revere Variable Annuity Ins. Co. v. Kirschhofer,</i> 226 F.3d 15, 21 n. 8 (1st Cir.2000). Here, the parties crafted the Stipulation to capture what had occurred on a particular occasion. That certainly carries far more weight than does a general statutory description that applies to a myriad of situations and a host of government employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, the statutory description is not in conflict with the Stipulation. Rivera-Oyola may well formulate policy and provide advice in a large number of areas (including personnel matters). The Stipulation simply acknowledges that she took no part in a particular set of employment decisions. Counseled parties freely agreed upon this language, and we see no reason either to disturb or to distort the plain meaning of the language that they chose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs argue that the Stipulation should be discounted because there are facts in evidence that conflict with it. That argument lacks force. For one thing, the plaintiffs do not point to any specific piece of evidence that actually contradicts the Stipulation. For another thing, the very purpose of a stipulation is to dispense with the need for proof of the stipulated fact. <i>Burstein v. United States,</i> 232 F.2d 19, 23 (8th Cir.1956). Thus, no evidence tending to establish facts contrary to the facts stipulated can be considered. <i>See Gander v. Livoti,</i> 250 F.3d 606, 609 (8th Cir.2001). If the plaintiffs wished to show Rivera-Oyola's personal involvement in the decisionmaking process &#8212; a fact that would have conflicted directly with the Stipulation &#8212; they were obliged to seek relief from the Stipulation. <i>See Burstein,</i> 232 F.2d at 23. Absent such a request &#8212; and none was made in this case &#8212; the Stipulation is binding upon the parties and the court. <i>See FDIC v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine</i> <i>Ins. Co.,</i> 942 F.2d 1032, 1038 (6th Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are left only to determine the legal effect of the Stipulation. For the plaintiffs to show a deprivation of their constitutional rights &#8212; a finding necessary to recover under section 1983 &#8212; they had to prove that discrimination substantially motivated the defendant's adverse employment decisions. <i>Mt. Healthy,</i> 429 U.S. at 287, 97 S.Ct. 568. In a political discrimination case, this required proof that the actor (here, Rivera-Oyola) intended to discriminate. <i>Rivera-Torres,</i> 341 F.3d at 98; <i>Feliciano-Angulo v. Rivera-Cruz,</i> 858 F.2d 40, 45-46 (1st Cir.1988); <i>cf. Chavez v. Martinez,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 123 S.Ct. 1994, 2000, 155 L.Ed.2d 984 (2003) (\"In deciding whether an officer is entitled to qualified immunity, we must first determine whether the officer's alleged conduct violated a constitutional right.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For purposes of this case, then, Rivera-Oyola cannot be personally liable to the plaintiffs unless she had a hand in the decision not to renew their Law 52 contracts and/or honor their applications for the newly created positions. There is no evidence at all that she participated in the hiring process. Thus, the case against her hinges on her role in the termination of the existing Law 52 agreements. The Stipulation defines that role. Giving the words their natural meaning, the Stipulation makes manifest that Rivera-Oyola had no hand in the relevant decisionmaking. Consequently, there is no way that the plaintiffs can carry their burden of showing that she was motivated by a constitutionally impermissible animus (and, thus, that she is subject to section 1983 liability). For this reason, the district court should have granted her motion for judgment as a matter of law and dismissed the claims against her in her individual capacity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> This was an enormously difficult case, and the able trial judge was forced to wrestle with a seemingly endless series of complex decisions. In such cases, perfect judicial scorecards are rare. Here, the court's errors were of sufficient magnitude to undermine confidence in the jury's verdict. We have no principled choice, therefore, but to reverse the judgment and to direct that the case be retried. The exception, of course, is the action against Rivera-Oyola in her individual capacity, which ought to be dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Reversed and remanded with instructions.

Second, the district court seems to have grounded its denial of brevis disposition vis-&#224;-vis the five plaintiffs who did not seek renewal of their Law 52 contracts on its property interest holding.

The twenty-four plaintiffs, all former employees of the Municipality of Gurabo (the Municipality), are members of the New Progressive Party (NPP). They sued three defendants &#8212; the Municipality, its mayor, Jos&#233; A. Rivera Rodr&#237;guez (the Mayor), and its human resources director, Luz E. Rivera-Oyola &#8212; under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, alleging that a politically discriminatory animus accounted for their sudden unemployment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs convinced both a jury and the district court of the accuracy of this claim; the jury awarded them substantial compensatory and punitive damages (enumerated in an appendix to this opinion), and the court ordered their reinstatement. The defendants appeal, assigning error in a number of discrete respects. After a painstaking review of the voluminous record, we conclude that the combined effect of two errors requires a new trial. We also conclude that, as to Rivera-Oyola, the district court erred in failing to grant judgment as a matter of law. The tale follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.

We rehearse here only those details that help to frame the issues on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More than a quarter-century ago, the Puerto Rico legislature created \"a special fund, separate and distinct from all other moneys or funds of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\" 29 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 711c(a) (1995) (Law 52). This fund was to be</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">continually at the disposition of the Secretary [of the Treasury] solely and exclusively for activities coordinated by the Employment Service of the Department of Labor and Human Resources directed to: (1) Promoting employment opportunities with future possibilities as thus identified officially by the Department of Labor and Human Resources; (2) promoting jobs that are in demand in the present market; (3) and promoting the creation of high productivity employment opportunities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> &#167; 711c(b). In practice, Law 52 soon became a vehicle through which the Commonwealth subsidized locally managed programs to ameliorate unemployment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite this local emphasis, municipalities have no automatic entitlement to Law 52 grants. To obtain funding, a municipality must submit a proposal describing how it intends to use the money. Because such proposals must be approved by the Commonwealth's Department of Labor and Human Resources (DLHR) from year to year, jobs subsidized by Law 52 funds are transitory in nature, typically lasting for one year only.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to the 2000 general election, the plaintiffs held municipal positions that had been created and funded under Law 52. Most of them had been so employed, under serial one-year contracts, for periods ranging from two to seven years. The latest contracts were due to expire on December 31, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The general election in November of 2000 included a race for the mayor's office. Rivera Rodr&#237;guez stood for election as the candidate of the Popular Democratic Party (PDP). The plaintiffs openly opposed his candidacy, participating unabashedly in partisan marches, meetings, fundraisers, leaflet drops, and other political activities. Notwithstanding the plaintiffs' efforts, Rivera Rodr&#237;guez defeated the incumbent NPP mayor, Victor Rivera Acevedo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to the inauguration, the outgoing administration submitted an updated Law 52 proposal to DLHR. It also extended the plaintiffs' employment contracts through January 31, 2001. The changing of the guard took place on January 9, 2001, and the Mayor appointed Rivera-Oyola (a fellow PDP member) to the position of human resources director. Soon thereafter, the Municipality received word that DLHR would not approve the Law 52 proposal previously submitted by the lameduck administration.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In lieu thereof, DLHR requested a reworked proposal based on the needs perceived by the new administration. As of the expiration date of the plaintiffs' contracts, no further Law 52 funds had been made available to the Municipality. After discussing the lack of money with Rivera-Oyola, the Mayor, by letter dated January 30, 2001, notified the plaintiffs that their employment would cease the next day.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly thereafter, the Municipality submitted a revamped Law 52 proposal to DLHR. The agency approved that proposal on February 14, 2001. The job descriptions had changed and, prior to filling the newly sanctioned positions, the Mayor met with Luis Pi&#241;ot Arecco (Pi&#241;ot), DLHR's deputy secretary for legal affairs and norms. The ostensible purpose of the meeting was to discuss the ground rules for the hiring of Law 52 employees. When the Municipality eventually filled the new positions, the plaintiffs were left out in the cold.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dismayed by these developments, the plaintiffs filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. They alleged, inter alia, that the Mayor and Rivera-Oyola (who were sued in both their individual and representative capacities) had violated their freedoms of speech and association under the First Amendment in failing to renew their Law 52 employment contracts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The defendants denied that they had violated the plaintiffs' rights, asserting that the disputed employment decisions were the upshot of the new administration's differing policies as to how best to serve the needs of the community.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 22, 2002, the individual defendants moved for summary judgment. They asserted, inter alia, that the complaint should be dismissed as to five of the plaintiffs because they had not sought renewal of their contracts; that the complaint should be dismissed as to Rivera-Oyola because of the parties' stipulation that she had not participated in the decision to let the plaintiffs' contracts expire, <i>see supra</i> note 2; and that the complaint should be dismissed as to the Mayor on the ground of qualified immunity because, given the guidance he had received from DLHR, it was objectively reasonable for him to believe that his conduct did not offend clearly established law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected the defendants' motion as to the five plaintiffs who did not seek reappointment, finding that each of them had a constitutionally protected property interest in continued employment. In this regard, the court declared that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[W]hen there are funds available for renewal of Law 52 positions, transitory employees who have been continuously re-employed with previous Law 52 grants and who have been for all practical purposes refused re-employment, have at that point a property interest in their continued employment and therefore must be allowed and are entitled to a pre-termination hearing. Under these circumstances, if the contract of a Law 52 transitory employee is not renewed and another person who is affiliated with a rival political party is employed in his stead, the Law 52 transitory employees (Plaintiffs in this case) have a cause of action under the law not only for political discrimination but also for due process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>G&#243;mez I,</i> 218 F.Supp.2d at 79. The court also refused to dismiss the complaint as to Rivera-Oyola, concluding that the record contained facts that contradicted the stipulation and that her position inherently \"has more influence with decision-making matters than that of a general employee who merely follows orders.\" <i>Id.</i> at 75.

First, the court must determine whether the plaintiff is the kind of employee whose job enjoys protection against political patronage. <i>See Branti,</i> 445 U.S. at 517-20, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110232\"><a href=\"/opinion/110232/branti-v-finkel/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Basically, this protection extends to public employees who occupy neither policymaking positions nor positions of unusual confidence. <i>See Vazquez Rios v. Hernandez Colon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"488725\"><a href=\"/opinion/488725/aurea-e-vazquez-rios-v-rafael-hernandez-colon-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">819</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span>, 322-26 (1st Cir.1987). We need not probe this point more deeply as the plaintiffs in this case held low-level jobs and the defendants have not claimed that political affiliation was an appropriate criterion for making decisions vis-&#224;-vis those jobs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second question involves causation: whether a plaintiff was denied, or banished from, public employment for political reasons. This requires the plaintiff to show that political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor in the decisional calculus. <i>Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v.

The court originally made this holding in denying the defendants' motion for summary judgment, <i>G&#243;mez I,</i> 218 F.Supp.2d at 77-79, and later instructed the jury to the same effect. We deal first with this point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with an explanation of why it makes a difference whether a public employee has &#8212; or does not have &#8212; a property interest in her employment. An employer usually can dismiss an at-will employee without any special ceremony. <i>See Smith v. F.W. Morse &amp; Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196571\"><a href=\"/opinion/196571/smith-v-fw-morse-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">413</span></a></span>, 426 (1st Cir.1996) (explaining that \"an employer can give an at-will employee &#8212; even one who has been a stellar performer &#8212; her walking papers at any time, for any reason or no reason\"). A public employee may, however, acquire a property interest in continued employment. In that event, the employer cannot dismiss her (and, thus, deprive her of her property) without affording her due process.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111372\"><a href=\"/opinion/111372/cleveland-bd-of-ed-v-loudermill/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">532</span></a></span>, 538, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111372\"><a href=\"/opinion/111372/cleveland-bd-of-ed-v-loudermill/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

A constitutionally protected property interest in continued public employment typically arises when the employee has a reasonable expectation that her employment will continue. <i>See, e.g., Rivera-Muriente v. Agosto-Alicea,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"579946\"><a href=\"/opinion/579946/juan-rivera-muriente-v-juan-agosto-alicea/\"><span class=\"volume\">959</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">349</span></a></span>, 352 (1st Cir.1992). Under ordinary circumstances, an at-will employee lacks a reasonable expectation of continued employment (and, thus, has no property interest in her job). <i>King v. Town of Hanover,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"742622\"><a href=\"/opinion/742622/74-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1266-71-empl-prac-dec-p-44807-bruce-h/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">965</span></a></span>, 969 (1st Cir.1997). This is true of so-called transitory public employees in Puerto Rico. <i>See, e.g., Nieves-Villanueva v. Soto-Rivera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197702\"><a href=\"/opinion/197702/nieves-villanueva-v-soto-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">92</span></a></span>, 94 (1st Cir.1997) (explaining that \"transitory employees generally do not have a property interest in continued employment beyond their yearly terms of appointment\"); <i>Caro v.

In reaching this conclusion, the court recognized that \"a property interest is not <i>generally</i> granted to transitory employee positions because these positions are created to fill an employer need or to perform specific tasks of a finite duration.\" <i>G&#243;mez I,</i> 218 F.Supp.2d at 78 (emphasis in original). The court regarded positions subsidized under Law 52 as an exception to this rule because the \"transitory nature[]\" of such positions is \"predicated upon the approval of Law 52 proposals and the subsequent availability of funds and [is] not based merely on employer need.\" <i>Id.</i> at 78-79.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we agree with the district court's premise &#8212; Law 52 positions do depend to some extent on DLHR's approval of annual proposals and the concomitant release of funds &#8212; we cannot accept the court's conclusion that individual employees are entitled to property interests in the positions themselves. There is nothing in either the language or the legislative history of Law 52 that would except positions subsidized thereunder from the operation of the usual rule. The district court therefore erred in holding that the plaintiffs had property interests in their Law 52 employment beyond the stated duration of their annual contracts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Pi&#241;ot's Testimony.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next battleground that we visit concerns the district court's decision to bar the testimony of Pi&#241;ot (whom both sides had identified in the joint pretrial order as a fact witness to the events leading to the Mayor's actions). The court predicated its decision on two grounds: (1) that the defendants had failed to submit a written report detailing Pi&#241;ot's intended testimony or otherwise to satisfy the disclosure requirements imposed by Fed.R.Civ.P. 26, and (2) that Pi&#241;ot's testimony would inevitably encompass his interpretation of Law 52, thus encroaching on the judge's domain. <i>G&#243;mez II,</i> 218 F.Supp.2d at 87. We test these premises.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Fed.R.Civ.P. 26.</i> The trial court worried that the proffered testimony was, in the court's own words, \"in actuality that of an expert.\" Based on this conclusion, the court ruled that Pi&#241;ot could not testify because the defendants had neglected to comply with the expert witness requirements of Rule 26. So viewed, the preclusionary order was a sanction for a discovery violation, which we review for abuse of discretion. <i>Macaulay v. Anas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200359\"><a href=\"/opinion/200359/macaulay-v-anas/\"><span class=\"volume\">321</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 51 (1st Cir.2003); <i>Jackson v.

We approach this question mindful that a court abuses its discretion if it ignores a material factor deserving significant weight, relies upon an improper factor, or assesses only the proper mix of factors but makes a serious mistake in evaluating them. <i>Indep. Oil and Chem. Workers of Quincy, Inc. v. Procter &amp; Gamble Mfg. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"516410\"><a href=\"/opinion/516410/the-independent-oil-and-chemical-workers-of-quincy-inc-v-the-procter/\"><span class=\"volume\">864</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">927</span></a></span>, 929 (1st Cir.1988). Superimposed on that rubric is the principle that \"mistakes of law . . . always constitute abuses of a court's discretion.\" <i>Gay Officers Action League v. Puerto Rico,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199377\"><a href=\"/opinion/199377/ramos-padro-v-commonwealth-of-pr/\"><span class=\"volume\">247</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">288</span></a></span>, 292 (1st Cir.2001). For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the district court misclassified the proffered testimony and, accordingly, erred as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 26 is an integral part of the machinery devised to facilitate the management of pretrial discovery. Among other things, the rule places on litigants an affirmative duty to furnish, in advance of trial, \"the name . . . of each individual likely to have discoverable information that the disclosing party may use to support its claims or defenses . . . [and to] identif[y] the subjects of the information.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(1)(A). The record demonstrates that the instant defendants complied with this provision. In the joint pretrial order, they listed Pi&#241;ot as a potential witness, indicated his position with DLHR, and stated that he would \"testify regarding the meeting held with [the Mayor] over the discussion of the 2001 Law No. 52 proposal approval, the guidance requested by the [Mayor] regarding the former employees and the criteria provided for the mentioned issue.\" The statement left no doubt that Pi&#241;ot was a fact witness who possessed discoverable information. <i>See Cusumano v. Microsoft Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198247\"><a href=\"/opinion/198247/microsoft-corp-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">708</span></a></span>, 716 n. 5 (1st Cir.1998) (\"[T]o be discoverable, information need only appear to be `reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.'\") (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(1)). No more was exigible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true, of course, that Rule 26 delineates additional safeguards with respect to expert testimony. For instance, the rule obligates a party who wishes to offer such testimony to disclose, during pretrial proceedings, \"the identity of any person who may be used at trial to present evidence under Rules 702, 703 and 705 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(2)(A). Even more stringent requirements pertain to \"a witness who is retained or specially employed to provide expert testimony in the case or whose duties as an employee of the party regularly involve giving expert testimony.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(2)(B). Such a witness must submit a written report containing, inter alia, detailed information as to the qualifications and intended testimony of the witness. <i>Id.</i> The defendants regarded Pi&#241;ot as a fact witness, not an expert witness, and therefore omitted this information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court disagreed with this taxonomy. It ruled that the defendants had misclassified Pi&#241;ot and had thereby transgressed Rule 26. We find this ruling insupportable: the expert witness requirements do not affect a witness in Pi&#241;ot's position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 26 uses the term expert \"to refer to those persons who will testify under Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence with respect to scientific, technical, and other specialized matters.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(2) advisory committee's note to the 1993 amendments. That definition does not encompass a percipient witness who happens to be an expert. If the individual is not providing testimony under Rule 702, he is not an expert witness for the purpose of Rule 26. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The advisory committee specifically used the example of a treating physician to illustrate the sort of witness who may have specialized knowledge yet need not be considered an expert for the purpose of submitting a report as part of pretrial discovery. <i>See id.</i> By and large, courts have followed the advisory committee's lead and ruled that a treating physician, testifying as to his consultation with or treatment of a patient, is not an expert witness for purposes of Rule 26. <i>See, e.g., NGO v. Stand. Tools &amp; Equip. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">263</span></span>, 266 (D.Md.2000); <i>Mangla v.

United States,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></span>, 61 (S.D.Cal.1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The analogy is compelling. The record in this case makes manifest that Pi&#241;ot and the Mayor had met and discussed both the procedure for filling the new Law 52 slots and the Municipality's obligations to the former employees well before the occasion for litigation arose. The Mayor claims that he acted on Pi&#241;ot's advice. Unquestionably, then, Pi&#241;ot was a direct participant in the events at issue, and the record confirms that his testimony was offered to that end. Like the testimony of a treating physician, Pi&#241;ot's testimony would have been based on personal knowledge acquired before any litigation had begun. He was an actor with regard to the occurrences from which the tapestry of the lawsuit was woven, and the defendants sought to present his testimony on that basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bottom line is that Pi&#241;ot was a fact witness, and his first-hand testimony should have been considered under the standards that govern such witnesses &#8212; not under the special provisions that apply to expert witnesses. Consequently, the trial court's conclusion that there had been a discovery violation rested on a mistake of law. It follows inexorably that the court lacked authority to levy the preclusionary sanction &#8212; there was no transgression to punish.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let us be perfectly clear. Pi&#241;ot obviously has specialized knowledge by virtue of his position with DLHR and his chairmanship of the board that assesses and approves Law 52 proposals. But the triggering mechanism for application of Rule 26's expert witness requirements is not the status of the witness, but, rather, the essence of the proffered testimony. <i>Patel v. Gayes,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599064\"><a href=\"/opinion/599064/bhupendra-c-patel-also-known-as-ben-patel-and-meena-b-patel-his-wife/\"><span class=\"volume\">984</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">214</span></a></span>, 218 (7th Cir.1993); Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a) advisory committee's note to the 1993 amendments. Accordingly, a party need not identify a witness as an expert so long as the witness played a personal role in the unfolding of the events at issue and the anticipated questioning seeks only to elicit the witness's knowledge of those events. <i>See Patel,</i> 984 F.2d at 217-18. Pi&#241;ot fit into this niche. Thus, Rule 26 afforded no justification for the wholesale exclusion of his testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Legal Opinion.</i> Although we find the wholesale exclusion of Pi&#241;ot's lay testimony insupportable as a discovery sanction, the defendants have another obstacle to overcome. When granting the plaintiffs' motion in limine from the bench, the district court commented that \"any factual testimony that [Pi&#241;ot] may offer [would be] inextricably conjoined to expert opinion and testimony\"; that the witness would, in effect, wind up \"interpret[ing] the law for the jury\"; and that this concatenation of circumstances would infringe upon the judge's role as \"the sole interpreter of Law 52 when instructing the Jury on the law.\" The court reiterated this point in rebuffing the defendants' post-trial motions. <i>See G&#243;mez II,</i> 218 F.Supp.2d at 87 (declaring that \"no witness is allowed to interpret the law for the jury\"). In voicing these sentiments, the court leaned heavily on our decision in <i>Nieves-Villanueva,</i> 133 F.3d at 99 (describing as \"black-letter law\" the postulate that it is for the judge, not the witnesses, to inform the jurors as to the applicable law). We deem this an alternative basis for excluding Pi&#241;ot's testimony, and, thus, inquire into it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We evaluate a trial court's decision to admit or exclude evidence for abuse of discretion. <i>Pendleton v. City of Haverhill,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198106\"><a href=\"/opinion/198106/pendleton-v-haverhill/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span>, 64 (1st Cir.1998). This deferential standard applies because \"[e]very trial presents a blend of idiosyncratic circumstances\" &#8212; a reality that counsels in favor of affording the presider some appreciable latitude in making evidentiary findings. <i>United States v.

Despite the deference that is due, we are of the view that the court below went too far when it banned Pi&#241;ot from testifying <i>at all</i> on the ground that his testimony would embody inadmissible legal opinion. Our reasoning follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts generally have held legal opinion testimony inadmissible under Fed.R.Evid. 702. <i>See, e.g., Specht v. Jensen,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"509655\"><a href=\"/opinion/509655/o-george-specht-jr-and-june-b-specht-v-roger-jensen-doug-martin-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">853</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">805</span></a></span>, 807-10 (10th Cir.1988) (en banc); <i>Marx &amp; Co. v. Diners' Club, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"343353\"><a href=\"/opinion/343353/fed-sec-l-rep-p-95892-1-fed-r-evid-serv-661-marx-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">550</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">505</span></a></span>, 508-11 (2d Cir.1977). But these cases are inapposite here. As we already have explained, the defendants proposed to call Pi&#241;ot as a fact witness, not an expert witness under Rule 702. <i>See supra</i> Part II(B)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that Pi&#241;ot was a percipient witness makes a world of difference. Assuming for the sake of argument that <i>Nieves-Villanueva</i> announced a general evidentiary rule to the effect that legal opinion testimony is per se inadmissible,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> that rule would not be implicated in these circumstances. After all, the rationale for excluding legal opinions is directed at excluding testimony as to ultimate legal conclusions. Thus, courts have held that a witness cannot testify that an appointment was made in violation of the law, <i>e.g., Nieves-Villanueva,</i> 133 F.3d at 99, or that a search was unreasonable and thus illegal, <i>e.g., Specht,</i> 853 F.2d at 808, or that contractual obligations have a particular legal effect, <i>e.g., Marx &amp; Co.,</i> 550 F.2d at 508. But courts \"draw a clear line between permissible testimony on issues of fact and testimony that articulates the ultimate principles of law governing the deliberations of the jury.\" <i>Specht,</i> 853 F.2d at 808.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pi&#241;ot's proposed testimony clearly falls on the sunny side of this line. While his testimony was not admissible for the purpose of proving what obligations the law imposed upon the Mayor, it was admissible to show the Mayor's understanding at the time and his ensuing state of mind. <i>See United States v. Cavin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6797\"><a href=\"/opinion/6797/united-states-v-cavin/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1299</span></a></span>, 1309 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, Pi&#241;ot's testimony &#8212; like all testimony &#8212; would have been subject to the balancing test mandated by Evidence Rule 403 (which allows exclusion of relevant evidence \"if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of. . . confusion of the issues[] or misleading the jury\"). But the district court did not rely upon Rule 403 in excluding Pi&#241;ot's testimony, and, in all events, the wholesale exclusion of that testimony cannot be justified under Rule 403. The Rule 403 balancing test applies statement by statement. <i>See Kassel v. Gannett Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524049\"><a href=\"/opinion/524049/jeffrey-kassel-v-gannett-co-inc-dba-usa-today/\"><span class=\"volume\">875</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">935</span></a></span>, 952 (1st Cir.1989) (noting that the trial court \"must balance the prejudicial effect and probative value of each statement offered\"). To use the rule as an instrument for the wholesale exclusion of a percipient witness's testimony would be tantamount to allowing the presider to cut down the entire tree out of fear that some of the fruit might prove rotten. Rule 403 requires more delicate pruning of evidentiary proffers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> <i>See id.</i> (warning against throwing \"out the baby with the bath water\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this aspect of the matter. Although Pi&#241;ot may well have testified as to the legal advice that he gave the Mayor, that is not the kind of legal opinion testimony that the case law deems wholly inadmissible. Accordingly, the blanket exclusion of Pi&#241;ot's testimony constituted an abuse of the trial court's discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>The Mayor's Wife.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants also assert that the trial court erred in allowing Morales's testimony as to the substance of discussions she claims to have had with the Mayor's wife (Pinero). Morales testified over objection that Pinero interviewed her in an office in the town hall; that Pinero queried Morales's escort as to whether she (Morales) was a member of the PDP; and that, after receiving an assurance of Morales's political fealty, Pinero expressed an interest in hiring Morales as her secretary. She then asked for Morales's full name, stated that \"Law 52 was going to be approved,\" and indicated that this created an opportunity for the new administration to hire PDP adherents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs offered this testimony to prove the truth of the matter asserted, i.e., that the defendants acted out of a politically discriminatory animus in allowing the plaintiffs' Law 52 contracts to expire and in filling the new jobs with PDP partisans. Because Pinero was not a party to the case, the testimony, on its face, was garden-variety hearsay. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 801(c) (\"`Hearsay' is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\"). As such, it was inadmissible unless it somehow escaped the normal hearsay prohibition. To avoid this bar, the plaintiffs posited that Pinero's statements were not hearsay because they constituted admissions of a party-opponent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> The defendants objected, pointing to the lack of an adequate foundation. To counter this objection, the plaintiffs insisted that Pinero was a member of the Mayor's inner circle (and, therefore, an agent of the defendants).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court overruled the defendants' objections, reasoning that \"Mayor Rivera's wife was in fact an extension of the Mayor, and did in fact hold a position within the Municipality of Gurabo that was akin to his alter ego.\" The jury was then allowed to hear Morales's version of the conversation. The district court reiterated its earlier conclusion in the course of denying the defendants' post-trial motions, recalling that it had heard \"repeated testimony that [Pinero] occupied an office at the Municipality\" and that she \"was conducting interviews of prospective employees on behalf of the Mayor.\" <i>G&#243;mez II,</i> 281 F.Supp.2d at 88. The court then stated that it was \"common knowledge that wives of politicians often occupy positions of power and prestige within the government alongside their husbands.\" <i>Id.</i> We examine this ruling for abuse of discretion. <i>See Pendleton,</i> 156 F.3d at 64.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Parties wishing to introduce statements into evidence under the aegis of Rule 801(d)(2)(D) must establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, (1) that an agency relationship existed; (2) that the statements were made during the course of the relationship; and (3) that the statements relate to matters within the scope of the agency. <i>Larch v.

Although the Evidence Rules do not define \"agent\" or \"servant,\" federal courts grappling with Rule 801(d)(2)(D) proffers have adopted and applied the traditional meanings of those terms as reflected in the federal common law of agency. <i>See, e.g., City of Tuscaloosa v.

Although the contents of the putative agent's out-of-court statements may be considered in the decisional calculus, the statements \"are not alone sufficient to establish the declarant's authority.\" Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2). For present purposes, then, Morales's testimony cannot be viewed as self-authenticating. An agency relationship must be shown to exist by independent evidence before out-of-court statements by a purported agent can be deemed admissions by a party-opponent. <i>Mackey v.

Although we accept that truism, the trial court's discretion is not boundless. <i>See Ruiz-Troche v. Pepsi Cola of P.R. Bottling Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198219\"><a href=\"/opinion/198219/ruiz-troche-v-pepsi-cola/\"><span class=\"volume\">161</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">77</span></a></span>, 83 (1st Cir.1998). At a bare minimum, the requisite foundation demands something more than intuitive judgments emanating from broad generalities. <i>See Kissinger v.

Here, there is no \"more.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have combed the record in this case and discovered no independent evidence sufficient to establish the requisite foundation. To be sure, the district court said that Pinero was conducting interviews of prospective employees on the Mayor's behalf. Apart from Morales's testimony, however, there is nothing to show that Pinero interviewed Morales (or any other prospective employee, for that matter) on behalf of the Mayor. By like token, the court suggested that it \"ha[d] to allow [the] testimony\" because, \"as the wife of the new Mayor,\" Pinero \"was in charge of the political operations of the Municipality of Gurabo at the time.\" This too is an uncorroborated ipse dixit; there is simply no proof that the Municipality, as a governmental entity, engaged in \"political operations\" under the hegemony of the Mayor's wife either in this administration or as a matter of custom and practice. Nor is the fact that Pinero had a town hall office at her disposal sufficient to furnish the missing foundational support. In the ordinary course of events, many persons are assigned offices at the seat of government &#8212; but that placement does not confer wide-ranging authority upon all of them. To the extent that Pinero had political duties or responsibilities, the record does not contain any enumeration of them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, Pinero's marriage to the Mayor, without more, does not demonstrate the formation of an agency relationship between them. The mere existence of a marital bond cannot serve as a proxy for competent proof of an agency relationship. <i>Cf. Gannett v. Carp (In re Carp),</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200602\"><a href=\"/opinion/200602/gannett-v-carp/\"><span class=\"volume\">340</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir.2003) (noting that \"[t]he sins of the husband are not automatically visited upon the wife\"). While we are not blind to political realities &#8212; we recognize that spouses of elected officials can, and often do, exercise influence in matters of public concern &#8212; generalizations are no substitute for hard facts. <i>See Blake v. Pellegrino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200465\"><a href=\"/opinion/200465/blake-v-first-physicians-cor/\"><span class=\"volume\">329</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, 48 (1st Cir.2003). In this case, the absence of particularized evidence dooms the plaintiffs' argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In making this assessment, we find unhelpful the district court's statement that Pinero \"was part of the political group that had taken over the new administration.\" For aught that appears, that statement is based only on Pinero's PDP ties and her support for her husband's candidacy. If this were sufficient to make Pinero an agent of either the Mayor or the Municipality, then any member of the PDP would so qualify. That is not the law. <i>See</i> Restatement (Second) of Agency &#167; 1 (1958) (defining agency).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to locate the missing link, the plaintiffs note that the Mayor testified during his deposition that his wife regularly collects information for him. That comment, offered in response to a question asking \"in what way does your wife help you in . . . municipal affairs?,\" fails to prove the plaintiffs' point. When the interrogator inquired further, the Mayor made it clear that his wife's role was social in nature and that she played no part in the making of employment decisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more on this point would be supererogatory. Because the record reveals no evidence sufficient to sustain a finding that Pinero acted as an agent for either the Mayor or the Municipality in connection with the hiring of Law 52 employees, the district court abused its discretion in failing to exclude Morales's testimony as hearsay. <i>See, e.g., Am. Eagle Ins. Co. v.

The analytic framework is familiar: a district court's error necessitates a new trial only if it affects the complaining party's substantial rights. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 61. In general &#8212; the exceptions are not applicable here &#8212; this standard requires that the challenged ruling has had a substantial and injurious effect or influence upon the jury's verdict. <i>Ruiz-Troche,</i> 161 F.3d at 87. To make this determination, a reviewing court must scrutinize the record as a whole and aggregate the collective effects of multiple errors. <i>See United States v. Sepulveda,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"662432\"><a href=\"/opinion/662432/united-states-v-david-sepulveda-united-states-of-america-v-edgar/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1161</span></a></span>, 1195-96 (1st Cir.1993). If the verdict is to stand, the court must be able to say with a fair degree of assurance that the error(s) did not skew the verdict. <i>Ruiz-Troche,</i> 161 F.3d at 87.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have thus far identified three errors, but the first of these is anchored in quicksand. The district court's erroneous \"property interest\" ruling first manifested itself in its denial of summary judgment. <i>G&#243;mez I,</i> 218 F.Supp.2d at 78-79. That order is unappealable at this juncture. The law is clear that, after trial, the denial of summary judgment merges into the verdict and cannot be assigned as error. <i>See Rivera-Torres v.

Because the record contains other cognizable errors that in and of themselves require a new trial, <i>see</i> text <i>infra,</i> we are content to allow our comments on the \"property interest\" ruling to stand as a guide to the district court on retrial. <i>See Rosaly v.

So viewed, the trial court's order barring Pi&#241;ot's testimony in its entirety went to the heart of the contested issue. That testimony was the linchpin of the Mayor's claim that his actions were objectively reasonable; it would have corroborated the Mayor's version of why he did what he did. Consequently, its exclusion was plainly prejudicial. <i>See Cavin,</i> 39 F.3d at 1309 (finding that the exclusion of expert testimony regarding the considerations that face an attorney whose client is using his services to perpetrate fraud was reversible error as it \"prevent[ed] the lawyer from effectively presenting his defense\"); <i>cf. Blake,</i> 329 F.3d at 49 (finding prejudicial error when the trial court withheld evidence from the jury on matters that were vital to the case).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, moreover, the nisi prius court compounded the harmful effect of this error by refusing to allow the Mayor to testify as to the particular advice that he received from Pi&#241;ot. When defense counsel pointedly protested that the aim of this line of questioning \"was to ask [the Mayor] what did he do and what his understanding, good or wrong,\" might be, the court responded that the Mayor could not \"say anything as to the law . . . [or why] he thought he was not violating any law.\" That ruling was erroneous, <i>see supra</i> Part II(B)(2), and accentuated the harm resulting from the wholesale exclusion of Pi&#241;ot's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fairness, the court did allow the Mayor to \"testify that after he prepared the proposal[,] he asked for advice of the Secretary of Labor and after the advice given, he implemented the proposal accordingly. . . . He can say that he followed the advice . . . without explaining. . . .\" Although this was a step in the right direction, we agree with the defendants that it was not in any sense a satisfactory surrogate for Pi&#241;ot's testimony. A reasonable juror could as easily draw from this skeletal framework the conclusion that the Mayor sought legal advice on how to slake his thirst for political revenge in a way that would survive a legal challenge. The disallowance of Pi&#241;ot's testimony prevented the Mayor from placing factual flesh on these bare bones.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court's error in allowing Morales's testimony was the final nail in the coffin. Without Pinero's statements, the plaintiffs' case was entirely circumstantial. With that evidence, the plaintiffs had the benefit of the proverbial \"smoking gun.\" While circumstantial evidence can be sufficient for burden-shifting purposes in a discrimination case, <i>see Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130146\"><a href=\"/opinion/130146/desert-palace-inc-v-costa/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">84</span></a></span> (2003), the distinction between circumstantial evidence and direct evidence can still be extremely important in front of a jury. Among other things, direct evidence can play a pivotal role in shifting the factfinder's attention from the credibility of the employee's complaint to the credibility of the employer's affirmative defense. <i>See Tyler v. Bethlehem Steel Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"579444\"><a href=\"/opinion/579444/59-fair-emplpraccas-bna-875-58-empl-prac-dec-p-41361-alvin-joel/\"><span class=\"volume\">958</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1176</span></a></span>, 1185 (2d Cir.1992). Given the likely impact of this rather powerful evidence, we cannot say with confidence that the jury would have reached the same verdict had it been excluded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To summarize succinctly, we hold that the court's wholesale exclusion of Pi&#241;ot's testimony, coupled with the admission of Morales's hearsay testimony, constituted prejudicial error. Since there is an unacceptably high risk that these rulings in cumulation tipped the decisional scales, the verdict cannot stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">E. <i>The Stipulation.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we have found a new trial necessary, we still must address Rivera-Oyola's claim that she should not be part of that proceeding. She asserts that she is entitled to judgment because of Stipulated Fact No. 19 (the Stipulation), which states: \"While executing or implementing the Mayor's order to not renew the Plaintiffs' contracts, defendant Rivera-Oyola was strictly following orders. She had no participation in the act or official decision not to renew Plaintiffs' contracts.\" She questions whether, in light of this stipulation, she could be found to have been culpably involved in any constitutional violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court determined that the Stipulation conflicted with Stipulated Fact No. 22 (reciting that Rivera-Oyola \"drafted the Law 52 employees' termination letters\") and Stipulated Fact No. 23 (reciting that she and the Mayor \"discussed Plaintiffs' employment\"). Additionally, the court reasoned that Rivera-Oyola's position required her to share her views with the Mayor and collaborate with him in the formulation of policy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Accordingly, the court denied Rivera-Oyola's timely motions for summary judgment and judgment as a matter of law. Rivera-Oyola renewed the latter motion after trial, but the district court again denied it. <i>G&#243;mez II,</i> 278 F.Supp.2d at 86.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the court erroneously found a conflict where none existed and thus declined to enter judgment as a matter of law, we reverse and order the claims against Rivera-Oyola in her individual capacity dismissed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stipulations in litigation are favored because they tend to expedite trial proceedings, eliminate the need for proving essentially uncontested facts, and husband scarce judicial resources. <i>See T I Fed.

The district court rejected this asseveration, concluding that the Stipulation conflicted with other stipulated facts and, therefore, left a jury question. But a fair reading of the Stipulation reveals no conflict at all. A person (say, a secretary) can draft a dismissal letter and discuss the terminated employment with her boss without in any way participating in the decision to discharge the affected employee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statutory job description relied on by the district court, <i>see supra</i> note 11, in no way alters this analysis. As a matter of interpretation, specific terms typically trump general ones. <i>See Edmond v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118113\"><a href=\"/opinion/118113/edmond-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">651</span></a></span>, 657, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118113\"><a href=\"/opinion/118113/edmond-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Here, the parties crafted the Stipulation to capture what had occurred on a particular occasion. That certainly carries far more weight than does a general statutory description that applies to a myriad of situations and a host of government employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, the statutory description is not in conflict with the Stipulation. Rivera-Oyola may well formulate policy and provide advice in a large number of areas (including personnel matters). The Stipulation simply acknowledges that she took no part in a particular set of employment decisions. Counseled parties freely agreed upon this language, and we see no reason either to disturb or to distort the plain meaning of the language that they chose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs argue that the Stipulation should be discounted because there are facts in evidence that conflict with it. That argument lacks force. For one thing, the plaintiffs do not point to any specific piece of evidence that actually contradicts the Stipulation. For another thing, the very purpose of a stipulation is to dispense with the need for proof of the stipulated fact. <i>Burstein v.

If the plaintiffs wished to show Rivera-Oyola's personal involvement in the decisionmaking process &#8212; a fact that would have conflicted directly with the Stipulation &#8212; they were obliged to seek relief from the Stipulation. <i>See Burstein,</i> 232 F.2d at 23. Absent such a request &#8212; and none was made in this case &#8212; the Stipulation is binding upon the parties and the court. <i>See FDIC v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine</i> <i>Ins.

For the plaintiffs to show a deprivation of their constitutional rights &#8212; a finding necessary to recover under section 1983 &#8212; they had to prove that discrimination substantially motivated the defendant's adverse employment decisions. <i>Mt.

There is no evidence at all that she participated in the hiring process. Thus, the case against her hinges on her role in the termination of the existing Law 52 agreements. The Stipulation defines that role. Giving the words their natural meaning, the Stipulation makes manifest that Rivera-Oyola had no hand in the relevant decisionmaking. Consequently, there is no way that the plaintiffs can carry their burden of showing that she was motivated by a constitutionally impermissible animus (and, thus, that she is subject to section 1983 liability). For this reason, the district court should have granted her motion for judgment as a matter of law and dismissed the claims against her in her individual capacity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.

We nonetheless treat this issue for two reasons. First, the case will have to be retried,<i>see</i> text <i>infra,</i> thus wiping the slate clean. Second, the district court seems to have grounded its denial of brevis disposition vis-&#224;-vis the five plaintiffs who did not seek renewal of their Law 52 contracts on its property interest holding. Because that rationale is insupportable, the status of these five plaintiffs will have to be reexamined by the district court.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> This determination in no way alters the First Amendment analysis.
