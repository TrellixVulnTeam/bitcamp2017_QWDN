Yolex Pierre is a citizen of Haiti who\n\nentered the United States without inspection through St. Thomas,\n\nVirgin Islands, around July 5, 2004.              On July 19, 2004, Pierre\n\nfiled for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the\n\nUnited Nations Convention Against Torture (“CAT”), alleging that\n\nhis life was in jeopardy because of his father's membership in the\n\nLavalas party, a political group formed by former Haitian President\n\nJean-Bertrand Aristide.          In November 2004, the Department of\n\nHomeland Security rejected Pierre's application for asylum and\n\ndenied any other relief.1\n\n              An immigration judge (“IJ”) held a hearing on July 13,\n\n2006,    at   which   Pierre   testified   that    in   February   2004,   when\n\nAristide was ousted illegally by the principal opposing party,\n\nmembers of that party then sought out Lavalas members and their\n\nfamilies, that in the same month his father had been kidnapped by\n\nbandits, the bandits had been masked but that (in Pierre's view)\n\nthey came from the opposing party, that his father had never been\n\nseen again and was thought to be dead, and that Pierre himself hid\n\nin fear and eventually fled to the United States.\n\n              Despite some discrepancies, the IJ credited Pierre's\n\nfactual testimony but noted that he had no evidence that the\n\nkidnappers were from the opposing party or that the kidnapping was\n\n\n     1\n      The requirements for withholding of removal and for relief\nunder CAT are, in general, more demanding than for asylum.\nPierre's brief focuses on the asylum claim and so do we.\n\n                                     -2-\n\fpolitically motivated, that Pierre himself was not politically\n\ninvolved and had never been personally threatened or attacked, and\n\nthat Pierre's siblings had remained in Haiti without incident. The\n\nIJ denied relief, finding that Pierre had not shown an objectively\n\nreasonable fear of persecution on account of one of the statutorily\n\nlisted bases.2\n\n           The Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") affirmed, and\n\nPierre now petitions for review by this court.        Pierre's central\n\nclaim on judicial review is that an objective basis for fear was\n\nestablished, and wrongly ignored by the IJ and BIA, based on State\n\nDepartment country reports that anti-Aristide forces are targeting\n\nLavalas   party   members   and   their   families.    Our   review   is\n\ndeferential: the    denial must \"must be upheld if 'supported by\n\nreasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record\n\nconsidered as a whole.'\" INS v.

His father was an active\n\nmember of the party but is not claimed to have been a major figure.\n\nPierre's brother and sister reside in Haiti unharmed.\n\n          The State Department report reprinted in Pierre's brief\n\nindicates that political violence did ensue after Aristide's ouster\n\nand included kidnappings, both political and for ransom, but there\n\nis no indication in the report that families of Aristide supporters\n\nwere or are systematically targeted.    So even if Pierre's fear is\n\nsubjectively genuine, the report does not furnish a solid objective\n\nbasis for this fear and the IJ was entitled to disregard it.\n\n          The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                               -4-\n\f",
