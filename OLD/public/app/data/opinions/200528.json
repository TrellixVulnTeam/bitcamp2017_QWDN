Having become convinced that\n\nSpalding Sports Worldwide, Inc. (Spalding) had terminated his\n\nemployment without proper cause,1 plaintiff-appellant Martin J.\n\nMulvihill   asked      his   union    —   Local     1851    of    the   International\n\nBrotherhood      of   Boilermakers,       Iron     Ship    Builders,      Blacksmiths,\n\nForgers and Helpers (the Union) — to prosecute a grievance against\n\nSpalding pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement then in\n\neffect (the CBA).         The Union did so.          But when Spalding rejected\n\nthe    grievance,      the    Union      refused    to     bring    the    matter   to\n\narbitration.\n\n            Mulvihill subsequently brought suit in the United States\n\nDistrict Court for the District of Massachusetts against Spalding\n\nand the Union.        In due course, the district court granted summary\n\njudgment    in    favor      of   both    defendants.            Mulvihill    appeals.\n\nConcluding, as we do, that Spalding acted with proper cause, we\n\naffirm the judgment below.\n\nI.    BACKGROUND\n\n            We present the facts derived from the record in the light\n\nmost favorable to the party opposing summary judgment (here, the\n\nplaintiff).      See Plumley v. S. Container, Inc., 303 F.3d 364, 367\n\n(1st Cir. 2002).\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      By virtue of certain corporate transactions not relevant\nhere, Spalding is now known as The Top-Flite Golf Company.\n\n                                          -2-\n\f             Mulvihill began his tour of duty at Spalding in 1969. At\n\nthe times material hereto, a CBA was in effect between Spalding and\n\nthe Union.     The CBA included a management rights provision, which\n\nstated, inter alia, that Spalding would \"continue to direct working\n\nforces, including the right to . . . discharge [employees] for\n\nproper cause.\"      The CBA also mapped out a standard grievance\n\nmechanism.    Under it, an offended employee could lodge a grievance\n\nwith a Union-organized committee and expect the grievance committee\n\nto press Spalding to resolve the complaint.      If that failed, the\n\nUnion had the right to compel Spalding to proceed to binding\n\narbitration.\n\n             Mulvihill, a long-time Union member, held a job within\n\nthe bargaining unit. In 2000, a coworker, Amy Charest, accused him\n\nof sexual harassment.       Acting on Charest's formal complaint,\n\nSpalding conducted an investigation. The results of that probe led\n\nit to terminate Mulvihill's employment.     Contending that Spalding\n\nhad discharged him without proper cause, Mulvihill submitted a\n\ngrievance.\n\n             Buoyed by Mulvihill's thirty-two years of service, the\n\nUnion's grievance committee lobbied Spalding to reconsider its\n\ndecision, reinstate Mulvihill, and award him back pay.      The main\n\nthrust of the Union's argument was that discharge was \"too serious\"\n\na remedy for the asserted misconduct.         Spalding rejected the\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fUnion's importunings, pointing to Charest's complaint and the\n\nresults of its investigation.\n\n            In her complaint, Charest had accused Mulvihill of:\n\nspreading \"false rumors\" within the company to the effect that she\n\nwas \"having an affair\" with a fellow employee named Mike Rattell;\n\ntelling Rattell's wife — who also worked for Spalding — about the\n\nalleged affair; \"interfering with [Charest's] personal life\" and\n\nmaking her feel \"violated\"; and creating a situation in which\n\nCharest found it \"emotionally and physically . . . hard [to]\n\nconcentrat[e] on [her] work.\"       Spalding's investigation into these\n\nremonstrances    revealed   the     following      undisputed     facts.    On\n\nSeptember 7, 2000, Charest's husband, Todd, had gone to Mulvihill's\n\nhome on matters unrelated to this dispute.                 The two discussed\n\nCharest's   putative   involvement     in    a    sexual   relationship    with\n\nRattell and Mulvihill agreed to give Todd Charest's telephone\n\nnumber to Rattell's wife (Melissa) so that she could contact him\n\nregarding their spouses' suspected infidelity.                Mulvihill passed\n\nthe telephone number to Melissa Rattell at work the following day.\n\nHe proceeded to tell two other Spalding employees (Domenic Montessi\n\nand Ray Perreault) about the alleged affair. According to them, he\n\nsupplied graphic detail.\n\n            Spalding's sexual harassment policy prohibits \"sexual\n\ndiscrimination   or    harassment    which       undermines    the   employment\n\nrelationship by creating an intimidating, hostile, and offensive\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fwork    environment.\"       The    policy      specifically     defines    verbal\n\nharassment to include \"spreading rumors about a coworker's sex\n\nlife\"    and    forbids   any     such    conduct    that   may    \"unreasonably\n\ninterfere[] with an employee's work performance.\" The executive in\n\ncharge   of     the   investigation,     Robert     Bourdeau,     concluded   that\n\nMulvihill's behavior transgressed the policy and created a working\n\nenvironment      that   Charest    reasonably       found   offensive.        After\n\nconsulting with senior management, Bourdeau terminated Mulvihill's\n\nemployment.\n\n               As said, the Union initially processed a grievance on\n\nMulvihill's behalf.        When Spalding resisted, the Union accepted\n\nSpalding's response, ignored Mulvihill's protests, and allowed the\n\nmatter to die on the vine.          After the deadline for submitting the\n\ngrievance to arbitration had passed, Mulvihill filed suit against\n\nSpalding and the Union.         His complaint asserted, inter alia, that\n\n(1) Spalding had violated section 301 of the Labor Management\n\nRelations Act (LMRA), 29 U.S.C. § 185, by cashiering him without\n\nproper cause (in derogation of the CBA), and (2) the Union had\n\nfailed to heed its duty fairly to represent him with respect to\n\nSpalding's breach.\n\n               This sort of double-barreled suit is known as a hybrid\n\nsection 301 action. See, e.g., Arriaga-Zayas v. Int'l Ladies'\n\nGarment Workers' Union, 835 F.2d 11, 12 (1st Cir. 1987).                  While it\n\nis composed of two causes of action — one against the employer and\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fthe   other    against    the   union    —    the   claims   are   inextricably\n\nintertwined.     See DelCostello v. Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters, 462 U.S.\n\n151, 164-65 (1983).        This imbrication is underscored by the fact\n\nthat in order to prevail against either defendant, the employee\n\nmust establish that the employer breached the CBA.                 Id. at 165.\n\n              The district court determined, at the summary judgment\n\nstage, that Spalding had acted with proper cause in discharging\n\nMulvihill (and, therefore, had not breached the CBA).                   On this\n\nbasis, the court disposed of the section 301 claims. Mulvihill also\n\nhad asserted a defamation claim, and the court found that claim\n\nwanting as well.        This appeal ensued.\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n              We begin our analysis with a reiteration of the by-now-\n\nfamiliar summary judgment standard. We then provide an overview of\n\nthe interaction between hybrid section 301 actions and Title VII.\n\nFinally, we turn to the merits of Mulvihill's claims.\n\n                   A.    The Summary Judgment Standard.\n\n              The role of summary judgment is to look behind the facade\n\nerected by the pleadings and assay the parties' proof in order to\n\ndetermine whether a trial will serve any useful purpose.               Plumley,\n\n303 F.3d at 368.        Conventional summary judgment practice requires\n\nthe moving party to assert the absence of a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact and then support that assertion by affidavits,\n\nadmissions, or other materials of evidentiary quality. Quintero de\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fQuintero v. Aponte-Roque, 974 F.2d 226, 227-28 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\nOnce the movant has done its part, the burden shifts to the summary\n\njudgment target to demonstrate that a trialworthy issue exists.\n\nSuarez v. Pueblo Int'l, Inc., 229 F.3d 49, 53 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\nWhen all is said and done, summary judgment will lie only if the\n\n\"pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions\n\non file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is\n\nno genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party\n\nis entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"                Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56(c).\n\n             In conducting this tamisage, the district court must\n\nscrutinize the record in the light most flattering to the party\n\nopposing the motion, indulging all reasonable inferences in that\n\nparty's favor.       Morris v. Gov't Dev. Bank, 27 F.3d 746, 748 (1st\n\nCir. 1994).      This standard is notoriously liberal — but its\n\nliberality    does    not   relieve    the   nonmovant   of   the   burden   of\n\nproducing specific facts sufficient to deflect the swing of the\n\nsummary judgment scythe.         Id.     Moreover, the factual conflicts\n\nrelied upon by the nonmovant must be both genuine and material.\n\nSee Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).       For this purpose, \"genuine\" means that\n\nthe evidence is such that a reasonable factfinder could resolve the\n\npoint in favor of the nonmoving party, and \"material\" means that\n\nthe fact is one that might affect the outcome of the suit under the\n\napplicable law.      Morris, 27 F.3d at 748.\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\f            This same paradigm governs our de novo review of a\n\ndistrict court's summary judgment rulings.            Plumley, 303 F.3d at\n\n369.   There is, however, one important distinction.             The court of\n\nappeals \"is not restricted to the district court's reasoning but\n\ncan affirm a summary judgment on any independently sufficient\n\nground\" made manifest in the record.            Mesnick v. Gen. Elec. Co.,\n\n950 F.2d 816, 822 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n                        B.    The Governing Law.\n\n            Federal common law supplies the substantive rules for\n\nadjudicating interlocked claims against an employer and a trade\n\nunion for breach of a CBA.      See Crider v. Spectrulite Consortium,\n\nInc., 130 F.3d 1238, 1242 (7th Cir. 1997); see also Fant v. New\n\nEngl. Power Serv., 239 F.3d 8,14 (1st Cir. 2001) (\"In creating §\n\n301 of the LMRA, Congress intended that a comprehensive, unified,\n\nbody   of   federal   law    should    govern     actions   concerning    the\n\ninterpretation    and       enforcement     of      collective     bargaining\n\nagreements.\") (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n            In this case, the CBA allowed Spalding to take certain\n\npersonnel   actions   (including       dismissal)    for    \"proper   cause.\"\n\nSpalding concluded that it had such cause and fired Mulvihill. The\n\nUnion refrained from testing that conclusion through arbitration.\n\nIn run-of-the-mine actions, the finality provisions of the CBA\n\nwould operate to preclude judicial review of such a determination.\n\nSee Abernathy v. United States Postal Serv., 740 F.2d 612, 617 (8th\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fCir. 1984).       But   hybrid   section      301   cases   are   fundamentally\n\ndifferent.    Because a hybrid section 301 action, by definition,\n\ninvolves a claim of inadequate union representation, the employer's\n\ndetermination can be overcome if the claimant can show, inter alia,\n\nthat the adverse employment action contravened the CBA.                Hines v.\n\nAnchor Motor Freight, Inc., 424 U.S. 554, 567 (1976).              In this way,\n\nthe law opens a remedial avenue for an employee \"who has been\n\ninjured by both the employer's and the union's breach.\"                Bowen v.\n\nUnited States Postal Serv., 459 U.S. 212, 222 (1983).\n\n           Although this remedial avenue can lead to make-whole\n\nrelief,   there   is    no   guarantee   of    safe   passage.      Typically,\n\nclaimants attempting to make the requisite showing in hybrid\n\nsection 301 actions must carry a heavy burden. Such claimants \"are\n\nnot entitled to relitigate their discharge[s] merely because they\n\noffer newly discovered evidence that the charges against them were\n\nfalse and that they in fact were fired without [sufficient] cause.\"\n\nHines, 424 U.S. at 571. Rather, such a case may proceed only if,\n\nand to the extent that, the claimant can show that the checks and\n\nbalances built into the CBA's internal dispute resolution process\n\nhave failed to function.       See McCreedy v. Local Union No. 971, 809\n\nF.2d 1232, 1238 (6th Cir. 1987).           To reach this safe harbor, the\n\nclaimant must prove an erroneous discharge, a breach of duty on the\n\nunion's part, and a causal nexus between the two, that is, \"that\n\n[the] union's breach of its duty 'seriously undermine[d] the\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fintegrity of the [grievance] process.'\"   United Parcel Serv., Inc.\n\nv. Mitchell, 451 U.S. 56, 61 (1981) (quoting Hines, 424 U.S. at\n\n567).\n\n          Let us be perfectly clear.   Proof of the required nexus\n\ndoes not entail a \"but for\" causal connection between the union's\n\nbreach of duty and the erroneous discharge.    Webb v. ABF Freight\n\nSys., Inc., 155 F.3d 1230, 1242 (10th Cir. 1998).         It does,\n\nhowever, require the claimant to produce sufficient evidence from\n\nwhich a reasonable factfinder can conclude not only that the\n\ndischarge was improper but also that the union's breach undermined\n\nthe grievance process and thereby contributed to the error.    See\n\nThomas v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 890 F.2d 909, 915 (7th Cir.\n\n1989); Apperson v. Fleet Carrier Corp., 879 F.2d 1344, 1355 (6th\n\nCir. 1989); see also Sear v. Cadillac Auto. Co. of Boston, 654 F.2d\n\n4, 7 (1st Cir. 1981) (Breyer, J.) (noting that \"[t]he burden . . .\n\nupon a union member is particularly heavy if he attacks the union's\n\nfailure to appeal from . . . a proceeding untainted by any union\n\nfailure to represent its members in good faith\").\n\n          This case follows the classic pattern for a hybrid\n\nsection 301 action.   It involves an assessment of the actions of\n\nSpalding and the Union against the background understanding of\n\n\"proper cause\" as that term is used in the CBA.      The matter is\n\ncomplicated, however, because the principal allegation against\n\nMulvihill — the charge of sexual harassment — implicates Title VII\n\n\n                               -10-\n\fof the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e to 2000e-17.\n\nEmployee-claimants in hybrid section 301 actions that impinge upon\n\nan employer's responsibilities under Title VII must carry an\n\nespecially heavy burden.   That is so because the presence of Title\n\nVII transforms the case from a relatively simple two-variable\n\nequation that aspires to strike a suitable balance between an\n\nemployee's rights and an employer's hegemony into a more complex\n\nthree-variable analysis in which that balance must be struck while\n\nsimultaneously ensuring that important federal anti-discrimination\n\npolicies are honored.   See Malik v. Carrier Corp., 202 F.3d 97, 106\n\n(2d Cir. 2000).\n\n          Although the case law is sparse, we think that our\n\nconclusion as to the relative weight of the employee's burden is\n\nsolidly based.    Title VII \"vest[s] federal courts with plenary\n\npowers to enforce the statutory requirements.\"        Alexander v.\n\nGardner-Denver Co., 415 U.S. 36, 47 (1974).       Consequently, \"an\n\nemployer's investigation of a sexual harassment complaint is not a\n\ngratuitous or optional undertaking[] under federal law.\"     Malik,\n\n202 F.3d at 105 (citing Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S.\n\n775 (1998)).     To the contrary, federal law exerts considerable\n\npressure on employers to make certain that employees refrain from\n\nsexually harassing conduct.    See id. at 106; see also Burlington\n\nIndus., Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, 764 (1998) (explaining that\n\n\"Title VII is designed to encourage the creation of antiharassment\n\n\n                                -11-\n\fpolicies    and   effective    [complaint]    mechanisms\"    for   reporting\n\nharassing conduct).\n\n            Following this logic, it is evident that when sexually\n\ncharged innuendo contaminates a workplace and creates an abusive\n\nenvironment, Title VII is violated — and the violation constitutes\n\nan unlawful employment practice.         See Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore\n\nServ. Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 78 (1998) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n\n2(a)(1)).    But there is a rub:        the pressure to enforce Title VII\n\nis in obvious tension with the fundamental doctrine upon which\n\nemployer liability under section 301 is premised — a doctrine that\n\nholds   employers     liable     for     misunderstandings    between    its\n\ninvestigators and accused employees.          See Malik, 202 F.3d at 107\n\n(explaining that \"if employers must fear . . . liability based on\n\nex post findings, they will be deterred from taking reasonable\n\ncorrective action . . . as required by federal law\").          Easing that\n\ntension requires courts to erect a decisional framework that allows\n\na certain amount of play in the joints.             We pause briefly to\n\nexplain.\n\n            \"Congress gave private individuals a significant role in\n\nthe enforcement process of Title VII.\"         Alexander, 415 U.S. at 45.\n\nIt would be counterproductive for federal courts, in whom Congress\n\nhas vested \"final responsibility for enforcement of Title VII,\" id.\n\nat 44, to insist upon de novo review of actions taken by an\n\nemployer to eradicate sexual harassment in the workplace.                 If\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\ffederal courts are to give effect to the antiharassment policies\n\nencouraged by Title VII, they must defer, within wide limits, both\n\nto an employer's determination that sexual harassment has sullied\n\nthe workplace and to its conception of an appropriate response.\n\nCf. Williams v. Maremont Corp., 875 F.2d 1476, 1485 (10th Cir.\n\n1989) (applying this rationale in wrongful discharge case based on\n\nstate law).   The law should not require an employer, charged with\n\nresponsibilities under Title VII, to wait until it is sued and\n\nfound liable in a gender discrimination case before it can take\n\nsteps necessary to prevent or eliminate a hostile work environment.\n\n          This brings us to the degree of deference.    Because the\n\nemployer in such cases vindicates the important congressional\n\npolicies against discriminatory employment practices, it fulfills\n\na quasi-administrative function.      See Alexander, 415 U.S. at 47\n\n(explaining that \"legislative enactments in this area have long\n\nevinced a general intent to accord parallel or overlapping remedies\n\nagainst discrimination\").   By analogy, then, a court should uphold\n\nthe employer's actions so long as those actions are justified by\n\nsubstantial evidence. Cf. Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U.S.\n\n474, 488 (1951) (elucidating \"substantial evidence\" standard);\n\nProvidence Hosp. v. NLRB, 93 F.3d 1012, 1016 (1st Cir. 1996)\n\n(same).   We adopt this rule for hybrid section 301 actions that\n\nimplicate Title VII concerns. Thus, when an employer discharges an\n\nemployee in the exercise of its Title VII responsibilities, and the\n\n\n                               -13-\n\femployee retorts by suing the employer and his union, we think that\n\nthe vector of these competing forces requires the employee to\n\ndemonstrate that the record is devoid of any substantial evidence\n\nsupporting the discharge.2\n\n                   C.   The Breach of Contract Claim.\n\n            With these precepts in mind, we proceed to the merits of\n\nthe case.     Mulvihill hypothesizes that Spalding discharged him\n\nwithout \"proper cause\" as that term is used in the CBA.        We test\n\nthis hypothesis.\n\n            Whether the undisputed facts in a specific case establish\n\n— or fail to establish — proper cause for discharge within the\n\ncontemplation of a given CBA is a question of law (and, thus, a\n\nquestion for the court).     Crider, 130 F.3d at 1242.   The concept of\n\nproper cause demands a close, albeit not exact, correlation between\n\nthe employee's conduct and the employer's response.        Boston Med.\n\nCtr. v. Serv. Employees Int'l Union, 260 F.3d 16, 22 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).\n\n            In this case, the question of whether proper cause exists\n\nto sustain the employee's discharge intersects with the question of\n\nwhether the record contains substantial evidence.        After all, to\n\n\n\n     2\n      Such deference to factual determinations and interpretations\nof private contract disputes is consistent with federal labor law\nwhen issues of well-defined and dominant public policy are at\nstake. See E. Associated Coal Corp. v. United Mine Workers, 531\nU.S. 57, 62 (2000); Boston Med. Ctr. v. Serv. Employees Int'l\nUnion, 260 F.3d 16, 23 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n                                  -14-\n\ffind substantial evidence supporting the adverse employment action\n\nfor Title VII purposes but not for purposes of a broadly worded\n\nmanagement     rights    provision     in     the   CBA    would    frustrate   the\n\nlegislative policies at stake.          See id. at 23; see also Williams,\n\n875 F.2d at 1485.            It follows, therefore, that if Spalding's\n\nactions rested on substantial evidence, then Spalding acted with\n\nproper cause within the meaning of the CBA.                        Accordingly, we\n\nscrutinize the record to determine whether substantial evidence\n\nsupported Spalding's conclusion that Mulvihill had engaged in\n\nsexually harassing conduct, warranting dismissal.\n\n              In sexual harassment cases, \"the objective severity of\n\nharassment should be judged from the perspective of a reasonable\n\nperson    in    the     [employee]'s        position      considering    all    the\n\ncircumstances.\"        Oncale, 523 U.S. at 81 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).      We caution, however, that Title VII was not meant to\n\nprotect thin-skinned employees. The statutory scheme \"forbids only\n\nbehavior so objectively offensive as to alter the conditions of the\n\nvictim's employment.          Conduct that is not severe or pervasive\n\nenough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment\n\n. . . is beyond Title VII's purview.\"                  Id. (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).        By the same token, we caution that because the\n\nanalysis requires an objective test, any subjectively benevolent or\n\nconstructive intent on the part of the putative harasser will not\n\njustify   a    court    in   second-guessing        the   employer's     decision.\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\fRather, \"[c]ommon sense, and an appropriate sensitivity to social\n\ncontext\" must guide the analysis.            Id. at 82.\n\n           Here, substantial evidence in the summary judgment record\n\nshows that Spalding had proper cause to discharge Mulvihill.                    The\n\nsocial context in which Mulvihill's behavior occurred was an\n\nindustrial workplace.        Spalding had adopted an explicit sexual\n\nharassment policy, administered pursuant to Title VII and the\n\ncounterpart state statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, § 3A(b), and\n\nhad warned its work force that it took that policy seriously.\n\nCommon sense suggests that a reasonable person, aware of the\n\npolicy, could not have justified discussing the involvement of two\n\ncoworkers in an extra-marital affair with a third-party member of\n\nthe work force who had no legitimate interest in the subject\n\nmatter. More importantly, from an objective standpoint Mulvihill's\n\ncomments   altered     the   conditions      of    Charest's       employment   and\n\nunreasonably     interfered    with    her        work   performance.        Thus,\n\nsubstantial    record    evidence     provides       a   firm   foundation      for\n\nSpalding's     conclusion    that    Mulvihill's         conduct    violated    the\n\ncompany's published sexual harassment policy.\n\n             This same evidence also validates Spalding's claim that\n\nthe discharge was a reasonable response to Mulvihill's misconduct.\n\nSpalding's    sexual    harassment    policy       stated   unequivocally       that\n\npotential punishments for violations included dismissal.                        The\n\nrecord makes manifest that once Charest filed a formal complaint,\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fSpalding assigned the matter to a senior officer (Bourdeau).\n\nBourdeau   promptly         interviewed    key     witnesses       to   determine   the\n\nveracity of the allegation that Mulvihill was telling tawdry tales.\n\nWhen Bourdeau afforded Mulvihill the opportunity to explain his\n\nbehavior, Mulvihill did not disclaim the substance of the comments\n\nattributed to him by others.               Instead, he insisted that he had\n\nacted appropriately because his discussion of the affair with\n\nCharest's husband related only to the truth of the situation (and,\n\nthus,   the    discussion      could     not     constitute    harassment).         The\n\ntortured      nature   of     this   logic      itself     lends    support    to   the\n\nemployer's ultimate decision.             It is bad enough when an employee\n\nacts in a sexually harassing manner; it is even worse when he\n\ncannot see the failings in his own conduct.\n\n              Based    on    Bourdeau's        investigation,       Spalding    deemed\n\ntermination to be the appropriate remedy.                  As the record contains\n\nsubstantial      support      for    a   finding    that    Mulvihill's       behavior\n\nconstituted sexual harassment, we have no basis to second-guess the\n\ndecision to fire him.           See Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 825 (\"Courts may\n\nnot sit as super personnel departments, assessing the merits . . .\n\nof employers' nondiscriminatory business decisions.\").                         By like\n\ntoken, we cannot disturb that decision under a proper application\n\nof the substantial evidence standard.                 See Providence Hosp., 93\n\nF.3d at 1016.     Mulvihill's refusal to acknowledge the wrongfulness\n\nof his conduct gave Spalding all the more reason to discharge him\n\n\n                                          -17-\n\fbecause there could be no assurance that Mulvihill would cease his\n\nharassing activities.         See Malik, 202 F.3d at 107 (reasoning that\n\nworst-case scenarios must govern review when employer cannot assume\n\nthat harassing behavior is likely to stop).\n\n           This ends our inquiry into whether the record contains\n\nsubstantial evidentiary support sufficient to ground Mulvihill's\n\ndischarge.   We hold that it does.          As explained above, this holding\n\nnecessarily means that Spalding acted with proper cause within the\n\npurview of the CBA.             See Boston Med. Ctr., 260 F.3d at 23;\n\nWilliams, 875 F.2d at 1485.\n\n           To   be    sure,     Mulvihill    resists    the    conclusion   that\n\nSpalding had proper cause to discharge him under the terms of the\n\nCBA.   To this end, he makes a litany of arguments.             None has merit.\n\n           He starts with the strange proposition that, by embedding\n\nthe \"proper cause\" standard in the CBA, Spalding had surrendered\n\nthe right to determine the existence vel non of proper cause and\n\nleft that determination to an arbitrator.              Building on this shaky\n\nfoundation, he argues that Spalding was contractually bound to\n\nsubmit the propriety of any proposed discharge to arbitration.\n\nThis argument flies in the teeth of both federal labor law and the\n\nplain language of the CBA.\n\n           \"[F]ederal labor law is chiefly designed to promote []\n\nthe    formation     of   the   collective     agreement      and   the   private\n\nsettlement of disputes under it.\"              Int'l Union, UAW v. Hoosier\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\fCardinal Corp., 383 U.S. 696, 702 (1966).            As a general matter,\n\ntherefore, arbitration is preferred over litigation in resolving\n\nprivate labor disputes.       See generally United Steelworkers v.\n\nWarrior & Gulf Navig. Co., 363 U.S. 574, 581-82 (1960) (discussing\n\nbenefits of arbitration).        But it is not arbitration per se that\n\nfederal policy favors; rather, it is the settlement of disputes by\n\nthe means mutually agreed upon by the parties themselves — whatever\n\nthose means may be.    See McCreedy, 809 F.2d at 1237.         By enforcing\n\nthe results of choices freely made by labor and management, acting\n\nin   concert,    federal   law     \"promote[s]   a    higher    degree     of\n\nresponsibility upon the parties to such agreements, and . . .\n\nthereby promote[s] industrial peace.\"        Textile Workers Union v.\n\nLincoln Mills, 353 U.S. 448, 454 (1957).\n\n          In this case, the process to which the parties agreed for\n\nsettling differences is embodied in Article 9 of the CBA.                That\n\narticle outlines a two-step procedure for resolving grievances.\n\nThe first step sets various time limits for processing written\n\ngrievances.     The second step contemplates that \"[i]f the Company's\n\n[first-step] answer is unsatisfactory to the Union,\" then the\n\ngrievance \"shall be submitted to arbitration.\" That clause further\n\nprovides, however, that \"[i]f the Union has not submitted a request\n\nfor arbitration with[in] thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of\n\nthe step one answer, the grievance shall be considered settled on\n\nthe basis of [the employer's] answer.\"\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\f           There     is   no    language    in    the   CBA     that   guarantees\n\nindividual employees that every grievance will be arbitrated.                  To\n\nthe contrary, the grievance procedure leaves to the Union's sole\n\ndiscretion the decision as to whether to request arbitration. Such\n\nprovisions are common fare in CBAs — and where they exist, courts\n\ntypically cede the union considerable leeway in evaluating the\n\nmerit associated with a particular grievance and the resources that\n\nit will expend to prosecute that grievance.                   Miller v. United\n\nStates Postal Serv., 985 F.2d 9, 12 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n           Viewed against this backdrop, it is evident that Spalding\n\nand the Union reached a final settlement of Mulvihill's grievance\n\nwhen Spalding denied it and the Union elected not to pursue the\n\nmatter   further.3        As   between   the     parties   to    the   CBA,   that\n\ndetermination was \"valid, binding, and enforceable.\"                      Textile\n\nWorkers, 353 U.S. at 454.        Since Spalding surrendered authority to\n\ndischarge for proper cause only to the extent specified in the CBA,\n\nMulvihill's argument that he had an absolute right to arbitration\n\nwill not wash.\n\n           Mulvihill next asseverates that deferring to the results\n\nof Spalding's investigation violates the summary judgment standard\n\nand, in the bargain, denigrates the importance of employee rights\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      As an aside, the record indicates that the Union at first\nintended to arbitrate the grievance but chose not to do so after\nassessing the strength of Spalding's case.\n\n                                     -20-\n\funder collective bargaining agreements.                 This asseveration lacks\n\nforce.\n\n              As we have explained, Mulvihill bears the burden of\n\ndemonstrating that Spalding discharged him in derogation of the\n\nCBA.   Hines, 424 U.S. at 570.            Because he has failed to do so, we\n\nare bound to honor the final settlement reached by the parties\n\nunder the terms of the CBA.         See E. Associated Coal Corp. v. United\n\nMine Workers, 531 U.S. 57, 62 (2000); Boston Med. Ctr., 260 F.3d at\n\n21.      In    this    context,    we     are    not   deferring    to   Spalding's\n\ndetermination that proper cause existed, but, rather, to the\n\noutcome of the grievance procedure described in the CBA.                         See\n\nDelCostello, 462 U.S. at 164 (\"Subject to very limited judicial\n\nreview, [parties to a CBA] will be bound by the result according to\n\nthe finality provisions of the agreement.\"). The federal policy of\n\nsettling labor disputes by privately arranged procedures would be\n\ncompromised if courts had the final say on the merits of every\n\nsettlement.        See El Dorado Tech. Servs., Inc. v. Union Gen. De\n\nTrabajadores, 961 F.2d 317, 319 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n              In   a   related    vein,    Mulvihill     contends    that   several\n\nfactual       issues   surrounding      Spalding's      investigation       preclude\n\nsummary judgment.         None of his prolix argumentation exposes any\n\nmaterial fact sufficient to derail the summary judgment train.\n\n               First, Mulvihill posits that a reasonable juror could\n\nfind that his conduct was that of a concerned employee hoping to\n\n\n                                          -21-\n\fdiffuse a potentially explosive situation, not that of a sexual\n\nharasser.   This thesis runs along the following lines.      Mulvihill\n\nsays that it is reasonable to infer that Spalding acted without\n\nproper cause because a more thorough investigation would have\n\nrevealed the following facts.        (1) While Todd Charest was at\n\nMulvihill's home to estimate the costs of a needed roof repair, he\n\ninquired whether Mulvihill had heard any rumors that his wife was\n\ninvolved in a sexual liaison with Mike Rattell.          (2) Mulvihill\n\nreplied that he had heard \"shop talk\" about such a tryst.        (3) When\n\nTodd   Charest   asked   for   Melissa   Rattell's   telephone   number,\n\nMulvihill told him that he did not have it but that he would give\n\nTodd's number to Melissa so that she could contact him if she so\n\nchose.   (4) Mulvihill then gave Melissa Rattell the telephone\n\nnumber and told her of his conversation with Todd Charest.        (5) He\n\nthen recounted these conversations to his supervisor, Montessi,\n\nbelieving that the situation could have detrimental effects for the\n\nworking environment.     (6) According to Mulvihill, Montessi wanted\n\nnothing to do with the matter and walked away.       (7) Later the same\n\nday, Perreault noticed that Amy Charest was not at work and\n\nexpressed concern about her increased absenteeism and substandard\n\njob performance.   (8) When Perreault asked Mulvihill if he knew of\n\nanything that might be affecting her work, Mulvihill told Perreault\n\nof his conversations with Todd Charest and Melissa Rattell.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -22-\n\f           Even if the record supports this chain of sanguine\n\ninferences — a matter on which we take no view — Mulvihill's\n\nanalysis is misguided.      The question here is not whether Amy\n\nCharest and Mike Rattell were actually engaged in an extra-marital\n\naffair. Nor is the question whether Mulvihill's actions were well-\n\nintentioned.    The fact is that Spalding, after due investigation,\n\nreasonably concluded that Mulvihill's remarks about the alleged\n\naffair, regardless of either their accuracy or their purpose,\n\nunnecessarily created a hostile work environment for Amy Charest\n\n(and,   thus,   violated   Spalding's   published   sexual   harassment\n\npolicy).   This reasonable conclusion constituted proper cause for\n\nSpalding to discharge Mulvihill.    Seen in this light, Mulvihill's\n\ninferential chain, even if credited, would not alter any material\n\nfact.   See Morris, 27 F.3d at 748 (explaining that a fact, to be\n\nmaterial, must have the capacity to affect the outcome of the\n\nsuit); see also Malik, 202 F.3d at 107.\n\n           The next factual dispute to which Mulvihill alludes\n\ninvolves the extent of Spalding's investigation.      In this regard,\n\nhe draws our attention to the statement in Spalding's sexual\n\nharassment policy that \"no disciplinary action will be taken\n\nwithout a thorough investigation of the facts which shall include\n\ngathering of statements from all parties and witnesses involved in\n\nthe matter.\"    From this launching pad, he jumps to the conclusion\n\nthat Spalding's investigation was not conducted in good faith (or,\n\n\n                                 -23-\n\fat least, that a jury could so find) because Bourdeau neglected to\n\ninterview   three   potential      witnesses.     This   suggestion    cannot\n\nwithstand scrutiny.\n\n            The persons that Bourdeau decided not to interview were\n\nMike Rattell, Melissa Rattell, and Todd Charest.                 Mulvihill's\n\nattack overlooks that Bourdeau reasonably concluded that he did not\n\nneed to talk to these individuals because the issue was not whether\n\na meretricious relationship existed, but, rather, whether Mulvihill\n\nwas conversing with his coworkers about Amy Charest's sex life.\n\nThere is no evidence in the record that suggests that the three\n\nnamed    individuals   had   any    personal    knowledge   as   to   whether\n\nMulvihill engaged in gossip-mongering.          Thus, the decision not to\n\ninterview them was well within the employer's broad discretion.             A\n\nfortiori, that decision was insufficient to raise a genuine issue\n\nof material fact anent Spalding's good faith.4           See Williams, 875\n\nF.2d at 1485.\n\n            Mulvihill also maintains that there are factual issues\n\nregarding the validity of the accusations against him.                This is\n\n\n\n     4\n      We hasten to add that even were we to assume that the failure\nto interview one or more of these individuals constituted a\nviolation of Spalding's announced protocol, it would not\nnecessarily undercut the entry of summary judgment. After all,\n\"[t]he grievance processes cannot be expected to be error-free.\nThe finality provision has sufficient force to surmount occasional\ninstances of mistake.\"       Hines, 424 U.S. at 571.        Because\n\"[e]fficiency is a fundamental concern of both union and\nmanagement\" in hybrid section 301 actions, minor errors are\ntolerable. McCreedy, 809 F.2d at 1238.\n\n                                     -24-\n\ftrue as far as it goes — but it does not go very far.                  The\n\ninvestigation   reveals   that   all   of   the   witnesses   agreed   that\n\nMulvihill had commented in the most crude and offensive terms about\n\na sexual liaison between Amy Charest and Mike Rattell.             Although\n\nMulvihill admits his role in the discussions, he denies that he\n\nused uncouth language.      That asserted factual dispute has no\n\nbearing on our analysis. There is no evidence that Charest herself\n\nwas exposed to Mulvihill's comments at first hand and, in all\n\nevents, the violation that sparked Mulvihill's ouster did not\n\ndepend on the phraseology that he used. Whether Mulvihill spoke to\n\nhis coworkers with the saltiness of a sailor or the eloquence of a\n\nShakespearean scholar, it was the essence of his statements that\n\ncreated the hostile work environment.          The linguistic trappings\n\nwere, at most, the icing on the cake.       Hence, Mulvihill again fails\n\nto limn a material dispute sufficient to block summary judgment.\n\n          Finally,   Mulvihill     asserts     that   Spalding's     sexual\n\nharassment policy only prohibited \"spreading false rumors.\"              To\n\nbolster this argument, he points to a company manual describing \"on\n\nthe job conduct,\" which specifically cites the spreading of false\n\nrumors as violative of \"proper standards of conduct.\"\n\n          This argument is hopeless.        For one thing, the record is\n\ndevoid of any evidence that Spalding ever limited its sexual\n\nharassment policy to conform to this description.             For another\n\nthing, the fact that Mulvihill's salacious statements may have been\n\n\n                                  -25-\n\ftrue — a matter that we need not decide — would not alter the fact\n\nthat his dissemination of them to Charest's coworkers violated the\n\ncompany's sexual harassment policy and fomented a hostile work\n\nenvironment.\n\n          Although Mulvihill's asseverational array contains a\n\nsmattering of other arguments, none warrants discussion.                We\n\nconclude, therefore, that Spalding had proper cause for cashiering\n\nMulvihill and that, under the CBA, it bears no liability for\n\nwrongful discharge.\n\n                D.    The Fair Representation Claim.\n\n          Our conclusion that Spalding did not breach the CBA when\n\nit terminated Mulvihill's employment serves to dispose of his case\n\nagainst the Union as well.     To prevail against either defendant in\n\na hybrid section 301 action, a plaintiff must show that the\n\nemployer discharged him in derogation of the CBA. DelCostello, 462\n\nU.S. at 165.   Because we have determined that Mulvihill failed to\n\ncarry this burden, see supra Part II(C), his suit against the Union\n\nnecessarily fails.\n\n                      E.   The Defamation Claim.\n\n          Mulvihill's      complaint   also   contained   a   claim   that\n\nSpalding, by labeling him as a sexual harasser, defamed him.           The\n\ndistrict court entered summary judgment against him on this claim,\n\nand Mulvihill appeals.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -26-\n\f          This aspect of the case need not occupy us for long.        \"We\n\nhave steadfastly   deemed   waived   issues   raised   on   appeal   in   a\n\nperfunctory manner, not accompanied by developed argumentation.\"\n\nUnited States v. Bongiorno, 106 F.3d 1027, 1034 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\nAn issue falls into this category when, for example, the proponent\n\nmentions it as \"a possible argument in the most skeletal way,\n\nleaving the court to do counsel's work.\" United States v. Zannino,\n\n895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).      So it is here.\n\n          After citing to his own self-serving testimony to the\n\neffect that some of his associates told him that they had heard he\n\nwas fired for sexual harassment, Mulvihill makes the general\n\nassertion that the \"record before the court contains an abundance\n\nof evidence which a jury could credit showing this charge to be\n\nfalse, and that defendant Spalding knew that Mulvihill did not\n\nsexually harass anyone.\"     Appellant's Br. at 45.         That is the\n\nbeginning and the end of his argument vis-à-vis the defamation\n\ncount.   He makes no attempt either to marshal the pertinent facts\n\nor to engage in reasoned analysis.\n\n          This treatment is too perfunctory to preserve the issue\n\nfor appeal.   Mulvihill has done no more than point in a desultory\n\nmanner to a welter of paper — the record appendix comprises almost\n\n1,400 pages — without \"array[ing] these plethoric evidentiary\n\nmaterials in any systematic way\" with respect to his putative cause\n\nof action.    Mass. Sch. of Law at Andover, Inc. v. Am. Bar Ass'n,\n\n\n                                -27-\n\f142 F.3d 26, 43 (1st Cir. 1998).            That amounts to an invitation\n\nthat we ransack the record, research the law, and make his argument\n\nfor him.      We decline the invitation.      See Zannino, 895 F.2d at 17.\n\nConsequently, we deem the argument waived.5\n\nIII.       CONCLUSION\n\n               We need go no further.       While courts should give broad\n\nlatitude to employers in investigating charges of sexual harassment\n\nin the workplace, the federal interest in eradicating sexual\n\nharassment must nonetheless be balanced against the equally strong\n\nfederal interest        in   protecting   inadequately   represented   union\n\nemployees from wrongful discharge.           To achieve this balance, the\n\nlaw allows an employee who is fired for sexual harassment to\n\nprevail in an ensuing hybrid section 301 action only if he can show\n\nthat the employer lacked a substantial evidentiary basis for its\n\ndetermination that he was guilty of sexual harassment.           Mulvihill\n\nhas failed by a wide margin to make this showing.              He also has\n\nfailed to make out a prima facie case of defamation.          Accordingly,\n\nwe affirm the entry of summary judgment in the defendants' favor.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n       5\n      In all events, there was no discernible defamation. Based\nupon the undisputed facts, Mulvihill, while at work, discussed\nCharest's sex life with their coworkers. He thereby contravened\nSpalding's sexual harassment policy. See supra Part II(C). For\nworkplace purposes, that made him guilty of sexual harassment.\nUnder those circumstances, it is hard to imagine how Spalding's\nalleged publication could have been actionable.\n\n                                     -28-\n\f",

(Spalding) had terminated his employment without proper cause,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> plaintiff-appellant Martin J. Mulvihill asked his union &#8212; Local 1851 of the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers and Helpers (the Union) &#8212; to prosecute a grievance against Spalding pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement then in effect (the CBA). The Union did so. But when Spalding rejected the grievance, the Union refused to bring the matter to arbitration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mulvihill subsequently brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against Spalding and the Union. In due course, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of both defendants. Mulvihill appeals. Concluding, as we do, that Spalding acted with proper cause, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We present the facts derived from the record in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment (here, the plaintiff). <i>See Plumley v. S. Container, Inc.,</i> 303 F.3d 364, 367 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mulvihill began his tour of duty at Spalding in 1969. At the times material hereto, a CBA was in effect between Spalding and the Union. The CBA included a management rights provision, which stated, inter alia, that Spalding would \"continue to direct working forces, including the right to ... discharge [employees] for proper cause.\" The CBA also mapped out a standard grievance mechanism. Under it, an offended employee could lodge a grievance with a Union-organized committee and expect the grievance committee to press Spalding to resolve the complaint. If that failed, the Union had the right to compel Spalding to proceed to binding arbitration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mulvihill, a long-time Union member, held a job within the bargaining unit. In 2000, a coworker, Amy Charest, accused him of sexual harassment. Acting on Charest's formal complaint, Spalding conducted an investigation. The results of that probe led it to terminate Mulvihill's employment. Contending that Spalding had discharged him without proper cause, Mulvihill submitted a grievance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Buoyed by Mulvihill's thirty-two years of service, the Union's grievance committee lobbied Spalding to reconsider its decision, reinstate Mulvihill, and award him back pay. The main thrust of the Union's argument was that discharge was \"too serious\" a remedy for the asserted misconduct. Spalding rejected the Union's importunings, pointing to Charest's complaint and the results of its investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In her complaint, Charest had accused Mulvihill of: spreading \"false rumors\" within the company to the effect that she was \"having an affair\" with a fellow employee named Mike Rattell; telling Rattell's wife &#8212; who also worked for Spalding &#8212; about the alleged affair; \"interfering with [Charest's] personal life\" and making her feel \"violated\"; and creating a situation in which Charest found it \"emotionally and physically ... hard [to] concentrat[e] on [her] work.\" Spalding's investigation into these remonstrances revealed the following undisputed facts. On September 7, 2000, Charest's husband, Todd, had gone to Mulvihill's home on matters unrelated to this dispute. The two discussed Charest's putative involvement in a sexual relationship with Rattell and Mulvihill agreed to give Todd Charest's telephone number to Rattell's wife (Melissa) so that she could contact him regarding their spouses' suspected infidelity. Mulvihill passed the telephone number to Melissa Rattell at work the following day. He proceeded to tell two other Spalding employees (Domenic Montessi and Ray Perreault) about the alleged affair. According to them, he supplied graphic detail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Spalding's sexual harassment policy prohibits \"sexual discrimination or harassment which undermines the employment relationship by creating an intimidating, hostile, and offensive work environment.\" The policy specifically defines verbal harassment to include \"spreading rumors about a coworker's sex life\" and forbids any such conduct that may \"unreasonably interfere[ ] with an employee's work performance.\" The executive in charge of the investigation, Robert Bourdeau, concluded that Mulvihill's behavior transgressed the policy and created a working environment that Charest reasonably found offensive. After consulting with senior management, Bourdeau terminated Mulvihill's employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As said, the Union initially processed a grievance on Mulvihill's behalf. When Spalding resisted, the Union accepted Spalding's response, ignored Mulvihill's protests, and allowed the matter to die on the vine. After the deadline for submitting the grievance to arbitration had passed, Mulvihill filed suit against Spalding and the Union. His complaint asserted, inter alia, that (1) Spalding had violated section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 185, by cashiering him without proper cause (in derogation of the CBA), and (2) the Union had failed to heed its duty fairly to represent him with respect to Spalding's breach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This sort of double-barreled suit is known as a hybrid section 301 action. <i>See, e.g., Arriaga-Zayas v. Int'l Ladies' Garment Workers' Union,</i> 835 F.2d 11, 12 (1st Cir.1987). While it is composed of two causes of action &#8212; one against the employer and the other against the union &#8212; the claims are inextricably intertwined. <i>See DelCostello v. Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters,</i> 462 U.S. 151, 164-65, 103 S.Ct. 2281, 76 L.Ed.2d 476 (1983). This imbrication is underscored by the fact that in order to prevail against either defendant, the employee must establish that the employer breached the CBA. <i>Id.</i> at 165, 103 S.Ct. 2281.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court determined, at the summary judgment stage, that Spalding had acted with proper cause in discharging Mulvihill (and, therefore, had not breached the CBA). On this basis, the court disposed of the section 301 claims. Mulvihill also had asserted a defamation claim, and the court found that claim wanting as well. This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin our analysis with a reiteration of the by-now-familiar summary judgment standard. We then provide an overview of the interaction between hybrid section 301 actions and Title VII. Finally, we turn to the merits of Mulvihill's claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>The Summary Judgment Standard.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The role of summary judgment is to look behind the facade erected by the pleadings and assay the parties' proof in order to determine whether a trial will serve any useful purpose. <i>Plumley,</i> 303 F.3d at 368. Conventional summary judgment practice requires the moving party to assert the absence of a genuine issue of material fact and then support that assertion by affidavits, admissions, or other materials of evidentiary quality. <i>Quintero de Quintero v. Aponte-Roque,</i> 974 F.2d 226, 227-28 (1st Cir.1992). Once the movant has done its part, the burden shifts to the summary judgment target to demonstrate that a trialworthy issue exists. <i>Suarez v. Pueblo Int'l, Inc.,</i> 229 F.3d 49, 53 (1st Cir.2000). When all is said and done, summary judgment will lie only if the \"pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In conducting this tamisage, the district court must scrutinize the record in the light most flattering to the party opposing the motion, indulging all reasonable inferences in that party's favor. <i>Morris v. Gov't Dev. Bank,</i> 27 F.3d 746, 748 (1st Cir.1994). This standard is notoriously liberal &#8212; but its liberality does not relieve the nonmovant of the burden of producing specific facts sufficient to deflect the swing of the summary judgment scythe. <i>Id.</i> Moreover, the factual conflicts relied upon by the nonmovant must be both genuine and material. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). For this purpose, \"genuine\" means that the evidence is such that a reasonable factfinder could resolve the point in favor of the nonmoving party, and \"material\" means that the fact is one that might affect the outcome of the suit under the applicable law. <i>Morris,</i> 27 F.3d at 748.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This same paradigm governs our de novo review of a district court's summary judgment rulings. <i>Plumley,</i> 303 F.3d at 369. There is, however, one important distinction. The court of appeals \"is not restricted to the district court's reasoning but can affirm a summary judgment on any independently sufficient ground\" made manifest in the record. <i>Mesnick v. Gen. Elec. Co.,</i> 950 F.2d 816, 822 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The Governing Law.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal common law supplies the substantive rules for adjudicating interlocked claims against an employer and a trade union for breach of a CBA. <i>See Crider v. Spectrulite Consortium, Inc.,</i> 130 F.3d 1238, 1242 (7th Cir.1997); <i>see also Fant v. New Engl. Power Serv.,</i> 239 F.3d 8,14 (1st Cir.2001) (\"In creating &#167; 301 of the LMRA, Congress intended that a comprehensive, unified, body of federal law should govern actions concerning the interpretation and enforcement of collective bargaining agreements.\") (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the CBA allowed Spalding to take certain personnel actions (including dismissal) for \"proper cause.\" Spalding concluded that it had such cause and fired Mulvihill. The Union refrained from testing that conclusion through arbitration. In run-of-the-mine actions, the finality provisions of the CBA would operate to preclude judicial review of such a determination. <i>See Abernathy v. United States Postal Serv.,</i> 740 F.2d 612, 617 (8th Cir.1984). But hybrid section 301 cases are fundamentally different. Because a hybrid section 301 action, by definition, involves a claim of inadequate union representation, the employer's determination can be overcome if the claimant can show, inter alia, that the adverse employment action contravened the CBA. <i>Hines v. Anchor Motor Freight, Inc.,</i> 424 U.S. 554, 567, 96 S.Ct. 1048, 47 L.Ed.2d 231 (1976). In this way, the law opens a remedial avenue for an employee \"who has been injured by both the employer's and the union's breach.\" <i>Bowen v. United States Postal Serv.,</i> 459 U.S. 212, 222, 103 S.Ct. 588, 74 L.Ed.2d 402 (1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although this remedial avenue can lead to make-whole relief, there is no guarantee of safe passage. Typically, claimants attempting to make the requisite showing in hybrid section 301 actions must carry a heavy burden. Such claimants \"are not entitled to relitigate their discharge[s] merely because they offer newly discovered evidence that the charges against them were false and that they in fact were fired without [sufficient] cause.\" <i>Hines,</i> 424 U.S. at 571, 96 S.Ct. 1048. Rather, such a case may proceed only if, and to the extent that, the claimant can show that the checks and balances built into the CBA's internal dispute resolution process have failed to function. <i>See McCreedy v. Local Union No. 971,</i> 809 F.2d 1232, 1238 (6th Cir.1987). To reach this safe harbor, the claimant must prove an erroneous discharge, a breach of duty on the union's part, and a causal nexus between the two, that is, \"that [the] union's breach of its duty `seriously undermine[d] the integrity of the [grievance] process.'\" <i>United Parcel Serv., Inc. v. Mitchell,</i> 451 U.S. 56, 61, 101 S.Ct. 1559, 67 L.Ed.2d 732 (1981) (quoting <i>Hines,</i> 424 U.S. at 567, 96 S.Ct. 1048).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let us be perfectly clear. Proof of the required nexus does not entail a \"but for\" causal connection between the union's breach of duty and the erroneous discharge. <i>Webb v. ABF Freight Sys., Inc.,</i> 155 F.3d 1230, 1242 (10th Cir.1998). It does, however, require the claimant to produce sufficient evidence from which a reasonable factfinder can conclude not only that the discharge was improper but also that the union's breach undermined the grievance process and thereby contributed to the error. <i>See Thomas v. United Parcel Serv., Inc.,</i> 890 F.2d 909, 915 (7th Cir. 1989); <i>Apperson v. Fleet Carrier Corp.,</i> 879 F.2d 1344, 1355 (6th Cir.1989); <i>see also Sear v. Cadillac Auto. Co. of Boston,</i> 654 F.2d 4, 7 (1st Cir.1981) (Breyer, J.) (noting that \"[t]he burden ... upon a union member is particularly heavy if he attacks the union's failure to appeal from... a proceeding untainted by any union failure to represent its members in good faith\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case follows the classic pattern for a hybrid section 301 action. It involves an assessment of the actions of Spalding and the Union against the background understanding of \"proper cause\" as that term is used in the CBA. The matter is complicated, however, because the principal allegation against Mulvihill &#8212; the charge of sexual harassment &#8212; implicates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2000e to 2000e-17. Employee-claimants in hybrid section 301 actions that impinge upon an employer's responsibilities under Title VII must carry an especially heavy burden. That is so because the presence of Title VII transforms the case from a relatively simple two-variable equation that aspires to strike a suitable balance between an employee's rights and an employer's hegemony into a more complex three-variable analysis in which that balance must be struck while simultaneously ensuring that important federal anti-discrimination policies are honored. <i>See Malik v. Carrier Corp.,</i> 202 F.3d 97, 106 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the case law is sparse, we think that our conclusion as to the relative weight of the employee's burden is solidly based. Title VII \"vest[s] federal courts with plenary powers to enforce the statutory requirements.\" <i>Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co.,</i> 415 U.S. 36, 47, 94 S.Ct. 1011, 39 L.Ed.2d 147 (1974). Consequently, \"an employer's investigation of a sexual harassment complaint is not a gratuitous or optional undertaking[ ] under federal law.\" <i>Malik,</i> 202 F.3d at 105 (citing <i>Faragher v. City of Boca Raton,</i> 524 U.S. 775, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998)). To the contrary, federal law exerts considerable pressure on employers to make certain that employees refrain from sexually harassing conduct. <i>See id.</i> at 106; <i>see also Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth,</i> 524 U.S. 742, 764, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 141 L.Ed.2d 633 (1998) (explaining that \"Title VII is designed to encourage the creation of anti-harassment policies and effective [complaint] mechanisms\" for reporting harassing conduct).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following this logic, it is evident that when sexually charged innuendo contaminates a workplace and creates an abusive environment, Title VII is violated &#8212; and the violation constitutes an unlawful employment practice. <i>See Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs. Inc.,</i> 523 U.S. 75, 78, 118 S.Ct. 998, 140 L.Ed.2d 201 (1998) (citing 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-2(a)(1)). But there is a rub: the pressure to enforce Title VII is in obvious tension with the fundamental doctrine upon which employer liability under section 301 is premised &#8212; a doctrine that holds employers liable for misunderstandings between its investigators and accused employees. <i>See Malik,</i> 202 F.3d at 107 (explaining that \"if employers must fear... liability based on ex post findings, they will be deterred from taking reasonable corrective action ... as required by federal law\"). Easing that tension requires courts to erect a decisional framework that allows a certain amount of play in the joints. We pause briefly to explain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Congress gave private individuals a significant role in the enforcement process of Title VII.\" <i>Alexander,</i> 415 U.S. at 45, 94 S.Ct. 1011. It would be counterproductive for federal courts, in whom Congress has vested \"final responsibility for enforcement of Title VII,\" <i>id.</i> at 44, 94 S.Ct. 1011, to insist upon de novo review of actions taken by an employer to eradicate sexual harassment in the workplace. If federal courts are to give effect to the antiharassment policies encouraged by Title VII, they must defer, within wide limits, both to an employer's determination that sexual harassment has sullied the workplace and to its conception of an appropriate response. <i>Cf. Williams v. Maremont Corp.,</i> 875 F.2d 1476, 1485 (10th Cir.1989) (applying this rationale in wrongful discharge case based on state law). The law should not require an employer, charged with responsibilities under Title VII, to wait until it is sued and found liable in a gender discrimination case before it can take steps necessary to prevent or eliminate a hostile work environment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the degree of deference. Because the employer in such cases vindicates the important congressional policies against discriminatory employment practices, it fulfills a quasi-administrative function. <i>See Alexander,</i> 415 U.S. at 47, 94 S.Ct. 1011 (explaining that \"legislative enactments in this area have long evinced a general intent to accord parallel or overlapping remedies against discrimination\"). By analogy, then, a court should uphold the employer's actions so long as those actions are justified by substantial evidence. <i>Cf. Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB,</i> 340 U.S. 474, 488, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951) (elucidating \"substantial evidence\" standard); <i>Providence Hosp. v. NLRB,</i> 93 F.3d 1012, 1016 (1st Cir.1996) (same). We adopt this rule for hybrid section 301 actions that implicate Title VII concerns. Thus, when an employer discharges an employee in the exercise of its Title VII responsibilities, and the employee retorts by suing the employer and his union, we think that the vector of these competing forces requires the employee to demonstrate that the record is devoid of any substantial evidence supporting the discharge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>The Breach of Contract Claim.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With these precepts in mind, we proceed to the merits of the case. Mulvihill hypothesizes that Spalding discharged him without \"proper cause\" as that term is used in the CBA. We test this hypothesis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether the undisputed facts in a specific case establish &#8212; or fail to establish &#8212; proper cause for discharge within the contemplation of a given CBA is a question of law (and, thus, a question for the court). <i>Crider,</i> 130 F.3d at 1242. The concept of proper cause demands a close, albeit not exact, correlation between the employee's conduct and the employer's response. <i>Boston Med. Ctr. v. Serv. Employees Int'l Union,</i> 260 F.3d 16, 22 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the question of whether proper cause exists to sustain the employee's discharge intersects with the question of whether the record contains substantial evidence. After all, to find substantial evidence supporting the adverse employment action for Title VII purposes but not for purposes of a broadly worded management rights provision in the CBA would frustrate the legislative policies at stake. <i>See id.</i> at 23; <i>see also Williams,</i> 875 F.2d at 1485. It follows, therefore, that if Spalding's actions rested on substantial evidence, then Spalding acted with proper cause within the meaning of the CBA. Accordingly, we scrutinize the record to determine whether substantial evidence supported Spalding's conclusion that Mulvihill had engaged in sexually harassing conduct, warranting dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sexual harassment cases, \"the objective severity of harassment should be judged from the perspective of a reasonable person in the [employee]'s position considering all the circumstances.\" <i>Oncale,</i> 523 U.S. at 81, 118 S.Ct. 998 (internal quotation marks omitted). We caution, however, that Title VII was not meant to protect thin-skinned employees. The statutory scheme \"forbids only behavior so objectively offensive as to alter the conditions of the victim's employment. Conduct that is not severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment ... is beyond Title VII's purview.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted). By the same token, we caution that because the analysis requires an objective test, any subjectively benevolent or constructive intent on the part of the putative harasser will not justify a court in second-guessing the employer's decision. Rather, \"[c]ommon sense, and an appropriate sensitivity to social context\" must guide the analysis. <i>Id.</i> at 82, 118 S.Ct. 998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, substantial evidence in the summary judgment record shows that Spalding had proper cause to discharge Mulvihill. The social context in which Mulvihill's behavior occurred was an industrial workplace. Spalding had adopted an explicit sexual harassment policy, administered pursuant to Title VII and the counterpart state statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, &#167; 3A(b), and had warned its work force that it took that policy seriously. Common sense suggests that a reasonable person, aware of the policy, could not have justified discussing the involvement of two coworkers in an extra-marital affair with a third-party member of the work force who had no legitimate interest in the subject matter. More importantly, from an objective standpoint Mulvihill's comments altered the conditions of Charest's employment and unreasonably interfered with her work performance. Thus, substantial record evidence provides a firm foundation for Spalding's conclusion that Mulvihill's conduct violated the company's published sexual harassment policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This same evidence also validates Spalding's claim that the discharge was a reasonable response to Mulvihill's misconduct. Spalding's sexual harassment policy stated unequivocally that potential punishments for violations included dismissal. The record makes manifest that once Charest filed a formal complaint, Spalding assigned the matter to a senior officer (Bourdeau). Bourdeau promptly interviewed key witnesses to determine the veracity of the allegation that Mulvihill was telling tawdry tales. When Bourdeau afforded Mulvihill the opportunity to explain his behavior, Mulvihill did not disclaim the substance of the comments attributed to him by others. Instead, he insisted that he had acted appropriately because his discussion of the affair with Charest's husband related only to the truth of the situation (and, thus, the discussion could not constitute harassment). The tortured nature of this logic itself lends support to the employer's ultimate decision. It is bad enough when an employee acts in a sexually harassing manner; it is even worse when he cannot see the failings in his own conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on Bourdeau's investigation, Spalding deemed termination to be the appropriate remedy. As the record contains substantial support for a finding that Mulvihill's behavior constituted sexual harassment, we have no basis to secondguess the decision to fire him. <i>See Mesnick,</i> 950 F.2d at 825 (\"Courts may not sit as super personnel departments, assessing the merits ... of employers' nondiscriminatory business decisions.\"). By like token, we cannot disturb that decision under a proper application of the substantial evidence standard. <i>See Providence Hosp.,</i> 93 F.3d at 1016. Mulvihill's refusal to acknowledge the wrongfulness of his conduct gave Spalding all the more reason to discharge him because there could be no assurance that Mulvihill would cease his harassing activities. <i>See Malik,</i> 202 F.3d at 107 (reasoning that worst-case scenarios must govern review when employer cannot assume that harassing behavior is likely to stop).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This ends our inquiry into whether the record contains substantial evidentiary support sufficient to ground Mulvihill's discharge. We hold that it does. As explained above, this holding necessarily means that Spalding acted with proper cause within the purview of the CBA. <i>See Boston Med. Ctr.,</i> 260 F.3d at 23; <i>Williams,</i> 875 F.2d at 1485.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, Mulvihill resists the conclusion that Spalding had proper cause to discharge him under the terms of the CBA. To this end, he makes a litany of arguments. None has merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He starts with the strange proposition that, by embedding the \"proper cause\" standard in the CBA, Spalding had surrendered the right to determine the existence vel non of proper cause and left that determination to an arbitrator. Building on this shaky foundation, he argues that Spalding was contractually bound to submit the propriety of any proposed discharge to arbitration. This argument flies in the teeth of both federal labor law and the plain language of the CBA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[F]ederal labor law is chiefly designed to promote [ ] the formation of the collective agreement and the private settlement of disputes under it.\" <i>Int'l Union, UAW v. Hoosier Cardinal Corp.,</i> 383 U.S. 696, 702, 86 S.Ct. 1107, 16 L.Ed.2d 192 (1966). As a general matter, therefore, arbitration is preferred over litigation in resolving private labor disputes. <i>See generally United Steelworkers v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Navig. Co.,</i> 363 U.S. 574, 581-82, 80 S.Ct. 1347, 4 L.Ed.2d 1409 (1960) (discussing benefits of arbitration). But it is not arbitration per se that federal policy favors; rather, it is the settlement of disputes by the means mutually agreed upon by the parties themselves &#8212; whatever those means may be. <i>See McCreedy,</i> 809 F.2d at 1237. By enforcing the results of choices freely made by labor and management, acting in concert, federal law \"promote[s] a higher degree of responsibility upon the parties to such agreements, and... thereby promote[s] industrial peace.\" <i>Textile Workers Union v. Lincoln Mills,</i> 353 U.S. 448, 454, 77 S.Ct. 912, 1 L.Ed.2d 972 (1957).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the process to which the parties agreed for settling differences is embodied in Article 9 of the CBA. That article outlines a two-step procedure for resolving grievances. The first step sets various time limits for processing written grievances. The second step contemplates that \"[i]f the Company's [first-step] answer is unsatisfactory to the Union,\" then the grievance \"shall be submitted to arbitration.\" That clause further provides, however, that \"[i]f the Union has not submitted a request for arbitration with[in] thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the step one answer, the grievance shall be considered settled on the basis of [the employer's] answer.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no language in the CBA that guarantees individual employees that every grievance will be arbitrated. To the contrary, the grievance procedure leaves to the Union's sole discretion the decision as to whether to request arbitration. Such provisions are common fare in CBAs &#8212; and where they exist, courts typically cede the union considerable leeway in evaluating the merit associated with a particular grievance and the resources that it will expend to prosecute that grievance. <i>Miller v. United States Postal Serv.,</i> 985 F.2d 9, 12 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed against this backdrop, it is evident that Spalding and the Union reached a final settlement of Mulvihill's grievance when Spalding denied it and the Union elected not to pursue the matter further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> As between the parties to the CBA, that determination was \"valid, binding, and enforceable.\" <i>Textile Workers,</i> 353 U.S. at 454, 77 S.Ct. 912. Since Spalding surrendered authority to discharge for proper cause only to the extent specified in the CBA, Mulvihill's argument that he had an absolute right to arbitration will not wash.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mulvihill next asseverates that deferring to the results of Spalding's investigation violates the summary judgment standard and, in the bargain, denigrates the importance of employee rights under collective bargaining agreements. This asseveration lacks force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have explained, Mulvihill bears the burden of demonstrating that Spalding discharged him in derogation of the CBA. <i>Hines,</i> 424 U.S. at 570. Because he has failed to do so, we are bound to honor the final settlement reached by the parties under the terms of the CBA. <i>See E. Associated Coal Corp. v. United Mine Workers,</i> 531 U.S. 57, 62, 121 S.Ct. 462, 148 L.Ed.2d 354 (2000); <i>Boston Med. Ctr.,</i> 260 F.3d at 21. In this context, we are not deferring to Spalding's determination that proper cause existed, but, rather, to the outcome of the grievance procedure described in the CBA. <i>See DelCostello,</i> 462 U.S. at 164, 103 S.Ct. 2281 (\"Subject to very limited judicial review, [parties to a CBA] will be bound by the result according to the finality provisions of the agreement.\"). The federal policy of settling labor disputes by privately arranged procedures would be compromised if courts had the final say on the merits of every settlement. <i>See El Dorado Tech. Servs., Inc. v. Union Gen. De Trabajadores,</i> 961 F.2d 317, 319 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a related vein, Mulvihill contends that several factual issues surrounding Spalding's investigation preclude summary judgment. None of his prolix argumentation exposes any material fact sufficient to derail the summary judgment train.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Mulvihill posits that a reasonable juror could find that his conduct was that of a concerned employee hoping to diffuse a potentially explosive situation, not that of a sexual harasser. This thesis runs along the following lines. Mulvihill says that it is reasonable to infer that Spalding acted without proper cause because a more thorough investigation would have revealed the following facts. (1) While Todd Charest was at Mulvihill's home to estimate the costs of a needed roof repair, he inquired whether Mulvihill had heard any rumors that his wife was involved in a sexual liaison with Mike Rattell. (2) Mulvihill replied that he had heard \"shop talk\" about such a tryst. (3) When Todd Charest asked for Melissa Rattell's telephone number, Mulvihill told him that he did not have it but that he would give Todd's number to Melissa so that she could contact him if she so chose. (4) Mulvihill then gave Melissa Rattell the telephone number and told her of his conversation with Todd Charest. (5) He then recounted these conversations to his supervisor, Montessi, believing that the situation could have detrimental effects for the working environment. (6) According to Mulvihill, Montessi wanted nothing to do with the matter and walked away. (7) Later the same day, Perreault noticed that Amy Charest was not at work and expressed concern about her increased absenteeism and substandard job performance. (8) When Perreault asked Mulvihill if he knew of anything that might be affecting her work, Mulvihill told Perreault of his conversations with Todd Charest and Melissa Rattell.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the record supports this chain of sanguine inferences &#8212; a matter on which we take no view &#8212; Mulvihill's analysis is misguided. The question here is not whether Amy Charest and Mike Rattell were actually engaged in an extra-marital affair. Nor is the question whether Mulvihill's actions were well-intentioned. The fact is that Spalding, after due investigation, reasonably concluded that Mulvihill's remarks about the alleged affair, regardless of either their accuracy or their purpose, unnecessarily created a hostile work environment for Amy Charest (and, thus, violated Spalding's published sexual harassment policy). This reasonable conclusion constituted proper cause for Spalding to discharge Mulvihill. Seen in this light, Mulvihill's inferential chain, even if credited, would not alter any <i>material</i> fact. <i>See Morris,</i> 27 F.3d at 748 (explaining that a fact, to be material, must have the capacity to affect the outcome of the suit); <i>see also Malik,</i> 202 F.3d at 107.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next factual dispute to which Mulvihill alludes involves the extent of Spalding's investigation. In this regard, he draws our attention to the statement in Spalding's sexual harassment policy that \"no disciplinary action will be taken without a thorough investigation of the facts which shall include gathering of statements from all parties and witnesses involved in the matter.\" From this launching pad, he jumps to the conclusion that Spalding's investigation was not conducted in good faith (or, at least, that a jury could so find) because Bourdeau neglected to interview three potential witnesses. This suggestion cannot withstand scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The persons that Bourdeau decided not to interview were Mike Rattell, Melissa Rattell, and Todd Charest. Mulvihill's attack overlooks that Bourdeau reasonably concluded that he did not need to talk to these individuals because the issue was not whether a meretricious relationship existed, but, rather, whether Mulvihill was conversing with his coworkers about Amy Charest's sex life. There is no evidence in the record that suggests that the three named individuals had any personal knowledge as to whether Mulvihill engaged in gossip-mongering. Thus, the decision not to interview them was well within the employer's broad discretion. A fortiori, that decision was insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact anent Spalding's good faith.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See Williams,</i> 875 F.2d at 1485.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mulvihill also maintains that there are factual issues regarding the validity of the accusations against him. This is true as far as it goes &#8212; but it does not go very far. The investigation reveals that all of the witnesses agreed that Mulvihill had commented in the most crude and offensive terms about a sexual liaison between Amy Charest and Mike Rattell. Although Mulvihill admits his role in the discussions, he denies that he used uncouth language. That asserted factual dispute has no bearing on our analysis. There is no evidence that Charest herself was exposed to Mulvihill's comments at first hand and, in all events, the violation that sparked Mulvihill's ouster did not depend on the phraseology that he used. Whether Mulvihill spoke to his coworkers with the saltiness of a sailor or the eloquence of a Shakespearean scholar, it was the essence of his statements that created the hostile work environment. The linguistic trappings were, at most, the icing on the cake. Hence, Mulvihill again fails to limn a material dispute sufficient to block summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Mulvihill asserts that Spalding's sexual harassment policy only prohibited \"spreading false rumors.\" To bolster this argument, he points to a company manual describing \"on the job conduct,\" which specifically cites the spreading of false rumors as violative of \"proper standards of conduct.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is hopeless. For one thing, the record is devoid of any evidence that Spalding ever limited its sexual harassment policy to conform to this description. For another thing, the fact that Mulvihill's salacious statements may have been true &#8212; a matter that we need not decide &#8212; would not alter the fact that his dissemination of them to Charest's coworkers violated the company's sexual harassment policy and fomented a hostile work environment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Mulvihill's asseverational array contains a smattering of other arguments, none warrants discussion. We conclude, therefore, that Spalding had proper cause for cashiering Mulvihill and that, under the CBA, it bears no liability for wrongful discharge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">D. <i>The Fair Representation Claim.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion that Spalding did not breach the CBA when it terminated Mulvihill's employment serves to dispose of his case against the Union as well. To prevail against either defendant in a hybrid section 301 action, a plaintiff must show that the employer discharged him in derogation of the CBA. <i>DelCostello,</i> 462 U.S. at 165, 103 S.Ct. 2281. Because we have determined that Mulvihill failed to carry this burden, <i>see supra</i> Part II(C), his suit against the Union necessarily fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">E. <i>The Defamation Claim.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mulvihill's complaint also contained a claim that Spalding, by labeling him as a sexual harasser, defamed him. The district court entered summary judgment against him on this claim, and Mulvihill appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This aspect of the case need not occupy us for long. \"We have steadfastly deemed waived issues raised on appeal in a perfunctory manner, not accompanied by developed argumentation.\" <i>United States v. Bongiorno,</i> 106 F.3d 1027, 1034 (1st Cir.1997). An issue falls into this category when, for example, the proponent mentions it as \"a possible argument in the most skeletal way, leaving the court to do counsel's work.\" <i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990). So it is here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After citing to his own self-serving testimony to the effect that some of his associates told him that they had heard he was fired for sexual harassment, Mulvihill makes the general assertion that the \"record before the court contains an abundance of evidence which a jury could credit showing this charge to be false, and that defendant Spalding knew that Mulvihill did not sexually harass anyone.\" Appellant's Br. at 45. That is the beginning and the end of his argument vis-&#224;-vis the defamation count. He makes no attempt either to marshal the pertinent facts or to engage in reasoned analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This treatment is too perfunctory to preserve the issue for appeal. Mulvihill has done no more than point in a desultory manner to a welter of paper &#8212; the record appendix comprises almost 1,400 pages &#8212; without \"array[ing] these plethoric evidentiary materials in any systematic way\" with respect to his putative cause of action. <i>Mass. Sch. of Law at Andover, Inc. v. Am. Bar Ass'n,</i> 142 F.3d 26, 43 (1st Cir.1998). That amounts to an invitation that we ransack the record, research the law, and make his argument for him. We decline the invitation. <i>See Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d at 17. Consequently, we deem the argument waived.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. While courts should give broad latitude to employers in investigating charges of sexual harassment in the workplace, the federal interest in eradicating sexual harassment must nonetheless be balanced against the equally strong federal interest in protecting inadequately represented union employees from wrongful discharge. To achieve this balance, the law allows an employee who is fired for sexual harassment to prevail in an ensuing hybrid section 301 action only if he can show that the employer lacked a substantial evidentiary basis for its determination that he was guilty of sexual harassment. Mulvihill has failed by a wide margin to make this showing. He also has failed to make out a prima facie case of defamation. Accordingly, we affirm the entry of summary judgment in the defendants' favor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> By virtue of certain corporate transactions not relevant here, Spalding is now known as The Top-Flite Golf Company</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Such deference to factual determinations and interpretations of private contract disputes is consistent with federal labor law when issues of well-defined and dominant public policy are at stake<i>See E.

(Spalding) had terminated his employment without proper cause,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> plaintiff-appellant Martin J. Mulvihill asked his union &#8212; Local 1851 of the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers and Helpers (the Union) &#8212; to prosecute a grievance against Spalding pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement then in effect (the CBA). The Union did so. But when Spalding rejected the grievance, the Union refused to bring the matter to arbitration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mulvihill subsequently brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against Spalding and the Union. In due course, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of both defendants. Mulvihill appeals.

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We present the facts derived from the record in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment (here, the plaintiff). <i>See Plumley v. S. Container, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200125\"><a href=\"/opinion/200125/plumley-v-southern-container/\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">364</span></a></span>, 367 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mulvihill began his tour of duty at Spalding in 1969. At the times material hereto, a CBA was in effect between Spalding and the Union. The CBA included a management rights provision, which stated, inter alia, that Spalding would \"continue to direct working forces, including the right to ... discharge [employees] for proper cause.\" The CBA also mapped out a standard grievance mechanism. Under it, an offended employee could lodge a grievance with a Union-organized committee and expect the grievance committee to press Spalding to resolve the complaint. If that failed, the Union had the right to compel Spalding to proceed to binding arbitration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mulvihill, a long-time Union member, held a job within the bargaining unit. In 2000, a coworker, Amy Charest, accused him of sexual harassment. Acting on Charest's formal complaint, Spalding conducted an investigation. The results of that probe led it to terminate Mulvihill's employment. Contending that Spalding had discharged him without proper cause, Mulvihill submitted a grievance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Buoyed by Mulvihill's thirty-two years of service, the Union's grievance committee lobbied Spalding to reconsider its decision, reinstate Mulvihill, and award him back pay. The main thrust of the Union's argument was that discharge was \"too serious\" a remedy for the asserted misconduct. Spalding rejected the Union's importunings, pointing to Charest's complaint and the results of its investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In her complaint, Charest had accused Mulvihill of: spreading \"false rumors\" within the company to the effect that she was \"having an affair\" with a fellow employee named Mike Rattell; telling Rattell's wife &#8212; who also worked for Spalding &#8212; about the alleged affair; \"interfering with [Charest's] personal life\" and making her feel \"violated\"; and creating a situation in which Charest found it \"emotionally and physically ... hard [to] concentrat[e] on [her] work.\" Spalding's investigation into these remonstrances revealed the following undisputed facts. On September 7, 2000, Charest's husband, Todd, had gone to Mulvihill's home on matters unrelated to this dispute. The two discussed Charest's putative involvement in a sexual relationship with Rattell and Mulvihill agreed to give Todd Charest's telephone number to Rattell's wife (Melissa) so that she could contact him regarding their spouses' suspected infidelity. Mulvihill passed the telephone number to Melissa Rattell at work the following day. He proceeded to tell two other Spalding employees (Domenic Montessi and Ray Perreault) about the alleged affair. According to them, he supplied graphic detail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Spalding's sexual harassment policy prohibits \"sexual discrimination or harassment which undermines the employment relationship by creating an intimidating, hostile, and offensive work environment.\" The policy specifically defines verbal harassment to include \"spreading rumors about a coworker's sex life\" and forbids any such conduct that may \"unreasonably interfere[ ] with an employee's work performance.\" The executive in charge of the investigation, Robert Bourdeau, concluded that Mulvihill's behavior transgressed the policy and created a working environment that Charest reasonably found offensive. After consulting with senior management, Bourdeau terminated Mulvihill's employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As said, the Union initially processed a grievance on Mulvihill's behalf. When Spalding resisted, the Union accepted Spalding's response, ignored Mulvihill's protests, and allowed the matter to die on the vine. After the deadline for submitting the grievance to arbitration had passed, Mulvihill filed suit against Spalding and the Union. His complaint asserted, inter alia, that (1) Spalding had violated section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 185, by cashiering him without proper cause (in derogation of the CBA), and (2) the Union had failed to heed its duty fairly to represent him with respect to Spalding's breach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This sort of double-barreled suit is known as a hybrid section 301 action. <i>See, e.g., Arriaga-Zayas v. Int'l Ladies' Garment Workers' Union,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"498436\"><a href=\"/opinion/498436/norma-arriaga-zayas-v-international-ladies-garment-workers-union-puerto/\"><span class=\"volume\">835</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 12 (1st Cir.1987). While it is composed of two causes of action &#8212; one against the employer and the other against the union &#8212; the claims are inextricably intertwined. <i>See DelCostello v. Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110956\"><a href=\"/opinion/110956/delcostello-v-teamsters/\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">151</span></a></span>, 164-65, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110956\"><a href=\"/opinion/110956/delcostello-v-teamsters/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">476</span></a></span> (1983). This imbrication is underscored by the fact that in order to prevail against either defendant, the employee must establish that the employer breached the CBA. <i>Id.</i> at 165, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110956\"><a href=\"/opinion/110956/delcostello-v-teamsters/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

On this basis, the court disposed of the section 301 claims. Mulvihill also had asserted a defamation claim, and the court found that claim wanting as well. This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin our analysis with a reiteration of the by-now-familiar summary judgment standard. We then provide an overview of the interaction between hybrid section 301 actions and Title VII. Finally, we turn to the merits of Mulvihill's claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>The Summary Judgment Standard.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The role of summary judgment is to look behind the facade erected by the pleadings and assay the parties' proof in order to determine whether a trial will serve any useful purpose. <i>Plumley,</i> 303 F.3d at 368. Conventional summary judgment practice requires the moving party to assert the absence of a genuine issue of material fact and then support that assertion by affidavits, admissions, or other materials of evidentiary quality. <i>Quintero de Quintero v. Aponte-Roque,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"590214\"><a href=\"/opinion/590214/dinhora-quintero-de-quintero-v-awilda-aponte-roque/\"><span class=\"volume\">974</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">226</span></a></span>, 227-28 (1st Cir.1992). Once the movant has done its part, the burden shifts to the summary judgment target to demonstrate that a trialworthy issue exists. <i>Suarez v. Pueblo Int'l, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770706\"><a href=\"/opinion/770706/ramon-m-suarez-v-pueblo-international-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span>, 53 (1st Cir.2000). When all is said and done, summary judgment will lie only if the \"pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In conducting this tamisage, the district court must scrutinize the record in the light most flattering to the party opposing the motion, indulging all reasonable inferences in that party's favor. <i>Morris v. Gov't Dev. Bank,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195462\"><a href=\"/opinion/195462/morris-andino-v-development-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">746</span></a></span>, 748 (1st Cir.1994). This standard is notoriously liberal &#8212; but its liberality does not relieve the nonmovant of the burden of producing specific facts sufficient to deflect the swing of the summary judgment scythe. <i>Id.</i> Moreover, the factual conflicts relied upon by the nonmovant must be both genuine and material. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). For this purpose, \"genuine\" means that the evidence is such that a reasonable factfinder could resolve the point in favor of the nonmoving party, and \"material\" means that the fact is one that might affect the outcome of the suit under the applicable law. <i>Morris,</i> 27 F.3d at 748.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This same paradigm governs our de novo review of a district court's summary judgment rulings. <i>Plumley,</i> 303 F.3d at 369. There is, however, one important distinction. The court of appeals \"is not restricted to the district court's reasoning but can affirm a summary judgment on any independently sufficient ground\" made manifest in the record. <i>Mesnick v. Gen. Elec. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573068\"><a href=\"/opinion/573068/samuel-mesnick-v-general-electric-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">816</span></a></span>, 822 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The Governing Law.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal common law supplies the substantive rules for adjudicating interlocked claims against an employer and a trade union for breach of a CBA. <i>See Crider v.

New Engl. Power Serv.,</i> 239 F.3d 8,14 (1st Cir.2001) (\"In creating &#167; 301 of the LMRA, Congress intended that a comprehensive, unified, body of federal law should govern actions concerning the interpretation and enforcement of collective bargaining agreements.\") (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the CBA allowed Spalding to take certain personnel actions (including dismissal) for \"proper cause.\" Spalding concluded that it had such cause and fired Mulvihill. The Union refrained from testing that conclusion through arbitration. In run-of-the-mine actions, the finality provisions of the CBA would operate to preclude judicial review of such a determination. <i>See Abernathy v. United States Postal Serv.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"439285\"><a href=\"/opinion/439285/james-abernathy-v-united-states-postal-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">740</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">612</span></a></span>, 617 (8th Cir.1984). But hybrid section 301 cases are fundamentally different. Because a hybrid section 301 action, by definition, involves a claim of inadequate union representation, the employer's determination can be overcome if the claimant can show, inter alia, that the adverse employment action contravened the CBA. <i>Hines v. Anchor Motor Freight, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109392\"><a href=\"/opinion/109392/hines-v-anchor-motor-freight-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">554</span></a></span>, 567, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109392\"><a href=\"/opinion/109392/hines-v-anchor-motor-freight-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Typically, claimants attempting to make the requisite showing in hybrid section 301 actions must carry a heavy burden. Such claimants \"are not entitled to relitigate their discharge[s] merely because they offer newly discovered evidence that the charges against them were false and that they in fact were fired without [sufficient] cause.\" <i>Hines,</i> 424 U.S. at 571, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109392\"><a href=\"/opinion/109392/hines-v-anchor-motor-freight-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1048</span></a></span>. Rather, such a case may proceed only if, and to the extent that, the claimant can show that the checks and balances built into the CBA's internal dispute resolution process have failed to function. <i>See McCreedy v.

To reach this safe harbor, the claimant must prove an erroneous discharge, a breach of duty on the union's part, and a causal nexus between the two, that is, \"that [the] union's breach of its duty `seriously undermine[d] the integrity of the [grievance] process.'\" <i>United Parcel Serv., Inc. v.

It does, however, require the claimant to produce sufficient evidence from which a reasonable factfinder can conclude not only that the discharge was improper but also that the union's breach undermined the grievance process and thereby contributed to the error. <i>See Thomas v.

It involves an assessment of the actions of Spalding and the Union against the background understanding of \"proper cause\" as that term is used in the CBA. The matter is complicated, however, because the principal allegation against Mulvihill &#8212; the charge of sexual harassment &#8212; implicates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2000e to 2000e-17. Employee-claimants in hybrid section 301 actions that impinge upon an employer's responsibilities under Title VII must carry an especially heavy burden. That is so because the presence of Title VII transforms the case from a relatively simple two-variable equation that aspires to strike a suitable balance between an employee's rights and an employer's hegemony into a more complex three-variable analysis in which that balance must be struck while simultaneously ensuring that important federal anti-discrimination policies are honored. <i>See Malik v.

But there is a rub: the pressure to enforce Title VII is in obvious tension with the fundamental doctrine upon which employer liability under section 301 is premised &#8212; a doctrine that holds employers liable for misunderstandings between its investigators and accused employees. <i>See Malik,</i> 202 F.3d at 107 (explaining that \"if employers must fear... liability based on ex post findings, they will be deterred from taking reasonable corrective action ... as required by federal law\").

If federal courts are to give effect to the antiharassment policies encouraged by Title VII, they must defer, within wide limits, both to an employer's determination that sexual harassment has sullied the workplace and to its conception of an appropriate response. <i>Cf.

We adopt this rule for hybrid section 301 actions that implicate Title VII concerns. Thus, when an employer discharges an employee in the exercise of its Title VII responsibilities, and the employee retorts by suing the employer and his union, we think that the vector of these competing forces requires the employee to demonstrate that the record is devoid of any substantial evidence supporting the discharge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>The Breach of Contract Claim.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With these precepts in mind, we proceed to the merits of the case.

It follows, therefore, that if Spalding's actions rested on substantial evidence, then Spalding acted with proper cause within the meaning of the CBA.

The social context in which Mulvihill's behavior occurred was an industrial workplace. Spalding had adopted an explicit sexual harassment policy, administered pursuant to Title VII and the counterpart state statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, &#167; 3A(b), and had warned its work force that it took that policy seriously. Common sense suggests that a reasonable person, aware of the policy, could not have justified discussing the involvement of two coworkers in an extra-marital affair with a third-party member of the work force who had no legitimate interest in the subject matter. More importantly, from an objective standpoint Mulvihill's comments altered the conditions of Charest's employment and unreasonably interfered with her work performance. Thus, substantial record evidence provides a firm foundation for Spalding's conclusion that Mulvihill's conduct violated the company's published sexual harassment policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This same evidence also validates Spalding's claim that the discharge was a reasonable response to Mulvihill's misconduct. Spalding's sexual harassment policy stated unequivocally that potential punishments for violations included dismissal. The record makes manifest that once Charest filed a formal complaint, Spalding assigned the matter to a senior officer (Bourdeau). Bourdeau promptly interviewed key witnesses to determine the veracity of the allegation that Mulvihill was telling tawdry tales. When Bourdeau afforded Mulvihill the opportunity to explain his behavior, Mulvihill did not disclaim the substance of the comments attributed to him by others. Instead, he insisted that he had acted appropriately because his discussion of the affair with Charest's husband related only to the truth of the situation (and, thus, the discussion could not constitute harassment). The tortured nature of this logic itself lends support to the employer's ultimate decision. It is bad enough when an employee acts in a sexually harassing manner; it is even worse when he cannot see the failings in his own conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on Bourdeau's investigation, Spalding deemed termination to be the appropriate remedy. As the record contains substantial support for a finding that Mulvihill's behavior constituted sexual harassment, we have no basis to secondguess the decision to fire him. <i>See Mesnick,</i> 950 F.2d at 825 (\"Courts may not sit as super personnel departments, assessing the merits ... of employers' nondiscriminatory business decisions.\"). By like token, we cannot disturb that decision under a proper application of the substantial evidence standard. <i>See Providence Hosp.,</i> 93 F.3d at 1016. Mulvihill's refusal to acknowledge the wrongfulness of his conduct gave Spalding all the more reason to discharge him because there could be no assurance that Mulvihill would cease his harassing activities. <i>See Malik,</i> 202 F.3d at 107 (reasoning that worst-case scenarios must govern review when employer cannot assume that harassing behavior is likely to stop).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This ends our inquiry into whether the record contains substantial evidentiary support sufficient to ground Mulvihill's discharge. We hold that it does. As explained above, this holding necessarily means that Spalding acted with proper cause within the purview of the CBA. <i>See Boston Med. Ctr.,</i> 260 F.3d at 23; <i>Williams,</i> 875 F.2d at 1485.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, Mulvihill resists the conclusion that Spalding had proper cause to discharge him under the terms of the CBA.

This thesis runs along the following lines. Mulvihill says that it is reasonable to infer that Spalding acted without proper cause because a more thorough investigation would have revealed the following facts. (1) While Todd Charest was at Mulvihill's home to estimate the costs of a needed roof repair, he inquired whether Mulvihill had heard any rumors that his wife was involved in a sexual liaison with Mike Rattell. (2) Mulvihill replied that he had heard \"shop talk\" about such a tryst. (3) When Todd Charest asked for Melissa Rattell's telephone number, Mulvihill told him that he did not have it but that he would give Todd's number to Melissa so that she could contact him if she so chose. (4) Mulvihill then gave Melissa Rattell the telephone number and told her of his conversation with Todd Charest. (5) He then recounted these conversations to his supervisor, Montessi, believing that the situation could have detrimental effects for the working environment. (6) According to Mulvihill, Montessi wanted nothing to do with the matter and walked away. (7) Later the same day, Perreault noticed that Amy Charest was not at work and expressed concern about her increased absenteeism and substandard job performance. (8) When Perreault asked Mulvihill if he knew of anything that might be affecting her work, Mulvihill told Perreault of his conversations with Todd Charest and Melissa Rattell.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the record supports this chain of sanguine inferences &#8212; a matter on which we take no view &#8212; Mulvihill's analysis is misguided. The question here is not whether Amy Charest and Mike Rattell were actually engaged in an extra-marital affair. Nor is the question whether Mulvihill's actions were well-intentioned. The fact is that Spalding, after due investigation, reasonably concluded that Mulvihill's remarks about the alleged affair, regardless of either their accuracy or their purpose, unnecessarily created a hostile work environment for Amy Charest (and, thus, violated Spalding's published sexual harassment policy). This reasonable conclusion constituted proper cause for Spalding to discharge Mulvihill. Seen in this light, Mulvihill's inferential chain, even if credited, would not alter any <i>material</i> fact. <i>See Morris,</i> 27 F.3d at 748 (explaining that a fact, to be material, must have the capacity to affect the outcome of the suit); <i>see also Malik,</i> 202 F.3d at 107.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next factual dispute to which Mulvihill alludes involves the extent of Spalding's investigation. In this regard, he draws our attention to the statement in Spalding's sexual harassment policy that \"no disciplinary action will be taken without a thorough investigation of the facts which shall include gathering of statements from all parties and witnesses involved in the matter.\" From this launching pad, he jumps to the conclusion that Spalding's investigation was not conducted in good faith (or, at least, that a jury could so find) because Bourdeau neglected to interview three potential witnesses. This suggestion cannot withstand scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The persons that Bourdeau decided not to interview were Mike Rattell, Melissa Rattell, and Todd Charest. Mulvihill's attack overlooks that Bourdeau reasonably concluded that he did not need to talk to these individuals because the issue was not whether a meretricious relationship existed, but, rather, whether Mulvihill was conversing with his coworkers about Amy Charest's sex life. There is no evidence in the record that suggests that the three named individuals had any personal knowledge as to whether Mulvihill engaged in gossip-mongering. Thus, the decision not to interview them was well within the employer's broad discretion. A fortiori, that decision was insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact anent Spalding's good faith.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See Williams,</i> 875 F.2d at 1485.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mulvihill also maintains that there are factual issues regarding the validity of the accusations against him. This is true as far as it goes &#8212; but it does not go very far. The investigation reveals that all of the witnesses agreed that Mulvihill had commented in the most crude and offensive terms about a sexual liaison between Amy Charest and Mike Rattell. Although Mulvihill admits his role in the discussions, he denies that he used uncouth language. That asserted factual dispute has no bearing on our analysis. There is no evidence that Charest herself was exposed to Mulvihill's comments at first hand and, in all events, the violation that sparked Mulvihill's ouster did not depend on the phraseology that he used. Whether Mulvihill spoke to his coworkers with the saltiness of a sailor or the eloquence of a Shakespearean scholar, it was the essence of his statements that created the hostile work environment. The linguistic trappings were, at most, the icing on the cake. Hence, Mulvihill again fails to limn a material dispute sufficient to block summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Mulvihill asserts that Spalding's sexual harassment policy only prohibited \"spreading false rumors.\" To bolster this argument, he points to a company manual describing \"on the job conduct,\" which specifically cites the spreading of false rumors as violative of \"proper standards of conduct.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is hopeless. For one thing, the record is devoid of any evidence that Spalding ever limited its sexual harassment policy to conform to this description. For another thing, the fact that Mulvihill's salacious statements may have been true &#8212; a matter that we need not decide &#8212; would not alter the fact that his dissemination of them to Charest's coworkers violated the company's sexual harassment policy and fomented a hostile work environment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Mulvihill's asseverational array contains a smattering of other arguments, none warrants discussion. We conclude, therefore, that Spalding had proper cause for cashiering Mulvihill and that, under the CBA, it bears no liability for wrongful discharge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">D. <i>The Fair Representation Claim.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion that Spalding did not breach the CBA when it terminated Mulvihill's employment serves to dispose of his case against the Union as well. To prevail against either defendant in a hybrid section 301 action, a plaintiff must show that the employer discharged him in derogation of the CBA. <i>DelCostello,</i> 462 U.S. at 165, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110956\"><a href=\"/opinion/110956/delcostello-v-teamsters/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2281</span></a></span>. Because we have determined that Mulvihill failed to carry this burden, <i>see supra</i> Part II(C), his suit against the Union necessarily fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">E. <i>The Defamation Claim.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mulvihill's complaint also contained a claim that Spalding, by labeling him as a sexual harasser, defamed him. The district court entered summary judgment against him on this claim, and Mulvihill appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This aspect of the case need not occupy us for long. \"We have steadfastly deemed waived issues raised on appeal in a perfunctory manner, not accompanied by developed argumentation.\" <i>United States v. Bongiorno,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"735399\"><a href=\"/opinion/735399/united-states-v-frank-p-bongiorno-united-states-of-america-v-frank-p/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1027</span></a></span>, 1034 (1st Cir.1997). An issue falls into this category when, for example, the proponent mentions it as \"a possible argument in the most skeletal way, leaving the court to do counsel's work.\" <i>United States v. Zannino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1990). So it is here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After citing to his own self-serving testimony to the effect that some of his associates told him that they had heard he was fired for sexual harassment, Mulvihill makes the general assertion that the \"record before the court contains an abundance of evidence which a jury could credit showing this charge to be false, and that defendant Spalding knew that Mulvihill did not sexually harass anyone.\" Appellant's Br. at 45. That is the beginning and the end of his argument vis-&#224;-vis the defamation count. He makes no attempt either to marshal the pertinent facts or to engage in reasoned analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This treatment is too perfunctory to preserve the issue for appeal. Mulvihill has done no more than point in a desultory manner to a welter of paper &#8212; the record appendix comprises almost 1,400 pages &#8212; without \"array[ing] these plethoric evidentiary materials in any systematic way\" with respect to his putative cause of action. <i>Mass. Sch. of Law at Andover, Inc. v. Am. Bar Ass'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197918\"><a href=\"/opinion/197918/massachusetts-school-v-american-bar/\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 43 (1st Cir.1998). That amounts to an invitation that we ransack the record, research the law, and make his argument for him. We decline the invitation. <i>See Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d at 17. Consequently, we deem the argument waived.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. While courts should give broad latitude to employers in investigating charges of sexual harassment in the workplace, the federal interest in eradicating sexual harassment must nonetheless be balanced against the equally strong federal interest in protecting inadequately represented union employees from wrongful discharge. To achieve this balance, the law allows an employee who is fired for sexual harassment to prevail in an ensuing hybrid section 301 action only if he can show that the employer lacked a substantial evidentiary basis for its determination that he was guilty of sexual harassment. Mulvihill has failed by a wide margin to make this showing. He also has failed to make out a prima facie case of defamation. Accordingly, we affirm the entry of summary judgment in the defendants' favor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> By virtue of certain corporate transactions not relevant here, Spalding is now known as The Top-Flite Golf Company</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Such deference to factual determinations and interpretations of private contract disputes is consistent with federal labor law when issues of well-defined and dominant public policy are at stake<i>See E.
