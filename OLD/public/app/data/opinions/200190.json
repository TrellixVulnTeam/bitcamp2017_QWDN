Richard G. Stearns, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                     Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n\n              Campbell and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Andrew D.

Douglas M. Bruce appeals from\n\na district court judgment which directed the tabloid Weekly World\n\nNews    (\"World   News\")    to     pay   him   $20,142.45    in    damages   and\n\nnonduplicative      profits       due    to    its   acknowledged     copyright\n\ninfringement.      Bruce insists that he is entitled to additional\n\ndamages amounting to between $359,000 and $406,000.                With but one\n\nexception, the district court judgment is affirmed.\n\n                                         I\n\n                                   BACKGROUND\n\n           In     March    1992,     Bruce,     a    freelance    photographer,\n\nphotographed then-presidential-candidate William S. Clinton as he\n\nwas shaking hands with an unidentified Secret Service agent.\n\nLater, Bruce consigned the photograph to The Picture Group, a photo\n\nstock agency.     Thereafter, a World News photo editor contacted The\n\nPicture Group to obtain a photograph of Clinton while shaking\n\nhands.     World News intended to alter any such photograph by\n\nsuperimposing, over the image of the person shaking Clinton's hand,\n\nits own image of the \"Space Alien.\"                  The \"Space Alien\" is a\n\nfictional extra-terrestrial creature which World News had been\n\nfeaturing prominently in its political campaign coverage ever since\n\n1990.     World    News    then    proceeded    to   manipulate    the   Clinton\n\nphotograph without first obtaining authorization from Bruce.                 The\n\nPicture Group and World News were unable to reach agreement on an\n\nappropriate licensing fee.\n\n\n                                         2\n\f              On the cover of its August 11, 1992 issue, World News\n\npublished the retouched photograph, together with the banner \"Alien\n\nBacks Clinton!\"         The Picture Group billed World News for $500,\n\nwhich    it    shared    equally       with     Bruce   pursuant   to     contract.\n\nThereafter, on each occasion that the retouched photograph appeared\n\nin    World   News,     The    Picture      Group   sent   World   News    a   bill.\n\nUltimately, Bruce realized a total of $1,775 in licensing fees.\n\nThe Picture Group ceased its business operations in 1993.\n\n              Thereafter, in 1994, Bruce came upon a World News T-shirt\n\nadvertisement utilizing the August 11, 1992 cover containing his\n\nretouched photograph.           In due course, Bruce's counsel transmitted\n\na    cease-and-desist         letter   to   World   News,   claiming      copyright\n\ninfringement.      World News responded with an offer to pay $500 for\n\na general release of the Bruce copyright.                   The same retouched\n\nphotograph later appeared on a different T-shirt featuring World\n\nNews' June 7, 1994 cover, containing photographs of twelve United\n\nStates Senators, under the banner \"12 U.S. Senators Are Space\n\nAliens!\"      These T-shirt advertisements subsequently were repeated\n\n188 times in World News, as well as numerous times on the World\n\nNews Internet site.           During this period, World News ordered 5,710\n\n(and sold 1,817) of the \"Alien Backs Clinton\" T-shirts and ordered\n\n4,767 (and sold 2,207) of the \"Senators Are Aliens\" T-shirts.\n\n              In an article entitled “Alien Endorses Dole,” appearing\n\nin the May 1996 issue, the World News cover included (1) another\n\n\n                                            3\n\fphotograph of Clinton (not taken by Bruce) holding a copy of the\n\nAugust   11,   1992   issue    of    World   News,   together          with   Bruce’s\n\nretouched photograph; as well as (2) the cover of the August 11,\n\n1992 issue, among a collage of earlier World News covers.                     In the\n\nMay 2000 issue, the retouched photograph appeared both as a small\n\ninset on the cover, which prominently featured a photograph of\n\nGeorge Bush shaking hands with the Space Alien, and adjacent to the\n\nrelated news story inside.           In addition, beginning in July 1995,\n\nthe August 11, 1992 World News cover, containing Bruce’s retouched\n\nphotograph,    appeared       48    times    as   part    of   a       subscription\n\nadvertisement placed inside the tabloid.\n\n           In June 1998, Bruce commenced the present action against\n\nWorld News for copyright infringement.            See 17 U.S.C. § 101 et seq.\n\n(1996 & Supp. 2002).      Following a bench trial, during which World\n\nNews acknowledged its infringements, the district court awarded\n\nBruce $20,142.45 in damages, plus interest.              Bruce v. Weekly World\n\nNews, Inc., 150 F. Supp. 2d 313 (D. Mass. 2001).1                       The damages\n\naward included nine components:\n\n\n     Actual Damages\n\n           Editorial use of retouched photo\n                on 5/28/96                               $     300\n           Additional editorial uses on\n                5/28/96 and 5/9/00                       $         0\n\n\n     1\n      The copyright statute itself delimits the recoverable damages\nin the instant case to those sustained since June 1, 1995. See 17\nU.S.C. § 507(b).\n\n                                        4\n\f            Uses on two promotional T-shirts   $    800\n            Uses in T-shirt ads                $      0\n            Uses in subscription ads           $      0\n            Uses on Internet site              $ 1,200\n            ___________________________________________\n            Subtotal                           $ 2,300\n            Multiplier for unauthorized use    x      5\n            ___________________________________________________\n            Subtotal of actual damages              $ 11,500.00\n\n\n      Nonduplicative Profits\n\n            Sales of T-shirts                  $   8,642.45\n            Advertising revenues               $       0\n            Newstand/subscription sales        $       0\n            ------------------------------------------------\n            Subtotal of nonduplicative profits      $ 8,642.45\n\n      Total damages award                                       $20,142.45\n\n            On appeal, Bruce challenges the amount of the damages\n\naward, contending that he is entitled to at least an additional\n\n$359,000.\n\n                                       II\n\n                                   DISCUSSION\n\n            We review de novo the legal determination as to the\n\nappropriate    standard      for   calculating        damages    awarded   as     a\n\nconsequence    of    copyright     infringements,       but     will   upset    the\n\nunderlying factual findings only upon a showing of clear error.\n\nSee Tamko Roofing Prods., Inc. v. Ideal Roofing Co., 282 F.3d 23,\n\n34   (1st   Cir.    2002).    A    plaintiff    who    establishes     copyright\n\ninfringement is entitled to recover (1) actual damages, which\n\nconsist of all income and profits lost as a consequence of the\n\ninfringement; and (2) any nonduplicative profits earned by the\n\n                                       5\n\fdefendant as a consequence of the copyright infringement, see 17\n\nU.S.C. § 504(b) (noting that plaintiff may recover “any profits .\n\n. . attributable to the infringement [that] are not taken into\n\naccount in computing the actual damages\").          See Data Gen. Corp. v.\n\nGrumman Systs. Support Corp., 36 F.3d 1147, 1170-77 (1st Cir.\n\n1994).\n\nActual Damages\n\n      A.   Applicable Legal Standard\n\n           At the outset, Bruce asserts that it was reversible error\n\nfor the district court to announce that the correct legal standard\n\nfor   calculating   actual    damages   is   “the   profits    lost    .   .   .\n\nresult[ing] . . . [from] the infringement,” Bruce, 150 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 316 (emphasis added), rather than the “reasonable fair market\n\nlicensing fees,” since the term “profits lost” more aptly applies\n\nto a distinct species of actual copyright damages, not pertinent\n\nhere, and refers not to the extent to which plaintiff was deprived\n\nof defendant’s fee, but rather the extent (if any) to which\n\ndefendant’s infringement prevented plaintiff from licensing his\n\nwork to clients or customers other than the defendant.                See Data\n\nGen. Corp., 36 F.3d at 1170-71; Hamil Am., Inc. v. GFI, 193 F.3d\n\n92, 107-08 (2d Cir. 1999); 3 Melville B. Nimmer & David Nimmer,\n\nNimmer on Copyright § 14.02[A] (2001). Yet, assuming arguendo that\n\nthe district court’s prefatory reference to “profits lost” was ill-\n\nfounded,   the   error   is   plainly   harmless,    see,     e.g.,    Southex\n\n\n                                    6\n\fExhibitions, Inc. v. R.I. Builders Ass’n, 279 F.3d 94, 103 (1st\n\nCir. 2002) (“‘[S]uch error [is] harmless if it is highly probable\n\nthat [it] did not affect the outcome of the case.'”) (citation\n\nomitted), since the body of its opinion makes it unmistakably clear\n\nthat       the   court   was   assessing    Bruce’s    actual   damages    through\n\nreference to the “[licensing] fees” which World News would have had\n\nto   pay     Bruce    were     it   not   for   the   unauthorized   use   of   the\n\nphotograph.2\n\n       B.        Apportionment of Actual Damages\n\n                 Next, Bruce contends that the district court erred by\n\nawarding only one half of the $2,200 licensing fees, see supra\n\nSection I (chart), in order to reflect Bruce’s 1992 contractual\n\nagreement to share all fees equally with The Picture Group, the\n\nphoto stock agency to which Bruce consigned the photograph.                  Since\n\nThe Picture Group went out of business in 1993, Bruce posits that\n\nhe was entitled to 100% of the fees thereafter, and, accordingly,\n\nthat World News was unjustly enriched by virtue of the district\n\ncourt’s fifty-percent reduction in the $2,200 licensing fees.\n\n                 Although considerable deference normally must be accorded\n\nthe findings of fact made by the district court, as well as its\n\nbalancing of the relevant equitable factors, see Invest Almaz v.\n\n\n       2\n      For instance, the         district court stated: “I conclude that an\ninflation adjusted fee          of $300 . . . is a fair award . . . [and]\nthat a fee of $500 for          the Clinton use and $300 for the Senators\nuse is appropriate.”            Bruce, 150 F. Supp. 2d at 321 (emphasis\nadded).\n\n                                            7\n\fTemple-Inland Forest Prods., 243 F.3d 57, 66 (1st Cir. 2001)\n\n(noting that unjust-enrichment rulings normally are reviewed for an\n\nabuse of discretion only), in the instant case we conclude that\n\nBruce is entitled to the fifty-percent share of the licensing fee\n\nwhich World News should have paid to The Picture Group in 1992 for\n\nits use of the Bruce photo.\n\n           Bruce freely contracted away his right to the fifty-\n\npercent share, and thus would be “made whole” upon receipt of the\n\nfifty-percent discount.   The unjust enrichment doctrine, however,\n\nrequires that the factfinder also consider whether World News, if\n\npermitted to retain The Picture Group’s share of the licensing fee,\n\nwould realize an unfair windfall such that justice and equity\n\nmandate be disgorged.     See id. at 64.   As The Picture Group is\n\npresently defunct, its $1,100 share would either be retained by\n\nWorld News or remitted to Bruce.     As World News is the copyright\n\ninfringer, Bruce unquestionably is the more deserving recipient.\n\nAccordingly, we   vacate the district court judgment insofar as it\n\ndiscounted the Bruce share of the licensing fee by fifty percent,\n\nand remand with directions to enter judgment for an additional\n\n$5,500 in damages in favor of Bruce (viz., $1,100 times multiplier\n\nof 5).   See Nowaczyk v. Warden, N.H. State Prison, 299 F.3d 69, 83\n\n(1st Cir. 2002) (noting that an “‘[a]buse [of discretion may\n\nresult] . . . when a material factor deserving significant weight\n\nis ignored”) (citation omitted).\n\n\n                                 8\n\f     C.     The Limitation of the Licensing Fees to the\n            Original Unauthorized Use by World News\n\n            Bruce next contends that the district court incorrectly\n\nruled that he was entitled to licensing fees solely for World News'\n\nfirst unauthorized editorial uses of his photograph in August 1992,\n\nbut not for each ensuing unauthorized use, such as its reprinting\n\nof prior World News covers and its uses in T-shirt and subscription\n\nadvertisements.    Bruce conjectures instead that he may have been\n\nable to negotiate a more lucrative per-use licensing contract with\n\nWorld News.    See Iowa State Univ. Res. Found., Inc. v. Am. Broad.\n\nCos., 475 F. Supp. 78, 83 (S.D.N.Y. 1979) (“[The infringer] cannot\n\nexpect to pay the same price in damages as it might have paid after\n\nfreely    negotiated   bargaining,        or   there   would    be   no    reason\n\nscrupulously to obey the copyright law.”), aff’d, 621 F.2d 57 (2d\n\nCir. 1980).\n\n            The present contention fails for several reasons. First,\n\nunder the copyright statute Bruce may recover actual damages only.\n\nSee Data Gen. Corp., 36 F.3d at 1170-77.               Accordingly, the sole\n\nissue before the district court was the amount of the reasonable\n\nlicensing fee Bruce likely would have received from World News for\n\neach of the above-listed uses had the parties reached a fee\n\nagreement, which presented what is first and foremost a question of\n\nfact, rather than law.          Thus, under the applicable standard of\n\nreview, the challenged determination constituted \"clear error only\n\nif, after     reviewing   the    entire    trial   record,     ‘we   are   firmly\n\n                                      9\n\fconvinced that a mistake has been made.’\" Southex Exhibitions, 279\n\nF.3d at 98-99 (citation omitted; emphasis added).              We perceive no\n\nsuch serious error.\n\n            First   and   foremost,    in   the   present     case,   proof   of\n\nindustry practice inarguably is crucial to the estimation of actual\n\ndamages.3    The record on appeal is replete with expert testimony\n\nthat,    given   the   prevailing     industry    practice,    there   was    no\n\nrealistic prospect whatsoever that Bruce could negotiate a per-use\n\nlicensing fee with World News.        Rather, the record discloses ample\n\nevidence that such a practice is rarely, if ever, indulged.\n\n            All Bruce managed to muster in reply was the testimony of\n\nhis own expert, Sheri Blaney, which included the conclusory and\n\nunsupported assertion that the licensing fee award “could be\n\nwhatever we feel is fair.” On the other hand, Darryl Jacobson, the\n\nexpert witness presented by World News, repeatedly and consistently\n\ntestified that, under the prevailing industry practice, Bruce\n\nalmost surely would not have been able to negotiate with World News\n\nfor anything other than a single, lump-sum, up-front licensing fee,\n\n\n     3\n      See, e.g., De Graffenried v. United States, 25 Cl. Ct. 209,\n220-21 (1992) (relying, in patent-infringement case, on evidence\nthat industry practice was to negotiate a single up-front royalty,\nrather than a per-use royalty); see also BellSouth Adver. & Publ’g\nCorp. v. Donnelley Info. Publ’g, Inc., 999 F.2d 1436, 1444 (11th\nCir. 1993); Endress & Hauser, Inc. v. Hawk Measurement Systs. Pty.\nLtd., 892 F. Supp. 1123, 1131 (S.D. Ind. 1995), aff’d, 122 F.3d\n1040 (Fed. Cir. 1997); Playboy Enters., Inc. v. Dumas, 831 F. Supp.\n295, 305 (S.D.N.Y. 1993); cf. Mills Music, Inc. v. Snyder, 469 U.S.\n153, 170-71 (1985) (assuming that Congress intended to incorporate\nprevailing industry practices when it enacted the copyright act).\n\n                                      10\n\fas distinguished from a per-use fee.       As but one glaring example of\n\nthe weaknesses in the Bruce proffer, Ms. Blaney was forced to\n\nconcede that, in her experience, Bruce could not have recovered a\n\nseparate fee each time the retouched photograph appeared in a T-\n\nshirt     advertisement.     Accordingly,      the   district    court,      qua\n\nfactfinder,     was   entitled   to    make    the     crucial   credibility\n\ndetermination as between the competing expert witnesses.                  See,\n\ne.g., Den Norske Bank AS v. First Nat’l Bank of Boston, 75 F.3d 49,\n\n57 (1st Cir. 1996).4\n\n     D.     Fees for T-Shirts Produced for World News But Not Sold\n\n            Further, Bruce argues that, in addition to the $800 in\n\nlicensing fees awarded to him for World News' use of his retouched\n\nphotograph on the two T-shirts, and the $8,642 in World News'\n\nrevenues realized from these T-shirt sales, he and his expert, Ms.\n\nBlaney, testified     that   Bruce    likely   would    have   been   able   to\n\nnegotiate for a royalty of somewhere between $1 and $3 on each T-\n\nshirt produced for World News, rather than merely those which World\n\nNews actually sold.     He contends that some T-shirts were produced,\n\nbut never sold; for example, that World News allegedly gave some T-\n\n\n\n     4\n      Appellant tries to rely on Iowa State which is wholly\ninapposite. That decision involved a different question under the\nCopyright Act of 1909: even where plaintiff had failed to prove\nactual damages, the court nonetheless was required by statute to\naward “in lieu” minimum damages for each infringement.       Thus,\nunlike the instant case, there the court needed to determine how\nmany discrete infringements were committed by the defendants. See\nIowa State Univ. Res. Found., 475 F. Supp. at 81.\n\n                                      11\n\fshirts away to customers purely for promotional purposes.\n\n           The present contention fails due to the fact that (i)\n\nBruce provided no conclusive evidence that there has ever been any\n\nsuch continuing-royalty contract in the industry, and (ii) Ms.\n\nBlaney, his own expert witness, conceded that, in twenty-five years\n\nof   experience,   she   had    yet   to   encounter   such   a   contractual\n\narrangement. Similarly, the expert witness presented by World News\n\ntestified that there was no prevailing industry practice for\n\nrecovering per-use royalties for promotional items, such as the two\n\nT-shirts here involved, which have a relatively short lifespan and\n\nlittle enduring commercial viability.           Accordingly, the district\n\ncourt decision declining the Bruce request for royalties did not\n\nconstitute clear error.        See Den Norske Bank AS, 75 F.3d at 57.\n\nNonduplicative Damages\n\n      A.   World News' Advertising Profits and Sales Revenues\n\n           Bruce next contends that the district court erred in\n\nrefusing to award him a share of the net profits which World News\n\nrealized from its advertising revenues and newstand or subscription\n\nsales attributable to its uses of the retouched photograph.            Bruce\n\nasserts that due to World News' failure to produce evidence of its\n\ngross revenues during discovery, he was forced to estimate those\n\nrevenues, based on his own ad hoc formula.        See Blackman v. Hustler\n\nMagazine, Inc., 800 F.2d 1160, 1164 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (fashioning\n\nsimilar remedy where copyright defendant frustrated plaintiff’s\n\n\n                                      12\n\faccess to evidence relating to profits).                 This contention is\n\nbaseless.\n\n             In   order   to    recover    profits,   Bruce   need   only   have\n\nestablished World News' gross revenues, at which point the burden\n\nwould have shifted to World News to establish that all or part of\n\nthe gross revenues were attributable to factors other than the\n\ncopyrighted work.      See 17 U.S.C. § 504(b); Data Gen. Corp., 36 F.3d\n\nat   1173.        Although     a   copyright   plaintiff      need   not    prove\n\nnonduplicative profits with mathematical certainty, neither can his\n\nproffer be “unduly speculative.” Id. at 1171 (citing Bus. Trends\n\nAnalysts, Inc. v. Freedonia Group, Inc., 887 F.2d 399, 404 (2d Cir.\n\n1989) and     Stevens Linen Assocs., Inc. v. Mastercraft Corp., 656\n\nF.2d 11, 14 (2d Cir. 1981)).\n\n             Bruce made no earnest attempt during discovery to obtain\n\nall the available evidence relating to World News' gross revenues.\n\nInstead, he merely requested that World News produce documents\n\nrelating to the profits “derived in any way or realized from the\n\nuse of Plaintiff’s Photograph.”           Although the request was arguably\n\nambiguous, World News unambiguously responded that it had earned no\n\nrevenues from its use of the Bruce photograph, except from the T-\n\nshirt sales.      Bruce neither objected to the World News response to\n\nhis interrogatories, nor moved to compel discovery of all World\n\nNews documents relating to gross revenues realized during the\n\ninfringement period.           Thus, rather than diligently pursuing the\n\n\n                                          13\n\fmost dependable and nonspeculative evidence as to World News' gross\n\nrevenues, Bruce deliberately elected to concoct a more lucrative\n\ncalculation, based upon questionable estimates and samplings,5\n\nrather than internal documents in the possession of World News.\n\nSee, e.g., Worster v. U.S. Postal Serv., No. 99-00726, 2002 WL\n\n242348, at *1 (4th Cir. Feb. 20, 2002) (holding that party’s\n\nfailure to file motion to compel production of documents waives\n\nargument on appeal); cf. Blackman, 800 F.2d at 1164 n.8 (noting\n\nthat plaintiff had made specific discovery request for all revenue\n\ndata).6\n\n     B.   Apportionment of Profits\n\n          Finally, Bruce maintains that the district court erred in\n\napportioning (on a 50-50 basis) between himself and World News, the\n\nprofits generated from the T-shirt sales, on the ground that\n\nBruce’s original photograph was responsible, at most, for one half\n\nthe effectiveness of the retouched photograph.    He contends that\n\nthe repetitive use of the retouched photograph by World News turned\n\nit into a sort of icon, which resulted in a valuation which\n\nexceeded the sum of its two components, see Bus. Trends Analysts,\n\n\n     5\n      Nor did Bruce adduce expert evidence that his calculus was\nreasonable or fairly representative.     Instead, for example, in\nestimating the World News newstand sales, Bruce simply assumed that\nWorld News took in the full cover charge on each sale, even though\nit is obvious that others in the distribution chain would have\nreceived a share.\n     6\n      Not surprisingly, Bruce submitted no reply brief on appeal in\nresponse to the waiver argument made by World News.\n\n                                14\n\fInc. v. Freedonia Group. Inc., 887 F.2d 399, 407 (2d Cir. 1989)\n\n(noting that apportionment may be “impossible” where two concepts\n\nhave become too intertwined), or made apportionment so speculative\n\nthat the benefit of any doubt should redound to plaintiff’s favor,\n\nsee Walker v. Forbes, Inc., 28 F.3d 409, 414 (4th Cir. 1994).\n\n          We review the issue of apportionment under the copyright\n\nstatute for abuse of discretion only.   See Data Gen. Corp., 36 F.3d\n\nat 1176 (noting that apportionment of profits requires courts to\n\nbalance various equitable factors, in a “delicate exercise informed\n\nby considerations of fairness and public policy”).     The district\n\ncourt was well within its discretion in its conclusion that Bruce’s\n\noriginal photograph (of Clinton and the Secret Service agent) was\n\nso routine and generic that it had very little market appeal,\n\nwhereas the bizarre nature of the retouched photograph gave it\n\nexponentially greater appeal.    The district court aptly cited case\n\nlaw where generic copyrighted material was later enhanced by so-\n\ncalled “star power,” such as Sheldon v. Metro-Goldwyn Pictures\n\nCorp., 309 U.S. 390, 398 (1940), and where plaintiff was awarded\n\nfar less than a 50% share.      Bruce, 150 F. Supp. 2d at 318.   In\n\nlight of these precedents, the district court not only did not\n\nabuse its discretion, it arguably was generous in apportioning as\n\nmuch as 50% of the profits to Bruce.\n\n          The judgment is hereby vacated in part, and the case\n\nremanded to the district court, with directions to modify the final\n\n\n                                  15\n\forder and judgment so as to increase appellant’s damages award by\n\n$5,500, for a total award of $25,642.45.   In all other respects,\n\nthe district court judgment is affirmed. Each party shall bear its\n\nown costs.   SO ORDERED.\n\n\n\n\n                               16\n\f",

Bruce appeals from a district court judgment which directed the tabloid Weekly World News (\"World News\") to pay him $20,142.45 in damages and nonduplicative profits due to its acknowledged copyright infringement. Bruce insists that he is entitled to additional damages amounting to between $359,000 and $406,000. With but one exception, the district court judgment is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">* <i>BACKGROUND</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1992, Bruce, a freelance photographer, photographed then-presidential-candidate William S. Clinton as he was shaking hands with an unidentified Secret Service agent. Later, Bruce consigned the photograph to The Picture Group, a photo stock agency. Thereafter, a World News photo editor contacted The Picture Group to obtain a photograph of Clinton while shaking hands. World News intended to alter any such photograph by superimposing, over the image of the person shaking Clinton's hand, its own image of the \"Space Alien.\" The \"Space Alien\" is a fictional extra-terrestrial creature which World News had been featuring prominently in its political campaign coverage ever since 1990. World News then proceeded to manipulate the Clinton photograph without first obtaining authorization from Bruce. The Picture Group and World News were unable to reach agreement on an appropriate licensing fee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the cover of its August 11, 1992 issue, World News published the retouched photograph, together with the banner \"Alien Backs Clinton!\" The Picture Group billed World News for $500, which it shared equally with Bruce pursuant to contract. Thereafter, on each occasion that the retouched photograph appeared in World News, The Picture Group sent World News a bill. Ultimately, Bruce realized a total of $1,775 in licensing fees. The Picture Group ceased its business operations in 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, in 1994, Bruce came upon a World News T-shirt advertisement utilizing the August 11, 1992 cover containing his retouched photograph. In due course, Bruce's counsel transmitted a cease-and-desist letter to World News, claiming copyright infringement. World News responded with an offer to pay $500 for a general release of the Bruce copyright. The same retouched photograph later appeared on a different T-shirt featuring World News' June 7, 1994 cover, containing photographs of twelve United States Senators, under the banner \"12 U.S. Senators Are Space Aliens!\" These T-shirt advertisements subsequently were repeated 188 times in World News, as well as numerous times on the World News Internet site. During this period, World News ordered 5,710 (and sold 1,817) of the \"Alien Backs Clinton\" T-shirts and ordered 4,767 (and sold 2,207) of the \"Senators Are Aliens\" T-shirts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an article entitled \"Alien Endorses Dole,\" appearing in the May 1996 issue, the World News <i>cover</i> included (1) another photograph of Clinton (not taken by Bruce) holding a copy of the August 11, 1992 issue of World News, <i>together with</i> Bruce's retouched photograph; as well as (2) the cover of the August 11, 1992 issue, among a collage of earlier World News covers. In the May 2000 issue, the retouched photograph appeared both as a small inset on the cover, which prominently featured a photograph of George Bush shaking hands with the Space Alien, <i>and</i> adjacent to the related news story inside. In addition, beginning in July 1995, the August 11, 1992 World News cover, containing Bruce's retouched photograph, appeared 48 times as part of a subscription advertisement placed inside the tabloid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1998, Bruce commenced the present action against World News for copyright infringement. <i>See</i> 17 U.S.C. &#167; 101 <i>et seq.</i> (1996 &amp; Supp. 2002). Following a bench trial, during which World News acknowledged its infringements, the district court awarded Bruce $20,142.45 in damages, plus interest. <i>Bruce v. Weekly World News, Inc.,</i> 150 F.Supp.2d 313 (D.Mass. 2001).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The damages award included nine components:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <pre><i>Actual Damages</i>\n\n     Editorial use of retouched photo on\n       5/28/96                               $    300\n     Additional editorial uses on 5/28/96\n       and 5/9/00                            $      0\n     Uses on two promotional T-shirts        $    800\n     Uses in T-shirt ads                     $      0\n     Uses in subscription ads                $      0\n     Uses on Internet site                   $  1,200\n     ________________________________________________\n     Subtotal                                $  2,300\n     Multiplier for unauthorized use         &#215;      5\n     ____________________________________________________\n     Subtotal of actual damages              $ 11,500.00\n\n<i>Nonduplicative Profits</i>\n\n     Sales of T-shirts                       $  8,642.45\n     Advertising revenues                    $      0\n     Newstand/subscription sales             $      0\n     ___________________________________________________\n     Subtotal of nonduplicative profits      $  8,642.45\n\n<i>Total damages award</i>                          $ 20,142.45</pre>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Bruce challenges the amount of the damages award, contending that he is entitled to at least an additional $359,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>DISCUSSION</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review <i>de novo</i> the legal determination as to the appropriate standard for calculating damages awarded as a consequence of copyright infringements, but will upset the underlying factual findings only upon a showing of clear error. <i>See Tamko Roofing Prods., Inc. v. Ideal Roofing Co.,</i> 282 F.3d 23, 34 (1st Cir.2002). A plaintiff who establishes copyright infringement is entitled to recover (1) actual damages, which consist of all income and profits lost as a consequence of the infringement; and (2) any nonduplicative profits earned by the defendant as a consequence of the copyright infringement, <i>see</i> 17 U.S.C. &#167; 504(b) (noting that plaintiff may recover \"any profits ... attributable to the infringement [that] are not taken into account in computing the actual damages\"). <i>See Data Gen. Corp. v. Grumman Systs. Support Corp.,</i> 36 F.3d 1147, 1170-77 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Actual Damages</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Applicable Legal Standard</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset, Bruce asserts that it was reversible error for the district court to announce that the correct legal standard for calculating actual damages is \"the <i>profits lost</i> ... result[ing] ... [from] the infringement,\" <i>Bruce,</i> 150 F.Supp.2d at 316 (emphasis added), rather than the \"reasonable fair market licensing fees,\" since the term \"profits lost\" more aptly applies to a distinct species of actual copyright damages, not pertinent here, and refers not to the extent to which plaintiff was deprived of <i>defendant's fee,</i> but rather the extent (if any) to which defendant's infringement prevented plaintiff from licensing his work to clients or customers <i>other than the defendant. See Data Gen. Corp.,</i> 36 F.3d at 1170-71; <i>Hamil Am., Inc. v. GFI,</i> 193 F.3d 92, 107-08 (2d Cir.1999); 3 Melville B. Nimmer &amp; David Nimmer, <i>Nimmer on Copyright</i> &#167; 14.02[A] (2001). Yet, assuming <i>arguendo</i> that the district court's prefatory reference to \"profits lost\" was ill-founded, the error is plainly harmless, <i>see, e.g., Southex Exhibitions, Inc. v. R.I. Builders Ass'n,</i> 279 F.3d 94, 103 (1st Cir. 2002) (\"`[S]uch error [is] harmless if it is highly probable that [it] did not affect the outcome of the case.'\") (citation omitted), since the body of its opinion makes it unmistakably clear that the court was assessing Bruce's actual damages through reference to the \"[licensing] fees\" which World News would have had to pay Bruce were it not for the unauthorized use of the photograph.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Apportionment of Actual Damages</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Bruce contends that the district court erred by awarding only one half of the $2,200 licensing fees, <i>see supra</i> Section I (chart), in order to reflect Bruce's 1992 contractual agreement to share all fees equally with The Picture Group, the photo stock agency to which Bruce consigned the photograph. Since The Picture Group went out of business in 1993, Bruce posits that he was entitled to 100% of the fees thereafter, and, accordingly, that World News was unjustly enriched by virtue of the district court's fifty-percent reduction in the $2,200 licensing fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although considerable deference normally must be accorded the findings of fact made by the district court, as well as its balancing of the relevant equitable factors, <i>see Invest Almaz v. Temple-Inland Forest Prods.,</i> 243 F.3d 57, 66 (1st Cir.2001) (noting that unjust-enrichment rulings normally are reviewed for an abuse of discretion only), in the instant case we conclude that Bruce is entitled to the fifty-percent share of the licensing fee which World News should have paid to The Picture Group in 1992 for its use of the Bruce photo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bruce freely contracted away his right to the fifty-percent share, and thus would be \"made whole\" upon receipt of the fifty-percent discount. The unjust enrichment doctrine, however, requires that the factfinder also consider whether World News, if permitted to retain The Picture Group's share of the licensing fee, would realize an unfair windfall such that justice and equity mandate be disgorged. <i>See id.</i> at 64. As The Picture Group is presently defunct, its $1,100 share would either be retained by World News or remitted to Bruce. As World News is the copyright infringer, Bruce unquestionably is the more deserving recipient. Accordingly, we vacate the district court judgment insofar as it discounted the Bruce share of the licensing fee by fifty percent, and remand with directions to enter judgment for an additional $5,500 in damages in favor of Bruce (<i>viz.,</i> $1,100 times multiplier of 5). <i>See Nowaczyk v. Warden, N.H. State Prison,</i> 299 F.3d 69, 83 (1st Cir.2002) (noting that an \"`[a]buse [of discretion may result] ... when a material factor deserving significant weight is ignored'\") (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>The Limitation of the Licensing Fees to the Original Unauthorized Use by World News</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bruce next contends that the district court incorrectly ruled that he was entitled to licensing fees solely for World News' first unauthorized editorial uses of his photograph in August 1992, but not for each ensuing unauthorized use, such as its reprinting of prior World News covers and its uses in T-shirt and subscription advertisements. Bruce conjectures instead that he may have been able to negotiate a more lucrative <i>per-use</i> licensing contract with World News. <i>See Iowa State Univ. Res. Found., Inc. v. Am. Broad. Cos.,</i> 475 F.Supp. 78, 83 (S.D.N.Y.1979) (\"[The infringer] cannot expect to pay the same price in damages as it might have paid after freely negotiated bargaining, or there would be no reason scrupulously to obey the copyright law.\"), <i>aff'd,</i> 621 F.2d 57 (2d Cir.1980).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The present contention fails for several reasons. First, under the copyright statute Bruce may recover <i>actual</i> damages only. <i>See Data Gen. Corp.,</i> 36 F.3d at 1170-77. Accordingly, the sole issue before the district court was the amount of the reasonable licensing fee Bruce likely would have received from World News for each of the above-listed uses had the parties reached a fee agreement, which presented what is first and foremost a question of fact, rather than law. Thus, under the applicable standard of review, the challenged determination constituted \"clear error only if, after reviewing the entire trial record, `we are <i>firmly convinced</i> that a mistake has been made.'\" <i>Southex Exhibitions,</i> 279 F.3d at 98-99 (citation omitted; emphasis added). We perceive no such serious error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First and foremost, in the present case, proof of industry practice inarguably is crucial to the estimation of actual damages.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The record on appeal is replete with expert testimony that, given the prevailing industry practice, there was no realistic prospect whatsoever that Bruce could negotiate a per-use licensing fee with World News. Rather, the record discloses ample evidence that such a practice is rarely, if ever, indulged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All Bruce managed to muster in reply was the testimony of his own expert, Sheri Blaney, which included the conclusory and unsupported assertion that the licensing fee award \"could be whatever we feel is fair.\" On the other hand, Darryl Jacobson, the expert witness presented by World News, repeatedly and consistently testified that, under the prevailing industry practice, Bruce almost surely would not have been able to negotiate with World News for anything other than a single, lump-sum, up-front licensing fee, as distinguished from a per-use fee. As but one glaring example of the weaknesses in the Bruce proffer, Ms. Blaney was forced to concede that, in her experience, Bruce could not have recovered a separate fee each time the retouched photograph appeared in a T-shirt advertisement. Accordingly, the district court, <i>qua</i> factfinder, was entitled to make the crucial credibility determination as between the competing expert witnesses. <i>See, e.g., Den Norske Bank AS v. First Nat'l Bank of Boston,</i> 75 F.3d 49, 57 (1st Cir.1996).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D. <i>Fees for T-Shirts Produced for World News But Not Sold</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, Bruce argues that, in addition to the $800 in licensing fees awarded to him for World News' use of his retouched photograph on the two T-shirts, and the $8,642 in World News' revenues realized from these T-shirt sales, he and his expert, Ms. Blaney, testified that Bruce likely would have been able to negotiate for a royalty of somewhere between $1 and $3 on each T-shirt <i>produced</i> for World News, rather than merely those which World News actually sold. He contends that some T-shirts were produced, but never sold; for example, that World News allegedly gave some T-shirts away to customers purely for promotional purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The present contention fails due to the fact that (i) Bruce provided no conclusive evidence that there has ever been any such continuing-royalty contract in the industry, and (ii) Ms. Blaney, his own expert witness, conceded that, in twenty-five years of experience, she had yet to encounter such a contractual arrangement. Similarly, the expert witness presented by World News testified that there was no prevailing industry practice for recovering per-use royalties for promotional items, such as the two T-shirts here involved, which have a relatively short lifespan and little enduring commercial viability. Accordingly, the district court decision declining the Bruce request for royalties did not constitute clear error. <i>See Den Norske Bank AS,</i> 75 F.3d at 57.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Nonduplicative Damages</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>World News' Advertising Profits and Sales Revenues</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bruce next contends that the district court erred in refusing to award him a share of the net profits which World News realized from its advertising revenues and newstand or subscription sales attributable to its uses of the retouched photograph. Bruce asserts that due to World News' failure to produce evidence of its gross revenues during discovery, he was forced to estimate those revenues, based on his own ad hoc formula. <i>See Blackman v. Hustler Magazine, Inc.,</i> 800 F.2d 1160, 1164 (D.C.Cir.1986) (fashioning similar remedy where copyright defendant frustrated plaintiff's access to evidence relating to profits). This contention is baseless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to recover profits, Bruce need only have established World News' gross revenues, at which point the burden would have shifted to World News to establish that all or part of the gross revenues were attributable to factors other than the copyrighted work. <i>See</i> 17 U.S.C. &#167; 504(b); <i>Data Gen. Corp.,</i> 36 F.3d at 1173. Although a copyright plaintiff need not prove nonduplicative profits with mathematical certainty, neither can his proffer be \"unduly speculative.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1171 (citing <i>Bus. Trends Analysts, Inc. v. Freedonia Group, Inc.,</i> 887 F.2d 399, 404 (2d Cir.1989) and <i>Stevens Linen Assocs., Inc. v.

Instead, he merely requested that World News produce documents relating to the profits \"derived in any way or realized from the use of Plaintiff's Photograph.\" Although the request was arguably ambiguous, World News unambiguously responded that it had earned <i>no revenues</i> from its use of the Bruce photograph, except from the T-shirt sales. Bruce neither objected to the World News response to his interrogatories, nor moved to compel discovery of all World News documents relating to gross revenues realized during the infringement period. Thus, rather than diligently pursuing the most dependable and nonspeculative evidence as to World News' gross revenues, Bruce deliberately elected to concoct a more lucrative calculation, based upon questionable estimates and samplings,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> rather than internal documents in the possession of World News. <i>See, e.g., Worster v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</i> 28 Fed.Appx. 324, 326 (4th Cir.2002) (holding that party's failure to file motion to compel production of documents waives argument on appeal); <i>cf.

He contends that the repetitive use of the retouched photograph by World News turned it into a sort of icon, which resulted in a valuation which exceeded the sum of its two components, <i>see Bus. Trends Analysts, Inc. v. Freedonia Group. Inc.,</i> 887 F.2d 399, 407 (2d Cir.1989) (noting that apportionment may be \"impossible\" where two concepts have become too intertwined), or made apportionment so speculative that the benefit of any doubt should redound to plaintiff's favor, <i>see Walker v.

Corp.,</i> 36 F.3d at 1176 (noting that apportionment of profits requires courts to balance various equitable factors, in a \"delicate exercise informed by considerations of fairness and public policy\"). The district court was well within its discretion in its conclusion that Bruce's original photograph (of Clinton and the Secret Service agent) was so routine and generic that it had very little market appeal, whereas the bizarre nature of the retouched photograph gave it exponentially greater appeal. The district court aptly cited case law where generic copyrighted material was later enhanced by so-called \"star power,\" such as <i>Sheldon v. Metro-Goldwyn Pictures Corp.,</i> 309 U.S. 390, 398, 60 S.Ct. 681, 84 L.Ed. 825 (1940), and where plaintiff was awarded far less than a 50% share. <i>Bruce,</i> 150 F.Supp.2d at 318.

Bruce appeals from a district court judgment which directed the tabloid Weekly World News (\"World News\") to pay him $20,142.45 in damages and nonduplicative profits due to its acknowledged copyright infringement. Bruce insists that he is entitled to additional damages amounting to between $359,000 and $406,000. With but one exception, the district court judgment is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">* <i>BACKGROUND</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1992, Bruce, a freelance photographer, photographed then-presidential-candidate William S. Clinton as he was shaking hands with an unidentified Secret Service agent. Later, Bruce consigned the photograph to The Picture Group, a photo stock agency. Thereafter, a World News photo editor contacted The Picture Group to obtain a photograph of Clinton while shaking hands. World News intended to alter any such photograph by superimposing, over the image of the person shaking Clinton's hand, its own image of the \"Space Alien.\" The \"Space Alien\" is a fictional extra-terrestrial creature which World News had been featuring prominently in its political campaign coverage ever since 1990. World News then proceeded to manipulate the Clinton photograph without first obtaining authorization from Bruce. The Picture Group and World News were unable to reach agreement on an appropriate licensing fee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the cover of its August 11, 1992 issue, World News published the retouched photograph, together with the banner \"Alien Backs Clinton!\" The Picture Group billed World News for $500, which it shared equally with Bruce pursuant to contract. Thereafter, on each occasion that the retouched photograph appeared in World News, The Picture Group sent World News a bill. Ultimately, Bruce realized a total of $1,775 in licensing fees. The Picture Group ceased its business operations in 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, in 1994, Bruce came upon a World News T-shirt advertisement utilizing the August 11, 1992 cover containing his retouched photograph. In due course, Bruce's counsel transmitted a cease-and-desist letter to World News, claiming copyright infringement. World News responded with an offer to pay $500 for a general release of the Bruce copyright. The same retouched photograph later appeared on a different T-shirt featuring World News' June 7, 1994 cover, containing photographs of twelve United States Senators, under the banner \"12 U.S. Senators Are Space Aliens!\" These T-shirt advertisements subsequently were repeated 188 times in World News, as well as numerous times on the World News Internet site. During this period, World News ordered 5,710 (and sold 1,817) of the \"Alien Backs Clinton\" T-shirts and ordered 4,767 (and sold 2,207) of the \"Senators Are Aliens\" T-shirts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an article entitled \"Alien Endorses Dole,\" appearing in the May 1996 issue, the World News <i>cover</i> included (1) another photograph of Clinton (not taken by Bruce) holding a copy of the August 11, 1992 issue of World News, <i>together with</i> Bruce's retouched photograph; as well as (2) the cover of the August 11, 1992 issue, among a collage of earlier World News covers. In the May 2000 issue, the retouched photograph appeared both as a small inset on the cover, which prominently featured a photograph of George Bush shaking hands with the Space Alien, <i>and</i> adjacent to the related news story inside. In addition, beginning in July 1995, the August 11, 1992 World News cover, containing Bruce's retouched photograph, appeared 48 times as part of a subscription advertisement placed inside the tabloid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1998, Bruce commenced the present action against World News for copyright infringement. <i>See</i> 17 U.S.C. &#167; 101 <i>et seq.</i> (1996 &amp; Supp. 2002). Following a bench trial, during which World News acknowledged its infringements, the district court awarded Bruce $20,142.45 in damages, plus interest. <i>Bruce v.

Nimmer &amp; David Nimmer, <i>Nimmer on Copyright</i> &#167; 14.02[A] (2001). Yet, assuming <i>arguendo</i> that the district court's prefatory reference to \"profits lost\" was ill-founded, the error is plainly harmless, <i>see, e.g., Southex Exhibitions, Inc. v. R.I.

Since The Picture Group went out of business in 1993, Bruce posits that he was entitled to 100% of the fees thereafter, and, accordingly, that World News was unjustly enriched by virtue of the district court's fifty-percent reduction in the $2,200 licensing fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although considerable deference normally must be accorded the findings of fact made by the district court, as well as its balancing of the relevant equitable factors, <i>see Invest Almaz v. Temple-Inland Forest Prods.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199312\"><a href=\"/opinion/199312/invest-almaz-v-temple-inland/\"><span class=\"volume\">243</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span>, 66 (1st Cir.2001) (noting that unjust-enrichment rulings normally are reviewed for an abuse of discretion only), in the instant case we conclude that Bruce is entitled to the fifty-percent share of the licensing fee which World News should have paid to The Picture Group in 1992 for its use of the Bruce photo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bruce freely contracted away his right to the fifty-percent share, and thus would be \"made whole\" upon receipt of the fifty-percent discount. The unjust enrichment doctrine, however, requires that the factfinder also consider whether World News, if permitted to retain The Picture Group's share of the licensing fee, would realize an unfair windfall such that justice and equity mandate be disgorged. <i>See id.</i> at 64. As The Picture Group is presently defunct, its $1,100 share would either be retained by World News or remitted to Bruce. As World News is the copyright infringer, Bruce unquestionably is the more deserving recipient. Accordingly, we vacate the district court judgment insofar as it discounted the Bruce share of the licensing fee by fifty percent, and remand with directions to enter judgment for an additional $5,500 in damages in favor of Bruce (<i>viz.,</i> $1,100 times multiplier of 5). <i>See Nowaczyk v.

First, under the copyright statute Bruce may recover <i>actual</i> damages only. <i>See Data Gen. Corp.,</i> 36 F.3d at 1170-77. Accordingly, the sole issue before the district court was the amount of the reasonable licensing fee Bruce likely would have received from World News for each of the above-listed uses had the parties reached a fee agreement, which presented what is first and foremost a question of fact, rather than law. Thus, under the applicable standard of review, the challenged determination constituted \"clear error only if, after reviewing the entire trial record, `we are <i>firmly convinced</i> that a mistake has been made.'\" <i>Southex Exhibitions,</i> 279 F.3d at 98-99 (citation omitted; emphasis added). We perceive no such serious error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First and foremost, in the present case, proof of industry practice inarguably is crucial to the estimation of actual damages.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The record on appeal is replete with expert testimony that, given the prevailing industry practice, there was no realistic prospect whatsoever that Bruce could negotiate a per-use licensing fee with World News. Rather, the record discloses ample evidence that such a practice is rarely, if ever, indulged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All Bruce managed to muster in reply was the testimony of his own expert, Sheri Blaney, which included the conclusory and unsupported assertion that the licensing fee award \"could be whatever we feel is fair.\" On the other hand, Darryl Jacobson, the expert witness presented by World News, repeatedly and consistently testified that, under the prevailing industry practice, Bruce almost surely would not have been able to negotiate with World News for anything other than a single, lump-sum, up-front licensing fee, as distinguished from a per-use fee. As but one glaring example of the weaknesses in the Bruce proffer, Ms. Blaney was forced to concede that, in her experience, Bruce could not have recovered a separate fee each time the retouched photograph appeared in a T-shirt advertisement. Accordingly, the district court, <i>qua</i> factfinder, was entitled to make the crucial credibility determination as between the competing expert witnesses. <i>See, e.g., Den Norske Bank AS v. First Nat'l Bank of Boston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196552\"><a href=\"/opinion/196552/den-norske-bank-as-v-first-natl-of-bost/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span>, 57 (1st Cir.1996).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D. <i>Fees for T-Shirts Produced for World News But Not Sold</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, Bruce argues that, in addition to the $800 in licensing fees awarded to him for World News' use of his retouched photograph on the two T-shirts, and the $8,642 in World News' revenues realized from these T-shirt sales, he and his expert, Ms. Blaney, testified that Bruce likely would have been able to negotiate for a royalty of somewhere between $1 and $3 on each T-shirt <i>produced</i> for World News, rather than merely those which World News actually sold. He contends that some T-shirts were produced, but never sold; for example, that World News allegedly gave some T-shirts away to customers purely for promotional purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The present contention fails due to the fact that (i) Bruce provided no conclusive evidence that there has ever been any such continuing-royalty contract in the industry, and (ii) Ms. Blaney, his own expert witness, conceded that, in twenty-five years of experience, she had yet to encounter such a contractual arrangement. Similarly, the expert witness presented by World News testified that there was no prevailing industry practice for recovering per-use royalties for promotional items, such as the two T-shirts here involved, which have a relatively short lifespan and little enduring commercial viability. Accordingly, the district court decision declining the Bruce request for royalties did not constitute clear error. <i>See Den Norske Bank AS,</i> 75 F.3d at 57.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Nonduplicative Damages</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>World News' Advertising Profits and Sales Revenues</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bruce next contends that the district court erred in refusing to award him a share of the net profits which World News realized from its advertising revenues and newstand or subscription sales attributable to its uses of the retouched photograph. Bruce asserts that due to World News' failure to produce evidence of its gross revenues during discovery, he was forced to estimate those revenues, based on his own ad hoc formula. <i>See Blackman v. Hustler Magazine, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"476264\"><a href=\"/opinion/476264/barry-m-blackman-v-hustler-magazine-inc-barry-m-blackman-v-hustler/\"><span class=\"volume\">800</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1160</span></a></span>, 1164 (D.C.Cir.1986) (fashioning similar remedy where copyright defendant frustrated plaintiff's access to evidence relating to profits).

Corp.,</i> 36 F.3d at 1173. Although a copyright plaintiff need not prove nonduplicative profits with mathematical certainty, neither can his proffer be \"unduly speculative.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1171 (citing <i>Bus.

Instead, he merely requested that World News produce documents relating to the profits \"derived in any way or realized from the use of Plaintiff's Photograph.\" Although the request was arguably ambiguous, World News unambiguously responded that it had earned <i>no revenues</i> from its use of the Bruce photograph, except from the T-shirt sales. Bruce neither objected to the World News response to his interrogatories, nor moved to compel discovery of all World News documents relating to gross revenues realized during the infringement period. Thus, rather than diligently pursuing the most dependable and nonspeculative evidence as to World News' gross revenues, Bruce deliberately elected to concoct a more lucrative calculation, based upon questionable estimates and samplings,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> rather than internal documents in the possession of World News. <i>See, e.g., Worster v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</i> 28 Fed.Appx. 324, 326 (4th Cir.2002) (holding that party's failure to file motion to compel production of documents waives argument on appeal); <i>cf. Blackman,</i> 800 F.2d at 1164 n. 8 (noting that plaintiff had made specific discovery request for all revenue data).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Apportionment of Profits</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Bruce maintains that the district court erred in apportioning (on a 50-50 basis) between himself and World News, the profits generated from the T-shirt sales, on the ground that Bruce's original photograph was responsible, at most, for one half the effectiveness of the retouched photograph. He contends that the repetitive use of the retouched photograph by World News turned it into a sort of icon, which resulted in a valuation which exceeded the sum of its two components, <i>see Bus. Trends Analysts, Inc. v. Freedonia Group. Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"530542\"><a href=\"/opinion/530542/business-trends-analysts-inc-v-the-freedonia-group-inc-and-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">887</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">399</span></a></span>, 407 (2d Cir.1989) (noting that apportionment may be \"impossible\" where two concepts have become too intertwined), or made apportionment so speculative that the benefit of any doubt should redound to plaintiff's favor, <i>see Walker v. Forbes, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"673435\"><a href=\"/opinion/673435/wesley-m-walker-jr-v-forbes-incorporated/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">409</span></a></span>, 414 (4th Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the issue of apportionment under the copyright statute for abuse of discretion only. <i>See Data Gen. Corp.,</i> 36 F.3d at 1176 (noting that apportionment of profits requires courts to balance various equitable factors, in a \"delicate exercise informed by considerations of fairness and public policy\"). The district court was well within its discretion in its conclusion that Bruce's original photograph (of Clinton and the Secret Service agent) was so routine and generic that it had very little market appeal, whereas the bizarre nature of the retouched photograph gave it exponentially greater appeal. The district court aptly cited case law where generic copyrighted material was later enhanced by so-called \"star power,\" such as <i>Sheldon v. Metro-Goldwyn Pictures Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103317\"><a href=\"/opinion/103317/sheldon-v-metro-goldwyn-pictures-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">309</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">390</span></a></span>, 398, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
