Jay A. García-Gregory, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n                         Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                       Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                  and Carter,* Senior District Judge.\n\n\n     Jesús Hernández-Sánchez, with whom Raúl Barrera-Morales,\nFredeswin Pérez-Caballero and Jesús Hernández-Sánchez Law Firm,\nwere on brief, for appellants.\n     Gloriana S.

Plaintiff-appellant Frank\n\nCepero-Rivera was the Director of Labor Affairs of the Human\n\nResources Department of the Puerto Rico Highway Authority (\"PRHA\"),\n\nuntil he was terminated for violations of the PRHA's Rules and\n\nRegulations.     Cepero-Rivera and his daughter, Jennifer Cepero-\n\nSalgado, claim that Cepero-Rivera's termination was motivated by\n\nhis political affiliation in violation of his constitutional rights\n\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 & 1985, and they now appeal the\n\ndistrict   court's    dismissal    of        their    claims    against   certain\n\ndefendants, its grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant\n\nFernando   Fagundo,   and   its    determination         that    the   procedures\n\nfollowed   in   Cepero-Rivera's        termination      did    not   violate   due\n\nprocess. After examining the record, we reject each of appellants'\n\narguments, and affirm the order of the district court.\n\n                                  I.    Facts\n\n           The chain of events leading to appellant Cepero's firing\n\nbegan on September 24, 2001, when Cepero-Rivera wrote a letter to\n\nthe former PRHA Executive Director, Fernando Fagundo, requesting a\n\nsalary increase in accordance with a PRHA regulation that required\n\na one-step pay increase for employees who had not been given a pay\n\nraise equivalent to one step in the pay scale over the preceding\n\nfive years.     In the letter, Cepero-Rivera also stated that he\n\npossessed a list of the salaries and fringe benefits of several\n\nrecently-appointed female employees. Based on this information, he\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\falleged gender and age discrimination, and that the salary raises\n\ngiven to those female employees violated the merit principle\n\nestablished in the PRHA Personnel Handbook.\n\n            Cepero-Rivera did not receive the response he had hoped\n\nfor.   On January 2, 2002, Fagundo sent Cepero-Rivera a letter\n\ndenying his request for a salary raise because he had received six\n\npay raises in as many years with the PRHA.                  In the same letter,\n\nFagundo informed Cepero-Rivera that he had ordered the PRHA's legal\n\ndepartment to investigate possible violations of the Puerto Rico\n\nPenal Code and several articles of the PRHA's Disciplinary Measures\n\nHandbook, including two alleged violations of infraction 37 of the\n\nHandbook, which prohibits using confidential personnel records for\n\npersonal gain.         Fagundo's letter outlined the underlying facts\n\nrelating to Cepero-Rivera's admitted possession of other employees'\n\nconfidential information in his September letter and a previous\n\ninstance   in   which     he    appended        portions   of    defendant       Howard\n\nPhillip's confidential personnel records to a memorandum about\n\nPhillip. Fagundo's letter additionally alleged insubordination and\n\ninvolvement in various incidents with other PRHA employees.                         The\n\nletter informed Cepero-Rivera of Fagundo's intentions to file\n\ndisciplinary measures, which could result in dismissal, and that an\n\ninformal   hearing      was    to   be    held    on   January   18,     2002.      The\n\nJanuary    2,   2002    letter      was   Cepero-Rivera's        first    notice     of\n\ndefendants' intentions to take disciplinary measures against him.\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\f              On January 10, 2002, Cepero-Rivera sent a letter to\n\nFagundo   responding       to   the       allegations      that    he     had     misused\n\nconfidential personnel records and requesting more information\n\nabout   the    specific    facts      underlying      the    insubordination          and\n\nmisconduct allegations. Cepero-Rivera's request was never answered\n\nby defendants.      On January 17, 2002, Cepero-Rivera sent Fagundo a\n\nhandwritten note stating that the January 2 letter did not state\n\nthe time of the hearing, and thus, he was handing in certain\n\ndocuments \"as evidence of [his] appearance in writing to the\n\ninformal hearing.\"        On February 22, 2002, Cepero-Rivera received a\n\nletter officially terminating his employment with the PRHA.\n\n                                   II.     Analysis\n\n              Appellants    make    four        distinct    arguments        on   appeal.\n\nFirst, appellants claim that district court erred in requiring\n\nCepero-Rivera      to    present      a    prima     facie      case    of      political\n\ndiscrimination against Eric Ramírez-Nazario, Samuel De La Rosa, and\n\nWilliam Vega.      Second, appellants argue that the district court\n\nerred in dismissing, sua sponte, the claims against Harry Díaz-\n\nVega, Roberto Santiago-Cancel, and Howard Phillip Figueroa. Third,\n\nappellants challenge the grant of summary judgment in favor of\n\ndefendant     Fernando     Fagundo        for    failure   to     rebut      defendants'\n\nproffered nondiscriminatory basis for Cepero-Rivera's dismissal.\n\nFinally, Cepero-Rivera argues that the procedure leading to his\n\n\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\ftermination did not afford him due process of law.            We address each\n\nof plaintiffs' claims in turn.\n\nA.   The District Court's Misapplication of the Prima Facie Case\n     Standard\n\n            Appellants contend that the district court incorrectly\n\napplied a heightened pleading standard to Ramírez's, De la Rosa's,\n\nand Vega's motion to dismiss. Although the district court in large\n\npart correctly described the motion to dismiss standard, see Rivera\n\nv. Fagundo, 301 F. Supp. 2d 103, 106 (D.P.R. 2004), it also stated\n\nthat   appellants'     claims   should     be   dismissed    for    failure   to\n\n\"establish a prima facie case of political discrimination,\" id. at\n\n108.   Appellees concede that appellants did not have the burden of\n\nestablishing a prima facie case in order to survive a motion to\n\ndismiss.    However, they argue that appellants nevertheless clearly\n\nfailed to meet their burden under the proper Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n8(a)(2) standard, and thus, the ultimate decision to dismiss should\n\nbe affirmed.    We agree.\n\n            \"For   years,   courts    in    this   circuit   [had]    required\n\nplaintiffs to satisfy a heightened pleading standard in civil\n\nrights     actions.\"     Educadores        Puertorriqueños    en    Acción    v.\n\nHernández, 367 F.3d 61, 62 (1st Cir. 2004). However, in Hernández,\n\nthis   court   recognized   that     the    Supreme   Court's      decision   in\n\nSwierkiewicz v. Sorema N. A., 534 U.S. 506 (2002), \"sounded the\n\ndeath knell for the imposition of a heightened pleading standard\n\nexcept in cases in which either a federal statute or specific Civil\n\n                                     -5-\n\fRule requires that result.\"     Hernández, 367 F.3d at 66.          \"In all\n\nother cases, courts faced with the task of adjudicating motions to\n\ndismiss   under   Rule   12(b)(6)   must     apply   the   notice   pleading\n\nrequirements of Rule 8(a)(2).\"        Id.     Since there is no federal\n\nstatute or specific Federal Rule of Civil Procedure mandating a\n\nheightened pleading standard for civil rights actions such as the\n\npolitical discrimination claims at issue in this appeal, the notice\n\npleading standard, not the heightened pleading standard formerly\n\napplied in this circuit, governs motions to dismiss.\n\n           The case before us appears at first glance to present\n\nprecisely the same situation that we resolved in Hernández.            As in\n\nHernández, the district court in this case dismissed plaintiffs'\n\npolitical discrimination claims on the basis that plaintiffs failed\n\nto establish a prima facie case.          Compare Rivera, 301 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 108, with Hernández, 367 F.3d at 63.               On this basis, in\n\nHernández, we remanded the case to the district court to            proceed\n\nin light of the proper standard.      367 F.3d at 68.       Appellants ask\n\nthat we follow suit in the instant case.\n\n           Notwithstanding the citations to the \"prima facie case\"\n\nstandard, it does not, however, appear that the district court in\n\nthis case applied a heightened pleading standard.               Rather, it\n\nlooked to the complaint and found that the allegations therein\n\nfailed to make out a claim against these defendants.          Furthermore,\n\nwe find that remand would be unnecessary, because appellants'\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fclaims in question clearly fail to survive the proper Rule 8(a)(2)\n\nnotice pleading standard.\n\n          Under Rule 8(a)(2), a complaint need only include \"a\n\nshort and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is\n\nentitled to relief.\"      Id. at 66.       \"This statement must 'give the\n\ndefendant fair notice of what the plaintiff's claim is and the\n\ngrounds upon which it rests.'\"       Id. (quoting Conley v. Gibson, 355\n\nU.S. 41, 47 (1957)).        Under this standard, \"a court confronted\n\nwith a Rule 12(b)(6) motion 'may dismiss a complaint only if it is\n\nclear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that\n\ncould be proved consistent with the allegations.'\"              Id. (quoting\n\nHishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 73 (1984)).\n\n          Appellants' allegations against defendants Ramírez, De la\n\nRosa, and Vega are not simply vague or lacking in specificity.\n\nRather, they consist entirely of speculation about possible future\n\nconduct by the defendants.          Defendants are members of PRHA's\n\nAppeals Committee, which is to hear the administrative complaints\n\nCepero-Rivera filed as a result of the actions taken against him.\n\nCepero-Rivera    claims   that    these    defendants   \"will   entertain   a\n\npending appeal . . . and will carry out the public policy of\n\ndiscrimination    because    of    their    political    ideology    against\n\nplaintiff and are ready to rubber stamp the decision of co-\n\ndefendant Fagundo.\"       Rivera, Amended Complaint, ¶ 10 (emphasis\n\n\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fadded).     To date, the only proceedings that have taken place on\n\nthis matter before the Appeals Committee, have been:\n\n            \"(1) attempts by Cepero-Rivera to consolidate\n            both complaints, which were denied; (2) a\n            request by the PRHA for Cepero-Rivera's\n            counsel to withdraw, because of conflict of\n            interest   issues;    (3)   a    request   by\n            Cepero-Rivera to stay the administrative\n            proceedings pending resolution of this case;\n            and (4) a hearing called by Ramírez for the\n            sole purpose of recusing himself from both\n            complaints because he appeared as a defendant\n            in this case.\"\n\nRivera, 301 F. Supp. 2d at 107-08.\n\n            To prevail in a § 1983 claim, plaintiffs \"must allege\n\nfacts sufficient to support a determination (i) that the conduct\n\ncomplained of has been committed under color of state law, and (ii)\n\nthat [the alleged] conduct worked a denial of rights secured by the\n\nConstitution or laws of the United States.\" Romero-Barceló v.\n\nHernández-Agosto,     75   F.3d   23,   32   (1st    Cir.   1996)   (citations\n\nomitted).    As an additional corollary, only those individuals who\n\nparticipated in the conduct that deprived the plaintiff of his\n\nrights    can    be   held    liable.          Cf.     Febus-Rodríguez      v.\n\nBetancourt-Lebrón, 14 F.3d 87, 91-92 (1st Cir. 1994) (finding that\n\nthere is no § 1983 liability on the basis of respondeat superior,\n\nand thus, \"[a] supervisor may be found liable only on the basis of\n\nhis own acts or omissions\"); Wilson v. City of N. Little Rock, 801\n\nF.2d 316, 322 (8th Cir. 1986) (finding, in a § 1983 action against\n\npolice officers, that \"[l]iability may be found only if there is\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fpersonal involvement of the officer being sued\"). As the district\n\ncourt correctly recognized, defendants \"Ramírez, De la Rosa, and\n\nVega have not taken any action adverse to plaintiff, nor did they\n\nhave anything to do with Fagundo's and PRHA's decision to terminate\n\nCepero-Rivera from his employment.\"             Rivera, 301 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n108.    Since these defendants clearly played no part in any action\n\ntaken against plaintiff, we have no difficulty concluding that \"it\n\nis clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts\n\nthat could be proved consistent with the allegations\" against these\n\ndefendants.      Hernández,   367    F.3d      at    66   (internal   quotations\n\nomitted).    Thus, this unusual attempt to rope in defendants whose\n\nonly actions against defendant might come at some point in the\n\nfuture fails the notice pleading standard. We therefore affirm the\n\ndistrict    court's   dismissal     of   the    claims     against    defendants\n\nRamírez, De la Rosa, and Vega.\n\nB.     Dismissal of the Claims against Díaz, Santiago and Phillip\n\n            Unlike their co-defendants on the Appeals Committee,\n\ndefendants Díaz, Santiago, and Phillip did not seek Rule 12(b)(6)\n\ndismissal of the claims against them.               Nevertheless, the district\n\ncourt dismissed the claims against Díaz, Santiago, and Phillip sua\n\nsponte.     We find that the court's sua sponte dismissal was in\n\nerror, but that the error was harmless because the court should\n\nhave granted defendants' motion for summary judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\f           Sua sponte dismissal is rarely appropriate, and should\n\nnot have been entered under these circumstances.                    \"Sua sponte\n\ndismissals are strong medicine, and should be dispensed sparingly.\"\n\nChute v. Walker, 281 F.3d 314, 319 (1st Cir. 2002) (quoting\n\nGonzález-González, 257 F.3d 31 at 33).             \"The general rule is that\n\n'in limited circumstances, sua sponte dismissals of complaints\n\nunder   Rule   12(b)(6)   .   .   .    are    appropriate,'   but   that   'such\n\ndismissals are erroneous unless the parties have been afforded\n\nnotice and an opportunity to amend the complaint or otherwise\n\nrespond.'\"     Id. (quoting Futura Dev. of P.R., Inc. v. Estado Libre\n\nAsociado de P.R., 144 F.3d 7, 13-14 (1st Cir. 1998)).               Because the\n\nplaintiffs in this case were not given notice or an opportunity to\n\namend their complaint, sua sponte dismissal was in error.\n\n           Nevertheless, we find that the error is harmless because\n\nthe district court should have granted Díaz's, Santiago's and\n\nPhillip's motion for summary judgment.                In its decision, the\n\ndistrict court dismissed the claims against Díaz, Santiago, and\n\nPhillip in the course of its analysis of \"Defendants' Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment.\"     Rivera, 301 F. Supp. 2d at 110-11.             The court\n\nfound that \"Cepero-Rivera had failed to establish a prima facie\n\ncase against Díaz, Santiago, and Phillip by failing to demonstrate\n\nthat they were personally and directly involved in the alleged\n\nviolation of his rights.\"             Id. at 111.     Having found that the\n\nappellants failed to meet this summary judgment threshold, the\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\fdistrict court should have granted summary judgment in favor of\n\nthese defendants.   However, at this point, the court erroneously\n\nchose to grant sua sponte dismissal instead.       Nevertheless, we\n\nfind, for the same reasons alluded to by the district court, that\n\nappellants' failed to establish a prima facie case, and thus,\n\nsummary judgment should have been granted.\n\n          With regard to defendants Díaz, Santiago, and Phillip,\n\nappellants alleged in their complaint that:\n\n                 8. Co-defendant Santiago Cancel, [sic]\n          planned along with co-defendant Howard Phillip\n          Figueroa   to   provoke   an   incident   with\n          plaintiff, which took place as follows: Co-\n          defendant Phillip Figueroa went to plaintiff's\n          office to provoke him, informing the latter\n          that he was coming to see him under the\n          instructions of co-defendant Santiago Cancel.\n          Co-defendant Phillip Figueroa asked plaintiff\n          Why [sic] he did not resign and leave his\n          position to a PDP attorney.\n                 9. Co-defendant Harry Díaz Vega, Area\n          Director for Human Resources of the PRHA,\n          talked to plaintiff several times, criticizing\n          him because plaintiff was protesting for the\n          illegal action taken by co-defendant Fagundo\n          in appointing some female personnel with a\n          high salary and in violation of the merit\n          system.    Also, he told plaintiff the new\n          administration's goals, which was [sic] to\n          have employees in key positions, loyal to the\n          PDP and pointed to plaintiff that he was from\n          the NPP and that he should join the PDP.\n          Plaintiff refused and replied \"I'd rather be\n          dead.\"\n\nRivera, Amended Complaint, paras. 8-9.       Nothing in appellants'\n\nOpposition to [Defendants'] Motion for Summary Judgment or in the\n\nrecord significantly adds to these allegations. The district court\n\n\n                               -11-\n\fdescribed     these    claims   as   a   \"general   and    unsubstantiated\n\n'conspiracy theory,'\" and found that Cepero-Rivera had failed to\n\nshow how these defendants played any role in the alleged violation\n\nof his rights.        Rivera, 301 F. Supp. 2d at 111.          Cepero-Rivera\n\nclaims that these defendants \"all conspired with Fagundo to provoke\n\nCepero-Rivera     into    confrontations    in   order    to    justify   his\n\ndismissal.\"     Id.   However, even assuming -- as we must on summary\n\njudgment -- that these confrontations occurred exactly as Cepero-\n\nRivera recounts them, they played little if any role in creating\n\nthe primary basis cited for Cepero-Rivera's dismissal: his alleged\n\nuse of confidential documents. Furthermore, Cepero-Rivera makes no\n\nother claim as to how defendants Díaz, Santiago and Phillip played\n\nany role in the actual termination decision or process.\n\n            In order for appellants to succeed on their claim of\n\npolitical discrimination, they must demonstrate that the defendants\n\nwere involved in the alleged deprivation of their rights -- in this\n\ncase, Cepero-Rivera's dismissal from the PRHA.                 Imposition of\n\nliability requires that \"the conduct complained of must have been\n\ncausally connected to the deprivation.\" Gutiérrez-Rodríguez v.\n\nCartagena, 882 F.2d 553, 559 (1st Cir. 1989) (internal quotations\n\nomitted).     In this case, the allegations against Díaz, Santiago,\n\nand Phillip could help build a prima facie case against Fagundo,\n\nwho the record suggests was involved in the decision to terminate\n\nCepero-Rivera's employment. However, since appellants have made no\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fallegation, and we see no reason to infer, that defendants Díaz,\n\nSantiago and Phillip were involved in the decision to dismiss\n\nCepero-Rivera, or that their alleged attempts to provoke Cepero-\n\nRivera led to his discharge, summary judgment should have been\n\ngranted in favor of these defendants.    Furthermore, we note that\n\nthese defendants would also be entitled to summary judgment for the\n\nsame reasons we explain below with regard to defendant Fagundo.\n\nTherefore, the district court's sua sponte dismissal, though in\n\nerror, did not prejudice the appellants, and we do not disturb the\n\nfinal disposition reached by the district court with regard to\n\nthese defendants.\n\nC.   Summary Judgment in Favor of Defendant Fagundo\n\n          The remaining individual defendant in this case is PRHA\n\nExecutive Director Fernando Fagundo, who ordered the investigation\n\nleading to Cepero-Rivera's dismissal.   We now consider appellants'\n\nchallenge to the district court's grant of summary judgment in\n\nfavor of defendant Fagundo.\n\n          We review the district court's entry of summary judgment\n\nde novo, viewing all facts in the light most favorable to the\n\nnonmoving party and granting all reasonable inferences in that\n\nparty's favor.   See, e.g., Torres v. E.I. Dupont De Nemours & Co.,\n\n219 F.3d 13, 18 (1st Cir. 2000).   Summary judgment is appropriate\n\n\"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and\n\nadmissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that\n\n\n                               -13-\n\fthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the\n\nmoving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"                Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 56(c).     We will also uphold summary judgment where \"the\n\nnonmoving    party    rests      merely   upon   conclusory    allegations,\n\nimprobable inferences, and unsupported speculation,\" Rivera-Cotto\n\nv. Rivera, 38 F.3d 611, 613 (1st Cir. 1994) (internal quotation\n\nomitted).\n\n            Claims of political discrimination are subject to the\n\nburden-shifting analysis developed after Mt. Healthy City Sch.\n\nDist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274 (1977).                Under that\n\nanalysis, \"a plaintiff bears the initial burden of showing that\n\npolitical discrimination was the substantial or motivating factor\n\nin a defendant's employment decision. The defendant must then show\n\nthat the decision would have been the same even in the absence of\n\nthe protected conduct.\"       Avilés-Martínez, 963 F.2d at 5 (internal\n\ncitations omitted).      Because \"Fagundo acted under color of state\n\nlaw, belongs to an opposing political party, is the one directly\n\nresponsible for Cepero-Rivera's dismissal, and it is alleged that\n\nCepero-Rivera's      political    affiliation    was   the   basis   for   his\n\nactions,\" the district court found that appellants' claims against\n\nFagundo established a prima facie case.          Rivera, 301 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n111.\n\n            Once plaintiffs establish a prima facie case, \"[t]he\n\nburden then shifts to the defendant official to articulate a\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fnondiscriminatory basis for the adverse employment action, and\n\nprove by a preponderance of the evidence that the adverse action\n\nwould have been taken regardless of any discriminatory political\n\nmotivation.\"1   LaRou v. Ridlon, 98 F.3d 659, 661 (1st Cir. 1996);\n\nsee also Rodríguez-Ríos v. Cordero, 138 F.3d 22, 24 (1st Cir.\n\n1998).   In this case, defendants had little difficulty laying out\n\nthe   nondiscriminatory   reasons   for   Cepero-Rivera's   dismissal.\n\nDefendants contend, and appellants do not deny, that Cepero-\n\nRivera's letter of September 24 stated that he possessed a list of\n\nfemale employees' salaries and fringe benefits. Even viewed in the\n\nlight most favorable to appellants, we cannot but conclude that\n\nthis letter gave Fagundo every reason to believe that Cepero-Rivera\n\nhad improperly obtained this information from personnel files in\n\nviolation of PHRA regulations. Defendants also allege, and Cepero-\n\nRivera does not deny, that he had previously attached forty-eight\n\npages of Phillips' personnel file to a letter in which he argued\n\n\n\n1\n   We stress that under the Mt. Healthy burden shifting scheme,\nunlike Title VII cases, the burden of persuasion actually shifts to\ndefendants after plaintiff establishes a prima facie case. See\nAcevedo-Díaz v. Aponte, 1 F.3d 62, 67 (1st Cir. 1993). Under Title\nVII, once the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the\nemployer need only submit enough evidence to raise a genuine issue\nof material fact - i.e., only the burden of production shifts to\nthe employer.    Id.    However, in a First Amendment political\ndiscrimination case, in which the Mt. Healthy scheme is applicable,\n\"the burden of persuasion shifts to the defendant, [and] the\nplaintiff-employee will prevail unless the fact finder concludes\nthat the defendant has produced enough evidence to establish that\nthe plaintiff's dismissal would have occurred in any event for\nnondiscriminatory reasons.\" Id.\n\n                                -15-\n\fthat Phillips was mentally unstable -- an impermissible use of\n\nconfidential personnel information under PRHA                 regulations.    In\n\naddition, defendants allege, and Cepero-Rivera does not deny, that\n\nhe refused to recognize the appointment of Santiago as his direct\n\nsupervisor, which defendants characterize as insubordination. Like\n\nthe district court, we find that, given the seriousness of Cepero-\n\nRivera's violations of PRHA regulations, defendants easily meet\n\ntheir burden of showing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that\n\nCepero-Rivera would have been dismissed regardless of his political\n\naffiliation.      See Larou, 98 F.3d at 661.          Once Cepero-Rivera made\n\nthe   misstep   of   claiming     physical       possession    of   confidential\n\npersonnel records, it is difficult to see how a supervisor in\n\nFagundo's position could have done anything less than order an\n\ninvestigation, potentially resulting in the employee's dismissal.\n\n            Nevertheless,    at    this     point,    \"the    plaintiff[s]   may\n\ndiscredit    the     proffered     nondiscriminatory           reason,     either\n\ncircumstantially      or    directly,       by     adducing     evidence     that\n\ndiscrimination was more likely than not a motivating factor.\"\n\nPadilla-García v. Guillermo Rodríguez, 212 F.3d 69, 77 (1st Cir.\n\n2000). Appellants' efforts in this regard fail to convince us that\n\ndiscrimination was more likely than not a motivating factor in\n\nCepero-Rivera's dismissal.         Appellants offer nothing to directly\n\nundermine   the    credibility     of   the      proffered    nondiscriminatory\n\nreasons for Cepero-Rivera's dismissal.               Their only attack on the\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fsubstance of these allegations is the contention that when Cepero-\n\nRivera said he had \"in [his] power a list of the[se] employees\n\n. . . with their salaries and fringe benefits,\" he meant only that\n\nhe had a copy of the office telephone book, from which he could\n\ndeduce his female employees' salaries.                    Even accepting Cepero-\n\nRivera's      explanation,      we    find       that    the   explanation       is   so\n\nimplausible that it should not have caused any doubt in the minds\n\nof the PRHA officials considering his termination.                          Having been\n\ntold by Cepero-Rivera himself, when he thought it suited his\n\ninterest, that he possessed a list of salaries and fringe benefits\n\nof the organization's female employees, we do not see why his\n\nemployers should believe Cepero-Rivera's later explanation that he\n\nhad meant only that he had made such a list himself by guessing at\n\nsalary and benefits from the office phonebook, especially in light\n\nof   his   earlier      use    of    portions       of    Phillip's         confidential\n\ninformation.        Thus, although on summary judgment we assume Cepero-\n\nRivera's      explanation      to    be   genuine,       it    does    not     undermine\n\ndefendants proffered nondiscriminatory basis.\n\n              In    their   brief,    appellants        contend    that      defendants'\n\nproffered reasons for Cepero-Rivera's dismissal were \"nothing but\n\nan   excuse    to    justify   the    real   reason,       which      was    politically\n\nmotivated.\"        However, they offer only meager evidence to support\n\nthat contention. Appellants allege that Fagundo once asked Cepero-\n\nRivera when he was leaving his position, since a new administration\n\n\n                                          -17-\n\fhad taken office.     However, they do not offer any evidence that\n\nthis incident was anything more than a mistake as to Cepero-\n\nRivera's status as a career employee.         Nor do they assert that\n\nthere was any follow-up conversation or point to other indicia of\n\nanimus toward Cepero-Rivera on the part of Fagundo.               Appellants\n\nalso state that Phillip suggested that Cepero-Rivera should resign\n\nand leave his post to a PDP employee, and that Díaz suggested that\n\nCepero-Rivera change his party affiliation to the PDP.             This type\n\nof evidence can serve to show that the proffered nondiscriminatory\n\nbasis for an employee's dismissal was only pretext.                 However,\n\ngiven the gravity of the charges against Cepero-Rivera, and the\n\nfact that they are based on his own admissions that he possessed\n\nconfidential     personnel   information,    this     evidence    fails   to\n\ndemonstrate that political discrimination was more likely than not\n\na motivating factor in his dismissal.\n\n          Appellants' arguments that the charges against Cepero-\n\nRivera were time-barred also fail to convince us that defendants'\n\nreasons   for    Cepero-Rivera's     dismissal      were   mere     pretext,\n\nparticularly as they do not reach the primary charge of personnel\n\nfile   misuse.     Appellants'   only     remaining    arguments     address\n\nirregular procedures followed in the course of his dismissal.\n\nHowever, these arguments do not relate to the grounds for Cepero-\n\nRivera's dismissal.    We consider these arguments in our discussion\n\nof his due process claims.\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\fD.   Due Process Claims\n\n             Appellants         additionally        claim    that       Cepero-Rivera's\n\ndismissal violated his procedural due process rights.                       There is no\n\ndispute     between      the    parties     that    Cepero-Rivera        was   a   career\n\nemployee, and as such was entitled to \"notice and a meaningful\n\nopportunity to respond prior to termination.\"                     Figueroa-Serrano v.\n\nRamos-Alverio,          221    F.3d    1,   5-6    (1st    Cir.    2000)    (quotations\n\nomitted).     Before a career employee is discharged, he is \"entitled\n\nto   oral    or    written      notice      of    the    charges    against    him,   an\n\nexplanation of the employer's evidence, and an opportunity to\n\npresent his side of the story.\"                         Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v.\n\nLoudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 546 (1985).                    \"To require more than this\n\nprior to termination would intrude to an unwarranted extent on the\n\ngovernment's        interest      in    quickly     removing       an   unsatisfactory\n\nemployee.\"        Id.\n\n             The process leading up to Cepero-Rivera's termination\n\nbegan with Fagundo's January 2, 2002 letter in response to Cepero-\n\nRivera's September 24, 2001 letter arguing for a salary increase\n\nand alleging gender bias in favor of female employees. In addition\n\nto responding to his request and allegations, the letter informed\n\nCepero-Rivera: (1) that he was under investigation for possible\n\nviolation of PRHA regulations, because he had used confidential\n\npersonnel documents for personal benefit; (2) that Fagundo intended\n\nto file charges against him that could result in the termination of\n\n\n                                            -19-\n\fhis employment; (3) that he had the right to a pre-termination\n\nhearing; and (4) that an informal hearing would take place on\n\nJanuary 18, 2002 in the Office of the Legal Counsel's library,\n\nwhere he could present his version of the facts and show cause as\n\nto why disciplinary measures should not be instituted against him.2\n\nOn January 10, Cepero-Rivera responded with a letter in which he\n\nanswered a number of the allegations against him and requested more\n\ninformation about others.    He also requested that the informal\n\nhearing scheduled for January 18 be continued to a later date.   No\n\none in the PRHA administration responded to this letter, and on\n\nJanuary 17, Cepero-Rivera addressed a note to Fagundo asserting\n\nthat the January 2 letter did not state the time of the hearing,\n\nand \"[t]hus, [he was] handing in these documents as evidence of\n\n[his] appearance in writing to the informal hearing.\"      Cepero-\n\nRivera did not attend the January 18 informal hearing, and on\n\nFebruary 22, Executive Director Fagundo sent a letter officially\n\ndischarging Cepero-Rivera from his position.\n\n          Appellants    claims      that   this    procedure     was\n\nconstitutionally deficient in a number of ways.   First, appellants\n\n\n2\n  Cepero-Rivera claims this notice was deficient for, among other\nreasons, its failure to state the time of the scheduled hearing.\nHowever, he does not claim to have made any attempt to find out the\ntime of the hearing. In fact, it seems the first time he mentioned\nthe failure to specify a time was in the note he wrote to Fagundo\nthe day before the scheduled hearing, in which he stated that he\nwould not attend. Like the district court, we assume that this\ninformation could have been easily obtained, and we do not consider\nits omission to be a fatal flaw in the notice provided.\n\n                                 -20-\n\fseem to claim that Cepero-Rivera was not provided sufficient notice\n\nof the facts underlying the allegations for which he might be\n\ndismissed.      After a thorough review of the record, we find that\n\nappellants overstate this claim.               At the outset, we note that the\n\nprincipal allegations against Cepero-Rivera related to his use of\n\nconfidential      personnel     documents,        which,     in     one   instance,   he\n\nappended to a memorandum regarding defendant Phillip and, in the\n\nother, he stated he possessed in his letter of September 24, 2001.\n\nThese facts underlying the violation of the PRHA's Disciplinary\n\nMeasures    Handbook      infraction      37     --   the    only    infraction   that\n\ndefendants claim allows for termination after a single violation --\n\nwere clearly laid out in Fagundo's January 2 letter.                       Although we\n\nagree   that      the     factual    underpinnings           of     the   accompanying\n\nallegations lacked the specificity included in the most serious\n\nallegations, we do not find that they fall below the constitutional\n\nbaseline.      See, e.g., Brasslett v. Cota, 761 F.2d 827, 836 (1st\n\nCir. 1985) (finding no due process violation even where an employee\n\nwas notified of the possibility of discharge during the same \"one\n\nhour conference\" that constituted his informal hearing).\n\n            Nor    do    we   see   any    merit      in    Cepero-Rivera's     claims\n\nregarding his request for a continuance.                    At no time did Cepero-\n\nRivera assert that he could not attend the informal hearing on the\n\nscheduled date.         Rather, his request was apparently based entirely\n\non his belief that he needed more specific facts in order to craft\n\n\n                                          -21-\n\fa defense.      However, in his zeal to defend himself, Cepero-Rivera\n\nmay have misunderstood the nature of a pre-termination hearing.\n\nDue process requires only that the pre-termination hearing fulfill\n\nthe purpose of \"an initial check against mistaken decisions --\n\nessentially,     a    determination         of     whether   there   are    reasonable\n\ngrounds to believe that the charges against the employee are true\n\nand support the proposed action.\"                 Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 545-46.\n\nAs   evidenced       by   his     own   thorough       written   responses      to     the\n\nallegations against him, Cepero-Rivera was given ample notice of\n\nthe bases for the termination proceedings against him.\n\n             Although the PRHA failed to make any response to Cepero-\n\nRivera's request for a continuance, common sense and Cepero-\n\nRivera's own note of January 17 indicate that he knew that the\n\nhearing was still set for January 18.                     In fact, in that note,\n\nCepero-Rivera stated that he was submitting his case in writing\n\nrather   than    appear      in    person     at    the   informal      hearing.       Cf.\n\nMercado-Alicea v. P.R. Tourism Co., 396 F.3d 46, 53 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(finding that where plaintiff failed to attend his informal hearing\n\nafter    multiple         reschedulings,         defendants      \"did     not   violate\n\n[plaintiff's] due process rights when his inability to present his\n\nside of the story was due to his failure to participate\").                           While\n\nit is regrettable that the PRHA did not respond to Cepero-Rivera's\n\nrequest for      a    continuance       and      for   additional    facts,     we    have\n\nexplained that \"the Constitution requires only an initial check\n\n\n                                          -22-\n\fagainst   erroneous    decisions,   not    that   the   state   follow   best\n\npractices.\"    O'Neill v. Baker, 210 F.3d 41, 49 n.10 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).    In this case, Cepero-Rivera was given an opportunity to\n\nattend an informal pre-termination hearing; he simply chose to\n\npresent his arguments in writing.          Due process requires nothing\n\nmore from his employer at that stage.\n\n                            III.    Conclusion\n\n           For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the decision of the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -23-\n\f",

In the letter, Cepero-Rivera also stated that he possessed a list of the salaries and fringe benefits of several recently-appointed female employees. Based on this information, he alleged gender and age discrimination, and that the salary raises given to those female employees violated the merit principle established in the PRHA Personnel Handbook.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cepero-Rivera did not receive the response he had hoped for. On January 2, 2002, Fagundo sent Cepero-Rivera a letter denying his request for a salary raise because he had received six pay raises in as many years with the PRHA. In the same letter, Fagundo informed Cepero-Rivera that he had ordered the PRHA's legal department to investigate possible violations of the Puerto Rico Penal Code and several articles of the PRHA's Disciplinary Measures Handbook, including two alleged violations of infraction 37 of the Handbook, which prohibits using confidential personnel records for personal gain. Fagundo's letter outlined the underlying facts relating to Cepero-Rivera's admitted possession of other employees' confidential information in his September letter and a previous instance in which he appended portions of defendant Howard Phillip's confidential personnel records to a memorandum about Phillip. Fagundo's letter additionally alleged insubordination and involvement in various incidents with other PRHA employees. The letter informed Cepero-Rivera of Fagundo's intentions to file disciplinary measures, which could result in dismissal, and that an informal hearing was to be held on January 18, 2002. The January 2, 2002 letter was Cepero-Rivera's first notice of defendants' intentions to take disciplinary measures against him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 10, 2002, Cepero-Rivera sent a letter to Fagundo responding to the allegations that he had misused confidential personnel records and requesting more information about the specific facts underlying the insubordination and misconduct allegations. Cepero-Rivera's request was never answered by defendants. On January 17, 2002, Cepero-Rivera sent Fagundo a handwritten note stating that the January 2 letter did not state the time of the hearing, and thus, he was handing in certain documents \"as evidence of [his] appearance in writing to the informal hearing.\" On February 22, 2002, Cepero-Rivera received a letter officially terminating his employment with the PRHA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Analysis</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants make four distinct arguments on appeal. First, appellants claim that district court erred in requiring Cepero-Rivera to present a <i>prima facie</i> case of political discrimination against Eric Ram&#237;rez-Nazario, Samuel De La Rosa, and William Vega. Second, appellants argue that the district court erred in dismissing, <i>sua sponte,</i> the claims against Harry D&#237;az-Vega, Roberto Santiago-Cancel, and Howard Phillip Figueroa. Third, appellants challenge the grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant Fernando Fagundo for failure to rebut defendants' proffered nondiscriminatory basis for Cepero-Rivera's dismissal. Finally, Cepero-Rivera argues that the procedure leading to his termination did not afford him due process of law. We address each of plaintiffs' claims in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The District Court's Misapplication of the Prima Facie Case Standard</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants contend that the district court incorrectly applied a heightened pleading standard to Ram&#237;rez's, De la Rosa's, and Vega's motion to dismiss. Although the district court in large part correctly described the motion to dismiss standard, <i>see Rivera v. Fagundo,</i> 301 F.Supp.2d 103, 106 (D.P.R.2004), it also stated that appellants' claims should be dismissed for failure to \"establish a <i>prima facie</i> case of political discrimination,\" <i>id.</i> at 108. Appellees concede that appellants did not have the burden of establishing a <i>prima facie</i> case in order to survive a motion to dismiss. However, they argue that appellants nevertheless clearly failed to meet their burden under the proper Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2) standard, and thus, the ultimate decision to dismiss should be affirmed. We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"For years, courts in this circuit [had] required plaintiffs to satisfy a heightened pleading standard in civil rights actions.\" <i>Educadores Puertorrique&#241;os en Acci&#243;n v.

Hern&#225;ndez-Agosto,</i> 75 F.3d 23, 32 (1st Cir.1996) (citations omitted).

Betancourt-Lebr&#243;n,</i> 14 F.3d 87, 91-92 (1st Cir.1994) (finding that there is no &#167; 1983 liability on the basis of <i>respondeat superior,</i> and thus, \"[a] supervisor may be found liable only on the basis of his own acts or omissions\"); <i>Wilson v.

As the district court correctly recognized, defendants \"Ram&#237;rez, De la Rosa, and Vega have not taken any action adverse to plaintiff, nor did they have anything to do with Fagundo's and PRHA's decision to terminate Cepero-Rivera from his employment.\" <i>Rivera,</i> 301 F.Supp.2d at 108. Since these defendants clearly played no part in any action taken against plaintiff, we have no difficulty concluding that \"it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations\" against these defendants. <i>Hern&#225;ndez,</i> 367 F.3d at 66 (internal quotations omitted). Thus, this unusual attempt to rope in defendants whose only actions against defendant might come at some point in the future fails the notice pleading standard. We therefore affirm the district court's dismissal of the claims against defendants Ram&#237;rez, De la Rosa, and Vega.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Dismissal of the Claims against D&#237;az, Santiago and Phillip</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike their co-defendants on the Appeals Committee, defendants D&#237;az, Santiago, and Phillip did not seek Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal of the claims against them.

Having found that the appellants failed to meet this summary judgment threshold, the district court should have granted summary judgment in favor of these defendants. However, at this point, the court erroneously chose to grant <i>sua sponte</i> dismissal instead.

Nothing in appellants' Opposition to [Defendants'] Motion for Summary Judgment or in the record significantly adds to these allegations.

Cepero-Rivera claims that these defendants \"all conspired with Fagundo to provoke Cepero-Rivera into confrontations in order to justify his dismissal.\" <i>Id.</i> However, even assuming &#8212; as we must on summary judgment &#8212; that these confrontations occurred exactly as Cepero-Rivera recounts them, they played little if any role in creating the primary basis cited for Cepero-Rivera's dismissal: his alleged use of confidential documents. Furthermore, Cepero-Rivera makes no other claim as to how defendants D&#237;az, Santiago and Phillip played any role in the actual termination decision or process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order for appellants to succeed on their claim of political discrimination, they must demonstrate that the defendants were involved in the alleged deprivation of their rights &#8212; in this case, Cepero-Rivera's dismissal from the PRHA.

In this case, the allegations against D&#237;az, Santiago, and Phillip could help build a <i>prima facie</i> case against Fagundo, who the record suggests was involved in the decision to terminate Cepero-Rivera's employment. However, since appellants have made no allegation, and we see no reason to infer, that defendants D&#237;az, Santiago and Phillip were involved in the decision to dismiss Cepero-Rivera, or that their alleged attempts to provoke Cepero-Rivera led to his discharge, summary judgment should have been granted in favor of these defendants. Furthermore, we note that these defendants would also be entitled to summary judgment for the same reasons we explain below with regard to defendant Fagundo. Therefore, the district court's <i>sua sponte</i> dismissal, though in error, did not prejudice the appellants, and we do not disturb the final disposition reached by the district court with regard to these defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Summary Judgment in Favor of Defendant Fagundo</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remaining individual defendant in this case is PRHA Executive Director Fernando Fagundo, who ordered the investigation leading to Cepero-Rivera's dismissal.

Summary judgment is appropriate \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). We will also uphold summary judgment where \"the nonmoving party rests merely upon conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation,\" <i>Rivera-Cotto v. Rivera,</i> 38 F.3d 611, 613 (1st Cir.1994) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claims of political discrimination are subject to the burden-shifting analysis developed after <i>Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle,</i> 429 U.S. 274, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977). Under that analysis, \"a plaintiff bears the initial burden of showing that political discrimination was the substantial or motivating factor in a defendant's employment decision. The defendant must then show that the decision would have been the same even in the absence of the protected conduct.\" <i>Avil&#233;s-Mart&#237;nez,</i> 963 F.2d at 5 (internal citations omitted). Because \"Fagundo acted under color of state law, belongs to an opposing political party, is the one directly responsible for Cepero-Rivera's dismissal, and it is alleged that Cepero-Rivera's political affiliation was the basis for his actions,\" the district court found that appellants' claims against Fagundo established a <i>prima facie</i> case. <i>Rivera,</i> 301 F.Supp.2d at 111.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once plaintiffs establish a <i>prima facie</i> case, \"[t]he burden then shifts to the defendant official to articulate a nondiscriminatory basis for the adverse employment action, and prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the adverse action would have been taken regardless of any discriminatory political motivation.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> <i>LaRou v. Ridlon,</i> 98 F.3d 659, 661 (1st Cir.1996); <i>see also Rodr&#237;guez-R&#237;os v. Cordero,</i> 138 F.3d 22, 24 (1st Cir.1998). In this case, defendants had little difficulty laying out the nondiscriminatory reasons for Cepero-Rivera's dismissal. Defendants contend, and appellants do not deny, that Cepero-Rivera's letter of September 24 stated that he possessed a list of female employees' salaries and fringe benefits. Even viewed in the light most favorable to appellants, we cannot but conclude that this letter gave Fagundo every reason to believe that Cepero-Rivera had improperly obtained this information from personnel files in violation of PHRA regulations. Defendants also allege, and Cepero-Rivera does not deny, that he had previously attached forty-eight pages of Phillips' personnel file to a letter in which he argued that Phillips was mentally unstable &#8212; an impermissible use of confidential personnel information under PRHA regulations. In addition, defendants allege, and Cepero-Rivera does not deny, that he refused to recognize the appointment of Santiago as his direct supervisor, which defendants characterize as insubordination. Like the district court, we find that, given the seriousness of Cepero-Rivera's violations of PRHA regulations, defendants easily meet their burden of showing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Cepero-Rivera would have been dismissed regardless of his political affiliation. <i>See LaRou,</i> 98 F.3d at 661. Once Cepero-Rivera made the misstep of claiming physical possession of confidential personnel records, it is difficult to see how a supervisor in Fagundo's position could have done anything less than order an investigation, potentially resulting in the employee's dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, at this point, \"the plaintiff[s] may discredit the proffered nondiscriminatory reason, either circumstantially or directly, by adducing evidence that discrimination was more likely than not a motivating factor.\" <i>Padilla-Garc&#237;a v. Guillermo Rodr&#237;guez,</i> 212 F.3d 69, 77 (1st Cir.2000). Appellants' efforts in this regard fail to convince us that discrimination was more likely than not a motivating factor in Cepero-Rivera's dismissal. Appellants offer nothing to directly undermine the credibility of the proffered nondiscriminatory reasons for Cepero-Rivera's dismissal. Their only attack on the substance of these allegations is the contention that when Cepero-Rivera said he had \"in [his] power a list of the[se] employees . . . with their salaries and fringe benefits,\" he meant only that he had a copy of the office telephone book, from which he could deduce his female employees' salaries. Even accepting Cepero-Rivera's explanation, we find that the explanation is so implausible that it should not have caused any doubt in the minds of the PRHA officials considering his termination. Having been told by Cepero-Rivera himself, when he thought it suited his interest, that he possessed a list of salaries and fringe benefits of the organization's female employees, we do not see why his employers should believe Cepero-Rivera's later explanation that he had meant only that he had made such a list himself by guessing at salary and benefits from the office phonebook, especially in light of his earlier use of portions of Phillip's confidential information. Thus, although on summary judgment we assume Cepero-Rivera's explanation to be genuine, it does not undermine defendants proffered nondiscriminatory basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their brief, appellants contend that defendants' proffered reasons for Cepero-Rivera's dismissal were \"nothing but an excuse to justify the real reason, which was politically motivated.\" However, they offer only meager evidence to support that contention. Appellants allege that Fagundo once asked Cepero-Rivera when he was leaving his position, since a new administration had taken office. However, they do not offer any evidence that this incident was anything more than a mistake as to Cepero-Rivera's status as a career employee. Nor do they assert that there was any follow-up conversation or point to other indicia of animus toward Cepero-Rivera on the part of Fagundo. Appellants also state that Phillip suggested that Cepero-Rivera should resign and leave his post to a PDP employee, and that D&#237;az suggested that Cepero-Rivera change his party affiliation to the PDP. This type of evidence can serve to show that the proffered nondiscriminatory basis for an employee's dismissal was only pretext. However, given the gravity of the charges against Cepero-Rivera, and the fact that they are based on his own admissions that he possessed confidential personnel information, this evidence fails to demonstrate that political discrimination was more likely than not a motivating factor in his dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' arguments that the charges against Cepero-Rivera were time-barred also fail to convince us that defendants' reasons for Cepero-Rivera's dismissal were mere pretext, particularly as they do not reach the primary charge of personnel file misuse. Appellants' only remaining arguments address irregular procedures followed in the course of his dismissal. However, these arguments do not relate to the grounds for Cepero-Rivera's dismissal. We consider these arguments in our discussion of his due process claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. <i>Due Process Claims</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants additionally claim that Cepero-Rivera's dismissal violated his procedural due process rights.

Ramos-Alverio,</i> 221 F.3d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir.2000) (quotations omitted).

In addition to responding to his request and allegations, the letter informed Cepero-Rivera: (1) that he was under investigation for possible violation of PRHA regulations, because he had used confidential personnel documents for personal benefit; (2) that Fagundo intended to file charges against him that could result in the termination of his employment; (3) that he had the right to a pre-termination hearing; and (4) that an informal hearing would take place on January 18, 2002 in the Office of the Legal Counsel's library, where he could present his version of the facts and show cause as to why disciplinary measures should not be instituted against him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> On January 10, Cepero-Rivera responded with a letter in which he answered a number of the allegations against him and requested more information about others.

No one in the PRHA administration responded to this letter, and on January 17, Cepero-Rivera addressed a note to Fagundo asserting that the January 2 letter did not state the time of the hearing, and \"[t]hus, [he was] handing in these documents as evidence of [his] appearance in writing to the informal hearing.\" Cepero-Rivera did not attend the January 18 informal hearing, and on February 22, Executive Director Fagundo sent a letter officially discharging Cepero-Rivera from his position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants claims that this procedure was constitutionally deficient in a number of ways. First, appellants seem to claim that Cepero-Rivera was not provided sufficient notice of the facts underlying the allegations for which he might be dismissed. After a thorough review of the record, we find that appellants overstate this claim. At the outset, we note that the principal allegations against Cepero-Rivera related to his use of confidential personnel documents, which, in one instance, he appended to a memorandum regarding defendant Phillip and, in the other, he stated he possessed in his letter of September 24, 2001. These facts underlying the violation of the PRHA's Disciplinary Measures Handbook infraction 37 &#8212; the only infraction that defendants claim allows for termination after a single violation &#8212; were clearly laid out in Fagundo's January 2 letter. Although we agree that the factual underpinnings of the accompanying allegations lacked the specificity included in the most serious allegations, we do not find that they fall below the constitutional baseline. <i>See, e.g., Brasslett v. Cota,</i> 761 F.2d 827, 836 (1st Cir.1985) (finding no due process violation even where an employee was notified of the possibility of discharge during the same \"one hour conference\" that constituted his informal hearing).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor do we see any merit in Cepero-Rivera's claims regarding his request for a continuance. At no time did Cepero-Rivera assert that he could not attend the informal hearing on the scheduled date. Rather, his request was apparently based entirely on his belief that he needed more specific facts in order to craft a defense. However, in his zeal to defend himself, Cepero-Rivera may have misunderstood the nature of a pre-termination hearing. Due process requires only that the pre-termination hearing fulfill the purpose of \"an initial check against mistaken decisions &#8212; essentially, a determination of whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the charges against the employee are true and support the proposed action.\" <i>Loudermill,</i> 470 U.S. at 545-46, 105 S.Ct. 1487. As evidenced by his own thorough written responses to the allegations against him, Cepero-Rivera was given ample notice of the bases for the termination proceedings against him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the PRHA failed to make any response to Cepero-Rivera's request for a continuance, common sense and Cepero-Rivera's own note of January 17 indicate that he knew that the hearing was still set for January 18. In fact, in that note, Cepero-Rivera stated that he was submitting his case in writing rather than appear in person at the informal hearing. <i>Cf. Mercado-Alicea v. P.R. Tourism Co.,</i> 396 F.3d 46, 53 (1st Cir.2005) (finding that where plaintiff failed to attend his informal hearing after multiple reschedulings, defendants \"did not violate [plaintiff's] due process rights when his inability to present his side of the story was due to his failure to participate\"). While it is regrettable that the PRHA did not respond to Cepero-Rivera's request for a continuance and for additional facts, we have explained that \"the Constitution requires only an initial check against erroneous decisions, not that the state follow best practices.\" <i>O'Neill v. Baker,</i> 210 F.3d 41, 49 n. 10 (1st Cir.2000). In this case, Cepero-Rivera was given an opportunity to attend an informal pre-termination hearing; he simply chose to present his arguments in writing. Due process requires nothing more from his employer at that stage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Maine, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We stress that under the<i>Mt.

Aponte,</i> 1 F.3d 62, 67 (1st Cir.1993). Under Title VII, once the plaintiff establishes a <i>prima facie</i> case, the employer need only submit enough evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact &#8212; <i>i.e.,</i> only the burden of production shifts to the employer. <i>Id.</i> However, in a First Amendment political discrimination case, in which the <i>Mt. Healthy</i> scheme is applicable, \"the burden of persuasion shifts to the defendant, [and] the plaintiff-employee will prevail unless the fact finder concludes that the defendant has produced enough evidence to establish that the plaintiff's dismissal would have occurred in any event for nondiscriminatory reasons.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Cepero-Rivera claims this notice was deficient for, among other reasons, its failure to state the time of the scheduled hearing. However, he does not claim to have made any attempt to find out the time of the hearing. In fact, it seems the first time he mentioned the failure to specify a time was in the note he wrote to Fagundo the day before the scheduled hearing, in which he stated that he would not attend. Like the district court, we assume that this information could have been easily obtained, and we do not consider its omission to be a fatal flaw in the notice provided</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Cepero-Rivera and his daughter, Jennifer Cepero-Salgado, claim that Cepero-Rivera's termination was motivated by his political affiliation in violation of his constitutional rights pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1983 &amp; 1985, and they now appeal the district court's dismissal of their claims against certain defendants, its grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant Fernando Fagundo, and its determination that the procedures followed in Cepero-Rivera's termination did not violate due process. After examining the record, we reject each of appellants' arguments, and affirm the order of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Facts</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The chain of events leading to appellant Cepero's firing began on September 24, 2001, when Cepero-Rivera wrote a letter to the former PRHA Executive Director, Fernando Fagundo, requesting a salary increase in accordance with a PRHA regulation that required a one-step pay increase for employees who had not been given a pay raise equivalent to one step in the pay scale over the preceding five years. In the letter, Cepero-Rivera also stated that he possessed a list of the salaries and fringe benefits of several recently-appointed female employees. Based on this information, he alleged gender and age discrimination, and that the salary raises given to those female employees violated the merit principle established in the PRHA Personnel Handbook.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cepero-Rivera did not receive the response he had hoped for. On January 2, 2002, Fagundo sent Cepero-Rivera a letter denying his request for a salary raise because he had received six pay raises in as many years with the PRHA. In the same letter, Fagundo informed Cepero-Rivera that he had ordered the PRHA's legal department to investigate possible violations of the Puerto Rico Penal Code and several articles of the PRHA's Disciplinary Measures Handbook, including two alleged violations of infraction 37 of the Handbook, which prohibits using confidential personnel records for personal gain. Fagundo's letter outlined the underlying facts relating to Cepero-Rivera's admitted possession of other employees' confidential information in his September letter and a previous instance in which he appended portions of defendant Howard Phillip's confidential personnel records to a memorandum about Phillip. Fagundo's letter additionally alleged insubordination and involvement in various incidents with other PRHA employees. The letter informed Cepero-Rivera of Fagundo's intentions to file disciplinary measures, which could result in dismissal, and that an informal hearing was to be held on January 18, 2002. The January 2, 2002 letter was Cepero-Rivera's first notice of defendants' intentions to take disciplinary measures against him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 10, 2002, Cepero-Rivera sent a letter to Fagundo responding to the allegations that he had misused confidential personnel records and requesting more information about the specific facts underlying the insubordination and misconduct allegations. Cepero-Rivera's request was never answered by defendants. On January 17, 2002, Cepero-Rivera sent Fagundo a handwritten note stating that the January 2 letter did not state the time of the hearing, and thus, he was handing in certain documents \"as evidence of [his] appearance in writing to the informal hearing.\" On February 22, 2002, Cepero-Rivera received a letter officially terminating his employment with the PRHA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Analysis</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants make four distinct arguments on appeal. First, appellants claim that district court erred in requiring Cepero-Rivera to present a <i>prima facie</i> case of political discrimination against Eric Ram&#237;rez-Nazario, Samuel De La Rosa, and William Vega. Second, appellants argue that the district court erred in dismissing, <i>sua sponte,</i> the claims against Harry D&#237;az-Vega, Roberto Santiago-Cancel, and Howard Phillip Figueroa. Third, appellants challenge the grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant Fernando Fagundo for failure to rebut defendants' proffered nondiscriminatory basis for Cepero-Rivera's dismissal. Finally, Cepero-Rivera argues that the procedure leading to his termination did not afford him due process of law. We address each of plaintiffs' claims in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The District Court's Misapplication of the Prima Facie Case Standard</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants contend that the district court incorrectly applied a heightened pleading standard to Ram&#237;rez's, De la Rosa's, and Vega's motion to dismiss. Although the district court in large part correctly described the motion to dismiss standard, <i>see Rivera v.

Appellees concede that appellants did not have the burden of establishing a <i>prima facie</i> case in order to survive a motion to dismiss. However, they argue that appellants nevertheless clearly failed to meet their burden under the proper Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2) standard, and thus, the ultimate decision to dismiss should be affirmed.

In this case, defendants had little difficulty laying out the nondiscriminatory reasons for Cepero-Rivera's dismissal. Defendants contend, and appellants do not deny, that Cepero-Rivera's letter of September 24 stated that he possessed a list of female employees' salaries and fringe benefits. Even viewed in the light most favorable to appellants, we cannot but conclude that this letter gave Fagundo every reason to believe that Cepero-Rivera had improperly obtained this information from personnel files in violation of PHRA regulations. Defendants also allege, and Cepero-Rivera does not deny, that he had previously attached forty-eight pages of Phillips' personnel file to a letter in which he argued that Phillips was mentally unstable &#8212; an impermissible use of confidential personnel information under PRHA regulations. In addition, defendants allege, and Cepero-Rivera does not deny, that he refused to recognize the appointment of Santiago as his direct supervisor, which defendants characterize as insubordination. Like the district court, we find that, given the seriousness of Cepero-Rivera's violations of PRHA regulations, defendants easily meet their burden of showing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Cepero-Rivera would have been dismissed regardless of his political affiliation. <i>See LaRou,</i> 98 F.3d at 661. Once Cepero-Rivera made the misstep of claiming physical possession of confidential personnel records, it is difficult to see how a supervisor in Fagundo's position could have done anything less than order an investigation, potentially resulting in the employee's dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, at this point, \"the plaintiff[s] may discredit the proffered nondiscriminatory reason, either circumstantially or directly, by adducing evidence that discrimination was more likely than not a motivating factor.\" <i>Padilla-Garc&#237;a v.

Appellants' efforts in this regard fail to convince us that discrimination was more likely than not a motivating factor in Cepero-Rivera's dismissal. Appellants offer nothing to directly undermine the credibility of the proffered nondiscriminatory reasons for Cepero-Rivera's dismissal. Their only attack on the substance of these allegations is the contention that when Cepero-Rivera said he had \"in [his] power a list of the[se] employees . . . with their salaries and fringe benefits,\" he meant only that he had a copy of the office telephone book, from which he could deduce his female employees' salaries. Even accepting Cepero-Rivera's explanation, we find that the explanation is so implausible that it should not have caused any doubt in the minds of the PRHA officials considering his termination. Having been told by Cepero-Rivera himself, when he thought it suited his interest, that he possessed a list of salaries and fringe benefits of the organization's female employees, we do not see why his employers should believe Cepero-Rivera's later explanation that he had meant only that he had made such a list himself by guessing at salary and benefits from the office phonebook, especially in light of his earlier use of portions of Phillip's confidential information. Thus, although on summary judgment we assume Cepero-Rivera's explanation to be genuine, it does not undermine defendants proffered nondiscriminatory basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their brief, appellants contend that defendants' proffered reasons for Cepero-Rivera's dismissal were \"nothing but an excuse to justify the real reason, which was politically motivated.\" However, they offer only meager evidence to support that contention. Appellants allege that Fagundo once asked Cepero-Rivera when he was leaving his position, since a new administration had taken office. However, they do not offer any evidence that this incident was anything more than a mistake as to Cepero-Rivera's status as a career employee. Nor do they assert that there was any follow-up conversation or point to other indicia of animus toward Cepero-Rivera on the part of Fagundo. Appellants also state that Phillip suggested that Cepero-Rivera should resign and leave his post to a PDP employee, and that D&#237;az suggested that Cepero-Rivera change his party affiliation to the PDP. This type of evidence can serve to show that the proffered nondiscriminatory basis for an employee's dismissal was only pretext. However, given the gravity of the charges against Cepero-Rivera, and the fact that they are based on his own admissions that he possessed confidential personnel information, this evidence fails to demonstrate that political discrimination was more likely than not a motivating factor in his dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' arguments that the charges against Cepero-Rivera were time-barred also fail to convince us that defendants' reasons for Cepero-Rivera's dismissal were mere pretext, particularly as they do not reach the primary charge of personnel file misuse. Appellants' only remaining arguments address irregular procedures followed in the course of his dismissal. However, these arguments do not relate to the grounds for Cepero-Rivera's dismissal.

In addition to responding to his request and allegations, the letter informed Cepero-Rivera: (1) that he was under investigation for possible violation of PRHA regulations, because he had used confidential personnel documents for personal benefit; (2) that Fagundo intended to file charges against him that could result in the termination of his employment; (3) that he had the right to a pre-termination hearing; and (4) that an informal hearing would take place on January 18, 2002 in the Office of the Legal Counsel's library, where he could present his version of the facts and show cause as to why disciplinary measures should not be instituted against him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> On January 10, Cepero-Rivera responded with a letter in which he answered a number of the allegations against him and requested more information about others. He also requested that the informal hearing scheduled for January 18 be continued to a later date. No one in the PRHA administration responded to this letter, and on January 17, Cepero-Rivera addressed a note to Fagundo asserting that the January 2 letter did not state the time of the hearing, and \"[t]hus, [he was] handing in these documents as evidence of [his] appearance in writing to the informal hearing.\" Cepero-Rivera did not attend the January 18 informal hearing, and on February 22, Executive Director Fagundo sent a letter officially discharging Cepero-Rivera from his position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants claims that this procedure was constitutionally deficient in a number of ways. First, appellants seem to claim that Cepero-Rivera was not provided sufficient notice of the facts underlying the allegations for which he might be dismissed. After a thorough review of the record, we find that appellants overstate this claim. At the outset, we note that the principal allegations against Cepero-Rivera related to his use of confidential personnel documents, which, in one instance, he appended to a memorandum regarding defendant Phillip and, in the other, he stated he possessed in his letter of September 24, 2001. These facts underlying the violation of the PRHA's Disciplinary Measures Handbook infraction 37 &#8212; the only infraction that defendants claim allows for termination after a single violation &#8212; were clearly laid out in Fagundo's January 2 letter. Although we agree that the factual underpinnings of the accompanying allegations lacked the specificity included in the most serious allegations, we do not find that they fall below the constitutional baseline. <i>See, e.g., Brasslett v. Cota,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"451881\"><a href=\"/opinion/451881/duane-p-brasslett-v-raymond-j-cota-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">761</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">827</span></a></span>, 836 (1st Cir.1985) (finding no due process violation even where an employee was notified of the possibility of discharge during the same \"one hour conference\" that constituted his informal hearing).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor do we see any merit in Cepero-Rivera's claims regarding his request for a continuance. At no time did Cepero-Rivera assert that he could not attend the informal hearing on the scheduled date. Rather, his request was apparently based entirely on his belief that he needed more specific facts in order to craft a defense. However, in his zeal to defend himself, Cepero-Rivera may have misunderstood the nature of a pre-termination hearing. Due process requires only that the pre-termination hearing fulfill the purpose of \"an initial check against mistaken decisions &#8212; essentially, a determination of whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the charges against the employee are true and support the proposed action.\" <i>Loudermill,</i> 470 U.S. at 545-46, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111372\"><a href=\"/opinion/111372/cleveland-bd-of-ed-v-loudermill/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

While it is regrettable that the PRHA did not respond to Cepero-Rivera's request for a continuance and for additional facts, we have explained that \"the Constitution requires only an initial check against erroneous decisions, not that the state follow best practices.\" <i>O'Neill v.

Under Title VII, once the plaintiff establishes a <i>prima facie</i> case, the employer need only submit enough evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact &#8212; <i>i.e.,</i> only the burden of production shifts to the employer. <i>Id.</i> However, in a First Amendment political discrimination case, in which the <i>Mt. Healthy</i> scheme is applicable, \"the burden of persuasion shifts to the defendant, [and] the plaintiff-employee will prevail unless the fact finder concludes that the defendant has produced enough evidence to establish that the plaintiff's dismissal would have occurred in any event for nondiscriminatory reasons.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Cepero-Rivera claims this notice was deficient for, among other reasons, its failure to state the time of the scheduled hearing. However, he does not claim to have made any attempt to find out the time of the hearing. In fact, it seems the first time he mentioned the failure to specify a time was in the note he wrote to Fagundo the day before the scheduled hearing, in which he stated that he would not attend. Like the district court, we assume that this information could have been easily obtained, and we do not consider its omission to be a fatal flaw in the notice provided</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
