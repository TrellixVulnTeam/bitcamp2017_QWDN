Defendant-appellant, Amado\n\nLópez (\"López\"), entered a conditional plea of guilty on charges of\n\nconspiring to possess cocaine and cocaine base with intent to\n\ndistribute.       See   21    U.S.C.       §§    841,    846.     On   appeal,     López\n\nchallenges an adverse ruling below on his motion to suppress\n\nevidence obtained pursuant to a wiretap warrant governed by Title\n\nIII of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968\n\n(\"Title III\"), 18 U.S.C. §§ 2510-22.               For the first time on appeal,\n\nthe   appellant    also      raises    a    constitutional        challenge   to    the\n\nsentence imposed by the district court.                  For the reasons set forth\nbelow, we reject López's arguments and affirm the rulings of the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n                                 I.    BACKGROUND\n\nA.    The conspiracy\n\n            In early April 1999, an agent of the Drug Enforcement\n\nAdministration (\"DEA\") received information from a confidential\n\nsource   indicating     that    a     cocaine      distribution        conspiracy    was\n\noperating in the area of Brunswick, Maine.                      With the help of the\n\nconfidential source, undercover DEA agents were able to contact\n\nmembers of the conspiracy directly and arrange several controlled\n\npurchases of cocaine.          The DEA was also able to gain information\nconcerning the conspiracy through other investigative techniques,\nincluding   visual      surveillance        and    pen-register        analysis.      In\n\naddition, DEA agents obtained the assistance of at least one other\n\n\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\fconfidential source who was able to identify other members of the\n\nconspiracy.\n\n            On     November    17,    1999,    the    government      applied     for\nauthorization       to    conduct    wiretaps    of     two    mobile    telephones\n\nallegedly used by members of the drug distribution ring.                        Along\n\nwith the application, DEA Agent Brian Boyle (\"Boyle\") submitted an\naffidavit describing the investigation of the drug conspiracy to\n\ndate. Boyle detailed the progress of the investigation and various\n\ninvestigative techniques that either had been tried previously or\n\nwere deemed        unlikely   to    succeed.     Based    on    the   government's\n\napplication, Chief U.S. District Judge D. Brock Hornby granted the\n\nwiretap application.          The order issued by Chief Judge Hornby\n\nprovided:\n            Wherefore, it is hereby Ordered that special\n            agents of the United States Drug Enforcement\n            Administration and other investigative and law\n            enforcement officers, assisted, if necessary,\n            by qualified translators, pursuant to the\n            application of the Assistant United States\n            Attorney Jonathan A. Toof, are authorized to\n            intercept and record wire communications to\n            and from the cellular telephone . . . assigned\n            and billed to Orlando Santana, Jr. . . . .\n            The wiretap plant was operated for approximately twenty\n\ndays.     As a result of certain subscriber changes, the order was\n\namended once during the course of the plant's operation.                       And on\n\nNovember 29 and December 7, 1999, the government filed progress\n\nreports     with    the    court     setting    forth    the    number    of    calls\n\nintercepted, samples of the types of conversations recorded, and\n\nnames of conspirators who had and had not been identified.                     See 18\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fU.S.C. § 2518(6) (providing that the authorizing judge may require\n\nthe government to submit periodic progress reports).\n\n           Ultimately, the wiretap intercepted approximately 1700\ntelephone calls.       Throughout the duration of the wiretap, the\n\ngovernment relied on the services of civilian monitors working\n\nunder contract with the government. The civilian monitors provided\nsome translation services; however, the majority of the civilians'\n\nservices   consisted     of   monitoring    all   intercepted   calls    and\n\nperforming   \"minimization\"     --   that   is,   the   implementation    of\n\nprocedures established by the government to ensure that the fewest\n\nnumber of non-pertinent (or \"innocent\") calls are intercepted. See\n\n18 U.S.C. § 2518(5) (providing for a minimization requirement in\n\nany order approving or extending a wiretap warrant).\n           Based on the information obtained through the wiretap,\n\nthe government was able to build a formidable case against the\n\nconspiracy members.      According to the appellant, a number of the\nintercepted telephone calls were particularly incriminating to him.\n\nB.   Proceedings below\n\n           López was indicted and charged together with seventeen\nother co-conspirators. Count I of the indictment charged López and\n\nthe other defendants with a conspiracy to possess with intent to\ndistribute cocaine and cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C.\n§§ 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A), and 846.         The remaining counts of the\n\nseven-count indictment pertained to conspirators other than López.\nThe case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Gene Carter.\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f            López, joined by most of the other defendants, moved to\n\nsuppress the evidence gathered by the wiretap. López argued below:\n\n1)   that   there    was    no   probable     cause   to   issue    the   wiretap\nauthorization; 2) that the government failed to demonstrate in its\n\napplication        for     wiretap     authorization       that    conventional\n\ninvestigative       techniques       were   ineffective;    and    3)   that   the\ngovernment failed to properly minimize the interception of the\n\ntelephone calls.         Judge Carter denied López's initial motion to\n\nsuppress, but raised concerns in his written decision about the\n\ngovernment's use of civilian monitors to conduct the minimization.\n\nSee United States v. López, No. Crim. 99-79-P-V, 2000 WL 761977\n\n(D. Me. April 28, 2000).             Judge Carter then invited all of the\n\ndefendants to file additional motions to suppress for the purpose\nof addressing this issue.              López did so and argued that the\n\ngovernment's use of civilian monitors exceeded the scope of the\n\noriginal wiretap authorization and, as a consequence, resulted in\nimproper minimization of calls to the targeted phones.                  After this\n\nadditional round of briefing, Judge Carter denied the motion to\n\nsuppress.    See    United States v. López, 106 F. Supp. 2d 92 (D. Me.\n\n2000).\n\n            Following the denial of the motion, López entered a\n\nconditional plea of guilty, preserving for appeal the admissibility\n\nof the wiretap evidence.         Judge Carter then sentenced López to 240\n\nmonths in prison.        This timely appeal followed.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\f                                II.    TITLE III\n\n            By enacting Title III, Congress sought to protect the\n\nprivacy of wire and oral communications while, at the same time,\n\nauthorizing the use of electronic surveillance evidence obtained by\n\nlaw enforcement under specified conditions.                    See Bartnicki v.\n\nVopper, 532 U.S. 514, 523 (2001).              In accordance with Congress's\n\nconcern for preserving privacy, Title III makes the interception of\n\nelectronic    communications     by     law   enforcement         an   extraordinary\n\ninvestigative    technique      whose    use    \"is     to   be    distinctly       the\n\nexception -- not the rule.\"            United States v. Hoffman, 832 F.2d\n1299, 1306 (1st Cir. 1987).           The statute thus imposes a number of\n\nstrict requirements on the issuance and use of wiretap warrants.\nSee United States v. Giordano, 416 U.S. 505, 515 (1974).\n\n            At the outset, a duly-authorized law enforcement officer\n\nmust obtain approval from the Attorney General of the United States\nor a specially designated assistant attorney general in order to\napply to a federal judge for a wiretap.               See 18 U.S.C. § 2516(1).\n\nOnce such approval is obtained, the officer must present a written\napplication for a wiretap to the judge.                      Before issuing the\nwiretap, the judge must make certain enumerated findings and issue\n\nan ex parte order containing specified elements.                       See 18 U.S.C.\n§ 2518(1), (3)-(4).\n            In the application for the wiretap, the government must\n\nmake   a   detailed   proffer    including:       (a)    the      identity    of    the\ninvestigative or law enforcement officer making the application,\n\nand the    officer    authorizing      the    application;        (b)    a   full   and\n\n                                        -6-\n\fcomplete statement of the facts and circumstances justifying the\n\napplicant's belief that an order should be issued;1 (c) a full and\n\ncomplete   statement   as   to    whether   or    not   other   investigative\nprocedures have been tried and failed or why they appear to be too\n\ndangerous or unlikely to succeed if tried; (d) a statement of the\n\nperiod of time for which the interception is required to be\nmaintained; and (e) a full and complete statement of the facts\n\nconcerning all previous applications involving any of the same\n\npersons, facilities, or places specified in the application.               See\n\n18 U.S.C. § 2518(1)(a)-(e).\n\n           Finally, in the event the application is granted, Title\n\nIII provides numerous grounds upon which communications obtained\n\npursuant   to   a   Title   III   warrant   may    be   suppressed    in   any\nproceeding.     Specifically, the statute states:\n\n           Any aggrieved person in any trial, hearing, or\n           proceeding in or before any court, department,\n           officer, agency, regulatory body, or other\n           authority of the United States, a State, or a\n           political subdivision thereof, may move to\n           suppress the contents of any wire or oral\n           communication intercepted pursuant to this\n           chapter, or evidence derived therefrom, on the\n           grounds that -- (i) the communication was\n           unlawfully intercepted; (ii) the order or\n           authorization or approval under which it was\n           intercepted is insufficient on its face; or\n           (iii) the interception was not made in\n\n1\n    The government's statement of the facts and circumstances\njustifying its belief that an order should be issued must include:\ndetails as to the particular offense that has been, is being, or is\nabout to be committed; a description of the nature and location of\nthe facilities from which the communication is to be intercepted;\na description of the type of communications sought to be\nintercepted; and the identity of the person committing the offense\nand whose communications are to be intercepted.      See 18 U.S.C.\n§ 2518(1)(b)(i)-(iv).\n\n                                    -7-\n\f               conformity with the order of authorization or\n               approval . . . .\nId. § 2518(10)(a).\n\n               López makes sundry arguments as to why the incriminating\n\ncommunications intercepted by the government must be suppressed.\nHe argues first that the government's application was inadequate on\n\nits face to satisfy the so-called \"necessity requirement\" of Title\n\nIII.    See id. § 2518(1)(c).       López also argues that the government\n\nneglected to disclose its intention to use civilian monitors and,\n\ntherefore, that its subsequent use of such monitors violates Title\n\nIII and compels the suppression of the intercepted calls.                  Lastly,\n\nLópez raises challenges to the monitor's minimization efforts and\nthe supervision of the monitors by government agents.                We address\n\neach of López's arguments in turn.\n\nA.     The \"necessity requirement\"\n\n               Title III requires that a wiretap application include \"a\n\nfull     and    complete   statement    as    to    whether    or    not     other\ninvestigative procedures have been tried and failed or why they\nreasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too\n\ndangerous.\"        Hoffman,   832    F.2d    at    1306   (quoting   18    U.S.C.\n\n§ 2518(1)(c)); see also United States v. Kahn, 415 U.S. 143, 153\nn.12 (1974) (noting that the necessity requirement was \"designed to\n\nassure that wiretapping is not resorted to in situations where\ntraditional investigative techniques would suffice to expose the\ncrime\").       In order to satisfy this requirement of necessity, the\n\ngovernment must demonstrate that it has made \"a reasonable, good\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\ffaith effort to run the gamut of normal investigative procedures\n\nbefore resorting to means so intrusive as electronic interception\n\nof telephone calls.\"       Hoffman, 832 F.2d at 1306-07.             However, the\nnecessity     requirement    is     not     tantamount    to    an     exhaustion\n\nrequirement.    See United States v. Edwards, 69 F.3d 419, 429 (10th\n\nCir. 1995) (\"[L]aw enforcement officials are not required to\nexhaust all     other   conceivable       investigative   procedures      before\n\nresorting to wiretapping.\") (citations and quotations omitted); see\n\nalso United States v. David, 940 F.2d 722, 728-29 (1st Cir. 1991)\n\n(holding that necessity was shown           even though government had not\n\nattempted to use search warrants, pen registers, or undercover\n\nagents). Consequently, Title III does not \"force the government to\n\nrun outlandish risks . . . before seeking a wiretap.\"                Hoffman, 832\nF.2d at 1306.\n\n             In reviewing the sufficiency of the government's showing\n\nof necessity, the \"'appeals court role is not to make a de novo\n\ndetermination of sufficiency as if it were [the issuing judge], but\n\nto decide if the facts set forth in the application were minimally\n\nadequate to support the determination that was made.'\"                     United\n\nStates v. Ashley, 876 F.2d 1069, 1074 (1st Cir. 1989) (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Scibelli, 549 F.2d 222, 226 (1st Cir. 1977)).\n\nThat is, \"[t]he sufficiency of the affidavit is to be upheld where\n\nthe appellate court determines that the issuing court could have\n\nreasonably     concluded     that    normal      investigatory        procedures\n\nreasonably appeared to be unlikely to succeed.\"                Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\f              López       argues    that     the    government's        application        was\n\ninsufficient on its face.                   He characterizes the government's\n\naffidavit in support of the application as largely composed of\nconclusory assertions devoid of factual specificity.                               He also\n\ncontends that the application reveals that the government failed to\n\nutilize some investigative avenues that still remained open.\n              To be sure, the government's affidavit must show with\n\nspecificity         why       ordinary    means     of     investigation       will    fail;\n\nconclusory statements without factual support are not sufficient.\n\nSee    18    U.S.C.       §    2518(1)(c)    (requiring       a   \"full    and    complete\n\nstatement\"); see also United States v. Castillo-García, 117 F.3d\n\n1179, 1194 (10th Cir. 1997) (\"[G]eneralities, or statements in the\n\nconclusory language of the statute, are insufficient to support a\nwiretap application.\").              But in this case, we are satisfied that\n\nthe government's application was more than minimally adequate to\n\npersuade      the     issuing      judge    that      the    warrant    was    reasonably\nnecessary.      It would be de trop for us to reiterate the analysis of\n\nJudge Carter in the court below, which we find to be both thorough\n\nand well reasoned, so we shall confine ourselves to some key\n\nobservations.\n\n              The     affidavit      of    DEA     Agent    Boyle   described      several\n\nalternative        investigative          techniques       that   had   been     tried     and\n\nfailed, appeared unlikely to succeed, might alert the conspirators,\n\nor    were   too     dangerous       to    pursue.2         Although    several       of   the\n\n2\n    Specifically, Agent Boyle listed six such techniques: 1)\nphysical surveillance; 2) grand jury subpoenas; 3) undercover drug\npurchases; 4) pen registers; 5) trap-and-trace devices; and 6)\n\n                                             -10-\n\ftechniques    (such   as    physical      surveillance,       interrogation        of\n\ninformants,     pen-register        analysis,    and    controlled         buys    by\n\nundercover agents) had proven valuable in the past, the utility of\nthose tools was exhausted or greatly diminished by the time the\n\ngovernment sought its warrant.\n\n             As the details of Agent Boyle's affidavit demonstrate,\nthe traditional techniques employed by the DEA over the course of\n\nseveral months      had    failed    to   establish    the    identity     of     some\n\nconspirators, particularly those at the top of the distribution\n\nchain.    See United States v. Díaz, 176 F.3d 52, 110-11 (2d Cir.\n\n1999)    (holding   that    necessity     for   wiretap      was   shown    because\n\ntraditional techniques were not adequate to reveal sources of drug\n\nsupply and location of drug proceeds); United States v. Cooper, 868\nF.2d 1505, 1509-10 (6th Cir. 1989) (holding that necessity for\n\nwiretap was shown because wiretap followed lengthy investigation in\n\nwhich normal investigative procedures were used extensively but had\nnot identified customers and agents of prescription drug ring).\n\nMoreover, the affidavit documents specific incidents suggesting\n\nthat the further use of surveillance and undercover operations\n\nrisked revealing the investigation and placing law enforcement\n\nofficers in harm's way.         For example, one conspirator expressed\n\n\n\nsearch warrants. Cf. United States v. VanMeter, 278 F.3d 1156,\n1153-64 (10th Cir. 2002) (noting that normal investigative\nprocedures subject to 18 U.S.C. § 2518(1)(c) include: 1) standard\nvisual and aural surveillance; 2) questioning and interrogation of\nwitnesses or participants (including the use of grand juries and\nthe grant of immunity if necessary); 3) use of search warrants; 4)\ninfiltration of conspiratorial groups by undercover agents; and 5)\nuse of pen registers and trap-and-trace devices).\n\n                                      -11-\n\fconcern to an undercover agent about the \"heat\" in the area.\n\nMonths later, the same conspirator refused to speak to or deal with\n\nthe agent.     One of the government's cooperating witnesses was also\nquestioned by conspiracy members as to whether he was in league\n\nwith the authorities.       And the affidavit points to other instances\n\nwhere the conspirators engaged in counter-surveillance designed to\navoid detection by law enforcement. See United States v. Williams,\n\n124    F.3d   411,   418   (3d   Cir.    1997)   (necessity   shown   because\n\ngovernment had been unable to use a confidential informant without\n\nhigh risk of discovery, and co-conspirators used evasive techniques\n\nsuch    as    electronic   detection       equipment);   United   States   v.\n\nCarrazana, 921 F.2d 1557, 1564-65 (11th Cir. 1991) (necessity for\n\nwiretap shown because other investigative methods were unsuccessful\ndue to drug ring's counter-surveillance protection).\n\n              Other investigative techniques that were not tried by the\n\ngovernment were also inadequate because they might have revealed\nthe ongoing investigation.        The execution of a search warrant or\n\nissuance of grand jury subpoenas would have likely alerted other\n\nconspiracy members to law enforcement's investigation.                  Also,\n\nalthough López suggests that a handful of cooperating sources\n\n(including two active conspiracy members who had been arrested\n\nduring the course of the investigation) could have provided useful\n\ngrand jury testimony, we think the issuing judge would have been\n\njustified in doubting the efficacy of such action.            As Agent Boyle\n\nstates in his affidavit, two of the cooperating sources had limited\n\ninformation concerning the full scope of the conspiracy, and\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\fcalling other cooperating sources before the grand jury could\n\narouse the suspicions of others.\n\n          Viewed as a whole, the information contained in the\ngovernment's application for the Title III warrant was not, as\n\nLópez suggests, mere boilerplate.          Nor were the circumstances\n\nsurrounding the government's investigation of the drug conspiracy\nso commonplace or generic that our approval of the issuance of the\n\nwarrant in this case would assure that a warrant could be issued in\n\nvirtually any drug investigation.         The government provided the\n\nissuing judge with specific factors -- particularly the DEA's\n\ninability to identify key conspiracy members and the conspiracy's\n\ngrowing awareness of law enforcement activity -- that militated in\n\nfavor of using a more drastic investigative tool.          We therefore\naffirm the district court's ruling that the government's warrant\n\napplication satisfied Title III's necessity requirement.\n\nB.   Civilian monitors\n\n           López   argues   next   that   the   communications   must   be\n\nsuppressed because the government violated Title III by failing to\ndisclose to the issuing judge that civilian monitors would be\nutilized during the interception process.        Although we agree with\n\nLópez that the government must disclose its intention to use\ncivilian monitors, we do not find the failure to do so in this case\nto be sufficient grounds to suppress the communications.\n\n           There is no doubt that the use of civilian monitors for\nthe execution of a wiretap cannot constitute a per se violation of\n\nTitle III, since the statute explicitly contemplates the assistance\n\n                                   -13-\n\fof civilian personnel.       Specifically, Title III provides, in\n\nrelevant part: \"An interception under this chapter may be conducted\n\nin whole or in part by Government personnel, or by an individual\noperating under a contract with the Government, acting under the\n\nsupervision   of   an   investigative   or   law   enforcement      officer\n\nauthorized to conduct the interception.\"           18 U.S.C. § 2518(5).\nNevertheless, Title III generally places a burden of \"full and\n\ncomplete\" disclosure on the government in its application for a\n\nwiretap, see id. § 2518(1)(b),(c) & (d), and the issuing judge is\n\nobliged to craft the order approving the wiretap with specificity,\n\nsee id. § 2518(4). These provisions necessitate candor on the part\n\nof the government -- a candor that, in our view, would generally be\n\nundermined if the government could withhold important information\nabout the manner in which the wiretap will be conducted.\n\n           The government's failure to disclose its plans to use\n\ncivilian monitors frustrates the objectives of other provisions of\nTitle III as well.      For example, the statute mandates that the\n\nissuing judge include in any order a provision requiring that the\n\nwiretap be conducted in such a way as to minimize nonpertinent\n\ncommunications.    See id. § 2518(5).    If the issuing judge is kept\n\nignorant of the manner in which the government intends to execute\n\nthe wiretap, this diminishes the judge's ability to craft an order\n\nthat is sufficiently protective of the minimization requirement.\n\nIn addition, the statute permits the issuing judge to require\n\nstatus   reports   showing   \"what   progress   has   been   made    toward\n\nachievement of the authorized objective and the need for continued\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\finterception.\" Id. § 2518(6). Yet, without information on how the\n\ncalls are being intercepted, and by what personnel, the judge's\n\nimpression of the progress of the wiretap may be mistaken.\n           In light of these considerations, we hold that the\n\ngovernment must disclose, as a part of its application for a\n\nwiretap warrant, any intention to utilize the services of civilian\nmonitors in the execution of the warrant. To hold otherwise would,\n\nin our view, run counter to the general duty of candor the statute\n\nimposes on the government and impair the issuing judge's ability to\n\npreserve important privacy interests protected by Title III.\n\n           Having established that Title III requires the government\n\nto provide the issuing judge with information on any plans to\n\nemploy civilian monitors, we turn to the question of whether the\ngovernment's    conduct    in   this     particular    case    requires     the\n\nsuppression of the communications that incriminate López.                 Title\n\nIII sets out a broadly-worded statutory exclusion rule that, on its\nface, prohibits the use at trial of any evidence \"derived from\" a\n\nwiretap   \"if   the   disclosure    of   that    information   would   be    in\n\nviolation of this chapter.\"        Id. § 2515.    The government's failure\n\nto disclose its intention to use civilian monitors, which violates\n\nan obligation under Title III, thus lays the foundation for a\n\nmotion to suppress.3\n\n3\n   The district court separated its analysis of suppression into\ntwo categories, reasoning that the failure to disclose provided\ngrounds for suppression 18 U.S.C. § 2518(10)(a)(i) (providing for\nsuppression of communications that are \"unlawfully intercepted\"),\nwhile the resulting failure of the warrant to authorize civilian\nmonitors might give rise to a suppression motion under 18 U.S.C.\n§   2518(10)(a)(iii)  (providing   for  suppression   where  \"the\n\n                                    -15-\n\f            Despite the broad language of § 2515, \"it is well-settled\n\nthat not    every      failure    to   comply    fully     with    any     requirement\n\nprovided in Title III necessitates suppression.\"                   United States v.\n\nEscobar-De Jesús, 187 F.3d 148, 171 (1st Cir. 1999); see United\n\nStates v. Donovan, 429 U.S. 413, 432-34 (1977); United States v.\n\nChavez,    416   U.S.    562,    571-79      (1974).     A    court   evaluating     a\nsuppression motion must consider whether the underlying violation\n\nof Title III frustrated the protective purpose of that statute in\n\na particular case.            Thus, \"violations of even . . . central\n\nrequirements     do     not     mandate      suppression      if    the    government\n\ndemonstrates to the court's satisfaction that the statutory purpose\n\nhas been    achieved     despite       the    violation.\"         United    States v.\n\nCunningham, 113 F.3d 289, 293-94 (1st Cir. 1997) (quoting United\n\nStates v. Johnson, 696 F.2d 115, 121 (D.C. Cir. 1982)).                       Without\n\ntrivializing the nature of the violation in this case, we find that\n\nthe wiretap      was    conducted      in    manner    that   preserved      the   core\nprotective purposes of Title III.\n\n            The restrictions in Title III aim to limit the use of\nwiretapping to those situations where it is truly justified, and to\n\nprotect privacy as mush as reasonably possible when wiretapping is\n\nused.   See Escobar-De Jesús, 187 F.3d at 171.                The undisclosed use\n\nof civilian monitors did not affect the likelihood that the wiretap\n\nwould be authorized in the first place, nor did it increase the\n\n\ninterception was not made in conformity with the order of\nauthorization or approval\"). See López, 106 F. Supp. 2d at 97-98.\nBecause our suppression analysis evaluates the same factors and\nreaches the same conclusion on both of these arguably distinct\ngrounds, we consider them together.\n\n                                          -16-\n\fwiretap's intrusion on privacy interests.           The principal purposes\n\nof Title III were not frustrated by the violations here.\n\n          In addition, the district court's unchallenged findings\ndemonstrate that, aside from the failure to disclose the use of\n\ncivilian monitors, the wiretap was conducted in an admirably\n\nprofessional manner.         Privacy concerns were protected to the\ngreatest extent    possible.       Suppression      is   less    likely    to   be\n\nnecessary when the violation of Title III represents an isolated\n\nflaw in \"a process that in all other important respects complied\n\nwith the statute.\"    Cunnignham, 113 F.3d at 294.\n\n          Finally, there is no indication that the government's\n\nviolations of Title III were willful or knowing.               We are the first\n\ncourt of appeals to hold that Title III requires the government to\ndisclose any plans to employ civilian monitors; indeed, we appear\n\nto be the first court that has been squarely presented with the\n\nissue.   Thus, the law enforcement in this case presumably did not\nrealize that their undisclosed use of civilian monitors could\n\nconstitute   a   violation    of   the   statute.        The    district   court\n\ndetermined that, although the used of civilian monitors departed\n\nfrom the precise terms of the order authorizing the wiretap, \"the\n\nviolation was inadvertent, as opposed to a conscious decision by\n\nthe Government or law enforcement officers to take action they knew\n\nto be contrary to an intercept order.\"         López, 106 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n100.\n\n          In sum, Title III imposes an obligation on the government\n\nto disclose to the issuing judge any plans to use civilian monitors\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fin the execution of a wiretap warrant.                  In the case at hand,\n\nhowever, the government's failure to make that disclosure, along\n\nwith the government's seeming violation of an order that did not\npermit the use of civilian monitors, does not provide a valid basis\n\nfor suppressing the intercepted communications.\n\nC.    Miscellaneous issues\n\n            López offers two remaining arguments as to why the\n\nintercepted communications should be suppressed.                  We think both\n\narguments lack merit and address them only briefly.\n\n            First, López contends that the government violated the\nrequirement that civilian monitors conducting an interception must\n\nbe \"supervis[ed]\" by an \"investigative or law enforcement officer\nauthorized to conduct the interception.\"                18 U.S.C. § 2518(5).\nEven     assuming    that    a    violation   of    this    requirement    could\n\nconceivably provide the basis for a motion to suppress, López's\nargument in this case is sunk by the findings of the district\ncourt.\n\n            According to the opinion below, the civilian monitors,\nwho worked sixteen-hour shifts every day for twenty days, were\nsupervised at all times by a shift supervisor.                  The one apparent\n\nexception was a single instance where the supervising agent left\nthe    plant   for     ten   to    fifteen    minutes      to   conduct   routine\nsurveillance.        López does not appear to challenge Judge Carter's\n\nfindings as clearly erroneous.          See United States v. Hawkins, 279\n\nF.3d 83, 85 (1st Cir. 2002) (\"[W]e review the factual findings of\n\nthe district court for clear error.\").             Instead he argues that, as\n\n                                       -18-\n\fa matter of law, the single lapse of supervision taints all of the\n\nintercepted communications.         We disagree, and think that such a de\n\nminimis departure from the supervision standard is no basis for\nexcluding the communications.            This is especially so where, as\n\nhere, López makes no attempt to identify any prejudice arising from\n\nthe interception of communications that might have occurred during\nthe brief unsupervised period.\n\n           Second, López argues that the civilian monitors were\n\nineffective at minimizing non-pertinent calls, as is required by\n\n18 U.S.C. § 2518(5).         The minimization requirement \"spotlights the\n\ninterest in confining intrusions as narrowly as possible so as not\n\nto trench impermissibly upon the personal lives and privacy of\n\nwiretap targets and those who, often innocently, come into contact\nwith such suspects.\"          Hoffman, 832 F.2d at 1307.      When fulfilling\n\nits obligation to minimize unauthorized communications, \"'[t]he\n\ngovernment is held to a standard of honest effort; perfection is\nusually not attainable, and is certainly not legally required.'\"\n\nUnited States v. Charles, 213 F.3d 10, 22 (1st Cir.) (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Uribe, 890 F.2d 554, 557 (1st Cir. 1989)), cert.\n\ndenied,   531   U.S.    915    (2000).    In    examining    the   government's\n\nadherence to this standard, we look at several factors, including:\n\n1) the nature and complexity of the suspected crimes; 2) the\n\nthoroughness    of     the    government's     precautions   to    bring   about\n\nminimization; and 3) the degree of judicial supervision over the\n\nsurveillance process.          See United States v. London, 66 F.3d 1227,\n\n1236 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\f           Judged by these criteria, the government's minimization\n\nefforts in this case far exceeded what was required; indeed, its\n\nperformance    bordered   on   perfection.      The    wiretap   intercepted\napproximately 1700 calls.        Of that large number, López and his co-\n\ndefendants    could   identify    only   six   calls   that   arguably     were\n\nunrelated to the drug conspiracy.          This amounts to only 0.35% of\nthe total number of calls intercepted.          Furthermore, the district\n\ncourt analyzed the six challenged calls and found as a fact,\n\nunchallenged in this appeal, that only two of them were improperly\n\nminimized.    Thus, the sum total of impermissibly intercepted calls\n\nwas a mere 0.11% of the total calls.        López, 2000 WL 761977, at *9.\n\n           Although     \"blind     reliance     on     the    percentage    of\n\nnonpertinent calls intercepted is not a sure guide\" to determining\nwhether the minimization was proper, Scott v. United States, 436\n\nU.S. 128, 140 (1978), the nearly flawless performance of the\n\ngovernment in this case carries significant weight.               Cf. United\n\nStates v. Bennett, 219 F.3d 1117, 1124 (9th Cir.) (minimization\n\nrequirement met where improperly intercepted calls accounted for\n\nonly 3.65% of 7322 total intercepted calls), cert. denied, 531 U.S.\n\n1056 (2000).    Plus, the findings of the district court support the\n\nconclusion that the government established and observed thorough\n\nprecautions to bring about minimization and that there was a\n\nsignificant degree of judicial supervision over the surveillance\n\nprocess.     See London, 66 F.3d at 1236.       Finally, as the district\n\ncourt found, López was not prejudiced in any way by the improper\n\nminimization of the two calls.        The district court's decision not\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\fto suppress the communications was therefore justified in all\n\nrespects.\n\n                           III.    SENTENCING\n\n            Forging ahead pro se, López challenges the 240-month\n\nsentence imposed by the district court as violative of the Supreme\n\nCourt's decision in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000).4\n\nBecause   we   conclude   that   López    voluntarily   relinquished   his\n\nApprendi arguments below, we affirm the sentence imposed by the\ndistrict court.\n\n            The indictment under which López was charged alleged that\nhe was subject to the penalty provisions of 21 U.S.C. § 841\n\n(b)(1)(A) (providing for a maximum sentence of life). However, the\nindictment, which was issued pre-Apprendi, did not specify a drug\n\nquantity. After Apprendi was decided, the government agreed not to\n\nseek a new indictment that alleged a drug amount and to limit\nLópez's sentence exposure to 20 years.\n            The flawed indictment became a well-worn topic in the\n\ndistrict court during the sentencing proceedings.          On October 3,\n2000, after hearings and rulings on suppression motions, López\nappeared, with counsel, to enter a plea of guilty.            When asked\n\nwhether he was pleading guilty because he was guilty and for no\n\n\n\n4\n    The central teaching of Apprendi is that the Fourteenth\nAmendment right to due process and the Sixth Amendment right to\ntrial by jury require that \"'any fact (other than prior conviction)\nthat increases the maximum penalty for a crime must be charged in\nan indictment, submitted to a jury, and proven beyond a reasonable\ndoubt.'\" 530 U.S. at 476 (quoting Jones v. United States, 526 U.S.\n227, 243 n.6 (1999)).\n\n                                   -21-\n\fother reason, López responded, \"I have another reason . . . [t]he\n\nApprendi case.\"     At this point, defense counsel interjected, \"What\n\nI have told [López] . . . is that it is my belief that . . .\nApprendi can only allow for a sentence up to 20 years . . . .\"\n\nJudge   Carter     conceded   the    irregularity   but   noted   that    the\n\ngovernment stood ready to re-charge López under an indictment that\nspecified a drug quantity.          Judge Carter also pointed out that a\n\nsuperceding indictment could increase the maximum sentence exposure\n\nbeyond 240 months.       Defense counsel then admitted that he had\n\nadvised López \"from a strategic standpoint\" that it was in his best\n\ninterest to plead guilty before the government could take such\n\naction.\n\n            After this discussion, the court again asked López if he\nwas pleading guilty because he was guilty.          López replied that he\n\nwas.    The court then asked, \"Is the only other reason you have to\n\ntender this plea, your desire to limit exposure to the length of\nthe period    of    incarceration?\"      López   replied,   \"yes.\"       After\n\nexplaining to López the rights that he surrendered by pleading\n\nguilty, Judge Carter ascertained that López understood and waived\n\nthese rights.      López was then sentenced to 240 months in prison.\n\n            For the first time on appeal, López now argues that his\n\nsentence violated Apprendi because the government was derelict in\n\nits duty to charge a drug quantity in the indictment.         Finding that\n\n\n\n\n                                      -22-\n\fthis   case    presents   one   of   the    clearest   examples   of   waiver\n\nimaginable, we reject López's entreaty.5\n\n              A party's mere forfeiture, or failure to timely assert a\nright, does not preclude appellate review for \"plain error\" under\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b), but a waiver of a right\n\nbars even this highly deferential form of scrutiny.               See United\n\nStates v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 733 (1993); see also United States\n\nv. Lemmerer, 277 F.3d 579, 591 n.4 (1st Cir. 2002).           In order for\n\nus to find waiver, the party must have made an \"'intentional\n\nrelinquishment or abandonment'\" of a known right. United States v.\n\nMitchell, 85 F.3d 800, 807 (1st Cir. 1996) (quoting Olano, 507 U.S.\n\nat 733).\n\n              In this case, there is no doubt that López was well aware\nthat Apprendi carried implications for his case.           As López stated\n\nduring the plea colloquy, his attorney had advised him to plead\n\nguilty under the present indictment precisely because of the effect\nof Apprendi.      Judge Carter also apprised López of the potential\n\nApprendi issue.     Indeed, Judge Carter guaranteed that the sentence\n\n\n5\n   López also appears to argue that absence of a drug quantity\nelement in the indictment deprived the district court of\njurisdiction and requires the vacatur of his sentence.         This\nargument is foreclosed by the Supreme Court's recent decision in\nUnited States v. Cotton, 122 S. Ct. 1781 (2002).       Addressing a\ndefendant's conviction under of 21 U.S.C. §§ 846 and 841(a)(1), the\nCourt in Cotton unanimously held that the failure of the government\nto include a drug quantity in the indictment was not a\njurisdictional defect that deprived a federal court of the power to\nimpose a sentence. See 122 S. Ct. at 1785. Instead, the Court\nfound that a sentence based on an indictment lacking a specific\ndrug quantity would be reviewed for \"plain error.\" Id. Since we\nfind no valid claim of error to review, López's jurisdictional\nargument is a non-starter.\n\n                                     -23-\n\fimposed would be consistent with Apprendi, and stated that he would\n\nallow López to withdraw his guilty plea and proceed to trial if a\n\nsentence in excess of 20 years were handed down.6     When the 20-year\nsentence was announced, López did not object or seek to withdraw\n\nhis plea.\n\n            Furthermore,   López    gained   a   valuable   benefit   by\nacquiescing to the charges in the original indictment.         As noted\n\nabove, the government was prepared to seek a superseding indictment\n\nwith a specific drug quantity.      Had the government done so, López\n\nwould have doubtlessly faced a harsher sentence.      For this reason,\n\nLópez's counsel recognized that, \"from a strategic standpoint,\"\n\nLópez was better off pleading guilty to the original indictment.\n\nLópez also admitted that his plea was based in part on his desire\nto limit his exposure for purposes of sentencing. López cannot now\n\nappeal what he earlier used as a pawn to better his situation.\n\n            Because López knowingly and voluntarily relinquished any\nappeal stemming from the Supreme Court's decision in Apprendi (and\n\n\n\n\n6\n  The sentence imposed by the district court insured that, even if\nLópez's belated Apprendi arguments could be reviewed for \"plain\nerror,\" see Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b), there is simply no \"error\" to\ncorrect.

On appeal, L&#243;pez challenges an adverse ruling below on his motion to suppress evidence obtained pursuant to a wiretap warrant governed by Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (\"Title III\"), 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2510-22. For the first time on appeal, the appellant also raises a constitutional challenge to the sentence imposed by the district court. For the reasons set forth below, we reject L&#243;pez's arguments and affirm the rulings of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The conspiracy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early April 1999, an agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") received information from a confidential source indicating that a cocaine distribution conspiracy was operating in the area of Brunswick, Maine. With the help of the confidential source, undercover DEA agents were able to contact members of the conspiracy directly and arrange several controlled purchases of cocaine. The DEA was also able to gain information concerning the conspiracy through other investigative techniques, including visual surveillance and pen-register analysis. In addition, DEA agents obtained the assistance of at least one other confidential source who was able to identify other members of the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 17, 1999, the government applied for authorization to conduct wiretaps of two mobile telephones allegedly used by members of the drug distribution ring. Along with the application, DEA Agent Brian Boyle (\"Boyle\") submitted an affidavit describing the investigation of the drug conspiracy to date. Boyle detailed the progress of the investigation and various investigative techniques that either had been tried previously or were deemed unlikely to succeed. Based on the government's application, Chief U.S. District Judge D. Brock Hornby granted the wiretap application. The order issued by Chief Judge Hornby provided:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wherefore, it is hereby Ordered that special agents of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration and other investigative and law enforcement officers, assisted, if necessary, by qualified translators, pursuant to the application of the Assistant United States Attorney Jonathan A. Toof, are authorized to intercept and record wire communications to and from the cellular telephone ... assigned and billed to Orlando Santana, Jr.....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The wiretap plant was operated for approximately twenty days. As a result of certain subscriber changes, the order was amended once during the course of the plant's operation. And on November 29 and December 7, 1999, the government filed progress reports with the court setting forth the number of calls intercepted, samples of the types of conversations recorded, and names of conspirators who had and had not been identified. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2518(6) (providing that the authorizing judge may require the government to submit periodic progress reports).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately, the wiretap intercepted approximately 1700 telephone calls. Throughout the duration of the wiretap, the government relied on the services of civilian monitors working under contract with the government. The civilian monitors provided some translation services; however, the majority of the civilians' services consisted of monitoring all intercepted calls and performing \"minimization\" &#8212; that is, the implementation of procedures established by the government to ensure that the fewest number of non-pertinent (or \"innocent\") calls are intercepted. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2518(5) (providing for a minimization requirement in any order approving or extending a wiretap warrant).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the information obtained through the wiretap, the government was able to build a formidable case against the conspiracy members. According to the appellant, a number of the intercepted telephone calls were particularly incriminating to him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Proceedings below</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">L&#243;pez was indicted and charged together with seventeen other co-conspirators. Count I of the indictment charged L&#243;pez and the other defendants with a conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A), and 846. The remaining counts of the seven-count indictment pertained to conspirators other than L&#243;pez. The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Gene Carter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">L&#243;pez, joined by most of the other defendants, moved to suppress the evidence gathered by the wiretap. L&#243;pez argued below: 1) that there was no probable cause to issue the wiretap authorization; 2) that the government failed to demonstrate in its application for wiretap authorization that conventional investigative techniques were ineffective; and 3) that the government failed to properly minimize the interception of the telephone calls. Judge Carter denied L&#243;pez's initial motion to suppress, but raised concerns in his written decision about the government's use of civilian monitors to conduct the minimization. <i>See United States v. L&#243;pez,</i> No.Crim. 99-79-P-V, 2000 WL 761977 (D.Me. April 28, 2000). Judge Carter then invited all of the defendants to file additional motions to suppress for the purpose of addressing this issue. L&#243;pez did so and argued that the government's use of civilian monitors exceeded the scope of the original wiretap authorization and, as a consequence, resulted in improper minimization of calls to the targeted phones. After this additional round of briefing, Judge Carter denied the motion to suppress. <i>See United States v. L&#243;pez,</i> 106 F.Supp.2d 92 (D.Me.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the denial of the motion, L&#243;pez entered a conditional plea of guilty, preserving for appeal the admissibility of the wiretap evidence. Judge Carter then sentenced L&#243;pez to 240 months in prison. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. TITLE III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By enacting Title III, Congress sought to protect the privacy of wire and oral communications while, at the same time, authorizing the use of electronic surveillance evidence obtained by law enforcement under specified conditions. <i>See Bartnicki v. Vopper,</i> 532 U.S. 514, 523, 121 S.Ct. 1753, 149 L.Ed.2d 787 (2001). In accordance with Congress's concern for preserving privacy, Title III makes the interception of electronic communications by law enforcement an extraordinary investigative technique whose use \"is to be distinctly the exception &#8212; not the rule.\" <i>United States v. Hoffman,</i> 832 F.2d 1299, 1306 (1st Cir.1987). The statute thus imposes a number of strict requirements on the issuance and use of wiretap warrants. <i>See United States v. Giordano,</i> 416 U.S. 505, 515, 94 S.Ct. 1820, 40 L.Ed.2d 341 (1974).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset, a duly-authorized law enforcement officer must obtain approval from the Attorney General of the United States or a specially designated assistant attorney general in order to apply to a federal judge for a wiretap. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2516(1). Once such approval is obtained, the officer must present a written application for a wiretap to the judge. Before issuing the wiretap, the judge must make certain enumerated findings and issue an <i>ex parte</i> order containing specified elements. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2518(1), (3)-(4).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the application for the wiretap, the government must make a detailed proffer including: (a) the identity of the investigative or law enforcement officer making the application, and the officer authorizing the application; (b) a full and complete statement of the facts and circumstances justifying the applicant's belief that an order should be issued;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> (c) a full and complete statement as to whether or not other investigative procedures have been tried and failed or why they appear to be too dangerous or unlikely to succeed if tried; (d) a statement of the period of time for which the interception is required to be maintained; and (e) a full and complete statement of the facts concerning all previous applications involving any of the same persons, facilities, or places specified in the application. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2518(1)(a)-(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, in the event the application is granted, Title III provides numerous grounds upon which communications obtained pursuant to a Title III warrant may be suppressed in any proceeding. Specifically, the statute states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any aggrieved person in any trial, hearing, or proceeding in or before any court, department, officer, agency, regulatory body, or other authority of the United States, a State, or a political subdivision thereof, may move to suppress the contents of any wire or oral communication intercepted pursuant to this chapter, or evidence derived therefrom, on the grounds that &#8212; (i) the communication was unlawfully intercepted; (ii) the order or authorization or approval under which it was intercepted is insufficient on its face; or (iii) the interception was not made in conformity with the order of authorization or approval....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> &#167; 2518(10)(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">L&#243;pez makes sundry arguments as to why the incriminating communications intercepted by the government must be suppressed. He argues first that the government's application was inadequate on its face to satisfy the so-called \"necessity requirement\" of Title III. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 2518(1)(c). L&#243;pez also argues that the government neglected to disclose its intention to use civilian monitors and, therefore, that its subsequent use of such monitors violates Title III and compels the suppression of the intercepted calls. Lastly, L&#243;pez raises challenges to the monitor's minimization efforts and the supervision of the monitors by government agents. We address each of L&#243;pez's arguments in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. The \"necessity requirement\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Title III requires that a wiretap application include \"a full and complete statement as to whether or not other investigative procedures have been tried and failed or why they reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too dangerous.\" <i>Hoffman,</i> 832 F.2d at 1306 (quoting 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2518(1)(c)); <i>see also United States v. Kahn,</i> 415 U.S. 143, 153 n. 12, 94 S.Ct. 977, 39 L.Ed.2d 225 (1974) (noting that the necessity requirement was \"designed to assure that wiretapping is not resorted to in situations where traditional investigative techniques would suffice to expose the crime\"). In order to satisfy this requirement of necessity, the government must demonstrate that it has made \"a reasonable, good faith effort to run the gamut of normal investigative procedures before resorting to means so intrusive as electronic interception of telephone calls.\" <i>Hoffman,</i> 832 F.2d at 1306-07. However, the necessity requirement is not tantamount to an exhaustion requirement. <i>See United States v. Edwards,</i> 69 F.3d 419, 429 (10th Cir.1995) (\"[L]aw enforcement officials are not required to exhaust all other conceivable investigative procedures before resorting to wiretapping.\") (citations and quotations omitted); <i>see also United States v. David,</i> 940 F.2d 722, 728-29 (1st Cir.1991) (holding that necessity was shown even though government had not attempted to use search warrants, pen registers, or undercover agents). Consequently, Title III does not \"force the government to run outlandish risks ... before seeking a wiretap.\" <i>Hoffman,</i> 832 F.2d at 1306.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reviewing the sufficiency of the government's showing of necessity, the \"`appeals court role is not to make a <i>de novo</i> determination of sufficiency as if it were [the issuing judge], but to decide if the facts set forth in the application were minimally adequate to support the determination that was made.'\" <i>United States v. Ashley,</i> 876 F.2d 1069, 1074 (1st Cir. 1989) (quoting <i>United States v. Scibelli,</i> 549 F.2d 222, 226 (1st Cir.1977)). That is, \"[t]he sufficiency of the affidavit is to be upheld where the appellate court determines that the issuing court could have reasonably concluded that normal investigatory procedures reasonably appeared to be unlikely to succeed.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">L&#243;pez argues that the government's application was insufficient on its face. He characterizes the government's affidavit in support of the application as largely composed of conclusory assertions devoid of factual specificity. He also contends that the application reveals that the government failed to utilize some investigative avenues that still remained open.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the government's affidavit must show with specificity why ordinary means of investigation will fail; conclusory statements without factual support are not sufficient. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2518(1)(c) (requiring a \"full and complete statement\"); <i>see also United States v. Castillo-Garc&#237;a,</i> 117 F.3d 1179, 1194 (10th Cir.1997) (\"[G]eneralities, or statements in the conclusory language of the statute, are insufficient to support a wiretap application.\"). But in this case, we are satisfied that the government's application was more than minimally adequate to persuade the issuing judge that the warrant was reasonably necessary. It would be <i>de trop</i> for us to reiterate the analysis of Judge Carter in the court below, which we find to be both thorough and well reasoned, so we shall confine ourselves to some key observations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The affidavit of DEA Agent Boyle described several alternative investigative techniques that had been tried and failed, appeared unlikely to succeed, might alert the conspirators, or were too dangerous to pursue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Although several of the techniques (such as physical surveillance, interrogation of informants, pen-register analysis, and controlled buys by undercover agents) had proven valuable in the past, the utility of those tools was exhausted or greatly diminished by the time the government sought its warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the details of Agent Boyle's affidavit demonstrate, the traditional techniques employed by the DEA over the course of several months had failed to establish the identity of some conspirators, particularly those at the top of the distribution chain. <i>See United States v. D&#237;az,</i> 176 F.3d 52, 110-11 (2d Cir.1999) (holding that necessity for wiretap was shown because traditional techniques were not adequate to reveal sources of drug supply and location of drug proceeds); <i>United States v. Cooper,</i> 868 F.2d 1505, 1509-10 (6th Cir.1989) (holding that necessity for wiretap was shown because wiretap followed lengthy investigation in which normal investigative procedures were used extensively but had not identified customers and agents of prescription drug ring). Moreover, the affidavit documents specific incidents suggesting that the further use of surveillance and undercover operations risked revealing the investigation and placing law enforcement officers in harm's way. For example, one conspirator expressed concern to an undercover agent about the \"heat\" in the area. Months later, the same conspirator refused to speak to or deal with the agent. One of the government's cooperating witnesses was also questioned by conspiracy members as to whether he was in league with the authorities. And the affidavit points to other instances where the conspirators engaged in counter-surveillance designed to avoid detection by law enforcement. <i>See United States v. Williams,</i> 124 F.3d 411, 418 (3d Cir.1997) (necessity shown because government had been unable to use a confidential informant without high risk of discovery, and co-conspirators used evasive techniques such as electronic detection equipment); <i>United States v. Carrazana,</i> 921 F.2d 1557, 1564-65 (11th Cir.1991) (necessity for wiretap shown because other investigative methods were unsuccessful due to drug ring's counter-surveillance protection).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other investigative techniques that were not tried by the government were also inadequate because they might have revealed the ongoing investigation. The execution of a search warrant or issuance of grand jury subpoenas would have likely alerted other conspiracy members to law enforcement's investigation. Also, although L&#243;pez suggests that a handful of cooperating sources (including two active conspiracy members who had been arrested during the course of the investigation) could have provided useful grand jury testimony, we think the issuing judge would have been justified in doubting the efficacy of such action. As Agent Boyle states in his affidavit, two of the cooperating sources had limited information concerning the full scope of the conspiracy, and calling other cooperating sources before the grand jury could arouse the suspicions of others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed as a whole, the information contained in the government's application for the Title III warrant was not, as L&#243;pez suggests, mere boilerplate. Nor were the circumstances surrounding the government's investigation of the drug conspiracy so commonplace or generic that our approval of the issuance of the warrant in this case would assure that a warrant could be issued in virtually any drug investigation. The government provided the issuing judge with specific factors &#8212; particularly the DEA's inability to identify key conspiracy members and the conspiracy's growing awareness of law enforcement activity &#8212; that militated in favor of using a more drastic investigative tool. We therefore affirm the district court's ruling that the government's warrant application satisfied Title III's necessity requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Civilian monitors</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">L&#243;pez argues next that the communications must be suppressed because the government violated Title III by failing to disclose to the issuing judge that civilian monitors would be utilized during the interception process. Although we agree with L&#243;pez that the government must disclose its intention to use civilian monitors, we do not find the failure to do so in this case to be sufficient grounds to suppress the communications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no doubt that the use of civilian monitors for the execution of a wiretap cannot constitute a <i>per se</i> violation of Title III, since the statute explicitly contemplates the assistance of civilian personnel. Specifically, Title III provides, in relevant part: \"An interception under this chapter may be conducted in whole or in part by Government personnel, or by an individual operating under a contract with the Government, acting under the supervision of an investigative or law enforcement officer authorized to conduct the interception.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2518(5). Nevertheless, Title III generally places a burden of \"full and complete\" disclosure on the government in its application for a wiretap, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 2518(1)(b),(c) &amp; (d), and the issuing judge is obliged to craft the order approving the wiretap with specificity, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 2518(4). These provisions necessitate candor on the part of the government &#8212; a candor that, in our view, would generally be undermined if the government could withhold important information about the manner in which the wiretap will be conducted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's failure to disclose its plans to use civilian monitors frustrates the objectives of other provisions of Title III as well. For example, the statute mandates that the issuing judge include in any order a provision requiring that the wiretap be conducted in such a way as to minimize nonpertinent communications. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 2518(5). If the issuing judge is kept ignorant of the manner in which the government intends to execute the wiretap, this diminishes the judge's ability to craft an order that is sufficiently protective of the minimization requirement. In addition, the statute permits the issuing judge to require status reports showing \"what progress has been made toward achievement of the authorized objective and the need for continued interception.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2518(6). Yet, without information on how the calls are being intercepted, and by what personnel, the judge's impression of the progress of the wiretap may be mistaken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of these considerations, we hold that the government must disclose, as a part of its application for a wiretap warrant, any intention to utilize the services of civilian monitors in the execution of the warrant. To hold otherwise would, in our view, run counter to the general duty of candor the statute imposes on the government and impair the issuing judge's ability to preserve important privacy interests protected by Title III.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having established that Title III requires the government to provide the issuing judge with information on any plans to employ civilian monitors, we turn to the question of whether the government's conduct in this particular case requires the suppression of the communications that incriminate L&#243;pez. Title III sets out a broadly-worded statutory exclusion rule that, on its face, prohibits the use at trial of any evidence \"derived from\" a wiretap \"if the disclosure of that information would be in violation of this chapter.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2515. The government's failure to disclose its intention to use civilian monitors, which violates an obligation under Title III, thus lays the foundation for a motion to suppress.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the broad language of &#167; 2515, \"it is well-settled that not every failure to comply fully with any requirement provided in Title III necessitates suppression.\" <i>United States v. Escobar-de Jes&#250;s,</i> 187 F.3d 148, 171 (1st Cir.1999); <i>see United States v. Donovan,</i> 429 U.S. 413, 432-34, 97 S.Ct. 658, 50 L.Ed.2d 652 (1977); <i>United States v. Chavez,</i> 416 U.S. 562, 571-79, 94 S.Ct. 1849, 40 L.Ed.2d 380 (1974). A court evaluating a suppression motion must consider whether the underlying violation of Title III frustrated the protective purpose of that statute in a particular case. Thus, \"violations of even ... central requirements do not mandate suppression if the government demonstrates to the court's satisfaction that the statutory purpose has been achieved despite the violation.\" <i>United States v. Cunningham,</i> 113 F.3d 289, 293-94 (1st Cir. 1997) (quoting <i>United States v. Johnson,</i> 696 F.2d 115, 121 (D.C.Cir.1982)). Without trivializing the nature of the violation in this case, we find that the wiretap was conducted in manner that preserved the core protective purposes of Title III.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The restrictions in Title III aim to limit the use of wiretapping to those situations where it is truly justified, and to protect privacy as mush as reasonably possible when wiretapping is used. See <i>Escobar-de Jes&#250;s,</i> 187 F.3d at 171. The undisclosed use of civilian monitors did not affect the likelihood that the wiretap would be authorized in the first place, nor did it increase the wiretap's intrusion on privacy interests. The principal purposes of Title III were not frustrated by the violations here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the district court's unchallenged findings demonstrate that, aside from the failure to disclose the use of civilian monitors, the wiretap was conducted in an admirably professional manner. Privacy concerns were protected to the greatest extent possible. Suppression is less likely to be necessary when the violation of Title III represents an isolated flaw in \"a process that in all other important respects complied with the statute.\" <i>Cunningham,</i> 113 F.3d at 294.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, there is no indication that the government's violations of Title III were willful or knowing. We are the first court of appeals to hold that Title III requires the government to disclose any plans to employ civilian monitors; indeed, we appear to be the first court that has been squarely presented with the issue. Thus, the law enforcement in this case presumably did not realize that their undisclosed use of civilian monitors could constitute a violation of the statute. The district court determined that, although the used of civilian monitors departed from the precise terms of the order authorizing the wiretap, \"the violation was inadvertent, as opposed to a conscious decision by the Government or law enforcement officers to take action they knew to be contrary to an intercept order.\" <i>L&#243;pez,</i> 106 F.Supp.2d at 100.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, Title III imposes an obligation on the government to disclose to the issuing judge any plans to use civilian monitors in the execution of a wiretap warrant. In the case at hand, however, the government's failure to make that disclosure, along with the government's seeming violation of an order that did not permit the use of civilian monitors, does not provide a valid basis for suppressing the intercepted communications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Miscellaneous issues</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">L&#243;pez offers two remaining arguments as to why the intercepted communications should be suppressed. We think both arguments lack merit and address them only briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, L&#243;pez contends that the government violated the requirement that civilian monitors conducting an interception must be \"supervis[ed]\" by an \"investigative or law enforcement officer authorized to conduct the interception.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2518(5). Even assuming that a violation of this requirement could conceivably provide the basis for a motion to suppress, L&#243;pez's argument in this case is sunk by the findings of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the opinion below, the civilian monitors, who worked sixteen-hour shifts every day for twenty days, were supervised at all times by a shift supervisor. The one apparent exception was a single instance where the supervising agent left the plant for ten to fifteen minutes to conduct routine surveillance. L&#243;pez does not appear to challenge Judge Carter's findings as clearly erroneous. <i>See United States v. Hawkins,</i> 279 F.3d 83, 85 (1st Cir.2002) (\"[W]e review the factual findings of the district court for clear error.\"). Instead he argues that, as a matter of law, the single lapse of supervision taints all of the intercepted communications. We disagree, and think that such a <i>de minimis</i> departure from the supervision standard is no basis for excluding the communications. This is especially so where, as here, L&#243;pez makes no attempt to identify any prejudice arising from the interception of communications that might have occurred during the brief unsupervised period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, L&#243;pez argues that the civilian monitors were ineffective at minimizing non-pertinent calls, as is required by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2518(5). The minimization requirement \"spotlights the interest in confining intrusions as narrowly as possible so as not to trench impermissibly upon the personal lives and privacy of wiretap targets and those who, often innocently, come into contact with such suspects.\" <i>Hoffman,</i> 832 F.2d at 1307. When fulfilling its obligation to minimize unauthorized communications, \"`[t]he government is held to a standard of honest effort; perfection is usually not attainable, and is certainly not legally required.'\" <i>United States v. Charles,</i> 213 F.3d 10, 22 (1st Cir.) (quoting <i>United States v. Uribe,</i> 890 F.2d 554, 557 (1st Cir.1989)), <i>cert. denied,</i> 531 U.S. 915, 121 S.Ct. 272, 148 L.Ed.2d 198 (2000). In examining the government's adherence to this standard, we look at several factors, including: 1) the nature and complexity of the suspected crimes; 2) the thoroughness of the government's precautions to bring about minimization; and 3) the degree of judicial supervision over the surveillance process. <i>See United States v. London,</i> 66 F.3d 1227, 1236 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judged by these criteria, the government's minimization efforts in this case far exceeded what was required; indeed, its performance bordered on perfection. The wiretap intercepted approximately 1700 calls. Of that large number, L&#243;pez and his co-defendants could identify only six calls that arguably were unrelated to the drug conspiracy. This amounts to only 0.35% of the total number of calls intercepted. Furthermore, the district court analyzed the six challenged calls and found as a fact, unchallenged in this appeal, that only two of them were improperly minimized. Thus, the sum total of impermissibly intercepted calls was a mere 0.11% of the total calls. <i>L&#243;pez,</i> 2000 WL 761977, at *9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although \"blind reliance on the percentage of nonpertinent calls intercepted is not a sure guide\" to determining whether the minimization was proper, <i>Scott v. United States,</i> 436 U.S. 128, 140, 98 S.Ct. 1717, 56 L.Ed.2d 168 (1978), the nearly flawless performance of the government in this case carries significant weight. <i>Cf. United States v. Bennett,</i> 219 F.3d 1117, 1124 (9th Cir.) (minimization requirement met where improperly intercepted calls accounted for only 3.65% of 7322 total intercepted calls), <i>cert. denied,</i> 531 U.S. 1056, 121 S.Ct. 666, 148 L.Ed.2d 568 (2000). Plus, the findings of the district court support the conclusion that the government established and observed thorough precautions to bring about minimization and that there was a significant degree of judicial supervision over the surveillance process. <i>See London,</i> 66 F.3d at 1236. Finally, as the district court found, L&#243;pez was not prejudiced in any way by the improper minimization of the two calls. The district court's decision not to suppress the communications was therefore justified in all respects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. SENTENCING</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Forging ahead <i>pro se,</i> L&#243;pez challenges the 240-month sentence imposed by the district court as violative of the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Because we conclude that L&#243;pez voluntarily relinquished his <i>Apprendi</i> arguments below, we affirm the sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The indictment under which L&#243;pez was charged alleged that he was subject to the penalty provisions of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A) (providing for a maximum sentence of life). However, the indictment, which was issued pre-<i>Apprendi,</i> did not specify a drug quantity. After <i>Apprendi</i> was decided, the government agreed not to seek a new indictment that alleged a drug amount and to limit L&#243;pez's sentence exposure to 20 years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The flawed indictment became a well-worn topic in the district court during the sentencing proceedings. On October 3, 2000, after hearings and rulings on suppression motions, L&#243;pez appeared, with counsel, to enter a plea of guilty. When asked whether he was pleading guilty because he was guilty and for no other reason, L&#243;pez responded, \"I have another reason ... [t]he <i>Apprendi</i> case.\" At this point, defense counsel interjected, \"What I have told [L&#243;pez] ... is that it is my belief that ... <i>Apprendi</i> can only allow for a sentence up to 20 years....\" Judge Carter conceded the irregularity but noted that the government stood ready to recharge L&#243;pez under an indictment that specified a drug quantity. Judge Carter also pointed out that a superceding indictment could increase the maximum sentence exposure beyond 240 months. Defense counsel then admitted that he had advised L&#243;pez \"from a strategic standpoint\" that it was in his best interest to plead guilty before the government could take such action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After this discussion, the court again asked L&#243;pez if he was pleading guilty because he was guilty. L&#243;pez replied that he was. The court then asked, \"Is the only other reason you have to tender this plea, your desire to limit exposure to the length of the period of incarceration?\" L&#243;pez replied, \"yes.\" After explaining to L&#243;pez the rights that he surrendered by pleading guilty, Judge Carter ascertained that L&#243;pez understood and waived these rights. L&#243;pez was then sentenced to 240 months in prison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the first time on appeal, L&#243;pez now argues that his sentence violated <i>Apprendi</i> because the government was derelict in its duty to charge a drug quantity in the indictment. Finding that this case presents one of the clearest examples of waiver imaginable, we reject L&#243;pez's entreaty.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A party's mere <i>forfeiture,</i> or failure to timely assert a right, does not preclude appellate review for \"plain error\" under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b), but a <i>waiver</i> of a right bars even this highly deferential form of scrutiny. <i>See United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 733, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <i>see also United States v. Lemmerer,</i> 277 F.3d 579, 591 n. 4 (1st Cir.2002). In order for us to find waiver, the party must have made an \"`intentional relinquishment or abandonment'\" of a known right. <i>United States v. Mitchell,</i> 85 F.3d 800, 807 (1st Cir.1996) (quoting <i>Olano,</i> 507 U.S. at 733, 113 S.Ct. 1770).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, there is no doubt that L&#243;pez was well aware that <i>Apprendi</i> carried implications for his case. As L&#243;pez stated during the plea colloquy, his attorney had advised him to plead guilty under the present indictment precisely because of the effect of <i>Apprendi.</i> Judge Carter also apprised L&#243;pez of the potential <i>Apprendi</i> issue. Indeed, Judge Carter guaranteed that the sentence imposed would be consistent with <i>Apprendi,</i> and stated that he would allow L&#243;pez to withdraw his guilty plea and proceed to trial if a sentence in excess of 20 years were handed down.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> When the 20-year sentence was announced, L&#243;pez did not object or seek to withdraw his plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, L&#243;pez gained a valuable benefit by acquiescing to the charges in the original indictment. As noted above, the government was prepared to seek a superseding indictment with a specific drug quantity. Had the government done so, L&#243;pez would have doubtlessly faced a harsher sentence. For this reason, L&#243;pez's counsel recognized that, \"from a strategic standpoint,\" L&#243;pez was better off pleading guilty to the original indictment. L&#243;pez also admitted that his plea was based in part on his desire to limit his exposure for purposes of sentencing. L&#243;pez cannot now appeal what he earlier used as a pawn to better his situation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because L&#243;pez knowingly and voluntarily relinquished any appeal stemming from the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Apprendi</i> (and thereby gained a valuable benefit), we cannot review his claims of error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court handled this case in praiseworthy fashion.

United States,</i> 526 U.S. 227, 243 n. 6, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999)).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> L&#243;pez also appears to argue that absence of a drug quantity element in the indictment deprived the district court of jurisdiction and requires the vacatur of his sentence. This argument is foreclosed by the Supreme Court's recent decision in<i>United States v. Cotton,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002). Addressing a defendant's conviction under of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 846 and 841(a)(1), the Court in <i>Cotton</i> unanimously held that the failure of the government to include a drug quantity in the indictment was not a jurisdictional defect that deprived a federal court of the power to impose a sentence. <i>See</i> ___ U.S. at ___, 122 S.Ct. at 1785. Instead, the Court found that a sentence based on an indictment lacking a specific drug quantity would be reviewed for \"plain error.\" <i>Id.</i> Since we find no valid claim of error to review, L&#243;pez's jurisdictional argument is a non-starter.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The sentence imposed by the district court insured that, even if L&#243;pez's belated<i>Apprendi</i> arguments could be reviewed for \"plain error,\" <i>see</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b), there is simply no \"error\" to correct. The \"default\" or \"catchall\" provision of the statute under which L&#243;pez was charged, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(C), prescribes that a 240-month maximum sentence may be imposed for trafficking even the smallest quantity of cocaine. <i>United States v.

Thus, Judge Carter's sentence, set at the upper limit of what is permitted by 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(C), did not violate <i>Apprendi,</i> which \"applies only when the disputed `fact' enlarges the applicable statutory maximum and the defendant's sentence exceeds the original maximum.\" <i>United States v.

On appeal, L&#243;pez challenges an adverse ruling below on his motion to suppress evidence obtained pursuant to a wiretap warrant governed by Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (\"Title III\"), 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2510-22. For the first time on appeal, the appellant also raises a constitutional challenge to the sentence imposed by the district court. For the reasons set forth below, we reject L&#243;pez's arguments and affirm the rulings of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The conspiracy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early April 1999, an agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") received information from a confidential source indicating that a cocaine distribution conspiracy was operating in the area of Brunswick, Maine. With the help of the confidential source, undercover DEA agents were able to contact members of the conspiracy directly and arrange several controlled purchases of cocaine. The DEA was also able to gain information concerning the conspiracy through other investigative techniques, including visual surveillance and pen-register analysis. In addition, DEA agents obtained the assistance of at least one other confidential source who was able to identify other members of the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 17, 1999, the government applied for authorization to conduct wiretaps of two mobile telephones allegedly used by members of the drug distribution ring. Along with the application, DEA Agent Brian Boyle (\"Boyle\") submitted an affidavit describing the investigation of the drug conspiracy to date. Boyle detailed the progress of the investigation and various investigative techniques that either had been tried previously or were deemed unlikely to succeed. Based on the government's application, Chief U.S. District Judge D. Brock Hornby granted the wiretap application. The order issued by Chief Judge Hornby provided:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wherefore, it is hereby Ordered that special agents of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration and other investigative and law enforcement officers, assisted, if necessary, by qualified translators, pursuant to the application of the Assistant United States Attorney Jonathan A. Toof, are authorized to intercept and record wire communications to and from the cellular telephone ... assigned and billed to Orlando Santana, Jr.....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The wiretap plant was operated for approximately twenty days. As a result of certain subscriber changes, the order was amended once during the course of the plant's operation. And on November 29 and December 7, 1999, the government filed progress reports with the court setting forth the number of calls intercepted, samples of the types of conversations recorded, and names of conspirators who had and had not been identified. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2518(6) (providing that the authorizing judge may require the government to submit periodic progress reports).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately, the wiretap intercepted approximately 1700 telephone calls. Throughout the duration of the wiretap, the government relied on the services of civilian monitors working under contract with the government. The civilian monitors provided some translation services; however, the majority of the civilians' services consisted of monitoring all intercepted calls and performing \"minimization\" &#8212; that is, the implementation of procedures established by the government to ensure that the fewest number of non-pertinent (or \"innocent\") calls are intercepted. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2518(5) (providing for a minimization requirement in any order approving or extending a wiretap warrant).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the information obtained through the wiretap, the government was able to build a formidable case against the conspiracy members. According to the appellant, a number of the intercepted telephone calls were particularly incriminating to him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Proceedings below</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">L&#243;pez was indicted and charged together with seventeen other co-conspirators. Count I of the indictment charged L&#243;pez and the other defendants with a conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A), and 846. The remaining counts of the seven-count indictment pertained to conspirators other than L&#243;pez.

L&#243;pez argued below: 1) that there was no probable cause to issue the wiretap authorization; 2) that the government failed to demonstrate in its application for wiretap authorization that conventional investigative techniques were ineffective; and 3) that the government failed to properly minimize the interception of the telephone calls. Judge Carter denied L&#243;pez's initial motion to suppress, but raised concerns in his written decision about the government's use of civilian monitors to conduct the minimization. <i>See United States v. L&#243;pez,</i> No.Crim. 99-79-P-V, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">761977</span></span> (D.Me. April 28, 2000). Judge Carter then invited all of the defendants to file additional motions to suppress for the purpose of addressing this issue. L&#243;pez did so and argued that the government's use of civilian monitors exceeded the scope of the original wiretap authorization and, as a consequence, resulted in improper minimization of calls to the targeted phones. After this additional round of briefing, Judge Carter denied the motion to suppress. <i>See United States v.

TITLE III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By enacting Title III, Congress sought to protect the privacy of wire and oral communications while, at the same time, authorizing the use of electronic surveillance evidence obtained by law enforcement under specified conditions. <i>See Bartnicki v.

Once such approval is obtained, the officer must present a written application for a wiretap to the judge.

L&#243;pez also argues that the government neglected to disclose its intention to use civilian monitors and, therefore, that its subsequent use of such monitors violates Title III and compels the suppression of the intercepted calls.

But in this case, we are satisfied that the government's application was more than minimally adequate to persuade the issuing judge that the warrant was reasonably necessary. It would be <i>de trop</i> for us to reiterate the analysis of Judge Carter in the court below, which we find to be both thorough and well reasoned, so we shall confine ourselves to some key observations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The affidavit of DEA Agent Boyle described several alternative investigative techniques that had been tried and failed, appeared unlikely to succeed, might alert the conspirators, or were too dangerous to pursue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Although several of the techniques (such as physical surveillance, interrogation of informants, pen-register analysis, and controlled buys by undercover agents) had proven valuable in the past, the utility of those tools was exhausted or greatly diminished by the time the government sought its warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the details of Agent Boyle's affidavit demonstrate, the traditional techniques employed by the DEA over the course of several months had failed to establish the identity of some conspirators, particularly those at the top of the distribution chain. <i>See United States v. D&#237;az,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763759\"><a href=\"/opinion/763759/united-states-v-jose-diaz-also-known-as-jolly-jesse-rodriguez-also-known/\"><span class=\"volume\">176</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span>, 110-11 (2d Cir.1999) (holding that necessity for wiretap was shown because traditional techniques were not adequate to reveal sources of drug supply and location of drug proceeds); <i>United States v. Cooper,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"519185\"><a href=\"/opinion/519185/united-states-v-otis-cooper-sylvester-graham-and-dennis-r-hoyer/\"><span class=\"volume\">868</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1505</span></a></span>, 1509-10 (6th Cir.1989) (holding that necessity for wiretap was shown because wiretap followed lengthy investigation in which normal investigative procedures were used extensively but had not identified customers and agents of prescription drug ring). Moreover, the affidavit documents specific incidents suggesting that the further use of surveillance and undercover operations risked revealing the investigation and placing law enforcement officers in harm's way. For example, one conspirator expressed concern to an undercover agent about the \"heat\" in the area. Months later, the same conspirator refused to speak to or deal with the agent. One of the government's cooperating witnesses was also questioned by conspiracy members as to whether he was in league with the authorities. And the affidavit points to other instances where the conspirators engaged in counter-surveillance designed to avoid detection by law enforcement. <i>See United States v. Williams,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"746223\"><a href=\"/opinion/746223/united-states-v-salvatore-a-williams-aka-sonny-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">411</span></a></span>, 418 (3d Cir.1997) (necessity shown because government had been unable to use a confidential informant without high risk of discovery, and co-conspirators used evasive techniques such as electronic detection equipment); <i>United States v. Carrazana,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"553325\"><a href=\"/opinion/553325/united-states-v-david-carrazana-pablo-carballo-anselmo-cosio-carlos/\"><span class=\"volume\">921</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1557</span></a></span>, 1564-65 (11th Cir.1991) (necessity for wiretap shown because other investigative methods were unsuccessful due to drug ring's counter-surveillance protection).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other investigative techniques that were not tried by the government were also inadequate because they might have revealed the ongoing investigation. The execution of a search warrant or issuance of grand jury subpoenas would have likely alerted other conspiracy members to law enforcement's investigation. Also, although L&#243;pez suggests that a handful of cooperating sources (including two active conspiracy members who had been arrested during the course of the investigation) could have provided useful grand jury testimony, we think the issuing judge would have been justified in doubting the efficacy of such action. As Agent Boyle states in his affidavit, two of the cooperating sources had limited information concerning the full scope of the conspiracy, and calling other cooperating sources before the grand jury could arouse the suspicions of others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed as a whole, the information contained in the government's application for the Title III warrant was not, as L&#243;pez suggests, mere boilerplate. Nor were the circumstances surrounding the government's investigation of the drug conspiracy so commonplace or generic that our approval of the issuance of the warrant in this case would assure that a warrant could be issued in virtually any drug investigation. The government provided the issuing judge with specific factors &#8212; particularly the DEA's inability to identify key conspiracy members and the conspiracy's growing awareness of law enforcement activity &#8212; that militated in favor of using a more drastic investigative tool. We therefore affirm the district court's ruling that the government's warrant application satisfied Title III's necessity requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Civilian monitors</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">L&#243;pez argues next that the communications must be suppressed because the government violated Title III by failing to disclose to the issuing judge that civilian monitors would be utilized during the interception process. Although we agree with L&#243;pez that the government must disclose its intention to use civilian monitors, we do not find the failure to do so in this case to be sufficient grounds to suppress the communications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no doubt that the use of civilian monitors for the execution of a wiretap cannot constitute a <i>per se</i> violation of Title III, since the statute explicitly contemplates the assistance of civilian personnel. Specifically, Title III provides, in relevant part: \"An interception under this chapter may be conducted in whole or in part by Government personnel, or by an individual operating under a contract with the Government, acting under the supervision of an investigative or law enforcement officer authorized to conduct the interception.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2518(5). Nevertheless, Title III generally places a burden of \"full and complete\" disclosure on the government in its application for a wiretap, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 2518(1)(b),(c) &amp; (d), and the issuing judge is obliged to craft the order approving the wiretap with specificity, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 2518(4). These provisions necessitate candor on the part of the government &#8212; a candor that, in our view, would generally be undermined if the government could withhold important information about the manner in which the wiretap will be conducted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's failure to disclose its plans to use civilian monitors frustrates the objectives of other provisions of Title III as well. For example, the statute mandates that the issuing judge include in any order a provision requiring that the wiretap be conducted in such a way as to minimize nonpertinent communications. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 2518(5). If the issuing judge is kept ignorant of the manner in which the government intends to execute the wiretap, this diminishes the judge's ability to craft an order that is sufficiently protective of the minimization requirement. In addition, the statute permits the issuing judge to require status reports showing \"what progress has been made toward achievement of the authorized objective and the need for continued interception.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2518(6). Yet, without information on how the calls are being intercepted, and by what personnel, the judge's impression of the progress of the wiretap may be mistaken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of these considerations, we hold that the government must disclose, as a part of its application for a wiretap warrant, any intention to utilize the services of civilian monitors in the execution of the warrant. To hold otherwise would, in our view, run counter to the general duty of candor the statute imposes on the government and impair the issuing judge's ability to preserve important privacy interests protected by Title III.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having established that Title III requires the government to provide the issuing judge with information on any plans to employ civilian monitors, we turn to the question of whether the government's conduct in this particular case requires the suppression of the communications that incriminate L&#243;pez. Title III sets out a broadly-worded statutory exclusion rule that, on its face, prohibits the use at trial of any evidence \"derived from\" a wiretap \"if the disclosure of that information would be in violation of this chapter.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2515. The government's failure to disclose its intention to use civilian monitors, which violates an obligation under Title III, thus lays the foundation for a motion to suppress.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the broad language of &#167; 2515, \"it is well-settled that not every failure to comply fully with any requirement provided in Title III necessitates suppression.\" <i>United States v.

Without trivializing the nature of the violation in this case, we find that the wiretap was conducted in manner that preserved the core protective purposes of Title III.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The restrictions in Title III aim to limit the use of wiretapping to those situations where it is truly justified, and to protect privacy as mush as reasonably possible when wiretapping is used. See <i>Escobar-de Jes&#250;s,</i> 187 F.3d at 171. The undisclosed use of civilian monitors did not affect the likelihood that the wiretap would be authorized in the first place, nor did it increase the wiretap's intrusion on privacy interests. The principal purposes of Title III were not frustrated by the violations here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the district court's unchallenged findings demonstrate that, aside from the failure to disclose the use of civilian monitors, the wiretap was conducted in an admirably professional manner. Privacy concerns were protected to the greatest extent possible. Suppression is less likely to be necessary when the violation of Title III represents an isolated flaw in \"a process that in all other important respects complied with the statute.\" <i>Cunningham,</i> 113 F.3d at 294.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, there is no indication that the government's violations of Title III were willful or knowing. We are the first court of appeals to hold that Title III requires the government to disclose any plans to employ civilian monitors; indeed, we appear to be the first court that has been squarely presented with the issue. Thus, the law enforcement in this case presumably did not realize that their undisclosed use of civilian monitors could constitute a violation of the statute. The district court determined that, although the used of civilian monitors departed from the precise terms of the order authorizing the wiretap, \"the violation was inadvertent, as opposed to a conscious decision by the Government or law enforcement officers to take action they knew to be contrary to an intercept order.\" <i>L&#243;pez,</i> 106 F.Supp.2d at 100.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, Title III imposes an obligation on the government to disclose to the issuing judge any plans to use civilian monitors in the execution of a wiretap warrant. In the case at hand, however, the government's failure to make that disclosure, along with the government's seeming violation of an order that did not permit the use of civilian monitors, does not provide a valid basis for suppressing the intercepted communications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Miscellaneous issues</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">L&#243;pez offers two remaining arguments as to why the intercepted communications should be suppressed. We think both arguments lack merit and address them only briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, L&#243;pez contends that the government violated the requirement that civilian monitors conducting an interception must be \"supervis[ed]\" by an \"investigative or law enforcement officer authorized to conduct the interception.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2518(5). Even assuming that a violation of this requirement could conceivably provide the basis for a motion to suppress, L&#243;pez's argument in this case is sunk by the findings of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the opinion below, the civilian monitors, who worked sixteen-hour shifts every day for twenty days, were supervised at all times by a shift supervisor. The one apparent exception was a single instance where the supervising agent left the plant for ten to fifteen minutes to conduct routine surveillance. L&#243;pez does not appear to challenge Judge Carter's findings as clearly erroneous. <i>See United States v. Hawkins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199815\"><a href=\"/opinion/199815/united-states-v-hawkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">279</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, 85 (1st Cir.2002) (\"[W]e review the factual findings of the district court for clear error.\"). Instead he argues that, as a matter of law, the single lapse of supervision taints all of the intercepted communications. We disagree, and think that such a <i>de minimis</i> departure from the supervision standard is no basis for excluding the communications. This is especially so where, as here, L&#243;pez makes no attempt to identify any prejudice arising from the interception of communications that might have occurred during the brief unsupervised period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, L&#243;pez argues that the civilian monitors were ineffective at minimizing non-pertinent calls, as is required by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2518(5). The minimization requirement \"spotlights the interest in confining intrusions as narrowly as possible so as not to trench impermissibly upon the personal lives and privacy of wiretap targets and those who, often innocently, come into contact with such suspects.\" <i>Hoffman,</i> 832 F.2d at 1307. When fulfilling its obligation to minimize unauthorized communications, \"`[t]he government is held to a standard of honest effort; perfection is usually not attainable, and is certainly not legally required.'\" <i>United States v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">198</span></span> (2000). In examining the government's adherence to this standard, we look at several factors, including: 1) the nature and complexity of the suspected crimes; 2) the thoroughness of the government's precautions to bring about minimization; and 3) the degree of judicial supervision over the surveillance process. <i>See United States v. London,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196355\"><a href=\"/opinion/196355/united-states-v-london/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1227</span></a></span>, 1236 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judged by these criteria, the government's minimization efforts in this case far exceeded what was required; indeed, its performance bordered on perfection. The wiretap intercepted approximately 1700 calls. Of that large number, L&#243;pez and his co-defendants could identify only six calls that arguably were unrelated to the drug conspiracy. This amounts to only 0.35% of the total number of calls intercepted. Furthermore, the district court analyzed the six challenged calls and found as a fact, unchallenged in this appeal, that only two of them were improperly minimized. Thus, the sum total of impermissibly intercepted calls was a mere 0.11% of the total calls. <i>L&#243;pez,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">761977</span></span>, at *9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although \"blind reliance on the percentage of nonpertinent calls intercepted is not a sure guide\" to determining whether the minimization was proper, <i>Scott v.

Plus, the findings of the district court support the conclusion that the government established and observed thorough precautions to bring about minimization and that there was a significant degree of judicial supervision over the surveillance process. <i>See London,</i> 66 F.3d at 1236. Finally, as the district court found, L&#243;pez was not prejudiced in any way by the improper minimization of the two calls. The district court's decision not to suppress the communications was therefore justified in all respects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.

However, the indictment, which was issued pre-<i>Apprendi,</i> did not specify a drug quantity. After <i>Apprendi</i> was decided, the government agreed not to seek a new indictment that alleged a drug amount and to limit L&#243;pez's sentence exposure to 20 years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The flawed indictment became a well-worn topic in the district court during the sentencing proceedings. On October 3, 2000, after hearings and rulings on suppression motions, L&#243;pez appeared, with counsel, to enter a plea of guilty. When asked whether he was pleading guilty because he was guilty and for no other reason, L&#243;pez responded, \"I have another reason ... [t]he <i>Apprendi</i> case.\" At this point, defense counsel interjected, \"What I have told [L&#243;pez] ... is that it is my belief that ... <i>Apprendi</i> can only allow for a sentence up to 20 years....\" Judge Carter conceded the irregularity but noted that the government stood ready to recharge L&#243;pez under an indictment that specified a drug quantity. Judge Carter also pointed out that a superceding indictment could increase the maximum sentence exposure beyond 240 months. Defense counsel then admitted that he had advised L&#243;pez \"from a strategic standpoint\" that it was in his best interest to plead guilty before the government could take such action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After this discussion, the court again asked L&#243;pez if he was pleading guilty because he was guilty. L&#243;pez replied that he was. The court then asked, \"Is the only other reason you have to tender this plea, your desire to limit exposure to the length of the period of incarceration?\" L&#243;pez replied, \"yes.\" After explaining to L&#243;pez the rights that he surrendered by pleading guilty, Judge Carter ascertained that L&#243;pez understood and waived these rights. L&#243;pez was then sentenced to 240 months in prison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the first time on appeal, L&#243;pez now argues that his sentence violated <i>Apprendi</i> because the government was derelict in its duty to charge a drug quantity in the indictment. Finding that this case presents one of the clearest examples of waiver imaginable, we reject L&#243;pez's entreaty.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A party's mere <i>forfeiture,</i> or failure to timely assert a right, does not preclude appellate review for \"plain error\" under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b), but a <i>waiver</i> of a right bars even this highly deferential form of scrutiny. <i>See United States v.

As L&#243;pez stated during the plea colloquy, his attorney had advised him to plead guilty under the present indictment precisely because of the effect of <i>Apprendi.</i> Judge Carter also apprised L&#243;pez of the potential <i>Apprendi</i> issue. Indeed, Judge Carter guaranteed that the sentence imposed would be consistent with <i>Apprendi,</i> and stated that he would allow L&#243;pez to withdraw his guilty plea and proceed to trial if a sentence in excess of 20 years were handed down.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> When the 20-year sentence was announced, L&#243;pez did not object or seek to withdraw his plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, L&#243;pez gained a valuable benefit by acquiescing to the charges in the original indictment. As noted above, the government was prepared to seek a superseding indictment with a specific drug quantity. Had the government done so, L&#243;pez would have doubtlessly faced a harsher sentence. For this reason, L&#243;pez's counsel recognized that, \"from a strategic standpoint,\" L&#243;pez was better off pleading guilty to the original indictment. L&#243;pez also admitted that his plea was based in part on his desire to limit his exposure for purposes of sentencing.

Instead, the Court found that a sentence based on an indictment lacking a specific drug quantity would be reviewed for \"plain error.\" <i>Id.</i> Since we find no valid claim of error to review, L&#243;pez's jurisdictional argument is a non-starter.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The sentence imposed by the district court insured that, even if L&#243;pez's belated<i>Apprendi</i> arguments could be reviewed for \"plain error,\" <i>see</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b), there is simply no \"error\" to correct. The \"default\" or \"catchall\" provision of the statute under which L&#243;pez was charged, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(C), prescribes that a 240-month maximum sentence may be imposed for trafficking even the smallest quantity of cocaine. <i>United States v. L&#243;pez-L&#243;pez,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">282</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 22 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">821</span></span> (2002). Thus, Judge Carter's sentence, set at the upper limit of what is permitted by 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(C), did not violate <i>Apprendi,</i> which \"applies only when the disputed `fact' enlarges the applicable statutory maximum and the defendant's sentence exceeds the original maximum.\" <i>United States v.
