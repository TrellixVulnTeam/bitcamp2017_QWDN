Ramon Peguero-Cruz petitions for\n\nreview of a decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\")\n\ndenying his motion to reopen the deportation proceedings against\n\nhim.1    We dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n             An    immigration     judge      (\"IJ\")   entered    an    order    of\n\ndeportation against Peguero-Cruz in 1990 on the ground that he had\n\nbeen convicted of possessing a controlled substance in violation of\n\nstate law.      See 8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(11) (1990) (current version at\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i) (2005)).             Peguero-Cruz filed a timely\n\nappeal of this order to the BIA, which affirmed in a 1994 decision.\n\nFive    years     later,   in   1999,   Peguero-Cruz     moved   to    reopen   the\n\nproceedings, arguing that he qualified for relief under then-\n\nsection 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"), 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1182(c) (1995) (repealed 1996).               Under this provision,\n\n        [a]liens lawfully admitted for permanent residence who\n        temporarily proceed abroad voluntarily and not under an\n        order of deportation, and who are returning to a lawful\n        unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years, may\n        be admitted in the discretion of the Attorney General\n        without regard to the provisions of subsection (a) of\n        this section [excluding certain aliens from admission].\n\nId.     In spite of this language, \"for reasons buried in the history\n\nof immigration law, § 212(c) relief is available to some legal\n\naliens who have not left the country but who become subject to\n\n\n1\n We say \"deportation\" instead of \"removal\" because the proceedings\nagainst Peguero-Cruz were initiated under a prior version of the\nImmigration and Nationality Act which spoke of \"[p]roceedings to\ndetermine deportability.\"    8 U.S.C. § 1252(b) (1990) (current\nversion at 8 U.S.C. § 1229a (2005 & Supp. 2006)).\n\n                                        -2-\n\fdeportation as a result of criminal convictions.\" United States v.\n\nVieira-Candelario, 6 F.3d 12, 13 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n           Peguero-Cruz argued that he was such an alien, having\n\nbeen admitted as a lawful permanent resident in 1991.           But the BIA\n\ndenied the motion to reopen, ruling that (1) it had not been filed\n\nwithin ninety days of the BIA's decision affirming the deportation\n\norder as required by the Immigration and Naturalization Service's\n\n(INS) rule, 8 C.F.R. § 3.2(c)(1) (2000) (current version at 8\n\nC.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (2006)), and (2) Peguero-Cruz's period of\n\n\"lawful unrelinquished domicile\" had ceased with the finalization\n\nof the deportation order in 1994, before the requisite seven years\n\nfor § 212(c) relief had accrued.\n\n           Peguero-Cruz promptly sought reconsideration, arguing for\n\nthe first time that, while he had not become a lawful permanent\n\nresident until 1991, he had entered the United States without\n\ninspection in 1981, which should be used as the starting point for\n\ncalculating the seven-year period. In a 2001 order, the BIA denied\n\nthe motion, reasoning that Peguero-Cruz's unlawful entry into the\n\ncountry   did   not   commence   a   period   of   \"lawful   unrelinquished\n\ndomicile\" under § 212(c).\n\n           Peguero-Cruz then took an appeal with this court.          In an\n\nunpublished order, we dismissed it under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(C),\n\nwhich deprives us of \"jurisdiction to review any final order of\n\nremoval against an alien who is removable by reason of having\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fcommitted a criminal offense covered in\" § 1227(a)(2)(B).    Peguero\n\nv. INS, No. 01-1574, slip op. (1st Cir. June 22, 2001).2    At that\n\ntime, habeas corpus provided the only means to seek review of such\n\nan order.    INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 314 (2001); Mahadeo v.\n\nReno, 226 F.3d 3, 8 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n            More than three years later, in 2004, Peguero-Cruz filed\n\na \"motion to reconsider decision and reopen proceedings\" with the\n\nBIA, asking it to exercise its authority to \"reopen or reconsider\n\non its own motion any case in which it has rendered a decision.\"\n\n8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).     This time, he argued that his seven year\n\nperiod of \"lawful unrelinquished domicile\" began running with the\n\npassage of the amnesty provisions of the Immigration Reform and\n\nControl Act of 1986.    Pub. L. No. 99-603, § 201(a)(2), 100 Stat.\n\n3359, 3394 (codified as amended at 8 U.S.C. § 1255a (2005)).    The\n\nBIA denied the motion on September 29, 2004, on the ground that INS\n\nrules prohibit an alien from moving for reconsideration more than\n\nonce in the same proceeding.    8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2).    Peguero-\n\nCruz then petitioned this court for review of the BIA's decision,\n\nbut not until more than eight months had passed.\n\n\n\n\n2\n In the alternative, we ruled that one of the \"transitional rules\"\nestablished by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant\nResponsibility Act of 1996, applicable to certain aliens already in\ndeportation proceedings as of the date of its enactment, would have\nthe same jurisdiction-stripping effect. Pub. L. No. 104-208, §\n309(c)(1), (c)(4)(G), 110 Stat. 3009-625 to -626.\n\n                                 -4-\n\f          Under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(1), an alien's \"petition for\n\nreview must be filed not later than thirty days after the date of\n\nthe final order of removal,\" or we lack jurisdiction to hear it.\n\nSee, e.g., De Araujo v. Ashcroft, 399 F.3d 84, 88 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nThe Attorney General urges us to dismiss the petition on this\n\nbasis.   Peguero-Cruz does not question whether the BIA's decision\n\ndenying his motion to reconsider and reopen constitutes a \"final\n\norder of removal\" under § 1252(b)(1), so we assume that it does.3\n\n          Peguero-Cruz argues that the thirty-day time limit on\n\npetitions for review does not apply in his case because, at the\n\ntime the BIA issued its decision, he could not have filed a\n\npetition in this court due to the jurisdiction-stripping provisions\n\nof § 1252(a)(2)(C).    Instead, as we have noted, he could have\n\nsought review only via habeas corpus--but with no concrete time\n\nlimit for doing so.   See, e.g., Medellin-Reyes v. Gonzales, 435\n\nF.3d 721, 723 (7th Cir. 2006).    In the interim, however, the INA\n\nwas amended to provide that § 1252(a)(2)(C) does not \"preclud[e]\n\n\n3\n A number of circuits, albeit mostly in unpublished opinions, have\ndeemed a petition for review of the BIA's order on a motion to\nreopen or reconsider untimely under § 1252(b)(2) when filed more\nthan thirty days afterwards. See McAllister v. Attorney Gen., 444\nF.3d 178, 184-85 (3d Cir. 2006); De Zhu Ou Yang v. Dep't of\nJustice, 174 Fed. Appx. 610, 611 (2d Cir. 2006);          Riwan v.\nGonzales, 171 Fed. Appx. 457, 458 (5th Cir. 2006); Portillo v.\nGonzales, 151 Fed. Appx. 534 (9th Cir. 2005); Anga v. Gonzales, 146\nFed. Appx. 654, 655 (4th Cir. 2005).      While we have treated a\npetition filed within thirty days of such an order as timely, see,\ne.g., Ven v. Ashcroft, 386 F.3d 357, 359-60 (1st Cir. 2004), we\nhave never considered the converse proposition, and do not do so\nhere.\n\n                                 -5-\n\freview of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a\n\npetition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in\n\naccordance with\" § 1252.    REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-13,\n\nDiv. B, § 106(a)(1)(iii), 119 Stat. 231, 310 (codified at 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1252(a)(2)(D)).   This section of the REAL ID Act also made such\n\na petition \"the sole and exclusive means for judicial review of an\n\norder of removal\" and eliminated habeas corpus as a means of\n\nchallenging such an order (with an exception not relevant here).\n\nId., 119 Stat. at 310-11 (codified at 8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(a)(5),\n\n(b)(9)).   And any petitions for habeas corpus \"challenging a final\n\nadministrative order of removal, deportation, or exclusion\" pending\n\nin the district courts at the time the REAL ID Act took effect were\n\ntransferred to the appropriate courts of appeal for review.            Id. §\n\n106(c), 119 Stat. at 311.\n\n           When these provisions became effective, on May 11, 2005,\n\nPeguero-Cruz had yet to exercise his right to file a habeas\n\npetition, and, because more than thirty days had already elapsed\n\nsince the BIA's decision, he could not have filed a timely petition\n\nfor   review.   Peguero-Cruz   argues   that   the   REAL   ID   Act   thus\n\nretroactively eliminated his right to review of the decision and\n\nthat, to avoid this impermissible result, we must judicially extend\n\nthe time limit imposed by the REAL ID Act.           He relies on our\n\ndecision in Rogers v. United States, 180 F.3d 349 (1st Cir. 1999),\n\nwhere we considered the effect of the one-year time limit on\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fpetitions     for   habeas   corpus     relief      from   federal   criminal\n\nconvictions imposed by the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death\n\nPenalty Act (\"AEDPA\"), see 28 U.S.C. § 2255, on petitioners whose\n\nconvictions    became    final   before     AEDPA   became   effective,    and\n\ntherefore had less than the full limitations period to seek relief.\n\n180 F.3d at 355.        We recognized \"that newly-enacted statutes of\n\nlimitation must allow a reasonable time after they take effect for\n\nthe commencement of suit upon existing causes of action\" and that\n\n\"courts traditionally have provided that a 'reasonable time' shall\n\nbe the shorter of (1) the original limitation period, commencing at\n\nthe time the action accrued, or (2) the new, shortened, limitation\n\nperiod, commencing from the date the statute became effective.\"\n\nId. (internal quotation marks omitted).             Applying this rule, we\n\nconcluded that AEDPA's new limitations period, running from the\n\ndate the statute took effect, provided a \"reasonable time\" to\n\npetitioners whose convictions had become final earlier.              Id.\n\n            Peguero-Cruz urges us to take the same approach here,\n\ncommencing the thirty-day limitations period on his petition for\n\nreview at the enactment of the REAL ID Act, rather than at the time\n\nof the BIA's order.        But we recently rejected this argument in\n\nDalombo Fontes v. Gonzales, 483 F.3d 115 (1st Cir. 2007).              There,\n\nwe ruled that, because \"Congress's power to fashion immigration\n\nprocedures is virtually unlimited,\" it need not have provided\n\naliens in Peguero-Cruz's position with the right to seek review in\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fthe courts of appeals.      Id. at 119.       We also noted that, like\n\nPeguero-Cruz, the alien there\n\n      had a liberal length of time, seven months . . . , to\n      have filed for habeas corpus in the district court had he\n      so wished.   Reasonable diligence would have certainly\n      suggested that he seek review within that ample period.\n      Had he done so, his habeas petition would have been\n      transferred . . . .       Congress had understood that\n      district court review proceedings might be pending and\n      had tailored a special provision to let them continue,\n      after transfer, in the courts of appeal. [The petitioner]\n      was entitled to no more. We see no issue of fundamental\n      fairness such as might warrant creating an additional\n      \"grace period\" for the bringing of a review petition\n      under [the REAL ID Act], even assuming the existence of\n      the power to do so.\n\nId.   (footnote omitted).\n\n           The   same   reasoning   applies   with   equal   force   here.\n\nPeguero-Cruz had more than seven months after the BIA's denial of\n\nhis motion, and before the effective date of the REAL ID Act, to\n\nseek review by way of habeas corpus.           As Dalombo Fontes makes\n\nclear, we will not carve out an additional path to judicial review\n\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fwhere Congress has not.4   Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction over\n\nPeguero-Cruz's petition, which is dismissed.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n4\n  We note that Peguero-Cruz has not argued that applying the REAL\nID Act to deprive us of jurisdiction over his petition here would\namount to a violation of the Suspension Clause of the Constitution-\n-an argument that we deemed \"colorable\" in denying the alien's\npetition for panel rehearing in Dalombo Fontes.      F.3d    , 2007\nWL 2306977, at *1 (1st Cir. Aug. 14, 2007). As in that case, then,\n\"we wish to make clear that our holding on the jurisdictional issue\nshould not be read, under principles of stare decisis, as barring\na future panel of this Court, in a case in which the Suspension\nClause issue is timely raised, directly presented, and fully\nbriefed, from considering the import (if any) of the Suspension\nClause with respect to the jurisdictional question. This panel\nintimates no view as to the outcome of such an inquiry.\" Id.\n\n                               -9-\n\f",

This time, he argued that his seven year\n\nperiod of \"lawful unrelinquished domicile\" began running with the\n\npassage of the amnesty provisions of the Immigration Reform and\n\nControl Act of 1986.    Pub. L. No. 99-603, § 201(a)(2), 100 Stat.\n\n3359, 3394 (codified as amended at 8 U.S.C. § 1255a (2005)).    The\n\nBIA denied the motion on September 29, 2004, on the ground that INS\n\nrules prohibit an alien from moving for reconsideration more than\n\nonce in the same proceeding.    8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2).    Peguero-\n\nCruz then petitioned this court for review of the BIA's decision,\n\nbut not until more than eight months had passed.\n\n\n\n\n2\n In the alternative, we ruled that one of the \"transitional rules\"\nestablished by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant\nResponsibility Act of 1996, applicable to certain aliens already in\ndeportation proceedings as of the date of its enactment, would have\nthe same jurisdiction-stripping effect. Pub. L. No. 104-208, §\n309(c)(1), (c)(4)(G), 110 Stat. 3009-625 to -626.\n\n                                 -4-\n\f          Under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(1), an alien's \"petition for\n\nreview must be filed not later than thirty days after the date of\n\nthe final order of removal,\" or we lack jurisdiction to hear it.\n\nSee, e.g., De Araujo v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201466\"><a href=\"/opinion/201466/de-araujo-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">84</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 88 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nThe Attorney General urges us to dismiss the petition on this\n\nbasis.   Peguero-Cruz does not question whether the BIA's decision\n\ndenying his motion to reconsider and reopen constitutes a \"final\n\norder of removal\" under § 1252(b)(1), so we assume that it does.3\n\n          Peguero-Cruz argues that the thirty-day time limit on\n\npetitions for review does not apply in his case because, at the\n\ntime the BIA issued its decision, he could not have filed a\n\npetition in this court due to the jurisdiction-stripping provisions\n\nof § 1252(a)(2)(C).    Instead, as we have noted, he could have\n\nsought review only via habeas corpus--but with no concrete time\n\nlimit for doing so.   See, e.g., Medellin-Reyes v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793061\"><a href=\"/opinion/793061/pedro-medellin-reyes-v-alberto-r-gonzales-attorney-general-of-the-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">721</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 723 (7th Cir. 2006).

See McAllister v. Attorney Gen., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793955\"><a href=\"/opinion/793955/malachy-mcallister-mark-j-mcallister-sarah-b-mcallister-paul-gary/\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">178</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 184-85 (3d Cir. 2006); De Zhu Ou Yang v.

Gonzales, 146\nFed. Appx. 654, 655 (4th Cir. 2005).      While we have treated a\npetition filed within thirty days of such an order as timely, see,\ne.g., Ven v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201300\"><a href=\"/opinion/201300/ven-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">357</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 359-60 (1st Cir. 2004), we\nhave never considered the converse proposition, and do not do so\nhere.\n\n                                 -5-\n\freview of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a\n\npetition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in\n\naccordance with\" § 1252.    REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-13,\n\nDiv. B, § 106(a)(1)(iii), 119 Stat. 231, 310 (codified at 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1252(a)(2)(D)).   This section of the REAL ID Act also made such\n\na petition \"the sole and exclusive means for judicial review of an\n\norder of removal\" and eliminated habeas corpus as a means of\n\nchallenging such an order (with an exception not relevant here).\n\nId., 119 Stat. at 310-11 (codified at 8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(a)(5),\n\n(b)(9)).   And any petitions for habeas corpus \"challenging a final\n\nadministrative order of removal, deportation, or exclusion\" pending\n\nin the district courts at the time the REAL ID Act took effect were\n\ntransferred to the appropriate courts of appeal for review.            Id. §\n\n106(c), 119 Stat. at 311.\n\n           When these provisions became effective, on May 11, 2005,\n\nPeguero-Cruz had yet to exercise his right to file a habeas\n\npetition, and, because more than thirty days had already elapsed\n\nsince the BIA's decision, he could not have filed a timely petition\n\nfor   review.   Peguero-Cruz   argues   that   the   REAL   ID   Act   thus\n\nretroactively eliminated his right to review of the decision and\n\nthat, to avoid this impermissible result, we must judicially extend\n\nthe time limit imposed by the REAL ID Act.           He relies on our\n\ndecision in Rogers v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764813\"><a href=\"/opinion/764813/no-98-2215/\"><span class=\"volume\">180</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">349</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1999),\n\nwhere we considered the effect of the one-year time limit on\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fpetitions     for   habeas   corpus     relief      from   federal   criminal\n\nconvictions imposed by the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death\n\nPenalty Act (\"AEDPA\"), see 28 U.S.C. § 2255, on petitioners whose\n\nconvictions    became    final   before     AEDPA   became   effective,    and\n\ntherefore had less than the full limitations period to seek relief.\n\n180 F.3d at 355.        We recognized \"that newly-enacted statutes of\n\nlimitation must allow a reasonable time after they take effect for\n\nthe commencement of suit upon existing causes of action\" and that\n\n\"courts traditionally have provided that a 'reasonable time' shall\n\nbe the shorter of (1) the original limitation period, commencing at\n\nthe time the action accrued, or (2) the new, shortened, limitation\n\nperiod, commencing from the date the statute became effective.\"\n\nId. (internal quotation marks omitted).             Applying this rule, we\n\nconcluded that AEDPA's new limitations period, running from the\n\ndate the statute took effect, provided a \"reasonable time\" to\n\npetitioners whose convictions had become final earlier.              Id.\n\n            Peguero-Cruz urges us to take the same approach here,\n\ncommencing the thirty-day limitations period on his petition for\n\nreview at the enactment of the REAL ID Act, rather than at the time\n\nof the BIA's order.        But we recently rejected this argument in\n\nDalombo Fontes v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202683\"><a href=\"/opinion/202683/fontes-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">115</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 2007).              There,\n\nwe ruled that, because \"Congress's power to fashion immigration\n\nprocedures is virtually unlimited,\" it need not have provided\n\naliens in Peguero-Cruz's position with the right to seek review in\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fthe courts of appeals.      Id. at 119.       We also noted that, like\n\nPeguero-Cruz, the alien there\n\n      had a liberal length of time, seven months . . . , to\n      have filed for habeas corpus in the district court had he\n      so wished.   Reasonable diligence would have certainly\n      suggested that he seek review within that ample period.\n      Had he done so, his habeas petition would have been\n      transferred . . . .       Congress had understood that\n      district court review proceedings might be pending and\n      had tailored a special provision to let them continue,\n      after transfer, in the courts of appeal. [The petitioner]\n      was entitled to no more. We see no issue of fundamental\n      fairness such as might warrant creating an additional\n      \"grace period\" for the bringing of a review petition\n      under [the REAL ID Act], even assuming the existence of\n      the power to do so.\n\nId.   (footnote omitted).\n\n           The   same   reasoning   applies   with   equal   force   here.\n\nPeguero-Cruz had more than seven months after the BIA's denial of\n\nhis motion, and before the effective date of the REAL ID Act, to\n\nseek review by way of habeas corpus.           As Dalombo Fontes makes\n\nclear, we will not carve out an additional path to judicial review\n\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fwhere Congress has not.4   Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction over\n\nPeguero-Cruz's petition, which is dismissed.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n4\n  We note that Peguero-Cruz has not argued that applying the REAL\nID Act to deprive us of jurisdiction over his petition here would\namount to a violation of the Suspension Clause of the Constitution-\n-an argument that we deemed \"colorable\" in denying the alien's\npetition for panel rehearing in Dalombo Fontes.
