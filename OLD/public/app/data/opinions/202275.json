Green and Monica E.\nConyngham, City of Quincy Solicitor's Office were on brief, for\nappellant/cross-appellee.\n     Marisa A. Campagna for appellee/cross-appellant.\n\n\n\n                            June 23, 2006\n\f            HOWARD, Circuit Judge. A jury sitting in the District of\n\nMassachusetts      found       that    the    City    of     Quincy,      Massachusetts,\n\nviolated Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e,\n\net seq., and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, by unlawfully retaliating\n\nagainst police officer John McDonough for assisting a fellow\n\nofficer in pursuing an employment discrimination claim.                              The jury\n\nawarded McDonough $300,000 in compensatory damages.                             The parties\n\ncross-appealed.          The    City    challenges         the     verdict      on    several\n\ngrounds,   including       that       the    action    was       barred    by    the   claim\n\npreclusion doctrine and that the evidence was insufficient to\n\nsupport the verdict.            McDonough challenges the district court's\n\nrefusal to instruct the jury on awarding punitive damages.                                 We\n\nreject   the    City's     appeal      but    remand       for    further       proceedings\n\nconcerning punitive damages.\n\n                                      I. Background\n\n            We present the facts in the light most favorable to the\n\nverdict,       reserving       certain        details        for     the        discussion.\n\nSee Grajales-Romero v. Am. Airlines, Inc., 194 F.3d 288, 292 (1st\n\nCir. 1999). McDonough joined the Quincy Police Department in 1969,\n\nsubsequently held various ranks and was promoted to lieutenant in\n\n1984.    In 1990 he was assigned to command the drug unit, where he\n\nhas remained since.\n\n            In 1997, McDonough wrote to the then mayor of Quincy,\n\nJames    Sheets,    questioning         certain       decisions       made       by    police\n\n\n                                             -2-\n\fdepartment management. In response, Sheets arranged a meeting with\n\nMcDonough to discuss his grievances.            At the meeting, McDonough\n\npresented Sheets with a packet of materials highlighting his\n\nconcerns.     One page of the packet included a compilation of\n\nallegations that McDonough had heard from other officers about\n\nsexual harassment by department employees against police officer\n\nNancy Coletta.    Sheets took no action on the Coletta matter.\n\n            In late 1999, McDonough learned from other officers that\n\nColetta was planning to file a sexual harassment lawsuit against\n\nthe City.     McDonough did not know Coletta but wanted to help her\n\npursue her claim.        He therefore provided Susan Perch, another\n\nofficer who knew Coletta, with a copy of the page of allegations\n\nthat   he   previously   had   presented   to     Sheets.     This    page   of\n\nallegations was eventually given to Coletta.\n\n            On April 25, 2000, the Massachusetts Commission Against\n\nDiscrimination held a hearing on Coletta's claim against the City.\n\nCaptain William Falco, then administrative assistant to Chief of\n\nPolice Thomas Frane, attended the hearing at Frane's request.                At\n\nthe hearing, Coletta presented the hearing officer with the page of\n\nallegations    that   McDonough   had    passed    to   her   and    mentioned\n\nMcDonough's name.\n\n            After the hearing, Falco reported to Frane about the\n\nhearing and indicated that the \"police department . . . or city had\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fsome problems\" because of Coletta's suit.          Frane instructed Falco\n\nto investigate the matter further.\n\n           On May 5th, Falco contacted McDonough to discuss the page\n\nof   allegations    that   Coletta   had    presented   at    the   hearing.\n\nMcDonough explained that he had given it to Mayor Sheets in 1997\n\nand that, if Falco wanted to obtain a copy, he could contact the\n\nmayor's office.     Falco unsuccessfully attempted to obtain the page\n\nfrom the mayor's office.\n\n           The members of the drug unit, including McDonough, worked\n\nthe night shift and as compensation received fifteen percent higher\n\npay than day-shift employees.        Three days after Falco talked to\n\nMcDonough about the Coletta matter, Frane reassigned McDonough to\n\nthe day shift.      As a result, McDonough lost the pay differential\n\nand was essentially stripped of his supervisory duties because the\n\nofficers he supervised worked on the alternate shift.           At the time\n\nthat McDonough was reassigned, another officer was placed in the\n\ndrug   unit   and     assumed   most       of   McDonough's    supervisory\n\nresponsibilities.\n\n           Shortly after the reassignment was announced, McDonough,\n\nwho was on medical leave at that time, called Frane to inquire\n\nabout the transfer.     Frane told him that he had ordered it because\n\nMcDonough had \"trouble communicating.\"          When McDonough objected to\n\nthis characterization, Frane told him \"in everyone's life a little\n\nrain must fall.      You can always retire.\"         On another occasion,\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fFrane told McDonough that he placed him on the day shift because\n\nseveral city councilors had indicated that they wanted to increase\n\nfunding for the drug unit and that he wanted McDonough available to\n\nanswer questions from the councilors.         At trial, Frane testified\n\nthat he had transferred McDonough as part of a department-wide\n\nreorganization and because he wanted to better integrate McDonough\n\ninto the department's management team.\n\n          McDonough returned from his medical leave in August 2000\n\nand assumed day-shift duties, where he \"had no one to supervise\"\n\nand \"nothing to do.\"    He served in this role without significant\n\nincident until March 8, 2001, when he signed several \"court slips\"\n\n(authorizing extra pay for officers required to attend court\n\nproceedings) for officers of the drug unit.       McDonough learned the\n\nnext day that the court slips that he had signed were denied\n\nbecause he no longer was authorized to sign such slips.\n\n          McDonough    immediately   called    acting   Chief   of   Police\n\nTerrence Kelly (Chief Frane was on a leave of absence after\n\nsuffering a heart attack; he never returned to his position) to\n\nask why the court slips were denied.       Kelly told him that Captain\n\nRobert   Crowley,   McDonough's   direct      supervisor,   had      removed\n\nMcDonough's signing authority. McDonough proceeded to explain that\n\nthe drug unit was investigating Crowley for potential corruption\n\nand that Kelly therefore had to overrule Crowley's order.             Kelly\n\nrefused, and McDonough \"very heatedly screamed at him\" that he\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fwould go to the newspapers and city hall if Kelly did not act.\n\nMcDonough gave Kelly a short deadline to change his position before\n\nKelly hung up the phone.             After this conversation, Kelly described\n\nto Falco the heated exchange with McDonough and told Falco that he\n\nwas afraid that McDonough might suffer a heart attack.1                        But Kelly\n\ntook no immediate action.\n\n               Immediately thereafter, McDonough authored a letter to\n\nKevin       Madden,    the      director    of   personnel     for    the    department,\n\nalerting       him    to    the   court-slip       incident    and    other   workplace\n\ngrievances.          McDonough stated that he had given relevant documents\n\nto another officer to be used in the case of his \"sudden or\n\nsuspicious death.\"\n\n               After Madden received this letter, he met with Kelly and\n\nFalco to discuss the situation.                    It was agreed that McDonough\n\nshould be placed on paid administrative leave and that his service\n\nweapon should be taken pending a fitness-for-duty evaluation by a\n\nmental health provider.\n\n               After the meeting, Kelly and Falco summoned McDonough to\n\nKelly's       office       to   inform     him   that   he    was    being    placed   on\n\nadministrative leave. They then took his firearm and told him that\n\nhe had to leave the police headquarters immediately and could not\n\nreturn unless and until he passed a mental health evaluation.\n\n\n\n        1\n      It was well-known in the department that McDonough had a\nheart condition.\n\n                                             -6-\n\fAfter McDonough was placed on leave, no one from the department\n\nchecked to make sure that McDonough had no other weapons in his\n\npossession, contacted McDonough's family to alert them to the\n\nconcerns about his mental health, or arranged to ensure that\n\nMcDonough made it home safely.\n\n             McDonough     subsequently    met   with   a   psychiatrist   who\n\nconcluded that McDonough was fit to return to his post.              McDonough\n\nreturned to his day-shift position in May 2001 and several weeks\n\nlater was returned to the night shift by Falco, who in the interim\n\nhad been appointed chief.\n\n             In October 2001, McDonough filed this action claiming\n\nthat   the    City   had    retaliated    against   him     by,   inter   alia,\n\ntransferring him to the day shift and placing him on administrative\n\nleave.   After a five-day trial, the court submitted the case to the\n\njury but declined to allow the jury to consider awarding punitive\n\ndamages.     The jury returned a general verdict for McDonough and\n\nawarded him $300,000 in lost wages and emotional distress damages.\n\nThe City moved for judgment as a matter of law on the ground that\n\nMcDonough had not presented sufficient evidence to ground the\n\njury's retaliation finding and, alternatively, moved to have the\n\ndamage award remitted.        The district court denied the motion and\n\nentered judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f                         II. The City's Appeal\n\n           A.     Claim Preclusion\n\n           The City asserts that McDonough's action should have been\n\ndismissed as it was barred under the claim preclusion doctrine as\n\na result of an unsuccessful Massachusetts state court action that\n\nMcDonough filed against the City in 1999.     In 1998, McDonough was\n\npassed over for promotion to police captain and subsequently sued\n\nthe City in Massachusetts Superior Court, claiming that he had been\n\ndenied the promotion in retaliation for his complaint to Sheets in\n\n1997.    The case went to trial in 2003, and a state court judge\n\nentered judgment for the City at the close of McDonough's case-in-\n\nchief.    The City argues that the state and federal actions are\n\nidentical and that the federal action is therefore barred.        It\n\nbases this argument on a foundational assertion that both cases\n\ncenter on the page of Coletta allegations that McDonough first\n\npresented to Sheets at their 1997 meeting.\n\n           The district court rejected this argument on the ground\n\nthat the federal and state actions are distinct.    The court viewed\n\nthe state action as based primarily on the alleged retaliatory\n\nconduct by Sheets after the 1997 meeting, while the federal action\n\nis based primarily on retaliation perpetrated by members of the\n\ndepartment after McDonough helped Coletta in 1999.     We review this\n\ndetermination de novo.    See   Maher v. GSI Lumonics, Inc., 433 F.3d\n\n123, 126 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\f            \"Under federal law, a federal court must give to a state-\n\ncourt judgment the same preclusive effect as would be given that\n\njudgment under the law of the state in which that judgment was\n\nentered.\"      Torromeo v. Fremont, 438 F.3d 113, 115 (1st Cir. 2006)\n\n(internal citations omitted).           Thus, the effect the Massachusetts\n\ncourt's   final    judgment      has    on   McDonough's    federal    action     is\n\ndetermined by applying the Massachusetts law of claim preclusion.\n\nId.\n\n               Claim preclusion doctrine in Massachusetts \"prohibits\n\nthe maintenance of an action based on the same claim that was the\n\nsubject of an earlier action between the same parties or their\n\nprivies.\"      Bagley v. Moxley, 555 N.E.2d 229, 231 (Mass. 1990).\n\n\"[C]laim preclusion makes a valid final judgment conclusive on the\n\nparties or privies, and bars further litigation of all matters that\n\nwere or should have been adjudicated in the action.\"                  Id.    \"There\n\nare three essential elements to the doctrine of claim preclusion:\n\n(1) the identity or privity of the parties to the present and prior\n\nactions; (2) identity of the cause[s] of action; and (3) a prior\n\nfinal judgment on the merits.\"               Bui v. Ma, 818 N.E.2d 572, 579\n\n(Mass. App. Ct. 2004).           Causes of action are identical if they\n\n\"derive[]   from    the   same     transaction     or   series   of    connected\n\ntransactions.\"      TLT Const. Corp. v. A. Anthony Tappe, 716 N.E.2d\n\n1044,   1052    (Mass.    App.    Ct.    1999).     \"What    factual        grouping\n\nconstitutes a transaction is to be determined pragmatically, giving\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\fweight to such factors as         whether the facts are related in time,\n\nspace and origin or motivation, whether they form a convenient\n\ntrial unit, and whether their treatment as a unit conforms to the\n\nparties' expectations.\"         Mancuso v. Kinchla, 806 N.E.2d 427, 438\n\n(Mass. App. Ct. 2004).\n\n            There is no question that the parties to the state and\n\nfederal actions are the same and that the state action resulted in\n\na final judgment on the merits adverse to McDonough.                   Thus, the\n\nonly   issue    is    whether   the    causes    of   action   share   sufficient\n\nidentity.\n\n            We agree with the district court that they do not.                The\n\ntransaction on which the state action was based was McDonough's\n\nfailure to be appointed captain in 1998, which he attributed to\n\nretaliation     orchestrated      by    Sheets    for   exercising     his   First\n\nAmendment rights in 1997.         The transactions on which the federal\n\nsuit is based were McDonough's transfer and his placement on\n\nadministrative leave, which he claims were ordered by members of\n\nthe department after they learned in 2000 that he had assisted\n\nColetta in her lawsuit.           McDonough's suits against the City were\n\npremised on separate acts of protected conduct that occurred years\n\napart. Moreover, the allegedly retaliatory actions were ordered by\n\ndifferent      City    agents   over    a   several     year   period.       These\n\ndifferences support the district court's ruling that the federal\n\naction is not barred.       See, e.g., Gonzalez-Pina v. Rodriguez, 407\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fF.3d       425,    430   (1st   Cir.   2005)   (concluding,   in   an   employment\n\ndiscrimination case, that \"subsequent conduct, even if it is of the\n\nsame nature as the conduct complained of in a prior lawsuit, may\n\ngive rise to an entirely separate cause of action\"); Herrmann v.\n\nCencom Cable Assocs. Inc., 999 F.2d 223, 226 (7th Cir. 1993)\n\n(Posner, J.) (concluding that claim preclusion did not bar two\n\ntangentially related employment claims because the essential facts\n\nunderlying the claims were distinct); Manning v. City of Auburn,\n\n953 F.2d 1355, 1359 (11th Cir. 1992) (ruling that claim preclusion\n\ndid not bar a second employment discrimination claim, where the\n\nfacts underlying the second suit had not occurred when the first\n\nsuit was filed).2\n\n                  The page of allegations that McDonough gave to Sheets\n\nwas, of course, relevant evidence in each case.                But the district\n\ncourt correctly recognized that this is too tenuous a connection to\n\nwarrant a finding of claim preclusion and to deprive McDonough of\n\nhis day in court.          See Herrmann, 999 F.2d at 226 (refusing to find\n\nclaim preclusion when the claims had only limited shared facts);\n\nsee also Andersen v. Chrysler Corp., 99 F.3d 846, 853 (7th Cir.\n\n1996) (cautioning that a claim preclusion analysis should not\n\n\n\n       2\n      In addition, the causes of action do not present a convenient\ntrial unit. The key witnesses for the state action were Sheets and\nMcDonough, while the federal action required several department\nwitnesses and substantial documentary evidence about police\ndepartment procedure and policies. See Catullo v. Metzner, 834\nF.2d 1075, 1078 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\n                                          -11-\n\fproceed at too high a level of generality because of the risk of\n\nunfairly precluding a litigant from having her day in court).\n\n           B. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n           The City argues that it was entitled to judgment as a\n\nmatter of law because McDonough failed to present sufficient\n\nevidence to warrant the jury's retaliation finding. It claims that\n\nthe evidence demonstrates, at most, that the actions taken against\n\nMcDonough \"were based on personal conflicts with [City] officials,\"\n\nand that such evidence is inadequate to sustain a retaliation\n\nverdict.   The district court rejected this argument, concluding\n\nthat there was sufficient proof from which a jury could infer that\n\nthe City's actions against McDonough were motivated by retaliatory\n\nanimus stemming from his assisting Coletta.\n\n           We review de novo the denial of the City's motion for\n\njudgment as a matter of law, see Marrero v. Goya of P.R., 304 F.3d\n\n7, 14 (1st Cir. 2002), and we examine the evidence presented at\n\ntrial in the light most favorable to McDonough.       See White v. N.H.\n\nDep't of Corr., 221 F.3d 254, 259 (1st Cir. 2000).          We \"may not\n\nconsider   the   credibility   of   witnesses,   resolve   conflicts   in\n\ntestimony or evaluate the weight of the evidence.\"         Katz v. City\n\nMetal Co., 87 F.3d 26, 28 (1st Cir. 1996).       Our review \"is weighted\n\ntoward preservation of the jury's verdict, for we must affirm\n\nunless the evidence was so strongly and overwhelmingly inconsistent\n\nwith the verdict[] that no reasonable jury could have returned\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\f[it].\"    Crowley v. L.L. Bean, Inc., 303 F.3d 387, 393 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).\n\n               The jury was instructed to consider McDonough's claim\n\nunder    the     McDonnell-Douglas      burden-shifting         framework.          See\n\nMcDonnell-Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973).                             Under\n\nMcDonnell-Douglas, the plaintiff must make a prima facie showing\n\nthat (i) he engaged in protected conduct, (ii) he was thereafter\n\nsubject   to     an    adverse   employment       action,    and    (iii)    a    causal\n\nconnection exists between the protected conduct and the adverse\n\naction.          See     Ramirez    Rodriguez       v.      Boehringer       Ingelheim\n\nPharmaceuticals, Inc., 425 F.3d 67, 84 (1st Cir. 2005).                          If the\n\nplaintiff makes this showing, the burden of production shifts to\n\nthe defendant to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason\n\nfor its employment decision.            See id.      Finally, if the defendant\n\npresents such a reason, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the\n\ndefendant's       proffered        reason    is     pretext        masking       illegal\n\nretaliation.          See id.    Evidence that the defendant's reason was\n\npretext may, but need not, ground a finding of liability.                        Fite v.\n\nDigital Equip. Corp., 232 F.3d 3, 7 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n               The City has not presented in its main brief a developed\n\nargument that McDonough failed to establish a prima facie case of\n\nretaliation.          It focuses instead on the evidence that McDonough\n\npresented to undermine the City's asserted reasons for taking the\n\nchallenged employment actions.              As discussed above, the jury was\n\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\fpresented       with    two    adverse     employment      actions:            McDonough's\n\nreassignment to the day shift and his placement on administrative\n\nleave. We consider whether McDonough presented sufficient evidence\n\nof pretext such that the jury could conclude that retaliation was\n\nthe real motive for each of the challenged actions.3\n\n               Chief Frane ordered McDonough's transfer to the day shift\n\nwithin days of learning that McDonough had assisted Coletta in\n\npursuing her sex discrimination claim.                  At trial, the City claimed\n\nthat       Frane's   decision       to   transfer       McDonough       was    part    of   a\n\ndepartment-wide             reorganization        and     that     the        timing    was\n\ncoincidental.\n\n               There is \"no mechanical formula\" for determining pretext,\n\nChe v. Mass. Bay Transp. Auth., 342 F.3d 31, 39 (1st Cir. 2003)\n\n(internal citation omitted), and we have recognized that pretext\n\ncan be proven in many ways, see Santiago-Ramos v. Centennial P.R.\n\nWireless Corp., 217 F.3d 46, 55 (1st Cir. 2000).                          One way is for\n\nthe    plaintiff       to    show   that   the    employer       gave    \"different     and\n\narguably       inconsistent         explanations\"        for     taking       the   adverse\n\nemployment action.            Dominguez-Cruz v. Suttle Caribe, Inc.,                    202\n\nF.3d 424, 432 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n\n\n       3\n      The City does not argue that these actions were insufficient\nto establish a retaliation claim on the basis that they were not\nsevere enough \"to dissuade a reasonable worker from making or\nsupporting a charge of discrimination.\"     Burlington Northern &\nSanta Fe Railway v. White, 548 U.S. --, 2006 WL 1698953, at *10\n(June 22, 2006).\n\n                                           -14-\n\f          Here, there was evidence that Frane provided several,\n\narguably inconsistent, explanations for transferring McDonough.\n\nWhen McDonough first confronted Frane about the transfer, Frane\n\ntold him that it was because he had \"trouble communicating\" and\n\nthat, if he did not like it, he \"could retire.\"            Several months\n\nlater,   when   McDonough   again    asked   Frane   why   he   had   been\n\ntransferred, Frane stated that \"some city councilors wanted to put\n\nadditional funding into the drug unit,\" and that the transfer was\n\nintended to help secure this funding.        At trial, Frane testified\n\nthat the transfer was part of a \"major transformation\" of the\n\ndepartment and that it was designed to integrate McDonough into the\n\ndepartment's management team. These shifting explanations provided\n\na basis for the jury to conclude that the reason the City presented\n\nat trial was false.\n\n            Moreover, there was testimony from two police captains,\n\nwho attended management meetings with Chief Frane just before the\n\ntransfer, that there was no discussion of restructuring the drug\n\nunit.    The jury could have concluded that this evidence was\n\ninconsistent with the City's contention that the transfer decision\n\nwas a part of a systemic restructuring process.            See Reeves v.\n\nSanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 143 (2000) (stating\n\nthat a jury can find pretext where \"the employer's proffered\n\nexplanation is unworthy of credence\").\n\n\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\f            There also was evidence from which the jury could have\n\nfound pretext masking retaliation in the City's claim that it\n\nplaced McDonough on administrative leave because it perceived him\n\nto be a safety risk.     Acting Chief Kelly, the person who decided to\n\nplace McDonough on leave, testified that it was common knowledge\n\nthat McDonough often became highly emotional but that he would\n\nquickly calm down. This testimony was given during Kelly's account\n\nof his conversation with McDonough that led him to be primarily\n\nconcerned that McDonough might have a heart attack. Kelly admitted\n\nthat he did not perceive McDonough to be a safety threat when this\n\nconversation    occurred.          Moreover,    no   one   in    the   department\n\ninvestigated McDonough's letter to Madden to determine the basis\n\nand motivation for his statements.             From this evidence, the jury\n\ncould infer that Kelly, Madden, and Falco used McDonough's phone\n\ncall and letter to establish a pretextual safety rationale for the\n\ndecision to put McDonough on administrative leave.\n\n            In addition, a jury could view the actions that Kelly and\n\nFalco took when they informed McDonough that he was being placed on\n\nleave as tending to undermine the asserted safety rationale. Falco\n\ntestified   that   he   was   so    concerned    about     the   possibility   of\n\nMcDonough becoming violent that he wore a bullet-proof vest to the\n\nmeeting at which Kelly informed McDonough of the decision to place\n\nhim on leave.      But Kelly did not take any such precautions for\n\nhimself or his secretary who was sitting directly outside of the\n\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fdoor to the office in which the meeting was held.              Nor did Kelly or\n\nFalco arrange to have an officer on alert in case the meeting\n\nturned violent.        And, after the meeting, no one at the department\n\nchecked to see if McDonough had other weapons in his possession,\n\nalerted McDonough's family that he was a potential danger to\n\nhimself or others, or arranged to ensure that McDonough traveled\n\nhome safely.      Indeed, the next contact between the department and\n\nMcDonough did not occur until several days later, when someone from\n\nthe department called to provide him with the details of his\n\nfitness-for-duty        evaluation.         Though    the    inference      is    not\n\ninevitable, the jury reasonably could have concluded that this is\n\nnot how experienced police officers would have handled placing an\n\nofficer on leave if they truly believed that he posed a safety\n\nrisk.    See Hodgens v. Gen. Dynamics Corp., 144 F.3d 151, 167 (1st\n\nCir.    1998)    (stating      that   pretext   may   be    proven    by    showing\n\n\"weaknesses, implausibilities, incoherencies, or contradictions in\n\nthe employer's proffered legitimate reasons\").\n\n            In    assessing      pretext,      \"everything    depends       on   the\n\nindividual facts.\"           Thomas v. Eastman Kodak Co., 183 F.3d 38, 57\n\n(1st Cir. 1999).        As such, we are \"particularly cautious\" about\n\nsetting aside a jury's determinations that an employer's proffered\n\nexplanation      was     pretext.         Hodgens,      144    F.3d        at    167.\n\n\"Determinations         of     motive    and     intent,      particularly        in\n\ndiscrimination cases, are questions better suited for the jury.\"\n\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\fMulero-Rodriguez v. Ponte, 98 F.3d 670, 677 (1st Cir. 1996). While\n\nthe jury could have accepted the City's explanations for its\n\nactions, we cannot say that it was irrational for the jury to have\n\nconcluded     that     the    explanations    were    pretextual   and   that\n\nretaliation was the motivation for the City's actions.4\n\n            C.         Trial-Error Claims\n\n                       1.     Evidentiary Claims\n\n            The City challenges several evidentiary rulings.              We\n\nreview these claims for an abuse of discretion.               See Ramirez v.\n\nDebs-Elias,      407   F.3d    444,   449   (1st   Cir.   2005).   Erroneous\n\nevidentiary rulings are harmless if it is highly probable that the\n\nerror did not affect the outcome of the case.                 See Rodriguez-\n\nHernandez v. Miranda-Velez, 132 F.3d 848, 855 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n            The City's first claim is that the district court abused\n\nits discretion by declining to allow it to introduce evidence that\n\nMcDonough had lost his previous lawsuit against the City.5                See\n\nsupra at 8.       The City argues that this evidence was relevant\n\nbecause it showed that McDonough was litigious and had a history of\n\nbringing meritless lawsuits.\n\n\n     4\n      We also reject the City's contention that we should order a\nnew trial. As discussed above, the evidence was adequate for the\njury to find retaliation. See Marrero, 304 F.3d at 14 (stating\nthat a new trial should only be ordered if \"the outcome is against\nthe clear weight of the evidence such that upholding the verdict\nwill result in a miscarriage of justice\").\n     5\n      The court did allow the City to introduce the fact that there\nwas a prior lawsuit between McDonough and the City.\n\n                                      -18-\n\f              Because the \"charge of litigiousness is a serious one,\n\nlikely to result in undue prejudice against the party charged[,]\"\n\nOutley v. City of New York,          837 F.2d 587, 592 (2d Cir. 1988),\n\nordinarily proof that the plaintiff filed prior similar lawsuits is\n\nadmissible to show the plaintiff's litigiousness only if there is\n\nalso evidence that the prior lawsuits were fraudulently filed,\n\nsee McCormick on Evidence, ยง 196 at 691 (5th ed. 1999).                        Here,\n\nthere is evidence that McDonough filed one prior lawsuit against\n\nthe City after he was denied a promotion.           But, while that lawsuit\n\nwas   unsuccessful,    there    is    nothing     suggesting      that    it    was\n\nfraudulently filed.       See Mathis v. Phillips Chevrolet, Inc., 269\n\nF.3d 771, 776-77 (7th Cir. 2001) (concluding that there was no\n\nabuse   of   discretion   in   declining     to   admit    evidence      of    prior\n\nlawsuits where the evidence was in dispute whether the prior suits\n\nwere fraudulently brought or merely unsuccessful).                The district\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in excluding evidence about the\n\nresult of McDonough's prior lawsuit against the City.\n\n             The City next contends that the district court improperly\n\nprecluded it from questioning McDonough about his contentious\n\nrelationship with the mayor and the police department. We disagree\n\nwith the City's characterization of the district court's ruling.\n\nThe   City   was   permitted   to    ask    McDonough     about   his    strained\n\nrelationships with certain department officials, to introduce the\n\nfact that McDonough had sued the City on a prior occasion, and to\n\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\fpresent documents highlighting various points of dispute between\n\nMcDonough and the department.       The ruling in question involved the\n\ncourt telling the City to \"move on\" after counsel had asked\n\nMcDonough several repetitive questions about his relationship with\n\nCaptain Falco.\n\n           Under Fed. R. Evid. 403, the district court retains\n\ndiscretion to \"prevent the needless presentation of cumulative\n\nevidence.\"      Donovan v. Burger King Corp., 672 F.2d 221, 225 (1st\n\nCir. 1982).     The court provided the City with ample opportunity to\n\nhighlight McDonough's sour relationship with the City.                It was\n\nwithin the court's discretion to draw the line where it did.\n\n           The    City's   third   evidentiary   argument      is   that   the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion by permitting McDonough to\n\npresent a chalk to the jury stating that Coletta had settled her\n\nlawsuit for $500,000.       Even if this information should not have\n\nbeen presented to the jury, the City did not timely object to the\n\nchalk, and the court sua sponte explained that the jury should not\n\ninfer anything from the amount of the Coletta settlement. \"We have\n\nheld, [that] the potential for prejudice . . . [often] can be\n\nsatisfactorily dispelled by appropriate curative instructions,\" as\n\n\"[j]urors are presumed to follow such instructions, except in\n\nextreme cases.\"     United States v. Richardson, 421 F.3d 17, 41 (1st\n\nCir.   2005).      Given   the   tangential   relevance   of   the   Coletta\n\n\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\fsettlement and the court's timely limiting instruction, we are\n\nconfident that the verdict was not swayed by the chalk.\n\n           Finally   the      City   argues       the    district    court    wrongly\n\nadmitted out-of-court statements by Falco and Madden concerning the\n\ndecision to place McDonough on administrative leave.                         The City\n\ncontends that these statements were hearsay and could not be\n\nreceived as admissions under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(D) because the\n\ndeclarants were not \"policymakers,\" (which the City would limit in\n\nthis case to the chief of police and the mayor).\n\n           For a statement to be an admission under Fed. R. Evid.\n\n801(d)(2)(D), it must be made by a party, a party's agent, or a\n\nservant within the scope of an agency or employment.                   See Gomez v.\n\nRivera Rodriguez, 344 F.3d 103, 116 (1st Cir. 2003). The employee's\n\nstation   within   the   organization        is    not    relevant    to     the   Rule\n\n801(d)(2) analysis.        See Woodman v. Haemonetics Corp., 51 F.3d\n\n1087, 1093-94 (1st Cir. 1995) (rejecting argument that statements\n\nby \"first-line supervisor\" with no firing authority could not be\n\nadmissions under Rule 801(d)(2)(D)).                    The relevant inquiry is\n\nwhether the employee's statement was made within the scope of\n\nemployment.   See id.\n\n           Here, there is no question that Falco and Madden made the\n\nchallenged statements within the scope of their employment.                        Both\n\nwere department officials involved in personnel management, and the\n\nstatements    related    to     a    possible      personnel        action    against\n\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\fMcDonough. See id. (concluding that statement by employee involved\n\nin the plaintiff's termination was admissible under Fed. R. Evid.\n\n801(d)(2)(D)).      The statements were properly admitted.6\n\n                     2.      Jury Instruction\n\n             In   addition    to    challenging     the   transfer    and   leave\n\ndecisions, McDonough presented evidence that he was subject to\n\nadverse employment actions by being denied the use of a department\n\ncar, by not having his supervisory responsibility restored after he\n\nwas returned to the night shift, and by being denied the authority\n\nto sign court slips.      After the close of the evidence, the district\n\ncourt directed a verdict for the City on these claims and only\n\npermitted the jury to consider the transfer and leave allegations.\n\nThe   City   contends     that     the   district   court's   charge    did   not\n\nadequately explain that McDonough's claim was limited to those\n\nallegations.      We review this claim for abuse of discretion.               See\n\nSanchez-Lopez v. Fuentes-Pujols, 375 F.3d 121, 133 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n             The court's instructions were more than adequate to\n\nexplain the nature of McDonough's claims.             The court explained:\n\n             [T]his    case   [is]     grounded   in            two\n             incidents.     One,   the   transfer  of           Mr.\n\n\n      6\n      The City also challenges the propriety of McDonough's closing\nargument.   It did not, however, object below, and therefore we\nreview for plain error. See Santos v. Sunrise Med. Ctr., 351 F.3d\n587, 592-593 (1st Cir. 2003). There was no such error, for there\nis no reason to think that any of the challenged statements came\nclose to causing the City substantial prejudice.      See Smith v.\nKmart Corp., 177 F.3d 19, 25-26 (1st Cir. 1999) (describing plain\nerror as \"a rare species in civil litigation\").\n\n                                 -22-\n\f          McDonough . . . from nights to days .\n          . . and later on a determination that\n          he was to surrender his firearms and stay\n          on administrative leave until he went to\n          a   psychiatrist   and  was  certified for\n          duty in that period of time.\n\nLater, the court instructed that \"this case is about\" McDonough\n\nbeing \"taken from nights and placed on days\" and being placed on\n\n\"administrative leave.\" The instructions were more than sufficient\n\nto apprise the jury of the actionable theories.\n\n          D.       Damages\n\n          The   City   argues   that    the   district   court   erred   by\n\ndeclining to reduce McDonough's $300,000 damages award because the\n\naward was \"grossly excessive\" and \"shocking to the conscience.\" We\n\nreview the district court's denial of remittitur for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.    See Gasperini v. Ctr. for Humanities, Inc., 518 U.S.\n\n415, 433 (1996).   \"We will not disturb an award of damages because\n\nit is extremely generous or because we think the damages are\n\nconsiderably less.\"    Koster v. Trans World Airlines, 181 F.3d 24,\n\n34 (1st Cir. 1999).    Rather, the defendant must establish that the\n\naward \"is so grossly disproportionate to any injury established by\n\nthe evidence as to be unconscionable as a matter of law.\"          Id.\n\n          The award in this case comprised both economic and\n\nemotional distress damages.     McDonough lost some salary due to the\n\nCity's actions, but acknowledges on appeal that the bulk of the\n\naward was for emotional distress.      McDonough testified that he had\n\nbeen a Quincy police officer for over thirty years and that he\n\n\n                                 -23-\n\f\"loved [his] job.\"    In light of his commitment to his job as a\n\npolice officer, McDonough claimed that the City's actions caused\n\nhim   substantial humiliation and damage to his reputation.    As a\n\nresult of this trauma, McDonough claimed that his relationship with\n\nhis family suffered. He testified that he became easily enraged at\n\nhis grandchildren and was therefore no longer able to see them.   He\n\nalso made his wife and sisters cry and cried himself on occasion.\n\n           McDonough's testimony is similar to the evidence in other\n\ncases where we have sustained comparable emotional distress awards\n\nagainst excessiveness challenges.      In Koster, for example, we\n\nallowed a $250,000 award where the plaintiff testified that the\n\nemployer's conduct caused him to suffer anxiety and insomnia and\n\ndamaged his family life.   Id. at 35-36.   Also in Rodriguez-Torres\n\nv. Caribbean Forms Mfg., Inc., 399 F.3d 52, 64 (1st Cir. 2005), we\n\naffirmed a $250,000 emotional distress award where the plaintiff\n\ntestified that employment discrimination had caused her marriage to\n\nsuffer and had put her into a depression \"for quite some time.\"   In\n\nneither of those cases did the plaintiff seek medical treatment or\n\nhave long-term physical symptoms as a result of the employer's\n\nactions.\n\n           After subtracting the economic damages that McDonough\n\nlikely received, McDonough's emotional distress damages are very\n\nclose to the awards that we permitted to stand in Koster and\n\nRodriguez-Torres.    Given this precedent, the deferential standard\n\nof review, and \"the esoteric nature of damages for emotional\n\n                                -24-\n\fdistress,\" the award in this case, while high, is not so high that\n\nwe should disturb it.7           Koster, 181 F.3d at 36.\n\n                        III.    McDonough's Cross-Appeal\n\n                 In his cross-appeal, McDonough argues that the district\n\ncourt erred by declining to instruct the jury on punitive damages.\n\nWe review de novo the decision to decline a punitive damages\n\ninstruction.        See Che, 342 F.3d at 41.\n\n                 The Supreme Court established the standard for punitive\n\ndamages under Title VII in Kolstad v. American Dental Ass'n, 527\n\nU.S.       526   (1999).       Under   Kolstad,   a   finding   of   intentional\n\ndiscrimination, which is the basis for a compensatory damages\n\naward, does not by itself establish a basis for awarding punitive\n\ndamages.         527 U.S. at 534.      Rather, the plaintiff must make the\n\n\n\n\n       7\n      The City also contends that remittitur is required because\nthe jury's $300,000 award was the maximum amount allowed under\nTitle VII. 42 U.S.C. ยง 1981a(b)(3). According to the City, only\ncases of extreme emotional distress can support an award at or near\nthe Title VII cap. This argument fails as \"nothing in the language\nof the statute suggests that the cap on damages is intended . . .\nto alter the standard of judicial review for [damage] awards.\"\nLuciano v. Olsten Corp., 110 F.3d 210, 221 (2d Cir. 1997). \"The\nstatutory cap is not the limit of a damages spectrum, within which\nthe judge might recalibrate the award given by the jury.\" Deters v.\nEquifax Credit Inform. Servs., Inc., 202 F.3d 1262, 1273 (10th Cir.\n2000); EEOC v. W&O, Inc., 213 F.3d 600, 617 (11th Cir. 2000)\n(same). In any event, McDonough was also awarded these damages\nunder Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, which does not have a damages cap.\nSee LaBonte v. Hutchins & Wheeler, 678 N.E.2d 853, 862 (Mass.\n1997).\n\n                                         -25-\n\fadditional showing that the employer acted with malice or reckless\n\nindifference to federally protected rights.8           Id. at 536.\n\n              The district court was therefore correct to treat the\n\nquestion of whether to instruct on punitive damages as distinct\n\nfrom whether there was sufficient evidence to allow the jury to\n\nfind a Title VII violation.           See Che, 342 F.3d at 41.       But with\n\nthe benefit of hindsight, we part ways with the district court in\n\nits conclusion that no reasonable jury could award punitive damages\n\non the evidence presented.\n\n              The City argues that there was no evidence that its\n\nagents acted with reckless indifference to McDonough's Title VII\n\nrights because it presented legitimate non-retaliatory reasons for\n\nits actions.      This argument fails because the jury found that the\n\nCity       (through   its   agents)    intentionally   retaliated     against\n\nMcDonough and therefore rejected these reasons as the basis for the\n\nCity's actions.       There was proof introduced by McDonough that the\n\ndepartment published an anti-discrimination policy and provided\n\n\n\n       8\n      The plaintiff must also show that there is a basis for\nimputing the bad acts of the employer's agent to the employer. One\nway for the plaintiff to do this is by demonstrating that the agent\nwas acting in a managerial capacity and committed the bad acts\nwithin the scope of his employment. Id. at 542-43. The employer\nmay also avoid punitive damages liability by demonstrating that it\nhas made good-faith efforts to comply with Title VII. Id. at 545-\n46.   The City does not defend the district court's ruling by\narguing either that the City's agents were not managerial employees\nacting within the scope of employment or that it sustained the\ngood-faith compliance defense as a matter of law. See Romano v. U-\nHaul Int'l, 233 F.3d 655, 670 (1st Cir. 2000) (the burden of\ndemonstrating good-faith compliance is on the employer).\n\n                                       -26-\n\fanti-discrimination training for its workforce.      See Rodriguez-\n\nTorres, 399 F.3d at 65 (stating that a punitive damages instruction\n\nwas appropriate where the employer posted signs notifying employees\n\nabout the anti-discrimination laws).9    Moreover, the retaliating\n\nemployees were all high-ranking department officials involved in\n\npersonnel management.   In light of the important role that Title\n\nVII plays in modern personnel management, we cannot conclude on\n\nthis record that a reasonable jury would be compelled to find that\n\nthese officials were unaware that retaliating against an employee\n\nfor assisting with another employee's sexual harassment claim\n\nviolates federal law.   See Powell v. Alexander, 391 F.3d 1, 20 (1st\n\nCir. 2004) (stating that city solicitor, by nature of her position\n\nas an attorney, knew or should have known that retaliating against\n\na public employee for filing a lawsuit is unlawful); DiMarco-Zappa\n\nv. Cabanillas, 238 F.3d 25, 38 (1st Cir. 2001) (stating that \"the\n\nextent of federal statutory and constitutional law preventing\n\ndiscrimination . . . suggests that defendants had to know that such\n\ndiscrimination was illegal\").   The evidence was therefore adequate\n\nfor a rational jury to conclude that the City acted with reckless\n\nindifference to McDonough's Title VII rights.\n\n          As discussed above, malice and reckless indifference\n\nconcern, not the employer's awareness that it is discriminating,\n\n\n     9\n      Conversely, in an appropriate case, an employer might seek to\nadmit this type of evidence on the question of the employer's good\nfaith efforts at compliance, but that issue is not raised in this\nappeal. See supra at n.8.\n\n                                -27-\n\fbut the employer's knowledge that it is acting in violation of\n\nfederal law.         In Kolstad, the Supreme Court provided examples of\n\nsituations in which intentional discrimination does not give rise\n\nto punitive damages.            527 U.S. at 536-37.        Such situations may\n\noccur        where   the   employer      believes   that    it   can   lawfully\n\ndiscriminate,         where the theory of discrimination is novel or\n\npoorly       recognized,   or    where   the    employer   believes    that   its\n\ndiscrimination falls within a statutory exception. Id.; see Farias\n\nv. Instructional Sys., Inc., 259 F.3d 91,                  102 (2d Cir. 2001)\n\n(concluding that no punitive damages instruction was warranted\n\nunder Kolstad in a retaliation case where the employer took the\n\nretaliatory act on advice of counsel that its conduct was lawful).\n\nA jury could conclude that the City's conduct falls into none of\n\nthese categories. Accordingly, the jury should have been permitted\n\nto consider awarding punitive damages for the Title VII violation.10\n\n               This conclusion obliges us to consider the scope of our\n\nremand.        McDonough contends that retrial must be limited to the\n\npunitive damages question.          In support of this argument, he cites\n\n\n\n        10\n      The result is the same under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B.\nPunitive damages are authorized under Massachusetts law where the\nconduct is \"outrageous because of the defendant's evil motive or\nhis reckless indifference to the rights of others.\"       Dartt v.\nBrowning-Ferris Indus., 691 N.E.2d 526, 537 (Mass. 1998). For the\nreasons stated above, the evidence was sufficient for a jury to\nhave concluded that the City acted with \"reckless indifference\" to\nMcDonough's rights under the Massachusetts anti-discrimination\nlaws. See id. (suggesting that punitive damages would have been\nwarranted if there was evidence that employer knowingly violated an\nanti-discrimination law).\n\n                                         -28-\n\fChe, 342 F.3d at 31, where we remanded solely for a retrial on\n\npunitive damages while allowing an emotional distress award to\n\nstand.\n\n             The Fifth Circuit has identified a potential problem in\n\nremanding a case for a trial limited solely to punitive damages\n\nwhere the first jury awarded emotional distress damages.               See\n\nHardin v. Caterpillar, Inc., 227 F.3d 268, 272 (5th Cir. 2000).        As\n\nthe court explained, \"the difficulty inheres in the very nature of\n\na jury's decisionmaking.\" Id. Emotional distress damages are \"the\n\nclassic black box decision\" because the precise sum of emotional\n\ndamages cannot be independently quantified.         Id.    A jury awards\n\nsuch damages based on the degree of emotional harm that it believes\n\nthat the plaintiff endured. But, especially where there is limited\n\nevidence of the plaintiff's physical symptoms, this award is\n\nclosely linked to the jury's view concerning the defendant's\n\nunlawful conduct.      See id.   In other words, the jury's conclusion\n\nabout the plaintiff's level of emotional trauma might well reflect\n\nits   view   concerning   the    reprehensibility   of   the   defendant's\n\nconduct.     See id.   This potential overlap creates a risk that the\n\nplaintiff will recover twice for the reprehensibility of the\n\ndefendant's conduct, if a second jury is allowed to consider only\n\npunitive damages.       See id.; see also Coastal Fuels of P.R. v.\n\nCaribbean Petroleum Co., 79 F.3d 182, 201 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"The law\n\nabhors duplicative recoveries.\").\n\n\n\n                                    -29-\n\f              This is not to say that a serious risk of double recovery\n\nexists in every case.         In Che, for example, the emotional distress\n\naward   was    relatively      low    ($125,000),       given    the   evidence         of\n\nemotional injury.           See 342 F.3d at 36 (the plaintiff suffered\n\nseveral   diagnosed       mental     and    physical    disorders).         In    those\n\ncircumstances, we determined that it was permissible to remand for\n\na retrial limited to punitive damages.              Id. at 34.     But in reaching\n\nthis conclusion, we recognized that this ruling was discretionary\n\nand that an \"appellate court has broad discretion to remand for a\n\nnew trial on all, or only some of the issues in the case.\"                        Id.\n\n              As   Hardin    recognized,      whether    a   retrial      limited   to\n\npunitive damages would be fair must be decided case by case.                        See\n\n227 F.3d at 273.      The emotional distress award in this case, unlike\n\nthe award in Che, was generous in light of the limited evidence\n\nthat McDonough presented.               Some reason for concern therefore\n\nexists, a concern that was absent in Che, that the high award may\n\npartly reflect punishment for what the jury may have concluded was\n\nthe degree of reprehensibility of the City's conduct.                     See Horney\n\nv. Westfield Gage Co., 77 Fed. Appx. 24, 33 (1st Cir. 2003)\n\n(unpublished disposition) (concluding that a retrial limited to\n\npunitive damages may be unfair because the issues of intent,\n\nemotional      distress      damages,      and    punitive      damages    were     \"so\n\nintertwined\").        That said, the district court is in a better\n\nposition to make the judgment call because it viewed McDonough's\n\nevidence of emotional distress first hand.                See id. at 33.         If the\n\n                                           -30-\n\fdistrict court determines that the punitive damages issue should\n\nnot be tried alone, the court should so indicate and provide\n\nMcDonough the opportunity to accept the $300,000 compensatory award\n\nand withdraw his punitive damages claim.   See id.\n\n                          IV. Conclusion\n\n          The district court's ruling denying McDonough's request\n\nfor an instruction on punitive damages is reversed and the case is\n\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.   In\n\nall other respects, the court's rulings are affirmed.    Costs are\n\ntaxed in favor of Appellee/Cross-Appellant John McDonough.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -31-\n\f",

Gen. Laws ch. 151B, by unlawfully retaliating against police officer John McDonough for assisting a fellow officer in pursuing an employment discrimination claim. The jury awarded McDonough $300,000 in compensatory damages. The parties cross-appealed. The City challenges the verdict on several grounds, including that the action was barred by the claim preclusion doctrine and that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict. McDonough challenges the district court's refusal to instruct the jury on awarding punitive damages. We reject the City's appeal but remand for further proceedings concerning punitive damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We present the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict, reserving certain details for the discussion. <i>See Grajales-Romero v. Am. Airlines, Inc.,</i> 194 F.3d 288, 292 (1st Cir.1999). McDonough joined the Quincy Police Department in 1969, subsequently held various ranks and was promoted to lieutenant in 1984. In 1990 he was assigned to command the drug unit, where he has remained since.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1997, McDonough wrote to the then mayor of Quincy, James Sheets, questioning certain decisions made by police department management. In response, Sheets arranged a meeting with McDonough to discuss his grievances. At the meeting, McDonough presented Sheets with a packet of materials highlighting his concerns. One page of the packet included a compilation of allegations that McDonough had heard from other officers about sexual harassment by department employees against police officer Nancy Coletta. Sheets took no action on the Coletta matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late 1999, McDonough learned from other officers that Coletta was planning to file a sexual harassment lawsuit against the City. McDonough did not know Coletta but wanted to help her pursue her claim. He therefore provided Susan Perch, another officer who knew Coletta, with a copy of the page of allegations that he previously had presented to Sheets. This page of allegations was eventually given to Coletta.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 25, 2000, the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination held a hearing on Coletta's claim against the City. Captain William Falco, then administrative assistant to Chief of Police Thomas Frane, attended the hearing at Frane's request. At the hearing, Coletta presented the hearing officer with the page of allegations that McDonough had passed to her and mentioned McDonough's name.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the hearing, Falco reported to Frane about the hearing and indicated that the \"police department . . . or city had some problems\" because of Coletta's suit. Frane instructed Falco to investigate the matter further.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 5th, Falco contacted McDonough to discuss the page of allegations that Coletta had presented at the hearing. McDonough explained that he had given it to Mayor Sheets in 1997 and that, if Falco wanted to obtain a copy, he could contact the mayor's office. Falco unsuccessfully attempted to obtain the page from the mayor's office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The members of the drug unit, including McDonough, worked the night shift and as compensation received fifteen percent higher pay than day-shift employees. Three days after Falco talked to McDonough about the Coletta matter, Frane reassigned McDonough to the day shift. As a result, McDonough lost the pay differential and was essentially stripped of his supervisory duties because the officers he supervised worked on the alternate shift. At the time that McDonough was reassigned, another officer was placed in the drug unit and assumed most of McDonough's supervisory responsibilities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after the reassignment was announced, McDonough, who was on medical leave at that time, called Frane to inquire about the transfer. Frane told him that he had ordered it because McDonough had \"trouble communicating.\" When McDonough objected to this characterization, Frane told him \"in everyone's life a little rain must fall. You can always retire.\" On another occasion, Frane told McDonough that he placed him on the day shift because several city councilors had indicated that they wanted to increase funding for the drug unit and that he wanted McDonough available to answer questions from the councilors. At trial, Frane testified that he had transferred McDonough as part of a department-wide reorganization and because he wanted to better integrate McDonough into the department's management team.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McDonough returned from his medical leave in August 2000 and assumed day-shift duties, where he \"had no one to supervise\" and \"nothing to do.\" He served in this role without significant incident until March 8, 2001, when he signed several \"court slips\" (authorizing extra pay for officers required to attend court proceedings) for officers of the drug unit. McDonough learned the next day that the court slips that he had signed were denied because he no longer was authorized to sign such slips.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McDonough immediately called acting Chief of Police Terrence Kelly (Chief Frane was on a leave of absence after suffering a heart attack; he never returned to his position) to ask why the court slips were denied. Kelly told him that Captain Robert Crowley, McDonough's direct supervisor, had removed McDonough's signing authority. McDonough proceeded to explain that the drug unit was investigating Crowley for potential corruption and that Kelly therefore had to overrule Crowley's order. Kelly refused, and McDonough \"very heatedly screamed at him\" that he would go to the newspapers and city hall if Kelly did not act. McDonough gave Kelly a short deadline to change his position before Kelly hung up the phone. After this conversation, Kelly described to Falco the heated exchange with McDonough and told Falco that he was afraid that McDonough might suffer a heart attack.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> But Kelly took no immediate action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Immediately thereafter, McDonough authored a letter to Kevin Madden, the director of personnel for the department, alerting him to the court-slip incident and other workplace grievances. McDonough stated that he had given relevant documents to another officer to be used in the case of his \"sudden or suspicious death.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Madden received this letter, he met with Kelly and Falco to discuss the situation. It was agreed that McDonough should be placed on paid administrative leave and that his service weapon should be taken pending a fitness-for-duty evaluation by a mental health provider.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the meeting, Kelly and Falco summoned McDonough to Kelly's office to inform him that he was being placed on administrative leave. They then took his firearm and told him that he had to leave the police headquarters immediately and could not return unless and until he passed a mental health evaluation. After McDonough was placed on leave, no one from the department checked to make sure that McDonough had no other weapons in his possession, contacted McDonough's family to alert them to the concerns about his mental health, or arranged to ensure that McDonough made it home safely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McDonough subsequently met with a psychiatrist who concluded that McDonough was fit to return to his post. McDonough returned to his day-shift position in May 2001 and several weeks later was returned to the night shift by Falco, who in the interim had been appointed chief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 2001, McDonough filed this action claiming that the City had retaliated against him by, <i>inter alia,</i> transferring him to the day shift and placing him on administrative leave. After a five-day trial, the court submitted the case to the jury but declined to allow the jury to consider awarding punitive damages. The jury returned a general verdict for McDonough and awarded him $300,000 in lost wages and emotional distress damages. The City moved for judgment as a matter of law on the ground that McDonough had not presented sufficient evidence to ground the jury's retaliation finding and, alternatively, moved to have the damage award remitted. The district court denied the motion and entered judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. The City's Appeal</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Claim Preclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The City asserts that McDonough's action should have been dismissed as it was barred under the claim preclusion doctrine as a result of an unsuccessful Massachusetts state court action that McDonough filed against the City in 1999. In 1998, McDonough was passed over for promotion to police captain and subsequently sued the City in Massachusetts Superior Court, claiming that he had been denied the promotion in retaliation for his complaint to Sheets in 1997. The case went to trial in 2003, and a state court judge entered judgment for the City at the close of McDonough's case-in-chief. The City argues that the state and federal actions are identical and that the federal action is therefore barred. It bases this argument on a foundational assertion that both cases center on the page of Coletta allegations that McDonough first presented to Sheets at their 1997 meeting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected this argument on the ground that the federal and state actions are distinct. The court viewed the state action as based primarily on the alleged retaliatory conduct by Sheets after the 1997 meeting, while the federal action is based primarily on retaliation perpetrated by members of the department after McDonough helped Coletta in 1999. We review this determination de novo. <i>See Maher v. GSI Lumonics, Inc.,</i> 433 F.3d 123, 126 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Under federal law, a federal court must give to a state-court judgment the same preclusive effect as would be given that judgment under the law of the state in which that judgment was entered.\" <i>Torromeo v. Fremont,</i> 438 F.3d 113, 115 (1st Cir.2006) (internal citations omitted). Thus, the effect the Massachusetts court's final judgment has on McDonough's federal action is determined by applying the Massachusetts law of claim preclusion. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claim preclusion doctrine in Massachusetts \"prohibits the maintenance of an action based on the same claim that was the subject of an earlier action between the same parties or their privies.\" <i>Bagley v. Moxley,</i> 407 Mass. 633, 555 N.E.2d 229, 231 (1990). \"[C]laim preclusion makes a valid final judgment conclusive on the parties or privies, and bars further litigation of all matters that were or should have been adjudicated in the action.\" <i>Id.</i> \"There are three essential elements to the doctrine of claim preclusion: (1) the identity or privity of the parties to the present and prior actions; (2) identity of the cause[s] of action; and (3) a prior final judgment on the merits.\" <i>Bui v. Ma,</i> 62 Mass.App.Ct. 553, 818 N.E.2d 572, 579 (2004). Causes of action are identical if they \"derive[] from the same transaction or series of connected transactions.\" <i>TLT Const. Corp. v. A. Anthony Tappe,</i> 48 Mass.App.Ct. 1, 716 N.E.2d 1044, 1052 (1999). \"What factual grouping constitutes a transaction is to be determined pragmatically, giving weight to such factors as whether the facts are related in time, space and origin or motivation, whether they form a convenient trial unit, and whether their treatment as a unit conforms to the parties' expectations.\" <i>Mancuso v. Kinchla,</i> 60 Mass.App.Ct. 558, 806 N.E.2d 427, 438 (2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no question that the parties to the state and federal actions are the same and that the state action resulted in a final judgment on the merits adverse to McDonough. Thus, the only issue is whether the causes of action share sufficient identity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court that they do not. The transaction on which the state action was based was McDonough's failure to be appointed captain in 1998, which he attributed to retaliation orchestrated by Sheets for exercising his First Amendment rights in 1997. The transactions on which the federal suit is based were McDonough's transfer and his placement on administrative leave, which he claims were ordered by members of the department after they learned in 2000 that he had assisted Coletta in her lawsuit. McDonough's suits against the City were premised on separate acts of protected conduct that occurred years apart. Moreover, the allegedly retaliatory actions were ordered by different City agents over a several year period. These differences support the district court's ruling that the federal action is not barred. <i>See, e.g., Gonzalez-Pina v. Rodriguez,</i> 407 F.3d 425, 430 (1st Cir.2005) (concluding, in an employment discrimination case, that \"subsequent conduct, even if it is of the same nature as the conduct complained of in a prior lawsuit, may give rise to an entirely separate cause of action\"); <i>Herrmann v. Cencom Cable Assocs. Inc.,</i> 999 F.2d 223, 226 (7th Cir.1993) (Posner, J.) (concluding that claim preclusion did not bar two tangentially related employment claims because the essential facts underlying the claims were distinct); <i>Manning v. City of Auburn,</i> 953 F.2d 1355, 1359 (11th Cir. 1992) (ruling that claim preclusion did not bar a second employment discrimination claim, where the facts underlying the second suit had not occurred when the first suit was filed).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The page of allegations that McDonough gave to Sheets was, of course, relevant evidence in each case. But the district court correctly recognized that this is too tenuous a connection to warrant a finding of claim preclusion and to deprive McDonough of his day in court. <i>See Herrmann,</i> 999 F.2d at 226 (refusing to find claim preclusion when the claims had only limited shared facts); <i>see also Andersen v. Chrysler Corp.,</i> 99 F.3d 846, 853 (7th Cir. 1996) (cautioning that a claim preclusion analysis should not proceed at too high a level of generality because of the risk of unfairly precluding a litigant from having her day in court).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The City argues that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because McDonough failed to present sufficient evidence to warrant the jury's retaliation finding. It claims that the evidence demonstrates, at most, that the actions taken against McDonough \"were based on personal conflicts with [City] officials,\" and that such evidence is inadequate to sustain a retaliation verdict. The district court rejected this argument, concluding that there was sufficient proof from which a jury could infer that the City's actions against McDonough were motivated by retaliatory animus stemming from his assisting Coletta.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review de novo the denial of the City's motion for judgment as a matter of law, <i>see Marrero v. Goya of P.R.,</i> 304 F.3d 7, 14 (1st Cir.2002), and we examine the evidence presented at trial in the light most favorable to McDonough. <i>See White v. N.H. Dep't of Corr.,</i> 221 F.3d 254, 259 (1st Cir.2000). We \"may not consider the credibility of witnesses, resolve conflicts in testimony or evaluate the weight of the evidence.\" <i>Katz v. City Metal Co.,</i> 87 F.3d 26, 28 (1st Cir.1996). Our review \"is weighted toward preservation of the jury's verdict, for we must affirm unless the evidence was so strongly and overwhelmingly inconsistent with the verdict[] that no reasonable jury could have returned [it].\" <i>Crowley v. L.L. Bean, Inc.,</i> 303 F.3d 387, 393 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury was instructed to consider McDonough's claim under the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> burden-shifting framework. <i>See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</i> 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). Under <i>McDonnell Douglas,</i> the plaintiff must make a prima facie showing that (i) he engaged in protected conduct, (ii) he was thereafter subject to an adverse employment action, and (iii) a causal connection exists between the protected conduct and the adverse action. <i>See Ramirez Rodriguez v. Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,</i> 425 F.3d 67, 84 (1st Cir.2005). If the plaintiff makes this showing, the burden of production shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its employment decision. <i>See id.</i> Finally, if the defendant presents such a reason, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant's proffered reason is pretext masking illegal retaliation. <i>See id.</i> Evidence that the defendant's reason was pretext may, but need not, ground a finding of liability. <i>Fite v. Digital Equip. Corp.,</i> 232 F.3d 3, 7 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The City has not presented in its main brief a developed argument that McDonough failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation. It focuses instead on the evidence that McDonough presented to undermine the City's asserted reasons for taking the challenged employment actions. As discussed above, the jury was presented with two adverse employment actions: McDonough's reassignment to the day shift and his placement on administrative leave. We consider whether McDonough presented sufficient evidence of pretext such that the jury could conclude that retaliation was the real motive for each of the challenged actions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chief Frane ordered McDonough's transfer to the day shift within days of learning that McDonough had assisted Coletta in pursuing her sex discrimination claim. At trial, the City claimed that Frane's decision to transfer McDonough was part of a department-wide reorganization and that the timing was coincidental.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is \"no mechanical formula\" for determining pretext, <i>Che v. Mass. Bay Transp. Auth.,</i> 342 F.3d 31, 39 (1st Cir. 2003) (internal citation omitted), and we have recognized that pretext can be proven in many ways, <i>see Santiago-Ramos v. Centennial P.R. Wireless Corp.,</i> 217 F.3d 46, 55 (1st Cir.2000). One way is for the plaintiff to show that the employer gave \"different and arguably inconsistent explanations\" for taking the adverse employment action. <i>Dominguez-Cruz v. Suttle Caribe, Inc.,</i> 202 F.3d 424, 432 (1st Cir. 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, there was evidence that Frane provided several, arguably inconsistent, explanations for transferring McDonough. When McDonough first confronted Frane about the transfer, Frane told him that it was because he had \"trouble communicating\" and that, if he did not like it, he \"could retire.\" Several months later, when McDonough again asked Frane why he had been transferred, Frane stated that \"some city councilors wanted to put additional funding into the drug unit,\" and that the transfer was intended to help secure this funding. At trial, Frane testified that the transfer was part of a \"major transformation\" of the department and that it was designed to integrate McDonough into the department's management team. These shifting explanations provided a basis for the jury to conclude that the reason the City presented at trial was false.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, there was testimony from two police captains, who attended management meetings with Chief Frane just before the transfer, that there was no discussion of restructuring the drug unit. The jury could have concluded that this evidence was inconsistent with the City's contention that the transfer decision was a part of a systemic restructuring process. <i>See Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc.,</i> 530 U.S. 133, 143, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000) (stating that a jury can find pretext where \"the employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There also was evidence from which the jury could have found pretext masking retaliation in the City's claim that it placed McDonough on administrative leave because it perceived him to be a safety risk. Acting Chief Kelly, the person who decided to place McDonough on leave, testified that it was common knowledge that McDonough often became highly emotional but that he would quickly calm down. This testimony was given during Kelly's account of his conversation with McDonough that led him to be primarily concerned that McDonough might have a heart attack. Kelly admitted that he did not perceive McDonough to be a safety threat when this conversation occurred. Moreover, no one in the department investigated McDonough's letter to Madden to determine the basis and motivation for his statements. From this evidence, the jury could infer that Kelly, Madden, and Falco used McDonough's phone call and letter to establish a pretextual safety rationale for the decision to put McDonough on administrative leave.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, a jury could view the actions that Kelly and Falco took when they informed McDonough that he was being placed on leave as tending to undermine the asserted safety rationale. Falco testified that he was so concerned about the possibility of McDonough becoming violent that he wore a bullet-proof vest to the meeting at which Kelly informed McDonough of the decision to place him on leave. But Kelly did not take any such precautions for himself or his secretary who was sitting directly outside of the door to the office in which the meeting was held. Nor did Kelly or Falco arrange to have an officer on alert in case the meeting turned violent. And, after the meeting, no one at the department checked to see if McDonough had other weapons in his possession, alerted McDonough's family that he was a potential danger to himself or others, or arranged to ensure that McDonough traveled home safely. Indeed, the next contact between the department and McDonough did not occur until several days later, when someone from the department called to provide him with the details of his fitness-for-duty evaluation. Though the inference is not inevitable, the jury reasonably could have concluded that this is not how experienced police officers would have handled placing an officer on leave if they truly believed that he posed a safety risk. <i>See Hodgens v. Gen. Dynamics Corp.,</i> 144 F.3d 151, 167 (1st Cir.1998) (stating that pretext may be proven by showing \"weaknesses, implausibilities, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In assessing pretext, \"everything depends on the individual facts.\" <i>Thomas v. Eastman Kodak Co.,</i> 183 F.3d 38, 57 (1st Cir.1999). As such, we are \"particularly cautious\" about setting aside a jury's determinations that an employer's proffered explanation was pretext. <i>Hodgens,</i> 144 F.3d at 167. \"Determinations of motive and intent, particularly in discrimination cases, are questions better suited for the jury.\" <i>Mulero-Rodriguez v. Ponte,</i> 98 F.3d 670, 677 (1st Cir.1996). While the jury could have accepted the City's explanations for its actions, we cannot say that it was irrational for the jury to have concluded that the explanations were pretextual and that retaliation was the motivation for the City's actions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Trial-Error Claims</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Evidentiary Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The City challenges several evidentiary rulings. We review these claims for an abuse of discretion. <i>See Ramirez v. Debs-Elias,</i> 407 F.3d 444, 449 (1st Cir. 2005). Erroneous evidentiary rulings are harmless if it is highly probable that the error did not affect the outcome of the case. <i>See Rodriguez-Hernandez v. Miranda-Velez,</i> 132 F.3d 848, 855 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The City's first claim is that the district court abused its discretion by declining to allow it to introduce evidence that McDonough had lost his previous lawsuit against the City.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>See supra</i> at ___. The City argues that this evidence was relevant because it showed that McDonough was litigious and had a history of bringing meritless lawsuits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the \"charge of litigiousness is a serious one, likely to result in undue prejudice against the party charged[,]\" <i>Outley v. City of New York,</i> 837 F.2d 587, 592 (2d Cir.1988), ordinarily proof that the plaintiff filed prior similar lawsuits is admissible to show the plaintiff's litigiousness only if there is also evidence that the prior lawsuits were fraudulently filed, <i>see McCormick on Evidence,</i> &#167; 196 at 691 (5th ed.1999). Here, there is evidence that McDonough filed one prior lawsuit against the City after he was denied a promotion. But, while that lawsuit was unsuccessful, there is nothing suggesting that it was fraudulently filed. <i>See Mathis v. Phillips Chevrolet, Inc.,</i> 269 F.3d 771, 776-77 (7th Cir.2001) (concluding that there was no abuse of discretion in declining to admit evidence of prior lawsuits where the evidence was in dispute whether the prior suits were fraudulently brought or merely unsuccessful). The district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding evidence about the result of McDonough's prior lawsuit against the City.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The City next contends that the district court improperly precluded it from questioning McDonough about his contentious relationship with the mayor and the police department. We disagree with the City's characterization of the district court's ruling. The City was permitted to ask McDonough about his strained relationships with certain department officials, to introduce the fact that McDonough had sued the City on a prior occasion, and to present documents highlighting various points of dispute between McDonough and the department. The ruling in question involved the court telling the City to \"move on\" after counsel had asked McDonough several repetitive questions about his relationship with Captain Falco.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Fed.R.Evid. 403, the district court retains discretion to \"prevent the needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\" <i>Donovan v. Burger King Corp.,</i> 672 F.2d 221, 225 (1st Cir.1982). The court provided the City with ample opportunity to highlight McDonough's sour relationship with the City. It was within the court's discretion to draw the line where it did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The City's third evidentiary argument is that the district court abused its discretion by permitting McDonough to present a chalk to the jury stating that Coletta had settled her lawsuit for $500,000. Even if this information should not have been presented to the jury, the City did not timely object to the chalk, and the court <i>sua sponte</i> explained that the jury should not infer anything from the amount of the Coletta settlement. \"We have held, [that] the potential for prejudice... [often] can be satisfactorily dispelled by appropriate curative instructions,\" as \"[j]urors are presumed to follow such instructions, except in extreme cases.\" <i>United States v. Richardson,</i> 421 F.3d 17, 41 (1st Cir.2005). Given the tangential relevance of the Coletta settlement and the court's timely limiting instruction, we are confident that the verdict was not swayed by the chalk.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally the City argues the district court wrongly admitted out-of-court statements by Falco and Madden concerning the decision to place McDonough on administrative leave. The City contends that these statements were hearsay and could not be received as admissions under Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(D) because the declarants were not \"policymakers,\" (which the City would limit in this case to the chief of police and the mayor).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For a statement to be an admission under Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(D), it must be made by a party, a party's agent, or a servant within the scope of an agency or employment. <i>See Gomez v. Rivera Rodriguez,</i> 344 F.3d 103, 116 (1st Cir. 2003). The employee's station within the organization is not relevant to the Rule 801(d)(2) analysis. <i>See Woodman v. Haemonetics Corp.,</i> 51 F.3d 1087, 1093-94 (1st Cir.1995) (rejecting argument that statements by \"first-line supervisor\" with no firing authority could not be admissions under Rule 801(d)(2)(D)). The relevant inquiry is whether the employee's statement was made within the scope of employment. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, there is no question that Falco and Madden made the challenged statements within the scope of their employment. Both were department officials involved in personnel management, and the statements related to a possible personnel action against McDonough. <i>See id.</i> (concluding that statement by employee involved in the plaintiff's termination was admissible under Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(D)). The statements were properly admitted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Jury Instruction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to challenging the transfer and leave decisions, McDonough presented evidence that he was subject to adverse employment actions by being denied the use of a department car, by not having his supervisory responsibility restored after he was returned to the night shift, and by being denied the authority to sign court slips. After the close of the evidence, the district court directed a verdict for the City on these claims and only permitted the jury to consider the transfer and leave allegations. The City contends that the district court's charge did not adequately explain that McDonough's claim was limited to those allegations. We review this claim for abuse of discretion. <i>See Sanchez-Lopez v. Fuentes-Pujols,</i> 375 F.3d 121, 133 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's instructions were more than adequate to explain the nature of McDonough's claims. The court explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]his case [is] grounded in two incidents. One, the transfer of Mr. McDonough... from nights to days ... and later on a determination that he was to surrender his firearms and stay on administrative leave until he went to a psychiatrist and was certified for duty in that period of time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later, the court instructed that \"this case is about\" McDonough being \"taken from nights and placed on days\" and being placed on \"administrative leave.\" The instructions were more than sufficient to apprise the jury of the actionable theories.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Damages</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The City argues that the district court erred by declining to reduce McDonough's $300,000 damages award because the award was \"grossly excessive\" and \"shocking to the conscience.\" We review the district court's denial of remittitur for an abuse of discretion. <i>See Gasperini v. Ctr. for Humanities, Inc.,</i> 518 U.S. 415, 433, 116 S.Ct. 2211, 135 L.Ed.2d 659 (1996). \"We will not disturb an award of damages because it is extremely generous or because we think the damages are considerably less.\" <i>Koster v. Trans World Airlines,</i> 181 F.3d 24, 34 (1st Cir.1999). Rather, the defendant must establish that the award \"is so grossly disproportionate to any injury established by the evidence as to be unconscionable as a matter of law.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The award in this case comprised both economic and emotional distress damages. McDonough lost some salary due to the City's actions, but acknowledges on appeal that the bulk of the award was for emotional distress. McDonough testified that he had been a Quincy police officer for over thirty years and that he \"loved [his] job.\" In light of his commitment to his job as a police officer, McDonough claimed that the City's actions caused him substantial humiliation and damage to his reputation. As a result of this trauma, McDonough claimed that his relationship with his family suffered. He testified that he became easily enraged at his grandchildren and was therefore no longer able to see them. He also made his wife and sisters cry and cried himself on occasion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McDonough's testimony is similar to the evidence in other cases where we have sustained comparable emotional distress awards against excessiveness challenges. In <i>Koster,</i> for example, we allowed a $250,000 award where the plaintiff testified that the employer's conduct caused him to suffer anxiety and insomnia and damaged his family life. <i>Id.</i> at 35-36. Also in <i>Rodriguez-Torres v. Caribbean Forms Mfg., Inc.,</i> 399 F.3d 52, 64 (1st Cir.2005), we affirmed a $250,000 emotional distress award where the plaintiff testified that employment discrimination had caused her marriage to suffer and had put her into a depression \"for quite some time.\" In neither of those cases did the plaintiff seek medical treatment or have long-term physical symptoms as a result of the employer's actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After subtracting the economic damages that McDonough likely received, McDonough's emotional distress damages are very close to the awards that we permitted to stand in <i>Koster</i> and <i>Rodriguez-Torres.</i> Given this precedent, the deferential standard of review, and \"the esoteric nature of damages for emotional distress,\" the award in this case, while high, is not so high that we should disturb it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> <i>Koster,</i> 181 F.3d at 36.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. McDonough's Cross-Appeal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his cross-appeal, McDonough argues that the district court erred by declining to instruct the jury on punitive damages. We review de novo the decision to decline a punitive damages instruction. <i>See Che,</i> 342 F.3d at 41.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court established the standard for punitive damages under Title VII in <i>Kolstad v. American Dental Ass'n,</i> 527 U.S. 526, 119 S.Ct. 2118, 144 L.Ed.2d 494 (1999). Under <i>Kolstad,</i> a finding of intentional discrimination, which is the basis for a compensatory damages award, does not by itself establish a basis for awarding punitive damages. 527 U.S. at 534, 119 S.Ct. 2118. Rather, the plaintiff must make the additional showing that the employer acted with malice or reckless indifference to federally protected rights.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> <i>Id.</i> at 536, 119 S.Ct. 2118.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court was therefore correct to treat the question of whether to instruct on punitive damages as distinct from whether there was sufficient evidence to allow the jury to find a Title VII violation. <i>See Che,</i> 342 F.3d at 41. But with the benefit of hindsight, we part ways with the district court in its conclusion that no reasonable jury could award punitive damages on the evidence presented.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The City argues that there was no evidence that its agents acted with reckless indifference to McDonough's Title VII rights because it presented legitimate non-retaliatory reasons for its actions. This argument fails because the jury found that the City (through its agents) intentionally retaliated against McDonough and therefore rejected these reasons as the basis for the City's actions. There was proof introduced by McDonough that the department published an anti-discrimination policy and provided anti-discrimination training for its workforce. <i>See Rodriguez-Torres,</i> 399 F.3d at 65 (stating that a punitive damages instruction was appropriate where the employer posted signs notifying employees about the anti-discrimination laws).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Moreover, the retaliating employees were all high-ranking department officials involved in personnel management. In light of the important role that Title VII plays in modern personnel management, we cannot conclude on this record that a reasonable jury would be compelled to find that these officials were unaware that retaliating against an employee for assisting with another employee's sexual harassment claim violates federal law. <i>See Powell v. Alexander,</i> 391 F.3d 1, 20 (1st Cir.2004) (stating that city solicitor, by nature of her position as an attorney, knew or should have known that retaliating against a public employee for filing a lawsuit is unlawful); <i>DiMarco-Zappa v. Cabanillas,</i> 238 F.3d 25, 38 (1st Cir.2001) (stating that \"the extent of federal statutory and constitutional law preventing discrimination ... suggests that defendants had to know that such discrimination was illegal\"). The evidence was therefore adequate for a rational jury to conclude that the City acted with reckless indifference to McDonough's Title VII rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As discussed above, malice and reckless indifference concern, not the employer's awareness that it is discriminating, but the employer's knowledge that it is acting in violation of federal law. In <i>Kolstad,</i> the Supreme Court provided examples of situations in which intentional discrimination does not give rise to punitive damages. 527 U.S. at 536-37, 119 S.Ct. 2118. Such situations may occur where the employer believes that it can lawfully discriminate, where the theory of discrimination is novel or poorly recognized, or where the employer believes that its discrimination falls within a statutory exception. <i>Id.; see Farias v. Instructional Sys., Inc.,</i> 259 F.3d 91, 102 (2d Cir.2001) (concluding that no punitive damages instruction was warranted under <i>Kolstad</i> in a retaliation case where the employer took the retaliatory act on advice of counsel that its conduct was lawful). A jury could conclude that the City's conduct falls into none of these categories. Accordingly, the jury should have been permitted to consider awarding punitive damages for the Title VII violation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion obliges us to consider the scope of our remand. McDonough contends that retrial must be limited to the punitive damages question. In support of this argument, he cites <i>Che,</i> 342 F.3d at 31, where we remanded solely for a retrial on punitive damages while allowing an emotional distress award to stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fifth Circuit has identified a potential problem in remanding a case for a trial limited solely to punitive damages where the first jury awarded emotional distress damages. <i>See Hardin v. Caterpillar, Inc.,</i> 227 F.3d 268, 272 (5th Cir.2000). As the court explained, \"the difficulty inheres in the very nature of a jury's decisionmaking.\" <i>Id.</i> Emotional distress damages are \"the classic black box decision\" because the precise sum of emotional damages cannot be independently quantified. <i>Id.</i> A jury awards such damages based on the degree of emotional harm that it believes that the plaintiff endured. But, especially where there is limited evidence of the plaintiff's physical symptoms, this award is closely linked to the jury's view concerning the defendant's unlawful conduct. <i>See id.</i> In other words, the jury's conclusion about the plaintiff's level of emotional trauma might well reflect its view concerning the reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct. <i>See id.</i> This potential overlap creates a risk that the plaintiff will recover twice for the reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct, if a second jury is allowed to consider only punitive damages. <i>See id.; see also Coastal Fuels of P.R. v. Caribbean Petroleum Co.,</i> 79 F.3d 182, 201 (1st Cir.1996) (\"The law abhors duplicative recoveries.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not to say that a serious risk of double recovery exists in every case. In <i>Che,</i> for example, the emotional distress award was relatively low ($125,000), given the evidence of emotional injury. <i>See</i> 342 F.3d at 36 (the plaintiff suffered several diagnosed mental and physical disorders). In those circumstances, we determined that it was permissible to remand for a retrial limited to punitive damages. <i>Id.</i> at 34. But in reaching this conclusion, we recognized that this ruling was discretionary and that an \"appellate court has broad discretion to remand for a new trial on all, or only some of the issues in the case.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As <i>Hardin</i> recognized, whether a retrial limited to punitive damages would be fair must be decided case by case. <i>See</i> 227 F.3d at 273. The emotional distress award in this case, unlike the award in <i>Che,</i> was generous in light of the limited evidence that McDonough presented. Some reason for concern therefore exists, a concern that was absent in <i>Che,</i> that the high award may partly reflect punishment for what the jury may have concluded was the degree of reprehensibility of the City's conduct. <i>See Horney v. Westfield Gage Co.,</i> 77 Fed.Appx. 24, 33 (1st Cir.2003) (unpublished disposition) (concluding that a retrial limited to punitive damages may be unfair because the issues of intent, emotional distress damages, and punitive damages were \"so intertwined\"). That said, the district court is in a better position to make the judgment call because it viewed McDonough's evidence of emotional distress first hand. <i>See id.</i> at 33. If the district court determines that the punitive damages issue should not be tried alone, the court should so indicate and provide McDonough the opportunity to accept the $300,000 compensatory award and withdraw his punitive damages claim. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's ruling denying McDonough's request for an instruction on punitive damages is <i>reversed</i> and the case is <i>remanded</i> for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. In all other respects, the court's rulings are <i>affirmed.</i> Costs are taxed in favor of Appellee/Cross-Appellant John McDonough.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> It was well-known in the department that McDonough had a heart condition</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In addition, the causes of action do not present a convenient trial unit. The key witnesses for the state action were Sheets and McDonough, while the federal action required several department witnesses and substantial documentary evidence about police department procedure and policies<i>See Catullo v. Metzner,</i> 834 F.2d 1075, 1078 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The City does not argue that these actions were insufficient to establish a retaliation claim on the basis that they were not severe enough \"to dissuade a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\"<i>Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Railway v. White,</i> 548 U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 2407, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2006).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> We also reject the City's contention that we should order a new trial. As discussed above, the evidence was adequate for the jury to find retaliation<i>See Marrero,</i> 304 F.3d at 14 (stating that a new trial should only be ordered if \"the outcome is against the clear weight of the evidence such that upholding the verdict will result in a miscarriage of justice\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The court did allow the City to introduce the fact that there was a prior lawsuit between McDonough and the City</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The City also challenges the propriety of McDonough's closing argument. It did not, however, object below, and therefore we review for plain error<i>See Santos v. Sunrise Med.,</i> 351 F.3d 587, 592-593 (1st Cir.2003). There was no such error, for there is no reason to think that any of the challenged statements came close to causing the City substantial prejudice. <i>See Smith v. Kmart Corp.,</i> 177 F.3d 19, 25-26 (1st Cir.1999) (describing plain error as \"a rare species in civil litigation\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The City also contends that remittitur is required because the jury's $300,000 award was the maximum amount allowed under Title VII. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981a(b)(3). According to the City, only cases of extreme emotional distress can support an award at or near the Title VII cap. This argument fails as \"nothing in the language of the statute suggests that the cap on damages is intended ... to alter the standard of judicial review for [damage] awards.\"<i>Luciano v. Olsten Corp.,</i> 110 F.3d 210, 221 (2d Cir.1997). \"The statutory cap is not the limit of a damages spectrum, within which the judge might recalibrate the award given by the jury.\" <i>Deters v. Equifax Credit Inform. Servs., Inc.,</i> 202 F.3d 1262, 1273 (10th Cir.2000); <i>EEOC v. W &amp; O, Inc.,</i> 213 F.3d 600, 617 (11th Cir.2000) (same). In any event, McDonough was also awarded these damages under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, which does not have a damages cap. <i>See Labonte v. Hutchins &amp; Wheeler,</i> 424 Mass. 813, 678 N.E.2d 853, 862 (1997).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The plaintiff must also show that there is a basis for imputing the bad acts of the employer's agent to the employer. One way for the plaintiff to do this is by demonstrating that the agent was acting in a managerial capacity and committed the bad acts within the scope of his employment<i>Id.</i> at 542-43, 119 S.Ct. 2118. The employer may also avoid punitive damages liability by demonstrating that it has made good-faith efforts to comply with Title VII. <i>Id.</i> at 545-463, 119 S.Ct. 2118. The City does not defend the district court's ruling by arguing either that the City's agents were not managerial employees acting within the scope of employment or that it sustained the good-faith compliance defense as a matter of law. <i>See Romano v. U-Haul Int'l,</i> 233 F.3d 655, 670 (1st Cir.2000) (the burden of demonstrating good-faith compliance is on the employer).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Conversely, in an appropriate case, an employer might seek to admit this type of evidence on the question of the employer's good faith efforts at compliance, but that issue is not raised in this appeal<i>See supra</i> at n. 8.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> The result is the same under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B. Punitive damages are authorized under Massachusetts law where the conduct is \"outrageous because of the defendant's evil motive or his reckless indifference to the rights of others.\"<i>Dartt v. Browning-Ferris Indus.,</i> 427 Mass. 1, 691 N.E.2d 526, 537 (1998). For the reasons stated above, the evidence was sufficient for a jury to have concluded that the City acted with \"reckless indifference\" to McDonough's rights under the Massachusetts anti-discrimination laws. <i>See id.</i> (suggesting that punitive damages would have been warranted if there was evidence that employer knowingly violated an anti-discrimination law).</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Gen. Laws ch. 151B, by unlawfully retaliating against police officer John McDonough for assisting a fellow officer in pursuing an employment discrimination claim. The jury awarded McDonough $300,000 in compensatory damages. The parties cross-appealed. The City challenges the verdict on several grounds, including that the action was barred by the claim preclusion doctrine and that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict. McDonough challenges the district court's refusal to instruct the jury on awarding punitive damages. We reject the City's appeal but remand for further proceedings concerning punitive damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We present the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict, reserving certain details for the discussion. <i>See Grajales-Romero v. Am. Airlines, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198693\"><a href=\"/opinion/198693/grajales-romero-v-american-airlines/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">288</span></a></span>, 292 (1st Cir.1999). McDonough joined the Quincy Police Department in 1969, subsequently held various ranks and was promoted to lieutenant in 1984. In 1990 he was assigned to command the drug unit, where he has remained since.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1997, McDonough wrote to the then mayor of Quincy, James Sheets, questioning certain decisions made by police department management. In response, Sheets arranged a meeting with McDonough to discuss his grievances. At the meeting, McDonough presented Sheets with a packet of materials highlighting his concerns. One page of the packet included a compilation of allegations that McDonough had heard from other officers about sexual harassment by department employees against police officer Nancy Coletta. Sheets took no action on the Coletta matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late 1999, McDonough learned from other officers that Coletta was planning to file a sexual harassment lawsuit against the City. McDonough did not know Coletta but wanted to help her pursue her claim. He therefore provided Susan Perch, another officer who knew Coletta, with a copy of the page of allegations that he previously had presented to Sheets. This page of allegations was eventually given to Coletta.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 25, 2000, the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination held a hearing on Coletta's claim against the City. Captain William Falco, then administrative assistant to Chief of Police Thomas Frane, attended the hearing at Frane's request. At the hearing, Coletta presented the hearing officer with the page of allegations that McDonough had passed to her and mentioned McDonough's name.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the hearing, Falco reported to Frane about the hearing and indicated that the \"police department . . . or city had some problems\" because of Coletta's suit. Frane instructed Falco to investigate the matter further.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 5th, Falco contacted McDonough to discuss the page of allegations that Coletta had presented at the hearing. McDonough explained that he had given it to Mayor Sheets in 1997 and that, if Falco wanted to obtain a copy, he could contact the mayor's office. Falco unsuccessfully attempted to obtain the page from the mayor's office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The members of the drug unit, including McDonough, worked the night shift and as compensation received fifteen percent higher pay than day-shift employees. Three days after Falco talked to McDonough about the Coletta matter, Frane reassigned McDonough to the day shift. As a result, McDonough lost the pay differential and was essentially stripped of his supervisory duties because the officers he supervised worked on the alternate shift. At the time that McDonough was reassigned, another officer was placed in the drug unit and assumed most of McDonough's supervisory responsibilities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after the reassignment was announced, McDonough, who was on medical leave at that time, called Frane to inquire about the transfer. Frane told him that he had ordered it because McDonough had \"trouble communicating.\" When McDonough objected to this characterization, Frane told him \"in everyone's life a little rain must fall. You can always retire.\" On another occasion, Frane told McDonough that he placed him on the day shift because several city councilors had indicated that they wanted to increase funding for the drug unit and that he wanted McDonough available to answer questions from the councilors. At trial, Frane testified that he had transferred McDonough as part of a department-wide reorganization and because he wanted to better integrate McDonough into the department's management team.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McDonough returned from his medical leave in August 2000 and assumed day-shift duties, where he \"had no one to supervise\" and \"nothing to do.\" He served in this role without significant incident until March 8, 2001, when he signed several \"court slips\" (authorizing extra pay for officers required to attend court proceedings) for officers of the drug unit. McDonough learned the next day that the court slips that he had signed were denied because he no longer was authorized to sign such slips.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McDonough immediately called acting Chief of Police Terrence Kelly (Chief Frane was on a leave of absence after suffering a heart attack; he never returned to his position) to ask why the court slips were denied. Kelly told him that Captain Robert Crowley, McDonough's direct supervisor, had removed McDonough's signing authority. McDonough proceeded to explain that the drug unit was investigating Crowley for potential corruption and that Kelly therefore had to overrule Crowley's order. Kelly refused, and McDonough \"very heatedly screamed at him\" that he would go to the newspapers and city hall if Kelly did not act. McDonough gave Kelly a short deadline to change his position before Kelly hung up the phone. After this conversation, Kelly described to Falco the heated exchange with McDonough and told Falco that he was afraid that McDonough might suffer a heart attack.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> But Kelly took no immediate action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Immediately thereafter, McDonough authored a letter to Kevin Madden, the director of personnel for the department, alerting him to the court-slip incident and other workplace grievances. McDonough stated that he had given relevant documents to another officer to be used in the case of his \"sudden or suspicious death.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Madden received this letter, he met with Kelly and Falco to discuss the situation. It was agreed that McDonough should be placed on paid administrative leave and that his service weapon should be taken pending a fitness-for-duty evaluation by a mental health provider.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the meeting, Kelly and Falco summoned McDonough to Kelly's office to inform him that he was being placed on administrative leave. They then took his firearm and told him that he had to leave the police headquarters immediately and could not return unless and until he passed a mental health evaluation. After McDonough was placed on leave, no one from the department checked to make sure that McDonough had no other weapons in his possession, contacted McDonough's family to alert them to the concerns about his mental health, or arranged to ensure that McDonough made it home safely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McDonough subsequently met with a psychiatrist who concluded that McDonough was fit to return to his post. McDonough returned to his day-shift position in May 2001 and several weeks later was returned to the night shift by Falco, who in the interim had been appointed chief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 2001, McDonough filed this action claiming that the City had retaliated against him by, <i>inter alia,</i> transferring him to the day shift and placing him on administrative leave. After a five-day trial, the court submitted the case to the jury but declined to allow the jury to consider awarding punitive damages. The jury returned a general verdict for McDonough and awarded him $300,000 in lost wages and emotional distress damages. The City moved for judgment as a matter of law on the ground that McDonough had not presented sufficient evidence to ground the jury's retaliation finding and, alternatively, moved to have the damage award remitted. The district court denied the motion and entered judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. The City's Appeal</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Claim Preclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The City asserts that McDonough's action should have been dismissed as it was barred under the claim preclusion doctrine as a result of an unsuccessful Massachusetts state court action that McDonough filed against the City in 1999. In 1998, McDonough was passed over for promotion to police captain and subsequently sued the City in Massachusetts Superior Court, claiming that he had been denied the promotion in retaliation for his complaint to Sheets in 1997. The case went to trial in 2003, and a state court judge entered judgment for the City at the close of McDonough's case-in-chief. The City argues that the state and federal actions are identical and that the federal action is therefore barred. It bases this argument on a foundational assertion that both cases center on the page of Coletta allegations that McDonough first presented to Sheets at their 1997 meeting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected this argument on the ground that the federal and state actions are distinct. The court viewed the state action as based primarily on the alleged retaliatory conduct by Sheets after the 1997 meeting, while the federal action is based primarily on retaliation perpetrated by members of the department after McDonough helped Coletta in 1999. We review this determination de novo. <i>See Maher v.

The transaction on which the state action was based was McDonough's failure to be appointed captain in 1998, which he attributed to retaliation orchestrated by Sheets for exercising his First Amendment rights in 1997. The transactions on which the federal suit is based were McDonough's transfer and his placement on administrative leave, which he claims were ordered by members of the department after they learned in 2000 that he had assisted Coletta in her lawsuit. McDonough's suits against the City were premised on separate acts of protected conduct that occurred years apart. Moreover, the allegedly retaliatory actions were ordered by different City agents over a several year period. These differences support the district court's ruling that the federal action is not barred. <i>See, e.g., Gonzalez-Pina v.

It focuses instead on the evidence that McDonough presented to undermine the City's asserted reasons for taking the challenged employment actions. As discussed above, the jury was presented with two adverse employment actions: McDonough's reassignment to the day shift and his placement on administrative leave. We consider whether McDonough presented sufficient evidence of pretext such that the jury could conclude that retaliation was the real motive for each of the challenged actions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chief Frane ordered McDonough's transfer to the day shift within days of learning that McDonough had assisted Coletta in pursuing her sex discrimination claim.

One way is for the plaintiff to show that the employer gave \"different and arguably inconsistent explanations\" for taking the adverse employment action. <i>Dominguez-Cruz v.

When McDonough first confronted Frane about the transfer, Frane told him that it was because he had \"trouble communicating\" and that, if he did not like it, he \"could retire.\" Several months later, when McDonough again asked Frane why he had been transferred, Frane stated that \"some city councilors wanted to put additional funding into the drug unit,\" and that the transfer was intended to help secure this funding. At trial, Frane testified that the transfer was part of a \"major transformation\" of the department and that it was designed to integrate McDonough into the department's management team. These shifting explanations provided a basis for the jury to conclude that the reason the City presented at trial was false.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, there was testimony from two police captains, who attended management meetings with Chief Frane just before the transfer, that there was no discussion of restructuring the drug unit. The jury could have concluded that this evidence was inconsistent with the City's contention that the transfer decision was a part of a systemic restructuring process. <i>See Reeves v.

Acting Chief Kelly, the person who decided to place McDonough on leave, testified that it was common knowledge that McDonough often became highly emotional but that he would quickly calm down. This testimony was given during Kelly's account of his conversation with McDonough that led him to be primarily concerned that McDonough might have a heart attack. Kelly admitted that he did not perceive McDonough to be a safety threat when this conversation occurred. Moreover, no one in the department investigated McDonough's letter to Madden to determine the basis and motivation for his statements. From this evidence, the jury could infer that Kelly, Madden, and Falco used McDonough's phone call and letter to establish a pretextual safety rationale for the decision to put McDonough on administrative leave.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, a jury could view the actions that Kelly and Falco took when they informed McDonough that he was being placed on leave as tending to undermine the asserted safety rationale. Falco testified that he was so concerned about the possibility of McDonough becoming violent that he wore a bullet-proof vest to the meeting at which Kelly informed McDonough of the decision to place him on leave. But Kelly did not take any such precautions for himself or his secretary who was sitting directly outside of the door to the office in which the meeting was held. Nor did Kelly or Falco arrange to have an officer on alert in case the meeting turned violent. And, after the meeting, no one at the department checked to see if McDonough had other weapons in his possession, alerted McDonough's family that he was a potential danger to himself or others, or arranged to ensure that McDonough traveled home safely. Indeed, the next contact between the department and McDonough did not occur until several days later, when someone from the department called to provide him with the details of his fitness-for-duty evaluation. Though the inference is not inevitable, the jury reasonably could have concluded that this is not how experienced police officers would have handled placing an officer on leave if they truly believed that he posed a safety risk. <i>See Hodgens v.

Here, there is evidence that McDonough filed one prior lawsuit against the City after he was denied a promotion. But, while that lawsuit was unsuccessful, there is nothing suggesting that it was fraudulently filed. <i>See Mathis v.

We disagree with the City's characterization of the district court's ruling. The City was permitted to ask McDonough about his strained relationships with certain department officials, to introduce the fact that McDonough had sued the City on a prior occasion, and to present documents highlighting various points of dispute between McDonough and the department. The ruling in question involved the court telling the City to \"move on\" after counsel had asked McDonough several repetitive questions about his relationship with Captain Falco.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Fed.R.Evid. 403, the district court retains discretion to \"prevent the needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\" <i>Donovan v.

Even if this information should not have been presented to the jury, the City did not timely object to the chalk, and the court <i>sua sponte</i> explained that the jury should not infer anything from the amount of the Coletta settlement. \"We have held, [that] the potential for prejudice...

The City contends that these statements were hearsay and could not be received as admissions under Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(D) because the declarants were not \"policymakers,\" (which the City would limit in this case to the chief of police and the mayor).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For a statement to be an admission under Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(D), it must be made by a party, a party's agent, or a servant within the scope of an agency or employment. <i>See Gomez v.

After the close of the evidence, the district court directed a verdict for the City on these claims and only permitted the jury to consider the transfer and leave allegations. The City contends that the district court's charge did not adequately explain that McDonough's claim was limited to those allegations.

McDonough lost some salary due to the City's actions, but acknowledges on appeal that the bulk of the award was for emotional distress. McDonough testified that he had been a Quincy police officer for over thirty years and that he \"loved [his] job.\" In light of his commitment to his job as a police officer, McDonough claimed that the City's actions caused him substantial humiliation and damage to his reputation. As a result of this trauma, McDonough claimed that his relationship with his family suffered.

But with the benefit of hindsight, we part ways with the district court in its conclusion that no reasonable jury could award punitive damages on the evidence presented.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The City argues that there was no evidence that its agents acted with reckless indifference to McDonough's Title VII rights because it presented legitimate non-retaliatory reasons for its actions. This argument fails because the jury found that the City (through its agents) intentionally retaliated against McDonough and therefore rejected these reasons as the basis for the City's actions. There was proof introduced by McDonough that the department published an anti-discrimination policy and provided anti-discrimination training for its workforce. <i>See Rodriguez-Torres,</i> 399 F.3d at 65 (stating that a punitive damages instruction was appropriate where the employer posted signs notifying employees about the anti-discrimination laws).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Moreover, the retaliating employees were all high-ranking department officials involved in personnel management. In light of the important role that Title VII plays in modern personnel management, we cannot conclude on this record that a reasonable jury would be compelled to find that these officials were unaware that retaliating against an employee for assisting with another employee's sexual harassment claim violates federal law. <i>See Powell v. Alexander,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201350\"><a href=\"/opinion/201350/powell-v-alexander/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 20 (1st Cir.2004) (stating that city solicitor, by nature of her position as an attorney, knew or should have known that retaliating against a public employee for filing a lawsuit is unlawful); <i>DiMarco-Zappa v. Cabanillas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771817\"><a href=\"/opinion/771817/joanna-dimarco-zappa-v-eugenio-cabanillas-federico-ced-alzamora-mary-jo/\"><span class=\"volume\">238</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 38 (1st Cir.2001) (stating that \"the extent of federal statutory and constitutional law preventing discrimination ... suggests that defendants had to know that such discrimination was illegal\"). The evidence was therefore adequate for a rational jury to conclude that the City acted with reckless indifference to McDonough's Title VII rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As discussed above, malice and reckless indifference concern, not the employer's awareness that it is discriminating, but the employer's knowledge that it is acting in violation of federal law. In <i>Kolstad,</i> the Supreme Court provided examples of situations in which intentional discrimination does not give rise to punitive damages. 527 U.S. at 536-37, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118313\"><a href=\"/opinion/118313/kolstad-v-american-dental-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2118</span></a></span>. Such situations may occur where the employer believes that it can lawfully discriminate, where the theory of discrimination is novel or poorly recognized, or where the employer believes that its discrimination falls within a statutory exception. <i>Id.; see Farias v. Instructional Sys., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774268\"><a href=\"/opinion/774268/nelson-a-farias-and-angela-m-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">259</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">91</span></a></span>, 102 (2d Cir.2001) (concluding that no punitive damages instruction was warranted under <i>Kolstad</i> in a retaliation case where the employer took the retaliatory act on advice of counsel that its conduct was lawful). A jury could conclude that the City's conduct falls into none of these categories. Accordingly, the jury should have been permitted to consider awarding punitive damages for the Title VII violation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion obliges us to consider the scope of our remand. McDonough contends that retrial must be limited to the punitive damages question. In support of this argument, he cites <i>Che,</i> 342 F.3d at 31, where we remanded solely for a retrial on punitive damages while allowing an emotional distress award to stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fifth Circuit has identified a potential problem in remanding a case for a trial limited solely to punitive damages where the first jury awarded emotional distress damages. <i>See Hardin v. Caterpillar, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"22040\"><a href=\"/opinion/22040/hardin-v-caterpillar-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">227</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">268</span></a></span>, 272 (5th Cir.2000). As the court explained, \"the difficulty inheres in the very nature of a jury's decisionmaking.\" <i>Id.</i> Emotional distress damages are \"the classic black box decision\" because the precise sum of emotional damages cannot be independently quantified. <i>Id.</i> A jury awards such damages based on the degree of emotional harm that it believes that the plaintiff endured. But, especially where there is limited evidence of the plaintiff's physical symptoms, this award is closely linked to the jury's view concerning the defendant's unlawful conduct. <i>See id.</i> In other words, the jury's conclusion about the plaintiff's level of emotional trauma might well reflect its view concerning the reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct. <i>See id.</i> This potential overlap creates a risk that the plaintiff will recover twice for the reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct, if a second jury is allowed to consider only punitive damages. <i>See id.; see also Coastal Fuels of P.R. v. Caribbean Petroleum Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196628\"><a href=\"/opinion/196628/coastal-fuels-of-pr-v-caribbean-petroleum/\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">182</span></a></span>, 201 (1st Cir.1996) (\"The law abhors duplicative recoveries.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not to say that a serious risk of double recovery exists in every case. In <i>Che,</i> for example, the emotional distress award was relatively low ($125,000), given the evidence of emotional injury. <i>See</i> 342 F.3d at 36 (the plaintiff suffered several diagnosed mental and physical disorders). In those circumstances, we determined that it was permissible to remand for a retrial limited to punitive damages. <i>Id.</i> at 34. But in reaching this conclusion, we recognized that this ruling was discretionary and that an \"appellate court has broad discretion to remand for a new trial on all, or only some of the issues in the case.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As <i>Hardin</i> recognized, whether a retrial limited to punitive damages would be fair must be decided case by case. <i>See</i> 227 F.3d at 273. The emotional distress award in this case, unlike the award in <i>Che,</i> was generous in light of the limited evidence that McDonough presented. Some reason for concern therefore exists, a concern that was absent in <i>Che,</i> that the high award may partly reflect punishment for what the jury may have concluded was the degree of reprehensibility of the City's conduct. <i>See Horney v. Westfield Gage Co.,</i> 77 Fed.Appx. 24, 33 (1st Cir.2003) (unpublished disposition) (concluding that a retrial limited to punitive damages may be unfair because the issues of intent, emotional distress damages, and punitive damages were \"so intertwined\"). That said, the district court is in a better position to make the judgment call because it viewed McDonough's evidence of emotional distress first hand. <i>See id.</i> at 33. If the district court determines that the punitive damages issue should not be tried alone, the court should so indicate and provide McDonough the opportunity to accept the $300,000 compensatory award and withdraw his punitive damages claim. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.

Browning-Ferris Indus.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">691</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">526</span></span>, 537 (1998). For the reasons stated above, the evidence was sufficient for a jury to have concluded that the City acted with \"reckless indifference\" to McDonough's rights under the Massachusetts anti-discrimination laws. <i>See id.</i> (suggesting that punitive damages would have been warranted if there was evidence that employer knowingly violated an anti-discrimination law).</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
