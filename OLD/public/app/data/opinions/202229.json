George, Jr., was\n\nconvicted of four counts of tax evasion, see 26 U.S.C. § 7201, and\n\nsentenced to thirty months' imprisonment. George says the district\n\ncourt plainly erred in failing to instruct the jury on an obvious\n\n(but unargued) defense theory.          He also challenges the denial of\n\nhis motion for a new trial.       We affirm.\n\n                                       I.\n\n            We present the facts in the light most favorable to the\n\nverdict.    See United States v. Medina-Martinez, 396 F.3d 1, 3 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).        George is a self-taught chemist who operated a\n\nnutritional supplement business out of his home in Rockport,\n\nMassachusetts.      George, who holds five patents, researched and\n\ndeveloped    his    supplements   at    various   Boston-area   university\n\nlaboratories and libraries.\n\n            George's business dealings generally took two forms.\n\nFirst, he provided research services, raw materials, and finished\n\nsupplements to various health supplement companies.             Second, he\n\ndirectly administered supplements for a host of maladies from his\n\nfront porch to various individuals and groups that came to see him\n\nin Rockport.   In both lines of business, George typically required\n\npayment in advance (by cash or check, with a preference for cash)\n\nand steadfastly refused to provide receipts or other documentation\n\nof his sales and services.        He ultimately accumulated over six\n\nmillion dollars in various bank accounts.\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\f          Through a series of events, including investigations by\n\nthe Drug Enforcement Administration and New Jersey authorities who\n\nwere looking into the murder of George's friend and business\n\nassociate,    Richard   Breitbarth,   George's   business   came    under\n\nscrutiny by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The IRS discovered\n\nthat George had never paid taxes on any of his business income.         An\n\nIRS agent interviewed George, who maintained that he neither\n\nprovided research services for pay nor sold supplements or their\n\nconstituent raw materials.     Instead, George stated that all the\n\nmonies that he had received were \"gifts\" or \"donations\" from his\n\npatrons, who supported his goal of building a non-profit research\n\nlaboratory.     In 2003, George was indicted on four counts of tax\n\nevasion for the years 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999.\n\n          At trial, the government called several of George's\n\nclients, who testified that they had paid for products or services\n\nand that their payments were not gifts or donations.        One witness\n\ntestified that George increased the price of one of his products\n\nninefold when it began to achieve commercial success.              Another\n\ntestified that George called him after the indictment to do \"damage\n\ncontrol\" and offered to refund all monies that the client had paid\n\nif the client would sign a statement that the payments had been\n\ndonations.\n\n          Three New Jersey detectives who had investigated the\n\nBreitbarth murder testified that George had made no mention of\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fgifts or donations, but rather acknowledged a business relationship\n\nwith Breitbarth which included George's receiving payments for his\n\nresearch services twice a month.            Two IRS agents testified about\n\nthe aforementioned IRS interview, George's bank accounts,1 and his\n\ntax deficiency. The government established income of approximately\n\n$900,000 for the relevant years, which yielded a tax liability of\n\napproximately $252,000.       The government's case emphasized two\n\nprimary acts of evasion by George: (1) using false Social Security\n\nnumbers to open bank accounts, see supra note 1; and (2) making\n\nfalse statements to the IRS about the nature of his activities.2\n\n           George did not take the stand, but called witnesses and\n\npresented documentary evidence.         The defense maintained that the\n\nmonies George received were non-taxable gifts or donations.             The\n\ndefense   painted   George   as   a   reclusive    and   eccentric   genius,\n\nemphasizing that he lived as a pauper in a small house supported\n\nonly by Social Security disability payments of approximately $9,000\n\na year.   The defense called attention to the fact that George had\n\n\n\n1\n   George had opened fifteen bank accounts at ten different banks\nusing seven different Social Security numbers and transferred large\nsums between the accounts. The Social Security numbers utilized\nincluded his actual Social Security number and six false numbers,\nwhich generally contained transpositions of his actual number. The\ndifferent Social Security numbers made it difficult for the IRS to\ntrack George's interest income.\n2\n  To convict a defendant of tax evasion, the prosecutor must prove\na tax deficiency, an affirmative act constituting an evasion, and\nwillfulness. See United States v. Lavoie, 433 F.3d 95, 97 (1st\nCir. 2005).\n\n                                      -4-\n\fnever used any of the supplement proceeds for himself, but had\n\nsaved the money with the goal of building a non-profit research\n\nfoundation.     Finally, the defense highlighted the fact that,\n\nfollowing his indictment, George had established the Biogenesis\n\nFoundation, Inc., which received tax-exempt status from the IRS\n\nunder 26 U.S.C. § 501(c)(3).3\n\n            As to the evasion issue, the defense suggested that the\n\nuse   of   incorrect    Social      Security    numbers    at    some   banks   was\n\naccidental    and    caused    by    George's      quirkiness.      The    defense\n\nemphasized that all the other information that George provided to\n\nthe banks, including his name and address, was accurate.                  As to the\n\nstatements to the IRS agent, the defense argued that George was\n\ngenuinely confused about whether the payments he received were\n\ntaxable    because     he   intended    to   use    them   for   his    charitable\n\nfoundation.\n\n            The jury convicted George on all counts.               Subsequently,\n\nGeorge hired new counsel and moved for a new trial on the basis of\n\nnewly discovered evidence in the form of (1) five Social Security\n\nAdministration and Bureau of Prison documents from the 1970's and\n\nearly 1980's which contained inaccurate Social Security numbers for\n\n\n\n3\n    Section 501(c)(3) provides an exemption from taxation for\n\"[c]orporations . . . organized and operated exclusively for\nreligious, charitable, scientific, testing for public safety,\nliterary, or education purposes . . . [so long as] no part of the\nnet earnings of [the corporation] inures to the benefit of any\nprivate shareholder or individual . . . .\" 26 U.S.C. § 501(c)(3).\n\n                                       -5-\n\fGeorge; (2) post-conviction reports by psychiatrists opining that\n\nGeorge suffered from Asperger's Syndrome, a mental disorder; and\n\n(3) an expert report opining that the sales income was not taxable\n\nbecause   George    was    operating       a    tax-exempt     \"social      welfare\n\norganization\" pursuant to 26 U.S.C. § 501(c)(4).4                    The district\n\ncourt   denied   the    motion     and   sentenced    George    to     30   months'\n\nimprisonment.    This appeal followed.\n\n                                         II.\n\n           George      presents    us    with   two   arguments.        First,   he\n\ncontends that the district court committed plain error in failing\n\nto   instruct    the    jury      sua    sponte   about      Section     501(c)(4)\n\norganizations.     Second, he argues that the district court erred in\n\ndenying his motion for a new trial.5\n\n\n4\n   Section 501(c)(4) provides a tax-exemption for \"organizations\nnot organized for profit but operated exclusively for the promotion\nof social welfare . . . the net earnings of which are devoted\nexclusively to charitable, educational, or recreational purposes .\n. . \" with the limitation that the exemption \"shall not apply to an\nentity unless no part of the net earnings of such entity inures to\nthe benefit of any private shareholder or individual.\" 26 U.S.C.\n§ 501(c)(4).\n     Generally speaking, the primary differences between Section\n501(c)(3) organizations and Section 501(c)(4) organizations are\nthat contributions to the former are tax deductible while those to\nthe latter are not, and the latter can engage in some political\nactivities while the former cannot. See generally Federal Election\nComm'n v. Beaumont, 539 U.S. 146, 150 n.1 (2003).\n5\n   George's brief hints at additional due process arguments but\nfails to develop them sufficiently to warrant further mention. See\nUnited States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990). George\nalso criticizes trial counsel's performance, but fact-specific\nclaims of ineffective assistance of counsel must be pursued via 28\nU.S.C. § 2255. See United States v. Mercedes Mercedes, 428 F.3d\n\n                                         -6-\n\fA. Jury Instruction\n\n          George argues that the district court plainly erred in\n\nfailing to instruct the jury sua sponte about § 501(c)(4) because\n\nevidence at trial made the applicability of a defense based upon\n\nthis statute \"obvious.\"     George asserts that such an instruction\n\nwould have resulted in an acquittal because George was \"obviously\"\n\nrunning a non-profit scientific foundation, and sales by such an\n\nentity are exempt from federal taxation.           The absence of a §\n\n501(c)(4) instruction was especially harmful, George says, because\n\nthe district court inaccurately instructed the jury that George's\n\nincome was either taxable sales income or a product of tax-exempt\n\ngifts and donations.   We disagree.\n\n          George   concedes   that    he   did   not   request   such   an\n\ninstruction in a timely manner, and that our review must be\n\nconducted for plain error pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 30(d) and\n\n52(b).   See Medina-Martinez, 396 F.3d at 8.           Thus, to prevail,\n\nGeorge must show \"that (1) an error occurred, (2) the error was\n\nclear or obvious, (3) the error affected his substantial rights,\n\nand (4) the error also seriously impaired the fairness, integrity,\n\nor public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"            Id.; see also\n\nUnited States v. Frady, 456 U.S. 152, 163 (1982) (failure to give\n\na particular instruction constituted an \"error so plain the trial\n\njudge and prosecutor were derelict in countenancing it, even absent\n\n\n355, 361 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                                 -7-\n\fthe defendant's timely assistance in detecting it\").              George's\n\nclaim fails for several reasons.\n\n          First,     George   is   claiming    an   entitlement    to   an\n\ninstruction that he did not suggest relating to a defense that he\n\ndid not assert.    \"Where a defendant does not offer a particular\n\ninstruction, and does not rely on the theory of defense embodied in\n\nthat instruction at trial, the district court's failure to offer an\n\ninstruction on that theory sua sponte is not plain error.\"         United\n\nStates v. Montgomery, 150 F.3d 983, 996 (9th Cir. 1998); cf. United\n\nStates v. Lebron-Cepeda, 324 F.3d 52, 60 (1st Cir. 2003)(per\n\ncuriam)(\"[I]t would be most unusual for us to find that a district\n\ncourt erred in failing to give a limiting instruction that was\n\nnever requested\").\n\n          Second, any § 501(c)(4) instruction would have been\n\ncontrary to the defense theory that George actually relied upon:\n\nthat the monies in question were gifts and donations from George's\n\npatrons to fund his research.      \"If an instruction is inconsistent\n\nwith the defense's theory of the case, it is inappropriate.\"\n\nUnited States v. Eberhart, 434 F.3d 935, 940        (7th Cir. 2006); see\n\nalso United States v. Fort, 998 F.2d 542, 547 (7th Cir. 1993).          The\n\ndistrict court is not required \"to embark on an intellectual frolic\n\nof its own and instruct the jury on a defense [that the defendant]\n\ndid not choose to assert and to prove.\"       United States v. Simmonds,\n\n931 F.2d 685, 688 (10th Cir. 1991).\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\f              Finally, George was entitled only to defense theory\n\ninstructions       \"for    which    there        [was]      sufficient       evidentiary\n\nsupport,\"      United States v. Lopez-Lopez, 282 F.3d 1, 18 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).      And the evidence here fell short of supporting a §\n\n501(c)(4) instruction.\n\n              To qualify for a § 501(c)(4) exemption, there must be (1)\n\nan organization, that (2) is not operated for profit, and that is\n\n(3) operated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare.                            See\n\n26   U.S.C.    §   501(c)(4);      26    C.F.R.      §    1.501(c)(4)-1.          Such    an\n\norganization does not operate exclusively for the promotion of\n\nsocial welfare if it \"is carrying on business with the general\n\npublic in a manner similar to organizations which are operated for\n\nprofit.\"      26 C.F.R. § 1.501(c)(4)-1(a)(2)(ii).\n\n              George dealt in health products, but that does not\n\nautomatically mean that he worked for general social welfare,\n\nparticularly when his products were offered only to a select\n\nclientele rather than the public at large.                           See generally IHC\n\nHealth Plans, Inc. v. Comm'r of Internal Revenue, 325 F.3d 1188,\n\n1197-98 (10th Cir. 2003)(not every activity that promotes health is\n\nentitled to a tax-exemption).             Additionally, the evidence suggests\n\nthat George did not operate an \"organization,\" given that he failed\n\nto engage in any traditional business behavior, such as maintaining\n\nrecords,      hiring   employees,         or   maintaining           a   formal   office.\n\nFinally,    George's      revenue       from   the       sale   of   his   products      far\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\fexceeded his costs, and he deposited this profit into bank accounts\n\nthat he exclusively controlled.          That George may have intended to\n\nplace these proceeds into a tax-exempt organization at some future\n\npoint does not alter the fact that they were business profits\n\navailable for his use.      See 26 U.S.C. § 502 (profits of business\n\nnot tax-exempt simply because profits ultimately paid to tax-exempt\n\norganization).      In the end, George's business did not differ\n\nsignificantly     from    other        for-profit     suppliers     of   health\n\nsupplements.     Cf. Federated Pharmacy Servs., Inc. v. Commissioner\n\nof Internal Revenue, 625 F.2d 804, 808 (8th Cir. 1980)(defendant\n\nsold   prescription      drugs    to     public     and   that    activity   was\n\npresumptively commercial).6\n\nB.   New Trial\n\n            George contends that the evidence he submitted post-trial\n\nof five prior \"innocent\" misstatements of his Social Security\n\nnumber eviscerates the government's case on the issue of evasion.\n\nGeorge significantly overstates the exculpatory value of this\n\nevidence.\n\n            A defendant is entitled to a new trial on the basis of\n\nnewly discovered evidence only if he can establish that (1) the\n\n\n6\n  That George received Section 501(c)(3) status for his foundation\npost-indictment is of no consequence. The IRS's decision to grant\nSection 501(c)(3) status is based entirely on the applicant's\nunverified representations, and George's representations in the\napplication were greatly at odds with the evidence at trial. See\nZimmerman v. Cambridge Credit Counseling Corp., 409 F.3d 473, 476-\n77 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                                       -10-\n\fevidence was unavailable or unknown at the time of trial; (2) the\n\ndefendant's failure to uncover the evidence earlier was not due to\n\na lack of diligence; (3) the tendered evidence is material and not\n\nsimply impeaching or cumulative; and (4) the new evidence will\n\nprobably result in an acquittal if the defendant is retried.\n\nUnited States v. Rodriguez-Marrero, 390 F.3d 1, 14 (1st Cir. 2004),\n\ncert. denied, 544 U.S. 912 (2005).          \"For newly discovered evidence\n\nto warrant a retrial in a criminal case, the existence of the\n\nrequired probability of reversal must be gauged by an objectively\n\nreasonable appraisal of the record as a whole, not on the basis of\n\nwishful   thinking,   rank   conjecture,      or    unsupportable    surmise.\"\n\nUnited States v. Natanel, 938 F.2d 302, 314 (1st Cir. 1991).                We\n\nreview a district court's denial of a motion for a new trial for\n\nmanifest abuse of discretion.        United States v. Rivera Rangel, 396\n\nF.3d 476, 485-86 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n           The   district    court    did     not    manifestly     abuse   its\n\ndiscretion in concluding that George's \"new\" evidence, if admitted\n\nat trial, was unlikely to result in an acquittal.                 Most of the\n\ntendered misstatements were made by third parties inputting data.\n\nFurther, at trial, the IRS agent testified that George had no\n\ndifficulty recalling his Social Security number at his interview.\n\nAnd most significantly, the accounts that George used for his\n\nSocial Security disability benefits utilized his correct number,\n\nwhile the accounts containing the much larger income that he had\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\flied about all utilized incorrect numbers.     George's new evidence\n\ncreates no realistic likelihood of acquittal. See generally United\n\nStates v. Villarman-Oviedo, 325 F.3d 1, 15 (1st Cir. 2003)(a new\n\ntrial     warranted only \"where the evidence preponderates heavily\n\nagainst the verdict\")(internal citation and quotation omitted).\n\n                                 III.\n\n            For the reasons stated above, George's conviction is\n\naffirmed.    In light of our holding, George's pending bail motion is\n\ndenied.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\f",

The absence of a &#167; 501(c)(4) instruction was especially harmful, George says, because the district court inaccurately instructed the jury that George's income was either taxable sales income or a product of tax-exempt gifts and donations. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">George concedes that he did not request such an instruction in a timely manner, and that our review must be conducted for plain error pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 30(d) and 52(b). <i>See Medina-Martinez,</i> 396 F.3d at 8. Thus, to prevail, George must show \"that (1) an error occurred, (2) the error was clear or obvious, (3) the error affected his substantial rights, and (4) the error also seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>Id.; see also United States v. Frady,</i> 456 U.S. 152, 163, 102 S.Ct. 1584, 71 L.Ed.2d 816 (1982) (failure to give a particular instruction constituted an \"error so plain the trial judge and prosecutor were derelict in countenancing it, even absent the defendant's timely assistance in detecting it\"). George's claim fails for several reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, George is claiming an entitlement to an instruction that he did not suggest relating to a defense that he did not assert. \"Where a defendant does not offer a particular instruction, and does not rely on the theory of defense embodied in that instruction at trial, the district court's failure to offer an instruction on that theory <i>sua sponte</i> is not plain error.\" <i>United States v. Montgomery,</i> 150 F.3d 983, 996 (9th Cir.1998); <i>cf. United States v. Lebron-Cepeda,</i> 324 F.3d 52, 60 (1st Cir. 2003)(per curiam)(\"[I]t would be most unusual for us to find that a district court erred in failing to give a limiting instruction that was never requested\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, any &#167; 501(c)(4) instruction would have been contrary to the defense theory that George actually relied upon: that the monies in question were gifts and donations from George's patrons to fund his research. \"If an instruction is inconsistent with the defense's theory of the case, it is inappropriate.\" <i>United States v. Eberhart,</i> 434 F.3d 935, 940 (7th Cir.2006); <i>see also United States v. Fort,</i> 998 F.2d 542, 547 (7th Cir.1993). The district court is not required \"to embark on an intellectual frolic of its own and instruct the jury on a defense [that the defendant] did not choose to assert and to prove.\" <i>United States v. Simmonds,</i> 931 F.2d 685, 688 (10th Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, George was entitled only to defense theory instructions \"for which there [was] sufficient evidentiary support,\" <i>United States v. Lopez-Lopez,</i> 282 F.3d 1, 18 (1st Cir.2002). And the evidence here fell short of supporting a &#167; 501(c)(4) instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To qualify for a &#167; 501(c)(4) exemption, there must be (1) an organization, that (2) is not operated for profit, and that is (3) operated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare. <i>See</i> 26 U.S.C. &#167; 501(c)(4); 26 C.F.R. &#167; 1.501(c)(4)-1. Such an organization does not operate exclusively for the promotion of social welfare if it \"is carrying on business with the general public in a manner similar to organizations which are operated for profit.\" 26 C.F.R. &#167; 1.501(c)(4)-1(a)(2)(ii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">George dealt in health products, but that does not automatically mean that he worked for general social welfare, particularly when his products were offered only to a select clientele rather than the public at large. <i>See generally IHC Health Plans, Inc. v. Comm'r of Internal Revenue,</i> 325 F.3d 1188, 1197-98 (10th Cir. 2003)(not every activity that promotes health is entitled to a tax-exemption). Additionally, the evidence suggests that George did not operate an \"organization,\" given that he failed to engage in any traditional business behavior, such as maintaining records, hiring employees, or maintaining a formal office. Finally, George's revenue from the sale of his products far exceeded his costs, and he deposited this profit into bank accounts that he exclusively controlled. That George may have intended to place these proceeds into a tax-exempt organization at some future point does not alter the fact that they were business profits available for his use. <i>See</i> 26 U.S.C. &#167; 502 (profits of business not tax-exempt simply because profits ultimately paid to tax-exempt organization). In the end, George's business did not differ significantly from other for-profit suppliers of health supplements. <i>Cf. Federation Pharmacy Servs., Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue,</i> 625 F.2d 804, 808 (8th Cir.1980)(defendant sold prescription drugs to public and that activity was presumptively commercial).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>B.

George significantly overstates the exculpatory value of this evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A defendant is entitled to a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence only if he can establish that (1) the evidence was unavailable or unknown at the time of trial; (2) the defendant's failure to uncover the evidence earlier was not due to a lack of diligence; (3) the tendered evidence is material and not simply impeaching or cumulative; and (4) the new evidence will probably result in an acquittal if the defendant is retried. <i>United States v. Rodriguez-Marrero,</i> 390 F.3d 1, 14 (1st Cir.2004), <i>cert. denied,</i> 544 U.S. 912, 125 S.Ct. 1620, 161 L.Ed.2d 292 (2005). \"For newly discovered evidence to warrant a retrial in a criminal case, the existence of the required probability of reversal must be gauged by an objectively reasonable appraisal of the record as a whole, not on the basis of wishful thinking, rank conjecture, or unsupportable surmise.\" <i>United States v. Natanel,</i> 938 F.2d 302, 314 (1st Cir.1991). We review a district court's denial of a motion for a new trial for manifest abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Rivera Rangel,</i> 396 F.3d 476, 485-86 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not manifestly abuse its discretion in concluding that George's \"new\" evidence, if admitted at trial, was unlikely to result in an acquittal. Most of the tendered misstatements were made by third parties inputting data. Further, at trial, the IRS agent testified that George had no difficulty recalling his Social Security number at his interview. And most significantly, the accounts that George used for his Social Security disability benefits utilized his correct number, while the accounts containing the much larger income that he had lied about all utilized incorrect numbers. George's new evidence creates no realistic likelihood of acquittal. <i>See generally United States v. Villarman-Oviedo,</i> 325 F.3d 1, 15 (1st Cir. 2003)(a new trial warranted only \"where the evidence preponderates heavily against the verdict\")(internal citation and quotation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, George's conviction is <i>affirmed.</i> In light of our holding, George's pending bail motion is <i>denied.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> George had opened fifteen bank accounts at ten different banks using seven different Social Security numbers and transferred large sums between the accounts.

Thus, to prevail, George must show \"that (1) an error occurred, (2) the error was clear or obvious, (3) the error affected his substantial rights, and (4) the error also seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>Id.; see also United States v.

Such an organization does not operate exclusively for the promotion of social welfare if it \"is carrying on business with the general public in a manner similar to organizations which are operated for profit.\" 26 C.F.R. &#167; 1.501(c)(4)-1(a)(2)(ii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">George dealt in health products, but that does not automatically mean that he worked for general social welfare, particularly when his products were offered only to a select clientele rather than the public at large. <i>See generally IHC Health Plans, Inc. v.

Additionally, the evidence suggests that George did not operate an \"organization,\" given that he failed to engage in any traditional business behavior, such as maintaining records, hiring employees, or maintaining a formal office. Finally, George's revenue from the sale of his products far exceeded his costs, and he deposited this profit into bank accounts that he exclusively controlled. That George may have intended to place these proceeds into a tax-exempt organization at some future point does not alter the fact that they were business profits available for his use. <i>See</i> 26 U.S.C. &#167; 502 (profits of business not tax-exempt simply because profits ultimately paid to tax-exempt organization). In the end, George's business did not differ significantly from other for-profit suppliers of health supplements. <i>Cf. Federation Pharmacy Servs., Inc. v.

Most of the tendered misstatements were made by third parties inputting data. Further, at trial, the IRS agent testified that George had no difficulty recalling his Social Security number at his interview. And most significantly, the accounts that George used for his Social Security disability benefits utilized his correct number, while the accounts containing the much larger income that he had lied about all utilized incorrect numbers. George's new evidence creates no realistic likelihood of acquittal. <i>See generally United States v.
