Plaintiff-Appellee    Yonatta\n\nCrispin-Taveras (\"Crispin\") brought a civil rights action against\n\nDefendants-Appellants Municipality of Carolina (the \"Municipality\")\n\nand various Municipality police officers.               The district court\n\ndefaulted the defendants for discovery violations.             After a jury\n\ntrial on damages, the district court entered a judgment in favor of\n\nCrispin in the amount of $75,000.                The Municipality and the\n\nindividual officers now appeal, challenging the default sanction,\n\nthe   admission   of    psychological       treatment   evidence,   the   jury\n\ninstructions, and the sufficiency of service of process.             For the\n\nreasons stated below, we affirm.\n\n                                 I. BACKGROUND\n\nA.    Factual Background\n\n            During a baseball game between the Puerto Rico national\n\nteam and the Dominican Republic national team held at the Roberto\n\nClemente Stadium in Carolina, Puerto Rico, in 2007, a spectator\n\nknown as \"Oscar\" was celebrating in the aisles with a Dominican\n\nflag. The Carolina Municipal Police Department intervened in order\n\nto eject Oscar from the stadium.\n\n            Crispin, a U.S. Marine from the Dominican Republic, was\n\nat the game wearing a hat with the insignia of the Dominican flag.\n\nHe became involved in the confrontation and alleged that the police\n\nofficers violently grabbed and removed him from the stands, struck\n\nhim in the head with a metal baton, and then handcuffed and\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fdetained him in the stadium detention center.               He was eventually\n\ntransported to a hospital where he received stitches to close a\n\nwound to his head.\n\n             Both sides faced criminal charges.            Crispin was charged\n\nwith aggravated assault and destruction of property, but the\n\ncharges were dismissed.          Three of the officers, Lieutenant John\n\nCruz-González     (\"Cruz\"),    Sergeant      Luis   Díaz-Ruiz   (\"Díaz\"),   and\n\nOfficer Karimar Peraza-Delgado (\"Peraza\") were indicted on federal\n\ncivil rights violations, but were acquitted.\n\nB.   Procedural Background\n\n             On October 25, 2007, Crispin filed a civil rights action\n\nin the District of Puerto Rico against the Municipality, the mayor\n\nof   the    Municipality,     an   association      of   Municipality   police\n\nofficers, two Commonwealth of Puerto Rico police officers, and\n\nthree insurance companies.          He also named as defendants various\n\nindividual Municipality police officers, including Captain Rubén\n\nMoyeno     (\"Moyeno\"),   Cruz,     Peraza,    and   Díaz    (collectively   the\n\n\"individual defendants\").\n\n             1.   Service of Process\n\n             On April 3, 2008, Moyeno filed a motion to dismiss, and\n\nCruz, Díaz, and Peraza filed a motion to join it.                They alleged\n\nthey were served with the summons and complaint on February 28 and\n\n29, 2008, which was more than 120 days after the filing of the\n\ncomplaint in violation of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(m).\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fCrispin responded that dismissal was not required because there was\n\nno prejudice and Rule 4(m) allows the district court to direct\n\nservice by a specified time, which was now unnecessary because the\n\ndefendants were served.     The district court denied the motions.\n\n           The Municipality filed an answer on September 4, 2008,\n\nand the individual defendants filed an answer on September 26,\n\n2008.   The individual defendants later filed a motion to withdraw\n\ntheir answer because they alleged that Cruz, Díaz, and Peraza were\n\nincluded in the answer by \"human error.\"         The district court\n\ngranted the motion and allowed the withdrawal of their answer.\n\n           In February 2009, Peraza and Cruz filed a motion to\n\ndismiss for improper service.    They alleged that Crispin failed to\n\neffectuate personal service and failed to do so within the time\n\nafforded by Rule 4(m).      In opposition, Crispin argued that the\n\ndefendants did not challenge the method of service in their April\n\n2008 motion to dismiss.        He further argued that service was\n\nproperly executed upon an attorney in the Municipality’s legal\n\ndepartment.     The district court denied the motion.\n\n           2.    Discovery Disputes\n\n           In December 2008, Crispin filed a motion to compel,\n\nalleging that the individual defendants had failed to produce Rule\n\n26 disclosures or answer Crispin's interrogatories or requests for\n\nproduction.     The individual defendants opposed the motion, arguing\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fthat they were not aware of any unproduced documents. The district\n\ncourt denied Crispin's motion without prejudice.\n\n            After a stay of the case during the pendency of the\n\nfederal   criminal   proceedings,    the   district    court   conducted   a\n\nscheduling conference.      See Fed. R. Civ. P. 16.             During the\n\nconference, the district court ordered the defendants to answer all\n\npending written discovery requests within ten days and ordered\n\ndiscovery to be completed by June 30, 2009.           Moyeno sent his Rule\n\n26 initial disclosures to Crispin the day after the conference.\n\n            On June 11, 2009, Crispin filed a motion for sanctions\n\nagainst the Municipality, Cruz, Díaz, and Peraza, alleging they had\n\nfailed to provide Rule 26 disclosures or respond to discovery\n\nrequests.   The district court conducted a telephone conference on\n\nJune 24, 2009, and decided to hold the motion for sanctions in\n\nabeyance. Following the conference, the court issued the following\n\nruling:\n\n            Rule 26 Meeting Report due by 7/3/2009.     I\n            have noted the content of [Crispin's motion\n            for sanctions] and make reference to the\n            directions given by me during the telephone\n            conference held today.       If any of the\n            mentioned parties have failed to fully comply\n            with Rule 26 disclosures, then their last\n            clear chance for compliance is the date set\n            herein. Otherwise, sanctions will be imposed\n            including striking evidence not included in\n            Rule 26 disclosures. Be guided accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\f           On June 24, 2009, Crispin moved for entry of default\n\nagainst   Cruz,   Díaz,   and    Peraza     for    their   failure   to   file    a\n\nresponsive pleading.\n\n           Crispin also filed a motion on June 30, 2009, seeking\n\nadditional time for his expert report because Cruz, Díaz, and\n\nPeraza    never   answered      his   interrogatories       or   requests     for\n\nproduction of documents.        Another reason he sought additional time\n\nwas because the Municipality allegedly failed to comply with its\n\ncontinuing Rule 34 obligations.             See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26 & 34.\n\nDuring the depositions of the officers, Crispin learned that the\n\nMunicipality's    Internal      Affairs     Department     was   conducting      an\n\ninvestigation.      Crispin alleged that, besides a two-page sworn\n\nstatement by Díaz, the Municipality did not produce any documents\n\narising out of this investigation. The district court gave Crispin\n\nan extension to produce the expert report.\n\n           On July 4, 2009, Crispin filed a motion \"in compliance\n\nwith\" the district court's order holding Crispin's June 11, 2009\n\nmotion for sanctions in abeyance.                 Crispin requested numerous\n\nsanctions, including the imposition of a default judgment.\n\n           The defendants never filed an opposition to Crispin’s\n\nJune 11, 2009 motion for sanctions.          On July 8, 2009, the district\n\ncourt found the Municipality, Cruz, Díaz, and Peraza in default,\n\nconcluding:\n\n                    Having   examined  Defendants'   track\n           record    of   non-compliance  with   discovery\n\n                                      -7-\n\f           obligations, and considering the averments\n           contained in [Crispin's motions], the court\n           ORDERS as follows:\n\n                  Defendants Municipality of Carolina,\n           Karimar Peraza-Delgado, John Cruz-González,\n           and Luis Díaz-Ruiz will face sanctions for\n           their failure to comply with discovery\n           obligations. Plaintiff's factual allegations\n           are deemed admitted, Defendants' defenses and\n           pleadings are stricken, and a liability\n           default finding is made.\n\n           The Municipality filed a motion for reconsideration.              It\n\nalleged it sent initial Rule 26 disclosures and produced all\n\ndocuments in its possession.       In support, it attached a list of the\n\nexhibits it produced and a copy of its initial Rule 26 disclosures.\n\nCruz, Díaz, and Peraza joined and supplemented the Municipality's\n\nmotion.    They alleged that their default was not willful because\n\ntheir DOJ attorney withdrew, leaving them without counsel and\n\nunable to respond to the motion for sanctions.\n\n           Crispin filed a \"second motion for sanctions\" against\n\nMoyeno, Puerto Rico Police Officers Vanessa Carmona and Alfredo\n\nRivera-Suárez,    and   Carolina    Police     Commander,    Colonel    Carlos\n\nHaddock.     He   alleged   they   had   not   complied     with    outstanding\n\ndiscovery requests or produced Rule 26 disclosures.                Moyeno never\n\nfiled a response.\n\n           The district court ordered Crispin's counsel to file a\n\nlist of outstanding discovery owed to Crispin by each defendant,\n\nand Crispin did so two days later.\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\f           The district court then granted Crispin's second motion\n\nfor sanctions as to the other defendants, including Moyeno.            It\n\nstruck their pleadings and entered a default for their failure to\n\nprovide timely discovery.         The district court also denied the\n\nMunicipality’s motion for reconsideration of the default sanction.\n\n           3.   Trial\n\n           A jury trial on damages commenced in October 2009.\n\nBefore   and    during   trial,   the   Municipality   objected   to   the\n\nintroduction     of   evidence    concerning   Crispin's   psychological\n\ntreatment on the grounds that Crispin failed to provide all of his\n\nmedical records during discovery.         Despite Crispin's failure to\n\nprovide all of his medical records, the Municipality was able to\n\nacquire Crispin’s medical records by subpoena.\n\n           The district court did not allow Crispin to present any\n\nevidence that he did not provide to the Municipality.       On the other\n\nhand, the district court permitted the Municipality to use all of\n\nthe medical records that it had acquired on its own by subpoena.\n\n           The Municipality proposed a lengthy jury instruction on\n\ncausation, but the district court declined to give the proposed\n\ninstruction.    The jury rendered a verdict in favor of Crispin, and\n\nagainst the Municipality in the amount of $35,000, Moyeno in the\n\namount of $10,000, Cruz in the amount of $10,000, Peraza in the\n\n\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\famount of $10,000, and Díaz in the amount of $10,000.1   This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n                            II.   ANALYSIS\n\nA.   Service of Process\n\n            The individual defendants argue that they were never\n\nproperly served with process under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\n\n4(e) and (m) and, as a result, the judgment should be reversed.\n\nThe district court's decision regarding dismissal for insufficient\n\nservice of process is reviewed for abuse of discretion.          See\n\nPerez-Sanchez v. Pub. Bldg. Auth., 531 F.3d 104, 106 (1st Cir.\n\n2008).\n\n            Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(m), which governs the\n\ntiming of service, provides,\n\n                   If a defendant is not served within 120\n            days after the complaint is filed, the\n            court--on motion or on its own after notice to\n            the plaintiff--must dismiss the action without\n            prejudice against that defendant or order that\n            service be made within a specified time. But\n            if the plaintiff shows good cause for the\n            failure, the court must extend the time for\n            service for an appropriate period.\n\n            Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12 allows a party to file\n\na motion to dismiss for insufficient service of process.        This\n\nmotion \"must be made before pleading if a responsive pleading is\n\nallowed.\"    Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b).\n\n\n\n      1\n      The jury did not assess damages against Haddock, Carmona, and\nRivera-Suárez.\n\n                                  -10-\n\f              \"[A] party that makes a motion under [Rule 12] must not\n\nmake another motion under this rule raising a defense or objection\n\nthat was available to the party but omitted from its earlier\n\nmotion.\"      Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(g)(2).   Omitting a defense under these\n\ncircumstances results in waiver.          Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(1)(A);\n\nChute v. Walker, 281 F.3d 314, 319-20 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n              Moyeno filed a motion to dismiss for improper service\n\nunder Rule 4(m) on April 3, 2008, and Cruz, Díaz, and Peraza filed\n\na motion to join Moyeno’s motion on April 14, 2008.       These motions\n\nwere filed before their responsive pleadings and thus were timely.\n\n              In their motions, the individual defendants challenged\n\nthe timing of the service of process.          Crispin's complaint was\n\nfiled on October 25, 2007, and therefore service of process was due\n\non or before February 22, 2008.       See Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m).     The\n\nindividual defendants were not served until February 28 and 29,\n\n2008.       Thus, the individual defendants were served over 120 days\n\nafter the filing of the complaint in violation of Rule 4(m).\n\n              The problem for the individual defendants is that, when\n\nthey filed these initial motions, they admitted that they were\n\nserved and challenged only the timing of the service.2            (DE 8\n\n\n        2\n      Had the individual defendants not admitted they were served,\nthey might have prevailed because the service was improper.\nCrispin attempted to serve the individual defendants by delivering\na copy of the summons and complaint to an attorney in the\nMunicipality’s legal department.      This method of service was\neffective only as to the official-capacity claims, but it was not\neffective as to the individual-capacity claims. See Perez-Sanchez,\n\n                                   -11-\n\f(\"Ruben Mo[y]eno Cintron . . . w[as] served with summons on\n\nFebruary 29, 2008.\")); (DE 9 (\"On February 28, 2008, the appearing\n\ndefendants, [Cruz, Díaz, and Peraza], were served with summons and\n\na copy of the Amended Complaint . . ..\")).              A district court is not\n\nrequired to dismiss a defendant when service is not made within the\n\n120-day deadline.         See Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m).         The district court\n\nalso has the option to \"order that service be made within a\n\nspecified    time.\"       Id.      Given   that   the    individual    defendants\n\nadmitted in their motion to dismiss that they were served on\n\nFebruary 28 and 29, 2008, the district court's denial of the motion\n\nwas   effectively     a   ruling    that   service      could   be   performed   by\n\nFebruary 29, 2008.        This decision was within the district court’s\n\ndiscretion under Rule 4(m).\n\n            The individual defendants' later motion challenging the\n\nmethod of service does not help them.              This motion was filed on\n\nFebruary 19, 2009, almost a year after the alleged service of\n\nprocess.    By this time, it was too late.         The individual defendants\n\nhad already sought dismissal for improper service in April 2008.\n\nThey could have objected to the method of service at that time.\n\nTheir failure to do so means their objection to the method of\n\nservice was waived.        See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(g)(2); Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n12(h)(1)(A); SEC v. Beisinger Indus. Corp., 552 F.2d 15, 20 (1st\n\nCir. 1977) (holding that insufficient service defense was waived\n\n\n531 F.3d at 106.\n\n                                       -12-\n\fwhere the defendants' initial motion to dismiss alleged only that\n\nservice was impossible, not that service was improperly effectuated\n\nunder Rule 4).\n\nB.   Default\n\n            Appellants argue the record does not support the district\n\ncourt's imposition of a default judgment.         The district court's\n\nimposition of a default judgment as a sanction is reviewed for\n\nabuse of discretion.      Remexcel Managerial Consultants, Inc. v.\n\nArlequin, 583 F.3d 45, 51 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n            Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(b) gives the district\n\ncourt a \"veritable arsenal of sanctions\" for failure to comply with\n\ndiscovery   orders,   including   designating    facts   as   established,\n\nstriking pleadings, or rendering a default judgment.             Malot v.\n\nDorado Beach Cottages Assocs., 478 F.3d 40, 44 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\nAlthough a \"drastic sanction,\" \"[t]he entry of a default judgment\n\nprovides a useful remedy when a litigant is confronted by an\n\nobstructionist    adversary   and    plays   a   constructive    role   in\n\nmaintaining the orderly and efficient administration of justice.\"\n\nRemexcel Managerial Consultants, 583 F.3d at 51 (citations and\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted).\n\n            When faced with a motion for sanctions, the non-moving\n\nparty must file an opposition.      District of Puerto Rico Local Rule\n\n7(b) states, \"Unless within fourteen (14) days after the service of\n\na motion the opposing party files a written objection to the\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\fmotion, incorporating a memorandum of law, the opposing party shall\n\nbe deemed to have waived objection.\" A party’s failure, on account\n\nof ignorance or neglect, to timely oppose a motion in the district\n\ncourt constitutes forfeiture.        See Rivera-Torres v. Ortiz Velez,\n\n341 F.3d 86, 102 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n          The Municipality, Cruz, Díaz, and Peraza never filed a\n\nresponse to Crispin's June 11, 2009 motion for sanctions.           The\n\ndistrict court gave them until June 29, 2009, to file a response to\n\nthe motion.    Although the district court held the motion in\n\nabeyance on June 24, 2009, this did not relieve the parties of\n\ntheir obligation to respond.    Indeed, after the motion was held in\n\nabeyance, Crispin continued to file motions alleging the defendants\n\nwere not complying with discovery obligations.        When the district\n\ncourt defaulted the Municipality, Cruz, Díaz, and Peraza on July 8,\n\n2009, they had still not responded.      It was not until their motion\n\nfor   reconsideration   that   the     defendants   disputed   Crispin’s\n\nallegations.   A motion for reconsideration of a sanction order,\n\nhowever, cannot revive claims that were forfeited by failing to\n\ntimely oppose the original motion.        See Marks 3 Zet-Ernst Marks\n\nGmBh & Co. KG v. Presstek, Inc., 455 F.3d 7, 15 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\nAccordingly, the Municipality, Cruz, Díaz, and Peraza forfeited any\n\nobjection to Crispin’s motion for sanctions.3       See id.\n\n\n      3\n      There was at least a forfeiture here and therefore we will\nproceed under a forfeiture analysis. Given the local rule and the\nknowledge the parties had, they may have actually waived their\n\n                                 -14-\n\f           Similarly, Moyeno never responded to Crispin’s July 16,\n\n2009 motion for sanctions and therefore forfeited any objection to\n\nthe motion.      The district court gave Moyeno until August 3, 2009,\n\nto file a response. When the district court sanctioned Moyeno with\n\ndefault on August 11, 2009, Moyeno had not filed an opposition.\n\n           Because appellants forfeited their argument by failing to\n\nraise it in a timely manner, we review only for plain error.                 See\n\nRivera-Torres, 341 F.3d at 102. \"We apply the plain error doctrine\n\n'stringently'     in   civil    cases,\"    Gaydar     v.   Sociedad    Instituto\n\nGineco-Quirurgico y Planificacion Familiar, 345 F.3d 15, 23 (1st\n\nCir. 2003) (quoting Trull v. Volkswagen of Am., Inc., 320 F.3d 1,\n\n6 (1st Cir. 2002)), and we are not persuaded that this is \"one of\n\nthose rare occasions when the standard is met,\" Diaz-Fonseca v.\n\nPuerto Rico, 451 F.3d 13, 36 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n           By not filing responses, the defendants never informed\n\nthe   district    court   how     they    complied    with   their     discovery\n\nobligations.        Without     any    opposition,     Crispin's      assertions\n\nregarding the inadequacy of the defendants' responses could be\n\ncredited   by    the   district   court.      While    default   was    a   harsh\n\nsanction, it was brought on by appellants' persistent failure to\n\ncomply with the court's discovery orders and was preceded by the\n\ncourt's \"clear advance warning.\"           Goya Foods, Inc. v. Unanue, 233\n\nF.3d 38, 48 (1st Cir. 2000).          There was no abuse of discretion—let\n\n\nobjection.\n\n                                       -15-\n\falone plain error—in the district court’s decision to sanction\n\nappellants in this manner.         See Remexcel Managerial Consultants,\n\n583 F.3d at 51.\n\nC.   Psychological Testimony\n\n           Appellants argue that the district court should have\n\nexcluded testimony of Crispin's psychological treatment because\n\nCrispin   failed   to    provide   all   of    his   medical   records    during\n\ndiscovery.\n\n           \"We review the district court's decisions to admit or\n\nexclude evidence for abuse of discretion.\"                 United States v.\n\nJadlowe, 628 F.3d 1, 23 (1st Cir. 2010).              Federal Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 37(c)(1) states, \"If a party fails to provide information\n\nor identify a witness as required by Rule 26(a) or (e), the party\n\nis not allowed to use that information or witness to supply\n\nevidence on a motion, at a hearing, or at a trial, unless the\n\nfailure was substantially justified or is harmless.\"\n\n           Crispin      identified   his      treating   physicians      in   his\n\ndiscovery materials, and therefore Rule 37(c)(1) does not preclude\n\nthe admission of their testimony. Although Crispin did not provide\n\nall of his medical records during discovery, the admission of the\n\nevidence was harmless to the Municipality because it was able to\n\nobtain the records on its own using a subpoena and the district\n\ncourt did not allow Crispin to use any records that he failed to\n\nprovide to it.     Accordingly, there was no abuse of discretion in\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fthe    admission     of   evidence    regarding      Crispin's     psychological\n\ntreatment.\n\nD. Jury Instruction on Causation\n\n            Appellants argue that the district court's failure to\n\ngive the Municipality's proposed jury instruction on causation was\n\nreversible error.\n\n              “The    trial     court's   refusal     to   give    a   particular\n\ninstruction constitutes reversible error only if the requested\n\ninstruction was (1) correct as a matter of substantive law, (2) not\n\nsubstantially incorporated into the charge as rendered, and (3)\n\nintegral to an important point in the case.”               White v. N.H. Dep't\n\nof Corr., 221 F.3d 254, 263-64 (1st Cir. 2000) (quoting United\n\nStates v. DeStefano, 59 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1995)).\n\n            The Municipality's argument fails at prong two because\n\nthe jury was adequately instructed on causation.                   See id.     The\n\ndistrict court explained, \"Any award you may enter in this case\n\nmust   be   based    on   the     evidence    and   must   be    based   on    your\n\ndispassionate analysis of the extent of the injuries, if any,\n\nsustained by the plaintiff as a result of any defendant's wrongs,\n\nif any.\"     (emphasis added).        The district court also instructed\n\nthat damages must be found by a preponderance of the evidence and\n\nthat \"the mere fact that I am discussing the issue of damages\n\ndoesn't mean that you have to find damages.\"                  These instructions\n\nadequately    informed      the    jury      that   Crispin     must   prove   the\n\n\n                                       -17-\n\fdefendants' actions caused the damages and that damages should not\n\nbe presumed.   Thus, the district court did not err in refusing to\n\ngive the Municipality's requested instruction.\n\n          AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                               -18-\n\f",

Plaintiff-Appellee    Yonatta\n\nCrispin-Taveras (\"Crispin\") brought a civil rights action against\n\nDefendants-Appellants Municipality of Carolina (the \"Municipality\")\n\nand various Municipality police officers.               The district court\n\ndefaulted the defendants for discovery violations.             After a jury\n\ntrial on damages, the district court entered a judgment in favor of\n\nCrispin in the amount of $75,000.                The Municipality and the\n\nindividual officers now appeal, challenging the default sanction,\n\nthe   admission   of    psychological       treatment   evidence,   the   jury\n\ninstructions, and the sufficiency of service of process.             For the\n\nreasons stated below, we affirm.\n\n                                 I. BACKGROUND\n\nA.    Factual Background\n\n            During a baseball game between the Puerto Rico national\n\nteam and the Dominican Republic national team held at the Roberto\n\nClemente Stadium in Carolina, Puerto Rico, in 2007, a spectator\n\nknown as \"Oscar\" was celebrating in the aisles with a Dominican\n\nflag. The Carolina Municipal Police Department intervened in order\n\nto eject Oscar from the stadium.\n\n            Crispin, a U.S. Marine from the Dominican Republic, was\n\nat the game wearing a hat with the insignia of the Dominican flag.\n\nHe became involved in the confrontation and alleged that the police\n\nofficers violently grabbed and removed him from the stands, struck\n\nhim in the head with a metal baton, and then handcuffed and\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fdetained him in the stadium detention center.               He was eventually\n\ntransported to a hospital where he received stitches to close a\n\nwound to his head.\n\n             Both sides faced criminal charges.            Crispin was charged\n\nwith aggravated assault and destruction of property, but the\n\ncharges were dismissed.          Three of the officers, Lieutenant John\n\nCruz-González     (\"Cruz\"),    Sergeant      Luis   Díaz-Ruiz   (\"Díaz\"),   and\n\nOfficer Karimar Peraza-Delgado (\"Peraza\") were indicted on federal\n\ncivil rights violations, but were acquitted.\n\nB.   Procedural Background\n\n             On October 25, 2007, Crispin filed a civil rights action\n\nin the District of Puerto Rico against the Municipality, the mayor\n\nof   the    Municipality,     an   association      of   Municipality   police\n\nofficers, two Commonwealth of Puerto Rico police officers, and\n\nthree insurance companies.          He also named as defendants various\n\nindividual Municipality police officers, including Captain Rubén\n\nMoyeno     (\"Moyeno\"),   Cruz,     Peraza,    and   Díaz    (collectively   the\n\n\"individual defendants\").\n\n             1.   Service of Process\n\n             On April 3, 2008, Moyeno filed a motion to dismiss, and\n\nCruz, Díaz, and Peraza filed a motion to join it.                They alleged\n\nthey were served with the summons and complaint on February 28 and\n\n29, 2008, which was more than 120 days after the filing of the\n\ncomplaint in violation of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(m).\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fCrispin responded that dismissal was not required because there was\n\nno prejudice and Rule 4(m) allows the district court to direct\n\nservice by a specified time, which was now unnecessary because the\n\ndefendants were served.     The district court denied the motions.\n\n           The Municipality filed an answer on September 4, 2008,\n\nand the individual defendants filed an answer on September 26,\n\n2008.   The individual defendants later filed a motion to withdraw\n\ntheir answer because they alleged that Cruz, Díaz, and Peraza were\n\nincluded in the answer by \"human error.\"         The district court\n\ngranted the motion and allowed the withdrawal of their answer.\n\n           In February 2009, Peraza and Cruz filed a motion to\n\ndismiss for improper service.    They alleged that Crispin failed to\n\neffectuate personal service and failed to do so within the time\n\nafforded by Rule 4(m).      In opposition, Crispin argued that the\n\ndefendants did not challenge the method of service in their April\n\n2008 motion to dismiss.        He further argued that service was\n\nproperly executed upon an attorney in the Municipality’s legal\n\ndepartment.     The district court denied the motion.\n\n           2.    Discovery Disputes\n\n           In December 2008, Crispin filed a motion to compel,\n\nalleging that the individual defendants had failed to produce Rule\n\n26 disclosures or answer Crispin's interrogatories or requests for\n\nproduction.     The individual defendants opposed the motion, arguing\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fthat they were not aware of any unproduced documents. The district\n\ncourt denied Crispin's motion without prejudice.\n\n            After a stay of the case during the pendency of the\n\nfederal   criminal   proceedings,    the   district    court   conducted   a\n\nscheduling conference.      See Fed. R. Civ. P. 16.             During the\n\nconference, the district court ordered the defendants to answer all\n\npending written discovery requests within ten days and ordered\n\ndiscovery to be completed by June 30, 2009.           Moyeno sent his Rule\n\n26 initial disclosures to Crispin the day after the conference.\n\n            On June 11, 2009, Crispin filed a motion for sanctions\n\nagainst the Municipality, Cruz, Díaz, and Peraza, alleging they had\n\nfailed to provide Rule 26 disclosures or respond to discovery\n\nrequests.   The district court conducted a telephone conference on\n\nJune 24, 2009, and decided to hold the motion for sanctions in\n\nabeyance. Following the conference, the court issued the following\n\nruling:\n\n            Rule 26 Meeting Report due by 7/3/2009.     I\n            have noted the content of [Crispin's motion\n            for sanctions] and make reference to the\n            directions given by me during the telephone\n            conference held today.       If any of the\n            mentioned parties have failed to fully comply\n            with Rule 26 disclosures, then their last\n            clear chance for compliance is the date set\n            herein. Otherwise, sanctions will be imposed\n            including striking evidence not included in\n            Rule 26 disclosures. Be guided accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\f           On June 24, 2009, Crispin moved for entry of default\n\nagainst   Cruz,   Díaz,   and    Peraza     for    their   failure   to   file    a\n\nresponsive pleading.\n\n           Crispin also filed a motion on June 30, 2009, seeking\n\nadditional time for his expert report because Cruz, Díaz, and\n\nPeraza    never   answered      his   interrogatories       or   requests     for\n\nproduction of documents.        Another reason he sought additional time\n\nwas because the Municipality allegedly failed to comply with its\n\ncontinuing Rule 34 obligations.             See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26 & 34.\n\nDuring the depositions of the officers, Crispin learned that the\n\nMunicipality's    Internal      Affairs     Department     was   conducting      an\n\ninvestigation.      Crispin alleged that, besides a two-page sworn\n\nstatement by Díaz, the Municipality did not produce any documents\n\narising out of this investigation. The district court gave Crispin\n\nan extension to produce the expert report.\n\n           On July 4, 2009, Crispin filed a motion \"in compliance\n\nwith\" the district court's order holding Crispin's June 11, 2009\n\nmotion for sanctions in abeyance.                 Crispin requested numerous\n\nsanctions, including the imposition of a default judgment.\n\n           The defendants never filed an opposition to Crispin’s\n\nJune 11, 2009 motion for sanctions.          On July 8, 2009, the district\n\ncourt found the Municipality, Cruz, Díaz, and Peraza in default,\n\nconcluding:\n\n                    Having   examined  Defendants'   track\n           record    of   non-compliance  with   discovery\n\n                                      -7-\n\f           obligations, and considering the averments\n           contained in [Crispin's motions], the court\n           ORDERS as follows:\n\n                  Defendants Municipality of Carolina,\n           Karimar Peraza-Delgado, John Cruz-González,\n           and Luis Díaz-Ruiz will face sanctions for\n           their failure to comply with discovery\n           obligations. Plaintiff's factual allegations\n           are deemed admitted, Defendants' defenses and\n           pleadings are stricken, and a liability\n           default finding is made.\n\n           The Municipality filed a motion for reconsideration.              It\n\nalleged it sent initial Rule 26 disclosures and produced all\n\ndocuments in its possession.       In support, it attached a list of the\n\nexhibits it produced and a copy of its initial Rule 26 disclosures.\n\nCruz, Díaz, and Peraza joined and supplemented the Municipality's\n\nmotion.    They alleged that their default was not willful because\n\ntheir DOJ attorney withdrew, leaving them without counsel and\n\nunable to respond to the motion for sanctions.\n\n           Crispin filed a \"second motion for sanctions\" against\n\nMoyeno, Puerto Rico Police Officers Vanessa Carmona and Alfredo\n\nRivera-Suárez,    and   Carolina    Police     Commander,    Colonel    Carlos\n\nHaddock.     He   alleged   they   had   not   complied     with    outstanding\n\ndiscovery requests or produced Rule 26 disclosures.                Moyeno never\n\nfiled a response.\n\n           The district court ordered Crispin's counsel to file a\n\nlist of outstanding discovery owed to Crispin by each defendant,\n\nand Crispin did so two days later.\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\f           The district court then granted Crispin's second motion\n\nfor sanctions as to the other defendants, including Moyeno.            It\n\nstruck their pleadings and entered a default for their failure to\n\nprovide timely discovery.         The district court also denied the\n\nMunicipality’s motion for reconsideration of the default sanction.\n\n           3.   Trial\n\n           A jury trial on damages commenced in October 2009.\n\nBefore   and    during   trial,   the   Municipality   objected   to   the\n\nintroduction     of   evidence    concerning   Crispin's   psychological\n\ntreatment on the grounds that Crispin failed to provide all of his\n\nmedical records during discovery.         Despite Crispin's failure to\n\nprovide all of his medical records, the Municipality was able to\n\nacquire Crispin’s medical records by subpoena.\n\n           The district court did not allow Crispin to present any\n\nevidence that he did not provide to the Municipality.       On the other\n\nhand, the district court permitted the Municipality to use all of\n\nthe medical records that it had acquired on its own by subpoena.\n\n           The Municipality proposed a lengthy jury instruction on\n\ncausation, but the district court declined to give the proposed\n\ninstruction.    The jury rendered a verdict in favor of Crispin, and\n\nagainst the Municipality in the amount of $35,000, Moyeno in the\n\namount of $10,000, Cruz in the amount of $10,000, Peraza in the\n\n\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\famount of $10,000, and Díaz in the amount of $10,000.1   This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n                            II.   ANALYSIS\n\nA.   Service of Process\n\n            The individual defendants argue that they were never\n\nproperly served with process under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\n\n4(e) and (m) and, as a result, the judgment should be reversed.\n\nThe district court's decision regarding dismissal for insufficient\n\nservice of process is reviewed for abuse of discretion.

These motions\n\nwere filed before their responsive pleadings and thus were timely.\n\n              In their motions, the individual defendants challenged\n\nthe timing of the service of process.          Crispin's complaint was\n\nfiled on October 25, 2007, and therefore service of process was due\n\non or before February 22, 2008.       See Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m).     The\n\nindividual defendants were not served until February 28 and 29,\n\n2008.       Thus, the individual defendants were served over 120 days\n\nafter the filing of the complaint in violation of Rule 4(m).\n\n              The problem for the individual defendants is that, when\n\nthey filed these initial motions, they admitted that they were\n\nserved and challenged only the timing of the service.2            (DE 8\n\n\n        2\n      Had the individual defendants not admitted they were served,\nthey might have prevailed because the service was improper.\nCrispin attempted to serve the individual defendants by delivering\na copy of the summons and complaint to an attorney in the\nMunicipality’s legal department.      This method of service was\neffective only as to the official-capacity claims, but it was not\neffective as to the individual-capacity claims. See Perez-Sanchez,\n\n                                   -11-\n\f(\"Ruben Mo[y]eno Cintron . . . w[as] served with summons on\n\nFebruary 29, 2008.\")); (DE 9 (\"On February 28, 2008, the appearing\n\ndefendants, [Cruz, Díaz, and Peraza], were served with summons and\n\na copy of the Amended Complaint . . ..\")).              A district court is not\n\nrequired to dismiss a defendant when service is not made within the\n\n120-day deadline.         See Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m).         The district court\n\nalso has the option to \"order that service be made within a\n\nspecified    time.\"       Id.      Given   that   the    individual    defendants\n\nadmitted in their motion to dismiss that they were served on\n\nFebruary 28 and 29, 2008, the district court's denial of the motion\n\nwas   effectively     a   ruling    that   service      could   be   performed   by\n\nFebruary 29, 2008.        This decision was within the district court’s\n\ndiscretion under Rule 4(m).\n\n            The individual defendants' later motion challenging the\n\nmethod of service does not help them.              This motion was filed on\n\nFebruary 19, 2009, almost a year after the alleged service of\n\nprocess.    By this time, it was too late.         The individual defendants\n\nhad already sought dismissal for improper service in April 2008.\n\nThey could have objected to the method of service at that time.\n\nTheir failure to do so means their objection to the method of\n\nservice was waived.

The\n\ndistrict court gave them until June 29, 2009, to file a response to\n\nthe motion.    Although the district court held the motion in\n\nabeyance on June 24, 2009, this did not relieve the parties of\n\ntheir obligation to respond.    Indeed, after the motion was held in\n\nabeyance, Crispin continued to file motions alleging the defendants\n\nwere not complying with discovery obligations.        When the district\n\ncourt defaulted the Municipality, Cruz, Díaz, and Peraza on July 8,\n\n2009, they had still not responded.      It was not until their motion\n\nfor   reconsideration   that   the     defendants   disputed   Crispin’s\n\nallegations.

Although Crispin did not provide\n\nall of his medical records during discovery, the admission of the\n\nevidence was harmless to the Municipality because it was able to\n\nobtain the records on its own using a subpoena and the district\n\ncourt did not allow Crispin to use any records that he failed to\n\nprovide to it.
