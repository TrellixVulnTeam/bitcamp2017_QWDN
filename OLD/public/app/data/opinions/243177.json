Upon the expiration of the five year period no claims or bonds should participate in the distribution and all securities and cash remaining unclaimed would become the property of Morrison Hotel Corporation as the equitable owner of all the property of the Hartford Liquidation Trust with the court reserving jurisdiction as provided in its decree of May 19, 1948.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">May 27, 1956 was on a Sunday and it can not be questioned that, under Rule 6(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A., the five year period continued through Monday, May 28, 1956.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts, established by the evidence, viewed in its aspects most favorable to the petitioner-appellee, are that Louella Chapin, who in 1955 was over 90 years of age, was the owner of two units of beneficial interest in the Hartford Building Corporation having a value of 1,181.70.

Hannah then told Gorman he would send to him certain forms to be filled out and that upon their execution and return with his power of attorney it would be sufficient and the Bank would be able to pay out the money.  Shortly thereafter a messenger appeared with the forms which Gorman filled out, attaching thereto a photostatic copy of his power of attorney, and sent it back to the Bank.  Late in the afternoon of that same day Gorman received a telephone call from Mr. Bedingfield of the Continental Illinois National Bank informing Gorman that Mr. Rubin was insisting that the units themselves be presented.  At Gorman's request he was switched to Mr. Kimball of the Bank and Gorman told Kimball he would prepare an indemnifying bond or any other type of paper which would hold the Bank harmless or in fact anything the Bank or Mr. Rubin would require but that the units were in the vault and it would be impossible to get them until Miss Chapin recovered.
