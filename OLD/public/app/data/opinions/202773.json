Metallic on brief pro se.\n     Eileen J. O'Connor, Assistant Attorney General, Thomas J.\nClark and Marion E.M. Erickson, Attorneys, Tax Division, Department\nof Justice on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                              May 31, 2007\n\f            Per Curiam.   Appellant Joseph Metallic appeals from an\n\nadverse United States Tax Court decision.     We affirm.\n\n            In his tax petition, Metallic claimed he did not have to\n\npay federal income tax because he is a Micmac Indian and a 1776\n\ntreaty with his tribe did not require the payment of taxes.   In its\n\nMemorandum Opinion filed on June 13, 2006, the Tax Court correctly\n\nrejected that claim, citing pertinent authorities.    It pointed out\n\nthat Native Americans, like \"other U.S. citizens,\" are obliged to\n\npay federal income taxes, and that while treaties might exempt them\n\nfrom taxation, the 1776 treaty did not do so.\n\n            On appeal, Metallic objects to the Tax Court's suggestion\n\nthat he is a United States citizen, alleging that he is a member of\n\na Canadian Micmac tribe.     Even if the facts are as he says, no\n\nprejudicial error by the Tax Court has been shown.          Metallic\n\nacknowledges that he resides in this country, and so the tax laws\n\napply to him even if he is not a citizen.     See, e.g., 26 C.F.R. ยง\n\n1.1-1(a)(1) (noting that the tax code imposes a tax on the income\n\nof \"every individual who is a citizen or resident of the United\n\nStates\").\n\n            We have considered Metallic's remaining claims, but find\n\nthem meritless.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\f",
