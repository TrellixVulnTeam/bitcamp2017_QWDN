The Board of Immigration Appeals\n\n(BIA) ordered Jean Rony Bernadin, a Haitian, deported after he was\n\nconvicted of domestic violence (Family Abuse-Assault and Battery)\n\nagainst the mother of one of his children.                       In doing so, it\n\nreversed a grant of asylum by the Immigration Judge (IJ).\n\n              Bernadin now attempts to appeal from the BIA's final\n\norder denying asylum.         That he may not do; he took no timely action\n\nto seek review from that order.             See Stone v. INS, 514 U.S. 386,\n\n405-06 (1995).      His petition is timely only from the BIA's later\n\ndecision denying      his     motion   to      reconsider,      and    we    treat   his\n\npetition as a challenge to the denial of reconsideration.                            Our\n\nreview   of    denials   of    motions    to    reconsider      is     for   abuse    of\n\ndiscretion,     Zhang v. INS, 348 F.3d 289, 293 (1st Cir. 2003); there\n\nwas no abuse of discretion here.\n\n                                         I.\n\n              Bernadin entered the United States as a lawful permanent\n\nresident on or about April 22, 1993.                 Following his conviction in\n\nMassachusetts for Family Abuse-Assault and Battery, Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nch. 265, § 13(A), the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)\n\nissued him a Notice to Appear on August 3, 1998, charging Bernadin\n\nas   being        removable       from         the     United         States     under\n\n§ 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.1                          8\n\n\n     1\n          At the time, Bernadin actually had three convictions for\nFamily Abuse-Assault and Battery. However, because two of them\nwere on direct appeal and thus not final judgments, the INS based\n\n                                         -2-\n\fU.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). This section allows for removal of an\n\nalien convicted after entry of an aggravated felony, defined in the\n\nAct, § 101(a)(43)(F), as a crime of violence for which the term of\n\nimprisonment imposed is at least one year.                             Id.; 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1101(a)(43)(F).      As Bernadin received time served of less than one\n\nyear    for   his   conviction,     the    INS     withdrew        its     Notice      under\n\n§      237(a)(2)(A)(iii),       and       issued     a           new      Notice       under\n\n§ 237(a)(2)(E)(i), which allows for removal of an alien who has\n\nbeen    convicted    of,    among   other    things,         a    crime     of     domestic\n\nviolence, regardless of the length of sentence.                             8 U.S.C. §\n\n1227(a)(2)(E)(i).\n\n              Bernadin     sought   asylum   under       §       208(b)    of    the   Act,\n\nclaiming both that he had suffered from past persecution in Haiti\n\nas a result of a cousin's association with the Ton Ton Macoutes and\n\nthat he had a well-founded fear of future persecution should he be\n\ndeported.      The IJ granted his asylum claim, finding that although\n\nBernadin's past treatment did not rise to the level of past\n\npersecution, Bernadin nonetheless did possess a well-founded fear\n\nof future persecution should he return to Haiti.                        A combination of\n\nfactors led the IJ to that decision.               The IJ first noted that, as\n\na criminal deportee, there was a high probability that Bernadin\n\nwould be jailed immediately on return to Haiti.                        This probability,\n\n\nits Notice to Appear solely on the one final judgment. Bernadin\nhas noted that this judgment is the subject of a collateral attack.\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fthe judge explained,         together with Bernadin's lack of family to\n\nassist in getting him out of jail and his family's previous\n\npolitical associations, meant that Bernadin might be left in jail\n\nindefinitely, or worse.\n\n              The INS appealed this decision to the BIA, arguing that\n\nBernadin      did     not   establish    a     well-founded   fear   of   future\n\npersecution as a matter of law.           Bernadin did not respond.       On May\n\n28, 2003, the BIA overturned the ruling of the IJ, agreeing with\n\nthe   INS     that    Bernadin   had    no     well-founded   fear   of   future\n\npersecution.         Specifically, the BIA found:\n\n              The respondent claims he would be tortured or killed in\n              Haiti. We find that the evidence does not indicate that\n              he has a well-founded fear or that it is more likely than\n              not that the respondent would be harmed for one of the\n              protected reasons. The respondent also does not meet the\n              requirement that the government would acquiesce in his\n              intentional mistreatment. The respondent did not support\n              his assertion that he was arrested because of his family\n              ties, rather than for some other reason. The Department\n              of State, Profile of Asylum Claims and Country Conditions\n              - Haiti, March 31, 1998, . . . does not support a\n              conclusion that former associates of the Macoutes are\n              persecuted.    After so long a period of time, the\n              possibility that someone would seek the respondent out\n              for harm seems remote.     Such an act would also be a\n              personal vendetta, not persecution.\n\n              The BIA also examined the claim that criminal returnees\n\nto    Haiti    are     imprisoned      under    conditions    that   amount   to\n\npersecution:\n\n              The Immigration Judge found that criminal returnees to\n              Haiti are imprisoned under conditions which amount to\n              persecution.   We do not disagree that the respondent\n              faces at least a possibility of imprisonment upon return\n              to his country. While the treatment in prison may be\n\n                                                -4-\n\f            harsh, these conditions are universal in Haitian prisons\n            and are not directed at the returnees. Moreover, the\n            returnees may be released upon review of their cases.\n            There has been no evidence presented which makes a case\n            that the respondent has a well-founded fear or will more\n            likely than not be intentionally subjected to persecution\n            or torture.    The possibility that the respondent may\n            suffer under these poor prison conditions is not\n            sufficient to substantiate a finding that the Haitian\n            government acquiesces in the \"torture\" of criminal\n            deportees who are detained, as that term is defined by\n            regulation. As a result, we find that the evidence fails\n            to establish a well founded fear of persecution or that\n            the respondent will more likely than not be subjected to\n            treatment rising to the level of torture in Haiti as a\n            result of his status as a criminal detainee.\n            (citations omitted)\n\n            Bernadin did not seek timely judicial review of the BIA's\n\ndecision.\n\n            On    June   27,   2003,    he   instead   filed   a   motion   to\n\nreconsider, which was denied by the BIA on August 29, 2003.                 In\n\ndenying the motion, the BIA stated that Bernadin's motion \"fails to\n\npersuade us of any error of fact or law in our last decision which\n\nwould    affect   the    result   in   his   case.\"    Bernadin    thereafter\n\npetitioned this court for review.              We construe the petition,\n\ndespite its arguments addressed only to the BIA's initial denial of\n\nasylum, to be from the denial of the motion to reconsider.2\n\n\n\n\n     2\n          We are concerned that counsel for Bernadin failed to\ninform us of the untimeliness of the petition vis-á-vis the BIA's\ninitial asylum decision and of the later denial of the motion for\nreconsideration. At the least, counsel has woefully failed to meet\nhis duty of candor to the court. See Mass. R. of Prof'l Conduct\n3.3. We expect that such conduct will not recur.\n\n                                       -5-\n\f                                          II.\n\n              In    petitioning    the    BIA     to   reconsider     a   decision,\n\nrespondent's motion \"shall state the reasons for the motion by\n\nspecifying the errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision\n\nand   shall    be    supported    by     pertinent      authority.\"       8   C.F.R.\n\n§ 1003.2(b)(1).          This is distinguished from a motion to reopen,\n\nwhich requires the petitioner to provide new evidence that \"is\n\nmaterial and was not available and could not have been discovered\n\nor presented at the former hearing.\"                   8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1).\n\nThus, one petitioning for a motion to reconsider need not present\n\nnew law or facts that would materially alter the previous decision,\n\nbut must point to errors of fact or law by the BIA in its previous\n\ndecision.\n\n              In his motion to reconsider, Bernadin claimed that the\n\nBIA   committed      a    legal   error    by    determining   that       there   was\n\ninsufficient evidence of a well-founded fear of persecution without\n\nholding that the IJ's finding as to Bernadin's credibility was\n\nclearly erroneous.         His asylum claim had two prongs.               First, he\n\nclaimed that as a criminal deportee, he will be placed in prison\n\nunder conditions that amount to torture upon returning to Haiti.\n\nSecond, he claimed that, due to his cousin's past relationship with\n\nthe Ton Ton Macoutes, he will upon returning to Haiti be persecuted\n\nfor his political affiliation.                  In the motion to reconsider,\n\nBernadin argued that, because the IJ found him to be credible and\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fhe testified that both of the above were true, to find that he did\n\nnot have a well-founded fear of persecution would require that the\n\nBIA find the IJ's credibility determination clearly erroneous,\n\nwhich the BIA did not do.       See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i).\n\n          This claim is mistaken. The BIA's decision on Bernadin's\n\nfirst argument -- that as a criminal deportee he will be placed in\n\nprison under conditions that amount to torture -- rested on two\n\ngrounds that are independent of the credibility of Bernadin's\n\ntestimony; namely, the state of prison conditions in Haiti (a fact\n\nissue), and the question whether Bernadin's placement in those\n\nconditions as a criminal deportee rises to the level of torture as\n\ndefined by the Act (a legal issue that the BIA reviews de novo).\n\nIt was well within the discretion of the BIA not to reconsider its\n\nfinding that \"[t]he possibility that the respondent may suffer\n\nunder   these   poor   prison     conditions   is   not   sufficient   to\n\nsubstantiate a finding that the Haitian government acquiesces in\n\nthe 'torture' of criminal deportees who are detained, as that term\n\nis defined by regulation.\"\n\n          The BIA's decision denying Bernadin's second argument --\n\nthat he has a well-founded fear of persecution based on his\n\nfamily's past political associations -- also rested on two grounds\n\nindependent of the credibility of his testimony: first, what\n\nBernadin's likely treatment will be upon returning to Haiti due to\n\nhis past association with a family member involved with the Ton Ton\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fMacoutes, and second, whether that treatment rises to the level of\n\npersecution as a matter of law as defined by the Act.            The first\n\nground may rest in part on Bernadin's testimony, but much of it\n\ndepends on the general treatment in Haiti of those who were\n\ninvolved with the Ton Ton Macoutes in the past, which is a fact\n\nissue independent of Bernadin's credibility.        The second ground is\n\na question of law for the BIA to consider de novo -- another issue\n\non which the credibility of Bernadin's testimony simply has no\n\nbearing. In making the decision not to reconsider its finding that\n\nthe evidence did not rise to the level of a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture   persecution,   the   BIA    was   well   within   its   scope   of\n\ndiscretion.\n\n           In essence, Bernadin's argument is that the BIA had to\n\naccept the IJ's finding that his testimony was credible, and that\n\nif his testimony was credible, then his claim of future persecution\n\nmust be allowed.   But that is not so.     The BIA had ample reasons to\n\ndeny the motion to reconsider its initial decision, which rested on\n\ngrounds that did not depend on Bernadin's credibility.            The BIA\n\ncommitted no error of law or fact nor did it inexplicably depart\n\nfrom precedent so as to render its decision an abuse of discretion.\n\n           We affirm the BIA and deny the petition for review.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\f",

As Bernadin received time served of less than one\n\nyear    for   his   conviction,     the    INS     withdrew        its     Notice      under\n\n§      237(a)(2)(A)(iii),       and       issued     a           new      Notice       under\n\n§ 237(a)(2)(E)(i), which allows for removal of an alien who has\n\nbeen    convicted    of,    among   other    things,         a    crime     of     domestic\n\nviolence, regardless of the length of sentence.                             8 U.S.C. §\n\n1227(a)(2)(E)(i).\n\n              Bernadin     sought   asylum   under       §       208(b)    of    the   Act,\n\nclaiming both that he had suffered from past persecution in Haiti\n\nas a result of a cousin's association with the Ton Ton Macoutes and\n\nthat he had a well-founded fear of future persecution should he be\n\ndeported.      The IJ granted his asylum claim, finding that although\n\nBernadin's past treatment did not rise to the level of past\n\npersecution, Bernadin nonetheless did possess a well-founded fear\n\nof future persecution should he return to Haiti.                        A combination of\n\nfactors led the IJ to that decision.               The IJ first noted that, as\n\na criminal deportee, there was a high probability that Bernadin\n\nwould be jailed immediately on return to Haiti.                        This probability,\n\n\nits Notice to Appear solely on the one final judgment. Bernadin\nhas noted that this judgment is the subject of a collateral attack.\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fthe judge explained,         together with Bernadin's lack of family to\n\nassist in getting him out of jail and his family's previous\n\npolitical associations, meant that Bernadin might be left in jail\n\nindefinitely, or worse.\n\n              The INS appealed this decision to the BIA, arguing that\n\nBernadin      did     not   establish    a     well-founded   fear   of   future\n\npersecution as a matter of law.           Bernadin did not respond.       On May\n\n28, 2003, the BIA overturned the ruling of the IJ, agreeing with\n\nthe   INS     that    Bernadin   had    no     well-founded   fear   of   future\n\npersecution.         Specifically, the BIA found:\n\n              The respondent claims he would be tortured or killed in\n              Haiti. We find that the evidence does not indicate that\n              he has a well-founded fear or that it is more likely than\n              not that the respondent would be harmed for one of the\n              protected reasons. The respondent also does not meet the\n              requirement that the government would acquiesce in his\n              intentional mistreatment. The respondent did not support\n              his assertion that he was arrested because of his family\n              ties, rather than for some other reason. The Department\n              of State, Profile of Asylum Claims and Country Conditions\n              - Haiti, March 31, 1998, . . . does not support a\n              conclusion that former associates of the Macoutes are\n              persecuted.    After so long a period of time, the\n              possibility that someone would seek the respondent out\n              for harm seems remote.     Such an act would also be a\n              personal vendetta, not persecution.\n\n              The BIA also examined the claim that criminal returnees\n\nto    Haiti    are     imprisoned      under    conditions    that   amount   to\n\npersecution:\n\n              The Immigration Judge found that criminal returnees to\n              Haiti are imprisoned under conditions which amount to\n              persecution.   We do not disagree that the respondent\n              faces at least a possibility of imprisonment upon return\n              to his country. While the treatment in prison may be\n\n                                                -4-\n\f            harsh, these conditions are universal in Haitian prisons\n            and are not directed at the returnees. Moreover, the\n            returnees may be released upon review of their cases.\n            There has been no evidence presented which makes a case\n            that the respondent has a well-founded fear or will more\n            likely than not be intentionally subjected to persecution\n            or torture.    The possibility that the respondent may\n            suffer under these poor prison conditions is not\n            sufficient to substantiate a finding that the Haitian\n            government acquiesces in the \"torture\" of criminal\n            deportees who are detained, as that term is defined by\n            regulation. As a result, we find that the evidence fails\n            to establish a well founded fear of persecution or that\n            the respondent will more likely than not be subjected to\n            treatment rising to the level of torture in Haiti as a\n            result of his status as a criminal detainee.\n            (citations omitted)\n\n            Bernadin did not seek timely judicial review of the BIA's\n\ndecision.\n\n            On    June   27,   2003,    he   instead   filed   a   motion   to\n\nreconsider, which was denied by the BIA on August 29, 2003.                 In\n\ndenying the motion, the BIA stated that Bernadin's motion \"fails to\n\npersuade us of any error of fact or law in our last decision which\n\nwould    affect   the    result   in   his   case.\"    Bernadin    thereafter\n\npetitioned this court for review.              We construe the petition,\n\ndespite its arguments addressed only to the BIA's initial denial of\n\nasylum, to be from the denial of the motion to reconsider.2\n\n\n\n\n     2\n          We are concerned that counsel for Bernadin failed to\ninform us of the untimeliness of the petition vis-á-vis the BIA's\ninitial asylum decision and of the later denial of the motion for\nreconsideration. At the least, counsel has woefully failed to meet\nhis duty of candor to the court. See Mass. R. of Prof'l Conduct\n3.3. We expect that such conduct will not recur.\n\n                                       -5-\n\f                                          II.\n\n              In    petitioning    the    BIA     to   reconsider     a   decision,\n\nrespondent's motion \"shall state the reasons for the motion by\n\nspecifying the errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision\n\nand   shall    be    supported    by     pertinent      authority.\"       8   C.F.R.\n\n§ 1003.2(b)(1).          This is distinguished from a motion to reopen,\n\nwhich requires the petitioner to provide new evidence that \"is\n\nmaterial and was not available and could not have been discovered\n\nor presented at the former hearing.\"                   8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1).\n\nThus, one petitioning for a motion to reconsider need not present\n\nnew law or facts that would materially alter the previous decision,\n\nbut must point to errors of fact or law by the BIA in its previous\n\ndecision.\n\n              In his motion to reconsider, Bernadin claimed that the\n\nBIA   committed      a    legal   error    by    determining   that       there   was\n\ninsufficient evidence of a well-founded fear of persecution without\n\nholding that the IJ's finding as to Bernadin's credibility was\n\nclearly erroneous.         His asylum claim had two prongs.               First, he\n\nclaimed that as a criminal deportee, he will be placed in prison\n\nunder conditions that amount to torture upon returning to Haiti.\n\nSecond, he claimed that, due to his cousin's past relationship with\n\nthe Ton Ton Macoutes, he will upon returning to Haiti be persecuted\n\nfor his political affiliation.                  In the motion to reconsider,\n\nBernadin argued that, because the IJ found him to be credible and\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fhe testified that both of the above were true, to find that he did\n\nnot have a well-founded fear of persecution would require that the\n\nBIA find the IJ's credibility determination clearly erroneous,\n\nwhich the BIA did not do.       See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i).\n\n          This claim is mistaken. The BIA's decision on Bernadin's\n\nfirst argument -- that as a criminal deportee he will be placed in\n\nprison under conditions that amount to torture -- rested on two\n\ngrounds that are independent of the credibility of Bernadin's\n\ntestimony; namely, the state of prison conditions in Haiti (a fact\n\nissue), and the question whether Bernadin's placement in those\n\nconditions as a criminal deportee rises to the level of torture as\n\ndefined by the Act (a legal issue that the BIA reviews de novo).\n\nIt was well within the discretion of the BIA not to reconsider its\n\nfinding that \"[t]he possibility that the respondent may suffer\n\nunder   these   poor   prison     conditions   is   not   sufficient   to\n\nsubstantiate a finding that the Haitian government acquiesces in\n\nthe 'torture' of criminal deportees who are detained, as that term\n\nis defined by regulation.\"\n\n          The BIA's decision denying Bernadin's second argument --\n\nthat he has a well-founded fear of persecution based on his\n\nfamily's past political associations -- also rested on two grounds\n\nindependent of the credibility of his testimony: first, what\n\nBernadin's likely treatment will be upon returning to Haiti due to\n\nhis past association with a family member involved with the Ton Ton\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fMacoutes, and second, whether that treatment rises to the level of\n\npersecution as a matter of law as defined by the Act.            The first\n\nground may rest in part on Bernadin's testimony, but much of it\n\ndepends on the general treatment in Haiti of those who were\n\ninvolved with the Ton Ton Macoutes in the past, which is a fact\n\nissue independent of Bernadin's credibility.        The second ground is\n\na question of law for the BIA to consider de novo -- another issue\n\non which the credibility of Bernadin's testimony simply has no\n\nbearing. In making the decision not to reconsider its finding that\n\nthe evidence did not rise to the level of a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture   persecution,   the   BIA    was   well   within   its   scope   of\n\ndiscretion.\n\n           In essence, Bernadin's argument is that the BIA had to\n\naccept the IJ's finding that his testimony was credible, and that\n\nif his testimony was credible, then his claim of future persecution\n\nmust be allowed.   But that is not so.     The BIA had ample reasons to\n\ndeny the motion to reconsider its initial decision, which rested on\n\ngrounds that did not depend on Bernadin's credibility.            The BIA\n\ncommitted no error of law or fact nor did it inexplicably depart\n\nfrom precedent so as to render its decision an abuse of discretion.\n\n           We affirm the BIA and deny the petition for review.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\f</pre>",
