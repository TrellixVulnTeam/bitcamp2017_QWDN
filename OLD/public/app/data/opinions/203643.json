Michelle Monteagudo brought\n\nsuit alleging sexual harassment claims under federal and Puerto\n\nRico law against her former employer, Asociación de Empleados del\n\nEstado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico (\"AEELA\"),1 in the United\n\nStates District Court for the District of Puerto Rico.                On June 1,\n\n2007,   a   jury    found   that    Monteagudo     was   subjected    to     sexual\n\nharassment in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and\n\nPuerto Rico Laws 17, 69, and 100, and awarded her compensatory and\n\npunitive damages.       AEELA moved for judgment as a matter of law on\n\nthe Faragher-Ellerth affirmative defense pursuant to Federal Rule\n\nof Civil Procedure 50 and also moved for a new trial and remittitur\n\nof the damages award pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n59.     AEELA appeals the district court's denial of both these\n\nmotions as well as certain evidentiary and discovery rulings made\n\nduring trial.       After careful consideration, we affirm.\n\n                               I.     Background\n\n            A.     Monteagudo's Experience at AEELA\n\n            Monteagudo      started    working     at    AEELA   in   1999    as   a\n\nsecretary in the Human Resources department. At that time, she was\n\na non-permanent employee, substituting for the permanent secretary\n\nwho was out on maternity leave.         Monteagudo was supervised by Juan\n\nFrancisco Arce-Díaz (\"Arce\"), a payroll, fringe benefits, and\n\ncompensation manager for AEELA.              At trial, Monteagudo testified\n\n\n1\n    AEELA is a non-profit savings and loans organization.\n\n                                       -2-\n\fthat during her time as a substitute, Arce \"would look at [her] as\n\nif he was appraising [her].\"     However, she \"didn't give it much\n\nimportance\" because she did not view Arce's conduct to be that\n\nserious.\n\n           Monteagudo testified that Arce's conduct continued until\n\nArce's permanent secretary returned from maternity leave, at which\n\npoint Monteagudo stopped working in the Human Resources department.\n\nOn October 2, 2000, after stints in AEELA's legal collections and\n\nlegal affairs divisions, Monteagudo returned to the Human Resources\n\ndepartment as a permanent employee. Once there, Monteagudo claimed\n\nthat Arce engaged in inappropriate conduct towards her.             For\n\nexample, she remarked that Arce would come to her work station at\n\nleast once a day where \"he would stop and touch [her] on the\n\nshoulder.\"   Monteagudo stated that she resisted Arce's advances by\n\n\"throw[ing] his hand backwards so he'd leave [her] alone.\"          She\n\nalso complained that Arce would \"invit[e] [her] constantly to go\n\nout together\" with co-workers on double dates.\n\n           Monteagudo testified to the unpleasantness she felt as a\n\nresult of Arce's conduct: \"How can I feel except bad?         They were\n\ntreating me like a piece of meat.         I wouldn't like to go to work\n\n. . . I didn't like to go into the office, because I knew what I\n\nwould be involved and engaged in every day there.\"\n\n           On   one   such   day,     José    Francisco   Figueroa-Cana\n\n(\"Figueroa\"), a messenger for AEELA since 1996, witnessed Arce\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f\"plac[ing] his hand on [Monteagudo's] hip\" in \"an undesirable\n\naction.\" When he discussed this incident with Monteagudo, she told\n\nhim that \"that was something that normally took place . . . that\n\n[Arce] would always try to seek a way so he could touch her.\"\n\nFigueroa testified that he was uncertain about what recourse\n\nMonteagudo   should    take   because     this   was   a   matter    that   was\n\n\"extremely difficult and quite delicate\" given the people involved.\n\nEven though Figueroa was a union delegate, he decided against\n\nbringing the matter up to the union president because \"it was\n\nextremely difficult to bring forth something like this dealing with\n\nwho we dealt with,\" the union was a \"very weak institution within\n\nAEELA,\"   and   because   the     union    president       had   a   \"friendly\n\nrelationship\"   with    Orlando     Vargas-López       (\"Vargas\"),    AEELA's\n\nDirector of Human Resources and Labor Relations.\n\n          Monteagudo,     perhaps       partly   as    a    result    of    her\n\nconversation with Figueroa, did not report Arce's conduct to her\n\nsuperiors as required by AEELA's sexual harassment policy.2                 This\n\npolicy was in effect and distributed to Monteagudo while she was a\n\n\n2\n   Two provisions of AEELA's sexual harassment policy are relevant\nto this appeal. Section 3.2 of the policy states: \"An employee who\nfeels he has been sexually harassed at work in any way, should\npresent his complaint to the Human Resources Department. If the\nalleged harasser should be this person, or anyone related or close\nto him, then the complaint must be presented directly to the\nAssociation's Executive Director.\"     Section 3.3 of the policy\nstates: \"It is the responsibility of any employee who witnesses a\nsexual harassment act, or if any other employee has complained of\nbeing a victim of sexual harassment, to immediately inform the\nappropriate official.\"\n\n                                    -4-\n\fpermanent employee.     At trial, Monteagudo explained that she did\n\nnot report the sexual harassment \"[b]ecause the person I needed to\n\ncomplain with were all friends.\"         She added: \"Either it be the\n\nexecutive director or the human resources director, they're all\n\nfriends amongst themselves.      We're talking about some managerials\n\n[sic] versus an employee who virtually had started working a few\n\ndays before.\"      She claimed that the Executive Director, Pablo\n\nCrespo-Claudio     (\"Crespo\"),   was   friends   with   Vargas    and   Arce\n\n\"[b]ecause of conversations held by Orlando Vargas and Francisco\n\nArce themselves,\" noting that \"I tend to understand that if some\n\npeople go out together to drink liquor, they're friends who go out\n\nto be together.\"    Crespo admitted in his testimony that he may have\n\ngone out for drinks with Vargas and Arce.\n\n          Monteagudo testified that Arce's inappropriate behavior\n\ntowards her continued for several months leading up to an incident\n\nduring a group outing to a local bar, where in the parking lot,\n\nArce \"pulled [her] towards him to try to kiss [her].\"            Monteagudo\n\npushed him away that evening, but testified that when she returned\n\nto work the following Monday after the incident \"the attitude\n\ndisplayed towards [her] by Mr. Vargas and Mr. Arce\" was \"different\"\n\nand that the additional work given to her was excessive.                Also,\n\nwhen she complained to Vargas that she was performing two positions\n\nsimultaneously, in addition to assisting colleagues from other\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fdivisions, Vargas \"slammed the desk very hard and told [her] that\n\nif [she] filed a complaint, the next day [she] would be dismissed.\"\n\n            At trial, Monteagudo described her work conditions as\n\nintolerable due to the fact that her superiors did not permit\n\n\"anyone at all to stop over to talk to [her], even to just say good\n\nmorning.\"        Further, she explained the emotional toll AEELA's\n\nactions took on her: \"[E]very evening I'd be crying, I would leave\n\nwork crying, because there was a constant scolding for everything,\n\neverything I did was wrong.          Everything.\"   Thus, Monteagudo stated\n\nthat she was left with no choice but to resign, resulting in what\n\nthe jury later found to be a constructive discharge: \"Obviously, if\n\nsomebody is putting so much pressure on you and threatening to kick\n\nyou out if you complain before the union, obviously that person\n\ndoesn't   want     to   have   you   there   anymore.   And   that's   why   I\n\nresigned.\"\n\n            B.    AEELA's Motions\n\n            At the end of Monteagudo's presentation of her argument,\n\nAEELA orally moved for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50\n\nstating the following:         \"At this time we want to move for judgment\n\nas a matter of law, not on the merits of the case, which are\n\nobviously subject to credibility issues for the jury, but on the\n\nsubject of [the] affirmative defense limited by the Supreme Court\n\nin the case of Ellerth and Faragher regarding vicarious liability\n\nby an employer.\"        AEELA noted that its motion was based on this\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\f\"single discrete issue.\" The district court denied AEELA's motion.\n\nAt the close of all evidence and before the case went to the jury,\n\nAEELA renewed its motion under \"the Faragher issue\" stating that\n\n\"[p]retty much in our case in chief, nothing further was added, as\n\nfar as factually towards this defense.              It would be the same\n\narguments of law and fact, but we need to raise it to preserve it.\"\n\nThe district court again denied AEELA's motion.\n\n            On June 1, 2007, the jury found Monteagudo was subjected\n\nto sexual harassment in violation of Title VII and Puerto Rico Laws\n\n17,   69,   and   100,3   and   awarded   her   compensatory   and   punitive\n\ndamages.4     On June 15, 2007, AEELA again filed a motion for\n\n\n3\n   Law 17 prohibits sexual harassment in employment. 29 P.R. Laws\nAnn. § 155. Law 69 prohibits employment discrimination on account\nof gender. 29 P.R. Laws Ann. § 1321. Law 100 is analogous to Title\nVII and prohibits discrimination on the basis of age, race, color,\nsex, social or national origin, social condition, political\naffiliation, political or religious ideology. 29 P.R. Laws Ann.\n§ 146.\n4\n    The jury found by a preponderance of evidence that (1)\n\"[Monteagudo] was constructively discharged from her employment at\nAEELA specifically as a consequence of sexual harassment; (2)\n\"AEELA approved an anti-sexual harassment policy which provided the\nprocedure for employees to channel their claims and that the policy\nwas disseminated among the employees\"; (3) Monteagudo was not\nunreasonable in her \"fail[ure] to use the procedure provided in the\nanti-sexual harassment policy in effect at AEELA; and that (4) \"she\nwas subjected to a sexually hostile work environment in violation\nof Puerto Rico law.\"\n\n     The jury also found that the amount of compensatory damages\nthat \"Monteagudo suffered as a proximate result of the sexually\nhostile work environment to which she was subjected by AEELA\"\ntotaled $333,000 and that Monteagudo should be awarded $300,000 in\npunitive damages.\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fjudgment as a matter of law on the basis that Monteagudo was not\n\nsubjected to a \"severe or pervasive\" hostile work environment and\n\nthat AEELA met the burden of proof required in the Faragher-Ellerth\n\ndefense.   AEELA argued that no reasonable jury could find that\n\nMonteagudo's failure to use the procedures specified by AEELA's\n\nsexual harassment policy was reasonable.    AEELA also moved for a\n\nnew trial and for remittitur of the damages award.\n\n           The district court denied AEELA's motion for judgment as\n\na matter of law, noting first that AEELA did not object to the\n\ncourt's instruction on the Faragher-Ellerth defense.   The district\n\ncourt then offered the following reasons for its denial of AEELA's\n\nmotion:\n\n           At trial, Plaintiff testified that her\n           supervisor, Arce, sexually harassed her by\n           repeatedly touching her on the shoulders,\n           asking her out, and one occasion trying to\n           kiss her.    She also testified that Vargas,\n           Defendant's Human Resources Director, was\n           aware of Arce's unlawful behavior and was an\n           active participant in the harassment. Vargas,\n           on another occasion, had threatened to fire\n           Plaintiff if she complained about excessive\n           workload. Finally, Plaintiff testified that\n           Pablo Crespo, Defendant's Executive Director,\n           was friends with Arce and Vargas. Plaintiff's\n\n\n     On the same day, the district court entered an order modifying\nthe judgment because the jury did not apportion the compensatory\ndamage award between the Puerto Rico and federal Title VII claims.\nAccordingly, the district court ruled that it \"allocates $1 of the\ncompensatory damages to the Title VII claim and the remaining\n$332,999.00 to the Commonwealth claims\" and \"[p]ursuant to the\ndamages provisions of Puerto Rico Laws 17, 69, and 100, the court\nwill double the compensatory damages under the Commonwealth\nclaims.\" As a result, Monteagudo's total award was $965,999.\n\n                                -8-\n\f          testimony was bolstered by Figueroa Cana,\n          another of Defendant's employee [sic], who\n          said during trial that he had told Plaintiff\n          that she did not have a real opportunity of\n          obtaining relief because of the high ranking\n          officers involved in the harassment and cover\n          up. In light of the above, the court cannot\n          conclude that no reasonable jury could have\n          found that Plaintiff acted reasonably when she\n          failed to follow Defendant's anti-sexual\n          harassment policy.\n\n          In a separate order, the district court denied AEELA's\n\nmotion for a new trial on damages noting that \"the verdict of\n\n$965,999.00 is in part the result of Puerto Rico Laws 17, 69, and\n\n100, which double the plaintiff's compensation.\" AEELA appeals the\n\ndistrict court's ruling on these two motions as well as certain\n\ndiscovery and evidentiary rulings at trial.\n\n                          II.   Discussion\n\n          A.   AEELA's Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law\n\n                  1.   Standard of Review\n\n          Our review of a denial of a motion for judgment as a\n\nmatter of law under Fed. R. Civ. P. 50 is de novo, \"viewing the\n\nevidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\"\n\nMarcano Rivera v. Turabo Med. Ctr. P'ship, 415 F.3d 162, 167 (1st\n\nCir. 2005) (quoting Tapalian v. Tusino, 377 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.\n\n2004)). We note that \"[a] party seeking to overturn a jury verdict\n\nfaces an uphill battle,\" id., and that our \"review is weighted\n\ntoward preservation of the jury verdict . . . .\" Crowe v. Bolduc,\n\n334 F.3d 124, 134 (1st Cir. 2003).          \"Courts may only grant a\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fjudgment contravening a jury's determination when the evidence\n\npoints so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of the moving party\n\nthat no reasonable jury could have returned a verdict adverse to\n\nthat party.\"   Marcano Rivera, 415 F.3d at 167 (quoting Rivera\n\nCastillo v. Autokirey, Inc., 379 F.3d 4, 9 (1st Cir. 2004)).\n\n          Here, although AEELA makes several claims on appeal of\n\nthe denial of its Rule 50 motion,5 we consider preserved only its\n\nclaim regarding the Faragher-Ellerth affirmative defense.    As we\n\nrecently reasoned:\n\n          A motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a) must\n          \"specify the judgment sought and the law and\n          facts   that  entitle   the   movant    to  the\n          judgment.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a)(2). The\n          motion \"must be sufficiently specific so as to\n          apprise the district court of the grounds\n          relied on in support of the motion.\" Zachar\n          v. Lee, 363 F.3d 70, 73 (1st Cir. 2004)\n          (citing Correa v. Hosp. San Francisco, 69 F.3d\n          1184, 1196 (1st Cir. 1995)). Such a motion\n          \"preserves for review only those grounds\n          specified at the time, and no others.\" Id.\n          (quoting Correa, 69 F.3d at 1196) . . . But,\n          \"[a]s the name implies, a renewed motion for\n          judgment as a matter of law under Fed. R. Civ.\n          P. 50(b) is bounded by the movant's earlier\n          Rule 50(a) motion.\" Correa, 69 F.3d at 1196.\n          \"The movant cannot use such a motion as a\n          vehicle to introduce a legal theory not\n          distinctly       articulated         in     its\n          close-of-evidence   motion   for   a   directed\n          verdict.\" Id.\n\n\n\n\n5\n   Although raised in an inartful manner on appeal, we consider\ninfra AEELA's challenges to the district court's rulings on certain\nevidentiary and discovery issues at trial.\n\n                               -10-\n\fParker v. Gerrish, 547 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir. 2008).                AEELA stated\n\nthat it wished to preserve only one issue in its Rule 50(a) motion;\n\nthus, the only issue that we consider pursuant to its renewed\n\nmotion   is    whether     AEELA   is   entitled   to   the   Faragher-Ellerth\n\ndefense.\n\n                      2.    AEELA's Affirmative Defense\n\n              We   have    explained    the    Faragher-Ellerth    defense   as\n\nfollowing:\n\n              Under Title VII, an employer is subject to\n              vicarious liability for sexual harassment by\n              an employee's supervisor which does not\n              constitute a tangible employment action. But\n              the employer may prevail if it demonstrates a\n              two-part affirmative defense: that its own\n              actions to prevent and correct harassment were\n              reasonable and that the employee's actions in\n              seeking to avoid harm were not reasonable.\n\nChaloult v. Interstate Brands Corp., 540 F.3d 64, 66 (1st Cir.\n\n2008) (citing Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775, 807\n\n(1998); Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, 765\n\n(1998)).6\n\n              The parties agree that the sexual harassment policy AEELA\n\nhad in place was sufficient for it to meet the first prong of the\n\ndefense. See Arrieta-Colón v. Wal-Mart P.R., Inc., 434 F.3d 75, 86\n\n\n\n6\n   In the motion for judgment as a matter of law below there was\nsome dispute among the parties as to whether a constructive\ndischarge constitutes a \"tangible employment action\" for the\npurposes of the Faragher-Ellerth defense. However, the district\ncourt did not address this issue in its opinion and Monteagudo does\nnot raise this issue here.\n\n                                        -11-\n\f(1st Cir. 2006) (\"As to the first element of the defense, proof of\n\nan anti-harassment policy with a complaint procedure available to\n\nemployees,   while       not   necessarily   dispositive,       is    relevant.\");\n\nMarrero v. Goya of Puerto Rico, Inc., 304 F.3d 7, 21 (1st Cir.\n\n2002) (\"[T]he availability of the affirmative defense often will\n\nturn on whether the employer had established and disseminated an\n\nanti-discrimination        policy,    complete     with   a   known      complaint\n\nprocedure.\").     Thus, Monteagudo concedes \"that the only matter for\n\nconsideration under the [Faragher-Ellerth] defense is the second\n\nprong of the defense.\"\n\n           Regarding the second prong, in Reed v. MBNA Marketing\n\nSystems, Inc., we remarked that while \"[t]here is no bright-line\n\nrule as to when a failure to file a complaint becomes unreasonable\n\n. . . more than ordinary fear or embarrassment is needed.\"                     333\n\nF.3d 27, 35 (1st Cir. 2003).           As set forth above, AEELA's sexual\n\nharassment policy states that an employee who is a victim of sexual\n\nharassment      should    first    present   her   complaint     to     the   Human\n\nResources department, unless the alleged harasser is within or\n\nclose to someone within the department.            If this is the case, as it\n\nis here given our facts, the employee is required to report the\n\nsexual harassment to AEELA's Executive Director.                     Thus, we must\n\ndetermine whether a jury could conclude that Monteagudo's reasons\n\nfor   failing    to   report      Arce's   conduct   to   her    superiors     was\n\nunreasonable.\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\f            From our review of the record, Monteagudo presented\n\nseveral reasons for not reporting the sexual harassment to Vargas.\n\nVargas admitted that he was friends with Arce.                     Monteagudo also\n\ntestified   that     Vargas    and    Arce     would     often   go     out      drinking\n\ntogether.    Monteagudo was thus understandably reluctant to report\n\nArce's behavior to Vargas because of the closeness of Vargas's\n\nrelationship with Arce.\n\n            The    more     difficult        question,    however,         is     whether\n\nMonteagudo's      failure    to     report    Arce's     conduct      to   Crespo    was\n\nunreasonable on the basis of Crespo's alleged friendship with Arce\n\nand Vargas.       The only evidence that Monteagudo proffers for this\n\nfriendship are conversations she overheard by Vargas and Arce and\n\nthe fact that Crespo testified that he may have gone out with Arce\n\nfor drinks.       Admittedly, Monteagudo did not establish Crespo's\n\nrelationship with Arce as clearly as she established Vargas's\n\nrelationship with Arce; however, as we acknowledged in Reed,\n\n\"juries are supposed to be good at detecting false claims and at\n\nevaluating reasonable behavior in human situations.\"                       Id. at 37.\n\n            Further, other factors that the jury could have taken\n\ninto account in deciding that it was reasonable for Monteagudo not\n\nto report to her superiors included Figueroa's advice to her that\n\nthe matter was \"extremely difficult and quite delicate\" given the\n\npeople   involved,    and     the    fact    that   witnesses      to      the   alleged\n\n\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\fharassment failed to report the sexual harassment as well.7                  In\n\naddition,     there   was   a   significant      age   differential    between\n\nMonteagudo,    22,    and   Arce,   45,   when   the   harassment     occurred.\n\nAlthough Monteagudo was not a minor as was the plaintiff in Reed,\n\nher relative youth compared to Arce bears at least some relevance.\n\nSee id. (noting that a jury could consider the trauma inflicted by\n\na supervisor who was more than double the age of a seventeen year\n\nold whom the supervisor was alleged to have assaulted).                  While\n\nMonteagudo's evidence is not overwhelming, we believe that a\n\nreasonable jury could conclude that her failure to report was based\n\non \"more than ordinary fear or embarrassment\" and was therefore\n\nreasonable.8\n\n\n7\n  Monteagudo testified that Vargas and her colleague, Marilyn Del\nValle-Cruz (\"Del Valle\"), were aware of the sexual harassment.\nAlthough Vargas and Del Valle deny knowledge of the sexual\nharassment, the jury was entitled to believe Monteagudo's version\ngiven the facts surrounding the case.\n8\n   AEELA also maintains that a jury could not reasonably conclude\nthat Monteagudo's failure to file a complaint with her union\npursuant to the collective bargaining agreement was reasonable. We\ndisagree. Monteagudo was advised by Figueroa, a union delegate,\nthat filing a complaint would be futile because the matter involved\npeople that made it \"extremely difficult and quite delicate\"; that\nthe union was weak; and that the union president was friendly with\nVargas.    Furthermore, Monteagudo stated that the union was\nunresponsive to a prior complaint she had filed on an unrelated\nmatter.\n\n     We note here AEELA's claim that Monteagudo did not produce a\ncopy of this prior complaint during discovery, even though AEELA\nhad requested it. AEELA contends that the district court erred by\ndisallowing AEELA to pursue a line of questioning \"directed towards\ndiscrediting Monteagudo's testimony about supposedly having filed\nthe grievance at issue.\" Further, AEELA asserts that the district\n\n                                     -14-\n\f              B.   AEELA's Evidentiary Claim\n\n                      1.   Standard of Review\n\n              We review a trial court's decision to admit or exclude\n\nevidence for abuse of discretion. McDonough v. City of Quincy, 452\n\nF.3d 8, 19 (1st Cir. 2006).      \"A district court has broad discretion\n\nto make relevancy determinations . . . .\"        Richards v. Relentless,\n\nInc., 341 F.3d 35, 49 (1st Cir. 2003).             Erroneous evidentiary\n\nrulings are harmless \"if it is highly probable that the error did\n\nnot affect the outcome of the case.\"       McDonough, 452 F.3d at 19-20.\n\n                      2.   The Challenged Testimony\n\n              AEELA argues that the district court erred in disallowing\n\ntestimony from Blanca Medina, AEELA's Director of Administrative\n\nand   Legal    Affairs,    regarding   whether   AEELA   had   successfully\n\nemployed a corrective measure in 2005 pursuant to the sexual\n\nharassment policy.         Monteagudo had objected to this testimony,\n\nstating that Medina's testimony on this issue was not \"pertinent at\n\nthis time.\"        Upon Monteagudo's objection, the parties approached\n\n\n\ncourt erred by stating that AEELA had not previously moved to\ncompel the document. We agree with the district court that this\nwas a discovery issue that AEELA should have addressed earlier\neither by way of a motion to compel or a request for sanctions\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c). However, even if we were to decide\notherwise, any error would be harmless as the jury could have\nconcluded that Monteagudo was reasonable in her decision not to\nfile a complaint with the union based on the other reasons\narticulated above. In any event, we are hard pressed to see how\nAEELA was disadvantaged as the district court allowed AEELA to ask\nMonteagudo a series of questions about the document and its\nwhereabouts for purposes of impeachment.\n\n                                    -15-\n\fthe bench and a colloquy ensued between the parties and the\n\ndistrict court.9   This exchange resulted in the apparent agreement\n\nby AEELA to the following instruction given to the jury immediately\n\nafter the bench conference:\n\n           The witness stated that in 2005, certain\n           procedures were followed in another case.\n           We're not going to go into that line of\n           questioning. And so that what she was saying,\n           we're not going to continue further, but let\n           me instruct the jury that the fact that\n\n\n9\n    The transcript of the bench conference reads as follows:\n\n      The Court: I think I should instruct the jury -- she\n      already gave that answer. I should instruct the jury\n      that the fact that in 2005 corrective measures were taken\n      is not evidence of what happened in this case.\n\n      Mr. Martínez-Luciano [AEELA's counsel]: The reason why\n      I'm asking about this is because part of plaintiff's\n      theory as stated today in opening statements . . . [is]\n      that the proceedings in AEELA are not worth following,\n      that they're not effective.\n\n      Mr. González-Muñoz [Monteagudo's counsel]: No. What I\n      said during opening statement was that it was not\n      followed in Michelle's case, and limited myself to this\n      case.   It's not that [AEELA's harassment policy] is\n      ineffective. In this case it was not followed. That's\n      what I said in opening statements.\n\n      Mr. Martínez-Luciano: It's not a theory you're going to\n      pursue in closing arguments?\n\n      Mr. González-Muñoz:     No, no.   I'm here for Michelle's\n      case.\n\n      The Court: I'm not going to strike the testimony at this\n      time. Careful with the question. Whatever she stated in\n      2005 is not probative of what may have happened or not\n      happened in 2002.\n\n      Mr. Martínez-Luciano:    Okay.\n\n                                 -16-\n\f           certain procedures may have been followed in\n           2005, they're not conclusive, they're not\n           probative of whatever may have happened in\n           2002.   So in that effect, in that regard,\n           you're not to consider that statement as\n           probative one way or the other of what may\n           have happened in 2002.\n\n           From   this      exchange,       it    is   not    clear    whether     AEELA\n\npreserved its opposition to the court's evidentiary ruling because\n\nAEELA   consented      to    the        court's    decision      to    give    a      jury\n\ninstruction.10    Assuming that AEELA has preserved the issue for\n\nappeal, however, the district court did not err by excluding the\n\ntestimony on relevance grounds. Unlike other circuits, we have not\n\nrequired   that   in    order      to    overcome      the    second   prong     of   the\n\nFaragher-Ellerth       affirmative        defense,      plaintiffs     must    produce\n\nevidence demonstrating \"that the employer has ignored or resisted\n\nsimilar complaints or has taken adverse action against employees in\n\nresponse to such complaints.\"               See, e.g., Leopold v. Baccarat,\n\nInc., 239 F.3d 243, 246 (2d Cir. 2001).                      Here, since Monteagudo\n\nlimited her argument to the application of AEELA's policy to her\n\ncase, the district court was within its discretion to exclude as\n\nnot relevant AEELA's attempt to show that it had taken corrective\n\nmeasures pursuant to the policy in 2005.\n\n\n\n10\n    At closing argument Monteagudo's counsel stated that AEELA's\nsexual harassment policy \"had been proven defective.\" Upon AEELA's\nobjection, the court directed Monteagudo's counsel to correct\nhimself by explaining to the jury that any argument regarding the\napplication of the policy's effectiveness pertains to Monteagudo\nonly.\n\n                                          -17-\n\f          C.   AEELA's Motion for New Trial and Remittitur of\n               Damages\n\n                  1.   Standard of Review\n\n          AEELA also appeals the district court's denial of its\n\nmotion for new trial or remittitur under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59.        \"'A\n\ndistrict court should only grant such motions if the outcome is\n\nagainst the clear weight of the evidence such that upholding the\n\nverdict will result in a miscarriage of justice.'\" Marcano Rivera,\n\n415 F.3d at 171 (quoting Johnson v. Spencer Press of Me., Inc., 364\n\nF.3d 368, 375 (1st Cir. 2004)).      We review for abuse of discretion.\n\nId.\n\n                  2.   Damages\n\n                         a.    Compensatory Damages\n\n          \"'[A] party seeking remittitur bears a heavy burden of\n\nshowing that an award is grossly excessive, inordinate, shocking to\n\nthe conscience of the court, or so high that it would be a denial\n\nof justice to permit it to stand.'\"         Id. at 173 (alteration in\n\noriginal) (quoting Currier v. United Techs. Corp., 393 F.3d 246,\n\n256 (1st Cir. 2004)).         \"[T]he Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has\n\nindicated that it 'will not intervene in the decision on the\n\nestimation of damages issued by the lower courts, unless the\n\namounts granted are ridiculously low or exaggeratedly high.'\"        Id.\n\nat 172 (quoting Nieves Cruz v. Universidad de Puerto Rico, 151 P.R.\n\nDec. 150 (2000) (certified translation)). Thus, \"Puerto Rico's\n\n'exaggeratedly   high'    standard     echoes   the   federal   'grossly\n\n                                   -18-\n\fexcessive' standard.\"      Id.    We stress that \"only infrequently --\n\nand then, for compelling reasons -- will we, from the vantage point\n\nof an algid appellate record, override the jury's judgment as to\n\nthe appropriate amount of non-economic damages to which a plaintiff\n\nis entitled.\" Casillas-Díaz v. Palau, 463 F.3d 77, 82-83 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).\n\n             Here,   the   jury    awarded   Monteagudo   $333,000    in\n\ncompensatory damages without apportioning the award between the\n\nPuerto Rico and the Title VII claims.          The jury also awarded\n\nMonteagudo $300,000 in punitive damages under Title VII.             Upon\n\nMonteagudo's motion, the district court issued an order allocating\n\n$1 of the compensatory damages award to the Title VII claims and\n\nthe remaining $332,999 to the claims under Puerto Rico laws 17, 69,\n\nand 100.11     The district court then doubled the amount awarded\n\npursuant to the Puerto Rico claims as required by Puerto Rico law,\n\nresulting in a total award amount of $965,999.      See P.R. Laws Ann.\n\ntit. 29, § 155j(1); P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, § 146(a)(1); P.R. Laws\n\nAnn. tit. 29, § 1341(a)(1).\n\n             With respect to compensatory damages, we hold that the\n\njury's award here of $333,000 was neither \"grossly excessive\" to\n\n\"shock the conscience\" of this court, nor was it \"exaggeratedly\n\n\n\n11\n    \"In this circuit, punitive damages may not be awarded under\nTitle VII without the award of at least nominal compensatory\ndamages.\" Rodríguez-Torres v. Caribbean Form Mfr., Inc., 399 F.3d\n52, 65 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                                   -19-\n\fhigh.\"    Admittedly the jury was generous in awarding this amount;\n\nhowever,   the   district   court   did    not   abuse   its   discretion   in\n\ndeciding that the award was proportionate to harm suffered by\n\nMonteagudo.      As we expressed above, as a result of the sexual\n\nharassment she endured for several months, Monteagudo felt \"like a\n\npiece of meat\" and wept every evening.             After her constructive\n\ndischarge, she testified that she suffered from depression and an\n\ninability to sleep.    We note that a \"verdict approved by both the\n\njurors and the trial judge will be pared 'only if it is shown to\n\nexceed any rational appraisal or estimate of the damages that could\n\nbe based upon the evidence before the jury.'\"            Casillas-Díaz, 463\n\nF.3d at 83 (quoting Dopp v. Pritzker, 38 F.3d 1239, 1249 (1st Cir.\n\n1994)).    Given our facts and the highly deferential standard we\n\nmust apply, this is not such a case.        Moreover, the jury award here\n\nis commensurate with non-economic compensatory damage awards we\n\nhave upheld in other Title VII and employment discrimination\n\ncontexts.12\n\n\n12\n   See McDonough, 452 F.3d at 22 (upholding $300,000 compensatory\ndamages award where \"bulk of the award\" was for emotional distress\nin the form of humiliation, damage to reputation, and strained\nfamily relations); Valentín-Almeyda v. Municipality of Aguadilla,\n447 F.3d 85, 103 (1st Cir. 2006) (upholding compensatory damages\naward of $705,000 on the basis of harassment and threat of\nreprisals where plaintiff suffered emotional damages and mental\nanguish such as insomnia, anxiety, guilt, and depression as well as\nserious economic damages); Rodríguez-Torres, 399 F.3d at 64\n(upholding on plain error review emotional distress damages of\n$250,000 in case involving claims under Title VII, Law 69, and Law\n100 where Plaintiff \"experienced financial difficulties, her\nmarriage suffered, she entered a deep depression which lasted 'for\n\n                                    -20-\n\f                          b.

Puerto Rico, 451 F.3d 13, 36 (1st Cir. 2006)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n          Here, we disagree with AEELA's claim that it properly\n\npreserved its challenge to the punitive damages award by filing a\n\ntimely motion under Rule 59(a).   In its new trial and remittitur\n\nmotion, AEELA did not provide any developed argumentation as to why\n\nMonteagudo should not be entitled to punitive damages.     Further,\n\nAEELA did not cite any cases for its proposition that punitive\n\ndamages are unwarranted. \"[T]heories not raised squarely in the\n\ndistrict court cannot be surfaced for the first time on appeal.\"\n\nMcCoy v. Mass. Inst. of Tech., 950 F.2d 13, 22 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n\"This prophylactic rule requires litigants to spell out their legal\n\ntheories face-up and squarely in the trial court; if a claim is\n\n'merely insinuated' rather than 'actually articulated,' that claim\n\nordinarily is deemed unpreserved for purposes of appellate review.\"\n\nIverson v. City of Boston, 452 F.3d 94, 102 (1st Cir. 2006)\n\n(quoting McCoy, 950 F.2d at 22); see also In re Olympic Mills\n\nCorp., 477 F.3d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 2007) (holding a claim against\n\ndamages award waived because \"as presented to the district court\n\n. . . the argument was fatally undeveloped, comprising only four\n\nsentences, a citation to a district court opinion, and no analysis\n\nwhatsoever\").\n\n          Applying the plain error standard, then, we must first\n\ndecide whether the district court committed an error.    \"Title VII\n\n\n                               -22-\n\fauthorizes punitive damages when a plaintiff demonstrates that the\n\ndefendant engaged in intentional discrimination 'with malice or\n\nreckless indifference to the federally protected rights of an\n\naggrieved individual.'\"   Rodríguez-Torres, 399 F.3d at 64 (quoting\n\n42 U.S.C. 1981a(b)(1)).   In Kolstad v. American Dental Ass'n., 527\n\nU.S. 526 (1999), the Supreme Court set forth a framework for\n\ndetermining the appropriateness of punitive damages.        Following\n\nKolstad, once a plaintiff has shown that \"the employer acted with\n\nmalicious or reckless indifference to the plaintiff's federally\n\nprotected rights,\" \"she then must establish a basis for imputing\n\nliability to the employer.\"   Rodríguez-Torres, 399 F.3d at 64.    We\n\nhave stated that \"the plaintiff may meet this burden by showing\n\nthat the employee who discriminated against her was a managerial\n\nagent acting within the scope of his employment.\"     Id.   \"[E]ven if\n\nthe plaintiff makes these showings, the employer still may avoid\n\npunitive liability by showing that it engaged in good faith efforts\n\nto implement an anti-discrimination policy.\"    Id.   \"Demonstrating\n\ngood faith compliance is an affirmative defense, and the burden of\n\nproof therefore rests with the employer.\" Id.\n\n          Here, a reasonable jury could conclude that Arce was\n\nacting in a managerial capacity when engaging in the acts of sexual\n\nharassment.    Also, as a supervisor, Arce should have been aware\n\nthat his actions were against AEELA's sexual harassment policy and\n\nfederal law.   A closer question is whether AEELA was entitled to\n\n\n                                -23-\n\fits affirmative defense of good faith compliance, especially in\n\nview of the jury's finding that AEELA had satisfied the first prong\n\nof its Faragher-Ellerth defense.                 The question before us then is\n\nwhether the fact that AEELA had a sexual harassment policy in place\n\nthat was disseminated to its employees was sufficient to show \"good\n\nfaith compliance\" in order to avoid punitive damages.\n\n            We have stated that while \"a written non-discrimination\n\npolicy is one indication of an employer's efforts to comply with\n\nTitle    VII.    .    .    .    a    written       statement,      without    more,   is\n\ninsufficient     to       insulate    an    employer      from     punitive    damages\n\nliability.\"     Romano v. U-Haul Int'l, 233 F.3d 655, 670 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).     From our review of the record, AEELA has not provided\n\nsufficient proof that it had in place an \"active mechanism for\n\nrenewing   employees'          awareness    of     the   policies    through     either\n\nspecific    education          programs    or     periodic   re-dissemination         or\n\nrevision of their written materials\";13 \"testimony by appellants'\n\nwitnesses that indicated that supervisors were trained to prevent\n\ndiscrimination       from      occurring;\"        or   \"examples    in   which   their\n\nanti-discrimination policies were successfully followed.\"14 Id.\n\n\n13\n   Notably, Monteagudo testified that she had never been offered\na seminar on sexual harassment and that she was unaware if any\nsexual harassment seminars had been given to her supervisors.\n14\n   We acknowledge that AEELA was rebuffed by the district court in\nits attempt to show how its policy was successfully implemented in\n2005. However, as we noted in assessing AEELA's evidentiary claim\nabove, this evidence was not proffered to show that AEELA should\nnot have been liable for punitive damages. Rather, AEELA attempted\n\n                                           -24-\n\f(providing    a   non-exhaustive   list   of    ways   an   employer   could\n\ndemonstrate good faith compliance).            While having all of these\n\nfactors is not necessary to qualify for the defense, see id., AEELA\n\nhas not provided sufficient evidence that it fulfilled any of these\n\nfactors.     Thus, the district court did not commit plain error in\n\nupholding the punitive damages award and denying a new trial on\n\ndamages.\n\n                           III.    Conclusion\n\n            For the foregoing reasons, the district court judgment is\n\naffirmed.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\nto introduce Medina's testimony in order to bolster its Faragher-\nEllerth defense. This was evidence which the district court was\nwithin its discretion to exclude. Even if the district court had\nconsidered the 2005 corrective measure AEELA had employed pursuant\nto its policy, the district court still did not commit plain error\nin upholding the punitive damages award. This is because AEELA\nfailed to provide sufficient evidence of other indicators of good\nfaith compliance and because the 2005 corrective measure occurred\nthree years after the sexual harassment in this case.

Michelle Monteagudo brought\n\nsuit alleging sexual harassment claims under federal and Puerto\n\nRico law against her former employer, Asociación de Empleados del\n\nEstado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico (\"AEELA\"),1 in the United\n\nStates District Court for the District of Puerto Rico.                On June 1,\n\n2007,   a   jury    found   that    Monteagudo     was   subjected    to     sexual\n\nharassment in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and\n\nPuerto Rico Laws 17, 69, and 100, and awarded her compensatory and\n\npunitive damages.       AEELA moved for judgment as a matter of law on\n\nthe Faragher-Ellerth affirmative defense pursuant to Federal Rule\n\nof Civil Procedure 50 and also moved for a new trial and remittitur\n\nof the damages award pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n59.     AEELA appeals the district court's denial of both these\n\nmotions as well as certain evidentiary and discovery rulings made\n\nduring trial.       After careful consideration, we affirm.\n\n                               I.     Background\n\n            A.     Monteagudo's Experience at AEELA\n\n            Monteagudo      started    working     at    AEELA   in   1999    as   a\n\nsecretary in the Human Resources department. At that time, she was\n\na non-permanent employee, substituting for the permanent secretary\n\nwho was out on maternity leave.         Monteagudo was supervised by Juan\n\nFrancisco Arce-Díaz (\"Arce\"), a payroll, fringe benefits, and\n\ncompensation manager for AEELA.              At trial, Monteagudo testified\n\n\n1\n    AEELA is a non-profit savings and loans organization.\n\n                                       -2-\n\fthat during her time as a substitute, Arce \"would look at [her] as\n\nif he was appraising [her].\"     However, she \"didn't give it much\n\nimportance\" because she did not view Arce's conduct to be that\n\nserious.\n\n           Monteagudo testified that Arce's conduct continued until\n\nArce's permanent secretary returned from maternity leave, at which\n\npoint Monteagudo stopped working in the Human Resources department.\n\nOn October 2, 2000, after stints in AEELA's legal collections and\n\nlegal affairs divisions, Monteagudo returned to the Human Resources\n\ndepartment as a permanent employee. Once there, Monteagudo claimed\n\nthat Arce engaged in inappropriate conduct towards her.             For\n\nexample, she remarked that Arce would come to her work station at\n\nleast once a day where \"he would stop and touch [her] on the\n\nshoulder.\"   Monteagudo stated that she resisted Arce's advances by\n\n\"throw[ing] his hand backwards so he'd leave [her] alone.\"          She\n\nalso complained that Arce would \"invit[e] [her] constantly to go\n\nout together\" with co-workers on double dates.\n\n           Monteagudo testified to the unpleasantness she felt as a\n\nresult of Arce's conduct: \"How can I feel except bad?         They were\n\ntreating me like a piece of meat.         I wouldn't like to go to work\n\n. . . I didn't like to go into the office, because I knew what I\n\nwould be involved and engaged in every day there.\"\n\n           On   one   such   day,     José    Francisco   Figueroa-Cana\n\n(\"Figueroa\"), a messenger for AEELA since 1996, witnessed Arce\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f\"plac[ing] his hand on [Monteagudo's] hip\" in \"an undesirable\n\naction.\" When he discussed this incident with Monteagudo, she told\n\nhim that \"that was something that normally took place . . . that\n\n[Arce] would always try to seek a way so he could touch her.\"\n\nFigueroa testified that he was uncertain about what recourse\n\nMonteagudo   should    take   because     this   was   a   matter    that   was\n\n\"extremely difficult and quite delicate\" given the people involved.\n\nEven though Figueroa was a union delegate, he decided against\n\nbringing the matter up to the union president because \"it was\n\nextremely difficult to bring forth something like this dealing with\n\nwho we dealt with,\" the union was a \"very weak institution within\n\nAEELA,\"   and   because   the     union    president       had   a   \"friendly\n\nrelationship\"   with    Orlando     Vargas-López       (\"Vargas\"),    AEELA's\n\nDirector of Human Resources and Labor Relations.\n\n          Monteagudo,     perhaps       partly   as    a    result    of    her\n\nconversation with Figueroa, did not report Arce's conduct to her\n\nsuperiors as required by AEELA's sexual harassment policy.2                 This\n\npolicy was in effect and distributed to Monteagudo while she was a\n\n\n2\n   Two provisions of AEELA's sexual harassment policy are relevant\nto this appeal. Section 3.2 of the policy states: \"An employee who\nfeels he has been sexually harassed at work in any way, should\npresent his complaint to the Human Resources Department. If the\nalleged harasser should be this person, or anyone related or close\nto him, then the complaint must be presented directly to the\nAssociation's Executive Director.\"     Section 3.3 of the policy\nstates: \"It is the responsibility of any employee who witnesses a\nsexual harassment act, or if any other employee has complained of\nbeing a victim of sexual harassment, to immediately inform the\nappropriate official.\"\n\n                                    -4-\n\fpermanent employee.     At trial, Monteagudo explained that she did\n\nnot report the sexual harassment \"[b]ecause the person I needed to\n\ncomplain with were all friends.\"         She added: \"Either it be the\n\nexecutive director or the human resources director, they're all\n\nfriends amongst themselves.      We're talking about some managerials\n\n[sic] versus an employee who virtually had started working a few\n\ndays before.\"      She claimed that the Executive Director, Pablo\n\nCrespo-Claudio     (\"Crespo\"),   was   friends   with   Vargas    and   Arce\n\n\"[b]ecause of conversations held by Orlando Vargas and Francisco\n\nArce themselves,\" noting that \"I tend to understand that if some\n\npeople go out together to drink liquor, they're friends who go out\n\nto be together.\"    Crespo admitted in his testimony that he may have\n\ngone out for drinks with Vargas and Arce.\n\n          Monteagudo testified that Arce's inappropriate behavior\n\ntowards her continued for several months leading up to an incident\n\nduring a group outing to a local bar, where in the parking lot,\n\nArce \"pulled [her] towards him to try to kiss [her].\"            Monteagudo\n\npushed him away that evening, but testified that when she returned\n\nto work the following Monday after the incident \"the attitude\n\ndisplayed towards [her] by Mr. Vargas and Mr. Arce\" was \"different\"\n\nand that the additional work given to her was excessive.                Also,\n\nwhen she complained to Vargas that she was performing two positions\n\nsimultaneously, in addition to assisting colleagues from other\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fdivisions, Vargas \"slammed the desk very hard and told [her] that\n\nif [she] filed a complaint, the next day [she] would be dismissed.\"\n\n            At trial, Monteagudo described her work conditions as\n\nintolerable due to the fact that her superiors did not permit\n\n\"anyone at all to stop over to talk to [her], even to just say good\n\nmorning.\"        Further, she explained the emotional toll AEELA's\n\nactions took on her: \"[E]very evening I'd be crying, I would leave\n\nwork crying, because there was a constant scolding for everything,\n\neverything I did was wrong.          Everything.\"   Thus, Monteagudo stated\n\nthat she was left with no choice but to resign, resulting in what\n\nthe jury later found to be a constructive discharge: \"Obviously, if\n\nsomebody is putting so much pressure on you and threatening to kick\n\nyou out if you complain before the union, obviously that person\n\ndoesn't   want     to   have   you   there   anymore.   And   that's   why   I\n\nresigned.\"\n\n            B.    AEELA's Motions\n\n            At the end of Monteagudo's presentation of her argument,\n\nAEELA orally moved for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50\n\nstating the following:         \"At this time we want to move for judgment\n\nas a matter of law, not on the merits of the case, which are\n\nobviously subject to credibility issues for the jury, but on the\n\nsubject of [the] affirmative defense limited by the Supreme Court\n\nin the case of Ellerth and Faragher regarding vicarious liability\n\nby an employer.\"        AEELA noted that its motion was based on this\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\f\"single discrete issue.\" The district court denied AEELA's motion.\n\nAt the close of all evidence and before the case went to the jury,\n\nAEELA renewed its motion under \"the Faragher issue\" stating that\n\n\"[p]retty much in our case in chief, nothing further was added, as\n\nfar as factually towards this defense.              It would be the same\n\narguments of law and fact, but we need to raise it to preserve it.\"\n\nThe district court again denied AEELA's motion.\n\n            On June 1, 2007, the jury found Monteagudo was subjected\n\nto sexual harassment in violation of Title VII and Puerto Rico Laws\n\n17,   69,   and   100,3   and   awarded   her   compensatory   and   punitive\n\ndamages.4     On June 15, 2007, AEELA again filed a motion for\n\n\n3\n   Law 17 prohibits sexual harassment in employment. 29 P.R. Laws\nAnn. § 155. Law 69 prohibits employment discrimination on account\nof gender. 29 P.R. Laws Ann. § 1321. Law 100 is analogous to Title\nVII and prohibits discrimination on the basis of age, race, color,\nsex, social or national origin, social condition, political\naffiliation, political or religious ideology. 29 P.R. Laws Ann.\n§ 146.\n4\n    The jury found by a preponderance of evidence that (1)\n\"[Monteagudo] was constructively discharged from her employment at\nAEELA specifically as a consequence of sexual harassment; (2)\n\"AEELA approved an anti-sexual harassment policy which provided the\nprocedure for employees to channel their claims and that the policy\nwas disseminated among the employees\"; (3) Monteagudo was not\nunreasonable in her \"fail[ure] to use the procedure provided in the\nanti-sexual harassment policy in effect at AEELA; and that (4) \"she\nwas subjected to a sexually hostile work environment in violation\nof Puerto Rico law.\"\n\n     The jury also found that the amount of compensatory damages\nthat \"Monteagudo suffered as a proximate result of the sexually\nhostile work environment to which she was subjected by AEELA\"\ntotaled $333,000 and that Monteagudo should be awarded $300,000 in\npunitive damages.\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fjudgment as a matter of law on the basis that Monteagudo was not\n\nsubjected to a \"severe or pervasive\" hostile work environment and\n\nthat AEELA met the burden of proof required in the Faragher-Ellerth\n\ndefense.   AEELA argued that no reasonable jury could find that\n\nMonteagudo's failure to use the procedures specified by AEELA's\n\nsexual harassment policy was reasonable.    AEELA also moved for a\n\nnew trial and for remittitur of the damages award.\n\n           The district court denied AEELA's motion for judgment as\n\na matter of law, noting first that AEELA did not object to the\n\ncourt's instruction on the Faragher-Ellerth defense.   The district\n\ncourt then offered the following reasons for its denial of AEELA's\n\nmotion:\n\n           At trial, Plaintiff testified that her\n           supervisor, Arce, sexually harassed her by\n           repeatedly touching her on the shoulders,\n           asking her out, and one occasion trying to\n           kiss her.    She also testified that Vargas,\n           Defendant's Human Resources Director, was\n           aware of Arce's unlawful behavior and was an\n           active participant in the harassment. Vargas,\n           on another occasion, had threatened to fire\n           Plaintiff if she complained about excessive\n           workload. Finally, Plaintiff testified that\n           Pablo Crespo, Defendant's Executive Director,\n           was friends with Arce and Vargas. Plaintiff's\n\n\n     On the same day, the district court entered an order modifying\nthe judgment because the jury did not apportion the compensatory\ndamage award between the Puerto Rico and federal Title VII claims.\nAccordingly, the district court ruled that it \"allocates $1 of the\ncompensatory damages to the Title VII claim and the remaining\n$332,999.00 to the Commonwealth claims\" and \"[p]ursuant to the\ndamages provisions of Puerto Rico Laws 17, 69, and 100, the court\nwill double the compensatory damages under the Commonwealth\nclaims.\" As a result, Monteagudo's total award was $965,999.\n\n                                -8-\n\f          testimony was bolstered by Figueroa Cana,\n          another of Defendant's employee [sic], who\n          said during trial that he had told Plaintiff\n          that she did not have a real opportunity of\n          obtaining relief because of the high ranking\n          officers involved in the harassment and cover\n          up. In light of the above, the court cannot\n          conclude that no reasonable jury could have\n          found that Plaintiff acted reasonably when she\n          failed to follow Defendant's anti-sexual\n          harassment policy.\n\n          In a separate order, the district court denied AEELA's\n\nmotion for a new trial on damages noting that \"the verdict of\n\n$965,999.00 is in part the result of Puerto Rico Laws 17, 69, and\n\n100, which double the plaintiff's compensation.\" AEELA appeals the\n\ndistrict court's ruling on these two motions as well as certain\n\ndiscovery and evidentiary rulings at trial.\n\n                          II.

As set forth above, AEELA's sexual\n\nharassment policy states that an employee who is a victim of sexual\n\nharassment      should    first    present   her   complaint     to     the   Human\n\nResources department, unless the alleged harasser is within or\n\nclose to someone within the department.            If this is the case, as it\n\nis here given our facts, the employee is required to report the\n\nsexual harassment to AEELA's Executive Director.                     Thus, we must\n\ndetermine whether a jury could conclude that Monteagudo's reasons\n\nfor   failing    to   report      Arce's   conduct   to   her    superiors     was\n\nunreasonable.\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\f            From our review of the record, Monteagudo presented\n\nseveral reasons for not reporting the sexual harassment to Vargas.\n\nVargas admitted that he was friends with Arce.                     Monteagudo also\n\ntestified   that     Vargas    and    Arce     would     often   go     out      drinking\n\ntogether.    Monteagudo was thus understandably reluctant to report\n\nArce's behavior to Vargas because of the closeness of Vargas's\n\nrelationship with Arce.\n\n            The    more     difficult        question,    however,         is     whether\n\nMonteagudo's      failure    to     report    Arce's     conduct      to   Crespo    was\n\nunreasonable on the basis of Crespo's alleged friendship with Arce\n\nand Vargas.       The only evidence that Monteagudo proffers for this\n\nfriendship are conversations she overheard by Vargas and Arce and\n\nthe fact that Crespo testified that he may have gone out with Arce\n\nfor drinks.       Admittedly, Monteagudo did not establish Crespo's\n\nrelationship with Arce as clearly as she established Vargas's\n\nrelationship with Arce; however, as we acknowledged in Reed,\n\n\"juries are supposed to be good at detecting false claims and at\n\nevaluating reasonable behavior in human situations.\"                       Id. at 37.\n\n            Further, other factors that the jury could have taken\n\ninto account in deciding that it was reasonable for Monteagudo not\n\nto report to her superiors included Figueroa's advice to her that\n\nthe matter was \"extremely difficult and quite delicate\" given the\n\npeople   involved,    and     the    fact    that   witnesses      to      the   alleged\n\n\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\fharassment failed to report the sexual harassment as well.7                  In\n\naddition,     there   was   a   significant      age   differential    between\n\nMonteagudo,    22,    and   Arce,   45,   when   the   harassment     occurred.\n\nAlthough Monteagudo was not a minor as was the plaintiff in Reed,\n\nher relative youth compared to Arce bears at least some relevance.\n\nSee id. (noting that a jury could consider the trauma inflicted by\n\na supervisor who was more than double the age of a seventeen year\n\nold whom the supervisor was alleged to have assaulted).                  While\n\nMonteagudo's evidence is not overwhelming, we believe that a\n\nreasonable jury could conclude that her failure to report was based\n\non \"more than ordinary fear or embarrassment\" and was therefore\n\nreasonable.8\n\n\n7\n  Monteagudo testified that Vargas and her colleague, Marilyn Del\nValle-Cruz (\"Del Valle\"), were aware of the sexual harassment.\nAlthough Vargas and Del Valle deny knowledge of the sexual\nharassment, the jury was entitled to believe Monteagudo's version\ngiven the facts surrounding the case.\n8\n   AEELA also maintains that a jury could not reasonably conclude\nthat Monteagudo's failure to file a complaint with her union\npursuant to the collective bargaining agreement was reasonable. We\ndisagree. Monteagudo was advised by Figueroa, a union delegate,\nthat filing a complaint would be futile because the matter involved\npeople that made it \"extremely difficult and quite delicate\"; that\nthe union was weak; and that the union president was friendly with\nVargas.    Furthermore, Monteagudo stated that the union was\nunresponsive to a prior complaint she had filed on an unrelated\nmatter.\n\n     We note here AEELA's claim that Monteagudo did not produce a\ncopy of this prior complaint during discovery, even though AEELA\nhad requested it. AEELA contends that the district court erred by\ndisallowing AEELA to pursue a line of questioning \"directed towards\ndiscrediting Monteagudo's testimony about supposedly having filed\nthe grievance at issue.\" Further, AEELA asserts that the district\n\n                                     -14-\n\f              B.

The Challenged Testimony\n\n              AEELA argues that the district court erred in disallowing\n\ntestimony from Blanca Medina, AEELA's Director of Administrative\n\nand   Legal    Affairs,    regarding   whether   AEELA   had   successfully\n\nemployed a corrective measure in 2005 pursuant to the sexual\n\nharassment policy.         Monteagudo had objected to this testimony,\n\nstating that Medina's testimony on this issue was not \"pertinent at\n\nthis time.\"        Upon Monteagudo's objection, the parties approached\n\n\n\ncourt erred by stating that AEELA had not previously moved to\ncompel the document. We agree with the district court that this\nwas a discovery issue that AEELA should have addressed earlier\neither by way of a motion to compel or a request for sanctions\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c). However, even if we were to decide\notherwise, any error would be harmless as the jury could have\nconcluded that Monteagudo was reasonable in her decision not to\nfile a complaint with the union based on the other reasons\narticulated above. In any event, we are hard pressed to see how\nAEELA was disadvantaged as the district court allowed AEELA to ask\nMonteagudo a series of questions about the document and its\nwhereabouts for purposes of impeachment.\n\n                                    -15-\n\fthe bench and a colloquy ensued between the parties and the\n\ndistrict court.9   This exchange resulted in the apparent agreement\n\nby AEELA to the following instruction given to the jury immediately\n\nafter the bench conference:\n\n           The witness stated that in 2005, certain\n           procedures were followed in another case.\n           We're not going to go into that line of\n           questioning. And so that what she was saying,\n           we're not going to continue further, but let\n           me instruct the jury that the fact that\n\n\n9\n    The transcript of the bench conference reads as follows:\n\n      The Court: I think I should instruct the jury -- she\n      already gave that answer. I should instruct the jury\n      that the fact that in 2005 corrective measures were taken\n      is not evidence of what happened in this case.\n\n      Mr. Martínez-Luciano [AEELA's counsel]: The reason why\n      I'm asking about this is because part of plaintiff's\n      theory as stated today in opening statements . . . [is]\n      that the proceedings in AEELA are not worth following,\n      that they're not effective.\n\n      Mr. González-Muñoz [Monteagudo's counsel]: No. What I\n      said during opening statement was that it was not\n      followed in Michelle's case, and limited myself to this\n      case.   It's not that [AEELA's harassment policy] is\n      ineffective. In this case it was not followed. That's\n      what I said in opening statements.\n\n      Mr. Martínez-Luciano: It's not a theory you're going to\n      pursue in closing arguments?\n\n      Mr. González-Muñoz:     No, no.   I'm here for Michelle's\n      case.\n\n      The Court: I'm not going to strike the testimony at this\n      time. Careful with the question. Whatever she stated in\n      2005 is not probative of what may have happened or not\n      happened in 2002.\n\n      Mr. Martínez-Luciano:    Okay.\n\n                                 -16-\n\f           certain procedures may have been followed in\n           2005, they're not conclusive, they're not\n           probative of whatever may have happened in\n           2002.   So in that effect, in that regard,\n           you're not to consider that statement as\n           probative one way or the other of what may\n           have happened in 2002.\n\n           From   this      exchange,       it    is   not    clear    whether     AEELA\n\npreserved its opposition to the court's evidentiary ruling because\n\nAEELA   consented      to    the        court's    decision      to    give    a      jury\n\ninstruction.10    Assuming that AEELA has preserved the issue for\n\nappeal, however, the district court did not err by excluding the\n\ntestimony on relevance grounds.

In Kolstad v.

Following\n\nKolstad, once a plaintiff has shown that \"the employer acted with\n\nmalicious or reckless indifference to the plaintiff's federally\n\nprotected rights,\" \"she then must establish a basis for imputing\n\nliability to the employer.\"   Rodríguez-Torres, 399 F.3d at 64.    We\n\nhave stated that \"the plaintiff may meet this burden by showing\n\nthat the employee who discriminated against her was a managerial\n\nagent acting within the scope of his employment.\"     Id.   \"[E]ven if\n\nthe plaintiff makes these showings, the employer still may avoid\n\npunitive liability by showing that it engaged in good faith efforts\n\nto implement an anti-discrimination policy.\"    Id.   \"Demonstrating\n\ngood faith compliance is an affirmative defense, and the burden of\n\nproof therefore rests with the employer.\" Id.\n\n          Here, a reasonable jury could conclude that Arce was\n\nacting in a managerial capacity when engaging in the acts of sexual\n\nharassment.    Also, as a supervisor, Arce should have been aware\n\nthat his actions were against AEELA's sexual harassment policy and\n\nfederal law.   A closer question is whether AEELA was entitled to\n\n\n                                -23-\n\fits affirmative defense of good faith compliance, especially in\n\nview of the jury's finding that AEELA had satisfied the first prong\n\nof its Faragher-Ellerth defense.                 The question before us then is\n\nwhether the fact that AEELA had a sexual harassment policy in place\n\nthat was disseminated to its employees was sufficient to show \"good\n\nfaith compliance\" in order to avoid punitive damages.\n\n            We have stated that while \"a written non-discrimination\n\npolicy is one indication of an employer's efforts to comply with\n\nTitle    VII.    .    .    .    a    written       statement,      without    more,   is\n\ninsufficient     to       insulate    an    employer      from     punitive    damages\n\nliability.\"     Romano v. U-Haul Int'l, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771255\"><a href=\"/opinion/771255/karen-romano-v-u-haul-international-u-haul-company-of-maine-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">655</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 670 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).     From our review of the record, AEELA has not provided\n\nsufficient proof that it had in place an \"active mechanism for\n\nrenewing   employees'          awareness    of     the   policies    through     either\n\nspecific    education          programs    or     periodic   re-dissemination         or\n\nrevision of their written materials\";13 \"testimony by appellants'\n\nwitnesses that indicated that supervisors were trained to prevent\n\ndiscrimination       from      occurring;\"        or   \"examples    in   which   their\n\nanti-discrimination policies were successfully followed.\"14 Id.\n\n\n13\n   Notably, Monteagudo testified that she had never been offered\na seminar on sexual harassment and that she was unaware if any\nsexual harassment seminars had been given to her supervisors.\n14\n   We acknowledge that AEELA was rebuffed by the district court in\nits attempt to show how its policy was successfully implemented in\n2005. However, as we noted in assessing AEELA's evidentiary claim\nabove, this evidence was not proffered to show that AEELA should\nnot have been liable for punitive damages. Rather, AEELA attempted\n\n                                           -24-\n\f(providing    a   non-exhaustive   list   of    ways   an   employer   could\n\ndemonstrate good faith compliance).            While having all of these\n\nfactors is not necessary to qualify for the defense, see id., AEELA\n\nhas not provided sufficient evidence that it fulfilled any of these\n\nfactors.     Thus, the district court did not commit plain error in\n\nupholding the punitive damages award and denying a new trial on\n\ndamages.\n\n                           III.    Conclusion\n\n            For the foregoing reasons, the district court judgment is\n\naffirmed.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\nto introduce Medina's testimony in order to bolster its Faragher-\nEllerth defense. This was evidence which the district court was\nwithin its discretion to exclude. Even if the district court had\nconsidered the 2005 corrective measure AEELA had employed pursuant\nto its policy, the district court still did not commit plain error\nin upholding the punitive damages award. This is because AEELA\nfailed to provide sufficient evidence of other indicators of good\nfaith compliance and because the 2005 corrective measure occurred\nthree years after the sexual harassment in this case.
