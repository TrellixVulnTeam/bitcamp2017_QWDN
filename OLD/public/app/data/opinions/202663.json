COLOIAN,\n\n                     Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND\n\n          [Hon. Ernest C. Torres, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                    Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                   Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                   and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Mary June Ciresi, for appellant.\n     Donald C. Lockhart, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Robert Clark Corrente, United States Attorney, and Terrence\nDonnelly, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                         March 20, 2007\n\f          TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.            On April 2, 2001, defendant-\n\nappellant Artin H. Coloian was indicted on charges of bribery and\n\nconspiracy to commit bribery.             The case went to trial and on\n\nJune 27, 2002, Coloian was acquitted of both counts.                 Three years\n\nlater, Coloian filed a motion to expunge his criminal record on\n\nequitable grounds under the original district court case number.\n\nThe   government   responded         that     the     district   court   lacked\n\njurisdiction to consider the motion and that the requested relief\n\nwas inappropriate in any event.           The district court concluded that\n\nit did have jurisdiction to expunge records, but that expungement\n\nwas not warranted in Coloian's case.           After careful consideration,\n\nwe vacate the district court's order and remand for dismissal for\n\nwant of jurisdiction.\n\n                        I.    Factual Background\n\n          On   April   2,    2001,    a     federal   grand   jury   returned   a\n\nsuperseding indictment charging Coloian, an attorney and former\n\nChief of Staff for the mayor of Providence, among others, with\n\nvarious public corruption offenses.             Coloian's case proceeded to\n\ntrial on two counts: bribery and conspiracy to commit bribery.\n\nThose charges were based on allegations that Coloian had been\n\ninvolved in a scheme whereby Vincent A. Cianci, Jr., then mayor of\n\nProvidence, was paid $5,000 for obtaining a job for one Christopher\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fIse.      On June 27, 2002, following a four-day trial, a jury\n\nacquitted Coloian of both counts.1\n\n            On December 8, 2005, more than three years later, Coloian\n\nfiled a Motion to Expunge under the original district court case\n\nnumber in the United States District Court for the District of\n\nRhode Island.2     In that motion, Coloian asked the court to \"expunge\n\nhis    record   with   all   due   dispatch.\"    Coloian   asserted   that\n\nexpungement was warranted on equitable grounds because the \"stigma\"\n\nof having been charged \"is extreme and unusual\" and his arrest and\n\ntrial resulted in impediments to \"his ability to practice law and\n\nbusiness.\"      Coloian also filed a related motion to seal the\n\nrecords.3\n\n            The government filed a consolidated response in which it\n\nchallenged the court's jurisdiction to expunge Coloian's record on\n\nequitable grounds and argued that, even if jurisdiction existed,\n\nthe    requested   expungement     was   inappropriate   given   Coloian's\n\ncircumstances.      In reply, Coloian reasserted his complaints of\n\n\n1\n  During the trial, the district court denied Coloian's motion for\njudgment of acquittal.\n2\n  The word \"expunge\" generally refers to the physical destruction\nof information. Dubnoff v. Goldstein, 385 F.2d 717, 724 (2d Cir.\n1967). With respect to criminal records, expunction refers to the\nprocess of sealing or destroying the record of a criminal\nconviction after expiration of a certain time. U.S. v. Johnson, 941\nF.2d 1102, 1111 (10th Cir. 1991) (citing Black's Law Dictionary at\n522 (5th ed. 1979)).\n3\n   Coloian does not appeal the district court's ruling on his\nmotion to seal.\n\n                                     -3-\n\fstigma and made vague allegations of \"zealous prosecution\" during\n\nthe course of the grand jury proceedings in his case.\n\n             At a February 10, 2006 hearing, Coloian conceded that\n\nnothing in the criminal record had \"disqualif[ied] him for anything\n\nthat he might apply for in the future,\" but emphasized that the\n\nrecord appeared on his credit report, and that he was questioned\n\nabout   it    by    banks,      potential       clients    and   friends.           Coloian\n\nsuggested that he was different from other acquitted defendants in\n\nthat he was a \"practicing attorney\" and \"a member of the business\n\ncommunity,\"        and   as   such,   a    criminal       record      was   particularly\n\ndamaging     because      character       and    reputation      are    of    particular\n\nimportance in his chosen career.\n\n             In     an   oral    disposition,        the    district        court    first\n\nconcluded that \"courts do have inherent authority and inherent\n\ncontrol over their records and can, in appropriate circumstances,\n\nexpunge      records,     but     that    power     should       be    very    sparingly\n\nexercised.\"        The court noted that expungement would be appropriate\n\nupon a showing that the proceedings had been unlawful or invalid,\n\nor the record of the proceeding caused \"extreme hardship\" in a\n\nparticular case.          However, the court found that Coloian had not\n\npresented \"anything even approaching satisfaction of either of\n\nthose criteria.\"\n\n             On appeal, Coloian contends that the district court\n\nacquired and retained subject matter jurisdiction over this case\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fonce the indictment was filed against him pursuant to 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3231.    He further asserts that the district court has ancillary\n\njurisdiction to adjudicate and determine matters incidental to the\n\nexercise of its primary jurisdiction.              Coloian contends that\n\nbecause his motion to expunge his criminal record relates to the\n\ncharges in the indictment and \"remain[s] a public record and record\n\nof   the    District   Court,\"    the   district   court   has   ancillary\n\njurisdiction over the expungement of the criminal records.4             We\n\ndisagree.\n\n                            II.    Discussion\n\n            We review the threshold jurisdictional issue de novo.\n\nSee Baella-Silva v. Husley, 454 F.3d 5, 10 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n\n\n\n4\n   Congress has specifically provided for expungement or related\nremedies in narrowly defined circumstances. See, e.g., 5 U.S.C.\n§§ 552a(d), (g)(1)(C) (allowing claims to amend public records that\nare inaccurate); 10 U.S.C. § 1565(e) (mandating expungement of DNA\nrecords when military conviction is overturned); 18 U.S.C. § 3607\n(c) (allowing for expungement of criminal records in certain drug\npossession cases); 21 U.S.C. § 844a(j) (allowing for expungement of\ncivil penalty records in certain drug possession cases); 42 U.S.C.\n§ 14132(d) (allowing for expungement of DNA records held by the FBI\nin certain cases where conviction is overturned). Also, federal\ncourts have upheld the expungement of criminal records as a remedy\nfor arrests or prosecutions that violate federal statutes or the\nconstitution. See, e.g., United States v. McLeod, 385 F.2d 734,\n738-39 (5th Cir. 1967)(directing the expungement of all arrests and\nprosecutions in the record as a remedy for state's violation of the\nCivil Rights Act); Sullivan v. Murphy, 478 F.2d 938, 960 (D.C. Cir.\n1973) (same, as remedy for government's violation of the\nConstitution).   Coloian does not seek expungement under any of\nthese statutes, nor does he seek expungement as a remedy for the\nviolation of his statutory or constitutional rights.\n\n                                    -5-\n\f          This case presents an issue of first impression in the\n\nFirst Circuit.   The only case in this Circuit to have addressed\n\nthis issue, albeit indirectly, is Reyes v. Supervisor of the DEA,\n\n834 F.2d 1093 (1st Cir. 1987).     In that case, we held that \"the\n\ncourt below did not commit reversible error by refusing to exercise\n\nits equitable discretion to expunge Reyes' files.    That power is a\n\nnarrow one, and has been used more often to expunge records of\n\nunconstitutional convictions.\"    Id. at 1098 (citation omitted).\n\nAlthough this holding assumes that courts are empowered to order\n\nexpungement based on equitable considerations, the question of the\n\ndistrict court's jurisdiction to order the expungement was not\n\nsquarely before the court.       We must now determine whether a\n\ndistrict court has ancillary jurisdiction to adjudicate a motion to\n\nexpunge criminal records based purely on equitable grounds.\n\n          A district court has original jurisdiction over \"all\n\noffenses against the laws of the United States.\"    18 U.S.C. § 3231.\n\nWe have held that \"[o]nce subject-matter jurisdiction has properly\n\nattached, courts may exceed their authority or otherwise err\n\nwithout loss of jurisdiction.\" Prou v. United States, 199 F.3d 37,\n\n45 (1st Cir. 1999).    However, by providing for a deadline for\n\nnotices of appeal from a court's judgment, Rule 4(b) of the Federal\n\nRules of Appellate Procedure \"is a jurisdictional limitation upon\n\nthe powers of the district court after a judgment of conviction has\n\nbeen entered.\"   United States v. Sumner, 226 F.3d 1005, 1013 (9th\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fCir. 2000) (citing 18 U.S.C. § 3562(b); United States v. Dumont,\n\n936 F.2d 292, 295 (7th Cir. 1991)).           Still, a district court may\n\nassert ancillary jurisdiction \"to adjudicate claims and proceedings\n\nrelated to a claim that is properly before the court.\"            Black's Law\n\nDictionary 868 (8th ed. 2004); see also United States v. Dunegan,\n\n251 F.3d 477, 478-79 (3d Cir. 2001) (\"A federal court invokes\n\nancillary jurisdiction as an incident to a matter where it has\n\nacquired jurisdiction of a case in its entirety and, as an incident\n\nto the disposition of the primary matter properly before it.                It\n\nmay resolve other related matters which it could not consider were\n\nthey independently presented.\").\n\n           In Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Insurance Co. of America,\n\nthe Supreme Court shed some light on the contours of a district\n\ncourt's ancillary jurisdiction.            511 U.S. 375 (1994).        In that\n\ncase, the Court unanimously held that a district court lacked\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction to enforce a settlement agreement it\n\nhad approved where its accompanying order of dismissal did not\n\nreserve jurisdiction.      Id. at 378.      In so holding, the Court began\n\nby   reiterating   that    \"[f]ederal    courts    are   courts   of   limited\n\njurisdiction.      They    possess    only    that   power   authorized     by\n\nConstitution and statute, which is not to be expanded             by judicial\n\ndecree.\"   Id. at 377 (citations omitted).           The Court went on to\n\nstate   that   federal    courts'   ancillary     jurisdiction    serves   two\n\npurposes: \"(1) to permit disposition by a single court of claims\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fthat   are,   in   varying     respects   and   degrees,   factually\n\ninterdependent; and (2) to enable a court to function successfully,\n\nthat is, to manage its proceedings, vindicate its authority, and\n\neffectuate its decrees.\"     Id. at 379-80 (citations omitted).\n\n          The Court first noted that the claim originally before\n\nthe district court -- the claim it dismissed -- had nothing to do\n\nwith the claim for breach of the settlement agreement; \"it would\n\nneither be necessary nor even particularly efficient that they be\n\nadjudicated together.\"   Id. at 380.    As such, the district court's\n\nassertion of jurisdiction could not be said to serve the first\n\npurpose of ancillary jurisdiction. Id. With respect to the second\n\npurpose, the Court stated that the \"inherent power\" requested in\n\nthat case -- the power to reopen the case to enforce the settlement\n\nagreement -- was \"quite remote from what courts require in order to\n\nperform their functions,\" given that the district court's only\n\norder in the underlying case was that the suit be dismissed, \"a\n\ndisposition that is in no way flouted or imperiled by the alleged\n\nbreach of the settlement agreement.\"5     Id.\n\n\n5\n   Examples of a district court's proper exercise of ancillary\njurisdiction \"to enable a court to function successfully\" include\nthe power to compel payment of sanctions for misconduct, Chambers\nv. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 44 (1991), the power to fine for\ncontempt or imprison for contumacy, United States v. Hudson, 11\nU.S. (7 Cranch) 32, 34 (1812), and the power to appoint an attorney\nto prosecute defendants for criminal contempt, Young v. United\nStates ex rel. Vuitton et Fils S.A., 481 U.S. 787, 795 (1987). See\nKokkonen, 511 U.S. at 380 (citing also 13 Charles Alan Wright,\nArthur R. Miller & Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure\n§ 3523 (1984)).\n\n                                  -8-\n\f             In   view    of   the    Supreme    Court's   instruction   on   the\n\npurposes of ancillary jurisdiction, we must determine whether\n\nColoian's request for the expungement of his criminal record, based\n\nsolely on equitable grounds,6 serves either of these purposes.\n\n             The Third, Eighth and Ninth Circuits have read Kokkonen\n\nto preclude ancillary jurisdiction over orders to expunge criminal\n\nrecords based solely on equitable grounds.                 These circuits have\n\nrejected the notion that a federal court's jurisdiction under\n\neither   §    3231   or    its       \"inherent    power\"   provides   ancillary\n\njurisdiction over equitable orders to expunge because such orders\n\ndo not fit within Kokkonen's purposes for ancillary jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n6\n   When we refer to \"equitable grounds,\" we mean grounds that rely\nonly on notions of fairness and are entirely divorced from legal\nconsiderations.    Other circuit courts have also emphasized this\ndistinction. See, e.g., United States v. Meyer, 439 F.3d 855, 860-\n62 (8th Cir. 2006) (holding that \"a district court does not have\nsubject matter jurisdiction over a motion to expunge that is based\nsolely on equitable considerations,\" but that it \"may have\nancillary jurisdiction to [expunge] in extraordinary cases to\npreserve its ability to function successfully by enabling it to\ncorrect an injustice caused by an illegal or invalid criminal\nproceeding\"); United States v. Dunegan, 251 F.3d 477, 480 (3d Cir.\n2001) (holding that a district court did not have jurisdiction over\na motion to expunge criminal records based on equitable grounds,\nbut declining to decide \"whether a record may be expunged on the\nbasis of Constitutional or statutory infirmity in the underlying\ncriminal proceedings or on the basis of an unlawful arrest or\nconviction\"); United States v. Sumner, 226 F.3d 1005, 1014-15 (9th\nCir. 2000) (holding that expungement of a criminal record \"solely\non   equitable   grounds, such    as   to  reward   a   defendant's\nrehabilitation and commendable post-conviction conduct\" did not\nserve the purposes of ancillary jurisdiction as articulated in\nKokkonen, and that \"a district court's ancillary jurisdiction is\nlimited to expunging the record of an unlawful arrest or\nconviction, or to correcting a clerical error\").\n\n                                         -9-\n\fSee, e.g., Dunegan, 251 F.3d at 479 (3d Cir. 2001) (\"We do not\n\nbelieve that [the ancillary jurisdiction purposes articulated in\n\nKokkonen] contemplate a petition for the expungement of a criminal\n\nrecord.\"); Meyer, 439 F.3d at 859-60 (8th Cir. 2006) (\"In light of\n\nthe Supreme Court's instruction narrowing the scope of ancillary\n\njurisdiction in [Kokkonen], we are convinced that a district court\n\ndoes not have ancillary jurisdiction to expunge a criminal record\n\nbased solely on equitable grounds.\"); Sumner, 226 F.3d at 1014 (9th\n\nCir. 2000) (\"Expungement of a criminal record solely on equitable\n\ngrounds . . . does not serve [the ancillary jurisdiction purposes\n\narticulated in Kokkonen].\").\n\n            The Second, Seventh, Tenth and D.C. Circuits, however,\n\nhave concluded that district courts do have ancillary jurisdiction\n\nto expunge records based on equitable considerations.7       See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Flowers, 389 F.3d 737, 739 (7th Cir. 2004) (\"The\n\ntest for the expungement of judicial records is a balancing test:\n\n'if   the   dangers   of   unwarranted   adverse   consequences   to   the\n\nindividual outweigh the public interest in maintenance of the\n\nrecords, then expunction is appropriate.'\" (quoting United States\n\nv. Janik, 10 F.3d 470, 472 (7th Cir. 1993)); United States v.\n\n\n7\n   Although the Seventh and Tenth Circuits have not specifically\ntied the district court's power to expunge criminal records to a\nparticular jurisdictional basis, we interpret the silence to mean\nthat the power is grounded on a district court's ancillary\njurisdiction. Cf. Kokkonen, 511 U.S. at 380 (viewing claims of a\ndistrict court's \"inherent power\" as falling under ancillary\njurisdiction).\n\n                                  -10-\n\fSchnitzer, 567 F.2d 536, 539 (2d Cir. 1977) (\"[E]xpungement lies\n\nwithin the equitable discretion of the court, and relief usually is\n\ngranted only in 'extreme circumstances.'\"); Livingston v. U.S.\n\nDep't of Justice, 759 F.2d 74, 78         (D.C. Cir. 1985) (\"It is well\n\nestablished, and undisputed by the parties to this case, that\n\ncourts   have   the   inherent,   equitable   power   to   expunge   arrest\n\nrecords.\"); U.S. v. Linn, 513 F.2d 925, 927 (10th Cir. 1975)\n\n(\"Certain of the cases call for a 'balancing' of the equities\n\nbetween the Government's need to maintain extensive records in\n\norder to aid in general law enforcement and the individual's right\n\nto privacy.\"). However, these cases either predate Kokkonen, or\n\nthey fail to address that decision, which raises questions as to\n\ntheir continued viability.\n\n           We agree with the Third, Eighth and Ninth Circuits that\n\nKokkonen answers the question raised in this case. As the Kokkonen\n\ncourt held, ancillary jurisdiction exists only (1) to permit\n\ndisposition of interrelated claims by a single court and (2) to\n\nenable a court to \"manage its proceedings, vindicate its authority,\n\nand effectuate its decrees.\"      511 U.S. at 379-80.      As in Kokkonen,\n\nthe original claims brought before the district court in this case\n\nhave nothing to do with the equitable grounds upon which Coloian\n\nseeks the expungement of his criminal record. Moreover, \"the power\n\nasked for here is quite remote from what courts require in order to\n\nperform their functions.\"         Id. at 380 (emphasis added).         The\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fexistence and availability of Coloian's criminal records do not\n\nfrustrate or defeat his acquittal.              In fact, the records are\n\nentirely consistent with and respectful of the jury's ultimate\n\njudgment in Coloian's case, as they accurately document his arrest,\n\ntrial and acquittal.        Thus, Kokkonen forecloses any ancillary\n\njurisdiction to order expungement based on Coloian's proffered\n\nequitable reasons.     We therefore find that the district court did\n\nnot   have   jurisdiction   to     consider    Coloian's   request     for   the\n\nexpungement of his criminal record on equitable grounds.\n\n                            III.     Conclusion\n\n             Because   we   find    that      the   district   court    lacked\n\njurisdiction to consider Coloian's motion, we vacate the district\n\ncourt's order and remand for dismissal for want of jurisdiction.\n\n             Vacated and Remanded with instructions to dismiss.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\f",

The government responded that the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider the motion and that the requested relief was inappropriate in any event. The district court concluded that it did have jurisdiction to expunge records, but that expungement was not warranted in Coloian's case. After careful consideration, we vacate the district court's order and remand for dismissal for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Factual Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 2, 2001, a federal grand jury returned a superseding indictment charging Coloian, an attorney and former Chief of Staff for the mayor of Providence, among others, with various public corruption offenses. Coloian's case proceeded to trial on two counts: bribery and conspiracy to commit bribery. Those charges were based on allegations that Coloian had been involved in a scheme whereby Vincent A. Cianci, Jr., then mayor of Providence, was paid $5,000 for obtaining a job for one Christopher Ise. On June 27, 2002, following a four-day trial, a jury acquitted Coloian of both counts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 8, 2005, more than three years later, Coloian filed a Motion to Expunge under the original district court case number in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> In that motion, Coloian asked the court to \"expunge his record with all due dispatch.\" Coloian asserted that expungement was warranted on equitable grounds because the \"stigma\" of having been charged \"is extreme and unusual\" and his arrest and trial resulted in impediments to \"his ability to practice law and business.\" Coloian also filed a related motion to seal the records.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government filed a consolidated response in which it challenged the court's jurisdiction to expunge Coloian's record on equitable grounds and argued that, even if jurisdiction existed, the requested expungement was inappropriate given Coloian's circumstances. In reply, Coloian reasserted his complaints of stigma and made vague allegations of \"zealous prosecution\" during the course of the grand jury proceedings in his case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a February 10, 2006 hearing, Coloian conceded that nothing in the criminal record had \"disqualif[ied] him for anything that he might apply for in the future,\" but emphasized that the record appeared on his credit report, and that he was questioned about it by banks, potential clients and friends. Coloian suggested that he was different from other acquitted defendants in that he was a \"practicing attorney\" and \"a member of the business community,\" and as such, a criminal record was particularly damaging because character and reputation are of particular importance in his chosen career.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an oral disposition, the district court first concluded that \"courts do have inherent authority and inherent control over their records and can, in appropriate circumstances, expunge records, but that power should be very sparingly exercised.\" The court noted that expungement would be appropriate upon a showing that the proceedings had been unlawful or invalid, or the record of the proceeding caused \"extreme hardship\" in a particular case. However, the court found that Coloian had not presented \"anything even approaching satisfaction of either of those criteria.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Coloian contends that the district court acquired and retained subject matter jurisdiction over this case once the indictment was filed against him pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3231. He further asserts that the district court has ancillary jurisdiction to adjudicate and determine matters incidental to the exercise of its primary jurisdiction. Coloian contends that because his motion to expunge his criminal record relates to the charges in the indictment and \"remain[s] a public record and record of the District Court,\" the district court has ancillary jurisdiction over the expungement of the criminal records.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Discussion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the threshold jurisdictional issue <i>de novo. See Baella-Silva v. Hulsey,</i> 454 F.3d 5, 10 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case presents an issue of first impression in the First Circuit. The only case in this Circuit to have addressed this issue, albeit indirectly, is <i>Reyes v. Supervisor of the DEA,</i> 834 F.2d 1093 (1st Cir. 1987). In that case, we held that \"the court below did not commit reversible error by refusing to exercise its equitable discretion to expunge Reyes' files. That power is a narrow one, and has been used more often to expunge records of unconstitutional convictions.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1098 (citation omitted). Although this holding assumes that courts are empowered to order expungement based on equitable considerations, the question of the district court's jurisdiction to order the expungement was not squarely before the court. We must now determine whether a district court has ancillary jurisdiction to adjudicate a motion to expunge criminal records based purely on equitable grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court has original jurisdiction over \"all offenses against the laws of the United States.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3231. We have held that \"[o]nce subject-matter jurisdiction has properly attached, courts may exceed their authority or otherwise err without loss of jurisdiction.\" <i>Prou v. United States,</i> 199 F.3d 37, 45 (1st Cir.1999). However, by providing for a deadline for notices of appeal from a court's judgment, Rule 4(b) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure \"is a jurisdictional limitation upon the powers of the district court after a judgment of conviction has been entered.\" <i>United States v. Sumner,</i> 226 F.3d 1005, 1013 (9th Cir. 2000) (citing 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3562(b); <i>United States v. Dumont,</i> 936 F.2d 292, 295 (7th Cir.1991)). Still, a district court may assert ancillary jurisdiction \"to adjudicate claims and proceedings related to a claim that is properly before the court.\" <i>Black's Law Dictionary</i> 868 (8th ed.2004); <i>see also United States v. Dunegan,</i> 251 F.3d 477, 478-79 (3d Cir.2001) (\"A federal court invokes ancillary jurisdiction as an incident to a matter where it has acquired jurisdiction of a case in its entirety and, as an incident to the disposition of the primary matter properly before it. It may resolve other related matters which it could not consider were they independently presented.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Insurance Co. of America,</i> the Supreme Court shed some light on the contours of a district court's ancillary jurisdiction. 511 U.S. 375, 114 S.Ct. 1673, 128 L.Ed.2d 391 (1994). In that case, the Court unanimously held that a district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enforce a settlement agreement it had approved where its accompanying order of dismissal did not reserve jurisdiction. <i>Id.</i> at 378, 114 S.Ct. 1673. In so holding, the Court began by reiterating that \"[f]ederal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. They possess only that power authorized by Constitution and statute, which is not to be expanded by judicial decree.\" <i>Id.</i> at 377, 114 S.Ct. 1673 (citations omitted). The Court went on to state that federal courts' ancillary jurisdiction serves two purposes: \"(1) to permit disposition by a single court of claims that are, in varying respects and degrees, factually interdependent; and (2) to enable a court to function successfully, that is, to manage its proceedings, vindicate its authority, and effectuate its decrees.\" <i>Id.</i> at 379-80, 114 S.Ct. 1673 (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court first noted that the claim originally before the district court&#8212;the claim it dismissed&#8212;had nothing to do with the claim for breach of the settlement agreement; \"it would neither be necessary nor even particularly efficient that they be adjudicated together.\" <i>Id.</i> at 380, 114 S.Ct. 1673. As such, the district court's assertion of jurisdiction could not be said to serve the first purpose of ancillary jurisdiction. <i>Id.</i> With respect to the second purpose, the Court stated that the \"inherent power\" requested in that case&#8212;the power to reopen the case to enforce the settlement agreement&#8212;was \"quite remote from what courts require in order to perform their functions,\" given that the district court's only order in the underlying case was that the suit be dismissed, \"a disposition that is in no way flouted or imperiled by the alleged breach of the settlement agreement.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In view of the Supreme Court's instruction on the purposes of ancillary jurisdiction, we must determine whether Coloian's request for the expungement of his criminal record, based solely on equitable grounds,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> serves either of these purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Third, Eighth and Ninth Circuits have read <i>Kokkonen</i> to preclude ancillary jurisdiction over orders to expunge criminal records based solely on equitable grounds. These circuits have rejected the notion that a federal court's jurisdiction under either &#167; 3231 or its \"inherent power\" provides ancillary jurisdiction over equitable orders to expunge because such orders do not fit within <i>Kokkonen's</i> purposes for ancillary jurisdiction. <i>See, e.g., Dunegan,</i> 251 F.3d at 479 (3d Cir.2001) (\"We do not believe that [the ancillary jurisdiction purposes articulated in <i>Kokkonen</i>] contemplate a petition for the expungement of a criminal record.\"); <i>Meyer,</i> 439 F.3d at 859-60 (8th Cir.2006) (\"In light of the Supreme Court's instruction narrowing the scope of ancillary jurisdiction in [<i>Kokkonen</i>], we are convinced that a district court does not have ancillary jurisdiction to expunge a criminal record based solely on equitable grounds.\"); <i>Sumner,</i> 226 F.3d at 1014 (9th Cir.2000) (\"Expungement of a criminal record solely on equitable grounds . . . does not serve [the ancillary jurisdiction purposes articulated in <i>Kokkonen</i>].\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Second, Seventh, Tenth and D.C. Circuits, however, have concluded that district courts do have ancillary jurisdiction to expunge records based on equitable considerations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> <i>See, e.g., United States v. Flowers,</i> 389 F.3d 737, 739 (7th Cir.2004) (\"The test for the expungement of judicial records is a balancing test: `if the dangers of unwarranted adverse consequences to the individual outweigh the public interest in maintenance of the records, then expunction is appropriate.'\") (quoting <i>United States v. Janik,</i> 10 F.3d 470, 472 (7th Cir.1993)); <i>United States v. Schnitzer,</i> 567 F.2d 536, 539 (2d Cir.1977) (\"[E]xpungement lies within the equitable discretion of the court, and relief usually is granted only in `extreme circumstances.'\"); <i>Livingston v. U.S. Dep't of Justice,</i> 759 F.2d 74, 78 (D.C.Cir.1985) (\"It is well established, and undisputed by the parties to this case, that courts have the inherent, equitable power to expunge arrest records.\"); <i>U.S. v. Linn,</i> 513 F.2d 925, 927 (10th Cir.1975) (\"Certain of the cases call for a `balancing' of the equities between the Government's need to maintain extensive records in order to aid in general law enforcement and the individual's right to privacy.\"). However, these cases either predate <i>Kokkonen,</i> or they fail to address that decision, which raises questions as to their continued viability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the Third, Eighth and Ninth Circuits that <i>Kokkonen</i> answers the question raised in this case. As the <i>Kokkonen</i> court held, ancillary jurisdiction exists only (1) to permit disposition of interrelated claims by a single court and (2) to enable a court to \"manage its proceedings, vindicate its authority, and effectuate its decrees.\" 511 U.S. at 379-80, 114 S.Ct. 1673. As in <i>Kokkonen,</i> the original claims brought before the district court in this case have nothing to do with the equitable grounds upon which Coloian seeks the expungement of his criminal record. Moreover, \"the power asked for here is quite remote from what courts <i>require</i> in order to perform their functions.\" <i>Id.</i> at 380, 114 S.Ct. 1673 (emphasis added). The existence and availability of Coloian's criminal records do not frustrate or defeat his acquittal. In fact, the records are entirely consistent with and respectful of the jury's ultimate judgment in Coloian's case, as they accurately document his arrest, trial and acquittal. Thus, <i>Kokkonen</i> forecloses any ancillary jurisdiction to order expungement based on Coloian's proffered equitable reasons. We therefore find that the district court did not have jurisdiction to consider Coloian's request for the expungement of his criminal record on equitable grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we find that the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider Coloian's motion, we vacate the district court's order and remand for dismissal for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Vacated</i> and <i>Remanded</i> with instructions to dismiss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> During the trial, the district court denied Coloian's motion for judgment of acquittal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The word \"expunge\" generally refers to the physical destruction of information<i>Dubnoff v.

Also, federal courts have upheld the expungement of criminal records as a remedy for arrests or prosecutions that violate federal statutes or the constitution. <i>See, e.g., United States v. McLeod,</i> 385 F.2d 734, 738-39 (5th Cir.1967)(directing the expungement of all arrests and prosecutions in the record as a remedy for state's violation of the Civil Rights Act); <i>Sullivan v. Murphy,</i> 478 F.2d 938, 960 (D.C.Cir.1973) (same, as remedy for government's violation of the Constitution).

In that case, the Court unanimously held that a district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enforce a settlement agreement it had approved where its accompanying order of dismissal did not reserve jurisdiction. <i>Id.</i> at 378, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117845\"><a href=\"/opinion/117845/kokkonen-v-guardian-life-ins-co-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

As such, the district court's assertion of jurisdiction could not be said to serve the first purpose of ancillary jurisdiction. <i>Id.</i> With respect to the second purpose, the Court stated that the \"inherent power\" requested in that case&#8212;the power to reopen the case to enforce the settlement agreement&#8212;was \"quite remote from what courts require in order to perform their functions,\" given that the district court's only order in the underlying case was that the suit be dismissed, \"a disposition that is in no way flouted or imperiled by the alleged breach of the settlement agreement.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In view of the Supreme Court's instruction on the purposes of ancillary jurisdiction, we must determine whether Coloian's request for the expungement of his criminal record, based solely on equitable grounds,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> serves either of these purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Third, Eighth and Ninth Circuits have read <i>Kokkonen</i> to preclude ancillary jurisdiction over orders to expunge criminal records based solely on equitable grounds.

However, these cases either predate <i>Kokkonen,</i> or they fail to address that decision, which raises questions as to their continued viability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the Third, Eighth and Ninth Circuits that <i>Kokkonen</i> answers the question raised in this case. As the <i>Kokkonen</i> court held, ancillary jurisdiction exists only (1) to permit disposition of interrelated claims by a single court and (2) to enable a court to \"manage its proceedings, vindicate its authority, and effectuate its decrees.\" 511 U.S. at 379-80, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117845\"><a href=\"/opinion/117845/kokkonen-v-guardian-life-ins-co-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1673</span></a></span>. As in <i>Kokkonen,</i> the original claims brought before the district court in this case have nothing to do with the equitable grounds upon which Coloian seeks the expungement of his criminal record. Moreover, \"the power asked for here is quite remote from what courts <i>require</i> in order to perform their functions.\" <i>Id.</i> at 380, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117845\"><a href=\"/opinion/117845/kokkonen-v-guardian-life-ins-co-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1673</span></a></span> (emphasis added). The existence and availability of Coloian's criminal records do not frustrate or defeat his acquittal. In fact, the records are entirely consistent with and respectful of the jury's ultimate judgment in Coloian's case, as they accurately document his arrest, trial and acquittal. Thus, <i>Kokkonen</i> forecloses any ancillary jurisdiction to order expungement based on Coloian's proffered equitable reasons. We therefore find that the district court did not have jurisdiction to consider Coloian's request for the expungement of his criminal record on equitable grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we find that the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider Coloian's motion, we vacate the district court's order and remand for dismissal for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Vacated</i> and <i>Remanded</i> with instructions to dismiss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> During the trial, the district court denied Coloian's motion for judgment of acquittal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The word \"expunge\" generally refers to the physical destruction of information<i>Dubnoff v.
