George A. O'Toole, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                     Boudin, Lipez and Howard,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     James H. Budreau on brief for appellant.\n     Jennifer Hay Zacks, Assistant U.S. Attorney, and Michael J.\nSullivan, United States Attorney, on motion for summary\ndisposition.\n\n\n\n                          November 10, 2008\n\f          Per curiam.      Defendant Grant Boyd conditionally pled\n\nguilty to possessing and conspiring to possess methamphetamine with\n\nintent to distribute, 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 846, and conspiring\n\nto launder money, 18 U.S.C. § 1956.           He appeals the district\n\ncourt’s denial of his pretrial motion to suppress evidence, in\n\nwhich he contended that a Fedex internal security officer had acted\n\nas an agent and instrument of the government when he opened a\n\npackage addressed to Boyd.    Finding no error, we summarily affirm\n\nBoyd’s conviction.    See 1st Cir. R. 27(c).\n\n          In    December   2004,   Boyd    sold   methamphetamine   to   a\n\nconfidential informant who was cooperating with an FBI/DEA drug\n\ntask force. Massachusetts State Trooper Shawn Murray, a task force\n\nmember, learned that a “nervous” Boyd had informed the staff at his\n\nhotel that he was expecting delivery of a package.        Officer Murray\n\ncontacted the local Fedex office, and asked the internal security\n\nofficer Joe Gulley to keep an eye out for any package addressed to\n\nthe hotel.     Gulley intercepted the package before delivery, and\n\nbased on its suspicious appearance (e.g., heavily taped, shipped\n\nfrom a California freight-forwarding office, and addressed to a\n\nhotel, rather than a business or residence), he decided to open the\n\npackage, whereupon he discovered a white powder.        Gulley notified\n\nOfficer Murray, who confirmed that the powder’s appearance was\n\nconsistent with methamphetamine.       Boyd was arrested at his hotel\n\nwhen he accepted receipt of the rewrapped package.             Gulley’s\n\n\n                                   - 2 -\n\fopening and inspection of the package was one ground for the\n\nissuance of a search warrant to search Boyd’s hotel room, where\n\npolice seized further evidence of his drug trafficking.\n\n            After Boyd was charged with drug trafficking and money\n\nlaundering, he moved to suppress both the metamphetamine seized\n\nfrom the package and the other evidence found in his hotel room,\n\nbased on his contention that his Fourth Amendment rights were\n\nviolated because Gulley had not acted as a private party when he\n\nsearched the package, but as an “agent” or “instrument” of the\n\ngovernment (viz., Officer Murray). See United States v. Momoh, 427\n\nF.3d 137, 140 (1st Cir. 2005).            When the district court rejected\n\nthis contention at the close of an evidentiary hearing, Boyd\n\nentered a conditional guilty plea.\n\n            We must affirm the district court’s denial of appellant’s\n\nsuppression    motion      “‘if   any   reasonable    view    of   the   evidence\n\nsupports the decision.’”          United States v. Carrasco, 540 F.3d 43,\n\n49   (1st   Cir.   2008)    (citation     omitted).     The    district    court\n\ncorrectly applied the three-factor standard set forth in United\n\nStates v. Pervaz, 118 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1997), which assesses the\n\nextent of the government’s role in instigating or participating in\n\nthe search, the government’s intent and the degree of control it\n\nexercised over the search and the private party, and the extent to\n\nwhich the private party aimed primarily to help the government or\n\nto serve its own interests.             Boyd’s specific challenges to the\n\n\n                                        - 3 -\n\fdistrict court’s rationale fall short.\n\n           He    first    suggests    that     Officer   Murray    “instigated”\n\nGulley’s search because Gulley would not have located and opened\n\nthe package (which was already en route for delivery) but for\n\nMurray’s tip.     The “instigation” criterion is not satisfied merely\n\nbecause the police have made some prior contact with the private\n\nparty.   Id.    at   5.    Instigation       “properly   means     ‘affirmative\n\nencouragement,’ or alternatively, ‘coercing,’ ‘dominating,’ or\n\n‘directing’ an individual.”           Momoh, 427 F.3d at 141 (citations\n\nomitted); Pervaz, 118 F.3d at 6 (affirming a non-instrumentality\n\ndetermination even though “probably . . . there would have been no\n\nsearch made by COB employees were it not for Agent Barnard's\n\ntelephone call”).         The district court credited Officer Murray’s\n\ntestimony that he merely told Gulley to keep an eye out for any\n\npackage addressed to the Nine Zero Hotel, perhaps with a view to\n\nhis obtaining a search warrant to open it, and that he did not\n\ncoerce Gulley, or even ask that Gully seize or search the package\n\non his own.     See United States v. Espinoza, 490 F.3d 41, 46 (1st\n\nCir.   2007)    (observing    that    the     district   court’s   credibility\n\ndeterminations at a suppression hearing are entitled to utmost\n\ndeference).       Under     Pervaz,   therefore,     appellant’s      attempted\n\nreliance on the cumulative history of similarly non-instigative\n\nrequests from Officer Murray to Gulley also is of no import.\n\n           With respect to the question of Officer Murray’s intent,\n\n\n                                      - 4 -\n\fappellant     again    suggests    that,     given     the   long    history   of\n\ncooperation    between    Officer    Murray      and   Gully,   “a     reasonable\n\ninference could be easily and naturally be drawn that [they] had a\n\ntacit understanding” that Officer Murray intended that Gulley\n\ninvariably would search any package which Officer Murray flagged\n\nfor him.    The district court chose not to draw that inference,\n\nhowever, id., instead crediting Gulley’s testimony that, when\n\nexercising his prerogatives as Fedex’s internal security officer,\n\nhe did not always open and inspect packages after receiving tips\n\nfrom law enforcement, and that he independently decided to open\n\nappellant’s package because it was heavily taped, it had been\n\nshipped by a freight-forwarding office located in California, and\n\nit was addressed to a hotel, rather than a business or residence.\n\nThis evidence undermines the inference that Officer Murray knew or\n\nintended from the outset that Gulley would search the package.\n\n            Finally, appellant suggests that, given the long history\n\nof cooperation between Officer Murray and Gulley, “[t]here is only\n\none   reasonable      conclusion    that   can    be    drawn   from    Gulley’s\n\nextraordinary effort to secure this package: he wanted to assist\n\nMurray in his investigation,” rather than promoting Fedex’s own\n\nprivate interests.       The mere fact that Gulley may have wanted,\n\namong his many motives in seizing and searching the package, to\n\nhelp Officer Murray’s criminal investigation does not preclude a\n\ndistrict court determination that Gulley acted with mixed motives,\n\n\n                                     - 5 -\n\fand that one of those compelling motives was to protect Fedex’s own\n\nlegitimate interests.   See Momoh, 427 F.3d at 141-42 (noting that\n\nprivate carriers have a common-law right to guard against the\n\ntransport of contraband, that “it is likely that the company was\n\nmotivated by more than a desire to comply with FAA regulations,”\n\nand “had a number of potential reasons, notwithstanding the FAA\n\nregulations, to inspect Momoh's package”); Pervaz, 118 F.3d at 6.\n\nFedex paid Gulley to act as its internal security officer, and\n\nspecifically to effectuate its stated policy of preventing its\n\ntransport of contraband.\n\n           The   judgment   of   conviction   is   affirmed,   and   the\n\ngovernment’s pending motion to file an appellate brief is dismissed\n\nas moot.   See 1st Cir. R. 27.0(c).\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 - 6 -\n\f",
