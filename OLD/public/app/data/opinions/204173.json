Douglas P. Woodlock, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Lynch, Chief Judge,\n                Lipez and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Dean Carnahan with whom Law Offices of Dean Carnahan were on\nbrief for appellant.\n     Joshua A. Lewin with whom William A. Worth and Prince, Lobel,\nGlovsky & Tye LLP were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                        February 9, 2010\n\f               LYNCH, Chief Judge.        In July 2006, plaintiff Wen Y.\n\nChiang sued his telecommunications company, Verizon New England\n\nInc. (Verizon NE), in state court, alleging in part that the\n\ncompany had billed his account for telephone service he had not\n\nordered. Chiang filed a second state court suit against Verizon NE\n\nin February 2007 over a billing dispute triggered by Chiang's\n\nconceded failure to pay telephone bills on two accounts, totaling\n\napproximately $200.            Chiang's substantive billing disputes with\n\nVerizon NE were resolved in these state court lawsuits and are not\n\nat issue here.\n\n               In   November    2006,   Chiang   brought    this     suit    against\n\nVerizon NE in Massachusetts federal court, seeking more than $1\n\nmillion for claimed violations of his rights under § 1681s-2(b) of\n\nthe Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), 15 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq., and\n\nunder the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), id. § 1692 et\n\nseq., as to Verizon NE's handling of the disputes resolved in state\n\ncourt.   The district court granted summary judgment for Verizon NE\n\non all of Chiang's claims in January 2009.               Chiang v. Verizon New\n\nEngland, Inc., No. 06-cv-12144-DPW, 2009 WL 102707 (D. Mass. Jan.\n\n13, 2009).       Chiang appeals from the grant of summary judgment.\n\n               In particular, Chiang asserts that Verizon NE, as a\n\nfurnisher of information, failed to adequately investigate disputes\n\nabout    the    furnished      information    reported     to   it   by     consumer\n\nreporting agencies (CRAs), as required under the FCRA.                    15 U.S.C.\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\f§ 1681s-2(b).    He also alleges that Verizon NE was a debt collector\n\nand its practices were abusive, in violation of the FDCPA.       Id.\n\n§ 1692a.     Creditors are generally not liable under the FDCPA when\n\ncollecting on their own accounts, but Chiang asserts that Verizon\n\nNE falls within a limited exception for creditors who collect their\n\nown debts under a name that suggests a third party is collecting\n\nthe account.    Id. § 1692a(6).\n\n             His claims raise several issues of first impression for\n\nour court.    They include whether § 1681s-2(b) of the FCRA provides\n\nfor a private right of action and the standards for asserting a\n\nclaim under that section.     We join other circuits in recognizing\n\nthat under § 1681s-2(b) there is a private cause of action, that\n\nthe investigation must be reasonable, that this test is objective,\n\nand that plaintiff bears the burden of proof.   We further hold that\n\na § 1681s-2(b) claim requires plaintiff to show actual inaccuracies\n\nthat a furnisher's objectively reasonable investigation would have\n\nbeen able to discover. However, we reject the defendant's argument\n\nthat the restriction in an earlier section of the statute, id.\n\n§ 1681s-2(a)(1)(D), which precludes reliance on a plaintiff's\n\nallegations for the purposes of that subsection, applies to a\n\nplaintiff's own assertions in support of his claim under § 1681s-\n\n2(b).\n\n             We affirm summary judgment for Verizon NE on the FCRA\n\n§ 1681s-2(b) claims, because Chiang fails to raise a genuine issue\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fof material fact on two issues on which he bears the burden: (1)\n\nthat   Verizon   NE's   investigation       as   a   furnisher    to   CRAs   was\n\nunreasonable and (2) that there were actual inaccuracies that\n\nVerizon NE could have detected in a reasonable investigation.                  We\n\nalso affirm entry of summary judgment on Chiang's FDCPA claim\n\nbecause there is no material dispute of fact that Verizon NE is not\n\na debt collector.\n\n                                      I.\n\n           When reviewing a grant of summary judgment, we draw all\n\nreasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party \"while\n\nignoring   conclusory        allegations,    improbable     inferences,       and\n\nunsupported speculation.\"        Sutliffe v. Epping Sch. Dist., 584 F.3d\n\n314, 325 (1st Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nChiang's   argument     is    that   the    court    drew   the   wrong   legal\n\nconclusions from the undisputed facts. Accordingly, \"[w]e take the\n\nfacts largely as described by the district court and from the\n\nrecord of the district court proceedings.\"             Boston & Me. Corp. v.\n\nMass. Bay Transp. Auth., 587 F.3d 89, 92 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\nA.         Background: Chiang's Disputes with Verizon NE over His\n           Telephone Service and the State Court Litigation\n\n           The merits of Chiang's disagreements with Verizon NE are\n\nnot at issue in this case and have already been resolved in state\n\ncourt litigation.       However, we outline these disputes to clarify\n\nthe events that triggered the debt collection and credit reporting\n\npractices at issue in this federal case.\n\n                                      -4-\n\f            Chiang is the president of a residential construction and\n\npainting company in Massachusetts, which, Chiang says, also engages\n\nin international trade.       At various points between 2005 and 2007,\n\nChiang obtained telephone service on two lines from Verizon NE, a\n\ntelecommunications company that conducts business in Massachusetts.\n\nDuring this period, Chiang had several disputes with Verizon NE\n\nover his service on both accounts.           How Verizon NE handled these\n\ndisputes is the subject of Chiang's federal litigation.\n\n            The first disagreement involved Chiang's assertion that\n\nVerizon NE charged him from July to November 2005 for long distance\n\nservice on one line that he says he had not ordered.                  Chiang\n\nalleged in his affidavit, but provided no documentation, that he\n\ndiscussed   these   charges    with   a     Verizon   NE   representative   in\n\nNovember 2005 but that the company did not follow through on its\n\npromise to correct his bill.\n\n            A second conflict arose in early 2006, after Chiang\n\ntemporarily switched his telephone service on both lines to another\n\nprovider but continued to receive bills from Verizon NE.              On May\n\n16, 2006, Chiang sent two demand letters to Verizon NE, noting that\n\nhe had switched to a different carrier, effective on February 8 of\n\nthat year, and asking the company to adjust his bill accordingly.\n\n            Chiang switched his telephone service back to Verizon NE\n\nin the summer of 2006. Although his installation was scheduled for\n\nJuly 5, 2006, Chiang claims that Verizon NE did not install his\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fservice until July 13.       On July 18, 2006, Chiang filed suit against\n\nVerizon NE in Massachusetts state court, alleging damages stemming\n\nfrom the delayed installation, as well as from the charges he\n\ncontinued to accrue after switching his service away from Verizon\n\nNE.\n\n          Chiang    asserts     that    Verizon    NE   overcharged   him   for\n\ntelephone service between July and December 2006, billing him for\n\ncalls he did not make and for services he did not order while\n\nfailing to credit him for payments he had made on his account.               In\n\nAugust 2006, Chiang stopped paying his telephone bills on both\n\ntelephone lines.    He believed that he owed Verizon NE nothing and\n\nthat the company instead owed him compensation for the amount that\n\nhe had been overcharged.1\n\n          Chiang's affidavit says he discussed his concerns with a\n\nVerizon NE representative in late August 2006.            In September 2006,\n\nChiang wrote a letter to Verizon NE's attorney, in which he\n\ncomplained about his experience with Verizon NE customer service\n\nand alleged that the representative had told him his service would\n\nbe discontinued if he did not pay his bill.               He also threatened\n\nfurther legal action if Verizon NE continued to \"abuse\" him.\n\n          In      December     2006,      after     providing    notice      of\n\ndiscontinuance,     Verizon     NE     suspended    Chiang's    service     for\n\n\n      1\n          Chiang made at least one partial payment to Verizon NE,\nwhich he explained was meant to cover the fraction of his bill that\nhe did not dispute.\n\n                                       -6-\n\fdelinquent payment.         The company later restored limited service to\n\nhim.       In January 2007, Chiang switched both disputed telephone\n\nlines to another provider.           The following month, he filed a second\n\nstate court suit against Verizon NE for alleged damages arising out\n\nof the suspension and partial restoration of his account.\n\n                The state court suits were consolidated and resolved\n\nprimarily for Verizon NE on its motion for summary judgment.2\n\nB.              Verizon NE's    Debt    Collection     and   Credit   Reporting\n                Practices\n\n                Chiang's federal claims are about the debt collection and\n\ncredit reporting practices of Verizon NE during and after the\n\nperiod of his contested service. We describe the evidence on those\n\npractices.\n\n                1.      FDCPA Claim\n\n                We first review facts related to Chiang's claim that\n\nVerizon NE is liable under the FDCPA.              Chiang alleges that Verizon\n\nNE   was    a    debt   collector,    its   debt   collection   practices   were\n\nabusive, and it attempted to collect its own debts under a name\n\n\n\n       2\n          The state court granted summary judgment in Verizon NE's\nfavor on Chiang's claims for emotional distress and violations of\nthe Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A.\nIt also found that Chiang's failure to show willful misconduct or\ngross negligence meant Massachusetts telecommunications tariffs\ncontrolled and limited damages on his remaining claims.       Since\nVerizon NE had expressed its willingness to compensate Chiang for\ndays when he was without service under these tariffs, the court\nentered summary judgment in Chiang's favor \"on th[e] limited issue\"\nof his \"entitlement to the proportion of service charges he paid\nduring the days he was without service.\"\n\n                                        -7-\n\fthat suggested the debts were being collected by a third party.      In\n\nAugust 2006, Chiang began to receive letters and telephone calls\n\nfrom debt collection agencies seeking to collect on his delinquent\n\naccounts with Verizon NE, which totaled just over $200.3         Chiang\n\nsays that at least one of the collection agencies used profane,\n\nabusive language and called repeatedly, despite his request that he\n\nnot be contacted by telephone.\n\n          The collection letters identified Chiang's creditor by a\n\nvariety of names, including \"Verizon-North,\" \"Verizon North NE\n\n(MASS R),\" and \"Verizon New England Inc.\"      Chiang also claims to\n\nhave received notice from a collection agency and his \"credit alert\n\ncompany\" that \"Verizon Massachusetts, Inc.,\" based in Columbus,\n\nOhio, was seeking payment on his delinquent account.        At the time,\n\nhe believed that \"Verizon Massachusetts, Inc.\" was an independent\n\ncorporation that collected debts for Verizon NE.\n\n          2.      FCRA Claim\n\n          Turning to facts pertinent to Chiang's FCRA claim, in\n\naddition to letters from debt collection agencies, Chiang received\n\ncommunications   from   CRAs,   including   Equifax   and   TransUnion,\n\nreflecting his delinquent Verizon NE accounts. Chiang responded to\n\nthese credit reports with demand letters to the CRAs, in which he\n\n\n\n     3\n          Although the precise amount owed varied in the collection\nletters, the majority of the letters requested payment on Chiang's\ntwo accounts, which were delinquent in the amounts of $119.20 and\n$100, respectively.\n\n                                  -8-\n\frequested that the CRAs remove this information from his account or\n\nlist it as disputed.   Eight of Chiang's demand letters to the CRAs\n\nwere in evidence before the district court.4    While those letters\n\nprovide background, the FCRA claim against Verizon NE is not and\n\ncannot be based on what Chiang told the CRAs.   The claim is instead\n\nbased on the communications from the CRAs to Verizon NE and Verizon\n\nNE's response.\n\n          The evidence about the CRAs' communication with Verizon\n\nNE about Chiang's assertions and Verizon NE's response did not come\n\nfrom Chiang, but from Verizon NE. Verizon NE's undisputed evidence\n\nis that its corporate affiliate, Verizon Services Corp. (Verizon),\n\ncontracts with the Columbus, Ohio-based company Credit Bureau\n\nCollection Services, Inc. (CBCS) for all consumer-reporting related\n\nactivities.      Verizon NE has conceded that, under agency law,\n\nVerizon NE is liable if CBCS violates the FCRA while acting within\n\nthe scope of its contractual duties.   So we review both the actions\n\nof CBCS and of Verizon NE.\n\n          CBCS, Verizon NE's agent, is responsible for initially\n\ntransmitting consumer credit information to the CRAs.       Verizon\n\nsends CBCS information about delinquent accounts every month. CBCS\n\n\n     4\n          Of these eight demand letters, three were addressed to\nEquifax, dated November 24, 2006, April 25, 2007, and May 15, 2007;\nthree were addressed to TransUnion, dated November 30, 2006,\nDecember 4, 2006, and December 16, 2006; and two were addressed to\nExperian, dated November 30, 2006, and December 4, 2006. Only one\nof these letters had been mailed when Chiang initiated his federal\nlawsuit on November 29, 2006.\n\n                                -9-\n\fseparates out accounts whose balances exceed $50 and have not been\n\npaid after sixty days and converts data for these accounts into the\n\ndigital format used by CRAs. It then transmits this information to\n\nthe CRAs.\n\n            The CRAs also notify CBCS, through an online reporting\n\nsystem, when a consumer disputes his credit information.                     These\n\nreports of disputes trigger the protections of 15 U.S.C. § 1681s-\n\n2(b), the statute at issue here.              CBCS then investigates consumer\n\ndisputes by going electronically into Verizon NE's account and\n\nbilling records (to which Verizon has given CBCS access), in order\n\nto determine the accuracy of information provided to CRAs.                    CBCS\n\ncontacts Verizon employees when CBCS is unable to verify the\n\naccuracy    or    completeness      of    a     particular    consumer's    credit\n\ninformation      based   on   the   available       records    alone.      Verizon\n\ndesignates at least one employee to monitor CBCS's credit reporting\n\nactivities.\n\n            The evidence, provided by Verizon NE, is that CBCS\n\nreceived twelve inquiries from CRAs, over about six months between\n\nlate 2006 and 2007, about the accuracy of Chiang's reported credit\n\ninformation through its online reporting system.                        The record\n\ncontains twelve summary reports, recovered from the CBCS system,\n\nthat relate to CRA inquiries about Chiang's account.5                   These one-\n\n\n     5\n          Each of the twelve summary reports contains information\nabout a particular dispute reported to CBCS by a CRA. Information\npresented in each report includes: the name and address of the CRA\n\n                                         -10-\n\fpage reports indicate that Chiang's disputes were described by the\n\nCRAs variously as \"[c]laims inaccurate information,\" \"[c]laims paid\n\nthe original creditor before collection status or paid before\n\ncharge-off,\" \"consumer disputes the balance of this account and\n\nstates account is in [state and federal   lawsuits],\" \"claims that\n\nthis account was never paid late,\" and \"[a]ccount involved in\n\nlitigation.\"   Chiang does not dispute these are the CRA inquiries\n\nat issue, although none of them had been made when he first filed\n\nhis federal lawsuit. Verizon has no record of its personnel having\n\nbeen contacted by CBCS with any additional inquiries regarding\n\nChiang's disputes.   After completing its investigation of Chiang's\n\nreported complaints, CBCS notified the CRAs in each instance that\n\nthe information reported on Chiang's account was accurate.\n\nC.        District Court Proceedings\n\n          On November 29, 2006, Chiang filed suit in the federal\n\ndistrict court of Massachusetts, alleging, inter alia, violations\n\n\n\n\nthat reported the dispute at issue; the dates on which the\nnotification was received and CBCS's response was sent; the\ndisputed account's balance and payment information; a brief\ndescription of \"FCRA Relevant Information,\" that is, the basis for\nChiang's complaint; and the response sent to the CRA. All twelve\nreports indicate that CBCS responded to the various CRAs, \"Account\ninformation accurate as of date reported.\" The earliest report is\ndated December 6, 2006--more than a week after Chiang filed his\nfederal lawsuit--and the last is dated May 25, 2007. Five reports\nare from December 2006, three from March 2007, and the remaining\nfour from May 2007.\n\n                                -11-\n\fof the FCRA and FDCPA and seeking damages.6           We describe specific\n\nclaims below.       On January 13, 2009, the district court granted\n\nVerizon NE's motion for summary judgment.           Chiang, 2009 WL 102707,\n\nat *12.\n\n              In the course of its reasoning on the FCRA claim, the\n\ncourt held that Chiang had the burden to \"identify affirmatively\n\ninformation that a furnisher of credit information could have\n\nuncovered through a reasonable investigation.\"              Id. at *9-10.   The\n\ncourt noted that this circuit has recently announced a similar rule\n\nin the context of CRAs' duty under the FCRA to reinvestigate\n\ninformation disputed by consumers. Id. at *10 (citing DeAndrade v.\n\nTrans Union LLC, 523 F.3d 61, 67 (1st Cir. 2008)).               The district\n\ncourt also ruled that, \"absent any corroborating evidence,\" a\n\nplaintiff's      allegations    of   inaccuracies    were    insufficient   to\n\ndemonstrate information that might have been uncovered.                Id. at\n\n*10.       For this reason, it said, it declined to consider Chiang's\n\ndeposition testimony, affidavits, or demand letters when deciding\n\nwhether he had demonstrated actual inaccuracies that Verizon NE\n\ncould have discovered.         Id. at *11.\n\n\n\n       6\n          Chiang claims that the negative credit information\nrelated to his Verizon NE accounts prevented him from securing a\n$500,000 loan. Although Chiang has never earned more than $59,000\nin a year, he alleges that his failure to secure this loan\nprevented him from participating in an international business deal\nwith a total contract value of more than $200 million. Chiang has\nvariously estimated his lost profits from this missed opportunity\nat $500,000, $8 million, $27.5 million, and $80 million.\n\n                                      -12-\n\f            This appeal followed.\n\n                                    II.\n\n            Chiang's claims under the FCRA and the FDCPA present\n\nseveral pure questions of law, including issues of statutory\n\ninterpretation.    The district court resolved the case on summary\n\njudgment.    Both because these are issues of law and because the\n\ncase is before us on summary judgment, our review is de novo.   See\n\nBristol W. Ins. Co. v. Wawanesa Mut. Ins. Co., 570 F.3d 461, 463\n\n(1st Cir. 2009).    We may affirm the district court on any basis\n\napparent in the record.    Sutliffe, 584 F.3d at 325.\n\n            Although it is true that \"the standards for summary\n\njudgment are highly favorable to the nonmoving party, the nonmovant\n\n. . . still has a burden to produce evidence sufficient for a\n\nreasonable juror to find in his favor.\"   Hinchey v. NYNEX Corp, 144\n\nF.3d 134, 146 (1st Cir. 1998); see also 10A Charles A. Wright et\n\nal., Federal Practice and Procedure § 2727, at 490 (2d ed. 1998)\n\n(noting that although \"[t]he burden on the nonmoving party is not\n\na heavy one,\" the party is \"required to show specific facts . . .\n\nthat present a genuine issue worthy of trial\").

Similarly, our \"indulg[ence of] all reasonable\n\ninferences\" in the nonmoving party's favor is bounded by that\n\n\n                                -13-\n\fparty's obligation to support the alleged factual controversy with\n\nevidence that is neither \"conjectural [n]or problematic.\"               Nat'l\n\nAmusements, Inc. v.

There Is a Private Cause of Action against\n                    Furnishers under the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1681n-o,\n                    1681s-2(b), and the Alleged Breach of the Duty to\n                    Investigate Is Evaluated under an Objective\n                    Reasonableness Standard\n\n             As a preliminary matter, we dispose quickly of the\n\nquestion of whether there is a private cause of action under 15\n\nU.S.C.   §    1681s-2(b),     as   the   question   is   related   to    our\n\njurisdiction. See, e.g., United States v. Hilario, 218 F.3d 19, 22\n\n(1st Cir. 2000) (\"Jurisdictional issues have primacy of place in\n\nappellate review . . . .\").         We also address the meaning of the\n\nterm \"investigation\" in that section, a more recent addition to the\n\nFCRA.\n\n             Congress, recognizing abuses in the burgeoning credit\n\nreporting industry, originally \"enacted FCRA in 1970 to ensure fair\n\nand accurate credit reporting, promote efficiency in the banking\n\nsystem, and protect consumer privacy.\"        Safeco Ins.

The FCRA imposes\n\nobligations on CRAs and users of consumer information and provides\n\nfor enforcement by various federal agencies.        See, e.g., 15 U.S.C.\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\f§ 1681s.      The act also expressly creates a private cause of action,\n\nenabling consumer suits for willful or negligent noncompliance with\n\nits requirements.         Id. § 1681n-o.     See generally Lapine et al.,\n\nsupra § 153.03, at 153-11 to -12; id. § 153.09, at 153-128.\n\nPlaintiffs may recover actual damages for negligent violations, 15\n\nU.S.C. § 1681o(a)(1), and actual or statutory and punitive damages\n\nfor willful ones, id.        § 1681n(a)(1)-(2); Safeco, 551 U.S. at 53.\n\nThere is no basis for any claim of willful violations on this\n\nrecord, so only actual damages are at issue.\n\n              In 1996, Congress substantially amended the FCRA, and\n\nthose amendments are involved here.          See, e.g., H.R. Rep. No. 108-\n\n396, at 1753-54 (2003) (Conf. Rep.). Among the changes adopted was\n\na   new    section    governing     the   responsibilities      of   so-called\n\n\"furnishers\"7 of information to CRAs.           Consumer Credit Reporting\n\nReform Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-208, ch. 1, sec. 2413, § 623,\n\n110 Stat. 3009-426, 3009-447 to -449 (codified as amended at 15\n\nU.S.C.    §   1681s-2).      This   addition   was   intended   to   close   an\n\nidentified \"gap in the FCRA's coverage,\" whereby even dutiful\n\ninvestigations of consumer disputes by CRAs could be frustrated by\n\nfurnishers' irresponsible verification of inaccurate information,\n\n\n\n     7\n          Any person with relevant data about a consumer's\nfinancial activity may voluntarily provide it to a CRA, but \"[t]he\nmost common . . . furnishers of information are credit card\nissuers, auto dealers, department and grocery stores, lenders,\nutilities, insurers, collection agencies, and government agencies.\"\nH.R. Rep. 108-263, at 24 (2003).\n\n                                      -15-\n\fwithout legal consequence to the furnishers.            S. Rep. No. 103-209,\n\nat 6 (1993).    Verizon NE is sued here as a furnisher of information\n\nunder that section.\n\n           Under § 1681s-2, furnishers may not provide inaccurate\n\ninformation to consumer reporting agencies, 15 U.S.C. § 1681s-\n\n2(a)(1), and also have specific duties in the event of a dispute\n\nover furnished information, id. § 1681s-2(b).               Only the second of\n\nthese duties is subject to a private cause of action.                   Chiang's\n\nappeal concerns the latter obligation–-Verizon NE's investigation\n\ninto disputed information.     To understand his argument, we outline\n\nboth provisions of the statute.\n\n           Section     1681s-2(a)      prohibits        any     person        from\n\n\"furnish[ing]    any   information    relating     to   a    consumer    to   any\n\nconsumer reporting agency if the person knows or has reasonable\n\ncause to believe that the information is inaccurate.\" Id. § 1681s-\n\n2(a)(1)(A). Congress expressly limited furnishers' liability under\n\n§ 1681s-2(a) by prohibiting private suits for violations of that\n\nportion of the statute. Id. 1681s-2(c)(1).\n\n           Section 1681s-2(b), the provision at issue in this case,\n\noutlines   a   furnisher's   duties     when   a   consumer      disputes     the\n\ncompleteness or accuracy of information in their credit report.\n\nUnder the FCRA, consumers generally notify CRAs of such disputes.\n\nSee id. § 1681i(a)(1).       Although a consumer may dispute credit\n\ninformation directly to a furnisher, as Chiang has done, the\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fconsumer has no private right of action if the furnisher does not\n\nreasonably   investigate   the   consumer's   claim   after    direct\n\nnotification.8\n\n          When a customer disputes credit information to a CRA, the\n\nCRA must advise the furnisher of that data that a dispute exists\n\nand provide the furnisher with \"all relevant information regarding\n\nthe dispute that the agency has received from the consumer.\"     Id.\n\n§ 1681i(a)(2)(A).   Once notified by a CRA, a furnisher must\n\n          (A) conduct an investigation with respect to the\n          disputed information;\n          (B) review all relevant information provided by the\n          consumer reporting agency . . . .;\n          (C) report the results of the investigation to the\n          consumer reporting agency;\n          (D) if the investigation finds that the information\n          is incomplete or inaccurate, report those results\n          to all other consumer reporting agencies to which\n          the person furnished the information and that\n          compile and maintain files on consumers on a\n          nationwide basis; and\n          (E) if an item of information disputed by a\n          consumer is found to be inaccurate or incomplete or\n          cannot be verified after any reinvestigation . . .,\n          for purposes of reporting to a consumer reporting\n          agency only, as appropriate, based on the results\n\n\n     8\n          The FCRA was recently amended to allow consumers to\nnotify furnishers of disputes directly.      See § 1681s-2(a)(8);\nLapine et al., supra § 153.06, at 153-95. However, there is no\nprivate cause of action for failure to properly investigate such a\ndispute, 15 U.S.C. § 1681s-2(c)(1), and Chiang has not asserted\nthat he complied with the procedures for direct notification. A\nnotice of disputed information provided directly by the consumer to\na furnisher does not trigger a furnisher's duties under\n§ 1681s-2(b). See, e.g., Gorman v. Wolpoff & Abramson, LLP, 584\nF.3d 1147, 1154 (9th Cir. 2009). On the facts of this case, we\nneed not address how, if at all, a consumer's direct notification\nto a furnisher would impact a furnisher's later investigation\ntriggered by CRA notification under § 1681s-2(b).\n\n                                 -17-\n\f           of the reinvestigation promptly--(i) modify that\n           item of information; (ii) delete that item of\n           information; or (iii) permanently block the\n           reporting of that item of information.\n\nId. § 1681s-2(b)(1); see also Lapine et al., supra § 153.06, at\n\n153-96 to -97.     Although a furnisher may choose to contact a\n\nconsumer directly about a dispute reported to the furnisher by a\n\nCRA, \"requiring a furnisher to automatically contact every consumer\n\nwho disputes a debt would be terribly inefficient and such action\n\nis not mandated by the FCRA.\"           Westra v. Credit Control of\n\nPinellas, 409 F.3d 825, 827 (7th Cir. 2005).\n\n           The question before us is whether the act as amended\n\ncreates a private cause of action for violations of § 1681s-2(b).\n\nThe issue, given the exclusion of a private right of action in\n\nsubsection 2(a), is whether to read a similar exclusion into\n\n§ 1681s-2(b), despite the fact that the original statute created a\n\nprivate cause of action in consumers generally. 15 U.S.C. § 1681n-\n\no.   The statute, in our view, creates a private right of action in\n\n§ 1681s-2(b).\n\n           In contrast to the express limitations on private causes\n\nof action under § 1681s-2(a), Congress included no such restriction\n\non violations of § 1681s-2(b).   Moreover, when it amended the FCRA\n\nto include responsibilities for furnishers, Congress expanded the\n\nstatute's private cause of action from allowing suits against CRAs\n\nand users of consumer information to creating a cause of action\n\nagainst \"any person\" who violated the statute. See Nelson v. Chase\n\n                                 -18-\n\fManhattan Mortgage Corp., 282 F.3d 1057, 1060 (9th Cir. 2002)\n\n(\"[W]ho else except furnishers could Congress have had in mind when\n\nit introduced 'any person' into the statute?\").      Furnishers are\n\npersons who could violate   § 1681s-2(b).\n\n          We join the vast majority of courts to have considered\n\nthis issue in holding that a plain reading of the FCRA's text\n\nindicates that a private cause of action exists for individuals\n\nseeking remedies for furnishers' violations of § 1681s-2(b).   See,\n\ne.g., Saunders v. Branch Banking & Trust Co. of Va., 526 F.3d 142,\n\n149 (4th Cir. 2008); Westra, 409 F.3d at 826-27; Nelson, 282 F.3d\n\nat 1060; Gordon v. Greenpoint Credit, 266 F. Supp. 2d 1007, 1010-11\n\n(S.D. Iowa 2003) (collecting cases); see also Lapine et al., supra\n\n§ 153.06, at 153-98 & n.23 (collecting cases).    But see Carney v.\n\nExperian Info. Solutions, Inc., 57 F. Supp. 2d 496, 502 (W.D. Tenn.\n\n1999).\n\n          This leaves the question of the extent of a furnisher's\n\ninvestigation obligation under § 1681s-2(b).    The statute does not\n\ndefine the term \"investigation\" and is apparently intended to give\n\nthe furnisher some flexibility.   We know that the investigation is\n\nmeant to determine if the disputed information is \"incomplete or\n\ninaccurate.\"   Mere incompleteness, however, is not enough; the\n\nincompleteness must be such as to make the furnished information\n\nmisleading in a material sense.       See Saunders, 526 F.3d at 148\n\n(holding that a furnisher may be held liable under § 1681s-2(b) for\n\n\n                               -19-\n\ffailure to report information as disputed when the omission is\n\n\"misleading in such a way and to such an extent that it can be\n\nexpected to [have an] adverse[] effect\") (alteration in original)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).9      We agree generally with the\n\nFourth Circuit's observation that \"[i]t would make little sense to\n\nconclude that, in creating a system intended to give consumers a\n\nmeans to dispute–-and ultimately, correct–-inaccurate information\n\non their credit reports, Congress used the term 'investigation' to\n\ninclude superficial, un reasonable [sic] inquiries by creditors.\"\n\nJohnson v. MBNA Am. Bank, NA, 357 F.3d 426, 430-31 (4th Cir. 2004)\n\n(citing cases interpreting CRAs' analogous duty to investigate as\n\nrequiring reasonable investigations); see also Gorman, 584 F.3d at\n\n1156-57.\n\n           We also hold that the reasonableness of the investigation\n\nis to be determined by an objective standard.        See Gorman, 584 F.3d\n\nat   1156-57.    The   burden   of   showing   the    investigation   was\n\nunreasonable is on the plaintiff.       See Gorman, 584 F.3d at 1157;\n\nWestra, 409 F.3d at 827; Johnson, 357 F.3d at 429-31.\n\n           There is more to a plaintiff's burden of proof.            We\n\nrecently considered what a plaintiff must show in order to carry\n\nhis burden in a related context under the FCRA.         In DeAndrade, we\n\n\n\n     9\n          Here, any claim of incompleteness would be unavailing.\nOn this record, Verizon NE's failure to report Chiang's disputes\nwould not have been \"misleading in a material sense.\"        See\nSaunders, 526 F.3d at 148.\n\n                                 -20-\n\faddressed a plaintiff's suit against a CRA, not a furnisher, for\n\nthe CRA's alleged failure, upon being notified of a consumer\n\ndispute, to \"conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine\n\nwhether the disputed information [wa]s inaccurate.\" 523 F.3d at 65\n\n(quoting 15 U.S.C. § 1681i(a)) (emphasis added).                        We concluded\n\nthat, absent a showing of actual inaccuracy on a reinvestigation,\n\na plaintiff's claim against a CRA fails as a matter of law.                      Id. at\n\n67-68.   In other words, to carry his burden, the plaintiff had to\n\ndemonstrate some causal relationship between the CRA's allegedly\n\nunreasonable      reinvestigation            and    the    failure      to   discover\n\ninaccuracies      in    his      account.     We   hold    that     plaintiffs    suing\n\nfurnishers under § 1681s-2(b) must make the same showing, for\n\nseveral reasons.\n\n             First,     a   primary     component     of    CRAs'    reinvestigation\n\nrequirement, at issue in DeAndrade, is CRAs' obligation to promptly\n\nnotify a furnisher of challenged information of the consumer's\n\ndispute so that the furnisher can conduct an investigation pursuant\n\nto § 1681s-2(b).        See 15 U.S.C. § 1681i(a)(2)(A); see also Gorman,\n\n584   F.3d   at   1156        (\"[T]he   CRA's      'reasonable      reinvestigation'\n\nconsists     largely        of     triggering      the     investigation     by    the\n\nfurnisher.\").          Given the considerable overlap between a CRA's\n\nresponsibility to reinvestigate and a furnisher's duties under\n\n§ 1681s-2(b), it would be inconsistent for plaintiffs to bear a\n\n\n\n\n                                            -21-\n\fweightier burden in suits against a CRA under § 1681i(a) than in\n\nsuits against furnishers under § 1681s-2(b).\n\n           The       text   and   purpose       of   the     statute     support    our\n\ninterpretation. Section 1681i(a) mandates that a CRA reinvestigate\n\nreported information to determine whether the disputed data is\n\n\"inaccurate.\"        Section 1681s-2(b) imposes essentially the same\n\nobligation     on     furnishers    of    information,         requiring     them   to\n\ndetermine if furnished information is \"incomplete or inaccurate.\"\n\n\"The FCRA is intended to protect consumers against the compilation\n\nand dissemination of inaccurate credit information.\"                       DeAndrade,\n\n523 F.3d at 67.        In light of the parallel obligations imposed on\n\nCRAs and furnishers--and the narrow purpose of the amendments to\n\nthe FCRA--that same rationale supports requiring a showing of\n\nactual inaccuracy in suits against furnishers.\n\n           Practical considerations also point to our conclusion.\n\nAs in DeAndrade, it is \"difficult to see how a plaintiff could\n\nprevail   on     a    claim   for   damages\"         based    on    an   unreasonable\n\ninvestigation of disputed data \"without a showing that the disputed\n\ninformation . . . was, in fact, inaccurate.\"                  Id.\n\n           We emphasize that, just as in suits against CRAs, a\n\nplaintiff's required showing is factual inaccuracy, rather than the\n\nexistence of disputed legal questions.                  Id. at 68.        Like CRAs,\n\nfurnishers are \"neither qualified nor obligated to resolve\" matters\n\n\n\n\n                                         -22-\n\fthat \"turn[] on questions that can only be resolved by a court of\n\nlaw.\"    Id.\n\n             Finally,       what    is     a    reasonable      investigation     by    a\n\nfurnisher may vary depending on the circumstances.                      For instance,\n\na more limited investigation may be appropriate when CRAs provide\n\nthe furnisher with vague or cursory information about a consumer's\n\ndispute.     The statute is clear that the investigation is directed\n\nto the information provided by the CRA.                     A CRA's notice informs a\n\nfurnisher      of   \"the    nature    of       the   consumer's     challenge    to    the\n\nreported debt, and it is the receipt of this notice that gives rise\n\nto     the     furnisher's         obligation        to     conduct     a     reasonable\n\ninvestigation.\"        Gorman, 584 F.3d at 1157; see also 15 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1681s-2(b)(1)(B) (requiring a furnisher to review \"all relevant\n\ninformation\" provided to it by a CRA).                      Accordingly, the central\n\ninquiry when assessing a consumer's claim under § 1681s-2(b) is\n\n\"whether the furnisher's procedures were reasonable in light of\n\nwhat    it   learned       about    the    nature      of    the    dispute    from    the\n\ndescription in the CRA's notice of dispute.\"                       Gorman, 584 F.3d at\n\n1157; see also Westra, 409 F.3d at 827.\n\n             If a CRA fails to provide \"all relevant information\" to\n\na furnisher, then the consumer has a private cause of action\n\nagainst the CRA, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1681i(a)(2)(A), 1681n-o, but not\n\nagainst the furnisher.\n\n             We measure this case against these standards.\n\n\n                                           -23-\n\f            2.        Summary Judgment Was Appropriate on Chiang's FCRA\n                      Claim for Two Independently Sufficient Reasons\n\n            Against this backdrop, we hold that summary judgment was\n\nappropriate on Chiang's FCRA claim, since Chiang failed to raise a\n\ngenuine    issue    of    material    fact    that    the   investigation     was\n\nunreasonable and also, independently, because he failed to show any\n\nactual inaccuracies that Verizon NE could have found through a\n\nreasonable investigation.           Chiang has presented no evidence that\n\nthe procedures employed by Verizon NE to investigate the reported\n\ndisputes    were    unreasonable.          Indeed,    Chiang   neither   sought\n\ndiscovery   on     nor   produced    any   evidence    whatsoever     about   the\n\nprocedures Verizon NE, through its agent CBCS, used.                   The only\n\nevidence on this point consists of a Verizon employee's uncontested\n\naffidavit detailing the procedures followed by Verizon NE's agent,\n\nCBCS, procedures which are, on their face, not unreasonable.10\n\nChiang's    failure      to   demonstrate     actual    inaccuracies     in   the\n\nfurnished information that a reasonable investigation could have\n\ndiscovered is a separate, sufficient basis for summary judgment.\n\n            As an initial matter, we reject Verizon NE's argument\n\nthat we should categorically exclude Chiang's affidavit, testimony,\n\nand letters from consideration when deciding whether his claim\n\nshould survive summary judgment.           Verizon NE relies on language in\n\n§   1681s-2(a)(1),       which   prohibits     furnishers      from    knowingly\n\n\n     10\n          The parties do not dispute that CBCS followed                       its\nstandard procedures when investigating Chiang's claims.\n\n                                       -24-\n\freporting inaccurate information to CRAs in the first instance.\n\nThat language, \"[f]or purposes of subparagraph (A) [of § 1681s-\n\n2(a)(1)],\" defined a furnisher's \"reasonable cause to believe that\n\n[furnished]    information     is    inaccurate\"       as    \"having   specific\n\nknowledge, other than solely allegations by the consumer.\"                    15\n\nU.S.C. § 1681s-2(a)(1)(D) (emphasis added).\n\n           To start, the statute's plain language restricts this\n\nprovision to subparagraph (A) of § 1681s-2(a)(1), which reads in\n\npart: \"A person shall not furnish any information relating to a\n\nconsumer to any consumer reporting agency if the person knows or\n\nhas   reasonable     cause    to    believe    that    the      information   is\n\ninaccurate.\"     Id. § 1681s-2(a)(1)(A).        It does not refer to the\n\nsection of the FCRA of concern to us.           Even more, the section of\n\nconcern   to   us,   §   1681s-2(b),   does   not     mention    a   furnisher's\n\n\"reasonable cause to believe,\" nor did Congress otherwise add\n\nlanguage about a special evidentiary rule to subsection (b).\n\n           Absent such clear direction from the statutory text, we\n\nsee no reason to adopt a per se rule excluding a plaintiff's\n\naffidavits, testimony, or letters when considering summary judgment\n\non a claim under § 1681s-2(b).              See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2)\n\n(specifying that summary judgment is appropriate only when \"the\n\npleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any\n\naffidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material\n\n\n\n\n                                     -25-\n\ffact\") (emphasis added).11        As the Supreme Court recently noted in\n\na different context, it is not \"necessary or desirable for courts\n\nto    create   special       burden-of-proof     rules,    or     other   special\n\nprocedural or evidentiary rules.\"             Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Glenn,\n\n128 S. Ct. 2343, 2351 (2008).\n\n            To say that plaintiffs' own allegations are not per se\n\nexcluded does not excuse them from having to meet the normal\n\nevidentiary requirements that they be relevant and competent.                 The\n\nassertions made in Chiang's affidavit and letters are largely\n\nirrelevant to the FCRA claim at issue.              And even accepting these\n\nmaterials at face value, Chiang's unsupported allegations and\n\nunlikely inference raise no genuine issues of material fact.                 See,\n\ne.g., Hoyos v. Telecorp Commc'n, Inc., 488 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.\n\n2007).\n\n            We go back to the relevant evidence.                  Chiang relies\n\nsolely on his own statements that Verizon NE was inaccurate in\n\nreporting he had not paid bills due and owing and his assertions\n\nthat he had discussed his disputes with Verizon NE representatives,\n\nand   he   urges   us   to    infer   that,    as   a   result,    a   reasonable\n\ninvestigation would have revealed Verizon NE's purported awareness\n\n\n\n      11\n          There are, of course, limits on what may be asserted in\nan affidavit at the summary judgment stage. See, e.g., Nieves-\nLuciano v. Hernández-Torres, 397 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"For\npurposes of summary judgment, an allegation in an affidavit must be\nbased on personal knowledge and show affirmatively that the affiant\nis competent to testify to the matters stated therein.\").\n\n                                      -26-\n\fof inaccuracies in his account.         In particular, Chiang cites his\n\naffidavit, in which he details alleged overcharges to his account\n\nand conversations with Verizon NE representatives regarding these\n\ncharges that he says took place in November 2005 and August 2006.\n\nChiang also relies on several letters he sent to Verizon NE.              Two\n\nof these letters are chapter 93A demand letters, dated May 16,\n\n2006–-before    Chiang's    first    state    court   lawsuit–-threatening\n\nlitigation if alleged errors in billing on his two accounts were\n\nnot corrected.    The third, dated September 15, 2006, was sent to\n\nVerizon NE's attorney in the midst of Chiang's first state court\n\nsuit and also threatened legal action if Verizon NE did not correct\n\nalleged overcharges.\n\n           At most, Chiang's proffered evidence would have shown\n\nthat Verizon NE was aware he disputed the claimed amount and that,\n\nas of July 2006, the dispute was in state court.                      Chiang's\n\nallegations are consistent with Verizon NE having reviewed his\n\naccount   and   billing    history    and    confirmed   that   the   factual\n\ninformation, while disputed, was nonetheless accurate. Cf. Gorman,\n\n584 F.3d at 1159-60.      Despite ample opportunity over two years of\n\npretrial proceedings, Chiang neither requested nor produced any\n\nevidence inconsistent with this information being accurate.\n\n           Also significant is that CBCS received only cursory\n\nnotices from the CRAs, which were generalized and vague about the\n\nnature of Chiang's disputes.        The summary reports in CBCS's online\n\n\n                                     -27-\n\ffiling   system    indicate   that   the    information     reported    largely\n\nconsisted of broad, non-specific statements. We take them in turn.\n\n            Two reports said that Chiang \"claims that this account\n\nwas never paid late.\" However, Chiang has conceded that, beginning\n\nin August 2006, he did not pay any part of at least some of his\n\ndisputed bills–-so that cannot be the basis for an inaccuracy.\n\nNor, for the same reason, can two other reports, which indicated\n\nthat Chiang claimed to have \"paid the original creditor before\n\ncollection status or paid before charge-off.\"\n\n            Five   reports    said   that   Chiang    \"[c]laims     inaccurate\n\ninformation,\" which was not in the least bit specific as to what\n\ninformation was disputed.        Finally, several reports essentially\n\nsaid that the consumer disputed the account and the account was\n\ninvolved in litigation, which was true, was not challenged by\n\nVerizon NE, and again, provided no guidance as to either the\n\nspecific    information   that   was   disputed      or   the   basis   for   the\n\ndispute.\n\n            None of these reports alerted CBCS to which of the\n\nallegedly     erroneous   charges    underlying      Chiang's     dispute     was\n\ninaccurate.     Nor did they evidence that a more searching inquiry\n\nmay have been necessary.      See Westra, 409 F.3d at 827 (holding that\n\na furnisher was entitled to summary judgment on § 1681s-2(b) claim\n\nbecause merely verifying that account information was accurate as\n\nreported was reasonable, given \"scant information\" received from\n\n\n                                     -28-\n\fthe CRA); see also Gorman, 584 F.3d at 1157-58.   We repeat that an\n\ninvestigation under § 1681s-2(b) is geared to the information\n\nprovided by the CRA to the furnisher; if the CRA fails in its\n\nobligation to provide \"all relevant information regarding the\n\ndispute,\" 15 U.S.C. § 1681i(a)(2)(A), then there is a claim against\n\nthe CRA but not the furnisher.\n\n           Plaintiff's behavior in refusing to engage in discovery\n\nor provide any information about the reasonableness of Verizon NE's\n\ninvestigation procedures cannot be a shortcut to trial on the\n\nmerits.   The fact that Chiang put on evidence that he told Verizon\n\nNE he disputed various bills does not itself raise a reasonable\n\ninference that Verizon NE, through CBCS, conducted an unreasonable\n\ninvestigation or that the furnished information was not accurate.\n\nThat evidence is not enough. See, e.g., Nat'l Amusements, Inc., 43\n\nF.3d at 735.12\n\n\n     12\n           The district court cited the Fourth Circuit's decision in\nJohnson in support of its determination that a reasonable jury\nmight conclude that Verizon's procedures were unreasonable.\nChiang, 2009 WL 102707, at *9. But several distinguishing factors\nsuggest that Johnson cannot support the weight the district court\nplaced upon it.     First, in Johnson, the court noted that the\nfurnisher's limited investigation could be deemed unreasonable in\npart because the furnisher's inquiry occurred after it had been\nnotified by the CRA \"of the specific nature of Johnson's dispute.\"\nJohnson, 357 F.3d at 431. Verizon NE had no such notice.\n     It is true the court emphasized that the defendant furnisher's\ninvestigation generally extended no further than its own\ncomputerized Customer Information System (CIS), but unlike CBCS's\nprocedures, it apparently never provided for more searching review.\nId.    That was pertinent because the furnisher artificially\nrestricted    the  review   of   its   own   computerized   records.\nInvestigators needed only to confirm \"two out of four pieces of\n\n                                 -29-\n\f            Independently,     we   agree   with    the       district    court's\n\napplication of our holding in DeAndrade to conclude that Chiang was\n\nrequired to present evidence of actual inaccuracies in his account\n\nthat an alternative investigation might have uncovered. He has not\n\ndone so.\n\n            Chiang's affidavit and letters show that he had several\n\ndisagreements with Verizon NE over his billing, which extended into\n\nstate court litigation; Verizon NE does not dispute this.                  Chiang\n\nhas not, however, demonstrated that any of his substantive disputes\n\nwith Verizon NE involved actual, factual inaccuracies in his\n\nbilling that a reasonable investigation could have detected.                     To\n\nthe   extent   that   his   argument   reduces     to   the    claim     that   any\n\ninvestigation that did not accept his allegations as accurate was\n\nby definition unreasonable, it fails.               For this reason, too,\n\nsummary judgment was appropriate on Chiang's FCRA claim.\n\nB.          Summary Judgment Was Appropriate on Chiang's FDCPA Claim\n\n            Summary judgment was also appropriate on Chiang's FDCPA\n\nclaim.     We agree with the district court's determination that\n\nVerizon NE does not qualify as a \"debt collector\" under the\n\n\n\ninformation contained in the CIS--name, address, social security\nnumber, and date of birth--in order to verify [a consumer's]\nidentity.\" Id. at 431 n.3. This truncated inquiry was how the\nfurnisher confirmed to CRAs that their information was accurate.\nId. at 431.    As there is no evidence of similarly restricted\ninvestigation here, or anything else that might raise a genuine\nissue of material fact as to the reasonableness of Verizon NE's\ninvestigation, summary judgment was appropriate.\n\n                                    -30-\n\fstatute.     Chiang's assertions to the contrary are either wholly\n\nunsupported by the record or waived.\n\n            The FDCPA was enacted to protect debtors from abusive\n\ndebt collection practices. 15 U.S.C. § 1692(e); see also Lapine et\n\nal., supra § 155.02, at 155-6.           To that end, it regulates debt\n\ncollectors' tactics and, inter alia, creates a private cause of\n\naction for victims of \"oppressive or offensive collection agency\n\nbehavior.\"    Lapine et al., supra § 155.02, at 155-6.         The statute\n\ndefines \"debt collector\" as any individual in a business whose\n\n\"principal purpose . . . is the collection of any debts, or who\n\nregularly collects or attempts to collect . . . debts owed or due\n\nor asserted to be owed or due to another.\"          15 U.S.C. § 1692a(6).\n\n            Creditors collecting on their own accounts are generally\n\nexcluded from the statute's reach.            Id. § 1692a(6)(F)(ii); cf.\n\nArruda v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 310 F.3d 13, 22 n.4 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).     There is, however, a limited exception for \"any creditor\n\nwho, in the process of collecting his own debts, uses any name\n\nother than his own which would indicate that a third person is\n\ncollecting or attempting to collect such debts.\"          Id. § 1692a(6).\n\nThe   exception   was    designed   to   combat   \"flat-rating,\"    whereby\n\ncreditors attempt to intimidate debtors by creating the false\n\nimpression    that   a   third   party   is   participating   in   the   debt\n\ncollection process. See White v. Goodman, 200 F.3d 1016, 1017 (7th\n\nCir. 2000).\n\n\n                                    -31-\n\f              Chiang claims that Verizon NE violated several provisions\n\nof the FDCPA, including its proscription of \"conduct the natural\n\nconsequence of which is to harass, oppress, or abuse any person in\n\nconnection with the collection of a debt.\"                15 U.S.C. § 1692d.\n\nAlthough Verizon NE is not a debt collector, Chiang urges that it\n\nfalls within the exception for creditors because the company\n\nattempted to collect its own debt from him under the allegedly\n\ndeceptive name \"Verizon Massachusetts.\" Chiang does not claim that\n\nVerizon NE was directly collecting its own debts, but instead\n\nasserts that debt collectors were instructed by Verizon NE to use\n\nthe name \"Verizon Massachusetts.\"             Chiang's argument fails.\n\n              Assuming, dubitante, that the alleged practice would\n\nrender   Verizon     NE   a    \"debt   collector\"      under   the   FDCPA,   we\n\nnonetheless agree with the district court that Chiang's argument\n\nshould   be    rejected   as   a   mere   conclusory     allegation,    utterly\n\nunsupported by the record.         E.g., Estate of Bennett v. Wainwright,\n\n548 F.3d 155, 177-78 (1st Cir. 2008).             On appeal, Chiang insists,\n\nwithout further explanation or citation to caselaw, that the\n\ndistrict court's failure to draw the inference that debt collectors\n\nreceived the name \"Verizon Massachusetts\" from Verizon NE was\n\nerroneous.      His declaration does not make it so.\n\n              Absent any evidence that Verizon NE was collecting its\n\nown debts we need not reach Chiang's argument that the use of the\n\nname     \"Verizon      Massachusetts\"          would    deceive      consumers,\n\n\n                                       -32-\n\funsophisticated or otherwise.          Cf. Maguire v. Citicorp Retail\n\nServs., Inc., 147 F.3d 232, 236 (2d Cir. 1998) (describing the\n\n\"least sophisticated consumer\" standard).           We also do not address\n\nChiang's argument that CBCS's communications with him on behalf of\n\nVerizon NE make Verizon NE a debt collector.           This claim was not\n\nraised before the district court and is waived.           E.g., In re New\n\nMotor Vehicles Canadian Exp. Antitrust Litig., 533 F.3d 1, 5-6 &\n\nn.3 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n                                  III.\n\n            The   district   court's   grant   of    summary   judgment   is\n\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -33-\n\f",

In July 2006, plaintiff Wen Y.\n\nChiang sued his telecommunications company, Verizon New England\n\nInc. (Verizon NE), in state court, alleging in part that the\n\ncompany had billed his account for telephone service he had not\n\nordered. Chiang filed a second state court suit against Verizon NE\n\nin February 2007 over a billing dispute triggered by Chiang's\n\nconceded failure to pay telephone bills on two accounts, totaling\n\napproximately $200.            Chiang's substantive billing disputes with\n\nVerizon NE were resolved in these state court lawsuits and are not\n\nat issue here.\n\n               In   November    2006,   Chiang   brought    this     suit    against\n\nVerizon NE in Massachusetts federal court, seeking more than $1\n\nmillion for claimed violations of his rights under § 1681s-2(b) of\n\nthe Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), 15 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq., and\n\nunder the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), id. § 1692 et\n\nseq., as to Verizon NE's handling of the disputes resolved in state\n\ncourt.   The district court granted summary judgment for Verizon NE\n\non all of Chiang's claims in January 2009.               Chiang v. Verizon New\n\nEngland, Inc., No. 06-cv-12144-DPW, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">102707</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D. Mass. Jan.\n\n13, 2009).       Chiang appeals from the grant of summary judgment.\n\n               In particular, Chiang asserts that Verizon NE, as a\n\nfurnisher of information, failed to adequately investigate disputes\n\nabout    the    furnished      information    reported     to   it   by     consumer\n\nreporting agencies (CRAs), as required under the FCRA.                    15 U.S.C.\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\f§ 1681s-2(b).    He also alleges that Verizon NE was a debt collector\n\nand its practices were abusive, in violation of the FDCPA.       Id.\n\n§ 1692a.     Creditors are generally not liable under the FDCPA when\n\ncollecting on their own accounts, but Chiang asserts that Verizon\n\nNE falls within a limited exception for creditors who collect their\n\nown debts under a name that suggests a third party is collecting\n\nthe account.    Id. § 1692a(6).\n\n             His claims raise several issues of first impression for\n\nour court.    They include whether § 1681s-2(b) of the FCRA provides\n\nfor a private right of action and the standards for asserting a\n\nclaim under that section.     We join other circuits in recognizing\n\nthat under § 1681s-2(b) there is a private cause of action, that\n\nthe investigation must be reasonable, that this test is objective,\n\nand that plaintiff bears the burden of proof.   We further hold that\n\na § 1681s-2(b) claim requires plaintiff to show actual inaccuracies\n\nthat a furnisher's objectively reasonable investigation would have\n\nbeen able to discover. However, we reject the defendant's argument\n\nthat the restriction in an earlier section of the statute, id.\n\n§ 1681s-2(a)(1)(D), which precludes reliance on a plaintiff's\n\nallegations for the purposes of that subsection, applies to a\n\nplaintiff's own assertions in support of his claim under § 1681s-\n\n2(b).\n\n             We affirm summary judgment for Verizon NE on the FCRA\n\n§ 1681s-2(b) claims, because Chiang fails to raise a genuine issue\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fof material fact on two issues on which he bears the burden: (1)\n\nthat   Verizon   NE's   investigation       as   a   furnisher    to   CRAs   was\n\nunreasonable and (2) that there were actual inaccuracies that\n\nVerizon NE could have detected in a reasonable investigation.                  We\n\nalso affirm entry of summary judgment on Chiang's FDCPA claim\n\nbecause there is no material dispute of fact that Verizon NE is not\n\na debt collector.\n\n                                      I.\n\n           When reviewing a grant of summary judgment, we draw all\n\nreasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party \"while\n\nignoring   conclusory        allegations,    improbable     inferences,       and\n\nunsupported speculation.\"        Sutliffe v.

Background: Chiang's Disputes with Verizon NE over His\n           Telephone Service and the State Court Litigation\n\n           The merits of Chiang's disagreements with Verizon NE are\n\nnot at issue in this case and have already been resolved in state\n\ncourt litigation.       However, we outline these disputes to clarify\n\nthe events that triggered the debt collection and credit reporting\n\npractices at issue in this federal case.\n\n                                      -4-\n\f            Chiang is the president of a residential construction and\n\npainting company in Massachusetts, which, Chiang says, also engages\n\nin international trade.       At various points between 2005 and 2007,\n\nChiang obtained telephone service on two lines from Verizon NE, a\n\ntelecommunications company that conducts business in Massachusetts.\n\nDuring this period, Chiang had several disputes with Verizon NE\n\nover his service on both accounts.           How Verizon NE handled these\n\ndisputes is the subject of Chiang's federal litigation.\n\n            The first disagreement involved Chiang's assertion that\n\nVerizon NE charged him from July to November 2005 for long distance\n\nservice on one line that he says he had not ordered.                  Chiang\n\nalleged in his affidavit, but provided no documentation, that he\n\ndiscussed   these   charges    with   a     Verizon   NE   representative   in\n\nNovember 2005 but that the company did not follow through on its\n\npromise to correct his bill.\n\n            A second conflict arose in early 2006, after Chiang\n\ntemporarily switched his telephone service on both lines to another\n\nprovider but continued to receive bills from Verizon NE.              On May\n\n16, 2006, Chiang sent two demand letters to Verizon NE, noting that\n\nhe had switched to a different carrier, effective on February 8 of\n\nthat year, and asking the company to adjust his bill accordingly.\n\n            Chiang switched his telephone service back to Verizon NE\n\nin the summer of 2006. Although his installation was scheduled for\n\nJuly 5, 2006, Chiang claims that Verizon NE did not install his\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fservice until July 13.       On July 18, 2006, Chiang filed suit against\n\nVerizon NE in Massachusetts state court, alleging damages stemming\n\nfrom the delayed installation, as well as from the charges he\n\ncontinued to accrue after switching his service away from Verizon\n\nNE.\n\n          Chiang    asserts     that    Verizon    NE   overcharged   him   for\n\ntelephone service between July and December 2006, billing him for\n\ncalls he did not make and for services he did not order while\n\nfailing to credit him for payments he had made on his account.               In\n\nAugust 2006, Chiang stopped paying his telephone bills on both\n\ntelephone lines.    He believed that he owed Verizon NE nothing and\n\nthat the company instead owed him compensation for the amount that\n\nhe had been overcharged.1\n\n          Chiang's affidavit says he discussed his concerns with a\n\nVerizon NE representative in late August 2006.            In September 2006,\n\nChiang wrote a letter to Verizon NE's attorney, in which he\n\ncomplained about his experience with Verizon NE customer service\n\nand alleged that the representative had told him his service would\n\nbe discontinued if he did not pay his bill.               He also threatened\n\nfurther legal action if Verizon NE continued to \"abuse\" him.\n\n          In      December     2006,      after     providing    notice      of\n\ndiscontinuance,     Verizon     NE     suspended    Chiang's    service     for\n\n\n      1\n          Chiang made at least one partial payment to Verizon NE,\nwhich he explained was meant to cover the fraction of his bill that\nhe did not dispute.\n\n                                       -6-\n\fdelinquent payment.         The company later restored limited service to\n\nhim.       In January 2007, Chiang switched both disputed telephone\n\nlines to another provider.           The following month, he filed a second\n\nstate court suit against Verizon NE for alleged damages arising out\n\nof the suspension and partial restoration of his account.\n\n                The state court suits were consolidated and resolved\n\nprimarily for Verizon NE on its motion for summary judgment.2\n\nB.              Verizon NE's    Debt    Collection     and   Credit   Reporting\n                Practices\n\n                Chiang's federal claims are about the debt collection and\n\ncredit reporting practices of Verizon NE during and after the\n\nperiod of his contested service. We describe the evidence on those\n\npractices.\n\n                1.      FDCPA Claim\n\n                We first review facts related to Chiang's claim that\n\nVerizon NE is liable under the FDCPA.              Chiang alleges that Verizon\n\nNE   was    a    debt   collector,    its   debt   collection   practices   were\n\nabusive, and it attempted to collect its own debts under a name\n\n\n\n       2\n          The state court granted summary judgment in Verizon NE's\nfavor on Chiang's claims for emotional distress and violations of\nthe Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A.\nIt also found that Chiang's failure to show willful misconduct or\ngross negligence meant Massachusetts telecommunications tariffs\ncontrolled and limited damages on his remaining claims.       Since\nVerizon NE had expressed its willingness to compensate Chiang for\ndays when he was without service under these tariffs, the court\nentered summary judgment in Chiang's favor \"on th[e] limited issue\"\nof his \"entitlement to the proportion of service charges he paid\nduring the days he was without service.\"\n\n                                        -7-\n\fthat suggested the debts were being collected by a third party.      In\n\nAugust 2006, Chiang began to receive letters and telephone calls\n\nfrom debt collection agencies seeking to collect on his delinquent\n\naccounts with Verizon NE, which totaled just over $200.3         Chiang\n\nsays that at least one of the collection agencies used profane,\n\nabusive language and called repeatedly, despite his request that he\n\nnot be contacted by telephone.\n\n          The collection letters identified Chiang's creditor by a\n\nvariety of names, including \"Verizon-North,\" \"Verizon North NE\n\n(MASS R),\" and \"Verizon New England Inc.\"      Chiang also claims to\n\nhave received notice from a collection agency and his \"credit alert\n\ncompany\" that \"Verizon Massachusetts, Inc.,\" based in Columbus,\n\nOhio, was seeking payment on his delinquent account.        At the time,\n\nhe believed that \"Verizon Massachusetts, Inc.\" was an independent\n\ncorporation that collected debts for Verizon NE.\n\n          2.      FCRA Claim\n\n          Turning to facts pertinent to Chiang's FCRA claim, in\n\naddition to letters from debt collection agencies, Chiang received\n\ncommunications   from   CRAs,   including   Equifax   and   TransUnion,\n\nreflecting his delinquent Verizon NE accounts. Chiang responded to\n\nthese credit reports with demand letters to the CRAs, in which he\n\n\n\n     3\n          Although the precise amount owed varied in the collection\nletters, the majority of the letters requested payment on Chiang's\ntwo accounts, which were delinquent in the amounts of $119.20 and\n$100, respectively.\n\n                                  -8-\n\frequested that the CRAs remove this information from his account or\n\nlist it as disputed.   Eight of Chiang's demand letters to the CRAs\n\nwere in evidence before the district court.4    While those letters\n\nprovide background, the FCRA claim against Verizon NE is not and\n\ncannot be based on what Chiang told the CRAs.   The claim is instead\n\nbased on the communications from the CRAs to Verizon NE and Verizon\n\nNE's response.\n\n          The evidence about the CRAs' communication with Verizon\n\nNE about Chiang's assertions and Verizon NE's response did not come\n\nfrom Chiang, but from Verizon NE. Verizon NE's undisputed evidence\n\nis that its corporate affiliate, Verizon Services Corp. (Verizon),\n\ncontracts with the Columbus, Ohio-based company Credit Bureau\n\nCollection Services, Inc. (CBCS) for all consumer-reporting related\n\nactivities.      Verizon NE has conceded that, under agency law,\n\nVerizon NE is liable if CBCS violates the FCRA while acting within\n\nthe scope of its contractual duties.   So we review both the actions\n\nof CBCS and of Verizon NE.\n\n          CBCS, Verizon NE's agent, is responsible for initially\n\ntransmitting consumer credit information to the CRAs.       Verizon\n\nsends CBCS information about delinquent accounts every month. CBCS\n\n\n     4\n          Of these eight demand letters, three were addressed to\nEquifax, dated November 24, 2006, April 25, 2007, and May 15, 2007;\nthree were addressed to TransUnion, dated November 30, 2006,\nDecember 4, 2006, and December 16, 2006; and two were addressed to\nExperian, dated November 30, 2006, and December 4, 2006. Only one\nof these letters had been mailed when Chiang initiated his federal\nlawsuit on November 29, 2006.\n\n                                -9-\n\fseparates out accounts whose balances exceed $50 and have not been\n\npaid after sixty days and converts data for these accounts into the\n\ndigital format used by CRAs. It then transmits this information to\n\nthe CRAs.\n\n            The CRAs also notify CBCS, through an online reporting\n\nsystem, when a consumer disputes his credit information.                     These\n\nreports of disputes trigger the protections of 15 U.S.C. § 1681s-\n\n2(b), the statute at issue here.              CBCS then investigates consumer\n\ndisputes by going electronically into Verizon NE's account and\n\nbilling records (to which Verizon has given CBCS access), in order\n\nto determine the accuracy of information provided to CRAs.                    CBCS\n\ncontacts Verizon employees when CBCS is unable to verify the\n\naccuracy    or    completeness      of    a     particular    consumer's    credit\n\ninformation      based   on   the   available       records    alone.      Verizon\n\ndesignates at least one employee to monitor CBCS's credit reporting\n\nactivities.\n\n            The evidence, provided by Verizon NE, is that CBCS\n\nreceived twelve inquiries from CRAs, over about six months between\n\nlate 2006 and 2007, about the accuracy of Chiang's reported credit\n\ninformation through its online reporting system.                        The record\n\ncontains twelve summary reports, recovered from the CBCS system,\n\nthat relate to CRA inquiries about Chiang's account.5                   These one-\n\n\n     5\n          Each of the twelve summary reports contains information\nabout a particular dispute reported to CBCS by a CRA. Information\npresented in each report includes: the name and address of the CRA\n\n                                         -10-\n\fpage reports indicate that Chiang's disputes were described by the\n\nCRAs variously as \"[c]laims inaccurate information,\" \"[c]laims paid\n\nthe original creditor before collection status or paid before\n\ncharge-off,\" \"consumer disputes the balance of this account and\n\nstates account is in [state and federal   lawsuits],\" \"claims that\n\nthis account was never paid late,\" and \"[a]ccount involved in\n\nlitigation.\"   Chiang does not dispute these are the CRA inquiries\n\nat issue, although none of them had been made when he first filed\n\nhis federal lawsuit. Verizon has no record of its personnel having\n\nbeen contacted by CBCS with any additional inquiries regarding\n\nChiang's disputes.   After completing its investigation of Chiang's\n\nreported complaints, CBCS notified the CRAs in each instance that\n\nthe information reported on Chiang's account was accurate.\n\nC.        District Court Proceedings\n\n          On November 29, 2006, Chiang filed suit in the federal\n\ndistrict court of Massachusetts, alleging, inter alia, violations\n\n\n\n\nthat reported the dispute at issue; the dates on which the\nnotification was received and CBCS's response was sent; the\ndisputed account's balance and payment information; a brief\ndescription of \"FCRA Relevant Information,\" that is, the basis for\nChiang's complaint; and the response sent to the CRA. All twelve\nreports indicate that CBCS responded to the various CRAs, \"Account\ninformation accurate as of date reported.\" The earliest report is\ndated December 6, 2006--more than a week after Chiang filed his\nfederal lawsuit--and the last is dated May 25, 2007. Five reports\nare from December 2006, three from March 2007, and the remaining\nfour from May 2007.\n\n                                -11-\n\fof the FCRA and FDCPA and seeking damages.6           We describe specific\n\nclaims below.       On January 13, 2009, the district court granted\n\nVerizon NE's motion for summary judgment.           Chiang, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">102707</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\nat *12.\n\n              In the course of its reasoning on the FCRA claim, the\n\ncourt held that Chiang had the burden to \"identify affirmatively\n\ninformation that a furnisher of credit information could have\n\nuncovered through a reasonable investigation.\"              Id. at *9-10.   The\n\ncourt noted that this circuit has recently announced a similar rule\n\nin the context of CRAs' duty under the FCRA to reinvestigate\n\ninformation disputed by consumers. Id. at *10 (citing DeAndrade v.\n\nTrans Union LLC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203243\"><a href=\"/opinion/203243/deandrade-v-trans-union-llc/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">61</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 67 (1st Cir. 2008)).               The district\n\ncourt also ruled that, \"absent any corroborating evidence,\" a\n\nplaintiff's      allegations    of   inaccuracies    were    insufficient   to\n\ndemonstrate information that might have been uncovered.                Id. at\n\n*10.       For this reason, it said, it declined to consider Chiang's\n\ndeposition testimony, affidavits, or demand letters when deciding\n\nwhether he had demonstrated actual inaccuracies that Verizon NE\n\ncould have discovered.         Id. at *11.\n\n\n\n       6\n          Chiang claims that the negative credit information\nrelated to his Verizon NE accounts prevented him from securing a\n$500,000 loan. Although Chiang has never earned more than $59,000\nin a year, he alleges that his failure to secure this loan\nprevented him from participating in an international business deal\nwith a total contract value of more than $200 million. Chiang has\nvariously estimated his lost profits from this missed opportunity\nat $500,000, $8 million, $27.5 million, and $80 million.\n\n                                      -12-\n\f            This appeal followed.\n\n                                    II.\n\n            Chiang's claims under the FCRA and the FDCPA present\n\nseveral pure questions of law, including issues of statutory\n\ninterpretation.    The district court resolved the case on summary\n\njudgment.    Both because these are issues of law and because the\n\ncase is before us on summary judgment, our review is de novo.

Verizon NE is sued here as a furnisher of information\n\nunder that section.\n\n           Under § 1681s-2, furnishers may not provide inaccurate\n\ninformation to consumer reporting agencies, 15 U.S.C. § 1681s-\n\n2(a)(1), and also have specific duties in the event of a dispute\n\nover furnished information, id. § 1681s-2(b).               Only the second of\n\nthese duties is subject to a private cause of action.                   Chiang's\n\nappeal concerns the latter obligation–-Verizon NE's investigation\n\ninto disputed information.     To understand his argument, we outline\n\nboth provisions of the statute.\n\n           Section     1681s-2(a)      prohibits        any     person        from\n\n\"furnish[ing]    any   information    relating     to   a    consumer    to   any\n\nconsumer reporting agency if the person knows or has reasonable\n\ncause to believe that the information is inaccurate.\" Id. § 1681s-\n\n2(a)(1)(A). Congress expressly limited furnishers' liability under\n\n§ 1681s-2(a) by prohibiting private suits for violations of that\n\nportion of the statute. Id. 1681s-2(c)(1).\n\n           Section 1681s-2(b), the provision at issue in this case,\n\noutlines   a   furnisher's   duties     when   a   consumer      disputes     the\n\ncompleteness or accuracy of information in their credit report.\n\nUnder the FCRA, consumers generally notify CRAs of such disputes.\n\nSee id. § 1681i(a)(1).       Although a consumer may dispute credit\n\ninformation directly to a furnisher, as Chiang has done, the\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fconsumer has no private right of action if the furnisher does not\n\nreasonably   investigate   the   consumer's   claim   after    direct\n\nnotification.8\n\n          When a customer disputes credit information to a CRA, the\n\nCRA must advise the furnisher of that data that a dispute exists\n\nand provide the furnisher with \"all relevant information regarding\n\nthe dispute that the agency has received from the consumer.\"     Id.\n\n§ 1681i(a)(2)(A).   Once notified by a CRA, a furnisher must\n\n          (A) conduct an investigation with respect to the\n          disputed information;\n          (B) review all relevant information provided by the\n          consumer reporting agency . . . .;\n          (C) report the results of the investigation to the\n          consumer reporting agency;\n          (D) if the investigation finds that the information\n          is incomplete or inaccurate, report those results\n          to all other consumer reporting agencies to which\n          the person furnished the information and that\n          compile and maintain files on consumers on a\n          nationwide basis; and\n          (E) if an item of information disputed by a\n          consumer is found to be inaccurate or incomplete or\n          cannot be verified after any reinvestigation . . .,\n          for purposes of reporting to a consumer reporting\n          agency only, as appropriate, based on the results\n\n\n     8\n          The FCRA was recently amended to allow consumers to\nnotify furnishers of disputes directly.      See § 1681s-2(a)(8);\nLapine et al., supra § 153.06, at 153-95. However, there is no\nprivate cause of action for failure to properly investigate such a\ndispute, 15 U.S.C. § 1681s-2(c)(1), and Chiang has not asserted\nthat he complied with the procedures for direct notification. A\nnotice of disputed information provided directly by the consumer to\na furnisher does not trigger a furnisher's duties under\n§ 1681s-2(b). See, e.g., Gorman v.

The statute does not\n\ndefine the term \"investigation\" and is apparently intended to give\n\nthe furnisher some flexibility.   We know that the investigation is\n\nmeant to determine if the disputed information is \"incomplete or\n\ninaccurate.\"   Mere incompleteness, however, is not enough; the\n\nincompleteness must be such as to make the furnished information\n\nmisleading in a material sense.       See Saunders, 526 F.3d at 148\n\n(holding that a furnisher may be held liable under § 1681s-2(b) for\n\n\n                               -19-\n\ffailure to report information as disputed when the omission is\n\n\"misleading in such a way and to such an extent that it can be\n\nexpected to [have an] adverse[] effect\") (alteration in original)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).9      We agree generally with the\n\nFourth Circuit's observation that \"[i]t would make little sense to\n\nconclude that, in creating a system intended to give consumers a\n\nmeans to dispute–-and ultimately, correct–-inaccurate information\n\non their credit reports, Congress used the term 'investigation' to\n\ninclude superficial, un reasonable [sic] inquiries by creditors.\"\n\nJohnson v.

See Gorman, 584 F.3d\n\nat   1156-57.    The   burden   of   showing   the    investigation   was\n\nunreasonable is on the plaintiff.       See Gorman, 584 F.3d at 1157;\n\nWestra, 409 F.3d at 827; Johnson, 357 F.3d at 429-31.\n\n           There is more to a plaintiff's burden of proof.            We\n\nrecently considered what a plaintiff must show in order to carry\n\nhis burden in a related context under the FCRA.         In DeAndrade, we\n\n\n\n     9\n          Here, any claim of incompleteness would be unavailing.\nOn this record, Verizon NE's failure to report Chiang's disputes\nwould not have been \"misleading in a material sense.\"        See\nSaunders, 526 F.3d at 148.\n\n                                 -20-\n\faddressed a plaintiff's suit against a CRA, not a furnisher, for\n\nthe CRA's alleged failure, upon being notified of a consumer\n\ndispute, to \"conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine\n\nwhether the disputed information [wa]s inaccurate.\" 523 F.3d at 65\n\n(quoting 15 U.S.C. § 1681i(a)) (emphasis added).                        We concluded\n\nthat, absent a showing of actual inaccuracy on a reinvestigation,\n\na plaintiff's claim against a CRA fails as a matter of law.                      Id. at\n\n67-68.   In other words, to carry his burden, the plaintiff had to\n\ndemonstrate some causal relationship between the CRA's allegedly\n\nunreasonable      reinvestigation            and    the    failure      to   discover\n\ninaccuracies      in    his      account.     We   hold    that     plaintiffs    suing\n\nfurnishers under § 1681s-2(b) must make the same showing, for\n\nseveral reasons.\n\n             First,     a   primary     component     of    CRAs'    reinvestigation\n\nrequirement, at issue in DeAndrade, is CRAs' obligation to promptly\n\nnotify a furnisher of challenged information of the consumer's\n\ndispute so that the furnisher can conduct an investigation pursuant\n\nto § 1681s-2(b).        See 15 U.S.C. § 1681i(a)(2)(A); see also Gorman,\n\n584   F.3d   at   1156        (\"[T]he   CRA's      'reasonable      reinvestigation'\n\nconsists     largely        of     triggering      the     investigation     by    the\n\nfurnisher.\").          Given the considerable overlap between a CRA's\n\nresponsibility to reinvestigate and a furnisher's duties under\n\n§ 1681s-2(b), it would be inconsistent for plaintiffs to bear a\n\n\n\n\n                                            -21-\n\fweightier burden in suits against a CRA under § 1681i(a) than in\n\nsuits against furnishers under § 1681s-2(b).\n\n           The       text   and   purpose       of   the     statute     support    our\n\ninterpretation. Section 1681i(a) mandates that a CRA reinvestigate\n\nreported information to determine whether the disputed data is\n\n\"inaccurate.\"        Section 1681s-2(b) imposes essentially the same\n\nobligation     on     furnishers    of    information,         requiring     them   to\n\ndetermine if furnished information is \"incomplete or inaccurate.\"\n\n\"The FCRA is intended to protect consumers against the compilation\n\nand dissemination of inaccurate credit information.\"                       DeAndrade,\n\n523 F.3d at 67.        In light of the parallel obligations imposed on\n\nCRAs and furnishers--and the narrow purpose of the amendments to\n\nthe FCRA--that same rationale supports requiring a showing of\n\nactual inaccuracy in suits against furnishers.\n\n           Practical considerations also point to our conclusion.\n\nAs in DeAndrade, it is \"difficult to see how a plaintiff could\n\nprevail   on     a    claim   for   damages\"         based    on    an   unreasonable\n\ninvestigation of disputed data \"without a showing that the disputed\n\ninformation . . . was, in fact, inaccurate.\"                  Id.\n\n           We emphasize that, just as in suits against CRAs, a\n\nplaintiff's required showing is factual inaccuracy, rather than the\n\nexistence of disputed legal questions.                  Id. at 68.        Like CRAs,\n\nfurnishers are \"neither qualified nor obligated to resolve\" matters\n\n\n\n\n                                         -22-\n\fthat \"turn[] on questions that can only be resolved by a court of\n\nlaw.\"    Id.\n\n             Finally,       what    is     a    reasonable      investigation     by    a\n\nfurnisher may vary depending on the circumstances.                      For instance,\n\na more limited investigation may be appropriate when CRAs provide\n\nthe furnisher with vague or cursory information about a consumer's\n\ndispute.     The statute is clear that the investigation is directed\n\nto the information provided by the CRA.                     A CRA's notice informs a\n\nfurnisher      of   \"the    nature    of       the   consumer's     challenge    to    the\n\nreported debt, and it is the receipt of this notice that gives rise\n\nto     the     furnisher's         obligation        to     conduct     a     reasonable\n\ninvestigation.\"        Gorman, 584 F.3d at 1157; see also 15 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1681s-2(b)(1)(B) (requiring a furnisher to review \"all relevant\n\ninformation\" provided to it by a CRA).                      Accordingly, the central\n\ninquiry when assessing a consumer's claim under § 1681s-2(b) is\n\n\"whether the furnisher's procedures were reasonable in light of\n\nwhat    it   learned       about    the    nature      of    the    dispute    from    the\n\ndescription in the CRA's notice of dispute.\"                       Gorman, 584 F.3d at\n\n1157; see also Westra, 409 F.3d at 827.\n\n             If a CRA fails to provide \"all relevant information\" to\n\na furnisher, then the consumer has a private cause of action\n\nagainst the CRA, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1681i(a)(2)(A), 1681n-o, but not\n\nagainst the furnisher.\n\n             We measure this case against these standards.\n\n\n                                           -23-\n\f            2.        Summary Judgment Was Appropriate on Chiang's FCRA\n                      Claim for Two Independently Sufficient Reasons\n\n            Against this backdrop, we hold that summary judgment was\n\nappropriate on Chiang's FCRA claim, since Chiang failed to raise a\n\ngenuine    issue    of    material    fact    that    the   investigation     was\n\nunreasonable and also, independently, because he failed to show any\n\nactual inaccuracies that Verizon NE could have found through a\n\nreasonable investigation.           Chiang has presented no evidence that\n\nthe procedures employed by Verizon NE to investigate the reported\n\ndisputes    were    unreasonable.          Indeed,    Chiang   neither   sought\n\ndiscovery   on     nor   produced    any   evidence    whatsoever     about   the\n\nprocedures Verizon NE, through its agent CBCS, used.                   The only\n\nevidence on this point consists of a Verizon employee's uncontested\n\naffidavit detailing the procedures followed by Verizon NE's agent,\n\nCBCS, procedures which are, on their face, not unreasonable.10\n\nChiang's    failure      to   demonstrate     actual    inaccuracies     in   the\n\nfurnished information that a reasonable investigation could have\n\ndiscovered is a separate, sufficient basis for summary judgment.\n\n            As an initial matter, we reject Verizon NE's argument\n\nthat we should categorically exclude Chiang's affidavit, testimony,\n\nand letters from consideration when deciding whether his claim\n\nshould survive summary judgment.           Verizon NE relies on language in\n\n§   1681s-2(a)(1),       which   prohibits     furnishers      from    knowingly\n\n\n     10\n          The parties do not dispute that CBCS followed                       its\nstandard procedures when investigating Chiang's claims.\n\n                                       -24-\n\freporting inaccurate information to CRAs in the first instance.\n\nThat language, \"[f]or purposes of subparagraph (A) [of § 1681s-\n\n2(a)(1)],\" defined a furnisher's \"reasonable cause to believe that\n\n[furnished]    information     is    inaccurate\"       as    \"having   specific\n\nknowledge, other than solely allegations by the consumer.\"                    15\n\nU.S.C. § 1681s-2(a)(1)(D) (emphasis added).\n\n           To start, the statute's plain language restricts this\n\nprovision to subparagraph (A) of § 1681s-2(a)(1), which reads in\n\npart: \"A person shall not furnish any information relating to a\n\nconsumer to any consumer reporting agency if the person knows or\n\nhas   reasonable     cause    to    believe    that    the      information   is\n\ninaccurate.\"     Id. § 1681s-2(a)(1)(A).        It does not refer to the\n\nsection of the FCRA of concern to us.           Even more, the section of\n\nconcern   to   us,   §   1681s-2(b),   does   not     mention    a   furnisher's\n\n\"reasonable cause to believe,\" nor did Congress otherwise add\n\nlanguage about a special evidentiary rule to subsection (b).\n\n           Absent such clear direction from the statutory text, we\n\nsee no reason to adopt a per se rule excluding a plaintiff's\n\naffidavits, testimony, or letters when considering summary judgment\n\non a claim under § 1681s-2(b).              See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2)\n\n(specifying that summary judgment is appropriate only when \"the\n\npleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any\n\naffidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material\n\n\n\n\n                                     -25-\n\ffact\") (emphasis added).11        As the Supreme Court recently noted in\n\na different context, it is not \"necessary or desirable for courts\n\nto    create   special       burden-of-proof     rules,    or     other   special\n\nprocedural or evidentiary rules.\"             Metro.

And even accepting these\n\nmaterials at face value, Chiang's unsupported allegations and\n\nunlikely inference raise no genuine issues of material fact.                 See,\n\ne.g., Hoyos v. Telecorp Commc'n, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 9 (1st Cir.\n\n2007).\n\n            We go back to the relevant evidence.                  Chiang relies\n\nsolely on his own statements that Verizon NE was inaccurate in\n\nreporting he had not paid bills due and owing and his assertions\n\nthat he had discussed his disputes with Verizon NE representatives,\n\nand   he   urges   us   to    infer   that,    as   a   result,    a   reasonable\n\ninvestigation would have revealed Verizon NE's purported awareness\n\n\n\n      11\n          There are, of course, limits on what may be asserted in\nan affidavit at the summary judgment stage. See, e.g., Nieves-\nLuciano v. Hernández-Torres, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789135\"><a href=\"/opinion/789135/milton-nieves-luciano-gerardina-rivera-galvan-shawn-nieves-rivera-richard/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 5 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"For\npurposes of summary judgment, an allegation in an affidavit must be\nbased on personal knowledge and show affirmatively that the affiant\nis competent to testify to the matters stated therein.\").\n\n                                      -26-\n\fof inaccuracies in his account.         In particular, Chiang cites his\n\naffidavit, in which he details alleged overcharges to his account\n\nand conversations with Verizon NE representatives regarding these\n\ncharges that he says took place in November 2005 and August 2006.\n\nChiang also relies on several letters he sent to Verizon NE.              Two\n\nof these letters are chapter 93A demand letters, dated May 16,\n\n2006–-before    Chiang's    first    state    court   lawsuit–-threatening\n\nlitigation if alleged errors in billing on his two accounts were\n\nnot corrected.    The third, dated September 15, 2006, was sent to\n\nVerizon NE's attorney in the midst of Chiang's first state court\n\nsuit and also threatened legal action if Verizon NE did not correct\n\nalleged overcharges.\n\n           At most, Chiang's proffered evidence would have shown\n\nthat Verizon NE was aware he disputed the claimed amount and that,\n\nas of July 2006, the dispute was in state court.                      Chiang's\n\nallegations are consistent with Verizon NE having reviewed his\n\naccount   and   billing    history    and    confirmed   that   the   factual\n\ninformation, while disputed, was nonetheless accurate. Cf. Gorman,\n\n584 F.3d at 1159-60.      Despite ample opportunity over two years of\n\npretrial proceedings, Chiang neither requested nor produced any\n\nevidence inconsistent with this information being accurate.\n\n           Also significant is that CBCS received only cursory\n\nnotices from the CRAs, which were generalized and vague about the\n\nnature of Chiang's disputes.        The summary reports in CBCS's online\n\n\n                                     -27-\n\ffiling   system    indicate   that   the    information     reported    largely\n\nconsisted of broad, non-specific statements. We take them in turn.\n\n            Two reports said that Chiang \"claims that this account\n\nwas never paid late.\" However, Chiang has conceded that, beginning\n\nin August 2006, he did not pay any part of at least some of his\n\ndisputed bills–-so that cannot be the basis for an inaccuracy.\n\nNor, for the same reason, can two other reports, which indicated\n\nthat Chiang claimed to have \"paid the original creditor before\n\ncollection status or paid before charge-off.\"\n\n            Five   reports    said   that   Chiang    \"[c]laims     inaccurate\n\ninformation,\" which was not in the least bit specific as to what\n\ninformation was disputed.        Finally, several reports essentially\n\nsaid that the consumer disputed the account and the account was\n\ninvolved in litigation, which was true, was not challenged by\n\nVerizon NE, and again, provided no guidance as to either the\n\nspecific    information   that   was   disputed      or   the   basis   for   the\n\ndispute.\n\n            None of these reports alerted CBCS to which of the\n\nallegedly     erroneous   charges    underlying      Chiang's     dispute     was\n\ninaccurate.     Nor did they evidence that a more searching inquiry\n\nmay have been necessary.      See Westra, 409 F.3d at 827 (holding that\n\na furnisher was entitled to summary judgment on § 1681s-2(b) claim\n\nbecause merely verifying that account information was accurate as\n\nreported was reasonable, given \"scant information\" received from\n\n\n                                     -28-\n\fthe CRA); see also Gorman, 584 F.3d at 1157-58.   We repeat that an\n\ninvestigation under § 1681s-2(b) is geared to the information\n\nprovided by the CRA to the furnisher; if the CRA fails in its\n\nobligation to provide \"all relevant information regarding the\n\ndispute,\" 15 U.S.C. § 1681i(a)(2)(A), then there is a claim against\n\nthe CRA but not the furnisher.\n\n           Plaintiff's behavior in refusing to engage in discovery\n\nor provide any information about the reasonableness of Verizon NE's\n\ninvestigation procedures cannot be a shortcut to trial on the\n\nmerits.   The fact that Chiang put on evidence that he told Verizon\n\nNE he disputed various bills does not itself raise a reasonable\n\ninference that Verizon NE, through CBCS, conducted an unreasonable\n\ninvestigation or that the furnished information was not accurate.\n\nThat evidence is not enough. See, e.g., Nat'l Amusements, Inc., 43\n\nF.3d at 735.12\n\n\n     12\n           The district court cited the Fourth Circuit's decision in\nJohnson in support of its determination that a reasonable jury\nmight conclude that Verizon's procedures were unreasonable.\nChiang, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">102707</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *9. But several distinguishing factors\nsuggest that Johnson cannot support the weight the district court\nplaced upon it.     First, in Johnson, the court noted that the\nfurnisher's limited investigation could be deemed unreasonable in\npart because the furnisher's inquiry occurred after it had been\nnotified by the CRA \"of the specific nature of Johnson's dispute.\"\nJohnson, 357 F.3d at 431. Verizon NE had no such notice.\n     It is true the court emphasized that the defendant furnisher's\ninvestigation generally extended no further than its own\ncomputerized Customer Information System (CIS), but unlike CBCS's\nprocedures, it apparently never provided for more searching review.\nId.    That was pertinent because the furnisher artificially\nrestricted    the  review   of   its   own   computerized   records.\nInvestigators needed only to confirm \"two out of four pieces of\n\n                                 -29-\n\f            Independently,     we   agree   with    the       district    court's\n\napplication of our holding in DeAndrade to conclude that Chiang was\n\nrequired to present evidence of actual inaccuracies in his account\n\nthat an alternative investigation might have uncovered. He has not\n\ndone so.\n\n            Chiang's affidavit and letters show that he had several\n\ndisagreements with Verizon NE over his billing, which extended into\n\nstate court litigation; Verizon NE does not dispute this.                  Chiang\n\nhas not, however, demonstrated that any of his substantive disputes\n\nwith Verizon NE involved actual, factual inaccuracies in his\n\nbilling that a reasonable investigation could have detected.                     To\n\nthe   extent   that   his   argument   reduces     to   the    claim     that   any\n\ninvestigation that did not accept his allegations as accurate was\n\nby definition unreasonable, it fails.               For this reason, too,\n\nsummary judgment was appropriate on Chiang's FCRA claim.\n\nB.          Summary Judgment Was Appropriate on Chiang's FDCPA Claim\n\n            Summary judgment was also appropriate on Chiang's FDCPA\n\nclaim.     We agree with the district court's determination that\n\nVerizon NE does not qualify as a \"debt collector\" under the\n\n\n\ninformation contained in the CIS--name, address, social security\nnumber, and date of birth--in order to verify [a consumer's]\nidentity.\" Id. at 431 n.3. This truncated inquiry was how the\nfurnisher confirmed to CRAs that their information was accurate.\nId. at 431.    As there is no evidence of similarly restricted\ninvestigation here, or anything else that might raise a genuine\nissue of material fact as to the reasonableness of Verizon NE's\ninvestigation, summary judgment was appropriate.\n\n                                    -30-\n\fstatute.     Chiang's assertions to the contrary are either wholly\n\nunsupported by the record or waived.\n\n            The FDCPA was enacted to protect debtors from abusive\n\ndebt collection practices. 15 U.S.C. § 1692(e); see also Lapine et\n\nal., supra § 155.02, at 155-6.           To that end, it regulates debt\n\ncollectors' tactics and, inter alia, creates a private cause of\n\naction for victims of \"oppressive or offensive collection agency\n\nbehavior.\"    Lapine et al., supra § 155.02, at 155-6.         The statute\n\ndefines \"debt collector\" as any individual in a business whose\n\n\"principal purpose . . . is the collection of any debts, or who\n\nregularly collects or attempts to collect . . . debts owed or due\n\nor asserted to be owed or due to another.\"          15 U.S.C. § 1692a(6).\n\n            Creditors collecting on their own accounts are generally\n\nexcluded from the statute's reach.            Id. § 1692a(6)(F)(ii); cf.\n\nArruda v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200185\"><a href=\"/opinion/200185/arruda-v-degrenier/\"><span class=\"volume\">310</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 22 n.4 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).     There is, however, a limited exception for \"any creditor\n\nwho, in the process of collecting his own debts, uses any name\n\nother than his own which would indicate that a third person is\n\ncollecting or attempting to collect such debts.\"          Id. § 1692a(6).\n\nThe   exception   was    designed   to   combat   \"flat-rating,\"    whereby\n\ncreditors attempt to intimidate debtors by creating the false\n\nimpression    that   a   third   party   is   participating   in   the   debt\n\ncollection process. See White v. Goodman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767287\"><a href=\"/opinion/767287/patricia-white-on-her-behalf-and-on-behalf-of-all-others-similarly/\"><span class=\"volume\">200</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1016</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1017 (7th\n\nCir. 2000).\n\n\n                                    -31-\n\f              Chiang claims that Verizon NE violated several provisions\n\nof the FDCPA, including its proscription of \"conduct the natural\n\nconsequence of which is to harass, oppress, or abuse any person in\n\nconnection with the collection of a debt.\"                15 U.S.C. § 1692d.\n\nAlthough Verizon NE is not a debt collector, Chiang urges that it\n\nfalls within the exception for creditors because the company\n\nattempted to collect its own debt from him under the allegedly\n\ndeceptive name \"Verizon Massachusetts.\" Chiang does not claim that\n\nVerizon NE was directly collecting its own debts, but instead\n\nasserts that debt collectors were instructed by Verizon NE to use\n\nthe name \"Verizon Massachusetts.\"             Chiang's argument fails.\n\n              Assuming, dubitante, that the alleged practice would\n\nrender   Verizon     NE   a    \"debt   collector\"      under   the   FDCPA,   we\n\nnonetheless agree with the district court that Chiang's argument\n\nshould   be    rejected   as   a   mere   conclusory     allegation,    utterly\n\nunsupported by the record.         E.g., Estate of Bennett v. Wainwright,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203594\"><a href=\"/opinion/203594/estate-of-bennett-v-wainwright/\"><span class=\"volume\">548</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">155</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 177-78 (1st Cir. 2008).             On appeal, Chiang insists,\n\nwithout further explanation or citation to caselaw, that the\n\ndistrict court's failure to draw the inference that debt collectors\n\nreceived the name \"Verizon Massachusetts\" from Verizon NE was\n\nerroneous.      His declaration does not make it so.\n\n              Absent any evidence that Verizon NE was collecting its\n\nown debts we need not reach Chiang's argument that the use of the\n\nname     \"Verizon      Massachusetts\"          would    deceive      consumers,\n\n\n                                       -32-\n\funsophisticated or otherwise.          Cf. Maguire v.
