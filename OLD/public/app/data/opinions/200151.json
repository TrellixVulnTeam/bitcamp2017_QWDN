Juan M. Pérez-Giménez, [U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                      Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n              Torruella and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n    Joseph C. Laws, Jr., Federal Public Defender, for petitioner.\n\n\n\n                         March 4, 2003\n\f            BOUDIN, Chief Judge.        In April 2002, Quester Sterling-\n\nSuarez was indicted for federal crimes stemming from his alleged\n\ninvolvement in an armed car robbery in which one of the guards was\n\nkilled.     One of the charges permits the death penalty.                See 18\n\nU.S.C. § 924(j) (2000).           He asked that \"learned counsel\" be\n\nappointed    pursuant   to   18    U.S.C.    §   3005   (2000);   the   statute\n\nspecifies that two counsel, one of whom \"shall be learned in the\n\nlaw applicable to capital cases,\" must at the defendant's request\n\nbe appointed \"promptly.\"       The district court declined the request,\n\nruling    that   appointment      of   learned    counsel   should      await   a\n\ndetermination by the Attorney General as to whether to seek the\n\ndeath penalty.\n\n            Sterling-Suarez sought mandamus from this court to compel\n\nan immediate appointment of learned counsel. This panel determined\n\nthat the question of whether such appointments may be deferred\n\npresented an issue of continuing importance justifying advisory\n\nmandamus.     On the merits, we concluded that statutory language\n\nsupported petitioner's reading, noting that learned counsel could\n\nbe useful in seeking to dissuade the Attorney General from seeking\n\nthe death penalty. Accordingly, we granted the writ, ordering that\n\n\"[l]earned counsel shall be appointed forthwith.\" In re Sterling-\n\nSuarez, 306 F.3d 1170, 1175 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n            Following the grant of the writ, the district court\n\nappointed \"as learned counsel\" Joseph Laws, the Federal Public\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fDefender for the District of Puerto Rico, as well as a second\n\nlawyer as          co-counsel.        This   followed   a     determination      by   the\n\ndistrict judge that Laws personally would qualify as learned\n\ncounsel because, other qualifications aside, he had recently served\n\nas co-counsel in a death penalty case, albeit one that ended\n\nwithout a trial.              Throughout, Laws has maintained that no one in\n\nhis office had the necessary qualifications and, in addition, that\n\nthis appointment would unduly strain the limited resources of his\n\nheavily-burdened office.1\n\n               Following        his   appointment,     Laws    filed   a   \"motion     to\n\nenforce mandamus\" which is now before us.                   In this document, Laws\n\nargues that he does not qualify as \"learned in the law applicable\n\nto capital cases\" under the statute and that his prior experience\n\nas   co-counsel          in   an   untried   capital    case    does   not     meet   the\n\nrequirement of the \"prior experience . . . as defense counsel in a\n\ncapital case\" prescribed by a local rule of the district court.\n\nP.R.       Local    R.    482(4).     Laws   urges   that     the   district    court's\n\ndesignation of Laws as learned counsel is merely \"ostensibl[e],\"\n\nand that a further order should be issued \"to enforce\" the earlier\n\nwrit.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      Prior to the writ, Laws' office had been appointed as counsel\nfor petitioner without a judicial determination that anyone in the\noffice qualified as learned counsel; as the district court then\nread the statute no such determination was required.\n\n                                             -3-\n\f                What is perfectly clear is that the writ of mandamus\n\npreviously issued by this court was concerned, simply and solely,\n\nwith when learned counsel had to be appointed under the \"promptly\"\n\nlanguage of the statute. True, our order said that learned counsel\n\nshould be appointed forthwith, but an order is properly read in\n\nrelation to the decision that supports it; and \"[t]he reach of the\n\nmandate is generally limited to matters actually decided.\"                  18B\n\nWright, Miller & Cooper, Federal Courts § 4478.3 (2002). Questions\n\nas to who qualifies as learned counsel were not resolved in the\n\nproceeding leading up to the writ, and their resolution by the\n\ndistrict court cannot violate our prior order.2\n\n                Whether Laws does qualify as learned counsel may well be\n\nopen       to   debate.   But   unlike   the   meaning   of   the   \"promptly\"\n\nrequirement, the question as to the qualifications required of\n\nlearned counsel is less than clear-cut and the question whether an\n\nindividual lawyer qualifies as learned counsel may depend on\n\ncircumstances that vary markedly from case to case.                 The lack of\n\na clear answer, and the likelihood that no simple rule will dictate\n\nanswers in other cases, make this a less obvious case for mandamus.\n\nIn re Cargill, 66 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (1st Cir. 1995); United States\n\nv. Horn, 29 F.3d 754, 769-770 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n\n\n       2\n      See, e.g., Biggins v. Hazen Paper Co., 111 F.3d 205, 209 (1st\nCir.), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 952 (1997); Jones v. Lewis, 957 F.2d\n260, 262-63 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 841 (1992); United\nStates v. Tenzer, 213 F.3d 34, 41-44 (2d Cir. 2000).\n\n                                     -4-\n\f            Nothing in this decision prevents the filing of a new\n\nmandamus    petition   to   challenge      Laws'   designation   as   learned\n\ncounsel.    But such a petition would have to begin with a showing\n\nthat this issue meets the ordinary qualifications for resolution by\n\nmandamus.     Certainly     death   penalty    cases   are   different,   but\n\nCongress has not provided for automatic interlocutory appeals in\n\ndisputes as to the appointment of counsel.\n\n            Accordingly, the motion to enforce mandamus is dismissed\n\nwithout prejudice to the filing, if petitioner is so inclined, of\n\na mandamus petition seeking to present the question of whether Laws\n\nis qualified as learned counsel.\n\n            It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                            (Dissent follows.)\n\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f            TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge, dissenting.       Today the panel\n\ndeclines to enforce its mandamus ordering district court Judge\n\nPérez-Giménez to appoint \"learned counsel\" pursuant to 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3005 in the capital case of Quester Sterling-Suárez.                The\n\nmajority concludes that the district court did not violate our\n\nmandate, and, that even if the court's appointment of Joseph Laws\n\nwas   erroneous,   this   case   is    nevertheless   inappropriate   for\n\nmandamus.    I respectfully disagree. The district court is simply\n\nnot in compliance with our mandate of October 22, 2002. Therefore,\n\nmandamus is the proper tool to ensure compliance with our mandate.\n\n            The majority explains its hesitation to enforce its\n\norder in part by stating that the issue raised by the petition,\n\nnamely, whether Joseph Laws can qualify as \"learned counsel,\" is\n\n\"less than clear-cut,\" and concludes that because the instant\n\npetition (unlike our original mandamus) affords no obvious answer,\n\n\"this is a less obvious case for mandamus.\" Maj. Op. at 4.            The\n\nmajority then cites two cases, In re Cargill, 66 F.3d 1256, 1259-60\n\n(1st Cir. 1995), and United States v. Horn, 29 F.3d 754, 769-70\n\n(1st Cir. 1994), which set a very high bar for issuance of the\n\nwrit. Id.\n\n            It is axiomatic that the remedy of mandamus is a drastic\n\none and should be invoked only under extraordinary circumstances.\n\nKerr v. United States District Court, 426 U.S. 394, 402 (1976).\n\nThat said, we issued our original mandate due the extraordinary\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fcircumstances of a district court's refusal to give timely effect\n\nto a capital defendant's unambiguous statutory right to \"learned\n\ncounsel.\"     Although I respect the majority's desire to avoid\n\nissuing the writ lightly, I disagree with the burden the majority\n\nplaces on the instant petition.\n\n            The   relevant   question    is   not   whether   the   petition\n\npresents \"a clear answer,\" or whether the issue raised in the\n\ninstant petition would be better raised in a new mandamus petition;\n\nrather the sole question is whether the district court is in\n\ncompliance with our original mandate.\n\n            \"One of the less controversial functions of mandamus is\n\nto assure that a lower court complies with the spirit, as well as\n\nthe letter of the mandate issued to that court by a higher court.\"\n\nIn re Continental Securities Litigation, 985 F.2d 867, 869 (7th\n\nCir. 1992); see also 18B Wright, Miller & Cooper, Federal Practice\n\nand Procedure § 4478.3 (2d ed. 2002) (\"Enforcement [of a mandate]\n\nalso may be accomplished by mandamus, and indeed this is one of the\n\nmost nearly routine uses of this 'extraordinary writ.'\").            Indeed,\n\nwhere a district court fails to comply with an order of a federal\n\nappellate court, the need for mandamus becomes more urgent and a\n\ncourt's reluctance to issue the writ is proportionally diminished.\n\nSee Citibank, N.A. v. Fullam, 580 F.2d 82, 86-87 (1978) (\"[Courts]\n\nhave uniformly granted such writs in one situation where the\n\ndistrict court has failed to adhere to an order of the court of\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fappeals.\"). With respect, we need not consider whether the instant\n\npetition satisfies the requirements for mandamus articulated in\n\ncases such as Cargill and Horn, because those cases do not address\n\nthe issue of mandamus in the context of compelling a lower court to\n\ncomply with an appellate court's mandate.   Because of the district\n\ncourt's failure to adhere to our mandate, the standard for mandamus\n\nhere is far less onerous: if the district court has not heeded our\n\nmandate, the writ should issue.\n\n             The question then is whether the appointment of Joseph\n\nLaws -- an attorney who has never actually tried a capital case --\n\ncomplies with our mandate that \"learned counsel\" be appointed\n\nforthwith.\n\n          The first time this case came before us, we issued a writ\n\nordering Judge Pérez-Giménez to comply with the terms of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3005 because of a concern that the judge had adopted a policy of\n\ndelaying the appointment of \"learned counsel\" until the Department\n\nof Justice notifies the court of its intent to seek the death\n\npenalty. In re Sterling-Suárez, 306 F.3d 1170 (1st Cir. 2002); see\n\nalso United States v. Torres Gómez, 62 F.Supp.2d 402 (D.P.R. 1999)\n\n(Pérez-Giménez, J.)(delaying appointment of \"learned counsel\" and\n\nexpressing frustration with expenses related to the appointment of\n\n\"learned counsel\"). Our mandate was simple: \"Learned counsel shall\n\nbe appointed forthwith.\"    In re Sterling-Suárez, 306 F.3d at 1175.\n\nAlthough the district court's actions compelled us to explicitly\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fconstrue the term \"promptly,\" our failure to precisely spell out\n\nthe meaning of each word of our six-word mandate does not mean that\n\nthose words did not constitute \"matters actually decided.\" Maj. Op.\n\nat 4.       The term \"learned\" was not inserted idly, or for rhetorical\n\neffect.        When this court ordered the appointment of \"learned\"\n\ncounsel, I thought it meant what it said; that is, our mandate\n\nmeant that the defendant had an immediate right of access to second\n\ncounsel, and that at least one of his two attorneys should be\n\nskilled in the law applicable to death penalty cases.\n\n               Even    if     our   mandate   simply    ordered   the     immediate\n\nappointment of \"learned counsel\" without pausing to define the term\n\n\"learned,\" by consulting our opinion it should have been evident to\n\nthe district court that we understood the term \"learned\" to mean\n\n\"skilled or practiced in the law applicable to capital cases.\" The\n\nissue was undoubtedly before the Court: briefs by the petitioner\n\nand amicus curiae stressed the level of expertise that \"learned\n\ncounsel\" could be expected to bring to Sterling-Suárez's defense,\n\nand repeatedly emphasized that because there has never been a\n\ncapital       case    tried    to   completion   in    this   district,    \"learned\n\ncounsel\" with actual death penalty experience would need to be\n\nimported.3       Far more important is the fact that the text of our\n\n\n        3\n      Moreover, this Court was aware that the District of Puerto\nRico has generated more than its fair share of 18 U.S.C. § 3005\nlitigation, see In re Sterling-Suárez 306 F.3d at 1172-73, and that\nbecause of the district's inexperience trying capital cases,\nappointing \"learned counsel\" can be a difficult and lengthy\n\n                                          -9-\n\fopinion clearly indicates that we considered the issue of what\n\nqualifies as \"learnedness\" under section 3005.              See United States\n\nv. Cote, 51 F.3d 178, 182 (9th Cir. 1995) (\"[T]he opinion delivered\n\nby [the] court at the time of rendering its decree may be consulted\n\nto ascertain what was intended by its mandate.\" (quoting In re\n\nSalford Fork & Tool Co., 160 U.S. 247, 256 (1895)).\n\n              First, our opinion made several references to our high\n\nexpectations of \"learned counsel.\"             We noted that the purpose of\n\n§ 3005 was that \"learned counsel's\" \"special learning in the law\n\n'applicable to capital cases' is likely to be especially useful in\n\nmaking and supporting arguments about mitigating and aggravating\n\nfactors. . . made . . . when the jury is determining the sentence.\"\n\nIn re Sterling-Suárez, 306 F.3d at 1173 (emphasis added). We noted\n\nthat capital litigation was in many ways sui generis and listed by\n\nname several federal death penalty statutes about which counsel\n\nshould   be    \"learned.\"      Specifically,      we    stated   that    \"learned\n\ncounsel\"      should   be   familiar    with   the     complex   death    penalty\n\nprocedure required by 18 U.S.C. § 3591 (2000).               Additionally, we\n\ntwice noted that learned counsel would provide expertise regarding\n\nissues involving mitigating and aggravating factors under 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3592 (2000), issues which would likely be missed by otherwise\n\n\n\nprocess. \"Federal defendants in Puerto Rico facing a possible death\nsentence must always look to the mainland for qualified legal\nassistance.\" United States v. Colón-Miranda, 985 F.Supp. 36 (D.P.R.\n1997) (Fusté, J.).\n\n                                       -10-\n\fcompetent attorneys who lacked experience in death penalty cases.\n\nId.\n\n            Second, a necessary implication of our opinion is that\n\n\"learned\" signifies a substantial amount of experience in capital\n\nlitigation.     We stated that the term \"promptly\" could not be\n\ndefined except as it refers to the event which was to promptly\n\noccur, namely, appointment of an attorney with experience in\n\ncapital cases.      As we stated: \"the term 'promptly' is not self-\n\ndefining; if there were no purpose served by appointing learned\n\ncounsel . . . one could argue that the appointment should be made\n\npromptly when it mattered and not before.\"             Id. at 1173 (emphasis\n\nadded).     That statement is an explicit finding that in order to\n\ndefine the term \"promptly\" it was necessary to recognize the\n\nstatutory    purpose   for    requiring       the   appointment   of   \"learned\n\ncounsel.\" Since the purpose served by appointing \"learned counsel\"\n\nis to provide capital defendants in federal court with an attorney\n\nexperienced    in   death    penalty    law,    the   statute's    purpose   was\n\nundeniably a matter \"actually decided\" by this court. See Eichmann\n\nv. Fotomat Corp., 880 F.2d 149, 157 (9th Cir. 1989) (noting that\n\nthe mandate doctrine \"encompasses a court's explicit decisions as\n\nwell as those issues decided by necessary implication\").\n\n            Now, the petitioner challenges that the district court's\n\nactions contradict the purpose of 18 U.S.C. § 3005.               If the issues\n\nof timing and purpose were so intertwined at the time of our\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fopinion that neither in its own right was \"self defining,\" I fail\n\nto understand the majority's present contention that we never\n\nconsidered this issue.        In addition to our express acknowledgment\n\nthat the timing question in § 3005 was inseparably linked to the\n\nstatute's    purpose,   the    quotations   cited   above   provide   ample\n\nevidence that the purpose of appointing \"learned counsel\" was an\n\nissue we \"actually decided.\" Id.\n\n            Finally, to construe \"learned in the law applicable to\n\ncapital cases\" in a manner that does not entail actual experience\n\nin a capital trial or appeal divests the terms \"learned\" and\n\n\"applicable to capital cases\" of any tangible meaning.            Such an\n\ninterpretation could not possibly have been our intent.          Congress\n\nplainly had more than this in mind when it amended § 3005 to\n\nrequire counsel to be learned in the law \"applicable to capital\n\ncases.\"4    Its insertion of the phrase \"applicable to capital cases\"\n\n(referenced in our opinion) was manifestly intended to require that\n\n\"learned counsel\" have expertise relevant to capital litigation,\n\nand not merely to the practice of criminal law generally.               See\n\nUnited States v. McCulluah, 76 F.3d 1087, 1098 (10th Cir. 1996)\n\n(finding that the amendment to § 3005 \"did not merely 'clarify' the\n\nlaw but rather substantively changed it, creating a new requirement\n\n\n\n     4\n      In 1994, Congress amended 18 U.S.C. § 3005 by, inter alia,\nsubstituting the phrase \"learned in the law applicable to capital\ncases,\" for the less stringent \"learned in the law.\" 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3005, amended by Pub. L. No. 103-322 § 60026 (1994).\n\n                                    -12-\n\fwhich previously   had   not   existed\").   At   a   minimum,   \"learned\n\ncounsel\" should possess \"distinguished prior experience in the\n\ntrial, appeal, or post-conviction review of federal death penalty\n\ncases.\" United States v. Miranda, 148 F.Supp.2d 292, 294 (S.D.N.Y.\n\n2001) (quotation omitted).5\n\n          In the instant petition, the appointed \"learned counsel,\"\n\nJoseph Laws, argues that because he has no experience trying\n\ncapital cases, he cannot qualify as \"learned counsel\" under the\n\n\n     5\n      If, despite these passages from our opinion, I am wrong and\nthe issue of \"learned counsel's\" qualifications \"was not resolved\nin the proceeding leading up to the writ,\" Maj. Op. at 4, it does\nnot necessarily follow that this Court is powerless to address the\ndistrict court's failure to adhere to our mandate at this stage.\nAs several Circuits have found, courts of appeals have \"the power\nto issue a writ of mandamus that would resolve [controversy in the\nlower court] by clarifying its previous mandate.\" American Trucking\nAss'ns v. ICC, 669 F.2d 957, 960 (5th Cir. 1982) (quoting City of\nCleveland v. FPC, 561 F.2d 344, 346-47 (D.C. Cir. 1977)). Such a\nclarifying approach \"may appropriately be utilized to correct a\nmisconception of the scope and effect of the appellate decision.\"\nId.\n\n     Indeed, clarifying our mandate so as to determine that Joseph\nLaws does not qualify as \"learned counsel\" at this stage is\npreferable to the possibility of reviewing this case on appeal\nafter a final decision has been rendered. The burden placed on the\ndefendant of showing post hoc that he was prejudiced by the\nappointment of one attorney over another will, I fear, create\nextraordinarily complicated legal problems for a reviewing court.\nSuch concerns have led the Fourth Circuit to adopt a rule that\nfailure to comply with § 3005 violation \"gives rise to an\nirrebutable presumption of prejudice.\" United States v. Williams,\n544 F.2d 1215, 1218 (4th Cir. 1976) (quoting United States v.\nWatson, 496 F.2d 1125, 1129-30 (4th Cir. 1973)); see also, United\nStates v. Boone, 245 F.3d 352, 360-61 n.8, 364 (4th Cir. 2001)\n(vacating defendant's conviction despite potential harmlessness of\nthe § 3005 violation because, in the court's view, 18 U.S.C. § 3005\n\"would be eviscerated by application of the harmless error doctrine\n[and the court] perceive[d] no alternative but to enforce it\").\n\n                                 -13-\n\fstatute.    Further, Laws avers that by circumventing the purpose of\n\nour mandamus, namely, the timely appointment of counsel with death\n\npenalty experience, the district judge has not complied with our\n\norder that \"learned counsel shall be appointed forthwith.\" In re\n\nQuester Sterling-Suárez, 306 F.3d at 1175.\n\n            I agree. Although the district court has purported to\n\ncomply with our order by indeed appointing counsel \"forthwith,\"\n\nJoseph Laws is not \"learned\" under any sound interpretation of our\n\norder, of section 3005, or of any other relevant \"learned counsel\"\n\nprovision. The unique skills identified in our opinion are not the\n\nkind one might gain in the ordinary practice of federal criminal\n\ndefense.     As an American Bar Association study explained, the\n\ncomplex death penalty procedures articulated by § 3591, et seq.,\n\nrequire that counsel \"be knowledgeable about a complex body of\n\nconstitutional law and unusual procedures that do not apply in\n\nother criminal cases.\" American Bar Association, Toward a More Just\n\nand Effective System of Review in State Death Penalty Cases, 40 Am.\n\nU. L. Rev. 1, 63 (1990).        Such complexities are often missed by\n\nlawyers lacking considerable experience litigating capital cases.\n\nAs a report from the Judicial Conference of the United States\n\nnoted, even \"seasoned federal criminal lawyers who lacked death\n\npenalty experience miss[] important issues.\"               Subcommittee on\n\nFederal    Death   Penalty   Cases,    Committee   on   Defender   Services,\n\nJudicial Conference of the United States, Federal Death Penalty\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fCases: Recommendations Concerning the Cost and Quality of Defense\n\nRepresentation, at I.C.1.(May 1998) [hereinafter \"Spencer Report\"].\n\n           In sum, the multiple committees which have looked at this\n\nissue   have    concluded      that     \"learned     counsel\"    \"should   have\n\ndistinguished prior experience in the trial, appeal, or post\n\nconviction     review   of    federal    death   penalty   cases.\"   Guide    to\n\nJudiciary Policies and Procedures, Vol. VII Ch. VI, § 6.01 B\n\n(emphasis added); Spencer Report at II.1. Because neither Laws nor\n\nanyone in his office has ever tried a death penalty case to\n\ncompletion,     there    is    no     basis    for   deviating    from     these\n\nrecommendations in this case.\n\n           Laws' motion is not a new petition, and it does not raise\n\na new issue; we are asked only to enforce our own order regarding\n\nactions by the judge to whom the order was directed.               We are in a\n\nposition to decide this matter because we can accept the facts\n\nstated in the district court's opinion as true, and all that\n\nremains is an issue of law, namely, whether Joseph Laws can\n\nqualify as \"learned counsel.\"           Although I believe that Laws is a\n\nskilled and accomplished Federal Public Defender, his current\n\nexperience does not permit him to qualify as \"learned counsel\" in\n\nthis or any other capital case. Therefore, I conclude that despite\n\nhis appointment, the district court is not in compliance with our\n\nmandate.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\f            It is both appropriate and routine for a court of appeals\n\nto issue mandamus where a district court \"fails to comply with the\n\nspirit as well as the letter of the mandate issued . . . by a\n\nhigher court.\"    Continental Illinois, 985 F.2 at 869.    Where our\n\norders are issued to protect the rights of a defendant in a capital\n\ntrial, we should be especially vigilant in seeing that they are\n\nfollowed.    I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\f",

A federal public defender in Puerto Rico was appointed as counsel. On April 3, 2002, a grand jury indicted petitioner on several counts for his alleged involvement in an armored car robbery in which one of the guards was killed. 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 924(c)(1)(A)(iii), 924(j), 1951(a) (2000). The charges included a count for which the death penalty is a permissible penalty.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 4, 2002, the day following the indictment, petitioner asked that he be appointed \"learned counsel\" in accordance with 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3005. As amended in 1994, \"learned counsel\" under section 3005 has to have expertise in the law \"applicable to capital cases.\" <i>See also United States v. McCullah,</i> 76 F.3d 1087, 1098 (10th Cir. 1996), <i>cert. denied,</i> 520 U.S. 1213, 117 S.Ct. 1699, 137 L.Ed.2d 825 (1997). Under the District of Puerto Rico's Local Rule 428(4), lead counsel in a capital case must possess a number of specified qualifications which include prior experience, within the last three years, \"as defense counsel in a capital case.\" The rule also provides that its provision should be implemented by the presiding judge \"at the earliest practical opportunity, once a defendant is charged in a capital case.\" <i>Id.</i> 428(1). The Federal Public Defender's office represents that it does not have a person thus qualified in its office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 9, 2002, the government filed a certificate, as required by local rules, identifying the case as one in which the maximum possible penalty is death. D.P.R. R. 428(2)(A). The decision whether to seek the death penalty is made by the Attorney General, but only after considering the recommendations of the local U.S. attorney and an advisory committee within the Department of Justice. United States Attorneys' Manual &#167; 9-10.020 (June 7, 2001). Under Department of Justice procedures, defense counsel is entitled to make submissions to both the U.S. attorney and the Department, arguing that the Attorney General's discretion should be exercised against seeking the death penalty. <i>Id.</i> &#167;&#167; 9-10.030, 9-10.050.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 24, 2002, during a status conference, petitioner's April 4 request for appointment of learned counsel was denied. The court explained: \"Once the Court receives the decision from the Department of Justice, then learned counsel will be appointed.\" Following the superseding indictment, petitioner asked the district court to reconsider its denial of the motion requesting immediate appointment of learned counsel. On July 8, 2002, the district court denied the motion for reconsideration. Petitioner then sought mandamus from this court to compel the appointment of learned counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily, mandamus is treated as an extraordinary remedy granted only where there is a clear entitlement to relief and threat of irreparable harm. <i>In re Cargill, Inc.,</i> 66 F.3d 1256, 1260 (1st Cir. 1995), <i>cert. denied,</i> 517 U.S. 1156, 116 S.Ct. 1545, 134 L.Ed.2d 648 (1996). The government points out that if petitioner were convicted and sentenced to death, he would be able to raise his statutory claim on direct appeal and it argues that the statutory claim made by petitioner is at least debatable. Of course, the reality is that once a determination by the Attorney General is made to seek the death penalty, the incentive for defendant to plead guilty in exchange for a term of imprisonment is obvious.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question whether there is a threat of irreparable injury and clear error need not be decided. This is so because this court has authority to grant \"advisory mandamus\" in situations that involve undecided questions of \"great public importance\" that are likely to recur. <i>See United States v. Horn,</i> 29 F.3d 754, 769-70 (1st Cir.1994). The occasions for employing advisory mandamus are and should remain extremely rare; the procedure should be reserved only to address questions \"likely of significant repetition prior to effective review\" where guidance from the court will assist other judges, parties or lawyers. <i>In re Bushkin Assocs., Inc.,</i> 864 F.2d 241 (1st Cir.1989) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, the question when learned counsel must be appointed in a federal capital case is a recurring question that ought to be settled at the earliest opportunity. Although the question has arisen several times within this circuit, <i>e.g. United States v. Torres G&#243;mez,</i> 62 F.Supp.2d 402, 407-08 (D.P.R.1999), it has not yet been, but clearly ought to be, definitively resolved by this court. In addition to the obvious interest of the defendant, a speedy resolution also serves the public interest in assuring compliance with the special requirements that Congress has imposed, by statute, for capital cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the merits, statutory language and policy alike support the view that &#8212; in general and without ruling out the possibility of unusual circumstances &#8212; learned counsel is to be appointed reasonably soon after the indictment and prior to the time that submissions are to be made to persuade the Attorney General not to seek the death penalty. As the statute is written, the word \"promptly\" is used in relation to a prior event &#8212; namely, the indictment of the defendant upon a capital crime. Nothing suggests that this appointment is to await the Attorney General's determination to seek the death penalty, although Congress could easily have so provided if it had wanted to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admittedly, the term \"promptly\" is not self-defining; if there were no purpose served by appointing learned counsel until the Attorney General had decided to seek the death penalty one could argue that the appointment should be made promptly <i>when</i> it mattered and not before. But surely in death penalty litigation, special learning in the law \"applicable to capital cases,\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3005, is likely to be especially useful in making and supporting arguments about mitigating and aggravating factors, primarily made at the stage when the Attorney General is determining whether or not to seek the death penalty and (still later) when the jury is determining the sentence. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3591 (special conditions), 3592 (mitigating and aggravating factors) (2000). By contrast, whether the defendant committed the crime is a trial phase issue often little different than those presented in non-capital cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Quite possibly, as the government urges, the submissions to the Attorney General are not matters of right and the Departmental procedures that invite such submissions do not create an entitlement. But our concern here is with a <i>statutory</i> right to learned counsel; and the practical opportunity for learned counsel to persuade the Attorney General casts light on what the word \"promptly\" means in the statute. Similarly, we are not concerned with whether, for purposes of \"the right to counsel\" under the Sixth Amendment, the preliminary submissions are or are not a \"critical\" phase of the proceeding. <i>United States v. Gouveia,</i> 467 U.S. 180, 189, 104 S.Ct. 2292, 81 L.Ed.2d 146 (1984); <i>compare United States v. Pe&#241;a-Gonz&#225;lez,</i> 62 F.Supp.2d 358, 361-64 (D.P.R.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's contrary position on the meaning of \"promptly\" rests on three arguments. The first is that in the 1994 amendments to section 3005, Congress imposed the requirement of counsel \"learned in the law applicable to capital cases,\" and, as to the timing of counsel's appointment, changed \"immediately\" to \"promptly.\" <i>See also Torres G&#243;mez,</i> 62 F.Supp.2d at 407. Nothing indicates that the substitution was meant to authorize a delay until after the Attorney General decided to seek the death penalty. It is equally possible that \"promptly\" was chosen in place of \"immediately\" because securing learned counsel &#8212; especially in a jurisdiction like Puerto Rico that does not have capital punishment for local crimes &#8212; may be a process that takes a reasonable amount of time and can hardly be done \"immediately\" after indictment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's next argument is based upon policy rather than the statute. It argues that securing and compensating learned counsel is an expensive process. A considerable number of cases are eligible for capital punishment but in many the Attorney General decides not to seek the death penalty. This, in the government's view, means that in such cases the appointment of learned counsel will be wasted. This might seem an inhumane argument, but &#8212; in a case where the statutory language were less clear &#8212; a vast expenditure to practically no purpose might well count as an argument against petitioner's interpretation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the argument is faulty. In some cases the early appointment of learned counsel will not be wasted at all but may well make the difference as to whether the Attorney General seeks the death penalty (and perhaps as to whether defendant lives or dies). Further, the submission to the Attorney General is a comparatively informal one and in those cases where the opposition succeeds in persuading the Attorney General not to seek the death penalty, a substantial additional expenditure on the trial and sentencing phase of a capital case is likely to be avoided. There is certainly no indication that requiring employment at the earlier stage will necessarily be a waste of money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the government asserts that the case law is favorable to it because at least three circuits held under the pre-1994 version of section 3005 that (we quote from the government's brief) \"the two-attorney provision did not apply when the defendant did not actually face the death penalty.\" The government says that Congress' enactment of the 1994 amendment, done against the background of these prior interpretations, should be taken to embody the then-existing view of the courts. Yet all three of the cases cited by the government were ones in which the death penalty was no longer available for the defendant because of <i>Furman v. Georgia,</i> 408 U.S. 238, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> none of the cases is precedent for the government's present position that a defendant who might still be executed can be denied the swift appointment of learned counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So far as we can tell, the only appellate case that directly addresses the precise question before us is the decision in <i>United States v. Boone,</i> 245 F.3d 352 (4th Cir.2001). There, by a two-to-one vote, the Fourth Circuit adopted the view we take of the matter. <i>Compare id.</i> at 358 (Widener, joined by Luttig, <i>Circuit Judges</i>) <i>with</i> 364 (Kiser, <i>Senior District Judge,</i> dissenting). In our view, Judge Kiser's main target &#8212; the case in which the government has permanently disavowed any claim to the death penalty &#8212; presents quite a different problem than the one before us. <i>See also United States v. Grimes,</i> 142 F.3d 1342, 1347 (11th Cir. 1998), <i>cert. denied,</i> 525 U.S. 1088, 119 S.Ct. 840, 142 L.Ed.2d 695 (1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are other cases in which a court has declined to provide to the defense other advantages peculiar to capital cases unless the death penalty is actually sought.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> There may well be situations in which such a distinction makes sense (<i>e.g.,</i> information as to trial witnesses); but in this case there <i>are</i> practical reasons to treat the case as capital from indictment forward, for purposes of appointing learned counsel, until it becomes clear that the death penalty is no longer an option. Words used in statutes, after all, are tools and a phrase like \"capital case\" can mean different things in different contexts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It appeared at oral argument that the United States Attorney in Puerto Rico has already made a recommendation in this case to the Attorney General apparently after considering a submission made by a federal public defender. There is no indication that the Attorney General has yet considered the matter, and we express no views on the consequences that our decision may have on the absence of learned counsel at the time that initial submissions were made to the United States Attorney.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>The writ of mandamus is granted.</i> Learned counsel shall be appointed forthwith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In a certificate required by local rules, the United States identified only one count &#8212; under 18 U.S.C. 924(j) &#8212; as punishable by death</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Absent legislative history, both explanations are speculation but, in support of the latter, we note that, indeed, the 1994 amendments require the court to consider counsel recommendations of the Federal Public Defender organizations or the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3005</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> <i>United States v.

Under the District of Puerto Rico's Local Rule 428(4), lead counsel in a capital case must possess a number of specified qualifications which include prior experience, within the last three years, \"as defense counsel in a capital case.\" The rule also provides that its provision should be implemented by the presiding judge \"at the earliest practical opportunity, once a defendant is charged in a capital case.\" <i>Id.</i> 428(1). The Federal Public Defender's office represents that it does not have a person thus qualified in its office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 9, 2002, the government filed a certificate, as required by local rules, identifying the case as one in which the maximum possible penalty is death. D.P.R. R. 428(2)(A). The decision whether to seek the death penalty is made by the Attorney General, but only after considering the recommendations of the local U.S. attorney and an advisory committee within the Department of Justice. United States Attorneys' Manual &#167; 9-10.020 (June 7, 2001). Under Department of Justice procedures, defense counsel is entitled to make submissions to both the U.S. attorney and the Department, arguing that the Attorney General's discretion should be exercised against seeking the death penalty. <i>Id.</i> &#167;&#167; 9-10.030, 9-10.050.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 24, 2002, during a status conference, petitioner's April 4 request for appointment of learned counsel was denied. The court explained: \"Once the Court receives the decision from the Department of Justice, then learned counsel will be appointed.\" Following the superseding indictment, petitioner asked the district court to reconsider its denial of the motion requesting immediate appointment of learned counsel. On July 8, 2002, the district court denied the motion for reconsideration. Petitioner then sought mandamus from this court to compel the appointment of learned counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily, mandamus is treated as an extraordinary remedy granted only where there is a clear entitlement to relief and threat of irreparable harm. <i>In re Cargill, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196338\"><a href=\"/opinion/196338/in-re-v-cargill-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1256</span></a></span>, 1260 (1st Cir. 1995), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1156</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">648</span></span> (1996). The government points out that if petitioner were convicted and sentenced to death, he would be able to raise his statutory claim on direct appeal and it argues that the statutory claim made by petitioner is at least debatable. Of course, the reality is that once a determination by the Attorney General is made to seek the death penalty, the incentive for defendant to plead guilty in exchange for a term of imprisonment is obvious.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question whether there is a threat of irreparable injury and clear error need not be decided. This is so because this court has authority to grant \"advisory mandamus\" in situations that involve undecided questions of \"great public importance\" that are likely to recur. <i>See United States v. Horn,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"674595\"><a href=\"/opinion/674595/united-states-v-richard-a-horn/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">754</span></a></span>, 769-70 (1st Cir.1994). The occasions for employing advisory mandamus are and should remain extremely rare; the procedure should be reserved only to address questions \"likely of significant repetition prior to effective review\" where guidance from the court will assist other judges, parties or lawyers. <i>In re Bushkin Assocs., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"516170\"><a href=\"/opinion/516170/in-re-bushkin-associates-inc-and-merle-j-bushkin/\"><span class=\"volume\">864</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">241</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1989) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, the question when learned counsel must be appointed in a federal capital case is a recurring question that ought to be settled at the earliest opportunity. Although the question has arisen several times within this circuit, <i>e.g. United States v. Torres G&#243;mez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2410431\"><a href=\"/opinion/2410431/united-states-v-torres-gomez/\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">402</span></a></span>, 407-08 (D.P.R.1999), it has not yet been, but clearly ought to be, definitively resolved by this court. In addition to the obvious interest of the defendant, a speedy resolution also serves the public interest in assuring compliance with the special requirements that Congress has imposed, by statute, for capital cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the merits, statutory language and policy alike support the view that &#8212; in general and without ruling out the possibility of unusual circumstances &#8212; learned counsel is to be appointed reasonably soon after the indictment and prior to the time that submissions are to be made to persuade the Attorney General not to seek the death penalty. As the statute is written, the word \"promptly\" is used in relation to a prior event &#8212; namely, the indictment of the defendant upon a capital crime. Nothing suggests that this appointment is to await the Attorney General's determination to seek the death penalty, although Congress could easily have so provided if it had wanted to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admittedly, the term \"promptly\" is not self-defining; if there were no purpose served by appointing learned counsel until the Attorney General had decided to seek the death penalty one could argue that the appointment should be made promptly <i>when</i> it mattered and not before. But surely in death penalty litigation, special learning in the law \"applicable to capital cases,\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3005, is likely to be especially useful in making and supporting arguments about mitigating and aggravating factors, primarily made at the stage when the Attorney General is determining whether or not to seek the death penalty and (still later) when the jury is determining the sentence. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3591 (special conditions), 3592 (mitigating and aggravating factors) (2000). By contrast, whether the defendant committed the crime is a trial phase issue often little different than those presented in non-capital cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Quite possibly, as the government urges, the submissions to the Attorney General are not matters of right and the Departmental procedures that invite such submissions do not create an entitlement. But our concern here is with a <i>statutory</i> right to learned counsel; and the practical opportunity for learned counsel to persuade the Attorney General casts light on what the word \"promptly\" means in the statute. Similarly, we are not concerned with whether, for purposes of \"the right to counsel\" under the Sixth Amendment, the preliminary submissions are or are not a \"critical\" phase of the proceeding. <i>United States v. Gouveia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111193\"><a href=\"/opinion/111193/united-states-v-gouveia/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">180</span></a></span>, 189, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111193\"><a href=\"/opinion/111193/united-states-v-gouveia/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">146</span></a></span> (1984); <i>compare United States v. Pe&#241;a-Gonz&#225;lez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2410456\"><a href=\"/opinion/2410456/united-states-v-pena-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">358</span></a></span>, 361-64 (D.P.R.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's contrary position on the meaning of \"promptly\" rests on three arguments. The first is that in the 1994 amendments to section 3005, Congress imposed the requirement of counsel \"learned in the law applicable to capital cases,\" and, as to the timing of counsel's appointment, changed \"immediately\" to \"promptly.\" <i>See also Torres G&#243;mez,</i> 62 F.Supp.2d at 407. Nothing indicates that the substitution was meant to authorize a delay until after the Attorney General decided to seek the death penalty. It is equally possible that \"promptly\" was chosen in place of \"immediately\" because securing learned counsel &#8212; especially in a jurisdiction like Puerto Rico that does not have capital punishment for local crimes &#8212; may be a process that takes a reasonable amount of time and can hardly be done \"immediately\" after indictment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's next argument is based upon policy rather than the statute. It argues that securing and compensating learned counsel is an expensive process. A considerable number of cases are eligible for capital punishment but in many the Attorney General decides not to seek the death penalty. This, in the government's view, means that in such cases the appointment of learned counsel will be wasted. This might seem an inhumane argument, but &#8212; in a case where the statutory language were less clear &#8212; a vast expenditure to practically no purpose might well count as an argument against petitioner's interpretation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the argument is faulty. In some cases the early appointment of learned counsel will not be wasted at all but may well make the difference as to whether the Attorney General seeks the death penalty (and perhaps as to whether defendant lives or dies). Further, the submission to the Attorney General is a comparatively informal one and in those cases where the opposition succeeds in persuading the Attorney General not to seek the death penalty, a substantial additional expenditure on the trial and sentencing phase of a capital case is likely to be avoided. There is certainly no indication that requiring employment at the earlier stage will necessarily be a waste of money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the government asserts that the case law is favorable to it because at least three circuits held under the pre-1994 version of section 3005 that (we quote from the government's brief) \"the two-attorney provision did not apply when the defendant did not actually face the death penalty.\" The government says that Congress' enactment of the 1994 amendment, done against the background of these prior interpretations, should be taken to embody the then-existing view of the courts. Yet all three of the cases cited by the government were ones in which the death penalty was no longer available for the defendant because of <i>Furman v. Georgia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108605\"><a href=\"/opinion/108605/furman-v-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108605\"><a href=\"/opinion/108605/furman-v-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

There, by a two-to-one vote, the Fourth Circuit adopted the view we take of the matter. <i>Compare id.</i> at 358 (Widener, joined by Luttig, <i>Circuit Judges</i>) <i>with</i> 364 (Kiser, <i>Senior District Judge,</i> dissenting). In our view, Judge Kiser's main target &#8212; the case in which the government has permanently disavowed any claim to the death penalty &#8212; presents quite a different problem than the one before us. <i>See also United States v. Grimes,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"72982\"><a href=\"/opinion/72982/united-states-v-grimes/\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1342</span></a></span>, 1347 (11th Cir. 1998), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">525</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1088</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Words used in statutes, after all, are tools and a phrase like \"capital case\" can mean different things in different contexts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It appeared at oral argument that the United States Attorney in Puerto Rico has already made a recommendation in this case to the Attorney General apparently after considering a submission made by a federal public defender.
