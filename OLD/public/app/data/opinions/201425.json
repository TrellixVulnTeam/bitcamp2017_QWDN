BACKGROUND\n\n     On   April   24,    2002,     Jose    Oscar    Rodriguez-Reyes,         a    police\n\nofficer   employed      by   the   United       States   Department    of    Veterans\n\nAffairs, was shot and killed while performing his duties as a\n\nuniformed guard at the entrance gate of the Veterans Affairs\n\nHospital in Puerto Rico.           A police investigation revealed that a\n\njuvenile male, E.L.C., and another man, Carlos Ayala Lopez, were\n\narmed and approached the guard shack at the entrance                             of   the\n\nveterans hospital.           Their plan appears to have               been       to take\n\nOfficer Rodriguez’s gun.           Moments after they arrived at the guard\n\nshack, Officer Rodriguez was shot and killed.\n\n      Five days after officer Rodriguez was killed, on April 29,\n\n2002, a man, described only as a Dominican national, was also\n\nkilled in the course of a robbery.                 On May 10, 2002, E.L.C. was\n\narrested and charged with four acts of delinquency before the\n\ncourt for the Superior Part of Carolina, Puerto Rico, related to\n\nthe attempted robbery and murder of the Dominican man.                            At the\n\ntime of his arrest, E.L.C. was in possession of a gun, which\n\nballistic tests later revealed was the same gun that had killed\n\nOfficer   Rodriguez      and   the    Dominican      man   on   April    29,       2002.\n\nE.L.C. was adjudicated and sentenced in the Commonwealth court to\n\n\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\f18 months in the Humacao Detention Center on the charges arising\n\nout of the robbery and murder of the Dominican man.\n\n       In March 2003, E.L.C. was federally charged in a two-count\n\nsealed      Information        with      aiding      and   abetting      in     the    unlawful\n\nkilling      of     a     federal        police      officer.           Specifically,         the\n\nInformation        charged         the     killing    of   a    federal       officer    in    an\n\nattempt to perpetrate a robbery that, if he were an adult, would\n\nbe in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1111, 1114, 2, and carrying and\n\nusing a weapon in relation to a crime of violence that, if he\n\nwere an adult, would be in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 924(c) &\n\n(j), 2.\n\n       The    United      States         Attorney     certified        that    E.L.C.    was    a\n\njuvenile and that there was a “substantial federal interest” in\n\nthe   case    and       the   offenses        warranted        the    exercise    of    federal\n\njurisdiction.           Appellant was fifteen years and 9 months old at\n\nthe   time    of    the       charged       offense.       The       Government       moved    to\n\ntransfer E.L.C. to adult status for prosecution.                              E.L.C. objected\n\nto    the    transfer.             After    receiving      the       Puerto    Rico    juvenile\n\ncourt’s      records      and      the     psychological        evaluation       report,      the\n\nmagistrate judge held a hearing on the government's motion to\n\ntransfer      E.L.C.          to     the      district         court's        adult    criminal\n\njurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 5032.                             After hearing from\n\nthe    clinical         psychologist         who     evaluated       E.L.C.     and    the    FBI\n\n                                               -3-\n\fSpecial        Agent     involved       in        the     investigation         of    Officer\n\nRodriguez’s          death,    the    magistrate        judge    issued     a    Report    and\n\nRecommendation, which recommended that E.L.C. be transferred to\n\nadult       status    for     prosecution.          The      district   court     thereafter\n\ndenied       E.L.C.’s       objections       to     the      Recommended    Decision       and\n\nadopted       the    magistrate       judge's      recommendation        that     E.L.C.    be\n\ntransferred to adult status.1                 Appellant subsequently filed this\n\nexpedited interlocutory appeal challenging the district court's\n\ntransfer order.\n\nII.     DISCUSSION\n\n        This Court has jurisdiction over this case under 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1291.\n\n        The decision to transfer a juvenile to be prosecuted as an\n\nadult is reviewed for abuse of discretion.                              United States v.\n\nSmith,       178 F.3d 22, 26 (1st Cir. 1999). “The district court\n\nabuses its discretion ‘when it fails to make the required ...\n\nfindings       or     where     the    findings         it    does   make       are   clearly\n\nerroneous.’”          United States v. Doe, 94 F.3d 532, 536 (9th Cir.\n\n1996)(quoting United States v. Nelson, 68 F.3d 583, 588 (2d Cir.\n\n1995)).\n\n\n\n        1\n      The District Court adopted the recommendation of the\nMagistrate Judge without comment. All references will, therefore,\nbe to the Magistrate Judge’s Report and Recommended Decision.\n\n                                              -4-\n\f      The purpose of the federal juvenile delinquency process is\n\nto “remove juveniles from the ordinary criminal process in order\n\nto   avoid    the    stigma     of   a    prior    criminal     conviction    and    to\n\nencourage treatment and rehabilitation.”                  United States v. Female\n\nJuvenile,     A.F.S.,     377   F.3d      27,    32-33   (1st   Cir.    2004)(quoting\n\nUnited    States     v.   Brian      N.,     900   F.2d    218,   220    (10th     Cir.\n\n1990)(citations omitted)).               The district court must balance these\n\nimportant interests against “the need to protect the public from\n\nviolent      and    dangerous    individuals.”            See   United    States     v.\n\nJuvenile Male # 1, 47 F.3d 68, 71 (2d Cir. 1995); see also United\n\nStates v. One Juvenile Male, 40 F.3d 841, 844 (6th Cir. 1994).\n\nThere is a presumption in favor of juvenile adjudication and,\n\ntherefore, the burden is on the government to establish that\n\ntransfer to adult status is warranted.                    Female Juvenile A.F.S.,\n\n377 F.3d at 32 (quoting Juvenile Male # 1, 47 F.3d at 71).\n\n      A juvenile who is alleged to have committed an act which, if\n\ncommitted by an adult, would be a felony that is a crime of\n\nviolence, may be proceeded against as an adult by means of a\n\ntransfer to adult court if the district court determines that it\n\nwould be “in the interest of justice” to do so.                          18 U.S.C. §\n\n5032.     In determining whether a transfer would be in the interest\n\nof justice, Congress provided six factors to guide the district\n\ncourt:\n\n                                           -5-\n\f       [1] the age and social background of the juvenile; [2]\n       the nature of the alleged offense; [3] the extent and\n       nature of the juvenile's prior delinquency record; [4]\n       the juvenile's present intellectual development and\n       psychological   maturity;  [5]   the  nature  of  past\n       treatment efforts and the juvenile's response to such\n       efforts; [6] the availability of programs designed to\n       treat the juvenile's behavioral problems.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 5032.          The district court must consider and make\n\nfindings with respect to each factor.               Id.        The district court\n\nneed not find that each factor weighs in favor of transfer in\n\norder to grant the Government’s motion.                  Other Circuit Courts,\n\nincluding this one, have held that the district court need not\n\neven   find   that    a   majority   of   factors      weigh    in   favor   of    the\n\nprevailing party, as “it is not required to give equal weight to\n\neach factor but ‘may balance them as it deems appropriate.’”\n\nUnited   States      v.   Leon   D.M.,    132   F.3d    583,     589   (10th      Cir.\n\n1997)(quoting Juvenile Male # 1, 47 F.3d at 71); see also United\n\nStates v. Wilson, 149 F.3d 610, 614 (7th Cir. 1998); United\n\nStates v. Juvenile JG, 139 F.3d 584, 586-87 (8th Cir. 1998); Leon\n\nD.M., 132 F.3d at 589; United States v. Wellington, 102 F.3d 499,\n\n506 (11th Cir. 1996); Doe, 94 F.3d at 537; Juvenile Male # 1, 47\n\nF.3d at 71; United States v. One Juvenile Male, 40 F.3d 841,\n\n845-46 (6th Cir. 1994); United States v. A.R., 38 F.3d 699, 705\n\n(3d Cir. 1994); United States v. Doe, 871 F.2d 1248, 1254-55 (5th\n\n\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fCir. 1989); United States v. Hemmer, 729 F.2d 10, 17 (1st Cir.\n\n1984).\n\n     The decision on whether to transfer a young individual to\n\nadult status for prosecution is in most instances a difficult one\n\nas   it   can     have    severe   consequences    for     a    juvenile’s\n\nrehabilitation.    Although the court must address each factor, the\n\ndistrict court “is not required to state whether each specific\n\nfactor favors or disfavors transfer.”        Leon D.M., 132 F.3d at 589\n\n(citing United States v. Three Male Juveniles, 49 F.3d 1058, 1061\n\n(5th Cir. 1995)).        Rather, the court must balance the evidence\n\nbefore it, weighing each factor as it sees fit, to determine\n\nwhether a transfer to adult status best serves “the interest of\n\njustice.” 18 U.S.C. § 5032.         The analytical balancing of the\n\ntransfer factors cannot be expressed mathematically.           See Wilson,\n\n149 F.3d at 614.\n\n     A review of the magistrate judge’s decision reveals that she\n\nconsidered each of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 5032.\n\nBecause the magistrate judge made the requisite findings, the\n\nfirst issue for this Court to consider is whether any of those\n\nfindings are clearly erroneous.          To that end, we have reviewed\n\nthe transcript of the transfer hearing and the written report of\n\nthe clinical psychologist who examined E.L.C.            We conclude that\n\nnone of the magistrate judge’s findings on the six factors show\n\n                                   -7-\n\fclear    error,         and    the      factors       were       reasonably    weighed         in    the\n\ncircumstances of this case.\n\n     E.L.C.            argues       that        the       magistrate        judge        erroneously\n\nconsidered his participation in the robbery and murder of the\n\nDominican man, which occurred subsequent to the murder of Officer\n\nRodriguez, in weighing the third transfer factor – the extent and\n\nnature       of     the      juvenile's        prior       delinquency        record.           E.L.C.\n\npresented a similar argument – that subsequent bad acts cannot be\n\nconsidered in weighing a defendant’s prior delinquency record –\n\nbefore the magistrate judge and in response the magistrate judge\n\nstated       that      “even       if   not    to     be       considered    under       the    ‘prior\n\nconviction’         category,           [it]    may       be    properly    considered          within\n\nE.L.C.’s          social      background            and    his     responses        to     treatment\n\nefforts.”          Report and Recommendation at 7.                      The magistrate judge\n\nconcluded that “under either factor, the actions underlying the\n\nstate charges constitutes conduct that favors transfer.”                                       Id.\n\n        We    do       not     think      that        “prior      delinquency        record”         can\n\nplausibly         be    interpreted            to    encompass       criminal       conduct          that\n\noccurred          after      the    charged         acts.          However,    section          5032's\n\nrequirement that mentation be given to all six named transfer\n\nfactors, does not preclude the district court from considering\n\nother unnamed factors that are relevant to the determination of\n\nwhether the juvenile’s transfer would be in “the interest of\n\n                                                    -8-\n\fjustice.”          In this case, the seriousness and similarity of the\n\nsubsequent         criminal    acts    to    the     circumstances       of    the    charged\n\noffenses, as well as the fact that those acts occurred just five\n\ndays       after     Officer        Rodriguez        was      killed,     justify          their\n\nconsideration in the overall interest of justice assessment.2\n\n       The Court notes that although the magistrate judge discussed\n\nthe    subsequent       criminal      conduct        under    the   heading      of    “prior\n\ndelinquency,”         it    appears         that     she     concluded     that       it     was\n\nappropriate to consider subsequent criminal activity under either\n\nthe social background factor or responses to treatment efforts\n\nfactor.3       However, even if it was considered under the prior\n\njuvenile delinquency category, there was no error.                               This is so\n\nbecause      the    Court     finds    that        E.L.C.’s    criminal       conduct       that\n\noccurred      subsequent       to     the    crime     charged      in    this    case       was\n\nproperly      considered        as     bearing        on     E.L.C.’s     potential          for\n\nrehabilitation in the juvenile justice system.                           Recognizing that\n\nthe transfer factors are weighed and not numerically tallied, the\n\n\n       2\n     Our holding, on the exceptional facts of this case, should not\nbe understood to require the consideration of subsequent criminal\nacts in all circumstances.\n       3\n      This Court considers that the plain language of either of two\ntransfer factors – “the juvenile's present intellectual development\nand psychological maturity,\" and \"the age and social background of\nthe juvenile,\" – is broad enough to authorize the consideration of\nevidence regarding E.L.C.’s criminal activities subsequent to the\ncharged offense.\n\n                                              -9-\n\finaccurate categorization           of    the consideration of the conduct\n\ndoes not result in error.\n\n      Appellant E.L.C. also argues that the magistrate judge gave\n\nexcessive   weight       to   the   nature       of   the   alleged   offense.    As\n\ndiscussed above, the weight to be given each factor is left to\n\nthe   discretion    of    the   district     court.         The   magistrate   judge\n\nconsidered and made factual findings as to all six statutory\n\nfactors.4      None of those factual findings is clearly erroneous.\n\nThe gravity of the crimes charged warrants their consideration as\n\na   weighted    factor    in    the      transfer     analysis.       Even   if   the\n\nmagistrate judge relied primarily on the serious nature of the\n\ncharged offense conduct, such reliance does not invalidate the\n\nanalysis. The magistrate judge did not abuse her discretion under\n\n\n      4\n     One week prior to oral argument in this case, Appellant filed\na “Motion to Complement Appellant’s Argument During Scheduled\nHearing.”    With one exception, the Motion asserts the same\narguments that Appellant relied upon in his brief.      The single\ndistinct challenge is that the magistrate judge failed to evaluate\nthe possibilities and alternatives available for E.L.C.’s\nrehabilitation.\n\n     It is clearly established in this Circuit that, in the absence\nof exceptional circumstances, arguments which could have been\ntimely raised, but were not, will be rejected.          See, e.g.,\nSandstrom v. ChemLawn Corp., 904 F.2d 83, 87 (1st Cir. 1990).\nWithout doubt, Appellant’s supplemental arguments all could have\nbeen raised in his original brief. Nevertheless, it is evident\nfrom the record that the magistrate judge examined the alternatives\nfor E.L.C.’s rehabilitation and concluded, based on the\npsychologist’s report, that the adult system is better equipped to\nprovide E.L.C. with the programs he needs.\n\n                                          -10-\n\fthe statute in weighing the transfer factors and in determining\n\nthat E.L.C.’s transfer to adult status was in the interest of\n\njustice within the meaning of § 5032.   Accordingly, the order of\n\nthe district court is AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                              -11-\n\f",

BACKGROUND</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 24, 2002, Jose Oscar Rodriguez-Reyes, a police officer employed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, was shot and killed while performing his duties as a uniformed guard at the entrance gate of the Veterans Affairs Hospital in Puerto Rico. A police investigation revealed that a juvenile male, E.L.C., and another man, Carlos Ayala Lopez, were armed and approached the guard shack at the entrance of the veterans hospital. Their plan appears to have been to take Officer Rodriguez's gun. Moments after they arrived at the guard shack, Officer Rodriguez was shot and killed.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Five days after officer Rodriguez was killed, on April 29, 2002, a man, described only as a Dominican national, was also killed in the course of a robbery. On May 10, 2002, E.L.C. was arrested and charged with four acts of delinquency before the court for the Superior Part of Carolina, Puerto Rico, related to the attempted robbery and murder of the Dominican man. At the time of his arrest, E.L.C. was in possession of a gun, which ballistic tests later revealed was the same gun that had killed Officer Rodriguez and the Dominican man on April 29, 2002. E.L.C. was adjudicated and sentenced in the Commonwealth court to 18 months in the Humacao Detention Center on the charges arising out of the robbery and murder of the Dominican man.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 2003, E.L.C. was federally charged in a two-count sealed Information with aiding and abetting in the unlawful killing of a federal police officer. Specifically, the Information charged the killing of a federal officer in an attempt to perpetrate a robbery that, if he were an adult, would be in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1111, 1114, 2, and carrying and using a weapon in relation to a crime of violence that, if he were an adult, would be in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 924(c) &amp; (j), 2.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States Attorney certified that E.L.C. was a juvenile and that there was a \"substantial federal interest\" in the case and the offenses warranted the exercise of federal jurisdiction. Appellant was fifteen years and 9 months old at the time of the charged offense. The Government moved to transfer E.L.C. to adult status for prosecution. E.L.C. objected to the transfer. After receiving the Puerto Rico juvenile court's records and the psychological evaluation report, the magistrate judge held a hearing on the government's motion to transfer E.L.C. to the district court's adult criminal jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 5032. After hearing from the clinical psychologist who evaluated E.L.C. and the FBI Special Agent involved in the investigation of Officer Rodriguez's death, the magistrate judge issued a Report and Recommendation, which recommended that E.L.C. be transferred to adult status for prosecution. The district court thereafter denied E.L.C.'s objections to the Recommended Decision and adopted the magistrate judge's recommendation that E.L.C. be transferred to adult status.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Appellant subsequently filed this expedited interlocutory appeal challenging the district court's transfer order.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Court has jurisdiction over this case under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision to transfer a juvenile to be prosecuted as an adult is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Smith,</i> 178 F.3d 22, 26 (1st Cir.1999). \"The district court abuses its discretion `when it fails to make the required... findings or where the findings it does make are clearly erroneous.'\" <i>United States v. Doe,</i> 94 F.3d 532, 536 (9th Cir.1996)(quoting <i>United States v. Nelson,</i> 68 F.3d 583, 588 (2d Cir.1995)).</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The purpose of the federal juvenile delinquency process is to \"remove juveniles from the ordinary criminal process in order to avoid the stigma of a prior criminal conviction and to encourage treatment and rehabilitation.\" <i>United States v. Female Juvenile, A.F.S.,</i> 377 F.3d 27, 32-33 (1st Cir.2004)(quoting <i>United States v. Brian N.,</i> 900 F.2d 218, 220 (10th Cir.1990) (citations omitted)). The district court must balance these important interests against \"the need to protect the public from violent and dangerous individuals.\" <i>See United States v. Juvenile Male # 1,</i> 47 F.3d 68, 71 (2d Cir.1995); <i>see also United States v. One Juvenile Male,</i> 40 F.3d 841, 844 (6th Cir.1994). There is a presumption in favor of juvenile adjudication and, therefore, the burden is on the government to establish that transfer to adult status is warranted. <i>Female Juvenile A.F.S.,</i> 377 F.3d at 32 (quoting <i>Juvenile Male # 1,</i> 47 F.3d at 71).</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A juvenile who is alleged to have committed an act which, if committed by an adult, would be a felony that is a crime of violence, may be proceeded against as an adult by means of a transfer to adult court if the district court determines that it would be \"in the interest of justice\" to do so. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 5032. In determining whether a transfer would be in the interest of justice, Congress provided six factors to guide the district court:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[1] the age and social background of the juvenile; [2] the nature of the alleged offense; [3] the extent and nature of the juvenile's prior delinquency record; [4] the juvenile's present intellectual development and psychological maturity; [5] the nature of past treatment efforts and the juvenile's response to such efforts; [6] the availability of programs designed to treat the juvenile's behavioral problems.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 5032. The district court must consider and make findings with respect to each factor. <i>Id.</i> The district court need not find that each factor weighs in favor of transfer in order to grant the Government's motion. Other Circuit Courts, including this one, have held that the district court need not even find that a majority of factors weigh in favor of the prevailing party, as \"it is not required to give equal weight to each factor but `may balance them as it deems appropriate.'\" <i>United States v. Leon D.M.,</i> 132 F.3d 583, 589 (10th Cir.1997)(quoting <i>Juvenile Male # 1,</i> 47 F.3d at 71); see also <i>United States v. Wilson,</i> 149 F.3d 610, 614 (7th Cir.1998); <i>United States v. Juvenile JG,</i> 139 F.3d 584, 586-87 (8th Cir.1998); <i>Leon D.M.,</i> 132 F.3d at 589; <i>United States v. Wellington,</i> 102 F.3d 499, 506 (11th Cir.1996); <i>Doe,</i> 94 F.3d at 537; <i>Juvenile Male # 1,</i> 47 F.3d at 71; <i>United States v. One Juvenile Male,</i> 40 F.3d 841, 845-46 (6th Cir.1994); <i>United States v. A.R.,</i> 38 F.3d 699, 705 (3d Cir.1994); <i>United States v. Doe,</i> 871 F.2d 1248, 1254-55 (5th Cir.1989); <i>United States v. Hemmer,</i> 729 F.2d 10, 17 (1st Cir.1984).</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision on whether to transfer a young individual to adult status for prosecution is in most instances a difficult one as it can have severe consequences for a juvenile's rehabilitation. Although the court must address each factor, the district court \"is not required to state whether each specific factor favors or disfavors transfer.\" <i>Leon D.M.,</i> 132 F.3d at 589 (citing <i>United States v. Three Male Juveniles,</i> 49 F.3d 1058, 1061 (5th Cir.1995)). Rather, the court must balance the evidence before it, weighing each factor as it sees fit, to determine whether a transfer to adult status best serves \"the interest of justice.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 5032. The analytical balancing of the transfer factors cannot be expressed mathematically. <i>See Wilson,</i> 149 F.3d at 614.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A review of the magistrate judge's decision reveals that she considered each of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 5032. Because the magistrate judge made the requisite findings, the first issue for this Court to consider is whether any of those findings are clearly erroneous. To that end, we have reviewed the transcript of the transfer hearing and the written report of the clinical psychologist who examined E.L.C. We conclude that none of the magistrate judge's findings on the six factors show clear error, and the factors were reasonably weighed in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">E.L.C. argues that the magistrate judge erroneously considered his participation in the robbery and murder of the Dominican man, which occurred subsequent to the murder of Officer Rodriguez, in weighing the third transfer factor &#8212; the extent and nature of the juvenile's prior delinquency record. E.L.C. presented a similar argument &#8212; that subsequent bad acts cannot be considered in weighing a defendant's prior delinquency record &#8212; before the magistrate judge and in response the magistrate judge stated that \"even if not to be considered under the `prior conviction' category, [it] may be properly considered within E.L.C.'s social background and his responses to treatment efforts.\" Report and Recommendation at 7. The magistrate judge concluded that \"under either factor, the actions underlying the state charges constitutes conduct that favors transfer.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not think that \"prior delinquency record\" can plausibly be interpreted to encompass criminal conduct that occurred after the charged acts. However, section 5032's requirement that mentation be given to all six named transfer factors, does not preclude the district court from considering other unnamed factors that are relevant to the determination of whether the juvenile's transfer would be in \"the interest of justice.\" In this case, the seriousness and similarity of the subsequent criminal acts to the circumstances of the charged offenses, as well as the fact that those acts occurred just five days after Officer Rodriguez was killed, justify their consideration in the overall interest of justice assessment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court notes that although the magistrate judge discussed the subsequent criminal conduct under the heading of \"prior delinquency,\" it appears that she concluded that it was appropriate to consider subsequent criminal activity under either the social background factor or responses to treatment efforts factor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> However, even if it was considered under the prior juvenile delinquency category, there was no error. This is so because the Court finds that E.L.C.'s criminal conduct that occurred subsequent to the crime charged in this case was properly considered as bearing on E.L.C.'s potential for rehabilitation in the juvenile justice system. Recognizing that the transfer factors are weighed and not numerically tallied, the inaccurate categorization of the consideration of the conduct does not result in error.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant E.L.C. also argues that the magistrate judge gave excessive weight to the nature of the alleged offense. As discussed above, the weight to be given each factor is left to the discretion of the district court. The magistrate judge considered and made factual findings as to all six statutory factors.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> None of those factual findings is clearly erroneous. The gravity of the crimes charged warrants their consideration as a weighted factor in the transfer analysis. Even if the magistrate judge relied primarily on the serious nature of the charged offense conduct, such reliance does not invalidate the analysis. The magistrate judge did not abuse her discretion under the statute in weighing the transfer factors and in determining that E.L.C.'s transfer to adult status was in the interest of justice within the meaning of &#167; 5032. Accordingly, the order of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Maine, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The District Court adopted the recommendation of the Magistrate Judge without comment.

The single distinct challenge is that the magistrate judge failed to evaluate the possibilities and alternatives available for E.L.C.'s rehabilitation</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">It is clearly established in this Circuit that, in the absence of exceptional circumstances, arguments which could have been timely raised, but were not, will be rejected. <i>See, e.g., Sandstrom v. ChemLawn Corp.,</i> 904 F.2d 83, 87 (1st Cir.1990). Without doubt, Appellant's supplemental arguments all could have been raised in his original brief. Nevertheless, it is evident from the record that the magistrate judge examined the alternatives for E.L.C.'s rehabilitation and concluded, based on the psychologist's report, that the adult system is better equipped to provide E.L.C. with the programs he needs.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Although the court must address each factor, the district court \"is not required to state whether each specific factor favors or disfavors transfer.\" <i>Leon D.M.,</i> 132 F.3d at 589 (citing <i>United States v. Three Male Juveniles,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"7056\"><a href=\"/opinion/7056/united-states-v-three-male-juveniles/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1058</span></a></span>, 1061 (5th Cir.1995)). Rather, the court must balance the evidence before it, weighing each factor as it sees fit, to determine whether a transfer to adult status best serves \"the interest of justice.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 5032. The analytical balancing of the transfer factors cannot be expressed mathematically. <i>See Wilson,</i> 149 F.3d at 614.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A review of the magistrate judge's decision reveals that she considered each of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 5032. Because the magistrate judge made the requisite findings, the first issue for this Court to consider is whether any of those findings are clearly erroneous. To that end, we have reviewed the transcript of the transfer hearing and the written report of the clinical psychologist who examined E.L.C. We conclude that none of the magistrate judge's findings on the six factors show clear error, and the factors were reasonably weighed in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">E.L.C. argues that the magistrate judge erroneously considered his participation in the robbery and murder of the Dominican man, which occurred subsequent to the murder of Officer Rodriguez, in weighing the third transfer factor &#8212; the extent and nature of the juvenile's prior delinquency record. E.L.C. presented a similar argument &#8212; that subsequent bad acts cannot be considered in weighing a defendant's prior delinquency record &#8212; before the magistrate judge and in response the magistrate judge stated that \"even if not to be considered under the `prior conviction' category, [it] may be properly considered within E.L.C.'s social background and his responses to treatment efforts.\" Report and Recommendation at 7. The magistrate judge concluded that \"under either factor, the actions underlying the state charges constitutes conduct that favors transfer.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not think that \"prior delinquency record\" can plausibly be interpreted to encompass criminal conduct that occurred after the charged acts. However, section 5032's requirement that mentation be given to all six named transfer factors, does not preclude the district court from considering other unnamed factors that are relevant to the determination of whether the juvenile's transfer would be in \"the interest of justice.\" In this case, the seriousness and similarity of the subsequent criminal acts to the circumstances of the charged offenses, as well as the fact that those acts occurred just five days after Officer Rodriguez was killed, justify their consideration in the overall interest of justice assessment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court notes that although the magistrate judge discussed the subsequent criminal conduct under the heading of \"prior delinquency,\" it appears that she concluded that it was appropriate to consider subsequent criminal activity under either the social background factor or responses to treatment efforts factor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> However, even if it was considered under the prior juvenile delinquency category, there was no error. This is so because the Court finds that E.L.C.'s criminal conduct that occurred subsequent to the crime charged in this case was properly considered as bearing on E.L.C.'s potential for rehabilitation in the juvenile justice system. Recognizing that the transfer factors are weighed and not numerically tallied, the inaccurate categorization of the consideration of the conduct does not result in error.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant E.L.C. also argues that the magistrate judge gave excessive weight to the nature of the alleged offense. As discussed above, the weight to be given each factor is left to the discretion of the district court. The magistrate judge considered and made factual findings as to all six statutory factors.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> None of those factual findings is clearly erroneous. The gravity of the crimes charged warrants their consideration as a weighted factor in the transfer analysis. Even if the magistrate judge relied primarily on the serious nature of the charged offense conduct, such reliance does not invalidate the analysis. The magistrate judge did not abuse her discretion under the statute in weighing the transfer factors and in determining that E.L.C.'s transfer to adult status was in the interest of justice within the meaning of &#167; 5032. Accordingly, the order of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Maine, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The District Court adopted the recommendation of the Magistrate Judge without comment. All references will, therefore, be to the Magistrate Judge's Report and Recommended Decision</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Our holding, on the exceptional facts of this case, should not be understood to require the consideration of subsequent criminal acts in all circumstances</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> This Court considers that the plain language of either of two transfer factors &#8212; \"the juvenile's present intellectual development and psychological maturity,\" and \"the age and social background of the juvenile,\" &#8212; is broad enough to authorize the consideration of evidence regarding E.L.C.'s criminal activities subsequent to the charged offense</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> One week prior to oral argument in this case, Appellant filed a \"Motion to Complement Appellant's Argument During Scheduled Hearing.\" With one exception, the Motion asserts the same arguments that Appellant relied upon in his brief. The single distinct challenge is that the magistrate judge failed to evaluate the possibilities and alternatives available for E.L.C.'s rehabilitation</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">It is clearly established in this Circuit that, in the absence of exceptional circumstances, arguments which could have been timely raised, but were not, will be rejected. <i>See, e.g., Sandstrom v. ChemLawn Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"542293\"><a href=\"/opinion/542293/richard-l-sandstrom-etc-v-chemlawn-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">904</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, 87 (1st Cir.1990). Without doubt, Appellant's supplemental arguments all could have been raised in his original brief. Nevertheless, it is evident from the record that the magistrate judge examined the alternatives for E.L.C.'s rehabilitation and concluded, based on the psychologist's report, that the adult system is better equipped to provide E.L.C. with the programs he needs.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
