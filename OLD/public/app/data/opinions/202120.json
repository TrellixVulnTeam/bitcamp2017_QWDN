In this case, the primary plaintiff, a\n\ndisabled youth, charges the defendants (all public entities or\n\nofficials) with disability discrimination.1 After a lengthy period\n\nof pretrial discovery, the district court wrote a thoughtful\n\nrescript granting the defendants' motion for summary judgment.\n\nVargas Alicea v. Consortium Mayaguez/Las Marias, 360 F. Supp. 2d\n\n367 (D.P.R. 2005).   This appeal followed.\n\n          We have stated before, and today reaffirm, that when a\n\ntrial court accurately takes the measure of a case, applies the\n\nappropriate legal rules, and articulates a convincing rationale,\n\n\"an appellate court should refrain from writing at length to no\n\nother end than to hear its own words resonate.\"       Lawton v.

Co.\n\n(In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig.), 989 F.2d 36, 38\n\n(1st Cir. 1993), and the case at hand fits neatly within that\n\nintegument.

The question,\n\nrather, is whether there is sufficient evidence that either the\n\nwaiver    requirement    or   the   failure   to   procure   the   waiver   was\n\nattributable to disability discrimination.            On this record, that\n\nquestion must be answered in the negative.\n\n            We need go no further.            Having perused the briefs,\n\nentertained oral argument, and carefully canvassed the record, we,\n\nlike the district court, find no significantly probative evidence\n\nsufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact on the\n\nquestion of discriminatory animus.            Accordingly, the defendants\n\nwere, as the district court ruled, entitled to judgment as a matter\n\nof law.\n\nAffirmed.    No Costs.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\f",
