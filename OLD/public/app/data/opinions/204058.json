MacDonnell.\n     Deborah I. Ecker, with whom Deidre Brennan Regan and Brody,\nHardoon, Perkins & Kesten, LLP, were on brief for appellee Town of\nStow.\n\n\n                         November 9, 2009\n\f           HOWARD,     Circuit    Judge.       Similar    to    other    states,\n\nMassachusetts provides tax relief to landowners of agricultural,\n\nhorticultural or forest land. When such land is converted to other\n\nuses, the Commonwealth requires landowners to compensate their\n\nrespective municipalities.        The compensation may be take the form\n\nof, for example, payment of a conveyance tax when the land is sold,\n\nor payment of roll-back taxes if the land otherwise ceases to\n\nqualify for preferential tax treatment.          In addition to these tax\n\nfeatures, Massachusetts law also provides that once a landowner\n\ndecides   to    sell    the      land    for   other     than    agricultural,\n\nhorticultural, or as relevant here, forest uses, the municipality\n\nis entitled to a right of first refusal (\"ROFR\").               Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nch. 61.   This ROFR provides the municipality with a 120-day period\n\nin which to meet a bona fide offer to purchase the land.                     The\n\nmunicipality thus has the right but not the obligation to preserve\n\nsalutary land uses by purchasing land that the landowner desires to\n\nsell, and the   landowner receives the compensation that a willing\n\nbuyer in an arm's-length transaction is prepared to pay.\n\n           In   this    case,    plaintiff-appellant       Marilyn      Kunelius\n\naccepted a bona fide offer to purchase a parcel of land, which\n\nincluded acreage that had been certified under Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\n\n61 as forest land.     Pursuant to the statute, the Town of Stow chose\n\nto exercise its ROFR.     In addition, the Town assigned this right,\n\nas also permitted by the statute, to the Trust for Public Land\n\n                                        -2-\n\f(\"TPL\" or \"Trust\"), a nonprofit conservation organization.             From\n\nthe beginning, it was clear that a number of circumstances had to\n\nalign in a precise constellation for the Trust and the Town to\n\nconsummate the transaction.        Despite potential difficulties with\n\nthe transaction, the Town and TPL nevertheless went through with\n\nthe assignment of the ROFR.             The Trust's optimistic hopes for\n\nobtaining private philanthropy, state grants, and local zoning\n\nrelief, however, were not fulfilled.         As a result, the Town and the\n\nTrust   failed    to   complete   the    transaction.   In   the    interim,\n\nKunelius's previous buyer chose to develop other land.\n\n           Conceding that it had breached its obligations under its\n\ncontract with Kunelius, the Trust paid liquidated damages in the\n\namount specified in the purchase and sale contract that had been\n\nnegotiated between Kunelius and her original buyer.                Kunelius,\n\nhowever, believing that she was entitled to significantly more,\n\nbrought suit in the district court.          The complaint sought several\n\nspecies of relief, including the invalidation of the liquidated\n\ndamages clause, specific performance or full contract damages,\n\nremedies for the Town and Trust's breach of the covenant of good\n\nfaith and fair dealing, relief under the business-to-business\n\nprovisions of Chapter 93A, and relief under the Contracts Clause of\n\nthe United States Constitution.            On cross-motions for summary\n\njudgment, the district court granted summary judgment to all of the\n\ndefendants:      the Town, the Trust, an alleged partnership between\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fthe Town and Trust, and Trust employee Craig MacDonnell.    Kunelius\n\nnow appeals.\n\n                           I.   Background\n\n          By and large, the facts are not in dispute, but to the\n\nextent that they are, we recite them in the light most favorable to\n\nthe non-moving party, here, the appellant.     See Essex Ins. Co. v.\n\nBloomSouth Flooring Corp., 562 F.3d 399, 401 (1st Cir. 2009);\n\nCoxCom, Inc. v. Chaffee, 536 F.3d 101, 108 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n                   A.   The Original Transaction\n\n          Beginning in 2001, Kunelius sought to sell her horse farm\n\nlocated at 142 and 144 Red Acre Road in Stow, Massachusetts.     The\n\nland abuts two conservation areas, the Red Acre Woods conservation\n\narea and the Captain Sargent conservation area, and it sits atop\n\nthe Town's largest aquifer.     The total land area of this parcel is\n\napproximately 50.67 acres, 42.1 acres of which had been designated\n\nas forest land since 1985, pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 61 § 2.\n\nUpon the remainder of the parcel (approximately 8.57 acres) sit a\n\nmain house and a caretaker's house, as well as the accouterments of\n\na horse farm, including a paddock, barn, and other improvements.\n\n          In mid-2002, Kunelius entered into negotiations with\n\nCohousing Resources LLC (\"Cohousing\"), a consulting company based\n\nin the state of Washington that assists local communities in\n\nforming and developing co-housing projects.      Co-housing projects\n\nlike the one Cohousing contemplated here place an emphasis on open\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fspace and communal living.       Because Cohousing requires the groups\n\non whose behalf it undertakes development to commit to a certain\n\nthreshold level of funding before Cohousing becomes involved,\n\nCohousing's projects have a relatively high probability of coming\n\nto fruition.    Through extensive negotiation and personal contact,\n\nKunelius, her attorney and her real estate agent came to trust\n\nCohousing and its principal representative, Chris ScottHansen.                As\n\na result, Kunelius was comfortable offering terms to Cohousing that\n\nshe may not have offered to another counterparty.\n\n          Cohousing's initial offer was for a purchase price of\n\n$1.1 million, with a deposit of $50,000 to be held in escrow\n\npending closing.      In this first signed offer, the only contingency\n\nwas an evaluation of the property's suitability for the eventual\n\nconstruction of a thirty-unit development.               The offer contained a\n\nprovision that permitted the seller to select from a range of\n\nremedies in the event of the buyer's breach:\n\n          Upon default by Buyer, Seller, at its sole\n          option, may (i) retain the deposit as\n          liquidated damages as its sole remedy, or (ii)\n          repay   the   deposit   to   the   Buyer   and\n          subsequently enforce this Agreement and pursue\n          any and all remedies available at law or\n          equity, including an action for specific\n          performance and damages.\n\n          This offer was not accepted, and negotiations continued.\n\nCohousing's    next    offer   was   for    the   same   purchase   price,   but\n\ncontemplated    that    Kunelius     would    provide      substantial   seller\n\nfinancing.     In addition, the deposit amount was reduced to only\n\n                                      -5-\n\f$10,000 up front and a payment of $1,500 per month thereafter.                            The\n\nrecord suggests that the monthly payment was to replace Kunelius's\n\nhorse    farm    income,         because      her    customers       would      likely   look\n\nelsewhere       to    board      their     horses.          After    a    period   for    the\n\nfeasibility study, Kunelius was free to make use of the deposits.\n\n            This revised offer also specifically contemplated the\n\nprobability that Cohousing would file an application for relief\n\nfrom local zoning requirements, invoking the streamlined approval\n\nprocess for affordable housing set forth in Chapter 40B of the\n\nMassachusetts General Laws.                See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40B §§ 20-23.\n\nIn view of the anticipated approval process, the time for closing\n\non this offer was approximately two years.\n\n            At       Kunelius's     request,         this    revised      offer,   although\n\nwritten     to       include     all     of    her    property,          contemplated     the\n\npossibility          that   \"a    significant         portion       of    the   undeveloped\n\nland . . . not to exceed 42 acres may be encumbered by or deeded to\n\nthe Town of Stow,\" and that this encumbrance or transfer was to\n\noccur after all 40B approvals had been made and before closing.\n\nThe upshot of this feature was to allow Kunelius to receive any tax\n\ncredit for the transfer or encumbrance.1                      Finally, the liquidated\n\n\n     1\n      The record reflects that Kunelius intended to donate the 42.1\nacres of forest land to the Town. We need not speculate about her\nreasons for structuring her affairs in the way that she did, rather\nthan attempting to sell only the 8.57 acres in a transaction\nseparate from the contemplated land donation. See Mass. Gen. Laws\nch. 61 § 8 (2001) (providing that only land taxed under Chapter 61\nis subject to the right of first refusal); see also Town of Sudbury\n\n                                              -6-\n\fdamages provision in Cohousing's revised offer remained the same as\n\nin the prior offer.\n\n             Although   Kunelius   did    not   accept   the   second   offer,\n\nnegotiations continued, and the parties eventually reached an\n\nagreement.      The terms of the contract, which was drafted by\n\nKunelius's attorney, diverged in several ways from previous offers.\n\nThe slightly increased purchase price was to be paid in the same\n\nfashion as before, with Kunelius holding a note for a portion of\n\nthe price.    The time for performance was set at September 26, 2003,\n\nalthough Cohousing had the opportunity to extend this period for a\n\nyear if \"the Chap. 40B approval process is proceeding forward.\"\n\n             Among other changes were the inclusion of at least two\n\nreferences to the possibility of the Town exercising its ROFR. One\n\nprovision stated flatly that \"[i]n the event that the Town of Stow\n\nexercises its right of first refusal pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nch. 61, all monies deposited hereunder shall be forthwith returned\n\nto BUYER without further recourse by either party in equity or\n\nlaw.\"   Another change involved a clarification of Kunelius's right\n\nto transfer that portion of her land classified as forest land:\n\nafter the 40B development was approved and the seller received all\n\n\n\nv. Scott, 787 N.E.2d 536, 542 & n.11 (Mass. 2003) (clarifying that\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 61A § 17 should be interpreted to allow \"the\nmunicipality to exercise its first refusal rights as to the portion\nof the land that is to be separated from the remainder, when sold\nor converted, as set forth in [Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 61A § 14], while\nthe remainder of the land may remain in c. 61A\"(emphasis added)).\n\n                                    -7-\n\f\"purchase monies,\" the seller would transfer \"all right, title, and\n\ninterest in the said 42.1 acre parcel currently under [sic.] Mass.\n\nGen. Laws ch. 61, as a charitable contribution.\"\n\n          For purposes of this action, however, the most important\n\nchange between the prior offers and the signed contract was the\n\nclause specifying the remedies available to the seller in the event\n\nof the buyer's breach.    The revised clause reads:\n\n          If BUYER shall fail to fulfill the BUYER'S\n          agreements herein, all deposits made hereunder\n          by the BUYER shall be retained by the SELLER\n          as   liquidated   damages   and   this   shall\n          constitute SELLER'S sole remedy in equity and\n          law.\n\n\nBoth Kunelius and Cohousing signed this agreement sometime in\n\nOctober of 2002.\n\n              B.    The Town Assigns Its ROFR to TPL\n\n          Within days of signing her agreement with Cohousing,\n\nKunelius provided notice to the Town, and other parties required to\n\nbe notified by statute, of her intent to sell all of her 50.67\n\nacres.   Spearheaded by a group known as the Friends of Red Acre\n\n(\"FORA\"), which included many of Kunelius's immediate neighbors on\n\nRed Acre Road, opposition to the proposed co-housing development\n\nsprouted quickly.   This opposition eventually focused on alleged\n\nexcess costs the Town would have to bear as the result of the co-\n\nhousing development.     Urging that the Town exercise its ROFR was\n\none of the principal arrows in the opposition's quiver.\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f          By December 2002, FORA proposed an alternative to the\n\nCohousing's proposed development.      The FORA plan provided that the\n\nTown would contribute $100,000 from Community Preservation Act\n\nfunds and $300,000 from general town funds, as well as assign its\n\nROFR to a non-profit conservation group. Additional funds would be\n\nraised by selling both homes on the property as affordable housing,\n\nand selling the horse farm operations to Eye of the Storm, a non-\n\nprofit   equine   rescue   organization.      (These   proposed   sales\n\ncontemplated relief from various zoning regulations).       All of the\n\nremaining purchase price funding was to come through private\n\ndonations.\n\n          The Trust for Public Land was identified as the non-\n\nprofit conservation organization most likely to accept assignment\n\nof the Town's ROFR.   TPL expressed a strong interest in accepting\n\nthe assignment, but only if certain conditions were met.          Those\n\nconditions included the Town's appropriating $400,000 to support\n\nthe project, FORA and others raising the $22,000 in required\n\ndeposits under Kunelius's contract with Cohousing, TPL determining\n\nthat the project was feasible, and its governing board approving\n\nthe assignment.   On January 13, 2003, the Town decided to borrow\n\nand appropriate $305,000 from its general funds to support the\n\nTown's exercise of the ROFR.     (The remaining $95,000 was to come\n\nfrom Community Preservation Act funds).         But because the Town\n\nwished to exempt the borrowing from the limitations of Proposition\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f2 ½, see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 59 § 21C, the vote was tentative,\n\npending confirmation in a Special Town Election.            By a vote of 515\n\nto 355, however, Stow voters declined to approve the project.\n\n             Undaunted, FORA and the Trust pushed ahead and convinced\n\nthe Town to extend consideration of the ROFR to the full 120-day\n\nperiod     specified   in   the    statute.     During   that   time,    Craig\n\nMcDonnell, the TPL project manager for this transaction, prepared\n\na lengthy \"Project Fact Sheet\" to brief TPL's governing board on\n\nthe project and assist the board in arriving at a decision about\n\nhow   to   proceed.    In   this    document,   McDonnell    explained   that\n\nKunelius was planning to deed most of forest acres to the Town free\n\nof charge, but that TPL's involvement in the project would result\n\nin the conservation of three additional acres and provide the Town\n\naccess to a pond on the 8.57 acres that Cohousing was planning to\n\ndevelop for fire suppression purposes.\n\n             As to the financing and risks of the proposal, McDonnell\n\nnoted that with the failure of the appropriation, TPL would have to\n\naccept the assignment before the Town could replace the defeated\n\n$300,000 appropriation with additional Community Preservation Act\n\nfunds, but that this risk was mitigated by the fact that he\n\nbelieved that TPL's exposure was limited to liquidated damages in\n\nthe amount of $22,000, as provided in the contract between Kunelius\n\nand Cohousing. (Concomitantly, with this candid private assessment\n\nof TPL's obligations and exposure with respect to this transaction,\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fMcDonnell publicly made disparaging statements about developers and\n\ntouted TPL's commitment to complete the transaction and make\n\nKunelius \"whole.\") McDonnell further noted that Kunelius was upset\n\nat the prospect of the Town assigning its ROFR to the Trust.            He\n\nsuggested, however, that the litigation risk was \"minimal\" due to\n\nthe clarity of the liquidated damages clause, and he predicted that\n\nthe Trust would prevail on summary judgment after minimal discovery\n\nin any suit brought by Kunelius. Eventually, TPL's governing board\n\napproved   the   acceptance   of    the   assignment,   but   the     board\n\nnonetheless withheld authority for TPL to close on the transaction.\n\n           Armed with this limited authority, McDonnell went ahead\n\nwith efforts to acquire an assignment of the ROFR.                  Without\n\ndisclosing to the Town the constraints placed on TPL, McDonnell\n\nnegotiated with the Town's Board of Selectmen regarding the terms\n\nunder which TPL would accept the assignment.        By and large, the\n\nnegotiations did not reflect significant disagreement between the\n\nTown and TPL, although TPL refused to indemnify the Town for\n\npotential damages or defense costs in the event of potential\n\nlitigation. TPL did acknowledge that \"the decided cases under\n\nChapter 61 do not explicitly resolve all of the potential issues\n\nthat arise when a municipality assigns its right of first refusal\n\nto a nonprofit conservation organization, including which terms of\n\nthe underlying contract should obligate the assignee.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\f            At a Board of Selectmen meeting on February 11, 2003,2\n\ndays before the Town's ROFR was scheduled to lapse, the Town\n\nassigned the ROFR to the Trust on the terms described above.             At\n\nthe meeting, McDonnell gave a presentation describing the benefits\n\nof the transaction and urged approval of the assignment, but\n\nMcDonnell   did    not   disclose   the    conditions   that   the   Trust's\n\ngoverning board placed on its acceptance of the assignment.            By a\n\nvote of three to one, the Town's Board of Selectmen voted to assign\n\nthe ROFR to the Trust, which the Trust accepted in writing the next\n\nday. In due course, Kunelius was provided with written notice that\n\nthe Town had assigned the ROFR to the Trust, which provided notice\n\nof its acceptance.\n\n                         C.   The Transaction Sours\n\n            About a month later, by March 19, 2003, McDonnell was\n\nsinging a different tune.           On that date, McDonnell wrote in\n\nconfidence to members of FORA, \"I recently have spent some time\n\nthinking through this project in detail . . . and have a realized\n\nthat a number of key assumptions about structure and timing are\n\nunworkable.\"      In an attached confidential memorandum, McDonnell\n\nexplained that the TPL would require $1.154 million at closing and\n\n\n\n     2\n      The day before, on February 10, 2009, The Stow Community\nPreservation Committee, the body that administers Community\nPreservation Act Funds, heard a joint FORA/TPL plea to use funds to\nsupport the Trust's planned exercise of the ROFR. The Committee\nvoted to recommend that the Town approve the necessary expenditures\nat the Town's annual meeting in May 2009.\n\n                                    -12-\n\fproposed relying on Eye of the Storm, a fledgling non-profit with\n\nlittle infrastructure, to raise $400,000 either through fundraising\n\nor a loan secured by its interest in 144 Red Acre Road before\n\nclosing.     In addition, McDonnell contemplated raising $450,000\n\nthrough private philanthropy prior to closing.\n\n           FORA agreed with these observations but concluded that\n\nMcDonnell's proposed fund raising timetable was overly optimistic\n\nand urged the Trust to close with borrowed funds.     To that end,\n\nFORA arranged for a line of credit for the Trust.\n\n           McDonnell replied with another confidential memorandum\n\ndated March 27, after the assignment but before the Town provided\n\nany funds.     In this memorandum, for the first time, McDonnell\n\ndisclosed to FORA that \"TPL's national board has given only a\n\ntentative approval to this excellent adventure we are undertaking\n\ntogether. . . . We have not received the go-ahead to actually\n\npurchase the property.   Our board is awaiting progress on both the\n\npolitical and fundraising fronts. Unless we secure approval at the\n\nMay town meeting and make substantial progress on the remaining\n\nfinances, I do not believe we will get national approval for this\n\nproject.\"3 Although McDonnell did not foreclose the possibility of\n\nTPL's obtaining \"conservation financing,\" he made clear that it\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      There is no indication in the record that these limitations\non TPL's authority were disclosed to Kunelius or the Town at this\ntime.\n\n                               -13-\n\fwould have to be limited to $600,000, the combined value of the\n\nmain house and the horse farm/caretaker's house.4\n\n           Despite these doubts with respect to the financing of the\n\nproject, the Trust, FORA, and the Town pressed onward.           The Trust\n\nand the Town applied for state aid to rehabilitate the two homes on\n\nthe Kunelius property, and prepared for the Town meeting, which was\n\nto confirm the Town's contribution of Community Preservation Act\n\nfunds.   At the meeting, the funds were approved, but this approval\n\nmarked the high-water mark of the potential transaction.\n\n           Soon thereafter, in mid-June 2003, although contrary\n\nindications were evident even before the Trust accepted the ROFR,\n\nit became clearer that the Trust's plan of dividing the parcel in\n\norder to sell the two homes on the Kunelius property was unlikely\n\nto fare well in the zoning process.             In another blow to the\n\nproject, in early July 2003, the State Department of Housing and\n\nCommunity Development denied the grant application to renovate the\n\ntwo houses on the property.        The combination of these body blows\n\nforced   the   Trust   to   ramp    up    planning   for   abandoning   the\n\ntransaction, and to that end, McDonnell wrote to TPL colleagues \"I\n\nthink the most important thing about the 'exit strategy' is not to\n\n\n\n     4\n      In April 2003, McDonnell represented to the Massachusetts\nDepartment of Housing and Community Development that TPL had access\nto a six million dollar line of credit from a bank and would\nconsider using this resource, even though internal TPL discussions\nsuggested that TPL's governing board was unlikely to approve the\nuse of financing in this project.\n\n                                   -14-\n\fbe seen as TPL pulling the plug, but for a consensus to emerge from\n\nall that the project has now got some fatal flaws . . . .\"\n\n               The prediction of fatal flaws proved prescient, though\n\nsome of them were of TPL's own making.              Peter Christiansen, a\n\nleader of FORA, wrote that McDonnell's conduct led him to \"feel\n\nraped,\" and that McDonnell had told him that TPL would neither\n\nengage in any fundraising nor supply any fundraising prospects.\n\nChristiansen further claimed that the Trust solicited leads that\n\nFORA members had identified for funding of other projects.                This\n\nalleged poaching, combined with TPL's threats to pull out of the\n\npurchase altogether, made it difficult for FORA members to harness\n\ntheir relationships with potential donors. Once it appeared likely\n\nthat TPL would withdraw from the transaction, that appearance would\n\nbode ill for FORA-members' relationships with repeat players in the\n\nconservation world.\n\n               By July 31, 2003, the Trust informed FORA that it was\n\n\"not particularly sanguine\" that the transaction could close.\n\nIndeed, TPL unequivocally stated that only price concessions from\n\nKunelius, who was forced to deal with TPL by virtue of the ROFR,\n\ncould save the transaction.5          TPL then requested $350,000 in price\n\nconcessions from Kunelius, which she refused.                 Although TPL and\n\nFORA       continued   to   trade   arguments   about   the    feasibility   of\n\n\n       5\n      At this time, TPL received discouraging news on the zoning\nfront: outside counsel advised TPL that approval of the variances\nwas extremely unlikely.\n\n                                       -15-\n\ffinancing, the project was effectively dead.         TPL unilaterally\n\nwithdrew its application for a zoning variance on September 25,\n\n2003, and did not close on September 26, 2003.\n\n                      D.    Proceedings Below\n\n          Although further discussions occurred between TPL and\n\nKunelius (sometimes with the facilitation of Town officials),\n\nresolution proved elusive. Kunelius filed the present suit against\n\nthe Town, the Trust, an alleged partnership between the Town and\n\nTrust,    and   McDonnell        in      his   individual   capacity.6\n\nAfter preliminary skirmishing, including the dismissal of one count\n\nnot at issue here, and after the conclusion of discovery, the\n\ndistrict court granted summary judgment to all defendants.7      This\n\nappeal timely followed.\n\n                           II.

Pomales\nv. Celulares Telefonica, Inc., 447 F.3d 79, 85 n.4 (1st Cir. 2006)\n     7\n      We note that during the pendency of discovery, all defendants\njointly filed a motion to certify a central question of this suit\nto the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. The defendants argued\nthat \"there is no controlling precedent in the decisions of the SJC\nor the Massachusetts Appeals Court\" regarding whether a liquidated\ndamages clause negotiated between the owner of Chapter 61 lands and\na willing buyer should, by operation of law, become a provision\nthat is applicable to a municipality or non-profit conservation\norganization exercising an ROFR.       This motion was eventually\nwithdrawn, subject to renewal.\n\n                                  -16-\n\fdilute this standard.         Desrosiers v. Hartford Life and Accident\n\nIns.

After that, we will address the Chapter 93A\n\nclaim, the claim based on the covenant of good faith and fair\n\ndealing.   Finally, we will briefly discuss Kunelius's remaining\n\nclaims.\n\n A.   Applicability of the Liquidated Damages Clause to the Town\n                             and Trust\n\n\n           We begin with the question of whether the liquidated\n\ndamages clause in Kunelius's contract with Cohousing is a term that\n\ninures to the benefit of the Trust and the Town.      The district\n\ncourt noted that all parties agree that TPL breached the purchase\n\nand sale contract, but they disagree as to the proper remedy.\n\nKunelius sought specific performance or full benefit-of-the-bargain\n\ndamages, while the Trust claimed that Kunelius's remedy for breach\n\nwas limited to the $19,000 in deposits and monthly payments that it\n\nhad already paid and Kunelius has retained.\n\n           The district court observed, as the parties had, that it\n\nis unclear whether Massachusetts courts would find that an exercise\n\nof an ROFR requires the purchaser to \"literally meet every last\n\ndetail of the prior offer or only the essential terms, such as, for\n\ninstance, the identity of the subject property, the price, the time\n\nfor performance and the like, but not subsidiary agreements, such\n\n\n                               -18-\n\fas, for instance, mortgage contingencies, rights to inspect . . .\n\nor pertinent to this controversy, provisions regarding remedies for\n\nbreach.\"      Kunelius v. Town of Stow, No. 05-11697-GAO, 2008 WL\n\n4372752 at *2 (D. Mass. Sept. 23, 2008) (footnote omitted).                The\n\ndistrict court determined that it did not need to answer this\n\nquestion because the parties agreed that the purchase and sale\n\nagreement \"set[] forth the terms of their contract.\"              As evidence\n\nof this agreement on the part of plaintiff, the district court\n\ncited paragraph 58 of her complaint which states, \"The P & S is a\n\nvalid and enforceable contract between Kunelius and Stow and TPL.\"\n\nId.\n\n             Unlike the district court, we are not persuaded that\n\nKunelius has admitted that the liquidated damages provision applied\n\nto    the   Town   and   the   Trust.     Paragraph   55   of   her   complaint\n\nspecifically states that \"The obligations of Stow and TPL under\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 61 could not be avoided by relying on the\n\nliquidated damage[s] clause . . . since such liquidated damage[s]\n\nclause . . . was applicable only to Cohousing since it sought\n\ncertain permits and approvals in connection with its [Chapter] 40B\n\n. . . Development.\"       (emphasis added).    In light of this paragraph,\n\nwe think that the complaint is best read as asserting that the Town\n\nand the Trust's joint exercise of the ROFR, by operation of law,\n\nobliged them to purchase the property identified in the contract at\n\nthe price stated.\n\n\n                                        -19-\n\f              The district court is, of course, correct that the Trust\n\nhas consistently taken the position that it assumed the role of\n\nCohousing in the contract and that the liquidated damages provision\n\ninured to its benefit. The plaintiff, however, claims that through\n\nher then-counsel, she communicated to the Town attorney her belief\n\nthat the liquidated damages clause did not apply to the Town and\n\nthe Trust.      Moreover, the record also reveals that the Trust, in a\n\ncommunication to the Town, acknowledged that the question of which\n\nprovisions of the P & S apply to the exercisor or assignee of an\n\nROFR under Chapter 61 remains an open question.                          Ultimately,\n\ntherefore, we are satisfied that the plaintiff adequately preserved\n\nthis question below, and has properly raised it on appeal.\n\n              Ordinarily, in Massachusetts \"contract interpretation is\n\nfor the court, unless disputed issues of fact bear upon the\n\ninterpretation of ambiguous language.\"               Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v.\n\nGreenwich Ins. Co., 417 F.3d 193, 197 (1st Cir. 2005) (citing\n\nFishman v. LaSalle Nat'l Bank, 247 F.3d 300, 303 (1st Cir. 2001)).\n\nWe have explained that \"judges construe contracts, if only the\n\nwords    need    be    considered,      and   the   jury   does    the    job   under\n\ninstructions if evidentiary issues have to be resolved.\"                   Fishman,\n\n237   F.3d      at    303   (citations    omitted).        Here,   there     are   no\n\nevidentiary questions to resolve; rather, we must decide, as a\n\nmatter   of     law,    whether   the    liquidated    damages     provision,      by\n\noperation of law, was made applicable to the Town and the Trust.\n\n\n                                         -20-\n\f                For the reasons that follow, we believe that the Supreme\n\nJudicial Court (\"SJC\") would hold that the liquidated damages\n\nprovision       inures         to   the    benefit       of    the   Trust   and    the   Town.\n\nAlthough there is scant case law interpreting Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\n\n61    §    8,   we       may   look   to        case    law   decided    under     the    nearly\n\nidentically-worded ROFR provision of agricultural and horticultural\n\nlands, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 61A § 14.                            See Comm. v. Smith, 728\n\nN.E.2d 272, 276 (Mass. 2000) (noting that it is most appropriate to\n\nuse construction of one statute to inform construction of another\n\nwhen the two statutes relate to the same class of things or share\n\na similar purpose) (citation omitted).\n\n                At the time that Kunelius entered into the transaction\n\nwith Cohousing, the SJC had not decided any cases under either\n\nstatute, but that court has since decided at least two cases under\n\nch. 61A § 14.             In Town of Sudbury v. Scott, a divided SJC, after\n\nreviewing the various features of Chapter 61A, including the\n\nconveyance tax, the roll-back tax, and the ROFR, held that in order\n\nfor parties to the sale of lands certified under Chapter 61A to\n\navoid a municipality's ROFR, the putative purchaser must not have\n\nthe       intent     to    convert        the    land    to    non-agricultural      or       non-\n\nhorticultural purposes at the time of purchase. 787 N.E.2d at 544.\n\nThe court therefore vacated summary judgment in favor of the\n\npurchaser          and    remanded        the    case    for    a    determination       of   the\n\npurchaser's intent at the time of the purchase.                          Id. at 546-47.         In\n\n\n                                                  -21-\n\fTown of Franklin v. Wyllie, a unanimous SJC held that a developer's\n\noffer to purchase undeveloped land subject to Chapter 61A was bona\n\nfide, even though the final purchase price was contingent on the\n\nnumber of lots ultimately approved for development.     819 N.E.2d\n\n943, 948 (Mass. 2005).   The court went on to conclude that since\n\nthe offer was bona fide, had the Town of Franklin chosen to\n\nexercise its ROFR it would have been obliged to determine how many\n\nlots would be approved for development to fix the purchase price,\n\nin order to purchase the property \"on substantially the same terms\n\nand conditions\" as those struck between the non-municipal buyer and\n\nthe seller.   Id. at 950 (citing Stone v. W.E. Aubuchon Co., 562\n\nN.E.2d 852 (Mass. App. Ct. 1990)).8\n\n\n\n\n     8\n      The Massachusetts legislature has since abrogated the rule in\nWyllie, and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 61A § 14 and C. 61 §8 now require\nthat in order to be \"bona fide,\" an offer must not be \"dependent on\npotential changes to current zoning or conditions or contingencies\nrelating to the potential for or the potential extent of\nsubdivision of the property for residential use or the potential\nfor, or the potential extent of development of the property for\nindustrial or commercial use, made by a party unaffiliated with the\nlandowner for fixed consideration payable upon delivery of the\ndeed.\" St. 2006 C. 394 §§ 18, 31.\n     We apply the law as it was before the legislature amended it,\neffective March 22, 2007.     See Fleet Nat'l    Bank v. Comm'r of\nRevenue, 852 N.E.2d 22, 28-29 (Mass. 2007) (noting that retroactive\napplication of statutes adjusting substantive rights, as opposed to\nremedies, is disfavored and thus the court employs a presumption\nagainst retroactive application that it uses to resolve uncertain\ncases)(citing Austin v. Boston Univ. Hosp., 363 N.E.2d 515 (Mass.\n1977)); see also City of Newburyport v. Woodman, No. 309692, 2007\nWL 3256964, at *3-4 (Mass. Land Ct. 2007) (noting that General\nCourt enacted C. 394 to overturn the decision in Wyllie, but that\nthis enactment was not to be applied retroactively).\n\n                               -22-\n\f           Thus, neither Scott nor Wyllie addresses the precise\n\nquestion at issue here.        Nevertheless, the appellees make much of\n\nthe fact that in both decisions the SJC suggested more broadly that\n\nthe statutory ROFR conferred on a municipality under C. 61A § 14\n\nand C. 61 § 8 \"ripen[s] into an option to purchase according to the\n\nterms of the offer.\"     Wyllie, 819 N.E.2d at 949 (citing Greenfield\n\nCountry Estates Tenants Ass'n v. Deep, 666 N.E.2d 988, 993 n.14\n\n(Mass. 1989)); see also Wyllie, 819 N.E.2d at 949 (\"There is no\n\nindication,   however,    that     the       Legislature   intended   that    a\n\nmunicipality's 'first refusal option' to purchase would encompass\n\nthe right to purchase such land on different terms and conditions\n\nthan [those] set forth in the 'bona fide offer.'\" (emphasis added)\n\n(citing Scott, 787 N.E.2d at 544 n. 14))).           From this language, the\n\nappellees argue that they should be obliged to take on no more risk\n\nor offer no more certainty that their transaction would close than\n\nCohousing offered in its bona fide offer.\n\n           The plaintiff's position is that she was able to offer a\n\nstreamlined liquidated damages clause to Cohousing because she had\n\nestablished a considerable amount of mutual trust and understanding\n\nwith ScottHansen, and because she felt comfortable that Cohousing's\n\ndevelopment was properly financed and Chapter 40B approvals would\n\nbe forthcoming.     Consequently, the argument goes, it would be\n\ngrossly   unfair   to   give    the   Town     and   the   Trust   these   same\n\nconcessions, particularly in light of the fact that the Trust's\n\n\n                                      -23-\n\fability to close was tenuous from the beginning and its statements\n\nto the contrary were disingenuous.    Embedded in this argument is\n\nthe policy concern that granting municipalities and nonprofits\n\nadded leverage to disrupt transactions involving certified land\n\nwould tilt the statutory structure too far toward the municipality\n\nand would therefore reduce the number of landowners willing to\n\nparticipate in the scheme.\n\n          These arguments are not without some appeal, although the\n\nmost obvious response is that Kunelius understood herself to be\n\nbargaining in the shadow of the Town's ROFR.    She therefore also\n\nshould have understood the desirability of accounting for the fact\n\nthat any deal she struck would be available to the Town, or to any\n\nnon-profit conservation organization to which the Town might choose\n\nto assign the lease.    She may well have been able to negotiate\n\nterms that would have better protected her in the event that less\n\nreliable counterparties, such as the Town and the Trust, would\n\nbecome parties to this transaction.     Whether or not such terms\n\nultimately would have protected her, we must decide the case on the\n\nfacts as they are.   Despite her knowledge that the ROFR lurked in\n\nthe weeds, Kunelius in fact did not include any language in the\n\ncontract to limit her risk in the event of the exercise of the\n\nknown ROFR.\n\n          In addition to Kunelius's control over the drafting of\n\nher contract, the cases at common law (which applies to statutory\n\n\n                               -24-\n\fROFRs, see Scott, 787 N.E.2d at 543 n.12), cut against her legal\n\nposition.    Most common law courts do not appear to have focused\n\ncarefully    on   this    question,    and    thus   have   not    addressed    the\n\nspecific concerns that the appellant identifies, but most have\n\ngenerally stated that once a seller receives a bona fide offer, the\n\nROFR ripens into an option to purchase the property \"at the price\n\nand otherwise on the terms stated in the offer.\"                  T.W. Nickerson,\n\nInc. v. Fleet Nat. Bank, 898 N.E.2d 868, 878 (Mass. App. Ct. 2009)\n\n(quoting Frostar Corp. v. Malloy, 823 N.E.2d 417 (Mass. App. Ct.\n\n2005) (emphasis added)); see also Gleason v. Norwest Mortgage,\n\nInc., 243 F.3d 130, 139 n. 5 (3d Cir. 2001) (applying Minnesota\n\nlaw) (citing Allison v. Agribank FCB, 949 S.W.2d 182, 186 (Mo. Ct.\n\nApp. 1997)); Henry Simons Lumber Co v. Simons, 44 N.W.2d 726, 727\n\n(Minn. 1950).       As a result, the holder of an ROFR must have\n\nknowledge of the terms and conditions of the entire offer so that\n\nthe holder may decide if she wishes to meet the offer.                         T.W.\n\nNickerson, 898 N.E.2d at 878 (citing Gyurkey v. Babler, 651 P.2d\n\n928 (Idaho 1982)); see also Uno Rest., Inc. v. Boston Kenmore\n\nRealty Corp., 805 N.E.2d 957, 962-63 (Mass. 2004); Miller v. LeSea\n\nBroadcasting,     Inc.,    87   F.3d    224,    (7th   Cir.   1996)     (applying\n\nWisconsin law) (noting that requirement that holder of ROFR exactly\n\nmatch a bona fide offer is in fact a protection for the grantor of\n\nthe ROFR).    Requiring that the holder of an ROFR have access to\n\n\n\n\n                                       -25-\n\fsuch terms would serve little purpose if the holder of the ROFR\n\nwere not required to meet them.\n\n               Thus, the decisions interpreting the statutory ROFR at\n\nissue in this case (or more precisely, its twin), as well as\n\ndecisions dealing with common law rights of first refusal more\n\ngenerally, all suggest that the holder of an ROFR must meet all of\n\nthe terms and conditions of the offer, including subsidiary terms\n\nsuch as the liquidated damages clause at issue here.                Many courts\n\ndo, however, make an exception for immaterial terms with which the\n\nholder of an ROFR need not comply,9 e.g., W. Tex. Transmission,\n\nL.P. v. Enron Corp., 907 F.2d 1554, 1556 (5th Cir. 1990); John D.\n\nStump & Assocs., Inc. v. Cunningham Mem'l Park Inc., 419 S.E.2d\n\n699, 705 (W. Va. 1992); Brownies Creek Collieries, Inc. v. Asher\n\nCoal Mining Co., 417 S.W.2d 249, 252 (Ky. 1967), and even those\n\nthat do not make a materiality exception generally make three\n\nexceptions to the rule of exact matching.               First, the grantor can\n\nwaive exact matching by agreeing that certain terms should not\n\napply to the holder of an ROFR.              Miller, 87 F.3d at 227; see also\n\nState Dept. of Transp. v. Providence and Worcester R.R. Co., 674\n\nA.2d       1239,   1243-44   (R.I.   1996)    (state,   acting   pursuant   to   a\n\nstatutory ROFR, did not void the ROFR by pointing out that seller\n\n\n\n       9\n      Alternatively, these courts permit the exercise of an ROFR\neven if there are insubstantial variations between the bona fide\noffer and the holder of the ROFR's offer, which is essentially the\nsame thing. See Miller, 87 F.3d at 226.\n\n                                       -26-\n\fwas not required to undertake onerous action that would have been\n\nrequired had the bona fide offer been accepted).        Second, it is of\n\ncourse clear that the names of the parties will not exactly match\n\nthe proper names contained in the bona fide offer when the holder\n\nof an ROFR exercises it.     Miller, 87 F.3d at 227; Providence and\n\nWorcester R.R. Co., 674 A.2d at 1243-44 (noting that name of buyer\n\nshould be changed to \"the state\").       Finally, courts will relax the\n\nrule of perfect matching in the presence of bad faith.         Wyllie, 819\n\nN.E.2d at 949 n. 8; Miller, 87 F.3d at 228 (citing Or. RSA No.6,\n\nInc. v. Castle Rock Cellular of Or., L.P., 76 F.3d 1003, 1007 (9th\n\nCir. 1996)).   Aside from these exceptions, however, most courts\n\nhold that the terms of the bona fide offer become binding on the\n\nholder of an ROFR.   This authority persuades us that the SJC likely\n\nwould adopt a similar rule.\n\n           In an argument faintly reminiscent of the third exception\n\nnoted above, the appellant asserts that the Trust acted in bad\n\nfaith such that the Trust should not be entitled to rely on the\n\nliquidated damages provision.        As examples of that bad faith, the\n\nappellant points to the Trust's unwillingness to allow her to make\n\na charitable donation of the 42.1 acres, its refusal to proceed\n\nunder Chapter 40B, and its attempt to lower the purchase price.\n\nWhile declining to proceed with a Chapter 40B application was\n\nentirely   proper,   the   Trust's    other   actions   may   suggest   the\n\npossibility of a violation of Chapter 93A, a breach of the implied\n\n\n                                 -27-\n\fcovenant    of    good   faith   and     fair   dealing,    or   the    Trust's\n\nanticipatory breach of its contract with the appellant (the first\n\ntwo of which we address later, and the last being a cause of action\n\nthat has not found much hospitality under Massachusetts law, see\n\ngenerally Daniels v. Newton, 114 Mass. 530 (1874)).                We fail to\n\nsee, however, in what way these action support an argument for\n\nvarying the terms under which the Trust could accept the contract.\n\nAccordingly, this argument does not disturb our conclusion that the\n\nliquidated damages provision applies to the Trust and the Town.\n\n           B.    Validity of the Liquidated Damages Provision\n\n            Having determined that the liquidated damages provision\n\nof   Kunelius's     contract   with    Cohousing   formed    a   part    of   her\n\nrelationship with the Town and the Trust, we turn to her argument\n\nthat the provision is nevertheless invalid.                In Massachusetts,\n\nwhether a liquidated damages clause is valid and enforceable is a\n\nquestion of law, and therefore we review the issue de novo.                   NPS\n\nLLC v. Minihane, 886 N.E.2d 670, 673 & n.5 (Mass. 2008).                Although\n\nit was once unsettled, it is now clear that in Massachusetts, the\n\nparty resisting the enforcement of the liquidated damages provision\n\nbears the burden of persuasion.         Id. (citing TAL Fin. Corp. v. CSC\n\nConsulting, Inc., 844 N.E.2d 1085, 1092 (Mass. 2006)); see also\n\nHoney Dew Assocs., Inc. v. M&K Food Corp., 241 F.3d 23, 27 (1st\n\nCir. 2001).\n\n\n\n\n                                       -28-\n\f            Massachusetts courts have long accepted contracts with\n\nliquidated damages provisions, particularly those involved in the\n\npurchase and sale of real estate.        Kelly v. Marx, 705 N.E.2d 1114,\n\n1116 (Mass. 1999).       Generally, a contract containing a provision\n\nawarding liquidated damages to the seller of real property in the\n\nevent of a buyer's breach will be enforced so long as \"at the time\n\nthe   agreement    was   made,   potential     damages   were   difficult   to\n\ndetermine and the [liquidated damages provision] was a reasonable\n\nforecast of damages expected to occur.\"            Perroncello v. Donahue,\n\n859 N.E.2d 827, 831 (Mass. 2007) (quoting Kelly, 705 N.E.2d at\n\n1115).     Under this rubric, Massachusetts courts have specifically\n\neschewed the \"second look\" approach and evaluate both of these\n\nfactors only at the time of contract formation.            Kelly, 705 N.E.2d\n\nat 1116.     Nevertheless, liquidated damages clauses will not be\n\nenforced     if   they   provide   for   an    amount    that   is   \"'grossly\n\ndisproportionate to a reasonable estimate of actual damages' made\n\nat the time of contract formation.\"           Id. (quoting Lynch v. Andrew,\n\n481 N.E.2d 1383, 1386 (Mass. App. Ct. 1985).\n\n            Interestingly, most cases challenging liquidated damages\n\nprovisions do so on the theory that overly large liquidated damage\n\nawards impermissibly function as a penalty.10            See, e.g., NPS LLC,\n\n\n      10\n      There are good reasons to wonder whether worrying about\nwhether liquidated damages take on a penal aspect is wise as a\nmatter of contract law or economic policy. See generally, Charles\nJ. Goetz and Robert E. Scott, Liquidated Damages, Penalties, and\nthe Just Compensation Principle, 77 Colum. L. Rev. 554, 556 (1977)\n\n                                    -29-\n\f886 N.E.2d at 673.   In this case, the appellant complains that the\n\nliquidated damages provision was inadequate because it vastly\n\nunderestimated her damages and therefore functions as a penalty\n\nagainst her.11\n\n          This theory is relatively novel, and the weight of\n\nauthority is against it.   E.g., Margaret H. Wayne Trust v. Lipsky,\n\n846 P.2d 904, 910 (Idaho 1993); Mahoney v. Tingley, 529 P.2d 1068,\n\n1070-71 (Wash. 1975) (\"Except where extraordinary circumstances are\n\ninvolved such as fraud or serious overreaching by the purchaser, a\n\nseller who chooses to utilize the device of liquidated damages in\n\nan earnest money agreement . . . cannot avoid the effect of that\n\nagreement.\"); see also Nasco Inc. v. Pub. Storage, Inc., No. 92-CV-\n\n12731-RCL, 1995 WL 337072 (D. Mass. May 20, 1995).   Nevertheless,\n\nit appears that in Kelly, and the cases decided thereafter, the SJC\n\nhas left open the possibility that a liquidated damages clause will\n\nbe set aside if it grossly overestimated or underestimated a\n\n\n(arguing that uncritical application of the penalty doctrine\n\"frequently induces a costly reexamination of the initial\nallocation of risks and may also deny the non-breaching party\neither adequate compensation for the harm caused by the breach or\nthe opportunity to insure more optimally against such harm\").\n     11\n      In this regard, we note that the record suggests that the\ncurrent, less favorable liquidated damages provision was not\nincluded among Cohousing's original offers but was made a part of\nthe agreement that Kunelius's attorney ultimately drafted. While\nthis fact is not dispositive of her claim, it is clear that the\nappellant was not stuck with this clause as the result of an\nadhesion contract, and the record further suggests that the\nappellant did not arrive at this particular clause due to a\nsubstantial inequality in bargaining power.\n\n                                -30-\n\fparty's damages at the time of contract formation.              See Kelly, 705\n\nN.E.2d at 1116 (liquidated damages provision will not be enforced\n\nif   it    provides   for   an   amount   \"grossly    disproportionate    to   a\n\nreasonable damages made at the time of contract formation\"); Howard\n\nv. Wee, 811 N.E.2d 1050, 1052 (Mass. App. Ct. 2004) (noting that\n\n$1,000 in liquidated damages was not \"unreasonably low,\" but not\n\nquestioning that unreasonably low liquidated damages can be set\n\naside under Kelly).\n\n             We   must   therefore    determine      whether   the   liquidated\n\ndamages provision at issue in this case was, as a matter of law,\n\ngrossly disproportionate to a reasonable estimate of the damages\n\nKunelius would incur in the event that the sale of her $1.16\n\nmillion property was not successful.12            Massachusetts courts have\n\nheld that an earnest money deposit of 5% of the purchase price in\n\na contract for the purchase and sale of real estate is reasonable\n\nas a matter law.         Kelly, 705 N.E.2d at 1117; see also NRT New\n\nEngland, Inc. v. Moncure, 24 Mass. L. Rptr. 599, 2008 WL 4739794,\n\nat *5 (Mass. Super. 2008); Old Oxford Realty Partners LLC v. Shea,\n\nNo. 305754, 2005 WL 1323110, at *5 (Mass Land Ct. 2005).               Although\n\nwe have found one reported decision in which a Massachusetts court\n\n\n\n      12\n      In order to uphold the liquidated damages provision, we also\nneed to conclude that Kunelius's damages were difficult to measure\nat the time of contract formation. In light of the Kelly court's\nobservation that such damages are often hard to value in\ntransactions involving the purchase and sale of real estate, this\nis an easy threshold to clear.\n\n                                      -31-\n\fblessed a lower amount of liquidated damages, it was in a factual\n\ncircumstance that differs materially from this case.                   In Howard,\n\nthe court of appeals found that liquidated damages in the amount of\n\n$1000 was not \"unreasonably low\" considering that this amount was\n\nto cover damages incurred over a period of about eleven days.                 811\n\nN.E.2d at 1052.\n\n                  Here, Kunelius was to receive $19,000 in liquidated\n\ndamages.13         This amount is approximately 2% of the total purchase\n\nprice        of    $1.16   million,   obviously    less   than   the    5%   that\n\nMassachusetts courts have upheld.              But Kunelius failed to produce\n\nevidence or argue in the district court that the 2% liquidated\n\ndamages clause was \"grossly disproportionate\" to a reasonable\n\nestimate of her actual damages at the time of contract formation,\n\nand therefore, this argument has been waived.               CoxCom, Inc., 536\n\nF.3d at 110 n.11.          As a result, like the district court we too must\n\n\n\n        13\n      The Town and the Trust had six months to close. Closing had\nto occur on or before September 26, 2003 because the contract term\ngranting an extension of the closing date was contingent on the\n\"Chap. 40B approval process . . . proceeding forward.\" Although it\ncould be argued that the pertinent time of contract formation for\npurposes of evaluating the liquidated damages clause was the time\nKunelius negotiated the bona fide offer, evaluating the propriety\nof the damages clause at the time the Trust exercised its\nassignment is not a \"second look\" in the classic sense, because it\nwas at that point that the Trust accepted the contract, and an\nagreement was formed between Kunelius and the Trust.      See T.W.\nNickerson, Inc., 898 N.E.2d at 878. Rather, a second look occurs\nwhen a court evaluates the propriety of a damages provision at the\ntime of breach. See Kelly, 705 N.E.2d at 1116 (explaining that\nunder a so-called \"second look\" analysis, a court looks to the\nactual damages resulting from the breach) (emphasis added).\n\n                                        -32-\n\fconclude that the liquidated damages provision is enforceable in\n\nthis case.\n\n\n\n\n                        C.    The Chapter 93A Claim\n\n            The appellant also presses a claim under the business-to-\n\nbusiness provisions of the consumer protection statute, Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws ch. 93A, § 11.          It is helpful here to review briefly the\n\nstructure    of   the   Massachusetts      consumer   protection   statute.\n\nSection 2 of this statute prohibits unfair and deceptive acts and\n\npractices, see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A § 2(a), and sections 9 and\n\n11 provide consumers and \"businessmen\" with private causes of\n\naction to enforce this prohibition.        Id. §§ 9, 11; see also Lantner\n\nv. Carson, 373 N.E.2d 973, 975-76 (Mass. 1978).14\n\n            In order for a defendant to be liable under the statute\n\nfor damages from unfair or deceptive practices, the transaction at\n\nissue must have occurred in the conduct of \"any trade or commerce,\"\n\nsee Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A §§ 9, 11, which the statute defines as\n\nincluding \"the advertising, [or] offering for sale . . . of\n\n\n     14\n      We note that appellant's complaint did not specify whether\nshe was proceeding under the consumer or business protection\nprovisions of Chapter 93A. At summary judgment, counsel for the\nappellant specified for the first time that she was proceeding\nunder the business-to-business provisions. We note that had the\nplaintiff proceeded on the consumer prong of Chapter 93A, summary\njudgment for the defendants would have been appropriate because the\nplaintiff did not serve the defendants with a demand letter as\nrequired by that section. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A § 9.\n\n                                    -33-\n\f[selling] any property . . . real, personal, or mixed.\"                   Id.\n\n§(1)(b).    Recognizing the potentially broad ambit of this statute,\n\nthe SJC, relying on the statute's creation of a separate cause of\n\naction for \"businessmen\" who are harmed by unfair and deceptive\n\npractices, has made clear that \"the proscription in [Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws ch. 93A § 2] of 'unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the\n\nconduct of any trade or commerce' must be read to apply to those\n\nacts or practices which are perpetrated in a business context.\"\n\nLantner, 373 N.E.2d at 976.\n\n            In interpreting section 11, Massachusetts courts have\n\nlooked not only at whether defendants were sufficiently involved in\n\ntrade or commerce to be held liable under the statute, but also at\n\nwhether    plaintiffs   were   engaged    in   trade   or   commerce.    This\n\ndistinction    is   important    because       Massachusetts    courts   have\n\nunderstood that the private rights of action found in sections 9\n\nand 11 are mutually exclusive.      Frullo v. Landenberger, 814 N.E.2d\n\n1105, 1112 (Mass. App. Ct. 2004) (citing Divenuti v. Reardon, 637\n\nN.E.2d 234, 239 (Mass. App. Ct. 1994)); see also Milliken & Co. v.\n\nDuro Textiles, LLC, 887 N.E.2d 244, 259 (Mass. 2008) (noting that\n\nch. 93A § 11 is only available after satisfaction of dual threshold\n\ninquiries of whether a transaction was commercial in nature, and\n\nwhether the parties to the transaction were engaged in trade or\n\ncommerce \"such that they were acting in a business context\")\n\n(citing Linkage Corp. v. Trs. of Boston Univ., 679 N.E.2d 191, 206-\n\n\n                                   -34-\n\f07 (Mass. 1997))).        Thus, in order for Kunelius to move past the\n\nthreshold on her Chapter 93A claim, she must show (1) that the sale\n\nof the entire parcel, including her home and a horse farm, was a\n\ncommercial transaction, and (2) that both she and the Trust were\n\nengaged in trade or commerce, such that this transaction occurred\n\nin a business context.\n\n            It is true that the Massachusetts courts have held that\n\nChapter 93A does not \"reach strictly private transactions such as\n\nthe isolated sale of a private home.\"            Begelfer v. Najarian, 409\n\nN.E.2d 167, 175 (Mass. 1980).           In that case, the court noted that\n\nwhether an isolated transaction takes place in a \"business context\"\n\nmust be determined from the circumstances in each case, such as the\n\nfrequency   of   similar    transactions,      the   motivation     behind   the\n\ntransaction, and the role of the participant in the transaction.\n\nId. at 176.      The SJC has made clear, however, that a commercial\n\ntransaction need not \"take place only in the ordinary course of a\n\nperson's business or occupation before its participants may be\n\nsubject to liability.\"       Id.\n\n            Considering these factors, the record can be read to\n\nsupport, at least in the summary judgment posture of this case, an\n\ninference    that   the    sale    of    the   property   was   a   commercial\n\ntransaction.     Whether a party is engaged in trade or commerce is a\n\nquestion of fact, see Feeney v. Dell Inc., 908 N.E.2d 753, 770\n\n(Mass. 2009), and thus our review on summary judgment is de novo,\n\n\n                                        -35-\n\fwith all inferences drawn in favor of the non-movant (here, the\n\nplaintiff).   The record includes testimony from the appellant's\n\nreal estate agent that he met Kunelius as a result of the need to\n\nmove his horses to her farm.      He further testified that as of May\n\n24, 2007, the date of his deposition, his horse remained boarded on\n\nthe appellant's property. The agent testified that Kunelius agreed\n\nto permit Cohousing (and eventually the Trust) to substitute a\n\n$50,000 deposit for a $10,000 deposit plus monthly payments of\n\n$1,500 to replace income she feared she would lose because \"her\n\nboarding tenants would begin to leave\" once they learned that her\n\nhorse farm was for sale.15    This evidence, combined with Kunelius's\n\nown affidavit stating that she rented stalls for horses on her\n\nproperty, harvested firewood, and was the barn manager, could\n\npermit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that Kunelius was not\n\nmerely selling her home, but her business and the principal source\n\nof her livelihood.\n\n          Massachusetts      courts   have   held   that   the   sale   of   a\n\nbusiness or substantially all of the assets of a business can be a\n\ncommercial transaction subject to the proscriptions of Chapter 93A.\n\nRex Lumber Co. v. Acton Block Co., Inc., 562 N.E.2d 845, 850 (Mass.\n\nApp. Ct. 1990).   In Rex Lumber, the defendant, Acton Block Co.,\n\n\n\n     15\n      The agent testified that he paid the appellant about $250 per\nmonth to board his horse at her farm. Thus, the record supports\nthe inference that appellant likely received payment for boarding\nfive horses at her farm at the time she entered the contract.\n\n                                  -36-\n\fproposed   to     sell    the   land   and   building   on   which     its   former\n\nbusiness, which had been discontinued for two years, had once\n\noperated, in order to fund the retirement of the defendant's owner.\n\nId.   at   846.      The    appeals     court     nonetheless   held      that    the\n\ntransaction was a commercial one made in a business context, under\n\nLantner and Begelfer, despite the fact that it was not made in the\n\nordinary course of business.           Rex Lumber, 562 N.E.2d at 850.        Thus,\n\nwhile it is a close question, we believe that at this summary\n\njudgment   stage     it    is   possible     to   conclude   that   the    sale    of\n\nappellant's horse farm and other property, from which she derived\n\nsignificant income, was a commercial transaction. Similarly, there\n\nis enough evidence in the record to support the conclusion that\n\nKunelius was engaged in trade or business with respect to the\n\ntransaction in which she disposed of all of the assets that she\n\nharnessed to produce her income, and fund her retirement, if Rex\n\nLumber is good law.         Therefore, the district court was on shaky\n\nfooting in determining that Kunelius was not engaged in trade or\n\ncommerce generally or with respect to this particular transaction.\n\n            Relying on our authority to affirm the decision of the\n\ndistrict court on any basis made manifest in the record, States\n\nRes. Corp. v. The Architectural Team, Inc., 433 F.3d 73, 80 (1st\n\nCir. 2005) (citing Uncle Henry's, Inc. v. Plaut Consulting Co., 399\n\nF.3d 33, 41 (1st Cir. 2005)), the Trust urges that summary judgment\n\nwas appropriate because the Trust was not engaged in trade or\n\n\n                                        -37-\n\fcommerce, based on its status as a nonprofit corporation.16     We\n\nagree.    In Massachusetts, a defendant's nonprofit status is not\n\ndispositive of whether it can be liable under Chapter 93A. Compare\n\nLinkage Corp. v. Trs. of Boston Univ., 679 N.E.2d 191, 207 n.34\n\n(Mass. 1997) (noting that Massachusetts courts have held nonprofit\n\ncorporations liable under Chapter 93A) (citing Miller v.

Kunelius, 2008 WL 4372752 at *1 n.1, *5. As we, like\nthe district court, conclude that the Trust was entitled to summary\njudgment on this count, we need not decide whether any such\npartnership existed because it too would be entitled to summary\njudgment.\n\n                               -38-\n\fnot engaged in trade or commerce when it sought bids for operation\n\nof vending machines and canteen facility, as this operation was\n\nincidental     to   its   charitable   mission   of   providing   medical\n\nservices).\n\n            Determining whether a nonprofit defendant is beyond the\n\nreach of Chapter 93A is a \"fact-specific . . . inquiry,\" but a\n\nnonprofit defendant will not be considered engaged in trade or\n\ncommerce when it \"undertakes activities in furtherance of its core\n\nmission.\"      Linkage Corp., 679 N.E.2d at 209.      Nevertheless, when\n\n\"an institution's business motivations, in combination with the\n\nnature of the transaction and the activities of the parties,\n\nestablish a 'business context' as contemplated in [Begelfer v.\n\nNajarian, 409 N.E.2d 167 (Mass. 1980)], G.L. c. 93A will apply\n\nbecause the institution has inserted itself into the marketplace in\n\na way that makes it only proper that it be subject to rules of\n\nethical behavior and fair play.\"       Id.\n\n            In view of its conclusion that Kunelius was not engaged\n\nin trade or commerce, the district court did not evaluate whether\n\nthe Trust was so engaged.        In our view, the record viewed in the\n\nlight   most    favorable   to   Kunelius,   nonetheless   requires   the\n\nconclusion that TPL, undisputably a not for profit organization,\n\nwas acting in pursuit of its core nonprofit charitable mission of\n\npreserving and conserving land.           The fact that it planned to\n\npurchase Kunelius's property, renovate both houses, and resell one\n\n\n                                   -39-\n\for possibly both of them on the open market was merely a means to\n\nan end, and not intended to turn a profit -- like a hospital\n\nproviding    limited     commissary    services      --   and   therefore    not\n\nactionable under Chapter 93A.         See All Seasons Servs., Inc., 620\n\nN.E.2d at 780.      In that vein, we note that even in its commercial\n\ntransactions, the Trust planned to promote its core charitable\n\nmission of land conservation by including conservation covenants\n\nthat ran with the parcels it sold on the open market.              Thus, while\n\nit may be true that the record supports an inference that the Trust\n\nacted   sharply     in   its   dealings      with   Kunelius,    the   SJC   has\n\nnonetheless made clear that where a nonprofit defendant is acting\n\nin furtherance of its core mission, Chapter 93A is not designed to\n\nreach such conduct. Accordingly, summary judgment as to this count\n\nwas properly granted to the Trust, the Town, and a partnership\n\nbetween the Town and Trust, if any such partnership existed.\n\n             D.    Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing\n\n            The district court found that the plaintiff did not plead\n\na violation of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing in her\n\ncomplaint, but instead raised it for the first time in connection\n\nwith cross motions for summary judgment. Kunelius, 2008 WL 4372752\n\nat *1 n.2.        The appellant argues that her complaint sets forth\n\nsufficient facts to state a claim for breach of the covenant and\n\nthat the summary judgment record permits the inference that the\n\ncovenant was breached; therefore, she should be permitted to pursue\n\n\n                                      -40-\n\fthis claim.     In support of this argument, Kunelius cites a number\n\nof Massachusetts cases explaining Massachusetts state pleading\n\nstandards,    but   as   we   are   in    federal       court,   federal   pleading\n\nstandards apply.      Jerry Smith and Jeffrey Parness, 2 Moore's Fed.\n\nPractice § 8.04[1][A] at 8-23 (3d ed. 2007); see also In re Tower\n\nAir, Inc., 416 F.3d 229, 236-38 (3d Cir. 2005) (noting that\n\ndistrict court mistakenly applied heightened requirements for state\n\nnotice pleading standard in federal case).\n\n             In federal court, when a plaintiff raises a claim for the\n\nfirst time in response to a summary judgment motion, it is possible\n\nto treat the claim as a motion to amend the complaint under Rule\n\n15(a)   of   the    Federal   Rules      of     Civil    Procedure.        Sover   v.\n\nHattiesburg Pub. Sch. Dist., 549 F.3d 985, 989 n.2 (5th Cir. 2008).\n\nThe plaintiff, however, made no such argument to the district court\n\nand has not advanced one here.           Therefore, we need not linger over\n\nthis question.      See Cook v. Gates, 528 F.3d 42, 62 n.13 (1st Cir.\n\n2008); Nieves-Vega v. Ortiz-Quiñones, 443 F.3d 134, 137 n.1 (1st\n\nCir. 2006) (finding that claim raised for the first time at oral\n\nargument is, at best, forfeit).           In any event, it was not likely an\n\nabuse of discretion -- and certainly not plain error -- for the\n\ndistrict court to deny such a circuitous request for an amendment\n\nafter summary judgment motions had been docketed.                   See Brooks v.\n\nAIG SunAmerica Life Assur. Co., 480 F.3d 579, 590 (1st Cir.\n\n2007)(noting that party urging amendment of complaint at the\n\n\n                                         -41-\n\feleventh hour to fend of summary judgment must demonstrate that the\n\nproposed amendments are supported by the record) (citing Adorno v.\n\nCrowley Towing & Transp. Co., 443 F.3d 122, 126 & n.3 (1st Cir.\n\n2006))); but see González-Pérez v. Hosp. Interamericano de Medicina\n\nAvanzada, 355 F.3d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir. 2004) (declining to find that\n\ndistrict   court   abused      discretion   in   permitting   defendant   to\n\ninterpose timeliness defense supported by the record for the first\n\ntime at summary judgment).        Consequently, we affirm the district\n\ncourt's refusal to consider the appellant's claim for relief under\n\nthe covenant of good faith and fair dealing.         We express no opinion\n\nwhether this claim would have been meritorious if adequately pled,\n\nbut we note that the covenant of good faith and fair dealing is\n\nimplied in every contract, including those involving rights of\n\nfirst refusal.     Uno Rests., Inc., 805 N.E.2d at 964.\n\n                          E.    Remaining Claims\n\n           In addition to these claims, the appellant has advanced\n\na number of others, accusing the Town and the Trust of fraud and\n\nmisrepresentation, intentional interference with her contractual\n\nrelations with Cohousing, and through 42 U.S.C. § 1983, a violation\n\nof the Contracts Clause of the U.S. Constitution. We have reviewed\n\nthese claims and find them to be without merit.\n\n                    1.   Fraud and Misrepresentation\n\n           As to the fraud and misrepresentation claim, the district\n\ncourt correctly noted that Kunelius had produced enough evidence to\n\n\n                                    -42-\n\fpermit an inference that TPL misrepresented both its ability and\n\nintent to purchase the property.   Kunelius, 2008 WL 4372752 at *6.\n\nThe court, however, also correctly concluded that Kunelius did not\n\nprove her reliance on any material misrepresentations made by the\n\nTrust.    The appellant's brief on appeal identifies no legally\n\ncognizable reliance. Accordingly, summary judgment was appropriate\n\nas to that count.\n\n     2.   Intentional Interference with Contractual Relations\n\n           Kunelius's argument on appeal regarding the intentional\n\ninterference claim is that it was \"erroneous for the [district\n\ncourt] to apply the more traditional intentional interference\n\nrequirements, as the [district court] did in the instant case.\"\n\nThe appellant has cited no case law or other indication that the\n\nSJC would modify these causes of action in her favor to account for\n\nthe wrinkle of the statutory ROFR.      Accordingly, we, like the\n\ndistrict court, are powerless to modify them.     We discern no error\n\nin the district court's application of the traditional standards\n\nfor intentional interference with contractual relations in this\n\ncase, see Kunelius, 2008 WL 4372752 at *5 (citing Draghetti v.\n\nChmielewski, 626 N.E.2d 826, 868 (Mass. 1994)), and therefore that\n\ndecision is affirmed.\n\n                    3.   Contracts Clause Claim\n\n           In perhaps her most ambitious and overreaching claim,\n\nKunelius claims that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 61, § 8 impermissibly\n\n\n                                -43-\n\fimpairs   a    contractual    obligation    and    therefore    violates     the\n\nContracts Clause of the U.S. Constitution.              U.S. Const. art. I, §\n\n10 cl. 1.     (\"No state shall . . . pass any . . . Law impairing the\n\nObligation of Contracts.\").       We need not grapple with the question\n\nof whether a violation of the Contracts Clause is actionable under\n\n§ 1983, or as the district court did, with whether the Trust's\n\nactions constituted state action, because we conclude that under\n\nthe circumstances of this case the exercise of the ROFR, even with\n\nthe   Trust's    subsequent   default,     was    not   a   violation   of   the\n\nContracts Clause.\n\n              It has long been understood that the seemingly absolute\n\nprohibition in the Contracts clause \"must be accommodated to the\n\ninherent police power of the State 'to safeguard the vital interest\n\nof its people.'\"     Energy Reserves Group v. Kan. Power & Light Co.,\n\n459 U.S. 400, 410 (1983) (quoting Home Bldg. & Loan Ass'n v.\n\nBlaisdell, 290 U.S. 398, 434 (1934)).             Therefore, as the Supreme\n\nCourt has made clear, the Contracts Clause is not implicated unless\n\na change in state law impairs a contractual obligation, and such\n\nimpairment is substantial.       Alliance of Auto. Mfrs. v. Gwadosky,\n\n430 F.3d 30, 42 (1st Cir. 2005).      In the present case, there was no\n\nchange in state law, and further the ROFR at issue here, which\n\nallows a municipality -- or its chosen nonprofit -- to purchase\n\nland on the same terms as those in a bona fide offer, is not an\n\nimpermissibly substantial impairment of a contractual right, if it\n\n\n                                   -44-\n\fis an impairment at all.      Id. (citing McGrath v. R.I. Ret. Bd., 88\n\nF.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir. 1996) (noting that even an impairment of\n\ncontract that is substantial will be upheld if it is reasonable and\n\nnecessary to fulfill an important public purpose).            Accordingly,\n\nthe grant of summary judgment as to the Contracts Clause claim was\n\nproper.\n\n                             III.   Conclusion\n\n            The   district   court's   grant   of   summary   judgment   is\n\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -45-\n\f",

Ecker, with whom Deidre Brennan Regan and Brody, Hardoon, Perkins &amp; Kesten, LLP, were on brief for appellee Town of Stow.</p>\n<p>Before Torruella, Lipez and Howard, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>HOWARD, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Similar to other states, Massachusetts provides tax relief to landowners of agricultural, horticultural or forest land. When such land is converted to other uses, the Commonwealth requires landowners to compensate their respective municipalities. The compensation may be take the form of, for example, payment of a conveyance tax when the land is sold, or payment of roll-back taxes if the land otherwise ceases to qualify for preferential tax treatment. In addition to these tax features, Massachusetts law also provides that once a landowner decides to sell the land for other than agricultural, horticultural, or as relevant here, forest uses, the municipality is entitled to a right of first refusal (\"ROFR\"). Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 61. This ROFR provides the municipality with a 120-day period in which to meet a bona fide offer to purchase the land. The municipality thus has the right but not the obligation to preserve salutary land uses by purchasing land that the landowner desires to sell, and the landowner receives the compensation that a willing buyer in an arm's-length transaction is prepared to pay.</p>\n<p>In this case, plaintiff-appellant Marilyn Kunelius accepted a bona fide offer to purchase a parcel of land, which included acreage that had been certified under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 61 as forest land. Pursuant to the statute, the Town of Stow chose to exercise its ROFR. In addition, the Town assigned this right, as also permitted by the statute, to the Trust for Public Land (\"TPL\" or \"Trust\"), a nonprofit conservation organization. From the beginning, it was clear that a number of circumstances had to align in a precise constellation for the Trust and the Town to consummate the transaction. Despite potential difficulties with the transaction, the Town and TPL nevertheless went through with the assignment of the ROFR. The Trust's optimistic hopes for obtaining private philanthropy, state grants, and local zoning relief, however, were not fulfilled. As a result, the Town and the Trust failed to complete the transaction. In the interim, Kunelius's previous buyer chose to develop other land.</p>\n<p>Conceding that it had breached its obligations under its contract with Kunelius, the Trust paid liquidated damages in the amount specified in the purchase and sale contract that had been negotiated between Kunelius and her original buyer. Kunelius, however, believing that she was entitled to significantly more, brought suit in the district court. The complaint sought several species of relief, including the invalidation of the liquidated damages clause, specific performance or full contract damages, remedies for the Town and Trust's breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, relief under the business-to-business provisions of Chapter 93A, and relief under the Contracts Clause of the United States Constitution. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court granted summary judgment to all of the defendants: the Town, the Trust, an alleged partnership between the Town and Trust, and Trust employee Craig MacDonnell. Kunelius now appeals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Background</h2>\n<p>By and large, the facts are not in dispute, but to the extent that they are, we recite them in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, here, the appellant. See Essex Ins. Co. v. BloomSouth Flooring Corp., 562 F.3d 399, 401 (1st Cir. 2009); CoxCom, Inc. v. Chaffee, 536 F.3d 101, 108 (1st Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. The Original Transaction</h2>\n<p>Beginning in 2001, Kunelius sought to sell her horse farm located at 142 and 144 Red Acre Road in Stow, Massachusetts. The land abuts two conservation areas, the Red Acre Woods conservation area and the Captain Sargent conservation area, and it sits atop the Town's largest aquifer. The total land area of this parcel is approximately 50.67 acres, 42.1 acres of which had been designated as forest land since 1985, pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 61 2. Upon the remainder of the parcel (approximately 8.57 acres) sit a main house and a caretaker's house, as well as the accouterments of a horse farm, including a paddock, barn, and other improvements.</p>\n<p>In mid-2002, Kunelius entered into negotiations with Cohousing Resources LLC (\"Cohousing\"), a consulting company based in the state of Washington that assists local communities in forming and developing co-housing projects. Co-housing projects like the one Cohousing contemplated here place an emphasis on open space and communal living. Because Cohousing requires the groups on whose behalf it undertakes development to commit to a certain threshold level of funding before Cohousing becomes involved, Cohousing's projects have a relatively high probability of coming to fruition. Through extensive negotiation and personal contact, Kunelius, her attorney and her real estate agent came to trust Cohousing and its principal representative, Chris ScottHansen. As a result, Kunelius was comfortable offering terms to Cohousing that she may not have offered to another counterparty.</p>\n<p>Cohousing's initial offer was for a purchase price of $1.1 million, with a deposit of $50,000 to be held in escrow pending closing. In this first signed offer, the only contingency was an evaluation of the property's suitability for the eventual construction of a thirty-unit development. The offer contained a provision that permitted the seller to select from a range of remedies in the event of the buyer's breach:</p>\n<blockquote>Upon default by Buyer, Seller, at its sole option, may (i) retain the deposit as liquidated damages as its sole remedy, or (ii) repay the deposit to the Buyer and subsequently enforce this Agreement and pursue any and all remedies available at law or equity, including an action for specific performance and damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>This offer was not accepted, and negotiations continued. Cohousing's next offer was for the same purchase price, but contemplated that Kunelius would provide substantial seller financing. In addition, the deposit amount was reduced to only $10,000 up front and a payment of $1,500 per month thereafter. The record suggests that the monthly payment was to replace Kunelius's horse farm income, because her customers would likely look elsewhere to board their horses. After a period for the feasibility study, Kunelius was free to make use of the deposits. This revised offer also specifically contemplated the probability that Cohousing would file an application for relief from local zoning requirements, invoking the streamlined approval process for affordable housing set forth in Chapter 40B of the Massachusetts General Laws. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40B 20-23. In view of the anticipated approval process, the time for closing on this offer was approximately two years.</blockquote>\n<p>At Kunelius's request, this revised offer, although written to include all of her property, contemplated the possibility that \"a significant portion of the undeveloped land . . . not to exceed 42 acres may be encumbered by or deeded to the Town of Stow,\" and that this encumbrance or transfer was to occur after all 40B approvals had been made and before closing. The upshot of this feature was to allow Kunelius to receive any tax credit for the transfer or encumbrance.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Finally, the liquidated damages provision in Cohousing's revised offer remained the same as in the prior offer.</p>\n<p>Although Kunelius did not accept the second offer, negotiations continued, and the parties eventually reached an agreement. The terms of the contract, which was drafted by Kunelius's attorney, diverged in several ways from previous offers. The slightly increased purchase price was to be paid in the same fashion as before, with Kunelius holding a note for a portion of the price. The time for performance was set at September 26, 2003, although Cohousing had the opportunity to extend this period for a year if \"the Chap. 40B approval process is proceeding forward.\"</p>\n<p>Among other changes were the inclusion of at least two references to the possibility of the Town exercising its ROFR. One provision stated flatly that \"[i]n the event that the Town of Stow exercises its right of first refusal pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 61, all monies deposited hereunder shall be forthwith returned to BUYER without further recourse by either party in equity or law.\" Another change involved a clarification of Kunelius's right to transfer that portion of her land classified as forest land: after the 40B development was approved and the seller received all \"purchase monies,\" the seller would transfer \"all right, title, and interest in the said 42.1 acre parcel currently under [sic.] Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 61, as a charitable contribution.\"</p>\n<p>For purposes of this action, however, the most important change between the prior offers and the signed contract was the clause specifying the remedies available to the seller in the event of the buyer's breach. The revised clause reads:</p>\n<blockquote>If BUYER shall fail to fulfill the BUYER'S agreements herein, all deposits made hereunder by the BUYER shall be retained by the SELLER as liquidated damages and this shall constitute SELLER'S sole remedy in equity and law.</blockquote>\n<p>Both Kunelius and Cohousing signed this agreement sometime in October of 2002.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. The Town Assigns Its ROFR to TPL</h2>\n<p>Within days of signing her agreement with Cohousing, Kunelius provided notice to the Town, and other parties required to be notified by statute, of her intent to sell all of her 50.67 acres. Spearheaded by a group known as the Friends of Red Acre (\"FORA\"), which included many of Kunelius's immediate neighbors on Red Acre Road, opposition to the proposed co-housing development sprouted quickly. This opposition eventually focused on alleged excess costs the Town would have to bear as the result of the co-housing development. Urging that the Town exercise its ROFR was one of the principal arrows in the opposition's quiver.</p>\n<p>By December 2002, FORA proposed an alternative to the Cohousing's proposed development. The FORA plan provided that the Town would contribute $100,000 from Community Preservation Act funds and $300,000 from general town funds, as well as assign its ROFR to a non-profit conservation group. Additional funds would be raised by selling both homes on the property as affordable housing, and selling the horse farm operations to Eye of the Storm, a non-profit equine rescue organization. (These proposed sales contemplated relief from various zoning regulations). All of the remaining purchase price funding was to come through private donations.</p>\n<p>The Trust for Public Land was identified as the non-profit conservation organization most likely to accept assignment of the Town's ROFR. TPL expressed a strong interest in accepting the assignment, but only if certain conditions were met. Those conditions included the Town's appropriating $400,000 to support the project, FORA and others raising the $22,000 in required deposits under Kunelius's contract with Cohousing, TPL determining that the project was feasible, and its governing board approving the assignment. On January 13, 2003, the Town decided to borrow and appropriate $305,000 from its general funds to support the Town's exercise of the ROFR. (The remaining $95,000 was to come from Community Preservation Act funds). But because the Town wished to exempt the borrowing from the limitations of Proposition 2, see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 59 21C, the vote was tentative, pending confirmation in a Special Town Election. By a vote of 515 to 355, however, Stow voters declined to approve the project.</p>\n<p>Undaunted, FORA and the Trust pushed ahead and convinced the Town to extend consideration of the ROFR to the full 120-day period specified in the statute. During that time, Craig McDonnell, the TPL project manager for this transaction, prepared a lengthy \"Project Fact Sheet\" to brief TPL's governing board on the project and assist the board in arriving at a decision about how to proceed. In this document, McDonnell explained that Kunelius was planning to deed most of forest acres to the Town free of charge, but that TPL's involvement in the project would result in the conservation of three additional acres and provide the Town access to a pond on the 8.57 acres that Cohousing was planning to develop for fire suppression purposes.</p>\n<p>As to the financing and risks of the proposal, McDonnell noted that with the failure of the appropriation, TPL would have to accept the assignment before the Town could replace the defeated $300,000 appropriation with additional Community Preservation Act funds, but that this risk was mitigated by the fact that he believed that TPL's exposure was limited to liquidated damages in the amount of $22,000, as provided in the contract between Kunelius and Cohousing. (Concomitantly, with this candid private assessment of TPL's obligations and exposure with respect to this transaction, McDonnell publicly made disparaging statements about developers and touted TPL's commitment to complete the transaction and make Kunelius \"whole.\") McDonnell further noted that Kunelius was upset at the prospect of the Town assigning its ROFR to the Trust. He suggested, however, that the litigation risk was \"minimal\" due to the clarity of the liquidated damages clause, and he predicted that the Trust would prevail on summary judgment after minimal discovery in any suit brought by Kunelius. Eventually, TPL's governing board approved the acceptance of the assignment, but the board nonetheless withheld authority for TPL to close on the transaction.</p>\n<p>Armed with this limited authority, McDonnell went ahead with efforts to acquire an assignment of the ROFR. Without disclosing to the Town the constraints placed on TPL, McDonnell negotiated with the Town's Board of Selectmen regarding the terms under which TPL would accept the assignment. By and large, the negotiations did not reflect significant disagreement between the Town and TPL, although TPL refused to indemnify the Town for potential damages or defense costs in the event of potential litigation. TPL did acknowledge that \"the decided cases under Chapter 61 do not explicitly resolve all of the potential issues that arise when a municipality assigns its right of first refusal to a nonprofit conservation organization, including which terms of the underlying contract should obligate the assignee.\"</p>\n<p>At a Board of Selectmen meeting on February 11, 2003,<sup>[2]</sup> days before the Town's ROFR was scheduled to lapse, the Town assigned the ROFR to the Trust on the terms described above. At the meeting, McDonnell gave a presentation describing the benefits of the transaction and urged approval of the assignment, but McDonnell did not disclose the conditions that the Trust's governing board placed on its acceptance of the assignment. By a vote of three to one, the Town's Board of Selectmen voted to assign the ROFR to the Trust, which the Trust accepted in writing the next day. In due course, Kunelius was provided with written notice that the Town had assigned the ROFR to the Trust, which provided notice of its acceptance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. The Transaction Sours</h2>\n<p>About a month later, by March 19, 2003, McDonnell was singing a different tune. On that date, McDonnell wrote in confidence to members of FORA, \"I recently have spent some time thinking through this project in detail . . . and have a realized that a number of key assumptions about structure and timing are unworkable.\" In an attached confidential memorandum, McDonnell explained that the TPL would require $1.154 million at closing and proposed relying on Eye of the Storm, a fledgling non-profit with little infrastructure, to raise $400,000 either through fundraising or a loan secured by its interest in 144 Red Acre Road before closing. In addition, McDonnell contemplated raising $450,000 through private philanthropy prior to closing.</p>\n<p>FORA agreed with these observations but concluded that McDonnell's proposed fund raising timetable was overly optimistic and urged the Trust to close with borrowed funds. To that end, FORA arranged for a line of credit for the Trust.</p>\n<p>McDonnell replied with another confidential memorandum dated March 27, after the assignment but before the Town provided any funds. In this memorandum, for the first time, McDonnell disclosed to FORA that \"TPL's national board has given only a tentative approval to this excellent adventure we are undertaking together. . . . We have not received the go-ahead to actually purchase the property. Our board is awaiting progress on both the political and fundraising fronts. Unless we secure approval at the May town meeting and make substantial progress on the remaining finances, I do not believe we will get national approval for this project.\"<sup>[3]</sup> Although McDonnell did not foreclose the possibility of TPL's obtaining \"conservation financing,\" he made clear that it would have to be limited to $600,000, the combined value of the main house and the horse farm/caretaker's house.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>Despite these doubts with respect to the financing of the project, the Trust, FORA, and the Town pressed onward. The Trust and the Town applied for state aid to rehabilitate the two homes on the Kunelius property, and prepared for the Town meeting, which was to confirm the Town's contribution of Community Preservation Act funds. At the meeting, the funds were approved, but this approval marked the high-water mark of the potential transaction.</p>\n<p>Soon thereafter, in mid-June 2003, although contrary indications were evident even before the Trust accepted the ROFR, it became clearer that the Trust's plan of dividing the parcel in order to sell the two homes on the Kunelius property was unlikely to fare well in the zoning process. In another blow to the project, in early July 2003, the State Department of Housing and Community Development denied the grant application to renovate the two houses on the property. The combination of these body blows forced the Trust to ramp up planning for abandoning the transaction, and to that end, McDonnell wrote to TPL colleagues \"I think the most important thing about the `exit strategy' is not to be seen as TPL pulling the plug, but for a consensus to emerge from all that the project has now got some fatal flaws . . . .\"</p>\n<p>The prediction of fatal flaws proved prescient, though some of them were of TPL's own making. Peter Christiansen, a leader of FORA, wrote that McDonnell's conduct led him to \"feel raped,\" and that McDonnell had told him that TPL would neither engage in any fundraising nor supply any fundraising prospects. Christiansen further claimed that the Trust solicited leads that FORA members had identified for funding of other projects. This alleged poaching, combined with TPL's threats to pull out of the purchase altogether, made it difficult for FORA members to harness their relationships with potential donors. Once it appeared likely that TPL would withdraw from the transaction, that appearance would bode ill for FORA-members' relationships with repeat players in the conservation world.</p>\n<p>By July 31, 2003, the Trust informed FORA that it was \"not particularly sanguine\" that the transaction could close. Indeed, TPL unequivocally stated that only price concessions from Kunelius, who was forced to deal with TPL by virtue of the ROFR, could save the transaction.<sup>[5]</sup> TPL then requested $350,000 in price concessions from Kunelius, which she refused. Although TPL and FORA continued to trade arguments about the feasibility of financing, the project was effectively dead. TPL unilaterally withdrew its application for a zoning variance on September 25, 2003, and did not close on September 26, 2003.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Proceedings Below</h2>\n<p>Although further discussions occurred between TPL and Kunelius (sometimes with the facilitation of Town officials), resolution proved elusive. Kunelius filed the present suit against the Town, the Trust, an alleged partnership between the Town and Trust, and McDonnell in his individual capacity.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>After preliminary skirmishing, including the dismissal of one count not at issue here, and after the conclusion of discovery, the district court granted summary judgment to all defendants.<sup>[7]</sup> This appeal timely followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. Discussion</h2>\n<p>We review summary judgment rulings de novo, and the presence of cross-motions for summary judgment does not alter or dilute this standard. Desrosiers v. Hartford Life and Accident Ins. Co., 515 F.3d 87, 92 (1st Cir. 2008). We will affirm entry of summary judgment if the record  viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, including all reasonable inferences drawn in favor of the nonmoving party  discloses no genuine issue of material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Arroyo-Audifred v. Verizon Wireless, Inc., 527 F.3d 215, 218 (1st Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p>We apply the substantive law of the forum state, here Massachusetts, to claims invoking the court's diversity jurisdiction, see Citibank Global Mkts., Inc. v. Rodriguez-Santana, 573 F.3d 17, 23 (1st Cir. 2009) (citing Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 78 (1938)), but we of course apply federal law to the federal claims. Where no authoritative decision from the state court of last resort resolves an issue of state substantive law, we must predict, as best as we can, that court's resolution of the issue before us. Essex Ins. Co., 562 F.3d at 404 (citation omitted). Although we have no single Polaris to guide our prediction of the state court's resolution of such questions, we rely on analogous cases decided in the forum state, persuasive reasoning in cases from other states, and other secondary sources, such as Restatements and treatises. Id. (citing Trans-Spec Truck Serv. v. Caterpillar Inc., 524 F.3d 315, 323 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 500 (2008)).</p>\n<p>We will first discuss the appellant's claims that the original contract's liquidated damages provision does not apply to the Town or to TPL, and that the liquidated damages clause is in any event invalid. After that, we will address the Chapter 93A claim, the claim based on the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Finally, we will briefly discuss Kunelius's remaining claims.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Applicability of the Liquidated Damages Clause to the Town and Trust</h2>\n<p>We begin with the question of whether the liquidated damages clause in Kunelius's contract with Cohousing is a term that inures to the benefit of the Trust and the Town. The district court noted that all parties agree that TPL breached the purchase and sale contract, but they disagree as to the proper remedy. Kunelius sought specific performance or full benefit-of-the-bargain damages, while the Trust claimed that Kunelius's remedy for breach was limited to the $19,000 in deposits and monthly payments that it had already paid and Kunelius has retained.</p>\n<p>The district court observed, as the parties had, that it is unclear whether Massachusetts courts would find that an exercise of an ROFR requires the purchaser to \"literally meet every last detail of the prior offer or only the essential terms, such as, for instance, the identity of the subject property, the price, the time for performance and the like, but not subsidiary agreements, such as, for instance, mortgage contingencies, rights to inspect . . . or pertinent to this controversy, provisions regarding remedies for breach.\" Kunelius v. Town of Stow, No. 05-11697-GAO, 2008 WL 4372752 at *2 (D. Mass. Sept. 23, 2008) (footnote omitted). The district court determined that it did not need to answer this question because the parties agreed that the purchase and sale agreement \"set[] forth the terms of their contract.\" As evidence of this agreement on the part of plaintiff, the district court cited paragraph 58 of her complaint which states, \"The P &amp; S is a valid and enforceable contract between Kunelius and Stow and TPL.\" Id.</p>\n<p>Unlike the district court, we are not persuaded that Kunelius has admitted that the liquidated damages provision applied to the Town and the Trust. Paragraph 55 of her complaint specifically states that \"The obligations of Stow and TPL under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 61 could not be avoided by relying on the liquidated damage[s] clause . . . since such liquidated damage[s] clause . . . was applicable only to Cohousing since it sought certain permits and approvals in connection with its [Chapter] 40B . . . Development.\" (emphasis added). In light of this paragraph, we think that the complaint is best read as asserting that the Town and the Trust's joint exercise of the ROFR, by operation of law, obliged them to purchase the property identified in the contract at the price stated.</p>\n<p>The district court is, of course, correct that the Trust has consistently taken the position that it assumed the role of Cohousing in the contract and that the liquidated damages provision inured to its benefit. The plaintiff, however, claims that through her then-counsel, she communicated to the Town attorney her belief that the liquidated damages clause did not apply to the Town and the Trust. Moreover, the record also reveals that the Trust, in a communication to the Town, acknowledged that the question of which provisions of the P &amp; S apply to the exercisor or assignee of an ROFR under Chapter 61 remains an open question. Ultimately, therefore, we are satisfied that the plaintiff adequately preserved this question below, and has properly raised it on appeal.</p>\n<p>Ordinarily, in Massachusetts \"contract interpretation is for the court, unless disputed issues of fact bear upon the interpretation of ambiguous language.\" Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Greenwich Ins. Co., 417 F.3d 193, 197 (1st Cir. 2005) (citing Fishman v. LaSalle Nat'l Bank, 247 F.3d 300, 303 (1st Cir. 2001)). We have explained that \"judges construe contracts, if only the words need be considered, and the jury does the job under instructions if evidentiary issues have to be resolved.\" Fishman, 237 F.3d at 303 (citations omitted). Here, there are no evidentiary questions to resolve; rather, we must decide, as a matter of law, whether the liquidated damages provision, by operation of law, was made applicable to the Town and the Trust.</p>\n<p>For the reasons that follow, we believe that the Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\") would hold that the liquidated damages provision inures to the benefit of the Trust and the Town. Although there is scant case law interpreting Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 61 8, we may look to case law decided under the nearly identically-worded ROFR provision of agricultural and horticultural lands, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 61A 14. See Comm. v. Smith, 728 N.E.2d 272, 276 (Mass. 2000) (noting that it is most appropriate to use construction of one statute to inform construction of another when the two statutes relate to the same class of things or share a similar purpose) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>At the time that Kunelius entered into the transaction with Cohousing, the SJC had not decided any cases under either statute, but that court has since decided at least two cases under ch. 61A 14. In Town of Sudbury v. Scott, a divided SJC, after reviewing the various features of Chapter 61A, including the conveyance tax, the roll-back tax, and the ROFR, held that in order for parties to the sale of lands certified under Chapter 61A to avoid a municipality's ROFR, the putative purchaser must not have the intent to convert the land to non-agricultural or non-horticultural purposes at the time of purchase. 787 N.E.2d at 544. The court therefore vacated summary judgment in favor of the purchaser and remanded the case for a determination of the purchaser's intent at the time of the purchase. Id. at 546-47. In Town of Franklin v. Wyllie, a unanimous SJC held that a developer's offer to purchase undeveloped land subject to Chapter 61A was bona fide, even though the final purchase price was contingent on the number of lots ultimately approved for development. 819 N.E.2d 943, 948 (Mass. 2005). The court went on to conclude that since the offer was bona fide, had the Town of Franklin chosen to exercise its ROFR it would have been obliged to determine how many lots would be approved for development to fix the purchase price, in order to purchase the property \"on substantially the same terms and conditions\" as those struck between the non-municipal buyer and the seller. Id. at 950 (citing Stone v. W.E. Aubuchon Co., 562 N.E.2d 852 (Mass. App. Ct. 1990)).<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>Thus, neither Scott nor Wyllie addresses the precise question at issue here. Nevertheless, the appellees make much of the fact that in both decisions the SJC suggested more broadly that the statutory ROFR conferred on a municipality under C. 61A 14 and C. 61 8 \"ripen[s] into an option to purchase according to the terms of the offer.\" Wyllie, 819 N.E.2d at 949 (citing Greenfield Country Estates Tenants Ass'n v. Deep, 666 N.E.2d 988, 993 n.14 (Mass. 1989)); see also Wyllie, 819 N.E.2d at 949 (\"There is no indication, however, that the Legislature intended that a municipality's `first refusal option' to purchase would encompass the right to purchase such land on different terms and conditions than [those] set forth in the `bona fide offer.'\" (emphasis added) (citing Scott, 787 N.E.2d at 544 n. 14))). From this language, the appellees argue that they should be obliged to take on no more risk or offer no more certainty that their transaction would close than Cohousing offered in its bona fide offer.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff's position is that she was able to offer a streamlined liquidated damages clause to Cohousing because she had established a considerable amount of mutual trust and understanding with ScottHansen, and because she felt comfortable that Cohousing's development was properly financed and Chapter 40B approvals would be forthcoming. Consequently, the argument goes, it would be grossly unfair to give the Town and the Trust these same concessions, particularly in light of the fact that the Trust's ability to close was tenuous from the beginning and its statements to the contrary were disingenuous. Embedded in this argument is the policy concern that granting municipalities and nonprofits added leverage to disrupt transactions involving certified land would tilt the statutory structure too far toward the municipality and would therefore reduce the number of landowners willing to participate in the scheme.</p>\n<p>These arguments are not without some appeal, although the most obvious response is that Kunelius understood herself to be bargaining in the shadow of the Town's ROFR. She therefore also should have understood the desirability of accounting for the fact that any deal she struck would be available to the Town, or to any non-profit conservation organization to which the Town might choose to assign the lease. She may well have been able to negotiate terms that would have better protected her in the event that less reliable counterparties, such as the Town and the Trust, would become parties to this transaction. Whether or not such terms ultimately would have protected her, we must decide the case on the facts as they are. Despite her knowledge that the ROFR lurked in the weeds, Kunelius in fact did not include any language in the contract to limit her risk in the event of the exercise of the known ROFR.</p>\n<p>In addition to Kunelius's control over the drafting of her contract, the cases at common law (which applies to statutory ROFRs, see Scott, 787 N.E.2d at 543 n.12), cut against her legal position. Most common law courts do not appear to have focused carefully on this question, and thus have not addressed the specific concerns that the appellant identifies, but most have generally stated that once a seller receives a bona fide offer, the ROFR ripens into an option to purchase the property \"at the price and otherwise on the terms stated in the offer.\" T.W. Nickerson, Inc. v. Fleet Nat. Bank, 898 N.E.2d 868, 878 (Mass. App. Ct. 2009) (quoting Frostar Corp. v. Malloy, 823 N.E.2d 417 (Mass. App. Ct. 2005) (emphasis added)); see also Gleason v. Norwest Mortgage, Inc., 243 F.3d 130, 139 n. 5 (3d Cir. 2001) (applying Minnesota law) (citing Allison v. Agribank FCB, 949 S.W.2d 182, 186 (Mo. Ct. App. 1997)); Henry Simons Lumber Co v. Simons, 44 N.W.2d 726, 727 (Minn. 1950). As a result, the holder of an ROFR must have knowledge of the terms and conditions of the entire offer so that the holder may decide if she wishes to meet the offer. T.W. Nickerson, 898 N.E.2d at 878 (citing Gyurkey v. Babler, 651 P.2d 928 (Idaho 1982)); see also Uno Rest., Inc. v. Boston Kenmore Realty Corp., 805 N.E.2d 957, 962-63 (Mass. 2004); Miller v. LeSea Broadcasting, Inc., 87 F.3d 224, (7th Cir. 1996) (applying Wisconsin law) (noting that requirement that holder of ROFR exactly match a bona fide offer is in fact a protection for the grantor of the ROFR). Requiring that the holder of an ROFR have access to such terms would serve little purpose if the holder of the ROFR were not required to meet them.</p>\n<p>Thus, the decisions interpreting the statutory ROFR at issue in this case (or more precisely, its twin), as well as decisions dealing with common law rights of first refusal more generally, all suggest that the holder of an ROFR must meet all of the terms and conditions of the offer, including subsidiary terms such as the liquidated damages clause at issue here. Many courts do, however, make an exception for immaterial terms with which the holder of an ROFR need not comply,<sup>[9]</sup> e.g., W. Tex. Transmission, L.P. v. Enron Corp., 907 F.2d 1554, 1556 (5th Cir. 1990); John D. Stump &amp; Assocs., Inc. v. Cunningham Mem'l Park Inc., 419 S.E.2d 699, 705 (W. Va. 1992); Brownies Creek Collieries, Inc. v. Asher Coal Mining Co., 417 S.W.2d 249, 252 (Ky. 1967), and even those that do not make a materiality exception generally make three exceptions to the rule of exact matching. First, the grantor can waive exact matching by agreeing that certain terms should not apply to the holder of an ROFR. Miller, 87 F.3d at 227; see also State Dept. of Transp. v. Providence and Worcester R.R. Co., 674 A.2d 1239, 1243-44 (R.I. 1996) (state, acting pursuant to a statutory ROFR, did not void the ROFR by pointing out that seller was not required to undertake onerous action that would have been required had the bona fide offer been accepted). Second, it is of course clear that the names of the parties will not exactly match the proper names contained in the bona fide offer when the holder of an ROFR exercises it. Miller, 87 F.3d at 227; Providence and Worcester R.R. Co., 674 A.2d at 1243-44 (noting that name of buyer should be changed to \"the state\"). Finally, courts will relax the rule of perfect matching in the presence of bad faith. Wyllie, 819 N.E.2d at 949 n. 8; Miller, 87 F.3d at 228 (citing Or. RSA No.6, Inc. v. Castle Rock Cellular of Or., L.P., 76 F.3d 1003, 1007 (9th Cir. 1996)). Aside from these exceptions, however, most courts hold that the terms of the bona fide offer become binding on the holder of an ROFR. This authority persuades us that the SJC likely would adopt a similar rule.</p>\n<p>In an argument faintly reminiscent of the third exception noted above, the appellant asserts that the Trust acted in bad faith such that the Trust should not be entitled to rely on the liquidated damages provision. As examples of that bad faith, the appellant points to the Trust's unwillingness to allow her to make a charitable donation of the 42.1 acres, its refusal to proceed under Chapter 40B, and its attempt to lower the purchase price. While declining to proceed with a Chapter 40B application was entirely proper, the Trust's other actions may suggest the possibility of a violation of Chapter 93A, a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, or the Trust's anticipatory breach of its contract with the appellant (the first two of which we address later, and the last being a cause of action that has not found much hospitality under Massachusetts law, see generally Daniels v. Newton, 114 Mass. 530 (1874)). We fail to see, however, in what way these action support an argument for varying the terms under which the Trust could accept the contract. Accordingly, this argument does not disturb our conclusion that the liquidated damages provision applies to the Trust and the Town.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Validity of the Liquidated Damages Provision</h2>\n<p>Having determined that the liquidated damages provision of Kunelius's contract with Cohousing formed a part of her relationship with the Town and the Trust, we turn to her argument that the provision is nevertheless invalid. In Massachusetts, whether a liquidated damages clause is valid and enforceable is a question of law, and therefore we review the issue de novo. NPS LLC v. Minihane, 886 N.E.2d 670, 673 &amp; n.5 (Mass. 2008). Although it was once unsettled, it is now clear that in Massachusetts, the party resisting the enforcement of the liquidated damages provision bears the burden of persuasion. Id. (citing TAL Fin. Corp. v. CSC Consulting, Inc., 844 N.E.2d 1085, 1092 (Mass. 2006)); see also Honey Dew Assocs., Inc. v. M&amp;K Food Corp., 241 F.3d 23, 27 (1st Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p>Massachusetts courts have long accepted contracts with liquidated damages provisions, particularly those involved in the purchase and sale of real estate. Kelly v. Marx, 705 N.E.2d 1114, 1116 (Mass. 1999). Generally, a contract containing a provision awarding liquidated damages to the seller of real property in the event of a buyer's breach will be enforced so long as \"at the time the agreement was made, potential damages were difficult to determine and the [liquidated damages provision] was a reasonable forecast of damages expected to occur.\" Perroncello v. Donahue, 859 N.E.2d 827, 831 (Mass. 2007) (quoting Kelly, 705 N.E.2d at 1115). Under this rubric, Massachusetts courts have specifically eschewed the \"second look\" approach and evaluate both of these factors only at the time of contract formation. Kelly, 705 N.E.2d at 1116. Nevertheless, liquidated damages clauses will not be enforced if they provide for an amount that is \"`grossly disproportionate to a reasonable estimate of actual damages' made at the time of contract formation.\" Id. (quoting Lynch v. Andrew, 481 N.E.2d 1383, 1386 (Mass. App. Ct. 1985).</p>\n<p>Interestingly, most cases challenging liquidated damages provisions do so on the theory that overly large liquidated damage awards impermissibly function as a penalty.<sup>[10]</sup> See, e.g., NPS LLC, 886 N.E.2d at 673. In this case, the appellant complains that the liquidated damages provision was inadequate because it vastly underestimated her damages and therefore functions as a penalty against her.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p>This theory is relatively novel, and the weight of authority is against it. E.g., Margaret H. Wayne Trust v. Lipsky, 846 P.2d 904, 910 (Idaho 1993); Mahoney v. Tingley, 529 P.2d 1068, 1070-71 (Wash. 1975) (\"Except where extraordinary circumstances are involved such as fraud or serious overreaching by the purchaser, a seller who chooses to utilize the device of liquidated damages in an earnest money agreement . . . cannot avoid the effect of that agreement.\"); see also Nasco Inc. v. Pub. Storage, Inc., No. 92-CV-12731-RCL, 1995 WL 337072 (D. Mass. May 20, 1995). Nevertheless, it appears that in Kelly, and the cases decided thereafter, the SJC has left open the possibility that a liquidated damages clause will be set aside if it grossly overestimated or underestimated a party's damages at the time of contract formation. See Kelly, 705 N.E.2d at 1116 (liquidated damages provision will not be enforced if it provides for an amount \"grossly disproportionate to a reasonable damages made at the time of contract formation\"); Howard v. Wee, 811 N.E.2d 1050, 1052 (Mass. App. Ct. 2004) (noting that $1,000 in liquidated damages was not \"unreasonably low,\" but not questioning that unreasonably low liquidated damages can be set aside under Kelly).</p>\n<p>We must therefore determine whether the liquidated damages provision at issue in this case was, as a matter of law, grossly disproportionate to a reasonable estimate of the damages Kunelius would incur in the event that the sale of her $1.16 million property was not successful.<sup>[12]</sup> Massachusetts courts have held that an earnest money deposit of 5% of the purchase price in a contract for the purchase and sale of real estate is reasonable as a matter law. Kelly, 705 N.E.2d at 1117; see also NRT New England, Inc. v. Moncure, 24 Mass. L. Rptr. 599, 2008 WL 4739794, at *5 (Mass. Super. 2008); Old Oxford Realty Partners LLC v. Shea, No. 305754, 2005 WL 1323110, at *5 (Mass Land Ct. 2005). Although we have found one reported decision in which a Massachusetts court blessed a lower amount of liquidated damages, it was in a factual circumstance that differs materially from this case. In Howard, the court of appeals found that liquidated damages in the amount of $1000 was not \"unreasonably low\" considering that this amount was to cover damages incurred over a period of about eleven days. 811 N.E.2d at 1052.</p>\n<p>Here, Kunelius was to receive $19,000 in liquidated damages.<sup>[13]</sup> This amount is approximately 2% of the total purchase price of $1.16 million, obviously less than the 5% that Massachusetts courts have upheld. But Kunelius failed to produce evidence or argue in the district court that the 2% liquidated damages clause was \"grossly disproportionate\" to a reasonable estimate of her actual damages at the time of contract formation, and therefore, this argument has been waived. CoxCom, Inc., 536 F.3d at 110 n.11. As a result, like the district court we too must conclude that the liquidated damages provision is enforceable in this case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. The Chapter 93A Claim</h2>\n<p>The appellant also presses a claim under the business-to-business provisions of the consumer protection statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, 11. It is helpful here to review briefly the structure of the Massachusetts consumer protection statute. Section 2 of this statute prohibits unfair and deceptive acts and practices, see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A 2(a), and sections 9 and 11 provide consumers and \"businessmen\" with private causes of action to enforce this prohibition. Id. 9, 11; see also Lantner v. Carson, 373 N.E.2d 973, 975-76 (Mass. 1978).<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p>In order for a defendant to be liable under the statute for damages from unfair or deceptive practices, the transaction at issue must have occurred in the conduct of \"any trade or commerce,\" see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A 9, 11, which the statute defines as including \"the advertising, [or] offering for sale . . . of [selling] any property . . . real, personal, or mixed.\" Id. (1)(b). Recognizing the potentially broad ambit of this statute, the SJC, relying on the statute's creation of a separate cause of action for \"businessmen\" who are harmed by unfair and deceptive practices, has made clear that \"the proscription in [Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A 2] of `unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce' must be read to apply to those acts or practices which are perpetrated in a business context.\" Lantner, 373 N.E.2d at 976.</p>\n<p>In interpreting section 11, Massachusetts courts have looked not only at whether defendants were sufficiently involved in trade or commerce to be held liable under the statute, but also at whether plaintiffs were engaged in trade or commerce. This distinction is important because Massachusetts courts have understood that the private rights of action found in sections 9 and 11 are mutually exclusive. Frullo v. Landenberger, 814 N.E.2d 1105, 1112 (Mass. App. Ct. 2004) (citing Divenuti v. Reardon, 637 N.E.2d 234, 239 (Mass. App. Ct. 1994)); see also Milliken &amp; Co. v. Duro Textiles, LLC, 887 N.E.2d 244, 259 (Mass. 2008) (noting that ch. 93A 11 is only available after satisfaction of dual threshold inquiries of whether a transaction was commercial in nature, and whether the parties to the transaction were engaged in trade or commerce \"such that they were acting in a business context\") (citing Linkage Corp. v. Trs. of Boston Univ., 679 N.E.2d 191, 206-07 (Mass. 1997))). Thus, in order for Kunelius to move past the threshold on her Chapter 93A claim, she must show (1) that the sale of the entire parcel, including her home and a horse farm, was a commercial transaction, and (2) that both she and the Trust were engaged in trade or commerce, such that this transaction occurred in a business context.</p>\n<p>It is true that the Massachusetts courts have held that Chapter 93A does not \"reach strictly private transactions such as the isolated sale of a private home.\" Begelfer v. Najarian, 409 N.E.2d 167, 175 (Mass. 1980). In that case, the court noted that whether an isolated transaction takes place in a \"business context\" must be determined from the circumstances in each case, such as the frequency of similar transactions, the motivation behind the transaction, and the role of the participant in the transaction. Id. at 176. The SJC has made clear, however, that a commercial transaction need not \"take place only in the ordinary course of a person's business or occupation before its participants may be subject to liability.\" Id.</p>\n<p>Considering these factors, the record can be read to support, at least in the summary judgment posture of this case, an inference that the sale of the property was a commercial transaction. Whether a party is engaged in trade or commerce is a question of fact, see Feeney v. Dell Inc., 908 N.E.2d 753, 770 (Mass. 2009), and thus our review on summary judgment is de novo, with all inferences drawn in favor of the non-movant (here, the plaintiff). The record includes testimony from the appellant's real estate agent that he met Kunelius as a result of the need to move his horses to her farm. He further testified that as of May 24, 2007, the date of his deposition, his horse remained boarded on the appellant's property. The agent testified that Kunelius agreed to permit Cohousing (and eventually the Trust) to substitute a $50,000 deposit for a $10,000 deposit plus monthly payments of $1,500 to replace income she feared she would lose because \"her boarding tenants would begin to leave\" once they learned that her horse farm was for sale.<sup>[15]</sup> This evidence, combined with Kunelius's own affidavit stating that she rented stalls for horses on her property, harvested firewood, and was the barn manager, could permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that Kunelius was not merely selling her home, but her business and the principal source of her livelihood.</p>\n<p>Massachusetts courts have held that the sale of a business or substantially all of the assets of a business can be a commercial transaction subject to the proscriptions of Chapter 93A. Rex Lumber Co. v. Acton Block Co., Inc., 562 N.E.2d 845, 850 (Mass. App. Ct. 1990). In Rex Lumber, the defendant, Acton Block Co., proposed to sell the land and building on which its former business, which had been discontinued for two years, had once operated, in order to fund the retirement of the defendant's owner. Id. at 846. The appeals court nonetheless held that the transaction was a commercial one made in a business context, under Lantner and Begelfer, despite the fact that it was not made in the ordinary course of business. Rex Lumber, 562 N.E.2d at 850. Thus, while it is a close question, we believe that at this summary judgment stage it is possible to conclude that the sale of appellant's horse farm and other property, from which she derived significant income, was a commercial transaction. Similarly, there is enough evidence in the record to support the conclusion that Kunelius was engaged in trade or business with respect to the transaction in which she disposed of all of the assets that she harnessed to produce her income, and fund her retirement, if Rex Lumber is good law. Therefore, the district court was on shaky footing in determining that Kunelius was not engaged in trade or commerce generally or with respect to this particular transaction.</p>\n<p>Relying on our authority to affirm the decision of the district court on any basis made manifest in the record, States Res. Corp. v. The Architectural Team, Inc., 433 F.3d 73, 80 (1st Cir. 2005) (citing Uncle Henry's, Inc. v. Plaut Consulting Co., 399 F.3d 33, 41 (1st Cir. 2005)), the Trust urges that summary judgment was appropriate because the Trust was not engaged in trade or commerce, based on its status as a nonprofit corporation.<sup>[16]</sup> We agree. In Massachusetts, a defendant's nonprofit status is not dispositive of whether it can be liable under Chapter 93A. Compare Linkage Corp. v. Trs. of Boston Univ., 679 N.E.2d 191, 207 n.34 (Mass. 1997) (noting that Massachusetts courts have held nonprofit corporations liable under Chapter 93A) (citing Miller v. Risk Mgmt. Found. of the Harvard Med. Insts., Inc., 630 N.E.2d 304 (Mass. App. Ct. 1994))), with Poznik v. Mass. Med. Prof'l Ins. Ass'n., 628 N.E.2d 1, 3-4 (Mass. 1994) (holding that MMPIA was not engaged in trade or commerce because of its character as a \"statutorily mandated, nonprofit association\" that was \"motivated by legislative mandate not business or personal reasons\" (citing Barrett v. Mass. Insurers Insolvency Fund, 592 N.E.2d 1317, 1319 (Mass. 1992))), and All Seasons Servs., Inc. v. Comm'r of Health and Hosps. of Boston, 620 N.E.2d 778,779-80 (Mass. 1993) (finding that hospital operated by Boston Board of Health and Hospitals, a municipal entity, was not engaged in trade or commerce when it sought bids for operation of vending machines and canteen facility, as this operation was incidental to its charitable mission of providing medical services).</p>\n<p>Determining whether a nonprofit defendant is beyond the reach of Chapter 93A is a \"fact-specific . . . inquiry,\" but a nonprofit defendant will not be considered engaged in trade or commerce when it \"undertakes activities in furtherance of its core mission.\" Linkage Corp., 679 N.E.2d at 209. Nevertheless, when \"an institution's business motivations, in combination with the nature of the transaction and the activities of the parties, establish a `business context' as contemplated in [Begelfer v. Najarian, 409 N.E.2d 167 (Mass. 1980)], G.L. c. 93A will apply because the institution has inserted itself into the marketplace in a way that makes it only proper that it be subject to rules of ethical behavior and fair play.\" Id.</p>\n<p>In view of its conclusion that Kunelius was not engaged in trade or commerce, the district court did not evaluate whether the Trust was so engaged. In our view, the record viewed in the light most favorable to Kunelius, nonetheless requires the conclusion that TPL, undisputably a not for profit organization, was acting in pursuit of its core nonprofit charitable mission of preserving and conserving land. The fact that it planned to purchase Kunelius's property, renovate both houses, and resell one or possibly both of them on the open market was merely a means to an end, and not intended to turn a profit  like a hospital providing limited commissary services  and therefore not actionable under Chapter 93A. See All Seasons Servs., Inc., 620 N.E.2d at 780. In that vein, we note that even in its commercial transactions, the Trust planned to promote its core charitable mission of land conservation by including conservation covenants that ran with the parcels it sold on the open market. Thus, while it may be true that the record supports an inference that the Trust acted sharply in its dealings with Kunelius, the SJC has nonetheless made clear that where a nonprofit defendant is acting in furtherance of its core mission, Chapter 93A is not designed to reach such conduct. Accordingly, summary judgment as to this count was properly granted to the Trust, the Town, and a partnership between the Town and Trust, if any such partnership existed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing</h2>\n<p>The district court found that the plaintiff did not plead a violation of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing in her complaint, but instead raised it for the first time in connection with cross motions for summary judgment. Kunelius, 2008 WL 4372752 at *1 n.2. The appellant argues that her complaint sets forth sufficient facts to state a claim for breach of the covenant and that the summary judgment record permits the inference that the covenant was breached; therefore, she should be permitted to pursue this claim. In support of this argument, Kunelius cites a number of Massachusetts cases explaining Massachusetts state pleading standards, but as we are in federal court, federal pleading standards apply. Jerry Smith and Jeffrey Parness, 2 Moore's Fed. Practice 8.04[1][A] at 8-23 (3d ed. 2007); see also In re Tower Air, Inc., 416 F.3d 229, 236-38 (3d Cir. 2005) (noting that district court mistakenly applied heightened requirements for state notice pleading standard in federal case).</p>\n<p>In federal court, when a plaintiff raises a claim for the first time in response to a summary judgment motion, it is possible to treat the claim as a motion to amend the complaint under Rule 15(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Sover v. Hattiesburg Pub. Sch. Dist., 549 F.3d 985, 989 n.2 (5th Cir. 2008). The plaintiff, however, made no such argument to the district court and has not advanced one here. Therefore, we need not linger over this question. See Cook v. Gates, 528 F.3d 42, 62 n.13 (1st Cir. 2008); Nieves-Vega v. Ortiz-Qui ones, 443 F.3d 134, 137 n.1 (1st Cir. 2006) (finding that claim raised for the first time at oral argument is, at best, forfeit). In any event, it was not likely an abuse of discretion  and certainly not plain error  for the district court to deny such a circuitous request for an amendment after summary judgment motions had been docketed. See Brooks v. AIG SunAmerica Life Assur. Co., 480 F.3d 579, 590 (1st Cir. 2007)(noting that party urging amendment of complaint at the eleventh hour to fend of summary judgment must demonstrate that the proposed amendments are supported by the record) (citing Adorno v. Crowley Towing &amp; Transp. Co., 443 F.3d 122, 126 &amp; n.3 (1st Cir. 2006))); but see González-Pérez v. Hosp. Interamericano de Medicina Avanzada, 355 F.3d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir. 2004) (declining to find that district court abused discretion in permitting defendant to interpose timeliness defense supported by the record for the first time at summary judgment). Consequently, we affirm the district court's refusal to consider the appellant's claim for relief under the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. We express no opinion whether this claim would have been meritorious if adequately pled, but we note that the covenant of good faith and fair dealing is implied in every contract, including those involving rights of first refusal. Uno Rests., Inc., 805 N.E.2d at 964.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. Remaining Claims</h2>\n<p>In addition to these claims, the appellant has advanced a number of others, accusing the Town and the Trust of fraud and misrepresentation, intentional interference with her contractual relations with Cohousing, and through 42 U.S.C. 1983, a violation of the Contracts Clause of the U.S. Constitution. We have reviewed these claims and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Fraud and Misrepresentation</h2>\n<p>As to the fraud and misrepresentation claim, the district court correctly noted that Kunelius had produced enough evidence to permit an inference that TPL misrepresented both its ability and intent to purchase the property. Kunelius, 2008 WL 4372752 at *6. The court, however, also correctly concluded that Kunelius did not prove her reliance on any material misrepresentations made by the Trust. The appellant's brief on appeal identifies no legally cognizable reliance. Accordingly, summary judgment was appropriate as to that count.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Intentional Interference with Contractual Relations</h2>\n<p>Kunelius's argument on appeal regarding the intentional interference claim is that it was \"erroneous for the [district court] to apply the more traditional intentional interference requirements, as the [district court] did in the instant case.\" The appellant has cited no case law or other indication that the SJC would modify these causes of action in her favor to account for the wrinkle of the statutory ROFR. Accordingly, we, like the district court, are powerless to modify them. We discern no error in the district court's application of the traditional standards for intentional interference with contractual relations in this case, see Kunelius, 2008 WL 4372752 at *5 (citing Draghetti v. Chmielewski, 626 N.E.2d 826, 868 (Mass. 1994)), and therefore that decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Contracts Clause Claim</h2>\n<p>In perhaps her most ambitious and overreaching claim, Kunelius claims that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 61, 8 impermissibly impairs a contractual obligation and therefore violates the Contracts Clause of the U.S. Constitution. U.S. Const. art. I, 10 cl. 1. (\"No state shall . . . pass any . . . Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts.\"). We need not grapple with the question of whether a violation of the Contracts Clause is actionable under 1983, or as the district court did, with whether the Trust's actions constituted state action, because we conclude that under the circumstances of this case the exercise of the ROFR, even with the Trust's subsequent default, was not a violation of the Contracts Clause.</p>\n<p>It has long been understood that the seemingly absolute prohibition in the Contracts clause \"must be accommodated to the inherent police power of the State `to safeguard the vital interest of its people.'\" Energy Reserves Group v. Kan. Power &amp; Light Co., 459 U.S. 400, 410 (1983) (quoting Home Bldg. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. Blaisdell, 290 U.S. 398, 434 (1934)). Therefore, as the Supreme Court has made clear, the Contracts Clause is not implicated unless a change in state law impairs a contractual obligation, and such impairment is substantial. Alliance of Auto. Mfrs. v. Gwadosky, 430 F.3d 30, 42 (1st Cir. 2005). In the present case, there was no change in state law, and further the ROFR at issue here, which allows a municipality  or its chosen nonprofit  to purchase land on the same terms as those in a bona fide offer, is not an impermissibly substantial impairment of a contractual right, if it is an impairment at all. Id. (citing McGrath v. R.I. Ret. Bd., 88 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir. 1996) (noting that even an impairment of contract that is substantial will be upheld if it is reasonable and necessary to fulfill an important public purpose). Accordingly, the grant of summary judgment as to the Contracts Clause claim was proper.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The district court's grant of summary judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The record reflects that Kunelius intended to donate the 42.1 acres of forest land to the Town. We need not speculate about her reasons for structuring her affairs in the way that she did, rather than attempting to sell only the 8.57 acres in a transaction separate from the contemplated land donation. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 61 8 (2001) (providing that only land taxed under Chapter 61 is subject to the right of first refusal); see also Town of Sudbury v. Scott, 787 N.E.2d 536, 542 &amp; n.11 (Mass. 2003) (clarifying that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 61A 17 should be interpreted to allow \"the municipality to exercise its first refusal rights as to the portion of the land that is to be separated from the remainder, when sold or converted, as set forth in [Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 61A 14], while the remainder of the land may remain in c. 61A\"(emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>[2]  The day before, on February 10, 2009, The Stow Community Preservation Committee, the body that administers Community Preservation Act Funds, heard a joint FORA/TPL plea to use funds to support the Trust's planned exercise of the ROFR. The Committee voted to recommend that the Town approve the necessary expenditures at the Town's annual meeting in May 2009.</p>\n<p>[3]  There is no indication in the record that these limitations on TPL's authority were disclosed to Kunelius or the Town at this time.</p>\n<p>[4]  In April 2003, McDonnell represented to the Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development that TPL had access to a six million dollar line of credit from a bank and would consider using this resource, even though internal TPL discussions suggested that TPL's governing board was unlikely to approve the use of financing in this project.</p>\n<p>[5]  At this time, TPL received discouraging news on the zoning front: outside counsel advised TPL that approval of the variances was extremely unlikely.</p>\n<p>[6]  On appeal, Kunelius has not advanced any developed argument in support of her claims against McDonnell in his personal capacity, and therefore those arguments have been waived. Pomales v. Celulares Telefonica, Inc., 447 F.3d 79, 85 n.4 (1st Cir. 2006)</p>\n<p>[7]  We note that during the pendency of discovery, all defendants jointly filed a motion to certify a central question of this suit to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. The defendants argued that \"there is no controlling precedent in the decisions of the SJC or the Massachusetts Appeals Court\" regarding whether a liquidated damages clause negotiated between the owner of Chapter 61 lands and a willing buyer should, by operation of law, become a provision that is applicable to a municipality or non-profit conservation organization exercising an ROFR. This motion was eventually withdrawn, subject to renewal.</p>\n<p>[8]  The Massachusetts legislature has since abrogated the rule in Wyllie, and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 61A 14 and C. 61 8 now require that in order to be \"bona fide,\" an offer must not be \"dependent on potential changes to current zoning or conditions or contingencies relating to the potential for or the potential extent of subdivision of the property for residential use or the potential for, or the potential extent of development of the property for industrial or commercial use, made by a party unaffiliated with the landowner for fixed consideration payable upon delivery of the deed.\" St. 2006 C. 394 18, 31.\n</p>\n<p>We apply the law as it was before the legislature amended it, effective March 22, 2007. See Fleet Nat'l Bank v. Comm'r of Revenue, 852 N.E.2d 22, 28-29 (Mass. 2007) (noting that retroactive application of statutes adjusting substantive rights, as opposed to remedies, is disfavored and thus the court employs a presumption against retroactive application that it uses to resolve uncertain cases)(citing Austin v. Boston Univ. Hosp., 363 N.E.2d 515 (Mass. 1977)); see also City of Newburyport v. Woodman, No. 309692, 2007 WL 3256964, at *3-4 (Mass. Land Ct. 2007) (noting that General Court enacted C. 394 to overturn the decision in Wyllie, but that this enactment was not to be applied retroactively).</p>\n<p>[9]  Alternatively, these courts permit the exercise of an ROFR even if there are insubstantial variations between the bona fide offer and the holder of the ROFR's offer, which is essentially the same thing. See Miller, 87 F.3d at 226.</p>\n<p>[10]  There are good reasons to wonder whether worrying about whether liquidated damages take on a penal aspect is wise as a matter of contract law or economic policy. See generally, Charles J. Goetz and Robert E. Scott, Liquidated Damages, Penalties, and the Just Compensation Principle, 77 Colum. L. Rev. 554, 556 (1977) (arguing that uncritical application of the penalty doctrine \"frequently induces a costly reexamination of the initial allocation of risks and may also deny the non-breaching party either adequate compensation for the harm caused by the breach or the opportunity to insure more optimally against such harm\").</p>\n<p>[11]  In this regard, we note that the record suggests that the current, less favorable liquidated damages provision was not included among Cohousing's original offers but was made a part of the agreement that Kunelius's attorney ultimately drafted. While this fact is not dispositive of her claim, it is clear that the appellant was not stuck with this clause as the result of an adhesion contract, and the record further suggests that the appellant did not arrive at this particular clause due to a substantial inequality in bargaining power.</p>\n<p>[12]  In order to uphold the liquidated damages provision, we also need to conclude that Kunelius's damages were difficult to measure at the time of contract formation. In light of the Kelly court's observation that such damages are often hard to value in transactions involving the purchase and sale of real estate, this is an easy threshold to clear.</p>\n<p>[13]  The Town and the Trust had six months to close. Closing had to occur on or before September 26, 2003 because the contract term granting an extension of the closing date was contingent on the \"Chap. 40B approval process . . . proceeding forward.\" Although it could be argued that the pertinent time of contract formation for purposes of evaluating the liquidated damages clause was the time Kunelius negotiated the bona fide offer, evaluating the propriety of the damages clause at the time the Trust exercised its assignment is not a \"second look\" in the classic sense, because it was at that point that the Trust accepted the contract, and an agreement was formed between Kunelius and the Trust. See T.W. Nickerson, Inc., 898 N.E.2d at 878. Rather, a second look occurs when a court evaluates the propriety of a damages provision at the time of breach. See Kelly, 705 N.E.2d at 1116 (explaining that under a so-called \"second look\" analysis, a court looks to the actual damages resulting from the breach) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>[14]  We note that appellant's complaint did not specify whether she was proceeding under the consumer or business protection provisions of Chapter 93A. At summary judgment, counsel for the appellant specified for the first time that she was proceeding under the business-to-business provisions. We note that had the plaintiff proceeded on the consumer prong of Chapter 93A, summary judgment for the defendants would have been appropriate because the plaintiff did not serve the defendants with a demand letter as required by that section. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A 9.</p>\n<p>[15]  The agent testified that he paid the appellant about $250 per month to board his horse at her farm. Thus, the record supports the inference that appellant likely received payment for boarding five horses at her farm at the time she entered the contract.</p>\n<p>[16]  The district court dismissed the Chapter 93A claim against the Town because the Town assigned the ROFR to the Trust and never became a party to the appellant's contract with the Trust. Kunelius, 2008 WL 4372752 at *4 n.7. The appellant has not challenged this ruling on appeal and it is therefore waived. Stamp v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 531 F.3d 84, 88 (1st Cir. 2008). The district court, however, did not have occasion to determine whether a partnership between the Town and the Trust existed because it found that any such partnership was entitled to summary judgment for the same reasons that the Trust was entitled to summary judgment. Kunelius, 2008 WL 4372752 at *1 n.1, *5. As we, like the district court, conclude that the Trust was entitled to summary judgment on this count, we need not decide whether any such partnership existed because it too would be entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n\n</div>",

When such land is converted to other uses, the Commonwealth requires landowners to compensate their respective municipalities. The compensation may be take the form of, for example, payment of a conveyance tax when the land is sold, or payment of roll-back taxes if the land otherwise ceases to qualify for preferential tax treatment. In addition to these tax features, Massachusetts law also provides that once a landowner decides to sell the land for other than agricultural, horticultural, or as relevant here, forest uses, the municipality is entitled to a right of first refusal (\"ROFR\"). Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 61. This ROFR provides the municipality with a 120-day period in which to meet a bona fide offer to purchase the land. The municipality thus has the right but not the obligation to preserve salutary land uses by purchasing land that the landowner desires to sell, and the landowner receives the compensation that a willing buyer in an arm's-length transaction is prepared to pay.</p>\n<p>In this case, plaintiff-appellant Marilyn Kunelius accepted a bona fide offer to purchase a parcel of land, which included acreage that had been certified under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 61 as forest land. Pursuant to the statute, the Town of Stow chose to exercise its ROFR. In addition, the Town assigned this right, as also permitted by the statute, to the Trust for Public Land (\"TPL\" or \"Trust\"), a nonprofit conservation organization. From the beginning, it was clear that a number of circumstances had to align in a precise constellation for the Trust and the Town to consummate the transaction. Despite potential difficulties with the transaction, the Town and TPL nevertheless went through with the assignment of the ROFR. The Trust's optimistic hopes for obtaining private philanthropy, state grants, and local zoning relief, however, were not fulfilled. As a result, the Town and the Trust failed to complete the transaction. In the interim, Kunelius's previous buyer chose to develop other land.</p>\n<p>Conceding that it had breached its obligations under its contract with Kunelius, the Trust paid liquidated damages in the amount specified in the purchase and sale contract that had been negotiated between Kunelius and her original buyer. Kunelius, however, believing that she was entitled to significantly more, brought suit in the district court. The complaint sought several species of relief, including the invalidation of the liquidated damages clause, specific performance or full contract damages, remedies for the Town and Trust's breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, relief under the business-to-business provisions of Chapter 93A, and relief under the Contracts Clause of the United States Constitution. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court granted summary judgment to all of the defendants: the Town, the Trust, an alleged partnership between the Town and Trust, and Trust employee Craig MacDonnell. Kunelius now appeals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Background</h2>\n<p>By and large, the facts are not in dispute, but to the extent that they are, we recite them in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, here, the appellant. See Essex Ins. Co. v. BloomSouth Flooring Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203772\"><a href=\"/opinion/203772/essex-ins-co-v-bloomsouth-flooring-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">562</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">399</span></a></span>, 401 (1st Cir. 2009); CoxCom, Inc. v.

The Original Transaction</h2>\n<p>Beginning in 2001, Kunelius sought to sell her horse farm located at 142 and 144 Red Acre Road in Stow, Massachusetts. The land abuts two conservation areas, the Red Acre Woods conservation area and the Captain Sargent conservation area, and it sits atop the Town's largest aquifer. The total land area of this parcel is approximately 50.67 acres, 42.1 acres of which had been designated as forest land since 1985, pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 61 2. Upon the remainder of the parcel (approximately 8.57 acres) sit a main house and a caretaker's house, as well as the accouterments of a horse farm, including a paddock, barn, and other improvements.</p>\n<p>In mid-2002, Kunelius entered into negotiations with Cohousing Resources LLC (\"Cohousing\"), a consulting company based in the state of Washington that assists local communities in forming and developing co-housing projects. Co-housing projects like the one Cohousing contemplated here place an emphasis on open space and communal living. Because Cohousing requires the groups on whose behalf it undertakes development to commit to a certain threshold level of funding before Cohousing becomes involved, Cohousing's projects have a relatively high probability of coming to fruition. Through extensive negotiation and personal contact, Kunelius, her attorney and her real estate agent came to trust Cohousing and its principal representative, Chris ScottHansen. As a result, Kunelius was comfortable offering terms to Cohousing that she may not have offered to another counterparty.</p>\n<p>Cohousing's initial offer was for a purchase price of $1.1 million, with a deposit of $50,000 to be held in escrow pending closing. In this first signed offer, the only contingency was an evaluation of the property's suitability for the eventual construction of a thirty-unit development. The offer contained a provision that permitted the seller to select from a range of remedies in the event of the buyer's breach:</p>\n<blockquote>Upon default by Buyer, Seller, at its sole option, may (i) retain the deposit as liquidated damages as its sole remedy, or (ii) repay the deposit to the Buyer and subsequently enforce this Agreement and pursue any and all remedies available at law or equity, including an action for specific performance and damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>This offer was not accepted, and negotiations continued. Cohousing's next offer was for the same purchase price, but contemplated that Kunelius would provide substantial seller financing. In addition, the deposit amount was reduced to only $10,000 up front and a payment of $1,500 per month thereafter. The record suggests that the monthly payment was to replace Kunelius's horse farm income, because her customers would likely look elsewhere to board their horses. After a period for the feasibility study, Kunelius was free to make use of the deposits. This revised offer also specifically contemplated the probability that Cohousing would file an application for relief from local zoning requirements, invoking the streamlined approval process for affordable housing set forth in Chapter 40B of the Massachusetts General Laws. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40B 20-23. In view of the anticipated approval process, the time for closing on this offer was approximately two years.</blockquote>\n<p>At Kunelius's request, this revised offer, although written to include all of her property, contemplated the possibility that \"a significant portion of the undeveloped land . . . not to exceed 42 acres may be encumbered by or deeded to the Town of Stow,\" and that this encumbrance or transfer was to occur after all 40B approvals had been made and before closing. The upshot of this feature was to allow Kunelius to receive any tax credit for the transfer or encumbrance.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Finally, the liquidated damages provision in Cohousing's revised offer remained the same as in the prior offer.</p>\n<p>Although Kunelius did not accept the second offer, negotiations continued, and the parties eventually reached an agreement. The terms of the contract, which was drafted by Kunelius's attorney, diverged in several ways from previous offers. The slightly increased purchase price was to be paid in the same fashion as before, with Kunelius holding a note for a portion of the price. The time for performance was set at September 26, 2003, although Cohousing had the opportunity to extend this period for a year if \"the Chap. 40B approval process is proceeding forward.\"</p>\n<p>Among other changes were the inclusion of at least two references to the possibility of the Town exercising its ROFR. One provision stated flatly that \"[i]n the event that the Town of Stow exercises its right of first refusal pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 61, all monies deposited hereunder shall be forthwith returned to BUYER without further recourse by either party in equity or law.\" Another change involved a clarification of Kunelius's right to transfer that portion of her land classified as forest land: after the 40B development was approved and the seller received all \"purchase monies,\" the seller would transfer \"all right, title, and interest in the said 42.1 acre parcel currently under [sic.] Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 61, as a charitable contribution.\"</p>\n<p>For purposes of this action, however, the most important change between the prior offers and the signed contract was the clause specifying the remedies available to the seller in the event of the buyer's breach. The revised clause reads:</p>\n<blockquote>If BUYER shall fail to fulfill the BUYER'S agreements herein, all deposits made hereunder by the BUYER shall be retained by the SELLER as liquidated damages and this shall constitute SELLER'S sole remedy in equity and law.</blockquote>\n<p>Both Kunelius and Cohousing signed this agreement sometime in October of 2002.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. The Town Assigns Its ROFR to TPL</h2>\n<p>Within days of signing her agreement with Cohousing, Kunelius provided notice to the Town, and other parties required to be notified by statute, of her intent to sell all of her 50.67 acres. Spearheaded by a group known as the Friends of Red Acre (\"FORA\"), which included many of Kunelius's immediate neighbors on Red Acre Road, opposition to the proposed co-housing development sprouted quickly. This opposition eventually focused on alleged excess costs the Town would have to bear as the result of the co-housing development. Urging that the Town exercise its ROFR was one of the principal arrows in the opposition's quiver.</p>\n<p>By December 2002, FORA proposed an alternative to the Cohousing's proposed development. The FORA plan provided that the Town would contribute $100,000 from Community Preservation Act funds and $300,000 from general town funds, as well as assign its ROFR to a non-profit conservation group. Additional funds would be raised by selling both homes on the property as affordable housing, and selling the horse farm operations to Eye of the Storm, a non-profit equine rescue organization. (These proposed sales contemplated relief from various zoning regulations). All of the remaining purchase price funding was to come through private donations.</p>\n<p>The Trust for Public Land was identified as the non-profit conservation organization most likely to accept assignment of the Town's ROFR. TPL expressed a strong interest in accepting the assignment, but only if certain conditions were met. Those conditions included the Town's appropriating $400,000 to support the project, FORA and others raising the $22,000 in required deposits under Kunelius's contract with Cohousing, TPL determining that the project was feasible, and its governing board approving the assignment. On January 13, 2003, the Town decided to borrow and appropriate $305,000 from its general funds to support the Town's exercise of the ROFR. (The remaining $95,000 was to come from Community Preservation Act funds). But because the Town wished to exempt the borrowing from the limitations of Proposition 2, see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 59 21C, the vote was tentative, pending confirmation in a Special Town Election. By a vote of 515 to 355, however, Stow voters declined to approve the project.</p>\n<p>Undaunted, FORA and the Trust pushed ahead and convinced the Town to extend consideration of the ROFR to the full 120-day period specified in the statute. During that time, Craig McDonnell, the TPL project manager for this transaction, prepared a lengthy \"Project Fact Sheet\" to brief TPL's governing board on the project and assist the board in arriving at a decision about how to proceed. In this document, McDonnell explained that Kunelius was planning to deed most of forest acres to the Town free of charge, but that TPL's involvement in the project would result in the conservation of three additional acres and provide the Town access to a pond on the 8.57 acres that Cohousing was planning to develop for fire suppression purposes.</p>\n<p>As to the financing and risks of the proposal, McDonnell noted that with the failure of the appropriation, TPL would have to accept the assignment before the Town could replace the defeated $300,000 appropriation with additional Community Preservation Act funds, but that this risk was mitigated by the fact that he believed that TPL's exposure was limited to liquidated damages in the amount of $22,000, as provided in the contract between Kunelius and Cohousing. (Concomitantly, with this candid private assessment of TPL's obligations and exposure with respect to this transaction, McDonnell publicly made disparaging statements about developers and touted TPL's commitment to complete the transaction and make Kunelius \"whole.\") McDonnell further noted that Kunelius was upset at the prospect of the Town assigning its ROFR to the Trust. He suggested, however, that the litigation risk was \"minimal\" due to the clarity of the liquidated damages clause, and he predicted that the Trust would prevail on summary judgment after minimal discovery in any suit brought by Kunelius. Eventually, TPL's governing board approved the acceptance of the assignment, but the board nonetheless withheld authority for TPL to close on the transaction.</p>\n<p>Armed with this limited authority, McDonnell went ahead with efforts to acquire an assignment of the ROFR. Without disclosing to the Town the constraints placed on TPL, McDonnell negotiated with the Town's Board of Selectmen regarding the terms under which TPL would accept the assignment. By and large, the negotiations did not reflect significant disagreement between the Town and TPL, although TPL refused to indemnify the Town for potential damages or defense costs in the event of potential litigation. TPL did acknowledge that \"the decided cases under Chapter 61 do not explicitly resolve all of the potential issues that arise when a municipality assigns its right of first refusal to a nonprofit conservation organization, including which terms of the underlying contract should obligate the assignee.\"</p>\n<p>At a Board of Selectmen meeting on February 11, 2003,<sup>[2]</sup> days before the Town's ROFR was scheduled to lapse, the Town assigned the ROFR to the Trust on the terms described above. At the meeting, McDonnell gave a presentation describing the benefits of the transaction and urged approval of the assignment, but McDonnell did not disclose the conditions that the Trust's governing board placed on its acceptance of the assignment. By a vote of three to one, the Town's Board of Selectmen voted to assign the ROFR to the Trust, which the Trust accepted in writing the next day. In due course, Kunelius was provided with written notice that the Town had assigned the ROFR to the Trust, which provided notice of its acceptance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. The Transaction Sours</h2>\n<p>About a month later, by March 19, 2003, McDonnell was singing a different tune. On that date, McDonnell wrote in confidence to members of FORA, \"I recently have spent some time thinking through this project in detail . . . and have a realized that a number of key assumptions about structure and timing are unworkable.\" In an attached confidential memorandum, McDonnell explained that the TPL would require $1.154 million at closing and proposed relying on Eye of the Storm, a fledgling non-profit with little infrastructure, to raise $400,000 either through fundraising or a loan secured by its interest in 144 Red Acre Road before closing. In addition, McDonnell contemplated raising $450,000 through private philanthropy prior to closing.</p>\n<p>FORA agreed with these observations but concluded that McDonnell's proposed fund raising timetable was overly optimistic and urged the Trust to close with borrowed funds. To that end, FORA arranged for a line of credit for the Trust.</p>\n<p>McDonnell replied with another confidential memorandum dated March 27, after the assignment but before the Town provided any funds. In this memorandum, for the first time, McDonnell disclosed to FORA that \"TPL's national board has given only a tentative approval to this excellent adventure we are undertaking together. . . . We have not received the go-ahead to actually purchase the property. Our board is awaiting progress on both the political and fundraising fronts. Unless we secure approval at the May town meeting and make substantial progress on the remaining finances, I do not believe we will get national approval for this project.\"<sup>[3]</sup> Although McDonnell did not foreclose the possibility of TPL's obtaining \"conservation financing,\" he made clear that it would have to be limited to $600,000, the combined value of the main house and the horse farm/caretaker's house.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>Despite these doubts with respect to the financing of the project, the Trust, FORA, and the Town pressed onward. The Trust and the Town applied for state aid to rehabilitate the two homes on the Kunelius property, and prepared for the Town meeting, which was to confirm the Town's contribution of Community Preservation Act funds. At the meeting, the funds were approved, but this approval marked the high-water mark of the potential transaction.</p>\n<p>Soon thereafter, in mid-June 2003, although contrary indications were evident even before the Trust accepted the ROFR, it became clearer that the Trust's plan of dividing the parcel in order to sell the two homes on the Kunelius property was unlikely to fare well in the zoning process. In another blow to the project, in early July 2003, the State Department of Housing and Community Development denied the grant application to renovate the two houses on the property. The combination of these body blows forced the Trust to ramp up planning for abandoning the transaction, and to that end, McDonnell wrote to TPL colleagues \"I think the most important thing about the `exit strategy' is not to be seen as TPL pulling the plug, but for a consensus to emerge from all that the project has now got some fatal flaws . . . .\"</p>\n<p>The prediction of fatal flaws proved prescient, though some of them were of TPL's own making. Peter Christiansen, a leader of FORA, wrote that McDonnell's conduct led him to \"feel raped,\" and that McDonnell had told him that TPL would neither engage in any fundraising nor supply any fundraising prospects. Christiansen further claimed that the Trust solicited leads that FORA members had identified for funding of other projects. This alleged poaching, combined with TPL's threats to pull out of the purchase altogether, made it difficult for FORA members to harness their relationships with potential donors. Once it appeared likely that TPL would withdraw from the transaction, that appearance would bode ill for FORA-members' relationships with repeat players in the conservation world.</p>\n<p>By July 31, 2003, the Trust informed FORA that it was \"not particularly sanguine\" that the transaction could close. Indeed, TPL unequivocally stated that only price concessions from Kunelius, who was forced to deal with TPL by virtue of the ROFR, could save the transaction.<sup>[5]</sup> TPL then requested $350,000 in price concessions from Kunelius, which she refused. Although TPL and FORA continued to trade arguments about the feasibility of financing, the project was effectively dead. TPL unilaterally withdrew its application for a zoning variance on September 25, 2003, and did not close on September 26, 2003.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Proceedings Below</h2>\n<p>Although further discussions occurred between TPL and Kunelius (sometimes with the facilitation of Town officials), resolution proved elusive. Kunelius filed the present suit against the Town, the Trust, an alleged partnership between the Town and Trust, and McDonnell in his individual capacity.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>After preliminary skirmishing, including the dismissal of one count not at issue here, and after the conclusion of discovery, the district court granted summary judgment to all defendants.<sup>[7]</sup> This appeal timely followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.

After that, we will address the Chapter 93A claim, the claim based on the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Finally, we will briefly discuss Kunelius's remaining claims.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Applicability of the Liquidated Damages Clause to the Town and Trust</h2>\n<p>We begin with the question of whether the liquidated damages clause in Kunelius's contract with Cohousing is a term that inures to the benefit of the Trust and the Town. The district court noted that all parties agree that TPL breached the purchase and sale contract, but they disagree as to the proper remedy. Kunelius sought specific performance or full benefit-of-the-bargain damages, while the Trust claimed that Kunelius's remedy for breach was limited to the $19,000 in deposits and monthly payments that it had already paid and Kunelius has retained.</p>\n<p>The district court observed, as the parties had, that it is unclear whether Massachusetts courts would find that an exercise of an ROFR requires the purchaser to \"literally meet every last detail of the prior offer or only the essential terms, such as, for instance, the identity of the subject property, the price, the time for performance and the like, but not subsidiary agreements, such as, for instance, mortgage contingencies, rights to inspect . . . or pertinent to this controversy, provisions regarding remedies for breach.\" Kunelius v. Town of Stow, No. 05-11697-GAO, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4372752</span></span> at *2 (D. Mass. Sept. 23, 2008) (footnote omitted). The district court determined that it did not need to answer this question because the parties agreed that the purchase and sale agreement \"set[] forth the terms of their contract.\" As evidence of this agreement on the part of plaintiff, the district court cited paragraph 58 of her complaint which states, \"The P &amp; S is a valid and enforceable contract between Kunelius and Stow and TPL.\" Id.</p>\n<p>Unlike the district court, we are not persuaded that Kunelius has admitted that the liquidated damages provision applied to the Town and the Trust. Paragraph 55 of her complaint specifically states that \"The obligations of Stow and TPL under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 61 could not be avoided by relying on the liquidated damage[s] clause . . . since such liquidated damage[s] clause . . . was applicable only to Cohousing since it sought certain permits and approvals in connection with its [Chapter] 40B . . . Development.\" (emphasis added). In light of this paragraph, we think that the complaint is best read as asserting that the Town and the Trust's joint exercise of the ROFR, by operation of law, obliged them to purchase the property identified in the contract at the price stated.</p>\n<p>The district court is, of course, correct that the Trust has consistently taken the position that it assumed the role of Cohousing in the contract and that the liquidated damages provision inured to its benefit. The plaintiff, however, claims that through her then-counsel, she communicated to the Town attorney her belief that the liquidated damages clause did not apply to the Town and the Trust. Moreover, the record also reveals that the Trust, in a communication to the Town, acknowledged that the question of which provisions of the P &amp; S apply to the exercisor or assignee of an ROFR under Chapter 61 remains an open question. Ultimately, therefore, we are satisfied that the plaintiff adequately preserved this question below, and has properly raised it on appeal.</p>\n<p>Ordinarily, in Massachusetts \"contract interpretation is for the court, unless disputed issues of fact bear upon the interpretation of ambiguous language.\" Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Greenwich Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></span>, 197 (1st Cir. 2005) (citing Fishman v. LaSalle Nat'l Bank, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199389\"><a href=\"/opinion/199389/fishman-v-lasalle-national/\"><span class=\"volume\">247</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">300</span></a></span>, 303 (1st Cir. 2001)). We have explained that \"judges construe contracts, if only the words need be considered, and the jury does the job under instructions if evidentiary issues have to be resolved.\" Fishman, 237 F.3d at 303 (citations omitted). Here, there are no evidentiary questions to resolve; rather, we must decide, as a matter of law, whether the liquidated damages provision, by operation of law, was made applicable to the Town and the Trust.</p>\n<p>For the reasons that follow, we believe that the Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\") would hold that the liquidated damages provision inures to the benefit of the Trust and the Town. Although there is scant case law interpreting Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 61 8, we may look to case law decided under the nearly identically-worded ROFR provision of agricultural and horticultural lands, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 61A 14. See Comm. v. Smith, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">728</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></span>, 276 (Mass. 2000) (noting that it is most appropriate to use construction of one statute to inform construction of another when the two statutes relate to the same class of things or share a similar purpose) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>At the time that Kunelius entered into the transaction with Cohousing, the SJC had not decided any cases under either statute, but that court has since decided at least two cases under ch. 61A 14. In Town of Sudbury v. Scott, a divided SJC, after reviewing the various features of Chapter 61A, including the conveyance tax, the roll-back tax, and the ROFR, held that in order for parties to the sale of lands certified under Chapter 61A to avoid a municipality's ROFR, the putative purchaser must not have the intent to convert the land to non-agricultural or non-horticultural purposes at the time of purchase. 787 N.E.2d at 544. The court therefore vacated summary judgment in favor of the purchaser and remanded the case for a determination of the purchaser's intent at the time of the purchase. Id. at 546-47. In Town of Franklin v. Wyllie, a unanimous SJC held that a developer's offer to purchase undeveloped land subject to Chapter 61A was bona fide, even though the final purchase price was contingent on the number of lots ultimately approved for development. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">819</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">943</span></span>, 948 (Mass. 2005). The court went on to conclude that since the offer was bona fide, had the Town of Franklin chosen to exercise its ROFR it would have been obliged to determine how many lots would be approved for development to fix the purchase price, in order to purchase the property \"on substantially the same terms and conditions\" as those struck between the non-municipal buyer and the seller. Id. at 950 (citing Stone v. W.E. Aubuchon Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2153583\"><a href=\"/opinion/2153583/stone-v-we-aubuchon-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">562</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">852</span></a></span> (Mass. App. Ct. 1990)).<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>Thus, neither Scott nor Wyllie addresses the precise question at issue here. Nevertheless, the appellees make much of the fact that in both decisions the SJC suggested more broadly that the statutory ROFR conferred on a municipality under C. 61A 14 and C. 61 8 \"ripen[s] into an option to purchase according to the terms of the offer.\" Wyllie, 819 N.E.2d at 949 (citing Greenfield Country Estates Tenants Ass'n v. Deep, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">666</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">988</span></span>, 993 n.14 (Mass. 1989)); see also Wyllie, 819 N.E.2d at 949 (\"There is no indication, however, that the Legislature intended that a municipality's `first refusal option' to purchase would encompass the right to purchase such land on different terms and conditions than [those] set forth in the `bona fide offer.'\" (emphasis added) (citing Scott, 787 N.E.2d at 544 n. 14))). From this language, the appellees argue that they should be obliged to take on no more risk or offer no more certainty that their transaction would close than Cohousing offered in its bona fide offer.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff's position is that she was able to offer a streamlined liquidated damages clause to Cohousing because she had established a considerable amount of mutual trust and understanding with ScottHansen, and because she felt comfortable that Cohousing's development was properly financed and Chapter 40B approvals would be forthcoming. Consequently, the argument goes, it would be grossly unfair to give the Town and the Trust these same concessions, particularly in light of the fact that the Trust's ability to close was tenuous from the beginning and its statements to the contrary were disingenuous. Embedded in this argument is the policy concern that granting municipalities and nonprofits added leverage to disrupt transactions involving certified land would tilt the statutory structure too far toward the municipality and would therefore reduce the number of landowners willing to participate in the scheme.</p>\n<p>These arguments are not without some appeal, although the most obvious response is that Kunelius understood herself to be bargaining in the shadow of the Town's ROFR. She therefore also should have understood the desirability of accounting for the fact that any deal she struck would be available to the Town, or to any non-profit conservation organization to which the Town might choose to assign the lease. She may well have been able to negotiate terms that would have better protected her in the event that less reliable counterparties, such as the Town and the Trust, would become parties to this transaction. Whether or not such terms ultimately would have protected her, we must decide the case on the facts as they are. Despite her knowledge that the ROFR lurked in the weeds, Kunelius in fact did not include any language in the contract to limit her risk in the event of the exercise of the known ROFR.</p>\n<p>In addition to Kunelius's control over the drafting of her contract, the cases at common law (which applies to statutory ROFRs, see Scott, 787 N.E.2d at 543 n.12), cut against her legal position. Most common law courts do not appear to have focused carefully on this question, and thus have not addressed the specific concerns that the appellant identifies, but most have generally stated that once a seller receives a bona fide offer, the ROFR ripens into an option to purchase the property \"at the price and otherwise on the terms stated in the offer.\" T.W.

Many courts do, however, make an exception for immaterial terms with which the holder of an ROFR need not comply,<sup>[9]</sup> e.g., W. Tex. Transmission, L.P. v.

First, the grantor can waive exact matching by agreeing that certain terms should not apply to the holder of an ROFR. Miller, 87 F.3d at 227; see also State Dept. of Transp. v. Providence and Worcester R.R. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1986036\"><a href=\"/opinion/1986036/state-dept-of-transp-v-pw-r-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">674</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1239</span></a></span>, 1243-44 (R.I. 1996) (state, acting pursuant to a statutory ROFR, did not void the ROFR by pointing out that seller was not required to undertake onerous action that would have been required had the bona fide offer been accepted). Second, it is of course clear that the names of the parties will not exactly match the proper names contained in the bona fide offer when the holder of an ROFR exercises it. Miller, 87 F.3d at 227; Providence and Worcester R.R. Co., 674 A.2d at 1243-44 (noting that name of buyer should be changed to \"the state\"). Finally, courts will relax the rule of perfect matching in the presence of bad faith. Wyllie, 819 N.E.2d at 949 n. 8; Miller, 87 F.3d at 228 (citing Or. RSA No.6, Inc. v. Castle Rock Cellular of Or., L.P., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"712978\"><a href=\"/opinion/712978/oregon-rsa-no-6-inc-v-castle-rock-cellular-of-oregon-limited/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1003</span></a></span>, 1007 (9th Cir. 1996)). Aside from these exceptions, however, most courts hold that the terms of the bona fide offer become binding on the holder of an ROFR. This authority persuades us that the SJC likely would adopt a similar rule.</p>\n<p>In an argument faintly reminiscent of the third exception noted above, the appellant asserts that the Trust acted in bad faith such that the Trust should not be entitled to rely on the liquidated damages provision. As examples of that bad faith, the appellant points to the Trust's unwillingness to allow her to make a charitable donation of the 42.1 acres, its refusal to proceed under Chapter 40B, and its attempt to lower the purchase price. While declining to proceed with a Chapter 40B application was entirely proper, the Trust's other actions may suggest the possibility of a violation of Chapter 93A, a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, or the Trust's anticipatory breach of its contract with the appellant (the first two of which we address later, and the last being a cause of action that has not found much hospitality under Massachusetts law, see generally Daniels v. Newton, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">530</span></span> (1874)). We fail to see, however, in what way these action support an argument for varying the terms under which the Trust could accept the contract. Accordingly, this argument does not disturb our conclusion that the liquidated damages provision applies to the Trust and the Town.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Validity of the Liquidated Damages Provision</h2>\n<p>Having determined that the liquidated damages provision of Kunelius's contract with Cohousing formed a part of her relationship with the Town and the Trust, we turn to her argument that the provision is nevertheless invalid. In Massachusetts, whether a liquidated damages clause is valid and enforceable is a question of law, and therefore we review the issue de novo. NPS LLC v. Minihane, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">886</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">670</span></span>, 673 &amp; n.5 (Mass. 2008). Although it was once unsettled, it is now clear that in Massachusetts, the party resisting the enforcement of the liquidated damages provision bears the burden of persuasion. Id. (citing TAL Fin. Corp. v. CSC Consulting, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">844</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1085</span></span>, 1092 (Mass. 2006)); see also Honey Dew Assocs., Inc. v. M&amp;K Food Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199282\"><a href=\"/opinion/199282/honey-dew-associates-v-mk-food-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span>, 27 (1st Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p>Massachusetts courts have long accepted contracts with liquidated damages provisions, particularly those involved in the purchase and sale of real estate. Kelly v. Marx, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">705</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1114</span></span>, 1116 (Mass. 1999). Generally, a contract containing a provision awarding liquidated damages to the seller of real property in the event of a buyer's breach will be enforced so long as \"at the time the agreement was made, potential damages were difficult to determine and the [liquidated damages provision] was a reasonable forecast of damages expected to occur.\" Perroncello v. Donahue, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">859</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">827</span></span>, 831 (Mass. 2007) (quoting Kelly, 705 N.E.2d at 1115). Under this rubric, Massachusetts courts have specifically eschewed the \"second look\" approach and evaluate both of these factors only at the time of contract formation. Kelly, 705 N.E.2d at 1116. Nevertheless, liquidated damages clauses will not be enforced if they provide for an amount that is \"`grossly disproportionate to a reasonable estimate of actual damages' made at the time of contract formation.\" Id. (quoting Lynch v. Andrew, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1383</span></span>, 1386 (Mass. App. Ct. 1985).</p>\n<p>Interestingly, most cases challenging liquidated damages provisions do so on the theory that overly large liquidated damage awards impermissibly function as a penalty.<sup>[10]</sup> See, e.g., NPS LLC, 886 N.E.2d at 673. In this case, the appellant complains that the liquidated damages provision was inadequate because it vastly underestimated her damages and therefore functions as a penalty against her.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p>This theory is relatively novel, and the weight of authority is against it. E.g., Margaret H. Wayne Trust v. Lipsky, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1367529\"><a href=\"/opinion/1367529/margaret-h-wayne-trust-v-lipsky/\"><span class=\"volume\">846</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">904</span></a></span>, 910 (Idaho 1993); Mahoney v.

Pub. Storage, Inc., No. 92-CV-12731-RCL, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">337072</span></span> (D. Mass. May 20, 1995). Nevertheless, it appears that in Kelly, and the cases decided thereafter, the SJC has left open the possibility that a liquidated damages clause will be set aside if it grossly overestimated or underestimated a party's damages at the time of contract formation. See Kelly, 705 N.E.2d at 1116 (liquidated damages provision will not be enforced if it provides for an amount \"grossly disproportionate to a reasonable damages made at the time of contract formation\"); Howard v. Wee, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">811</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1050</span></span>, 1052 (Mass. App. Ct. 2004) (noting that $1,000 in liquidated damages was not \"unreasonably low,\" but not questioning that unreasonably low liquidated damages can be set aside under Kelly).</p>\n<p>We must therefore determine whether the liquidated damages provision at issue in this case was, as a matter of law, grossly disproportionate to a reasonable estimate of the damages Kunelius would incur in the event that the sale of her $1.16 million property was not successful.<sup>[12]</sup> Massachusetts courts have held that an earnest money deposit of 5% of the purchase price in a contract for the purchase and sale of real estate is reasonable as a matter law. Kelly, 705 N.E.2d at 1117; see also NRT New England, Inc. v. Moncure, 24 Mass. L. Rptr. 599, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4739794</span></span>, at *5 (Mass. Super. 2008); Old Oxford Realty Partners LLC v. Shea, No. 305754, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1323110</span></span>, at *5 (Mass Land Ct. 2005). Although we have found one reported decision in which a Massachusetts court blessed a lower amount of liquidated damages, it was in a factual circumstance that differs materially from this case. In Howard, the court of appeals found that liquidated damages in the amount of $1000 was not \"unreasonably low\" considering that this amount was to cover damages incurred over a period of about eleven days. 811 N.E.2d at 1052.</p>\n<p>Here, Kunelius was to receive $19,000 in liquidated damages.<sup>[13]</sup> This amount is approximately 2% of the total purchase price of $1.16 million, obviously less than the 5% that Massachusetts courts have upheld. But Kunelius failed to produce evidence or argue in the district court that the 2% liquidated damages clause was \"grossly disproportionate\" to a reasonable estimate of her actual damages at the time of contract formation, and therefore, this argument has been waived. CoxCom, Inc., 536 F.3d at 110 n.11. As a result, like the district court we too must conclude that the liquidated damages provision is enforceable in this case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. The Chapter 93A Claim</h2>\n<p>The appellant also presses a claim under the business-to-business provisions of the consumer protection statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, 11. It is helpful here to review briefly the structure of the Massachusetts consumer protection statute. Section 2 of this statute prohibits unfair and deceptive acts and practices, see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A 2(a), and sections 9 and 11 provide consumers and \"businessmen\" with private causes of action to enforce this prohibition. Id. 9, 11; see also Lantner v. Carson, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">973</span></span>, 975-76 (Mass. 1978).<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p>In order for a defendant to be liable under the statute for damages from unfair or deceptive practices, the transaction at issue must have occurred in the conduct of \"any trade or commerce,\" see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A 9, 11, which the statute defines as including \"the advertising, [or] offering for sale . . . of [selling] any property . . . real, personal, or mixed.\" Id. (1)(b). Recognizing the potentially broad ambit of this statute, the SJC, relying on the statute's creation of a separate cause of action for \"businessmen\" who are harmed by unfair and deceptive practices, has made clear that \"the proscription in [Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A 2] of `unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce' must be read to apply to those acts or practices which are perpetrated in a business context.\" Lantner, 373 N.E.2d at 976.</p>\n<p>In interpreting section 11, Massachusetts courts have looked not only at whether defendants were sufficiently involved in trade or commerce to be held liable under the statute, but also at whether plaintiffs were engaged in trade or commerce. This distinction is important because Massachusetts courts have understood that the private rights of action found in sections 9 and 11 are mutually exclusive. Frullo v. Landenberger, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">814</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1105</span></span>, 1112 (Mass. App. Ct. 2004) (citing Divenuti v. Reardon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2072289\"><a href=\"/opinion/2072289/divenuti-v-reardon/\"><span class=\"volume\">637</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">234</span></a></span>, 239 (Mass. App. Ct. 1994)); see also Milliken &amp; Co. v. Duro Textiles, LLC, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">887</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">244</span></span>, 259 (Mass. 2008) (noting that ch. 93A 11 is only available after satisfaction of dual threshold inquiries of whether a transaction was commercial in nature, and whether the parties to the transaction were engaged in trade or commerce \"such that they were acting in a business context\") (citing Linkage Corp. v. Trs. of Boston Univ., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">679</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">191</span></span>, 206-07 (Mass. 1997))). Thus, in order for Kunelius to move past the threshold on her Chapter 93A claim, she must show (1) that the sale of the entire parcel, including her home and a horse farm, was a commercial transaction, and (2) that both she and the Trust were engaged in trade or commerce, such that this transaction occurred in a business context.</p>\n<p>It is true that the Massachusetts courts have held that Chapter 93A does not \"reach strictly private transactions such as the isolated sale of a private home.\" Begelfer v. Najarian, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></span>, 175 (Mass. 1980). In that case, the court noted that whether an isolated transaction takes place in a \"business context\" must be determined from the circumstances in each case, such as the frequency of similar transactions, the motivation behind the transaction, and the role of the participant in the transaction. Id. at 176. The SJC has made clear, however, that a commercial transaction need not \"take place only in the ordinary course of a person's business or occupation before its participants may be subject to liability.\" Id.</p>\n<p>Considering these factors, the record can be read to support, at least in the summary judgment posture of this case, an inference that the sale of the property was a commercial transaction. Whether a party is engaged in trade or commerce is a question of fact, see Feeney v. Dell Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">908</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">753</span></span>, 770 (Mass. 2009), and thus our review on summary judgment is de novo, with all inferences drawn in favor of the non-movant (here, the plaintiff). The record includes testimony from the appellant's real estate agent that he met Kunelius as a result of the need to move his horses to her farm. He further testified that as of May 24, 2007, the date of his deposition, his horse remained boarded on the appellant's property. The agent testified that Kunelius agreed to permit Cohousing (and eventually the Trust) to substitute a $50,000 deposit for a $10,000 deposit plus monthly payments of $1,500 to replace income she feared she would lose because \"her boarding tenants would begin to leave\" once they learned that her horse farm was for sale.<sup>[15]</sup> This evidence, combined with Kunelius's own affidavit stating that she rented stalls for horses on her property, harvested firewood, and was the barn manager, could permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that Kunelius was not merely selling her home, but her business and the principal source of her livelihood.</p>\n<p>Massachusetts courts have held that the sale of a business or substantially all of the assets of a business can be a commercial transaction subject to the proscriptions of Chapter 93A. Rex Lumber Co. v. Acton Block Co., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2154068\"><a href=\"/opinion/2154068/rex-lumber-co-v-acton-block-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">562</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">845</span></a></span>, 850 (Mass. App. Ct. 1990). In Rex Lumber, the defendant, Acton Block Co., proposed to sell the land and building on which its former business, which had been discontinued for two years, had once operated, in order to fund the retirement of the defendant's owner. Id. at 846. The appeals court nonetheless held that the transaction was a commercial one made in a business context, under Lantner and Begelfer, despite the fact that it was not made in the ordinary course of business. Rex Lumber, 562 N.E.2d at 850. Thus, while it is a close question, we believe that at this summary judgment stage it is possible to conclude that the sale of appellant's horse farm and other property, from which she derived significant income, was a commercial transaction. Similarly, there is enough evidence in the record to support the conclusion that Kunelius was engaged in trade or business with respect to the transaction in which she disposed of all of the assets that she harnessed to produce her income, and fund her retirement, if Rex Lumber is good law. Therefore, the district court was on shaky footing in determining that Kunelius was not engaged in trade or commerce generally or with respect to this particular transaction.</p>\n<p>Relying on our authority to affirm the decision of the district court on any basis made manifest in the record, States Res. Corp. v. The Architectural Team, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201972\"><a href=\"/opinion/201972/states-resources-v-architectural-team/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">73</span></a></span>, 80 (1st Cir. 2005) (citing Uncle Henry's, Inc. v.

In Massachusetts, a defendant's nonprofit status is not dispositive of whether it can be liable under Chapter 93A. Compare Linkage Corp. v. Trs. of Boston Univ., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">679</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">191</span></span>, 207 n.34 (Mass. 1997) (noting that Massachusetts courts have held nonprofit corporations liable under Chapter 93A) (citing Miller v.

Comm'r of Health and Hosps. of Boston, 620 N.E.2d 778,779-80 (Mass. 1993) (finding that hospital operated by Boston Board of Health and Hospitals, a municipal entity, was not engaged in trade or commerce when it sought bids for operation of vending machines and canteen facility, as this operation was incidental to its charitable mission of providing medical services).</p>\n<p>Determining whether a nonprofit defendant is beyond the reach of Chapter 93A is a \"fact-specific . . . inquiry,\" but a nonprofit defendant will not be considered engaged in trade or commerce when it \"undertakes activities in furtherance of its core mission.\" Linkage Corp., 679 N.E.2d at 209. Nevertheless, when \"an institution's business motivations, in combination with the nature of the transaction and the activities of the parties, establish a `business context' as contemplated in [Begelfer v. Najarian, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></span> (Mass. 1980)], G.L. c. 93A will apply because the institution has inserted itself into the marketplace in a way that makes it only proper that it be subject to rules of ethical behavior and fair play.\" Id.</p>\n<p>In view of its conclusion that Kunelius was not engaged in trade or commerce, the district court did not evaluate whether the Trust was so engaged. In our view, the record viewed in the light most favorable to Kunelius, nonetheless requires the conclusion that TPL, undisputably a not for profit organization, was acting in pursuit of its core nonprofit charitable mission of preserving and conserving land. The fact that it planned to purchase Kunelius's property, renovate both houses, and resell one or possibly both of them on the open market was merely a means to an end, and not intended to turn a profit  like a hospital providing limited commissary services  and therefore not actionable under Chapter 93A. See All Seasons Servs., Inc., 620 N.E.2d at 780. In that vein, we note that even in its commercial transactions, the Trust planned to promote its core charitable mission of land conservation by including conservation covenants that ran with the parcels it sold on the open market. Thus, while it may be true that the record supports an inference that the Trust acted sharply in its dealings with Kunelius, the SJC has nonetheless made clear that where a nonprofit defendant is acting in furtherance of its core mission, Chapter 93A is not designed to reach such conduct. Accordingly, summary judgment as to this count was properly granted to the Trust, the Town, and a partnership between the Town and Trust, if any such partnership existed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing</h2>\n<p>The district court found that the plaintiff did not plead a violation of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing in her complaint, but instead raised it for the first time in connection with cross motions for summary judgment. Kunelius, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4372752</span></span> at *1 n.2. The appellant argues that her complaint sets forth sufficient facts to state a claim for breach of the covenant and that the summary judgment record permits the inference that the covenant was breached; therefore, she should be permitted to pursue this claim. In support of this argument, Kunelius cites a number of Massachusetts cases explaining Massachusetts state pleading standards, but as we are in federal court, federal pleading standards apply. Jerry Smith and Jeffrey Parness, 2 Moore's Fed. Practice 8.04[1][A] at 8-23 (3d ed. 2007); see also In re Tower Air, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791140\"><a href=\"/opinion/791140/in-re-tower-air-inc-debtor-charles-a-stanziale-in-his-capacity-as/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></a></span>, 236-38 (3d Cir. 2005) (noting that district court mistakenly applied heightened requirements for state notice pleading standard in federal case).</p>\n<p>In federal court, when a plaintiff raises a claim for the first time in response to a summary judgment motion, it is possible to treat the claim as a motion to amend the complaint under Rule 15(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

The plaintiff, however, made no such argument to the district court and has not advanced one here. Therefore, we need not linger over this question. See Cook v. Gates, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203320\"><a href=\"/opinion/203320/cook-v-gates/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></a></span>, 62 n.13 (1st Cir. 2008); Nieves-Vega v.

In any event, it was not likely an abuse of discretion  and certainly not plain error  for the district court to deny such a circuitous request for an amendment after summary judgment motions had been docketed.

Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202671\"><a href=\"/opinion/202671/brooks-v-aig-sunamerica/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></a></span>, 590 (1st Cir. 2007)(noting that party urging amendment of complaint at the eleventh hour to fend of summary judgment must demonstrate that the proposed amendments are supported by the record) (citing Adorno v. Crowley Towing &amp; Transp. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202128\"><a href=\"/opinion/202128/ortiz-anglero-v-crowley-towing/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">122</span></a></span>, 126 &amp; n.3 (1st Cir. 2006))); but see González-Pérez v. Hosp. Interamericano de Medicina Avanzada, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 5-6 (1st Cir. 2004) (declining to find that district court abused discretion in permitting defendant to interpose timeliness defense supported by the record for the first time at summary judgment). Consequently, we affirm the district court's refusal to consider the appellant's claim for relief under the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. We express no opinion whether this claim would have been meritorious if adequately pled, but we note that the covenant of good faith and fair dealing is implied in every contract, including those involving rights of first refusal. Uno Rests., Inc., 805 N.E.2d at 964.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. Remaining Claims</h2>\n<p>In addition to these claims, the appellant has advanced a number of others, accusing the Town and the Trust of fraud and misrepresentation, intentional interference with her contractual relations with Cohousing, and through 42 U.S.C. 1983, a violation of the Contracts Clause of the U.S. Constitution. We have reviewed these claims and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Fraud and Misrepresentation</h2>\n<p>As to the fraud and misrepresentation claim, the district court correctly noted that Kunelius had produced enough evidence to permit an inference that TPL misrepresented both its ability and intent to purchase the property. Kunelius, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4372752</span></span> at *6. The court, however, also correctly concluded that Kunelius did not prove her reliance on any material misrepresentations made by the Trust. The appellant's brief on appeal identifies no legally cognizable reliance. Accordingly, summary judgment was appropriate as to that count.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Intentional Interference with Contractual Relations</h2>\n<p>Kunelius's argument on appeal regarding the intentional interference claim is that it was \"erroneous for the [district court] to apply the more traditional intentional interference requirements, as the [district court] did in the instant case.\" The appellant has cited no case law or other indication that the SJC would modify these causes of action in her favor to account for the wrinkle of the statutory ROFR. Accordingly, we, like the district court, are powerless to modify them. We discern no error in the district court's application of the traditional standards for intentional interference with contractual relations in this case, see Kunelius, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4372752</span></span> at *5 (citing Draghetti v. Chmielewski, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">626</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">826</span></span>, 868 (Mass. 1994)), and therefore that decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Contracts Clause Claim</h2>\n<p>In perhaps her most ambitious and overreaching claim, Kunelius claims that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 61, 8 impermissibly impairs a contractual obligation and therefore violates the Contracts Clause of the U.S. Constitution. U.S. Const. art. I, 10 cl. 1. (\"No state shall . . . pass any . . . Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts.\"). We need not grapple with the question of whether a violation of the Contracts Clause is actionable under 1983, or as the district court did, with whether the Trust's actions constituted state action, because we conclude that under the circumstances of this case the exercise of the ROFR, even with the Trust's subsequent default, was not a violation of the Contracts Clause.</p>\n<p>It has long been understood that the seemingly absolute prohibition in the Contracts clause \"must be accommodated to the inherent police power of the State `to safeguard the vital interest of its people.'\" Energy Reserves Group v. Kan. Power &amp; Light Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110827\"><a href=\"/opinion/110827/energy-reserves-group-inc-v-kansas-power-light-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">400</span></a></span>, 410 (1983) (quoting Home Bldg. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. Blaisdell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102167\"><a href=\"/opinion/102167/home-building-loan-assn-v-blaisdell/\"><span class=\"volume\">290</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">398</span></a></span>, 434 (1934)). Therefore, as the Supreme Court has made clear, the Contracts Clause is not implicated unless a change in state law impairs a contractual obligation, and such impairment is substantial. Alliance of Auto. Mfrs. v. Gwadosky, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792535\"><a href=\"/opinion/792535/alliance-of-automobile-manufacturers-v-dan-a-gwadosky-in-his-official/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 42 (1st Cir. 2005). In the present case, there was no change in state law, and further the ROFR at issue here, which allows a municipality  or its chosen nonprofit  to purchase land on the same terms as those in a bona fide offer, is not an impermissibly substantial impairment of a contractual right, if it is an impairment at all. Id. (citing McGrath v. R.I. Ret. Bd., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196857\"><a href=\"/opinion/196857/mcgrath-v-ri-retirement-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir. 1996) (noting that even an impairment of contract that is substantial will be upheld if it is reasonable and necessary to fulfill an important public purpose). Accordingly, the grant of summary judgment as to the Contracts Clause claim was proper.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The district court's grant of summary judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The record reflects that Kunelius intended to donate the 42.1 acres of forest land to the Town. We need not speculate about her reasons for structuring her affairs in the way that she did, rather than attempting to sell only the 8.57 acres in a transaction separate from the contemplated land donation. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 61 8 (2001) (providing that only land taxed under Chapter 61 is subject to the right of first refusal); see also Town of Sudbury v. Scott, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">787</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">536</span></span>, 542 &amp; n.11 (Mass. 2003) (clarifying that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 61A 17 should be interpreted to allow \"the municipality to exercise its first refusal rights as to the portion of the land that is to be separated from the remainder, when sold or converted, as set forth in [Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 61A 14], while the remainder of the land may remain in c. 61A\"(emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>[2]  The day before, on February 10, 2009, The Stow Community Preservation Committee, the body that administers Community Preservation Act Funds, heard a joint FORA/TPL plea to use funds to support the Trust's planned exercise of the ROFR. The Committee voted to recommend that the Town approve the necessary expenditures at the Town's annual meeting in May 2009.</p>\n<p>[3]  There is no indication in the record that these limitations on TPL's authority were disclosed to Kunelius or the Town at this time.</p>\n<p>[4]  In April 2003, McDonnell represented to the Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development that TPL had access to a six million dollar line of credit from a bank and would consider using this resource, even though internal TPL discussions suggested that TPL's governing board was unlikely to approve the use of financing in this project.</p>\n<p>[5]  At this time, TPL received discouraging news on the zoning front: outside counsel advised TPL that approval of the variances was extremely unlikely.</p>\n<p>[6]  On appeal, Kunelius has not advanced any developed argument in support of her claims against McDonnell in his personal capacity, and therefore those arguments have been waived. Pomales v. Celulares Telefonica, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202203\"><a href=\"/opinion/202203/pomales-v-celulares-telefonica/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span>, 85 n.4 (1st Cir. 2006)</p>\n<p>[7]  We note that during the pendency of discovery, all defendants jointly filed a motion to certify a central question of this suit to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. The defendants argued that \"there is no controlling precedent in the decisions of the SJC or the Massachusetts Appeals Court\" regarding whether a liquidated damages clause negotiated between the owner of Chapter 61 lands and a willing buyer should, by operation of law, become a provision that is applicable to a municipality or non-profit conservation organization exercising an ROFR. This motion was eventually withdrawn, subject to renewal.</p>\n<p>[8]  The Massachusetts legislature has since abrogated the rule in Wyllie, and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 61A 14 and C. 61 8 now require that in order to be \"bona fide,\" an offer must not be \"dependent on potential changes to current zoning or conditions or contingencies relating to the potential for or the potential extent of subdivision of the property for residential use or the potential for, or the potential extent of development of the property for industrial or commercial use, made by a party unaffiliated with the landowner for fixed consideration payable upon delivery of the deed.\" St. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cow.</span> <span class=\"page\">394</span></span> 18, 31.\n</p>\n<p>We apply the law as it was before the legislature amended it, effective March 22, 2007. See Fleet Nat'l Bank v. Comm'r of Revenue, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">852</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></span>, 28-29 (Mass. 2007) (noting that retroactive application of statutes adjusting substantive rights, as opposed to remedies, is disfavored and thus the court employs a presumption against retroactive application that it uses to resolve uncertain cases)(citing Austin v. Boston Univ. Hosp., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">363</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">515</span></span> (Mass. 1977)); see also City of Newburyport v. Woodman, No. 309692, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3256964</span></span>, at *3-4 (Mass. Land Ct. 2007) (noting that General Court enacted C. 394 to overturn the decision in Wyllie, but that this enactment was not to be applied retroactively).</p>\n<p>[9]  Alternatively, these courts permit the exercise of an ROFR even if there are insubstantial variations between the bona fide offer and the holder of the ROFR's offer, which is essentially the same thing. See Miller, 87 F.3d at 226.</p>\n<p>[10]  There are good reasons to wonder whether worrying about whether liquidated damages take on a penal aspect is wise as a matter of contract law or economic policy. See generally, Charles J. Goetz and Robert E. Scott, Liquidated Damages, Penalties, and the Just Compensation Principle, 77 Colum. L. Rev. 554, 556 (1977) (arguing that uncritical application of the penalty doctrine \"frequently induces a costly reexamination of the initial allocation of risks and may also deny the non-breaching party either adequate compensation for the harm caused by the breach or the opportunity to insure more optimally against such harm\").</p>\n<p>[11]  In this regard, we note that the record suggests that the current, less favorable liquidated damages provision was not included among Cohousing's original offers but was made a part of the agreement that Kunelius's attorney ultimately drafted. While this fact is not dispositive of her claim, it is clear that the appellant was not stuck with this clause as the result of an adhesion contract, and the record further suggests that the appellant did not arrive at this particular clause due to a substantial inequality in bargaining power.</p>\n<p>[12]  In order to uphold the liquidated damages provision, we also need to conclude that Kunelius's damages were difficult to measure at the time of contract formation. In light of the Kelly court's observation that such damages are often hard to value in transactions involving the purchase and sale of real estate, this is an easy threshold to clear.</p>\n<p>[13]  The Town and the Trust had six months to close. Closing had to occur on or before September 26, 2003 because the contract term granting an extension of the closing date was contingent on the \"Chap. 40B approval process . . . proceeding forward.\" Although it could be argued that the pertinent time of contract formation for purposes of evaluating the liquidated damages clause was the time Kunelius negotiated the bona fide offer, evaluating the propriety of the damages clause at the time the Trust exercised its assignment is not a \"second look\" in the classic sense, because it was at that point that the Trust accepted the contract, and an agreement was formed between Kunelius and the Trust. See T.W. Nickerson, Inc., 898 N.E.2d at 878. Rather, a second look occurs when a court evaluates the propriety of a damages provision at the time of breach. See Kelly, 705 N.E.2d at 1116 (explaining that under a so-called \"second look\" analysis, a court looks to the actual damages resulting from the breach) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>[14]  We note that appellant's complaint did not specify whether she was proceeding under the consumer or business protection provisions of Chapter 93A. At summary judgment, counsel for the appellant specified for the first time that she was proceeding under the business-to-business provisions. We note that had the plaintiff proceeded on the consumer prong of Chapter 93A, summary judgment for the defendants would have been appropriate because the plaintiff did not serve the defendants with a demand letter as required by that section. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A 9.</p>\n<p>[15]  The agent testified that he paid the appellant about $250 per month to board his horse at her farm. Thus, the record supports the inference that appellant likely received payment for boarding five horses at her farm at the time she entered the contract.</p>\n<p>[16]  The district court dismissed the Chapter 93A claim against the Town because the Town assigned the ROFR to the Trust and never became a party to the appellant's contract with the Trust. Kunelius, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4372752</span></span> at *4 n.7. The appellant has not challenged this ruling on appeal and it is therefore waived. Stamp v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203356\"><a href=\"/opinion/203356/stamp-v-metropolitan-life-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">84</span></a></span>, 88 (1st Cir. 2008). The district court, however, did not have occasion to determine whether a partnership between the Town and the Trust existed because it found that any such partnership was entitled to summary judgment for the same reasons that the Trust was entitled to summary judgment. Kunelius, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4372752</span></span> at *1 n.1, *5. As we, like the district court, conclude that the Trust was entitled to summary judgment on this count, we need not decide whether any such partnership existed because it too would be entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n\n</div>",
