John A. Woodcock, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Lynch, Chief Judge,\n               Selya and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Richard L Hartley and Law Office of Richard Hartley on brief\nfor appellant.\n     Paula D. Silsby, United States Attorney, and Margaret D.\nMcGaughey, Appellate Chief, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                        October 30, 2008\n\f             SELYA, Circuit Judge.          This appeal requires us to decide\n\nwhether the fifteen-year mandatory minimum term of imprisonment\n\nunder   18    U.S.C.    §   2251(e),    as    applied,    violates    the    Eighth\n\nAmendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.                    For the\n\nreasons      explained      below,     we    conclude     that   it   does       not.\n\nConsequently, we affirm the judgment below.\n\n             The background facts can be succinctly summarized.                  The\n\njury supportably could have found that defendant-appellant Byron\n\nPolk, over the course of some four months, engaged in online\n\nconversations with a person whom he presumed to be a thirteen-year-\n\nold girl.       He pressured her to take and send to him sexually\n\nexplicit photographs of herself.\n\n             The thirteen-year-old girl turned out to be an undercover\n\npolice officer and, in due course, a federal grand jury indicted\n\nthe defendant for attempting to produce child pornography.                   See 18\n\nU.S.C. § 2251(a), (e). The evidence showed that, during the period\n\nwhen the online chats occurred, the defendant was physically\n\nafflicted and confined to a wheelchair. At trial, he characterized\n\nhis   offense    as    an   isolated    and    harmless    consequence      of   his\n\ndisability     and    ensuing   confinement.        However,     other   evidence\n\nsuggested that, at the time of these conversations, the defendant\n\nwas engaging in sexually explicit discussions, in person or online,\n\nwith three other underage girls.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\f            The trial jury convicted the defendant of the charged\n\noffense.    The presentence investigation report told a seamy story:\n\nit revealed an earlier conviction for aggravated sexual assault on\n\na toddler, sexual involvement with teenage girls on at least two\n\noccasions, and yet another series of sexually charged computer\n\nchats with a minor.             The defendant conceded these facts but\n\nobjected to the statutory fifteen-year mandatory minimum sentence\n\nthat he faced as cruel and unusual.\n\n            The district court found that the defendant had not\n\naccepted responsibility.            See USSG §3E1.1.      It set his total\n\noffense level at 36 and placed him in criminal history category I.\n\nThese determinations — all of which are conceded on appeal —\n\nyielded a guideline sentencing range (GSR) of 188 to 235 months in\n\nprison.\n\n            The maximum penalty under the statute of conviction was\n\nthirty years and the mandatory minimum sentence was fifteen years.\n\nSee   18   U.S.C.    §   2251(e).      The   district   court   rejected   the\n\ndefendant's constitutional challenge, finding both the GSR and the\n\nprescribed mandatory minimum appropriate.           The court proceeded to\n\nsentence the defendant to an incarcerative term of fifteen years,\n\neight months.       This timely appeal followed.\n\n            The     customary    appellate    benchmark   for   measuring   a\n\nsentence imposed by a district court is reasonableness. See United\n\nStates v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 260-61 (2005); United States v.\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fMartin, 520 F.3d 87, 92 (1st Cir. 2008).              But an Eighth Amendment\n\nchallenge to an imposed sentence presents an abstract question of\n\nlaw and, thus, engenders de novo review.                See United States v.\n\nRamos-Paulino, 488 F.3d 459, 463 (1st Cir. 2007).                    Because the\n\ndefendant premises his appeal exclusively on the proposition that\n\nhis sentence offends the Eighth Amendment, the de novo standard of\n\nreview   applies   in   this   case.         See   United   States   v.   García-\n\nCarrasquillo, 483 F.3d 124, 132 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n           We begin our analysis by noting an odd twist.                     The\n\ndistrict court did not sentence the defendant to the mandatory\n\nminimum but, rather, to a term of years slightly in excess of it.\n\nThis might seem to obviate the defendant's claim that the mandatory\n\nminimum sentence, as applied to him, violates the Eighth Amendment.\n\nHere, however, the sentence actually imposed was at the bottom of\n\nthe GSR.    The possibility exists that, but for the mandatory\n\nminimum, the GSR would have been more modest and the defendant's\n\nsentence would, accordingly, have been less.                See Gall v. United\n\nStates, 128 S. Ct. 586, 594 n.2 (2007) (noting that the Sentencing\n\nCommission chose to \"key the Guidelines to the statutory minimum\n\nsentences\"). In all events, the sentence actually imposed exceeded\n\nthe mandatory minimum.     For these reasons, we turn to the merits of\n\nthe constitutional challenge.\n\n           In terms, the Eighth Amendment proscribes \"cruel and\n\nunusual punishments.\"     U.S. Const. amend. VIII.            Courts long have\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\finterpreted this venerable phrase to encompass criminal sentences\n\nthat are grossly disproportionate to the underlying offense.               See,\n\ne.g., Solem v. Helm, 463 U.S. 277, 290-291 (1983); Weems v. United\n\nStates, 217 U.S. 349, 381 (1910). Although most frequently applied\n\nin the context of capital crimes, see Kennedy v. Louisiana, 128 S.\n\nCt. 2641, 2650 (2008); Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304, 318\n\n(2002); Woodson v. N. Carolina, 428 U.S. 280, 303-05 (1976), the\n\nprinciple of gross disproportionality also applies, albeit rarely,\n\nto sentences in non-capital cases.          See Weems, 217 U.S. at 381-82;\n\nsee   also   Harmelin   v.   Michigan,      501   U.S.   957,   997-98   (1991)\n\n(Kennedy, J., concurring) (emphasizing that, outside the sphere of\n\ncapital   punishment,   the   gross    disproportionality        principle   is\n\nnarrow and applies only to \"extreme cases\").\n\n             When confronted with an Eighth Amendment challenge under\n\nthe Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, an inquiring court is\n\ntasked to consider three criteria: \"(i) the gravity of the offense\n\nand the harshness of the penalty; (ii) the sentences imposed on\n\nother criminals in the same jurisdiction; and (iii) the sentences\n\nimposed for commission of the same crime in other jurisdictions.\"\n\nSolem, 463 U.S. at 292.        But there is a caveat: a comparative\n\nanalysis is not compulsory.      Id. at 291.        The court need not mull\n\nthe latter two criteria unless the sentence imposed crosses the\n\nthreshold erected by the first; that is, unless the sentence, on\n\nits face, is grossly disproportionate to the crime.              See Ewing v.\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fCalifornia,      538   U.S.    11,    23,    30-31       (2003);    United    States   v.\n\nCardoza, 129 F.3d 6, 18 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n            We      have      recognized          that      instances        of      gross\n\ndisproportionality will be hen's-teeth rare.                         United States v.\n\nSaccoccia, 58 F.3d 754, 788 (1st Cir. 1995).                      That is true because\n\n\"[t]he Constitution does not require legislatures to balance crimes\n\nand punishments according to any single standard, or to achieve\n\nperfect equipoise.\" Id. When Congress has identified a particular\n\nscourge and, using reasoned judgment, articulated a response,\n\ncourts must step softly and cede a wide berth to the Legislative\n\nBranch's authority to match the type of punishment with the type of\n\ncrime.    See Solem, 463 U.S. at 290.              It is, after all, \"Congress —\n\nnot the judiciary — [which] is vested with the authority to define,\n\nand attempt to solve . . . societal problems.\"                     Saccoccia, 58 F.3d\n\nat 789.\n\n            Stern      penalties         are       part      of     the      legislative\n\narmamentarium, and their deployment does not in and of itself\n\nbetoken cruel and unusual punishment.                    See Gore v. United States,\n\n357 U.S. 386, 393 (1958).            Moreover, \"precise calibration of crime\n\nand   punishment\"      is     not    part    of    the     constitutional         regimen.\n\nSaccoccia, 58 F.3d at 787.             \"The inherent nature of our federal\n\nsystem\"   necessarily         produces      \"a    wide    range     of   constitutional\n\nsentences.\"      Solem, 463 U.S. at 291 n.17.\n\n\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\f          Given    the   deference    that   courts   owe   to   legislative\n\njudgments in the area of crime and punishment, it is predictable\n\nthat most efforts to demonstrate gross disproportionality will\n\nfail.   The case law bears out that verity.            See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Frisby, 258 F.3d 46, 50 (1st Cir. 2001) (holding 151-\n\nmonth sentence for heroin distribution based on \"career criminal\"\n\nstatus not grossly disproportionate); Cardoza, 129 F.3d at 18\n\n(holding 235-month sentence under Armed Career Criminal Act for\n\npossession of ammunition not grossly disproportionate); United\n\nStates v. Graciani, 61 F.3d 70, 76 (1st Cir. 1995) (holding 280-\n\nmonth sentence for distribution of crack cocaine not grossly\n\ndisproportionate).\n\n          Here, the defendant's challenge falters at the first step\n\nof the pavane: he has failed to show that his sentence is grossly\n\ndisproportionate on its face to the crime of conviction.                 We\n\nexplain briefly.\n\n          The offense of conviction is the attempted production of\n\nchild   pornography.       As   new    means    of    communication    have\n\nproliferated, child pornography has become a mounting societal\n\nproblem. Consequently, Congress has expended a great deal of time,\n\nenergy, and effort fine-tuning the penalties associated with the\n\nproduction of child pornography.       Over the last three decades, it\n\nhas mandated increasingly severe sanctions for that crime (whether\n\nconsummated or attempted).\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f             That has involved a progression from a maximum penalty of\n\nten years in 1978, to a maximum of twenty years in 1996, to a\n\nmaximum of thirty years in 2003.       By the same token, Congress has\n\nprogressed from no minimum penalty in 1978, to a minimum of ten\n\nyears in 1996, to a minimum of fifteen years in 2003.                    See\n\nProtection of Children Against Sexual Exploitation Act of 1977,\n\nPub. L. No. 95-225, 92 Stat. 7, 7; Child Pornography Prevention Act\n\nof   1996,    Pub.    L.   No.   104-208,    110   Stat.   3009,    3009-30;\n\nProsecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to end the Exploitation of\n\nChildren Today Act of 2003 (PROTECT Act), Pub. L. No. 108-21, 117\n\nStat. 650, 653.      This continuing escalation was based on a grim set\n\nof congressional findings to the effect that the \"prevention of\n\nsexual exploitation and abuse of children constitutes a government\n\nobjective of surpassing importance, and this interest extends to\n\nstamping out the vice of child pornography at all levels in the\n\ndistribution chain.\"       PROTECT Act, 117 Stat. at 676 (citations and\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted).          Congress has found such severe\n\npenalties necessary because child pornography is a \"multimillion\n\ndollar industry\" run by a \"nationwide network of individuals\" who\n\n\"openly advertis[e] their desire to exploit children and to traffic\n\nin child pornography.\"      Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act\n\nof 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-248, 120 Stat. 587, 623.\n\n             The defendant makes three counter-arguments.          First, he\n\ntrivializes the gravity of the offense of conviction.              His brief\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\freads as if there were no real distinction between, say, passing a\n\nbad check or owning child pornography, on the one hand, and\n\nattempting to violate a child by inducing her to participate in\n\nproducing new pornography, on the other hand.                 But this effort to\n\ndebunk the gravity of the offense is tantamount to whistling past\n\nthe graveyard: despite the defendant's disdain, the offense of\n\nconviction is a serious crime.\n\n           In Congress's view — and that is the view that matters\n\nmost — the production of child pornography is a profoundly serious\n\nmatter.      That   is    a   reasonable     value    judgment,      well    within\n\nCongress's   prerogative       to   make.    Saccoccia,        58   F.3d    at   789.\n\nTherefore, Congress was entitled to punish the offense heavily.\n\n           The defendant next argues that his crime was merely an\n\nattempt, not a fully consummated offense.              That argument does not\n\ntake him very far.       Federal law historically has punished attempts\n\non a par with the underlying substantive offenses.                  See, e.g., 18\n\nU.S.C. § 2423(e) (governing attempts to violate the Mann Act); 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1324(1)(A) (governing attempts to violate the immigration\n\nlaws).    In all events, we are unable to discern anything amiss in\n\nCongress's   desire      to   treat   attempted      crimes    as   analogous      to\n\ncompleted crimes for purposes of punishment.\n\n           In our judgment, the absence of such a distinction has\n\nlittle, if any, bearing on the accused's culpability.                 By the same\n\ntoken, it has little, if any, bearing on the constitutionality of\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fthe resultant sentence.   See United States v. Brown, 500 F.3d 48,\n\n60 (1st Cir. 2007) (accepting the validity in a sentencing scheme\n\nof a congressional mandate \"to treat inchoate offenses with as much\n\ngravity as the substantive offenses that underlie them\"); cf. Hutto\n\nv. Davis, 454 U.S. 370, 374 (1982) (holding that imposition of a\n\nharsh sentence for possession of marijuana based on intent to\n\ndistribute does not offend the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause\n\nof the Eighth Amendment).\n\n          The bottom line is simply this: Congress has made a\n\nreasonable legislative determination that a criminal who attempts\n\nto produce child pornography is as deserving of a stiff sentence as\n\na criminal who actually succeeds in producing such smut.     There is\n\nno principled way that the Eighth Amendment permits us to second-\n\nguess that legislative judgment.\n\n          The last potential line of defense devolves from the fact\n\nthat this case did not involve an actual child but, rather, an\n\nimpersonator (an undercover police officer).      Here, however, the\n\ndefendant has not claimed entrapment or police misconduct of any\n\nsort, and the government's use of undercover operatives as a tool\n\nto combat crime is well within the pale.     See, e.g., United States\n\nv. Brand, 467 F.3d 179, 181-82 (2d Cir. 2006); United States v.\n\nSantana, 6 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1993).     Perhaps more important, the\n\njury   supportably   found   that   the    defendant   believed   his\n\ncorrespondent to be a thirteen-year-old girl and intended to\n\n\n                               -10-\n\fextract sexually explicit photographs from her.    Given the jury's\n\nverdict, the defendant cannot be heard to complain that his mistake\n\nof fact absolves him of criminal responsibility. See United States\n\nv. Dixon, 449 F.3d 194, 202 (1st Cir. 2006); United States v.\n\nCotts, 14 F.3d 300, 307 (7th Cir. 1994).   On the same reasoning, we\n\nthink that his mistake of fact cannot tip the Eighth Amendment\n\nbalance in his favor.\n\n            Because we find no gross disproportionality between the\n\nfifteen-year mandatory minimum term of imprisonment established by\n\n18 U.S.C. § 2251(e) and the offense of which the defendant stands\n\nconvicted, we need go no further. The defendant's Eighth Amendment\n\nchallenge fails.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\f",

García-Carrasquillo,</i> 483 F.3d 124, 132 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>We begin our analysis by noting an odd twist. The district court did not sentence the defendant to the mandatory minimum but, rather, to a term of years slightly in excess of it. This might seem to obviate the defendant's claim that the mandatory minimum sentence, as applied to him, violates the Eighth Amendment. Here, however, the sentence actually imposed was at the bottom of the GSR. The possibility exists that, but for the mandatory minimum, the GSR would have been more modest and the defendant's sentence would, accordingly, have been less. <i>See </i><i>Gall v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*76</span> S.Ct. 586, 594 n. 2, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (noting that the Sentencing Commission chose to \"key the Guidelines to the statutory minimum sentences\").

That is true because \"[t]he Constitution does not require legislatures to balance crimes and punishments according to any single standard, or to achieve perfect equipoise.\" <i>Id.</i> When Congress has identified a particular scourge and, using reasoned judgment, articulated a response, courts must step softly and cede a wide berth to the Legislative Branch's authority to match the type of punishment with the type of crime. <i>See </i><i>Solem,</i> 463 U.S. at 290, 103 S.Ct. 3001. It is, after all, \"Congressnot the judiciary[which] is vested with the authority to define, and attempt to solve ... societal problems.\" <i>Saccoccia,</i> 58 F.3d at 789.</p>\n<p>Stern penalties are part of the legislative armamentarium, and their deployment does not in and of itself betoken cruel and unusual punishment. <i>See </i><i>Gore v. United States,</i> 357 U.S. 386, 393, 78 S.Ct. 1280, 2 L.Ed.2d 1405 (1958). Moreover, \"precise calibration of crime and punishment\" is not part of the constitutional regimen. <i>Saccoccia,</i> 58 F.3d at 787. \"The inherent nature of our federal system\" necessarily produces \"a wide range of constitutional sentences.\" <i>Solem,</i> 463 U.S. at 291 n. 17, 103 S.Ct. 3001.</p>\n<p>Given the deference that courts owe to legislative judgments in the area of crime <span class=\"star-pagination\">*77</span> and punishment, it is predictable that most efforts to demonstrate gross disproportionality will fail. The case law bears out that verity. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Frisby,</i> 258 F.3d 46, 50 (1st Cir.2001) (holding 151-month sentence for heroin distribution based on \"career criminal\" status not grossly disproportionate); <i>Cardoza,</i> 129 F.3d at 18 (holding 235-month sentence under Armed Career Criminal Act for possession of ammunition not grossly disproportionate); <i>United States v. Graciani,</i> 61 F.3d 70, 76 (1st Cir.1995) (holding 280-month sentence for distribution of crack cocaine not grossly disproportionate).</p>\n<p>Here, the defendant's challenge falters at the first step of the pavane: he has failed to show that his sentence is grossly disproportionate on its face to the crime of conviction. We explain briefly.</p>\n<p>The offense of conviction is the attempted production of child pornography. As new means of communication have proliferated, child pornography has become a mounting societal problem. Consequently, Congress has expended a great deal of time, energy, and effort fine-tuning the penalties associated with the production of child pornography. Over the last three decades, it has mandated increasingly severe sanctions for that crime (whether consummated or attempted).</p>\n<p>That has involved a progression from a maximum penalty of ten years in 1978, to a maximum of twenty years in 1996, to a maximum of thirty years in 2003. By the same token, Congress has progressed from no minimum penalty in 1978, to a minimum of ten years in 1996, to a minimum of fifteen years in 2003. <i>See</i> Protection of Children Against Sexual Exploitation Act of 1977, Pub.L. No. 95-225, 92 Stat. 7, 7; Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009, 3009-30; Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to end the Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003 (PROTECT Act), Pub.L. No. 108-21, 117 Stat. 650, 653. This continuing escalation was based on a grim set of congressional findings to the effect that the \"prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse of children constitutes a government objective of surpassing importance, and this interest extends to stamping out the vice of child pornography at all levels in the distribution chain.\" PROTECT Act, 117 Stat. at 676 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Congress has found such severe penalties necessary because child pornography is a \"multimillion dollar industry\" run by a \"nationwide network of individuals\" who \"openly advertis[e] their desire to exploit children and to traffic in child pornography.\" Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006, Pub.L. No. 109-248, 120 Stat. 587, 623.</p>\n<p>The defendant makes three counter-arguments. First, he trivializes the gravity of the offense of conviction. His brief reads as if there were no real distinction between, say, passing a bad check or owning child pornography, on the one hand, and attempting to violate a child by inducing her to participate in producing new pornography, on the other hand. But this effort to debunk the gravity of the offense is tantamount to whistling past the graveyard: despite the defendant's disdain, the offense of conviction is a serious crime.</p>\n<p>In Congress's viewand that is the view that matters mostthe production of child pornography is a profoundly serious matter. That is a reasonable value judgment, well within Congress's prerogative to make. <i>Saccoccia,</i> 58 F.3d at 789. Therefore, Congress was entitled to punish the offense heavily.</p>\n<p>The defendant next argues that his crime was merely an attempt, not a fully consummated offense. That argument <span class=\"star-pagination\">*78</span> does not take him very far. Federal law historically has punished attempts on a par with the underlying substantive offenses. <i>See, e.g.,</i> 18 U.S.C. § 2423(e) (governing attempts to violate the Mann Act); 8 U.S.C. § 1324(1)(A) (governing attempts to violate the immigration laws). In all events, we are unable to discern anything amiss in Congress's desire to treat attempted crimes as analogous to completed crimes for purposes of punishment.</p>\n<p>In our judgment, the absence of such a distinction has little, if any, bearing on the accused's culpability. By the same token, it has little, if any, bearing on the constitutionality of the resultant sentence. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Brown,</i> 500 F.3d 48, 60 (1st Cir.2007) (accepting the validity in a sentencing scheme of a congressional mandate \"to treat inchoate offenses with as much gravity as the substantive offenses that underlie them\"); <i>cf. </i><i>Hutto v. Davis,</i> 454 U.S. 370, 374, 102 S.Ct. 703, 70 L.Ed.2d 556 (1982) (holding that imposition of a harsh sentence for possession of marijuana based on intent to distribute does not offend the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause of the Eighth Amendment).</p>\n<p>The bottom line is simply this: Congress has made a reasonable legislative determination that a criminal who attempts to produce child pornography is as deserving of a stiff sentence as a criminal who actually succeeds in producing such smut. There is no principled way that the Eighth Amendment permits us to second-guess that legislative judgment.</p>\n<p>The last potential line of defense devolves from the fact that this case did not involve an actual child but, rather, an impersonator (an undercover police officer). Here, however, the defendant has not claimed entrapment or police misconduct of any sort, and the government's use of undercover operatives as a tool to combat crime is well within the pale. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Brand,</i> 467 F.3d 179, 181-82 (2d Cir.2006); <i>United States v. Santana,</i> 6 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1993). Perhaps more important, the jury supportably found that the defendant believed his correspondent to be a thirteen-year-old girl and intended to extract sexually explicit photographs from her. Given the jury's verdict, the defendant cannot be heard to complain that his mistake of fact absolves him of criminal responsibility. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Dixon,</i> 449 F.3d 194, 202 (1st Cir.2006); <i>United States v. Cotts,</i> 14 F.3d 300, 307 (7th Cir.1994). On the same reasoning, we think that his mistake of fact cannot tip the Eighth Amendment balance in his favor.</p>\n<p>Because we find no gross disproportionality between the fifteen-year mandatory minimum term of imprisonment established by 18 U.S.C. § 2251(e) and the offense of which the defendant stands convicted, we need go no further. The defendant's Eighth Amendment challenge fails.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n</div>",

McGaughey, Appellate Chief, on brief for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before Lynch, Chief Judge, SELYA and HOWARD, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>SELYA, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>This appeal requires us to decide whether the fifteen-year mandatory minimum term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. § 2251(e), as applied, violates the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. For the reasons explained below, we conclude that it does <span class=\"star-pagination\">*75</span> not. Consequently, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p>The background facts can be succinctly summarized. The jury supportably could have found that defendant-appellant Byron Polk, over the course of some four months, engaged in online conversations with a person whom he presumed to be a thirteen-year-old girl. He pressured her to take and send to him sexually explicit photographs of herself.</p>\n<p>The thirteen-year-old girl turned out to be an undercover police officer and, in due course, a federal grand jury indicted the defendant for attempting to produce child pornography. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 2251(a), (e). The evidence showed that, during the period when the online chats occurred, the defendant was physically afflicted and confined to a wheelchair. At trial, he characterized his offense as an isolated and harmless consequence of his disability and ensuing confinement. However, other evidence suggested that, at the time of these conversations, the defendant was engaging in sexually explicit discussions, in person or online, with three other underage girls.</p>\n<p>The trial jury convicted the defendant of the charged offense. The presentence investigation report told a seamy story: it revealed an earlier conviction for aggravated sexual assault on a toddler, sexual involvement with teenage girls on at least two occasions, and yet another series of sexually charged computer chats with a minor. The defendant conceded these facts but objected to the statutory fifteen-year mandatory minimum sentence that he faced as cruel and unusual.</p>\n<p>The district court found that the defendant had not accepted responsibility. <i>See</i> USSG § 3E1.1. It set his total offense level at 36 and placed him in criminal history category I. These determinations all of which are conceded on appealyielded a guideline sentencing range (GSR) of 188 to 235 months in prison.</p>\n<p>The maximum penalty under the statute of conviction was thirty years and the mandatory minimum sentence was fifteen years. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 2251(e). The district court rejected the defendant's constitutional challenge, finding both the GSR and the prescribed mandatory minimum appropriate. The court proceeded to sentence the defendant to an incarcerative term of fifteen years, eight months. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p>The customary appellate benchmark for measuring a sentence imposed by a district court is reasonableness. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Booker,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span>, 260-61, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The case law bears out that verity. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Frisby,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774128\"><a href=\"/opinion/774128/united-states-v-norman-e-frisby/\"><span class=\"volume\">258</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 50 (1st Cir.2001) (holding 151-month sentence for heroin distribution based on \"career criminal\" status not grossly disproportionate); <i>Cardoza,</i> 129 F.3d at 18 (holding 235-month sentence under Armed Career Criminal Act for possession of ammunition not grossly disproportionate); <i>United States v. Graciani,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196199\"><a href=\"/opinion/196199/united-states-v-graciani/\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span>, 76 (1st Cir.1995) (holding 280-month sentence for distribution of crack cocaine not grossly disproportionate).</p>\n<p>Here, the defendant's challenge falters at the first step of the pavane: he has failed to show that his sentence is grossly disproportionate on its face to the crime of conviction. We explain briefly.</p>\n<p>The offense of conviction is the attempted production of child pornography. As new means of communication have proliferated, child pornography has become a mounting societal problem. Consequently, Congress has expended a great deal of time, energy, and effort fine-tuning the penalties associated with the production of child pornography. Over the last three decades, it has mandated increasingly severe sanctions for that crime (whether consummated or attempted).</p>\n<p>That has involved a progression from a maximum penalty of ten years in 1978, to a maximum of twenty years in 1996, to a maximum of thirty years in 2003. By the same token, Congress has progressed from no minimum penalty in 1978, to a minimum of ten years in 1996, to a minimum of fifteen years in 2003. <i>See</i> Protection of Children Against Sexual Exploitation Act of 1977, Pub.L. No. 95-225, 92 Stat. 7, 7; Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009, 3009-30; Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to end the Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003 (PROTECT Act), Pub.L. No. 108-21, 117 Stat. 650, 653. This continuing escalation was based on a grim set of congressional findings to the effect that the \"prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse of children constitutes a government objective of surpassing importance, and this interest extends to stamping out the vice of child pornography at all levels in the distribution chain.\" PROTECT Act, 117 Stat. at 676 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Congress has found such severe penalties necessary because child pornography is a \"multimillion dollar industry\" run by a \"nationwide network of individuals\" who \"openly advertis[e] their desire to exploit children and to traffic in child pornography.\" Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006, Pub.L. No. 109-248, 120 Stat. 587, 623.</p>\n<p>The defendant makes three counter-arguments. First, he trivializes the gravity of the offense of conviction. His brief reads as if there were no real distinction between, say, passing a bad check or owning child pornography, on the one hand, and attempting to violate a child by inducing her to participate in producing new pornography, on the other hand. But this effort to debunk the gravity of the offense is tantamount to whistling past the graveyard: despite the defendant's disdain, the offense of conviction is a serious crime.</p>\n<p>In Congress's viewand that is the view that matters mostthe production of child pornography is a profoundly serious matter. That is a reasonable value judgment, well within Congress's prerogative to make. <i>Saccoccia,</i> 58 F.3d at 789. Therefore, Congress was entitled to punish the offense heavily.</p>\n<p>The defendant next argues that his crime was merely an attempt, not a fully consummated offense. That argument <span class=\"star-pagination\">*78</span> does not take him very far. Federal law historically has punished attempts on a par with the underlying substantive offenses. <i>See, e.g.,</i> 18 U.S.C. § 2423(e) (governing attempts to violate the Mann Act); 8 U.S.C. § 1324(1)(A) (governing attempts to violate the immigration laws). In all events, we are unable to discern anything amiss in Congress's desire to treat attempted crimes as analogous to completed crimes for purposes of punishment.</p>\n<p>In our judgment, the absence of such a distinction has little, if any, bearing on the accused's culpability. By the same token, it has little, if any, bearing on the constitutionality of the resultant sentence. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Brown,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202905\"><a href=\"/opinion/202905/united-states-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></a></span>, 60 (1st Cir.2007) (accepting the validity in a sentencing scheme of a congressional mandate \"to treat inchoate offenses with as much gravity as the substantive offenses that underlie them\"); <i>cf. </i><i>Hutto v. Davis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110594\"><a href=\"/opinion/110594/hutto-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">370</span></a></span>, 374, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110594\"><a href=\"/opinion/110594/hutto-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">703</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110594\"><a href=\"/opinion/110594/hutto-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">556</span></a></span> (1982) (holding that imposition of a harsh sentence for possession of marijuana based on intent to distribute does not offend the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause of the Eighth Amendment).</p>\n<p>The bottom line is simply this: Congress has made a reasonable legislative determination that a criminal who attempts to produce child pornography is as deserving of a stiff sentence as a criminal who actually succeeds in producing such smut. There is no principled way that the Eighth Amendment permits us to second-guess that legislative judgment.</p>\n<p>The last potential line of defense devolves from the fact that this case did not involve an actual child but, rather, an impersonator (an undercover police officer). Here, however, the defendant has not claimed entrapment or police misconduct of any sort, and the government's use of undercover operatives as a tool to combat crime is well within the pale. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Brand,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">179</span></span>, 181-82 (2d Cir.2006); <i>United States v. Santana,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"654192\"><a href=\"/opinion/654192/united-states-v-rafael-santana-and-francis-fuentes/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.1993). Perhaps more important, the jury supportably found that the defendant believed his correspondent to be a thirteen-year-old girl and intended to extract sexually explicit photographs from her. Given the jury's verdict, the defendant cannot be heard to complain that his mistake of fact absolves him of criminal responsibility. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Dixon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202231\"><a href=\"/opinion/202231/united-states-v-dixon/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></a></span>, 202 (1st Cir.2006); <i>United States v. Cotts,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"660692\"><a href=\"/opinion/660692/united-states-v-fundador-cotts-victor-fernandez-and-carlos-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">300</span></a></span>, 307 (7th Cir.1994). On the same reasoning, we think that his mistake of fact cannot tip the Eighth Amendment balance in his favor.</p>\n<p>Because we find no gross disproportionality between the fifteen-year mandatory minimum term of imprisonment established by 18 U.S.C. § 2251(e) and the offense of which the defendant stands convicted, we need go no further. The defendant's Eighth Amendment challenge fails.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n</div>",
