Pro se petitioner Anthony Sansone petitions\n\nfor review of the decision of the Railroad Retirement Board (Board)\n\nfinding that he is not disabled and is not, therefore, entitled to\n\na disability annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act, 45 U.S.C.\n\n§   231a(a)(1)(v).    For   the   reasons   explained   below,   we   deny\n\npetitioner's petition.\n\n            In his petition for judicial review and brief, petitioner\n\ndoes not identify any specific errors of fact or law in the Board's\n\ndecision.    Nevertheless, we have reviewed the certified record in\n\ndetail in order to determine whether substantial evidence exists to\n\nsupport the hearing officer's findings, and to ensure that there is\n\nno error of law.1    45 U.S.C. § 355(f).      Substantial evidence is\n\n\"such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as\n\nadequate to support a conclusion.\" Richardson v. Perales, 402 U.S.\n\n389, 399 (1971) (quoting Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB. 305 U.S.\n\n197, 229 (1938)).\n\n            Substantial evidence supports the hearings officer's\n\ndetermination that petitioner's impairments do not render him\n\nunable to engage in any regular employment within the meaning of 45\n\nU.S.C. § 231a(a)(1)(v), and that he retains the residual functional\n\ncapacity to perform sedentary clerical work. Petitioner's treating\n\n\n      1\n          Because the Board affirmed and adopted the hearings\nofficer's decision, on appeal we evaluate the judgment of the\nhearings officer. Dray v. Railroad Retirement Board, 10 F.3d 1206,\n1210 (7th Cir. 1993) (unpublished table decision) (citing Hayes v.\nRailroad Retirement Board, 966 F.2d 298, 302 (7th Cir. 1992)).\n\n                                   -2-\n\fphysicians assessed his limitations in different and conflicting\n\nways, one doctor finding petitioner totally impaired from walking\n\nand standing and able to sit for only 1 to 2 hours at a time, for\n\nexample, while two others found no such limitations.         The most\n\ndetailed and comprehensive assessment in the record, including the\n\nonly residual functional capacity assessment, was provided by the\n\nBoard's examining physician, who determined that petitioner could\n\nsit six hours out of an eight hour day, and perform the tasks\n\nassociated with sedentary work.    Conflicts in the medical evidence\n\nare to be resolved by the hearings officer, not this Court on\n\nreview. Bowman v. Railroad Retirement Board, 952 F.2d 207, 211 (8th\n\nCir. 1991).\n\n          The hearings officer's determination also is supported by\n\npetitioner's   own   testimony.     Petitioner   testified   that   he\n\nexperiences fatigue and does not move as quickly as he used to, but\n\nhe gets up every day, has his coffee and reads, takes public\n\ntransportation to the coffee shop to visit with friends, visits\n\nwith his family, watches some television and videos, and assists\n\nwith household chores such as vacuuming and washing pots and pans.\n\nPetitioner also testified that he takes a walk every other day and\n\nworks out with three-pound dumbbells, and that he manages his\n\ndiabetes with oral medication and treats his occasional pain with\n\nover-the-counter painkillers.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f          At the hearing, the vocational expert was impressed not\n\njust with petitioner's work experience, but also with his attitude.\n\nHe offered his opinion, credited by the hearings officer, that\n\npetitioner is an \"impressive candidate with an advantage over a\n\ntypical 62 year-old in the labor market.\"   Record at 11.   Because\n\nwe find no error of law and conclude that \"a reasonable mind,\n\nreviewing the evidence in the record as a whole, could accept it as\n\nadequate to support\" the hearing's officer's conclusion, Rodriguez\n\nv. Sec'y of Health & Human Services, 647 F.2d 218, 222 (1st Cir.\n\n1981), we deny the petition for review.\n\n\n\n\n                               -4-\n\f",
