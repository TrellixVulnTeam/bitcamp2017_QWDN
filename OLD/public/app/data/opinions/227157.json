In his answer he alleged that The Cheshire Inn Corporation was indebted to him for wages covering a substantial period of time approximating two years and that any action taken by The Cheshire Inn Corporation in surrendering said licenses was taken in consideration of the corporation's indebtedness to him.  He denied that at the first meeting of the creditors of the bankrupt he admitted the transfer of said licenses to him was without consideration and that he agreed to transfer said licenses to the bankrupt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court entered judgment on September 29, 1950, wherein it stated in part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'It appearing that the pleadings clearly disclose a situation where action should be taken summarily, it is thereupon, on the Court's own motion,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Ordered, that summary judgment be entered for the plaintiff, and that the defendant transfer or surrender, through whatever means are lawful, all his right, title and interest in the innholder's license and the alcoholic beverage license, to the trustee of the bankrupt estate.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 2, 1950, the district court filed 'Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law' in which it stated in part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'1. The transfer of the All Alcoholic license and Inn Holders' license made by the bankrupt to the defendant on January 30, 1950 was a preferential transfer within the meaning of Section 60 of the Bankruptcy Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'2. This Court has jurisdiction under Section 23 of said Bankruptcy Act to order the defendant to transfer or surrender, through whatever means are lawful, all his right, title and interest in said licenses, to the trustee of the bankrupt estate.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court has jurisdiction under the Bankruptcy Act.  Schumacher v. Beeler, 293 U.S. 367, 55 S.Ct. 230, 79 L.Ed. 433; Collier on Bankruptcy (14th Ed.), Vol. 2, Sec. 23.15, p. 571 et seq.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court heard no testimony and the pleadings do not support its conclusion that the transfer of said licenses by the bankrupt to Landy on January 30, 1950, was a preferential transfer within the meaning of Sec. 60 of the Bankruptcy Act.  In re Mason, D.C., 49 F.Supp. 781; Haas v. Sachs, 8 Cir., 68 F.2d 623, Mansfield Lumber Co. v. Sternberg, 8 Cir., 38 F.2d 615; Collier on Bankruptcy (14th Ed.) Vol. 3, Secs. 60.34-60.35, pp. 865-874.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Among other things, the pleadings raise a genuine issue as to whether or not Landy received a greater percentage of his debt than some other creditor of the same class.  The presence of such an issue precludes summary judgment.  Rule 56, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A.  See Sprague v. Vogt, 8 Cir., 150 F.2d 795.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is our opinion that Landy is entitled to a hearing on the issues raised in the pleadings.  The court in the Sprague case, supra, said, 150 F.2d at page 801: ' * * * That one reasonably may surmise that the plaintiff is unlikely to prevail upon a trial, is not a sufficient basis for refusing him his day in court with respect to issues which are not shown to be sham, frivolous, or so unsubstantial that it would obviously be futile to try them.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Paragraph 10 of the complaint is concerned with the fraudulent transfer of the assets of the bankrupt for the sole benefit of Landy in derogation of the rights of the creditors of the bankrupt.  Landy denies this allegation.  This matter may be inquired into at the hearing on the merits, especially with reference to Sec. 70, sub. e of the Bankruptcy Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Landy's contention that the licenses here are not property is unrealistic.  It was held in Fisher v. Cushman, 1 Cir., 103 F. 860, 51 L.R.A. 292, that a liquor license is 'property' within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Act.  See note to Fisher v. Cushman, 43 C.C.A. 381, 390.  See Collier on Bankruptcy (14th Ed.).  Vol. 4, Sec. 70.22, p. 1107.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If, upon the hearing of this case on the merits, the district court should find that the transfer of the licences was fraudulent or preferential, the substance of the order contained in the judgment entered September 29, 1950, would appear to be proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion; the appellant recovers on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
