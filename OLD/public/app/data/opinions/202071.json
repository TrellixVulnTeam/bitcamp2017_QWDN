Gustavo A.

This appeal presents a veritable thicket of\n\npost-judgment motions for relief.           At best, only the district\n\ncourt's   denial   of    appellant's    third   and   fourth     motions   for\n\nreconsideration are properly before us for review, and with respect\n\nto these two orders we conclude that the district court did not\n\nabuse its discretion.      We set forth an abbreviated history so as to\n\nexplain why only these two motions, at most, are open to appellate\n\nreview.\n\n           On July 1, 2004, the district court entered summary\n\njudgment for appellees Alberto Gonzales, Attorney General, and the\n\nUnited States Department of Justice, dismissing this employment\n\ndiscrimination case involving the United States Marshals Service\n\n(USMS) in Puerto Rico.        Within ten days of the entry of final\n\njudgment for appellees, appellant Jose L. Diaz (who has acted pro\n\nse throughout this litigation) filed his first post-judgment motion\n\nfor relief.   The district court properly considered Diaz's motion\n\na motion for reconsideration under Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 59(e), which\n\nstayed the operation of the appeals clock until such time as the\n\ncourt ruled on it.      Fed. R. App. Pro. 4(a)(4)(A); Aybar v. Crispin-\n\nReyes, 118 F.3d 10, 14 (1st Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1078\n\n(1998).\n\n           The   district    court     denied   Diaz's   first    motion   for\n\nreconsideration on July 23, 2004, and the docket reports the case\n\nclosed again on July 27, 2004.       Diaz did not appeal.        Instead, ten\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fdays later, Diaz filed his second post-judgment motion, titled\n\nsimply \"supplemental motion.\"          Because this second motion sought\n\nthe same relief (reversal of the summary judgment decision and\n\nentry of judgment for Diaz) on essentially the same grounds as the\n\nfirst       post-judgment    motion,   the     district     court      apparently\n\nconsidered it a second Rule 59(e) motion for reconsideration.\n\nBecause the motion was filed more than ten days after entry of\n\nfinal judgment, however, it was more properly considered as arising\n\nunder Rule 60(b).\n\n              In response to Diaz's second motion, the court ordered\n\nappellees to file a certification regarding the existence of\n\nvacancies in the USMS in Puerto Rico in the years immediately\n\nfollowing Diaz's application for employment.              Diaz did not respond\n\nto the certification.         Approximately two weeks later, the court\n\ndenied Diaz's motion.        Again Diaz did not appeal.\n\n              Almost three months passed without activity in the case.\n\nDiaz then filed his third post-judgment motion. In this motion for\n\nreconsideration,      Diaz    asserted       that   he   had   never     received\n\nappellees' certification or the court's order denying his second\n\nmotion and he had, therefore, been denied the opportunity to file\n\nhis objections prior to the court's ruling.1                The court ordered\n\nappellees to respond to Diaz's arguments and requested additional\n\n\n        1\n        In each of his post-judgment motions, Diaz also argued that\nthe court's summary judgment ruling should be reversed and judgment\nshould be entered for him.\n\n                                       -3-\n\fbriefing by both parties on the question of whether the court had\n\njurisdiction to consider the motion and whether a party who does\n\nnot subscribe to the electronic filing system has a duty to check\n\nthe docket.     After receiving the parties' pleadings, the court\n\ndenied Diaz's third motion, stating, among other things, that\n\nDiaz's arguments were \"legally insufficient\" to reopen this case\n\n\"in which judgment has become final.\"      Again, Diaz did not appeal.\n\n           Within ten days of entry of the court's order denying his\n\nthird motion for reconsideration, Diaz filed his fourth and final\n\nmotion for reconsideration, seeking the same relief on virtually\n\nthe same grounds as his previous motion.         The court denied this\n\nmotion.   Sixty days after entry of this ruling, and nearly ten\n\nmonths after the court entered summary judgment for the appellees,\n\nDiaz filed his first and only notice of appeal.\n\n           It is well-settled that \"[w]hile the timely service of a\n\nmotion for reconsideration will toll the time in which an aggrieved\n\nlitigant must file a notice of appeal, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e),\n\nan   untimely   motion   for   reconsideration   will   not.\"   Acevedo-\n\nVillalobos, 22 F.3d at 389 (quoting Feinstein v. Moses, 951 F.2d\n\n16, 18 (1st Cir. 1991) (collecting cases)).      A post-judgment motion\n\nfiled more than ten days after the entry of final judgment does not\n\ntoll the running of the time for filing an appeal.              Aybar v.\n\nCrispin-Reyes, 118 F.3d at 14.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f              At best, the only rulings timely appealed and properly\n\nbefore us, therefore, are the district court's denial of Diaz's\n\nthird and fourth motions for reconsideration.2               We have reviewed\n\nthe record and find no abuse of discretion in the court's denial of\n\nboth motions.\n\n              The district court carefully considered Diaz's third\n\nmotion for reconsideration.      It ordered additional briefing on the\n\nmerits   of    Diaz's   claim   that    he   should   have    been   given   an\n\nopportunity to reply to appellees' certification.              It ordered the\n\nparties to address the issue of whether the court had jurisdiction\n\nto consider the motion. After receiving those pleadings, the court\n\nordered further briefing on yet another issue: whether a party who\n\ndoes not subscribe to the court's electronic filing system (as Diaz\n\napparently did not) has a duty to check the court's docket.             It was\n\nonly after considering all of these issues that the court denied\n\nthe third motion for reconsideration.\n\n              \"We have made it transparently clear that relief under\n\nRule 60(b) is 'extraordinary in nature\"' and that \"motions invoking\n\n\n\n     2\n        Because the third motion was filed several months after\nentry of final judgment, we will assume without deciding that it\narose under Rule 60(b). We will also assume without deciding that\nthe fourth motion for reconsideration, filed within ten days of the\ncourt's denial of Diaz's third motion for reconsideration, arose\nunder Rule 59(e) and tolled the time for appealing from the denial\nof the third. We have frequently stated that regardless of what\nthe motion is labeled, \"we review the district court's disposition\nof it for abuse of discretion.\" Cintron-Lorenzo v. Departmento de\nAsuntos del Consumidor, 312 F.3d 522, 527 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n                                       -5-\n\fthe rule should be granted sparingly.\" Moreover, \"[i]n considering\n\nsuch a motion, we recognize the district court's 'intimate, first-\n\nhand knowledge of the case,' and, thus, defer broadly to that\n\ncourt's informed discretion.\"     Cintron-Lorenzo v. Departmento de\n\nAsuntos del Consumidor, 312 F.3d. 522, 527 (1st Cir. 2002) (quoting\n\nKarak v. Bursaw Oil Corp., 288 F.3d 15, 19 (1st Cir. 2002)).        In his\n\nthird motion for reconsideration, Diaz failed to show that he was\n\nentitled to extraordinary relief.       When Diaz's fourth motion for\n\nreconsideration    simply   restated    the   arguments   already   fully\n\nconsidered and rejected by the court in its previous ruling, there\n\nwas no abuse of discretion in issuing a summary denial.\n\n          Insofar as Diaz's appeal seeks to challenge the July 1,\n\n2004 entry of summary judgment dismissing the case or the denial of\n\nhis first two motions for reconsideration, it is dismissed for want\n\nof appellate jurisdiction.       The orders of the district court\n\ndenying Diaz's third and fourth motions for reconsideration are\n\nhereby affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\f",
