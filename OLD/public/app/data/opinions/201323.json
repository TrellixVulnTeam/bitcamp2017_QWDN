X. STOKES,\n\n                       Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n\n           APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                 FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n          [Hon. Richard G. Stearns, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                    Torruella, Dyk,* and Howard,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Judith H. Mizner, for appellant.\n     Cynthia A. Young, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                         November 5, 2004\n\n\n\n\n*\n    Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f             TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.            A jury convicted defendant-\n\nappellant Ronald Stokes of being a felon in possession of a\n\nfirearm.     See 18 U.S.C. § 922(g).     The district court sentenced him\n\nto 360 months imprisonment -- of which 283 months were to be served\n\nconcurrently with a state sentence he had already begun serving --\n\nand 60 months of supervised release. Stokes argues three issues on\n\nappeal: (1) the district court erred by excluding proffered expert\n\ntestimony regarding eyewitness identification; (2) the district\n\ncourt erred by imposing a sentence in excess of 25 years; and (3)\n\npursuant to Blakely v. Washington, 124 S. Ct. 2531 (2004), his\n\nsentence     violated   the    Sixth   Amendment      of   the   United   States\n\nConstitution.\n\n             After   careful   review,       we   affirm   the   conviction   and\n\nsentence.\n\n                               I.   Background\n\nA.   Facts\n\n             The factual foundation of this case has been thoroughly\n\nexplained elsewhere. See United States v. Stokes, 124 F.3d 39, 41-\n\n43 (1st Cir. 1997); United States v. Stokes, 947 F. Supp. 546, 548-\n\n50 (D. Mass. 1996); Commonwealth v. Stokes, 653 N.E.2d 180, 181-85\n\n(Mass. App. Ct. 1995), rev. denied, 655 N.E.2d 1277 (Mass. 1995).\n\nThe facts, as they pertain to this appeal, are briefly described\n\nbelow.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\f           In the early morning of December 6, 1990, an altercation\n\noccurred   at   7   Don   Street.   The   altercation   began   when   José\n\nCandelaria a/k/a Miguelín, a resident of 318 Fuller Street, began\n\nsmashing the windows of the cars in front of 7 Don Street.\n\nCandelaria also broke the front window of the 7 Don Street home.\n\nCandelaria ultimately pushed his way into the 7 Don Street house\n\nafter Linda Stokes, one of the house's occupants, went to speak\n\nwith Candelaria.     According to Linda Stokes, Candelaria had a long\n\ngun.    Eventually, Candelaria left 7 Don Street, firing several\n\nshots as he drove away.      The Boston police arrived at 3:25 a.m. to\n\ninvestigate the disturbance. After the police left, Ronald Stokes,\n\nwho also lived at 7 Don Street, arrived home and was informed of\n\nthe altercation.\n\n           Around 4:00 a.m. an incident occurred on Fuller Street,\n\nthe street where Candelaria lived. Kenneth Pounds, a Fuller Street\n\nresident, was leaving his house at 323 Fuller Street on his way to\n\nwork.   While walking to his car, Mr. Pounds noticed two men in\n\nfront of a vacant house.      Suspicious, Mr. Pounds turned to go back\n\ninside his home at which point he heard: \"Let's get him.\"          Before\n\nPounds could close the door he heard gunshots.          Both Pounds, and\n\nhis wife Bettie, who had been standing in the doorway, were shot.\n\nAnother individual, Kenneth Wiggins, was shot in the back and died\n\nin his automobile in Fuller Street.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f           At the time of this shooting, Boston Police Department\n\nDetective Michael Cox and Officer Craig Jones were traveling in the\n\narea of Fuller Street in an unmarked police car.      Cox and Jones\n\ndrove down Fuller Street, with their lights off, after being\n\ninformed of the gunshots.   They noticed two black men, one shorter\n\nthan the other, leaning on a car near 310 Fuller Street.    The two\n\nmen looked as though they were fiddling with something.        Upon\n\nseeing the cruiser, the two men ran.   Officer Cox jumped out of the\n\ncruiser and broadcasted that he was in pursuit of a suspect with a\n\ngun.\n\n           The chase proceeded down an alleyway where the shorter\n\nman slipped on a patch of ice, fell to one knee, and dropped what\n\nCox claimed was a firearm.      The shorter man reached back to\n\nretrieve the item as Officer Cox, who was still in pursuit, came to\n\nwithin five to eight feet of the shorter man.    At some point, Cox\n\nlost the shorter man in a dark alley.     Cox did, however, hear a\n\nfence rattling.\n\n           Armed with a flashlight, Jones continued looking for the\n\ntwo men.   Hearing a fence rattle, Jones shined his flashlight in\n\nthe direction of 310 Fuller Street.    Upon doing so, Jones saw the\n\nshorter man pulling his foot out of a fence.     While pursuing the\n\nshorter man, Jones noticed an AK-47 five feet from the fence where\n\nthe shorter man's foot had been stuck.\n\n\n\n\n                                -4-\n\f           In the meantime, Cox met another police cruiser being\n\ndriven by Officer Painten.        Cox told Painten that the suspect was\n\n\"a black male, short, bald-headed.\"         A few minutes later, Painten\n\nsaw and detained a man fitting that description.                The man was\n\nsweating profusely.    Cox and Jones drove to where the suspect was\n\nbeing   detained.     Cox   and   Jones    confirmed    that   the   detained\n\nindividual was the shorter man who possessed a gun while trying to\n\nrun away from them.    The shorter man was identified as defendant-\n\nappellant Ronald Stokes.      The slug found in Wiggins's body, the\n\nslugs found inside the Pounds's home, and an empty shell casing\n\nfound outside the Pounds's home, were all fired from the AK-47 that\n\nOfficer Jones had found five feet from where he had seen Stokes\n\nstuck in the fence.\n\n                             II.    Analysis\n\nA.   Excluding expert testimony\n\n           The central issue at trial was whether Ronald Stokes was\n\nthe person who possessed the firearm.        The bulk of the testimony on\n\nwhether   Stokes    possessed       the    gun   came    from    eyewitness\n\nidentification by Officers Cox and Jones. To counter the testimony\n\nof Cox and Jones, Stokes indicated that Dr. Alexander Daniel Yarmey\n\nwould testify as an expert regarding the validity of eyewitness\n\ntestimony.   On January 13, 1999, the district court instructed\n\nStokes to file a memorandum of law explaining why Dr. Yarmey's\n\ntestimony should be admitted.         On February 25, 1999, four days\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fbefore   trial   and    without    having    received   Stokes's    memorandum\n\nregarding expert testimony, the district court issued a memorandum\n\nexcluding Dr. Yarmey's testimony.\n\n            The district court excluded the proposed expert testimony\n\nbecause, \"[a]s a general proposition, the psychological factors\n\nthat affect the reliability of eyewitness identification are a\n\nmatter of common experience,\" and the admission of such testimony\n\ninvades the province of the jury.           Memorandum and Order Regarding\n\nExpert Eyewitness Identification Testimony 1 (Feb. 25, 1999).                 The\n\ndistrict    court   recognized     that     such   testimony   is   helpful   in\n\n\"special\" circumstances, but failed to find that such circumstances\n\nexisted in this case.        Thus, the district court ruled that the\n\ntestimony was inadmissable \"both for its tendency to encroach on\n\nthe jury's function and because of its lack of bearing on any\n\nmaterial issue.\"       Id. at 3.\n\n             The following day, Stokes filed a summary of Dr. Yarmey's\n\ntestimony.     The summary indicated that Dr. Yarmey would testify\n\nconcerning \"the scientific evidence regarding psychological factors\n\nwhich are involved in acquisition, retention and retrieval of\n\ninformation in situations similar to the circumstances in this\n\ncase.\"     The only other information the summary contained was that\n\nDr. Yarmey sought to testify specifically regarding:\n\n            [t]he effect of \"weapon focus\" with respect to\n            an eyewitness's ability to perceive; [t]he\n            effect of feeling afraid or upset at the time\n            an eyewitness perceives a perpetrator; [t]he\n\n                                      -6-\n\f           distortions of time perception common to\n           eyewitnesses; [t]he influence of expectations\n           on the ability to identify a perpetrator;\n           [t]he effect of suggestiveness post incident;\n           [t]ransference of innocent encounters; [and]\n           the relationship between an eyewitness's\n           confidence and his/her identification and its\n           accuracy.\n\nStokes did not request reconsideration of the district court's\n\norder excluding Dr. Yarmey's testimony.\n\n           \"[W]e review a trial court's decision to admit or exclude\n\nexpert testimony under an abuse of discretion standard.\"         United\n\nStates v. Díaz, 300 F.3d 66, 74 (1st Cir. 2002).             Under this\n\nstandard, we have given a district court's decision to admit or\n\nexclude evidence great deference.        See United States v. Corey, 207\n\nF.3d 84, 88 (1st Cir. 2000); United States v. Shay, 57 F.3d 126,\n\n132 (1st Cir. 1995).     For the reasons stated below, we believe that\n\nthe district court did not abuse its discretion by excluding the\n\ntestimony of Dr. Yarmey.\n\n           Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence governs the\n\nadmissibility of expert testimony and \"provides that a proposed\n\nexpert witness must be sufficiently qualified to assist the trier\n\nof fact, and that his or her expert testimony must be relevant to\n\nthe task at hand and rest on a reliable basis.\"       Díaz, 300 F.3d at\n\n73.   The rule states:\n\n           If scientific, technical, or other specialized\n           knowledge will assist the trier of fact to\n           understand the evidence or to determine a fact\n           in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by\n           knowledge, skill, experience, training, or\n\n                                   -7-\n\f              education, may testify thereto in the form of\n              an opinion or otherwise, if (1) the testimony\n              is based upon sufficient facts or data, (2)\n              the testimony is the product of reliable\n              principles and methods, and (3) the witness\n              has applied the principles and methods\n              reliably to the facts of the case.\n\nFed. R. Evid. 702.         By screening proffered expert testimony for\n\nboth reliability and relevance, the district court performs an\n\nimportant gatekeeping role.              See Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm.,\n\nInc., 509 U.S. 579, 592-95 (1993).                  In this case, the district\n\ncourt exercised its gatekeeping role by excluding Dr. Yarmey's\n\ntestimony.\n\n              Expert testimony \"must be relevant not only in the sense\n\nthat    all   evidence    must     be    relevant     .   .    .   but   also   in   the\n\nincremental sense that the expert's proposed opinion, if admitted,\n\nlikely would assist the trier of fact to understand or determine a\n\nfact in issue.\"        Ruiz-Troche v. Pepsi Cola of Puerto Rico Bottling\n\nCo., 161 F.3d 77, 81 (1st Cir. 1998) (citations omitted).                       Expert\n\ntestimony on eyewitness identification presents an interesting\n\nquestion       for     admissibility          purposes         because     eyewitness\n\nidentification involves a \"credibility determination within the ken\n\nof     the    ordinary     judge        and   juror       --    unlike,    say,      DNA\n\nidentification.\"         United States v. Brien, 59 F.3d 274, 276 (1st\n\nCir. 1995).          Fed. R. Evid. 702 permits expert testimony that\n\n\"assist[s] the trier of fact,\" and it is possible that \"an expert\n\nsuch as a psychologist familiar with identification problems could\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fgive the jury background information about the mechanism of memory,\n\ntypes of errors, error rates, and other information not commonly\n\npossessed by the jury -- information that may even be at odds with\n\nwhat a judge or juror might expect.\"           Id. at 276-77.\n\n            As we have previously stated, \"[w]e are unwilling to\n\nadopt a blanket rule that qualified expert testimony on eyewitness\n\nidentification must routinely be admitted or excluded.\"                   Id. at\n\n277. Rather, we, and the district courts, should examine each case\n\none by one, taking into account such concerns as \"the reliability\n\nand helpfulness of the proposed expert testimony, the importance\n\nand the quality of the eyewitness evidence it addresses, and any\n\nthreat of confusion, misleading of the jury, or unnecessary delay.\"\n\nId.\n\n            When the district court ruled to exclude Dr. Yarmey's\n\ntestimony, the record did not address the foundation for his\n\ntestimony    or   how    his   testimony    would     aid   a   jury.1      See,\n\ne.g., Brien, 59 F.3d at 277 (finding no abuse of discretion when\n\ndefense failed     to    adequately   respond    to   request    for     data   or\n\nliterature    underlying       an   expert's    testimony       on   eyewitness\n\nidentification).        Providing the district court with information\n\nunderlying the expert's assumptions and conclusions allows the\n\ncourt to \"gauge whether the testimony would be helpful to the jury\n\n\n\n1\n  The Defendant's Summary of Expert Testimony also did not contain\nthis information.\n\n                                      -9-\n\for would confuse or mislead instead.\"   Id.   Without such guidance,\n\nthe district court turned to the caselaw and concluded that expert\n\ntestimony regarding eyewitness identification aids a jury where\n\nspecial circumstances exist, such as\n\n          where an identification is made after a long\n          delay or under conditions of extreme stress,\n          see, e.g., United States v. Harris, 995 F.2d\n          532, 535 (4th Cir. 1993), or where a witness's\n          faculties were impaired at the time of the\n          identification, see, e.g., State v. Whaley,\n          406 S.E.2d 369, 372 (S.C. 1991), or where no\n          independent    evidence    corroborates    the\n          defendant's guilt. . . .\n\nMemorandum and Order Regarding Eyewitness Identification Testimony,\n\nat 2.\n\n          Without any information regarding the reliability and\n\nhelpfulness of the proposed expert testimony and without any\n\nindication of the existence of a special circumstance, the district\n\ncourt could not conclude that the proposed expert testimony would\n\n\"assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence.\"       Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 702.   Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion\n\nwhen it excluded the expert's testimony.\n\nB.   Sentencing\n\n          Stokes was convicted of being a felon in possession of a\n\nfirearm and ammunition in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g).       The\n\npenalty for violating § 922(g) is a fine, a term of imprisonment\n\nnot to exceed ten years, or both.   18 U.S.C. § 924(a)(2).   Stokes,\n\nhowever, was sentenced to thirty years imprisonment pursuant to the\n\n\n                               -10-\n\fArmed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\"), 18 U.S.C. § 924(e).                 Stokes\n\nclaims the district court committed plain error by concluding that\n\nthe maximum penalty for violating the ACCA was life imprisonment\n\nbecause, he claims, the correct maximum penalty is supplied by 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3559, which lists a Class C felony as having a maximum\n\npenalty of twenty-five years imprisonment.           We disagree.\n\n           Before proceeding into the analysis, it is prudent to\n\nclarify   Stokes's    argument   by     analyzing    the    four     statutory\n\nprovisions involved.      The first provision, 18 U.S.C. § 922(g),\n\nmakes it unlawful for a felon to possess a firearm.                 The second\n\nprovision, 18 U.S.C. § 924(a)(2), provides that a knowing violation\n\nof § 922(g) shall result in imprisonment for not more than ten\n\nyears.    The third provision, the ACCA, 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1),\n\nprovides that a person convicted of violating § 922(g) who has\n\nthree previous convictions referred to in the statute shall be\n\nsentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than fifteen years.\n\nThe ACCA does not supply a maximum term of imprisonment.                   The\n\nfourth provision, 18 U.S.C. § 3559(a)(3), classifies an offense as\n\na Class C felony if the maximum term of imprisonment is \"less than\n\ntwenty-five years but ten or more years.\"\n\n           Stokes    claims   that   since   the    ACCA   is   a   sentencing\n\nenhancement statute, it does not create a new offense to be\n\ncategorized under § 3559.      Thus, applying § 922(g) -- the statute\n\nunder which Stokes was convicted -- to § 3559, results in Stokes's\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fconviction being labeled a Class C felony, which has a maximum term\n\nof imprisonment of less than twenty-five years.   Stokes therefore\n\nargues that the district court plainly erred in sentencing him to\n\nthirty years.\n\n          Stokes's argument fails for two reasons.     First, this\n\ncourt has previously stated that the maximum penalty for those who\n\nfall within the ACCA is life imprisonment.    See United States v.\n\nWeems, 322 F.3d 18, 26 (1st Cir. 2003) (stating that the maximum\n\nsentence under the ACCA is life imprisonment); see also Custis v.\n\nUnited States, 511 U.S. 485, 487 (1994) (stating that the ACCA\n\n\"raises the penalty for possession of a firearm by a felon . . . to\n\na mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years and a maximum of life in\n\nprison without parole\"); United States v. Mack, 229 F.3d 226, 229\n\nn.4 (3d Cir. 2000) (stating that the ACCA \"specifies no maximum\n\nterm of imprisonment [but] has been construed to authorize a life\n\nterm\"); United States v. Brame, 997 F.2d 1426, 1428 (11th Cir.\n\n1993) (same); United States v. Guerrero, 5 F.3d 868, 874 n.12 (5th\n\nCir. 1993) (same); United States v. Wolack, 923 F.2d 1193, 1199\n\n(6th Cir. 1991) (same); United States v. Carey, 898 F.2d 642, 644\n\n(8th Cir. 1990) (same); United States v. Blannon, 836 F.2d 843, 845\n\n(4th Cir. 1988) (same).   Stokes urges us to overturn this well-\n\nestablished precedent, but we decline to do so.\n\n          Second, Stokes's argument suffers from a misreading of\n\n§ 3559(a).   Section 3559(a) classifies \"[a]n offense that is not\n\n\n                               -12-\n\fspecifically classified by a letter grade in the section defining\n\nit.\"     18 U.S.C. § 3559(a).         The statute does not purport to limit\n\nthe maximum term of imprisonment based upon how an offense is\n\nclassified.       We therefore conclude that the district court did not\n\nplainly err in sentencing Stokes to thirty years imprisonment since\n\nsuch a sentence is between the statutory minimum of fifteen years\n\nand the maximum of life imprisonment.\n\nC.     Blakely\n\n             After sentencing and opening brief on appeal, Stokes\n\nfiled    a   supplemental      brief   seeking     additional     review   of    his\n\nsentencing in light of the Supreme Court's recent decision in\n\nBlakely, 124 S. Ct. 2531 (2004).                Our precedent forecloses this\n\nissue.\n\n             In Blakely, the Supreme Court held that a state judge’s\n\nsentence enhancement beyond the prescribed statutory maximum, based\n\non     the   judge's   own     finding    that    the     defendant   acted     with\n\n\"deliberate cruelty,\" violated the defendant's Sixth Amendment\n\nright to a jury trial.         Id. at 2536-43.      This is because the facts\n\nsupporting the sentence were neither admitted by the defendant nor\n\nfound by a jury.       Id. at 2537.\n\n              Although Blakely expressed no opinion on the Federal\n\nSentencing       Guidelines,    see    id.   at   2538,    n.9   (\"[t]he   Federal\n\nGuidelines are not before us, and we express no opinion on them\"),\n\nStokes argues that his sentencing implicates Blakely in two ways.\n\n\n                                         -13-\n\fFirst, the district court determined Stokes's base level to be 34,\n\nrather than 33, because the \"evidence is overwhelming that he used\n\nan AK-47 during the commission of a crime of violence.\"                    United\n\nStates v. Stokes, No. CRIM. 95-10379-RGS, 2000 WL 246478, at *4 (D.\n\nMass. Feb. 28, 2000).      The jury, however, never found that Stokes\n\nused the weapon during a crime of violence.           The difference in base\n\nlevel between 33 and 34 changes the applicable guideline range from\n\n235-293   months    to   262-327    months     imprisonment.      Second,    the\n\ndistrict court granted an upward departure from 34 to 35 --\n\nchanging the applicable guideline range from 262-327 months to 292-\n\n365 months imprisonment -- because of the extraordinarily dangerous\n\nnature of the particular weapon and ammunition.              The gun was an AK-\n\n47, with 7.62 x 39mm caliber ammunition.              The jury did not find\n\nthat the gun used was an AK-47, nor did it find that such a gun is\n\nextraordinarily dangerous. Stokes argues that pursuant to Blakely,\n\nthese factual findings are impermissible because they were not\n\ndetermined by a jury or admitted by Stokes.\n\n             Stokes, however, never raised the Blakely issue in the\n\ndistrict court or in his opening brief on appeal.              Thus, we review\n\nthe district court's enhancement of Stokes's sentence for plain\n\nerror.    United States v. Savarese, __ F.3d __, 2004 WL 2106341, at\n\n*5 (1st Cir. Sept. 22, 2004).       See also United States v. Morgan, __\n\nF.3d   __,   2004   WL   1949061,    at   *5   (1st   Cir.    Sept.   2,   2004)\n\n(questioning whether plain error was even available, or whether the\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fissue was waived entirely, when a Blakely issue was neither raised\n\nbelow nor initially in this court).\n\n               Plain error is an extremely deferential standard; errors\n\nwill be corrected only if \"(1) . . . an error occurred (2) which\n\nwas    clear    or     obvious   and   which     not    only   (3)   affected   [his]\n\nsubstantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness,\n\nintegrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"                         Id.\n\n(quoting United States v. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir. 2001)).\n\nIn applying the plain error standard after Blakely, we have held\n\nthat    no     plain    error    occurs   where        the   facts   underlying   the\n\nenhancement were undisputed.                  Savarese, 2004 WL 2106341 at *6\n\n(holding that a defendant who did not dispute the factual basis\n\nunderlying the sentence enhancement forecloses a finding of plain\n\nerror).\n\n               We have also noted, and now emphasize, that any \"error in\n\nsentencing should be held harmless so long as the evidence for the\n\ntrial judge's factual findings is overwhelming and no reasonable\n\njury could have disagreed with them.\"                  Morgan, 2004 WL 1949061 at\n\n*5 (citing Sustache-Rivera v. United States, 221 F.3d 8, 18-19 (1st\n\nCir. 2000)).         That is, if the evidence overwhelmingly proves the\n\nfactual basis underlying the sentence enhancement, we will find no\n\nplain error for the judge's failure to submit the facts to a jury.\n\nWe    simply    fail     to   see   how   a    judicial      finding   for   sentence\n\nenhancement, explicitly sanctioned by the Sentencing Guidelines,\n\n\n                                          -15-\n\fand overwhelmingly proved at trial, would seriously affect the\n\nfairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\n\nSee Johnson v. United States, 520 U.S. 461, 470 (1997)(holding that\n\nthe district court's failure to submit the issue of materiality to\n\nthe jury was not an error that seriously affected the fairness,\n\nintegrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings because the\n\nevidence supporting materiality was overwhelming and essentially\n\nuncontroverted at trial).\n\n            Here, the judge's findings -- that Stokes used an AK-47\n\nduring a crime of violence, and that such a gun is extraordinarily\n\ndangerous   --   were   \"overwhelmingly\"   proven,   and   therefore   not\n\nplainly erroneous.      Evidence establish that during hot pursuit,\n\nOfficer Jones noticed an AK-47 five feet from where the \"shorter\n\nman's\" foot had been stuck, that the shorter man was Stokes, and\n\nthat the pursuit stemmed from the shooting of three individuals,\n\none of whom died,2 with slugs from the AK-47.        Moreover, the jury\n\n-- in convicting Stokes -- necessarily had to find that Stokes\n\npossessed the same AK-47 charged in the indictment,3 discussed in\n\n\n2\n    Stokes had disputed the \"facts of [Wiggins's] murder\" for\nsentence enhancement. Stokes was acquitted for the first-degree\nmurder of Wiggins in state court. The district court explicitly\nstated that it would not consider Wiggins's murder for sentence\nenhancement: \"a finding of responsibility for second degree murder\nwould have no impact on Stokes's ultimate sentence.\" Stokes, 2000\nWL 246478, at * 4.\n3\n   The indictment charged Stokes with possessing a \"firearm, to\nwit: a Polytechnologies, AK-47, Model 47/S, 7/62 x 39 mm. caliber,\nsemi-automatic rifle, bearing serial number P4705703, and\n\n                                  -16-\n\fthe testimony, and offered into evidence.                   Since the evidence\n\noverwhelmingly proved that Stokes possessed and used a weapon (an\n\nAK-47) and ammunition (7.62 caliber) in connection with a crime of\n\nviolence (the shooting of Kenneth and Bettie Pounds), the court's\n\nfailure to submit this issue to the jury was not plainly erroneous;\n\nit did not seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public\n\nreputation of judicial proceedings.\n\n             Likewise, the district court did not plainly err in\n\nfinding      that   the     particular      AK-47     and     ammunition     were\n\n\"extraordinarily dangerous.\"             In determining the extent of an\n\nupward departure for a \"weapon or dangerous instrumentality,\" the\n\nSentencing     Guidelines    state   that     a     court   may   consider    the\n\ndangerousness of the weapon, the manner in which it is used (such\n\nas whether it was discharged), and the extent to which its use\n\nendangered others.        U.S.S.G. § 5K2.6.         Here, evidence establish\n\nthat the weapon was a semiautomatic AK-47 with a high capacity,\n\nthat the bullets fired at the Pounds's home and into the street\n\ncame from this particular AK-47, and that the AK-47 was discharged\n\nat   least   thirteen     times   that    evening.      The    government    also\n\npresented testimony -- considered by the jury in convicting Stokes\n\n-- that the AK-47 is a high-powered rifle used by the military and\n\nterrorists, and that the armor-piercing bullets were large and\n\npowerful.     Given the overwhelming evidence supporting the AK-47's\n\n\nammunition, to wit: rounds of 7.62 x 39 mm. caliber ammunition.\"\n\n                                     -17-\n\fdangerousness, we simply fail to see how the court plainly erred in\n\nfinding this fact to enhance Stokes's sentence.\n\n          Although the future of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines\n\nremains uncertain, see United States v. Booker, 375 F.3d 508 (7th\n\nCir. 2004), cert. granted, 73 U.S.L.W. 3073, 3074, 542 U.S. ___\n\n(Aug. 2, 2004)(No. 04-104); United States v.

Moreover, even if Blakely is held to apply to the\n\nFederal Guidelines, we find no basis for reversal for the reasons\n\nstated above.   We therefore hold that the court did not plainly err\n\nin enhancing Stokes's sentence.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -18-\n\f",

Stokes,</i> 124 F.3d 39, 41-43 (1st Cir.1997); <i>United States v. Stokes,</i> 947 F.Supp. 546, 548-50 (D.Mass.1996); <i>Commonwealth v.

The facts, as they pertain to this appeal, are briefly described below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the early morning of December 6, 1990, an altercation occurred at 7 Don Street. The altercation began when Jos&#233; Candelaria a/k/a Miguel&#237;n, a resident of 318 Fuller Street, began smashing the windows of the cars in front of 7 Don Street. Candelaria also broke the front window of the 7 Don Street home. Candelaria ultimately pushed his way into the 7 Don Street house after Linda Stokes, one of the house's occupants, went to speak with Candelaria. According to Linda Stokes, Candelaria had a long gun. Eventually, Candelaria left 7 Don Street, firing several shots as he drove away. The Boston police arrived at 3:25 a.m. to investigate the disturbance. After the police left, Ronald Stokes, who also lived at 7 Don Street, arrived home and was informed of the altercation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Around 4:00 a.m. an incident occurred on Fuller Street, the street where Candelaria lived. Kenneth Pounds, a Fuller Street resident, was leaving his house at 323 Fuller Street on his way to work. While walking to his car, Mr. Pounds noticed two men in front of a vacant house. Suspicious, Mr. Pounds turned to go back inside his home at which point he heard: \"Let's get him.\" Before Pounds could close the door he heard gunshots. Both Pounds, and his wife Bettie, who had been standing in the doorway, were shot. Another individual, Kenneth Wiggins, was shot in the back and died in his automobile in Fuller Street.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of this shooting, Boston Police Department Detective Michael Cox and Officer Craig Jones were traveling in the area of Fuller Street in an unmarked police car. Cox and Jones drove down Fuller Street, with their lights off, after being informed of the gunshots. They noticed two black men, one shorter than the other, leaning on a car near 310 Fuller Street. The two men looked as though they were fiddling with something. Upon seeing the cruiser, the two men ran. Officer Cox jumped out of the cruiser and broadcasted that he was in pursuit of a suspect with a gun.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The chase proceeded down an alleyway where the shorter man slipped on a patch of ice, fell to one knee, and dropped what Cox claimed was a firearm. The shorter man reached back to retrieve the item as Officer Cox, who was still in pursuit, came to within five to eight feet of the shorter man. At some point, Cox lost the shorter man in a dark alley. Cox did, however, hear a fence rattling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Armed with a flashlight, Jones continued looking for the two men. Hearing a fence rattle, Jones shined his flashlight in the direction of 310 Fuller Street. Upon doing so, Jones saw the shorter man pulling his foot out of a fence. While pursuing the shorter man, Jones noticed an AK-47 five feet from the fence where the shorter man's foot had been stuck.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the meantime, Cox met another police cruiser being driven by Officer Painten. Cox told Painten that the suspect was \"a black male, short, bald-headed.\" A few minutes later, Painten saw and detained a man fitting that description. The man was sweating profusely. Cox and Jones drove to where the suspect was being detained. Cox and Jones confirmed that the detained individual was the shorter man who possessed a gun while trying to run away from them. The shorter man was identified as defendant-appellant Ronald Stokes. The slug found in Wiggins's body, the slugs found inside the Pounds's home, and an empty shell casing found outside the Pounds's home, were all fired from the AK-47 that Officer Jones had found five feet from where he had seen Stokes stuck in the fence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Analysis</i></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Excluding expert testimony</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The central issue at trial was whether Ronald Stokes was the person who possessed the firearm. The bulk of the testimony on whether Stokes possessed the gun came from eyewitness identification by Officers Cox and Jones. To counter the testimony of Cox and Jones, Stokes indicated that Dr. Alexander Daniel Yarmey would testify as an expert regarding the validity of eyewitness testimony. On January 13, 1999, the district court instructed Stokes to file a memorandum of law explaining why Dr. Yarmey's testimony should be admitted. On February 25, 1999, four days before trial and without having received Stokes's memorandum regarding expert testimony, the district court issued a memorandum excluding Dr. Yarmey's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court excluded the proposed expert testimony because, \"[a]s a general proposition, the psychological factors that affect the reliability of eyewitness identification are a matter of common experience,\" and the admission of such testimony invades the province of the jury. Memorandum and Order Regarding Expert Eyewitness Identification Testimony 1 (Feb. 25, 1999). The district court recognized that such testimony is helpful in \"special\" circumstances, but failed to find that such circumstances existed in this case. Thus, the district court ruled that the testimony was inadmissible \"both for its tendency to encroach on the jury's function and because of its lack of bearing on any material issue.\" <i>Id.</i> at 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following day, Stokes filed a summary of Dr. Yarmey's testimony. The summary indicated that Dr. Yarmey would testify concerning \"the scientific evidence regarding psychological factors which are involved in acquisition, retention and retrieval of information in situations similar to the circumstances in this case.\" The only other information the summary contained was that Dr. Yarmey sought to testify specifically regarding:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[t]he effect of \"weapon focus\" with respect to an eyewitness's ability to perceive; [t]he effect of feeling afraid or upset at the time an eyewitness perceives a perpetrator; [t]he distortions of time perception common to eyewitnesses; [t]he influence of expectations on the ability to identify a perpetrator; [t]he effect of suggestiveness post incident; [t]ransference of innocent encounters; [and] the relationship between an eyewitness's confidence and his/her identification and its accuracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stokes did not request reconsideration of the district court's order excluding Dr. Yarmey's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[W]e review a trial court's decision to admit or exclude expert testimony under an abuse of discretion standard.\" <i>United States v.

Whaley,</i> 305 S.C. 138, 406 S.E.2d 369, 372 (1991), or where no independent evidence corroborates the defendant's guilt....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Memorandum and Order Regarding Eyewitness Identification Testimony, at 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without any information regarding the reliability and helpfulness of the proposed expert testimony and without any indication of the existence of a special circumstance, the district court could not conclude that the proposed expert testimony would \"assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence.\" Fed.R.Evid. 702. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it excluded the expert's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Sentencing</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stokes was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g). The penalty for violating &#167; 922(g) is a fine, a term of imprisonment not to exceed ten years, or both. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(a)(2). Stokes, however, was sentenced to thirty years imprisonment pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\"), 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e). Stokes claims the district court committed plain error by concluding that the maximum penalty for violating the ACCA was life imprisonment because, he claims, the correct maximum penalty is supplied by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3559, which lists a Class C felony as having a maximum penalty of twenty-five years imprisonment. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before proceeding into the analysis, it is prudent to clarify Stokes's argument by analyzing the four statutory provisions involved. The first provision, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g), makes it unlawful for a felon to possess a firearm. The second provision, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(a)(2), provides that a knowing violation of &#167; 922(g) shall result in imprisonment for <i>not more than</i> ten years. The third provision, the ACCA, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(1), provides that a person convicted of violating &#167; 922(g) who has three previous convictions referred to in the statute shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of <i>not less than</i> fifteen years. The ACCA does not supply a maximum term of imprisonment. The fourth provision, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3559(a)(3), classifies an offense as a Class C felony if the maximum term of imprisonment is \"less than twenty-five years but ten or more years.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stokes claims that since the ACCA is a sentencing enhancement statute, it does not create a new offense to be categorized under &#167; 3559. Thus, applying &#167; 922(g)&#8212; the statute under which Stokes was convicted&#8212;to &#167; 3559, results in Stokes's conviction being labeled a Class C felony, which has a maximum term of imprisonment of less than twenty-five years. Stokes therefore argues that the district court plainly erred in sentencing him to thirty years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stokes's argument fails for two reasons. First, this court has previously stated that the maximum penalty for those who fall within the ACCA is life imprisonment. <i>See United States v. Weems,</i> 322 F.3d 18, 26 (1st Cir.2003) (stating that the maximum sentence under the ACCA is life imprisonment); <i>see also Custis v. United States,</i> 511 U.S. 485, 487, 114 S.Ct. 1732, 128 L.Ed.2d 517 (1994) (stating that the ACCA \"raises the penalty for possession of a firearm by a felon ... to a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years and a maximum of life in prison without parole\"); <i>United States v. Mack,</i> 229 F.3d 226, 229 n. 4 (3d Cir.2000) (stating that the ACCA \"specifies no maximum term of imprisonment [but] has been construed to authorize a life term\"); <i>United States v. Brame,</i> 997 F.2d 1426, 1428 (11th Cir.1993) (same); <i>United States v. Guerrero,</i> 5 F.3d 868, 874 n. 12 (5th Cir.1993) (same); <i>United States v. Wolak,</i> 923 F.2d 1193, 1199 (6th Cir. 1991) (same); <i>United States v. Carey,</i> 898 F.2d 642, 644 (8th Cir.1990) (same); <i>United States v. Blannon,</i> 836 F.2d 843, 845 (4th Cir.1988) (same). Stokes urges us to overturn this well-established precedent, but we decline to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Stokes's argument suffers from a misreading of &#167; 3559(a). Section 3559(a) classifies \"[a]n offense that is not specifically classified by a letter grade in the section defining it.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3559(a). The statute does not purport to limit the maximum term of imprisonment based upon how an offense is classified. We therefore conclude that the district court did not plainly err in sentencing Stokes to thirty years imprisonment since such a sentence is between the statutory minimum of fifteen years and the maximum of life imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Blakely</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After sentencing and opening brief on appeal, Stokes filed a supplemental brief seeking additional review of his sentencing in light of the Supreme Court's recent decision in <i>Blakely,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Our precedent forecloses this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Blakely,</i> the Supreme Court held that a state judge's sentence enhancement beyond the prescribed statutory maximum, based on the judge's own finding that the defendant acted with \"deliberate cruelty,\" violated the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. <i>Id.</i> at 2536-43. This is because the facts supporting the sentence were neither admitted by the defendant nor found by a jury. <i>Id.</i> at 2537.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although <i>Blakely</i> expressed no opinion on the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, <i>see id.</i> at 2538, n. 9 (\"[t]he Federal Guidelines are not before us, and we express no opinion on them\"), Stokes argues that his sentencing implicates <i>Blakely</i> in two ways. First, the district court determined Stokes's base level to be 34, rather than 33, because the \"evidence is overwhelming that he used an AK-47 during the commission of a crime of violence.\" <i>United States v. Stokes,</i> No. CRIM. 95-10379-RGS, 2000 WL 246478, at *4 (D.Mass. Feb.28, 2000). The jury, however, never found that Stokes used the weapon during a crime of violence. The difference in base level between 33 and 34 changes the applicable guideline range from 235-293 months to 262-327 months imprisonment. Second, the district court granted an upward departure from 34 to 35&#8212;changing the applicable guideline range from 262-327 months to 292-365 months imprisonment&#8212;because of the extraordinarily dangerous nature of the particular weapon and ammunition. The gun was an AK-47, with 7.62 &#215; 39mm caliber ammunition. The jury did not find that the gun used was an AK-47, nor did it find that such a gun is extraordinarily dangerous. Stokes argues that pursuant to <i>Blakely,</i> these factual findings are impermissible because they were not determined by a jury or admitted by Stokes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stokes, however, never raised the <i>Blakely</i> issue in the district court or in his opening brief on appeal. Thus, we review the district court's enhancement of Stokes's sentence for plain error. <i>United States v. Savarese,</i> 385 F.3d 15, 21 (1st Cir.2004). <i>See also United States v. Morgan,</i> 384 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2004) (questioning whether plain error was even available, or whether the issue was waived entirely, when a <i>Blakely</i> issue was neither raised below nor initially in this court).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plain error is an extremely deferential standard; errors will be corrected only if \"(1) ... an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected [his] substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>United States v. Duarte,</i> 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.2001)). In applying the plain error standard after <i>Blakely,</i> we have held that no plain error occurs where the facts underlying the enhancement were undisputed. <i>Savarese,</i> 385 F.3d at 22 (holding that a defendant who did not dispute the factual basis underlying the sentence enhancement forecloses a finding of plain error).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have also noted, and now emphasize, that any \"error in sentencing should be held harmless so long as the evidence for the trial judge's factual findings is overwhelming and no reasonable jury could have disagreed with them.\" <i>Morgan,</i> 384 F.3d at 8 (citing <i>Sustache-Rivera v. United States,</i> 221 F.3d 8, 18-19 (1st Cir.2000)). That is, if the evidence overwhelmingly proves the factual basis underlying the sentence enhancement, we will find no plain error for the judge's failure to submit the facts to a jury. We simply fail to see how a judicial finding for sentence enhancement, explicitly sanctioned by the Sentencing Guidelines, and overwhelmingly proved at trial, would seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <i>See Johnson v. United States,</i> 520 U.S. 461, 470, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997)(holding that the district court's failure to submit the issue of materiality to the jury was not an error that seriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings because the evidence supporting materiality was overwhelming and essentially uncontroverted at trial).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the judge's findings&#8212;that Stokes used an AK-47 during a crime of violence, and that such a gun is extraordinarily dangerous&#8212;were \"overwhelmingly\" proven, and therefore not plainly erroneous. Evidence establish that during hot pursuit, Officer Jones noticed an AK-47 five feet from where the \"shorter man's\" foot had been stuck, that the shorter man was Stokes, and that the pursuit stemmed from the shooting of three individuals, one of whom died,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> with slugs from the AK-47. Moreover, the jury&#8212;in convicting Stokes&#8212;necessarily had to find that Stokes possessed the same AK-47 charged in the indictment,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> discussed in the testimony, and offered into evidence. Since the evidence overwhelmingly proved that Stokes possessed and used a weapon (an AK-47) and ammunition (7.62 caliber) in connection with a crime of violence (the shooting of Kenneth and Bettie Pounds), the court's failure to submit this issue to the jury was not plainly erroneous; it did not seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Likewise, the district court did not plainly err in finding that the particular AK-47 and ammunition were \"extraordinarily dangerous.\" In determining the extent of an upward departure for a \"weapon or dangerous instrumentality,\" the Sentencing Guidelines state that a court may consider the dangerousness of the weapon, the manner in which it is used (such as whether it was discharged), and the extent to which its use endangered others. U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.6. Here, evidence establish that the weapon was a semiautomatic AK-47 with a high capacity, that the bullets fired at the Pounds's home and into the street came from this particular AK-47, and that the AK-47 was discharged at least thirteen times that evening. The government also presented testimony&#8212;considered by the jury in convicting Stokes&#8212;that the AK-47 is a high-powered rifle used by the military and terrorists, and that the armorpiercing bullets were large and powerful. Given the overwhelming evidence supporting the AK-47's dangerousness, we simply fail to see how the court plainly erred in finding this fact to enhance Stokes's sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the future of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines remains uncertain, <i>see United States v. Booker,</i> 375 F.3d 508 (7th Cir.2004), <i>cert. granted,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 125 S.Ct. 11, ___ L.Ed2d ___ (2004); <i>Fanfan v.

Moreover, even if <i>Blakely</i> is held to apply to the Federal Guidelines, we find no basis for reversal for the reasons stated above. We therefore hold that the court did not plainly err in enhancing Stokes's sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Defendant's Summary of Expert Testimony also did not contain this information</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Stokes had disputed the \"facts of [Wiggins's] murder\" for sentence enhancement.

The altercation began when Jos&#233; Candelaria a/k/a Miguel&#237;n, a resident of 318 Fuller Street, began smashing the windows of the cars in front of 7 Don Street. Candelaria also broke the front window of the 7 Don Street home. Candelaria ultimately pushed his way into the 7 Don Street house after Linda Stokes, one of the house's occupants, went to speak with Candelaria. According to Linda Stokes, Candelaria had a long gun. Eventually, Candelaria left 7 Don Street, firing several shots as he drove away. The Boston police arrived at 3:25 a.m. to investigate the disturbance. After the police left, Ronald Stokes, who also lived at 7 Don Street, arrived home and was informed of the altercation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Around 4:00 a.m. an incident occurred on Fuller Street, the street where Candelaria lived. Kenneth Pounds, a Fuller Street resident, was leaving his house at 323 Fuller Street on his way to work. While walking to his car, Mr. Pounds noticed two men in front of a vacant house. Suspicious, Mr. Pounds turned to go back inside his home at which point he heard: \"Let's get him.\" Before Pounds could close the door he heard gunshots. Both Pounds, and his wife Bettie, who had been standing in the doorway, were shot. Another individual, Kenneth Wiggins, was shot in the back and died in his automobile in Fuller Street.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of this shooting, Boston Police Department Detective Michael Cox and Officer Craig Jones were traveling in the area of Fuller Street in an unmarked police car. Cox and Jones drove down Fuller Street, with their lights off, after being informed of the gunshots. They noticed two black men, one shorter than the other, leaning on a car near 310 Fuller Street. The two men looked as though they were fiddling with something. Upon seeing the cruiser, the two men ran. Officer Cox jumped out of the cruiser and broadcasted that he was in pursuit of a suspect with a gun.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The chase proceeded down an alleyway where the shorter man slipped on a patch of ice, fell to one knee, and dropped what Cox claimed was a firearm. The shorter man reached back to retrieve the item as Officer Cox, who was still in pursuit, came to within five to eight feet of the shorter man. At some point, Cox lost the shorter man in a dark alley. Cox did, however, hear a fence rattling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Armed with a flashlight, Jones continued looking for the two men. Hearing a fence rattle, Jones shined his flashlight in the direction of 310 Fuller Street. Upon doing so, Jones saw the shorter man pulling his foot out of a fence. While pursuing the shorter man, Jones noticed an AK-47 five feet from the fence where the shorter man's foot had been stuck.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the meantime, Cox met another police cruiser being driven by Officer Painten. Cox told Painten that the suspect was \"a black male, short, bald-headed.\" A few minutes later, Painten saw and detained a man fitting that description. The man was sweating profusely. Cox and Jones drove to where the suspect was being detained. Cox and Jones confirmed that the detained individual was the shorter man who possessed a gun while trying to run away from them. The shorter man was identified as defendant-appellant Ronald Stokes. The slug found in Wiggins's body, the slugs found inside the Pounds's home, and an empty shell casing found outside the Pounds's home, were all fired from the AK-47 that Officer Jones had found five feet from where he had seen Stokes stuck in the fence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Analysis</i></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Excluding expert testimony</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The central issue at trial was whether Ronald Stokes was the person who possessed the firearm. The bulk of the testimony on whether Stokes possessed the gun came from eyewitness identification by Officers Cox and Jones. To counter the testimony of Cox and Jones, Stokes indicated that Dr. Alexander Daniel Yarmey would testify as an expert regarding the validity of eyewitness testimony. On January 13, 1999, the district court instructed Stokes to file a memorandum of law explaining why Dr. Yarmey's testimony should be admitted. On February 25, 1999, four days before trial and without having received Stokes's memorandum regarding expert testimony, the district court issued a memorandum excluding Dr. Yarmey's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court excluded the proposed expert testimony because, \"[a]s a general proposition, the psychological factors that affect the reliability of eyewitness identification are a matter of common experience,\" and the admission of such testimony invades the province of the jury. Memorandum and Order Regarding Expert Eyewitness Identification Testimony 1 (Feb. 25, 1999). The district court recognized that such testimony is helpful in \"special\" circumstances, but failed to find that such circumstances existed in this case.

The penalty for violating &#167; 922(g) is a fine, a term of imprisonment not to exceed ten years, or both. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(a)(2). Stokes, however, was sentenced to thirty years imprisonment pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\"), 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e). Stokes claims the district court committed plain error by concluding that the maximum penalty for violating the ACCA was life imprisonment because, he claims, the correct maximum penalty is supplied by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3559, which lists a Class C felony as having a maximum penalty of twenty-five years imprisonment. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before proceeding into the analysis, it is prudent to clarify Stokes's argument by analyzing the four statutory provisions involved. The first provision, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g), makes it unlawful for a felon to possess a firearm. The second provision, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(a)(2), provides that a knowing violation of &#167; 922(g) shall result in imprisonment for <i>not more than</i> ten years. The third provision, the ACCA, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(1), provides that a person convicted of violating &#167; 922(g) who has three previous convictions referred to in the statute shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of <i>not less than</i> fifteen years. The ACCA does not supply a maximum term of imprisonment. The fourth provision, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3559(a)(3), classifies an offense as a Class C felony if the maximum term of imprisonment is \"less than twenty-five years but ten or more years.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stokes claims that since the ACCA is a sentencing enhancement statute, it does not create a new offense to be categorized under &#167; 3559. Thus, applying &#167; 922(g)&#8212; the statute under which Stokes was convicted&#8212;to &#167; 3559, results in Stokes's conviction being labeled a Class C felony, which has a maximum term of imprisonment of less than twenty-five years. Stokes therefore argues that the district court plainly erred in sentencing him to thirty years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stokes's argument fails for two reasons. First, this court has previously stated that the maximum penalty for those who fall within the ACCA is life imprisonment. <i>See United States v.

Stokes urges us to overturn this well-established precedent, but we decline to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Stokes's argument suffers from a misreading of &#167; 3559(a). Section 3559(a) classifies \"[a]n offense that is not specifically classified by a letter grade in the section defining it.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3559(a). The statute does not purport to limit the maximum term of imprisonment based upon how an offense is classified. We therefore conclude that the district court did not plainly err in sentencing Stokes to thirty years imprisonment since such a sentence is between the statutory minimum of fifteen years and the maximum of life imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Blakely</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After sentencing and opening brief on appeal, Stokes filed a supplemental brief seeking additional review of his sentencing in light of the Supreme Court's recent decision in <i>Blakely,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136995\"><a href=\"/opinion/136995/blakely-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Our precedent forecloses this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Blakely,</i> the Supreme Court held that a state judge's sentence enhancement beyond the prescribed statutory maximum, based on the judge's own finding that the defendant acted with \"deliberate cruelty,\" violated the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. <i>Id.</i> at 2536-43. This is because the facts supporting the sentence were neither admitted by the defendant nor found by a jury. <i>Id.</i> at 2537.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although <i>Blakely</i> expressed no opinion on the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, <i>see id.</i> at 2538, n. 9 (\"[t]he Federal Guidelines are not before us, and we express no opinion on them\"), Stokes argues that his sentencing implicates <i>Blakely</i> in two ways. First, the district court determined Stokes's base level to be 34, rather than 33, because the \"evidence is overwhelming that he used an AK-47 during the commission of a crime of violence.\" <i>United States v. Stokes,</i> No. CRIM. 95-10379-RGS, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">246478</span></span>, at *4 (D.Mass. Feb.28, 2000). The jury, however, never found that Stokes used the weapon during a crime of violence. The difference in base level between 33 and 34 changes the applicable guideline range from 235-293 months to 262-327 months imprisonment. Second, the district court granted an upward departure from 34 to 35&#8212;changing the applicable guideline range from 262-327 months to 292-365 months imprisonment&#8212;because of the extraordinarily dangerous nature of the particular weapon and ammunition. The gun was an AK-47, with 7.62 &#215; 39mm caliber ammunition. The jury did not find that the gun used was an AK-47, nor did it find that such a gun is extraordinarily dangerous. Stokes argues that pursuant to <i>Blakely,</i> these factual findings are impermissible because they were not determined by a jury or admitted by Stokes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stokes, however, never raised the <i>Blakely</i> issue in the district court or in his opening brief on appeal.

In applying the plain error standard after <i>Blakely,</i> we have held that no plain error occurs where the facts underlying the enhancement were undisputed. <i>Savarese,</i> 385 F.3d at 22 (holding that a defendant who did not dispute the factual basis underlying the sentence enhancement forecloses a finding of plain error).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have also noted, and now emphasize, that any \"error in sentencing should be held harmless so long as the evidence for the trial judge's factual findings is overwhelming and no reasonable jury could have disagreed with them.\" <i>Morgan,</i> 384 F.3d at 8 (citing <i>Sustache-Rivera v.

That is, if the evidence overwhelmingly proves the factual basis underlying the sentence enhancement, we will find no plain error for the judge's failure to submit the facts to a jury. We simply fail to see how a judicial finding for sentence enhancement, explicitly sanctioned by the Sentencing Guidelines, and overwhelmingly proved at trial, would seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <i>See Johnson v.

Evidence establish that during hot pursuit, Officer Jones noticed an AK-47 five feet from where the \"shorter man's\" foot had been stuck, that the shorter man was Stokes, and that the pursuit stemmed from the shooting of three individuals, one of whom died,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> with slugs from the AK-47. Moreover, the jury&#8212;in convicting Stokes&#8212;necessarily had to find that Stokes possessed the same AK-47 charged in the indictment,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> discussed in the testimony, and offered into evidence. Since the evidence overwhelmingly proved that Stokes possessed and used a weapon (an AK-47) and ammunition (7.62 caliber) in connection with a crime of violence (the shooting of Kenneth and Bettie Pounds), the court's failure to submit this issue to the jury was not plainly erroneous; it did not seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Likewise, the district court did not plainly err in finding that the particular AK-47 and ammunition were \"extraordinarily dangerous.\" In determining the extent of an upward departure for a \"weapon or dangerous instrumentality,\" the Sentencing Guidelines state that a court may consider the dangerousness of the weapon, the manner in which it is used (such as whether it was discharged), and the extent to which its use endangered others.

Here, evidence establish that the weapon was a semiautomatic AK-47 with a high capacity, that the bullets fired at the Pounds's home and into the street came from this particular AK-47, and that the AK-47 was discharged at least thirteen times that evening. The government also presented testimony&#8212;considered by the jury in convicting Stokes&#8212;that the AK-47 is a high-powered rifle used by the military and terrorists, and that the armorpiercing bullets were large and powerful. Given the overwhelming evidence supporting the AK-47's dangerousness, we simply fail to see how the court plainly erred in finding this fact to enhance Stokes's sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the future of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines remains uncertain, <i>see United States v.
