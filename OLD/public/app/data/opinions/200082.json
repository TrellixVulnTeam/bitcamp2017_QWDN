WALLACE,\n\n                      Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                                v.\n\n   O.C. TANNER RECOGNITION COMPANY, O.C. TANNER SALES COMPANY,\n                     AND O.C. TANNER COMPANY,\n\n                     Defendants, Appellees.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n          [Hon. Robert E. Keeton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                     Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                  Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     David Rapaport with whom Rapaport & Rapaport was on brief for\nappellant.\n     Mark W. Batten with whom Bingham McCutchen,LLP was on brief\nfor appellees.\n\n\n\n                         August 14, 2002\n\f      COFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge.         Appellant Thomas Wallace was\n\nfifty-three years old when he was terminated from O.C. Tanner\n\nCompany (\"Tanner\") after twenty years of employment and repeated\n\nrecognition as one of the company's top sales managers.                   He\n\ndisputes the company's claim that he was spending excessive time on\n\na personal project that he had concealed from Tanner officials, and\n\nclaims that age discrimination led the company to replace him with\n\nhis thirty-six-year-old subordinate.         The district court granted\n\nsummary judgment for appellee Tanner, finding that Wallace failed\n\nto allege sufficient evidence of age-based animus.           We affirm.\n                             I. Background\n\n      O.C. Tanner Company, based in Salt Lake City, Utah, assists\ncompanies in developing programs to recognize and reward their\nemployees.     Its services include providing custom gifts or jewelry\n\nfor service anniversaries.        Tanner hired appellant in 1975 to help\ndevelop a market in the Northeast.         He began as a salesperson in\nthe   Boston   area,   advanced    to   Regional   Sales   Manager   as   the\n\nsupervisor of several other employees, and achieved a record of\nsuperior performance in generating new business. His region ranked\nin the top ten for sales for twelve of the last fifteen years of\n\nhis employment, and among other recognitions, he shared the \"Most\nImpressive Customer Commitment Award\" with another regional manager\nin 1992.\n\n      In July 1996, however, the Sales Director for the Boston\nregion (and appellant's superior), Rulon Horne, drafted a memo\n\nidentifying eight concerns that had developed about appellant's\n\n                                     -2-\n\fperformance and other work-related matters.                  According to Horne,\n\nappellant's personal sales numbers had been lagging and he had\n\nbecome less involved in the region's business and activities. Doug\nDuckworth, Horne's predecessor, testified that he communicated a\n\nsimilar concern about appellant's \"lack of involvement\" in the\n\nregion to Horne during the transition in sales directors earlier in\nthe year. In addition to declining sales, the issues identified in\n\nHorne's memo included appellant's intimidating management style,\n\nlack of respect for Horne, resistance to signing a confidentiality\n\nagreement, and the lack of growth in repeat sales in the Boston\n\nregion.        Horne also noted two operational changes the company\n\nwished    to    effectuate      in   the    Boston    office:   (1)    to   end    the\n\nrelationship with appellant's wife's brochure business, and (2) to\neither relocate the regional office from a building owned by\n\nappellant or obtain a lease from him.                   Finally, the memo noted\n\nappellant's minimal use of his laptop computer, which frustrated\nthe company's effort to track activity at its field offices.\n\n     A    few    days   after    writing     the     memo,   Horne    met   with   his\n\nsuperiors to discuss his concerns.                Present at the meeting, which\n\nwas held at the corporate office in Salt Lake City, were Tanner's\n\nchief executive officer, Don Ostler; its president, Kent Murdock;\n\nthe executive vice president of sales, Tim Treu; and the vice\n\npresident of sales, Dale Sansom.                 The group agreed that appellant\n\nwould be offered the opportunity to correct the problems, and Horne\n\nand Treu arranged to meet with Wallace in Boston at the end of\n\nAugust.\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\f     In sessions on August 27 and 28, Horne and Treu reviewed with\n\nappellant the concerns listed in Horne's memo.                      Horne testified\n\nthat appellant was not given advance notice of the agenda in order\nto prevent him from \"pre-framing\" his responses.                       Although the\n\nparties differ on certain particulars of the meetings, they agree\n\nthat appellant made a commitment to address each of the eight\nitems. In response to questions about sales performance, appellant\n\nexplained that he had credited much of his own personal business to\n\nDoug Mercer, the senior sales associate in the office.                        Treu's\n\nnotes of the meeting on the first day report that Wallace also\n\nattributed   his    lower    performance          to    other    factors,   including\n\nconcern about his daughter's health.                   In his deposition, however,\n\nappellant    testified      that    he     may    have    made    reference   to   his\ndaughter's illness, but said that her health was not a distraction\n\nthat affected his work for Tanner. He attributed his lower numbers\n\nentirely to the allocation of his business to Mercer and agreed to\nmeet with his staff to re-assign the credit for sales that he --\n\nWallace -- had generated.1          He also promised quick action on other\n\nissues,   stating    that    a     lease    and    the     signed   confidentiality\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       At oral argument, Wallace's counsel asserted that the\ncompany's claim of lower sales performance was inaccurate and thus\nevidence of pretext.     By agreeing to pursue re-allocation of\nbusiness, however, Wallace effectively acknowledged that the\ncompany's figures were based on the information available to it.\nWallace also emphasizes that his sales at the end of his tenure\nwere affected by the loss of a major customer, Digital Equipment\nCorp., which chose a competitor that underbid Tanner by $500,000.\nWallace contends that he was not allowed by his superiors to lower\nTanner's bid to meet the competition.\n\n                                         -4-\n\fagreement would be submitted early the next week, and he would\n\n\"dial in\" on his laptop immediately.\n\n      Treu and Horne returned to Utah on Wednesday, August 28.                    On\nFriday, August 30, the Boston office administrator, Patty Prew,\n\nseparately called two headquarters employees who worked in the\n\nsales promotion and customer service departments, apparently to\nexpress surprise that appellant had not been fired.                 Prew told the\n\ntwo employees, Kathie Lewis and Carol Anderson, that appellant was\n\nnot actively involved in the region's business and was spending\n\nsubstantial time on other, personal activities.                Prew asked that\n\nHorne call her at home the next day so that she could communicate\n\nher   concerns     directly    to    him.      In    a     ninety-minute        phone\n\nconversation with Horne, she reported that appellant had paid\nlittle attention to Tanner business for the past two years because\n\nof his preoccupation with a personal real estate investment.                       He\n\nhad purchased a large parcel of land that he hoped to develop for\ncommercial, residential and recreational uses.\n\n      Aware that Prew was unhappy with appellant because she felt\n\nunderpaid,2      company    officials       sought       confirmation      of     her\n\ninformation from other sources.         Anderson, one of the headquarters\n\nemployees whom Prew had contacted, told Horne and Treu that her\n\nonce-regular     contacts     with   appellant      had   dropped    off   in     the\n\n\n\n\n      2\n       Appellant, in fact, had told Treu and Horne during their\nmeetings earlier in the week that Prew had become a problem in the\noffice because of her dissatisfaction with her pay.\n\n                                      -5-\n\fprevious year or so.3         Lewis reported only two conversations with\n\nappellant during the eight months she had been working with his\n\nregion.      Horne    spoke     with   Mercer      --    ultimately    appellant's\nsuccessor -- who reported that appellant was no longer heavily\n\ninvolved in Tanner business.           Horne and Treu also did an online\n\nsearch of Boston area newspapers and found that they were \"full of\narticles\"     covering meetings and \"battles\" concerning appellant's\n\nreal estate project; Treu's notes describe the coverage as \"one of\n\nthe biggest ongoing stories of the year.\"                  According to Horne's\n\ndeposition testimony, this information \"filled in the unanswered\n\nquestion . . . as to what had really gone on here, and it created,\n\nin   our    mind,   the   perception       that    [appellant]    had       not   been\n\nforthright in his answers to us as to why he was distracted.\"\n      The    four    officers    who    had       met    previously    to    discuss\n\nappellant's work situation -- Horne, Treu, CEO Ostler and company\n\npresident Murdock -- again consulted and decided to terminate him.\nMurdock testified that the company officials felt \"duped\" and\n\n\"misled\" by the discussions with appellant in Boston the previous\n\nweek, concluding that \"he was collecting a lot of money for not\n\ndoing anything at O.C. Tanner.\"            Horne and Treu flew to Boston and\n\ntold appellant       on   September    5   that     he   was   being   terminated,\n\n      3\n       In Treu's notes of an August 30th conversation with\nAnderson, he reported that she had not spoken with appellant \"more\nthan a couple of times in ages,\" and she told him that \"even our\nBoston customers make fun of the fact that Tom is no longer\ninvolved.\"\n     Appellant, however, notes that he had the discretion to\ndelegate contact with Anderson and Lewis to his staff; Anderson\nacknowledged in her deposition that Prew was her main contact in\nthe Boston office.\n\n                                       -6-\n\fattributing the decision to his involvement with the real estate\n\ndevelopment.\n\n     In depositions and documents, appellant offered a competing\nversion of his work habits.    He disputed the contention that he was\n\nneglecting his Tanner duties in favor of the real estate project,\n\nstating that he spent relatively little time on the development.\nHe stated that he devoted full days to Tanner business, though he\n\nworked often at home and sometimes in the middle of the night.          His\n\ncounsel elicited from both Prew and Mercer an acknowledgment that\n\nthey did not know either how he spent his time away from the office\n\nor what he was doing when he was in the office.\n\n     To prove that his termination was not only unjustified, but\n\nmotivated by age discrimination, appellant offered evidence of\nstatements by three Tanner officials.        All but one occurred during\n\nthe mid-1990s and involved comments by Horne's two predecessors as\n\nDirector   of   Sales,   Duckworth    and   Brent   West.   According    to\nappellant, West was the first to ask about his retirement plans.\n\nAppellant responded that he had no plans to retire and intended to\n\nremain with Tanner until age sixty-five.        When West asked the same\n\nquestion about six months later, appellant gave the same answer,\n\nprompting West to reply: \"Well, Tom, don't you think that, you\n\nknow, you get tired of this business, and 65 is a long way away.\"\n\n     The issue of appellant's retirement came up again when Mercer,\n\nhis associate sales representative, bypassed opportunities to apply\n\nfor Regional Sales Manager positions in other areas of the country.\n\nDuckworth asked appellant why the thirty-six-year-old Mercer did\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fnot seek the positions and was told that he did not want to leave\n\nNew England.      Duckworth then asked appellant when he planned to\n\nretire. This occurred twice, and appellant informed Duckworth both\ntimes that he planned to stay on until age sixty-five.\n\n     The final age-related episode occurred during the meeting in\n\nwhich Tanner officials decided to fire appellant.                    Murdock, the\ncompany president and a former trial lawyer, asked about Wallace's\n\nbirth date.      According to Murdock's testimony, he noted at the\n\nmeeting   that    appellant    was    in    the    protected     class    for    age\n\ndiscrimination,      and   that   \"if      he     decided   to     sue   over    his\n\ntermination, . . . he would probably have to hang his hat on age\n\ndiscrimination, but since we weren't doing that, we should go\n\nahead.\"    Horne's notes of the meeting include a notation of\nappellant's age, date of birth, and years of service.\n\n     The district court concluded that appellant had not advanced\n\nsufficient evidence to support a finding that he was terminated\nbecause of his age.        Wallace v. O.C. Tanner Co., 177 F. Supp. 2d\n\n73, 77    (D.    Mass.   2001).      The   court    noted   that,    even   if    it\n\ndisregarded the defense that Wallace was terminated for neglecting\n\nhis work in favor of the real estate project, his evidence at best\n\nsupported the conclusion that Tanner fired him because it knew that\n\nMercer did not want to leave New England and it preferred Mercer to\n\nWallace when faced with the choice.\n\n     On   appeal,    appellant    contends        that   summary    judgment     was\n\nimproper because he proffered sufficient evidence for a jury to\n\nconclude that Tanner's reason for firing him was pretextual, and\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fthat the company's decision to replace him with his subordinate was\n\nmotivated   by   the   age   difference   between   the   two    men.    Our\n\nexamination of the record, conducted de novo, see Rivera-Rodríguez\n\nv. Frito Lay Snacks Caribbean, 265 F.3d 15, 21 (lst Cir. 2001),\n\npersuades us that summary judgment was appropriate.\n\n                              II. Discussion\n\n     Plaintiffs on appeal present their case under the familiar\n\nMcDonnell-Douglas-Burdine-Hicks burden-shifting framework.               See\n\nMcDonnell-Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 804-05 (1973);\n\nTexas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 256\n\n(1981); St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 511, 515\n\n(1993); see also Rivera-Rodríguez, 265 F.3d at 25.4             We jump over\n\nthat starting point here, however, as both parties direct our focus\nto the ultimate question: whether the totality of the evidence,\n\nincluding inferences in plaintiff's favor, \"has raised a genuine\n\nissue of fact as to whether the termination of the plaintiff's\nemployment was motivated by age discrimination,\" Domínguez-Cruz v.\n\nSuttle Caribe, Inc., 202 F.3d 424, 431 (lst Cir. 2000); see id. at\n\n430 (\"At the summary judgment phase, 'courts should not unduly\n\ncomplicate matters . . . by applying legal rules which were devised\n\nto govern the basic allocation of burdens and order of proof.'\"\n\n(citation omitted)).\n\n     As the district court recognized, appellant's case inevitably\n\nstands or falls based upon the strength of his evidence that the\n\n     4\n       Wallace brought claims under both the Age Discrimination in\nEmployment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. §§ 621-634, and the Massachusetts\nFair Employment Practices Act, Mass. Gen. L. ch. 151B, § 4.\n\n                                   -9-\n\factual trigger for his discharge was age-based animus -- whatever\n\nthe reason asserted by his employer.     See Domínquez-Cruz, 202 F.3d\n\nat 430 (\"'The central question in any employment-discrimination\ncase is whether the employer would have taken the same action had\n\nthe employee been of a different . . . age . . . and everything\n\nelse had remained the same.'\") (quoting Carson v. Bethlehem Steel\n\nCorp., 82 F.3d 157, 158 (7th Cir. 1996)).         The evidence appellant\n\nproffers simply does not have sufficient weight to support such a\n\nconclusion.\n\n     None of the inquiries from West and Duckworth about his\n\nretirement plans had significant probative value; they were brief,\n\nstray remarks unrelated to the termination decisional process.\n\nSee, e.g., Shorette v. Rite Aid of Maine, 155 F.3d 8, 13 (lst Cir.\n1998) (asking the plaintiff \"how old he was and when he planned to\n\nretire\" was   \"a   textbook   example   of   an   isolated   remark   which\n\ndemonstrates nothing\").   The longest of the four exchanges -- when\nWest observed that sixty-five \"was a long way off\" and suggested\n\nthat appellant would get tired of the business -- occurred during\n\na conversation in which West expressed concern about his own tenure\n\nand an anticipated demotion. Nothing in the circumstances reflects\n\nWest's or the company's inclination to end appellant's employment\n\nbased on his age.\n\n     Although Duckworth's questions arose in the context of the\n\nyounger Mercer's future with Tanner, there was no accompanying\n\nsuggestion that appellant's value to the company had diminished\n\nbecause of his age; certainly, company officials are permitted to\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fgather information relevant to personnel planning without raising\n\nthe specter of age discrimination.              See, e.g., Cox v. Dubuque Bank\n\n& Trust Co., 163 F.3d 492, 497 (8th Cir. 1998) (\"[M]any courts have\nrecognized that an employer may make reasonable inquiries into the\n\nretirement plans of its employees.\"); Colosi v. Electri-Flex Co.,\n\n965 F.2d 500, 502 (7th Cir. 1992) (\"[A] company has a legitimate\ninterest in learning its employees' plans for the future, and it\n\nwould be absurd to deter such inquiries by treating them as\n\nevidence of unlawful conduct.\").\n\n       Whatever possible weight these comments might have had if\n\neither Duckworth or West had been involved in, or consulted on, the\n\ndecision to fire appellant is circumscribed -- if not entirely\n\nnegated -- by the fact that neither of them played a role in the\ntermination. See, e.g., Santiago-Ramos v. Centennial P.R. Wireless\n\nCorp., 217 F.3d 46, 55 (lst Cir. 2000) (\"Typically, statements made\n\nby 'one who neither makes nor influences [a] challenged personnel\ndecision     are   not    probative      in     an    employment   discrimination\n\ncase.'\");     Shorette,      155      F.3d      at      13   (\"'[S]tatements      by\n\nnondecisionmakers, or statements by decisionmakers unrelated to the\n\ndecisional process itself' normally are insufficient to prove [an]\n\nemployer's discriminatory animus.\").                 Moreover, the most recent of\n\nthe four comments (West's reference to sixty-five as \"a long way\n\noff\") occurred in \"late 95, 96,\" while at least one of the comments\n\noccurred in 1994 or earlier, further diminishing their collective\n\nprobative value.      See, e.g., Straughn v. Delta Airlines, Inc., 250\n\nF.3d   23,   36    (lst   Cir.   2001)    (stating       that   even   comments   by\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\fdecisionmakers         have     limited    probative     value    when   they    are\n\n\"temporally remote from the date of the employment decision,\n\nor   .    .   .    were   not    related    to    the   employment    decision     in\nquestion . . . .\").\n\n         Murdock's comments are only superficially more potent.                 To be\n\nsure, he was a crucial decisionmaker, and appellant's termination\nwas the very purpose of the meeting in which the references to age\n\n-- indeed, to age discrimination -- were made. Murdock's testimony\n\nthat the discussion focused not on appellant's age per se, but on\n\nthe possibility that he would bring an age discrimination lawsuit\n\nis inherently plausible, however, and appellant offers no evidence\n\nto cast doubt on its credibility. Although such discussions may be\n\ndocumented only rarely in an employer's notes, we think it likely\nthat the potential for legal action is routinely addressed when\n\ncompany officials meet to consider terminating an employee.                     See,\n\ne.g., Keller v. ORIX Credit Alliance, Inc., 130 F.3d 1101, 1113 (3d\nCir. 1997) (en banc) (discounting evidence that employer described\n\nthe possibility of litigation as a \"problem\" because \"[n]eedless to\nsay,     even     an   ultimately   unsuccessful        claim   may   constitute   a\n\n'problem'\"); Partington v. Broyhill Furn. Indus., Inc., 999 F.2d\n\n269, 271 (7th Cir. 1993) (\"No inference of guilt can be drawn from\n\nawareness of one's legal obligations; to do so would be to promote\n\nthe ostrich over the farther-seeing species.\"); Flebotte v. Dow\n\nJones & Co., 51 F. Supp. 2d 36, 42 (D. Mass. 1999) (stating that\n\nhandwritten notes referring to \"age issue\" and discussion about age\n\ndiscrimination suit \"indicate the commonplace awareness of the risk\n\n\n                                           -12-\n\fof litigation an employer runs when firing an employee in a\n\nprotected group\").       To cast doubt on Tanner's explanation in these\n\ncircumstances, appellant needs to do more than simply speculate\nthat its motive may have been sinister.             This case is unlike\n\nDominguez-Cruz, 202 F.3d at 433, where notes of the termination\n\ndiscussion referred to both \"age\" and \"age discrimination\" and used\nthe word \"cover-up.\"\n\n     Thus,   even   if    Tanner's   articulated   rationale   for   firing\n\nappellant were unsubstantiated and unpersuasive, appellant would\n\nhave fallen short in his effort to prove that the termination was\n\na product of age discrimination.            Here, however, the company's\n\nexplanation for its decision is without meaningful contradiction.\n\nAppellant attempts to discredit the company's reliance on the\ndistraction of his real estate project, but fails to generate a\n\ngenuine dispute about the honesty of the company's belief that he\n\nwas neglecting his duties in favor of that interest or to adduce\nany evidence of stereotyping.           See Zapata-Matos v. Reckitt &\n\nColman, Inc., 277 F.3d 40, 45-46 (lst Cir. 2002) (focus must be on\n\nthe perception of the decisionmaker subject to the refinement that\n\nin particular instances, e.g., stereotyping, an employer's good-\n\nfaith belief is not automatically conclusive).          Accord Gillen v.\n\nFallon Ambulance Serv., 283 F.3d 11, 29 (lst Cir. 2002).        He merely\n\nhypothesizes an elaborate scheme in which the company's original\n\nintent to fire him in August, when Horne and Treu visited Boston,\n\nwas frustrated by his willingness to repair the identified problems\n\nwith his work, requiring the company to devise an alternative\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fpretextual basis for dismissal.          But as an at-will employee,\n\nappellant could have been terminated without being provided any\n\nopportunity to remedy the deficiencies cited by the company; that\nhe was not fired in August based on Horne's list of concerns\n\nsupports the company's assertion that the discharge stemmed from\n\nits discovery of new information.5\n     Moreover,   it   is   undisputed    that   the   sequence    of   events\n\ndirectly   leading    to   appellant's    termination     began    with   an\n\nunsolicited call from Prew, whose report of deficient performance\n\nwas seemingly substantiated by objective sources: (1) a number of\n\nnewspaper articles showed various aspects of the ongoing story of\n\nappellant's real estate venture, and (2) two headquarters employees\n\nwith no personal stake in appellant's future confirmed his lesser\ninvolvement with the main office.        These reports certainly do not\n\nprove that appellant was neglecting his duties, and one could\n\ncriticize the decision not to allow him to respond, simply as a\n\n     5\n        Appellant argues that Tanner's quick turnaround from\nallowing him to improve to firing him shows that the company was\n\"motivated to accept uncritically any new reason to accomplish the\ntermination,\" and he cites Hodgens v. Gen. Dynamics Corp., 144 F.3d\n151, 168-69 (lst Cir. 1998), for the proposition that a court\nassessing discriminatory motive may consider \"the specific sequence\nof events leading up to the challenged decision.\" We agree with\nhis legal proposition, but disagree that it assists his claim.\n     First, even if the company's change in position were\nsuspicious, it would not be probative of age-based animus. See\nZapata-Matos, 277 F.3d at 45 (\"[T]he ultimate question is not\nwhether the explanation was false, but whether discrimination was\nthe cause of the termination.\"). Second, a sudden change of heart\nby the company is consistent with its expressed reason for the\ndischarge. Although Tanner had decided to give him a chance to\nimprove, when \"confirmation\" of his deficient performance and the\n\"explanation\" for it appeared, the company plausibly could have\nleapt to the conclusion -- perhaps unfairly -- that he had deceived\nthem.\n\n                                  -14-\n\fcourtesy,    after   nearly     twenty       years    of   mostly       excellent\n\nperformance.    The failure to do so, however, does not prove -- or\n\neven suggest -- age bias.\n      Appellant essentially argues that the various wisps of age-\n\nrelated evidence, woven together and viewed in his favor, are\n\nenough to permit a jury to find in his favor.               We cannot agree.\nThe references to age have virtually no probative value, and the\n\nobjective      evidence     substantiates       the    company's         asserted\n\njustification.6      Although    the   record    would     permit   a    jury   to\n\nconclude that the company wrongly attributed changes in appellant's\n\nwork patterns to his involvement with the real estate project, it\n\nwould not permit a finding that that rationale served as a pretext\n\nfor age discrimination.         Cf. Santiago-Ramos, 217 F.3d at 56 (a\n\nplaintiff can demonstrate pretext by identifying \"'weaknesses,\n\nimplausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions\n\nin   the   employer's     proffered    legitimate     reasons'\")        (internal\ncitation omitted).7       Without meaningful indicators of age-based\n\n\n     6\n       Appellant's contention that Tanner's explanation for the\ntermination shifted over time is without support in the record.\nThe company consistently attributed its decision to appellant's\ninvolvement with the real estate project and his failure to discuss\nthe project at the August meeting with Horne and Treu. See, e.g.,\nApp. at 20-21, 305-06, 361-64, 376-78.      Appellant's assertion,\nunsupported by documentary evidence, that the company \"focused\" on\nhis sales performance before the Massachusetts Commission Against\nDiscrimination does not create a contradiction in the company's\nstatements.\n     7\n       Appellant misfires in criticizing the district court for\nattributing his termination to the company's desire to retain\nMercer while failing to recognize that a jury must make a factual\nfinding on the reason for that preference. The district court did\nnot make any finding on the reason for termination.     It simply\naccepted appellant's own assertion that the company fired him\nbecause it preferred Mercer, and concluded that there was\n\n                                      -15-\n\fanimus, and in the absence of evidence to undercut the company's\n\ncredibility, summary judgment for Tanner was proper.\n\n      The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\ninsufficient evidence of age bias to warrant a jury determination.\n\n                              -16-\n\f",

He disputes the company's claim that he was spending excessive time on a personal project that he had concealed from Tanner officials, and claims that age discrimination led the company to replace him with his thirty-six-year-old subordinate. The district court granted summary judgment for appellee Tanner, finding that Wallace failed to allege sufficient evidence of age-based animus. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">O.C. Tanner Company, based in Salt Lake City, Utah, assists companies in developing programs to recognize and reward their employees. Its services include providing custom gifts or jewelry for service anniversaries. Tanner hired appellant in 1975 to help develop a market in the Northeast. He began as a salesperson in the Boston area, advanced to Regional Sales Manager as the supervisor of several other employees, and achieved a record of superior performance in generating new business. His region ranked in the top ten for sales for twelve of the last fifteen years of his employment, and among other recognitions, he shared the \"Most Impressive Customer Commitment Award\" with another regional manager in 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1996, however, the Sales Director for the Boston region (and appellant's superior), Rulon Horne, drafted a memo identifying eight concerns that had developed about appellant's performance and other work-related matters. According to Horne, appellant's personal sales numbers had been lagging and he had become less involved in the region's business and activities. Doug Duckworth, Horne's predecessor, testified that he communicated a similar concern about appellant's \"lack of involvement\" in the region to Horne during the transition in sales directors earlier in the year. In addition to declining sales, the issues identified in Horne's memo included appellant's intimidating management style, lack of respect for Horne, resistance to signing a confidentiality agreement, and the lack of growth in repeat sales in the Boston region. Horne also noted two operational changes the company wished to effectuate in the Boston office: (1) to end the relationship with appellant's wife's brochure business, and (2) to either relocate the regional office from a building owned by appellant or obtain a lease from him. Finally, the memo noted appellant's minimal use of his laptop computer, which frustrated the company's effort to track activity at its field offices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A few days after writing the memo, Horne met with his superiors to discuss his concerns. Present at the meeting, which was held at the corporate office in Salt Lake City, were Tanner's chief executive officer, Don Ostler; its president, Kent Murdock; the executive vice president of sales, Tim Treu; and the vice president of sales, Dale Sansom. The group agreed that appellant would be offered the opportunity to correct the problems, and Horne and Treu arranged to meet with Wallace in Boston at the end of August.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sessions on August 27 and 28, Horne and Treu reviewed with appellant the concerns listed in Horne's memo. Horne testified that appellant was not given advance notice of the agenda in order to prevent him from \"pre-framing\" his responses. Although the parties differ on certain particulars of the meetings, they agree that appellant made a commitment to address each of the eight items. In response to questions about sales performance, appellant explained that he had credited much of his own personal business to Doug Mercer, the senior sales associate in the office. Treu's notes of the meeting on the first day report that Wallace also attributed his lower performance to other factors, including concern about his daughter's health. In his deposition, however, appellant testified that he may have made reference to his daughter's illness, but said that her health was not a distraction that affected his work for Tanner. He attributed his lower numbers entirely to the allocation of his business to Mercer and agreed to meet with his staff to re-assign the credit for sales that he &#8212; Wallace &#8212; had generated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> He also promised quick action on other issues, stating that a lease and the signed confidentiality agreement would be submitted early the next week, and he would \"dial in\" on his laptop immediately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Treu and Horne returned to Utah on Wednesday, August 28. On Friday, August 30, the Boston office administrator, Patty Prew, separately called two headquarters employees who worked in the sales promotion and customer service departments, apparently to express surprise that appellant had not been fired. Prew told the two employees, Kathie Lewis and Carol Anderson, that appellant was not actively involved in the region's business and was spending substantial time on other, personal activities. Prew asked that Horne call her at home the next day so that she could communicate her concerns directly to him. In a ninety-minute phone conversation with Horne, she reported that appellant had paid little attention to Tanner business for the past two years because of his preoccupation with a personal real estate investment. He had purchased a large parcel of land that he hoped to develop for commercial, residential and recreational uses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aware that Prew was unhappy with appellant because she felt underpaid,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> company officials sought confirmation of her information from other sources. Anderson, one of the headquarters employees whom Prew had contacted, told Horne and Treu that her once-regular contacts with appellant had dropped off in the previous year or so.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Lewis reported only two conversations with appellant during the eight months she had been working with his region. Horne spoke with Mercer &#8212; ultimately appellant's successor &#8212; who reported that appellant was no longer heavily involved in Tanner business. Horne and Treu also did an online search of Boston area newspapers and found that they were \"full of articles\" covering meetings and \"battles\" concerning appellant's real estate project; Treu's notes describe the coverage as \"one of the biggest ongoing stories of the year.\" According to Horne's deposition testimony, this information \"filled in the unanswered question ... as to what had really gone on here, and it created, in our mind, the perception that [appellant] had not been forthright in his answers to us as to why he was distracted.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The four officers who had met previously to discuss appellant's work situation &#8212; Horne, Treu, CEO Ostler and company president Murdock &#8212; again consulted and decided to terminate him. Murdock testified that the company officials felt \"duped\" and \"misled\" by the discussions with appellant in Boston the previous week, concluding that \"he was collecting a lot of money for not doing anything at O.C. Tanner.\" Horne and Treu flew to Boston and told appellant on September 5 that he was being terminated, attributing the decision to his involvement with the real estate development.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In depositions and documents, appellant offered a competing version of his work habits. He disputed the contention that he was neglecting his Tanner duties in favor of the real estate project, stating that he spent relatively little time on the development. He stated that he devoted full days to Tanner business, though he worked often at home and sometimes in the middle of the night. His counsel elicited from both Prew and Mercer an acknowledgment that they did not know either how he spent his time away from the office or what he was doing when he was in the office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prove that his termination was not only unjustified, but motivated by age discrimination, appellant offered evidence of statements by three Tanner officials. All but one occurred during the mid-1990s and involved comments by Horne's two predecessors as Director of Sales, Duckworth and Brent West. According to appellant, West was the first to ask about his retirement plans. Appellant responded that he had no plans to retire and intended to remain with Tanner until age sixty-five. When West asked the same question about six months later, appellant gave the same answer, prompting West to reply: \"Well, Tom, don't you think that, you know, you get tired of this business, and 65 is a long way away.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue of appellant's retirement came up again when Mercer, his associate sales representative, bypassed opportunities to apply for Regional Sales Manager positions in other areas of the country. Duckworth asked appellant why the thirty-six-year-old Mercer did not seek the positions and was told that he did not want to leave New England. Duckworth then asked appellant when he planned to retire. This occurred twice, and appellant informed Duckworth both times that he planned to stay on until age sixty-five.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final age-related episode occurred during the meeting in which Tanner officials decided to fire appellant. Murdock, the company president and a former trial lawyer, asked about Wallace's birth date. According to Murdock's testimony, he noted at the meeting that appellant was in the protected class for age discrimination, and that \"if he decided to sue over his termination,... he would probably have to hang his hat on age discrimination, but since we weren't doing that, we should go ahead.\" Horne's notes of the meeting include a notation of appellant's age, date of birth, and years of service.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that appellant had not advanced sufficient evidence to support a finding that he was terminated because of his age. <i>Wallace v. O.C. Tanner Co.,</i> 177 F.Supp.2d 73, 77 (D.Mass. 2001). The court noted that, even if it disregarded the defense that Wallace was terminated for neglecting his work in favor of the real estate project, his evidence at best supported the conclusion that Tanner fired him because it knew that Mercer did not want to leave New England and it preferred Mercer to Wallace when faced with the choice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, appellant contends that summary judgment was improper because he proffered sufficient evidence for a jury to conclude that Tanner's reason for firing him was pretextual, and that the company's decision to replace him with his subordinate was motivated by the age difference between the two men. Our examination of the record, conducted de novo, <i>see Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez v. Frito Lay Snacks Caribbean,</i> 265 F.3d 15, 21 (1st Cir.2001), persuades us that summary judgment was appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Discussion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs on appeal present their case under the familiar <i>McDonnell Douglas-Burdine-Hicks</i> burden-shifting framework. <i>See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</i> 411 U.S. 792, 804-05, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973); <i>Texas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine,</i> 450 U.S. 248, 256, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981); <i>St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks,</i> 509 U.S. 502, 511, 515, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993); <i>see also Rivera-Rodr&#237;guez,</i> 265 F.3d at 25.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> We jump over that starting point here, however, as both parties direct our focus to the ultimate question: whether the totality of the evidence, including inferences in plaintiff's favor, \"has raised a genuine issue of fact as to whether the termination of the plaintiff's employment was motivated by age discrimination,\" <i>Dom&#237;nguez-Cruz v. Suttle Caribe, Inc.,</i> 202 F.3d 424, 431 (1st Cir. 2000); <i>see id.</i> at 430 (\"At the summary judgment phase, `courts should not unduly complicate matters ... by applying legal rules which were devised to govern the basic allocation of burdens and order of proof.'\" (citation omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court recognized, appellant's case inevitably stands or falls based upon the strength of his evidence that the actual trigger for his discharge was age-based animus &#8212; whatever the reason asserted by his employer. <i>See Dom&#237;nquez-Cruz,</i> 202 F.3d at 430 (\"`The central question in any employment-discrimination case is whether the employer would have taken the same action had the employee been of a different ... age ... and everything else had remained the same.'\") (quoting <i>Carson v. Bethlehem Steel Corp.,</i> 82 F.3d 157, 158 (7th Cir.1996)). The evidence appellant proffers simply does not have sufficient weight to support such a conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">None of the inquiries from West and Duckworth about his retirement plans had significant probative value; they were brief, stray remarks unrelated to the termination decisional process. <i>See, e.g., Shorette v. Rite Aid of Maine,</i> 155 F.3d 8, 13 (1st Cir.1998) (asking the plaintiff \"how old he was and when he planned to retire\" was \"a textbook example of an isolated remark which demonstrates nothing\"). The longest of the four exchanges &#8212; when West observed that sixty-five \"was a long way off\" and suggested that appellant would get tired of the business &#8212; occurred during a conversation in which West expressed concern about his own tenure and an anticipated demotion. Nothing in the circumstances reflects West's or the company's inclination to end appellant's employment based on his age.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Duckworth's questions arose in the context of the younger Mercer's future with Tanner, there was no accompanying suggestion that appellant's value to the company had diminished because of his age; certainly, company officials are permitted to gather information relevant to personnel planning without raising the specter of age discrimination. <i>See, e.g., Cox v. Dubuque Bank &amp; Trust Co.,</i> 163 F.3d 492, 497 (8th Cir.1998) (\"[M]any courts have recognized that an employer may make reasonable inquiries into the retirement plans of its employees.\"); <i>Colosi v. Electri-Flex Co.,</i> 965 F.2d 500, 502 (7th Cir.1992) (\"[A] company has a legitimate interest in learning its employees' plans for the future, and it would be absurd to deter such inquiries by treating them as evidence of unlawful conduct.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whatever possible weight these comments might have had if either Duckworth or West had been involved in, or consulted on, the decision to fire appellant is circumscribed &#8212; if not entirely negated &#8212; by the fact that neither of them played a role in the termination. <i>See, e.g., Santiago-Ramos v. Centennial P.R. Wireless Corp.,</i> 217 F.3d 46, 55 (1st Cir.2000) (\"Typically, statements made by `one who neither makes nor influences [a] challenged personnel decision are not probative in an employment discrimination case.'\"); <i>Shorette,</i> 155 F.3d at 13 (\"`[S]tatements by nondecisionmakers, or statements by decisionmakers unrelated to the decisional process itself' normally are insufficient to prove [an] employer's discriminatory animus.\"). Moreover, the most recent of the four comments (West's reference to sixty-five as \"a long way off\") occurred in \"late 95, 96,\" while at least one of the comments occurred in 1994 or earlier, further diminishing their collective probative value. <i>See, e.g., Straughn v. Delta Air Lines, Inc.,</i> 250 F.3d 23, 36 (1st Cir.2001) (stating that even comments by decisionmakers have limited probative value when they are \"temporally remote from the date of the employment decision, or ... were not related to the employment decision in question....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Murdock's comments are only superficially more potent. To be sure, he was a crucial decisionmaker, and appellant's termination was the very purpose of the meeting in which the references to age &#8212; indeed, to age discrimination &#8212; were made. Murdock's testimony that the discussion focused not on appellant's age per se, but on the possibility that he would bring an age discrimination lawsuit is inherently plausible, however, and appellant offers no evidence to cast doubt on its credibility. Although such discussions may be documented only rarely in an employer's notes, we think it likely that the potential for legal action is routinely addressed when company officials meet to consider terminating an employee. <i>See, e.g., Keller v. Orix Credit Alliance, Inc.,</i> 130 F.3d 1101, 1113 (3d Cir.1997) (en banc) (discounting evidence that employer described the possibility of litigation as a \"problem\" because \"[n]eedless to say, even an ultimately unsuccessful claim may constitute a `problem'\"); <i>Partington v. Broyhill Furn. Indus., Inc.,</i> 999 F.2d 269, 271 (7th Cir.1993) (\"No inference of guilt can be drawn from awareness of one's legal obligations; to do so would be to promote the ostrich over the farther-seeing species.\"); <i>Flebotte v. Dow Jones &amp; Co.,</i> 51 F.Supp.2d 36, 42 (D.Mass.1999) (stating that handwritten notes referring to \"age issue\" and discussion about age discrimination suit \"indicate the commonplace awareness of the risk of litigation an employer runs when firing an employee in a protected group\"). To cast doubt on Tanner's explanation in these circumstances, appellant needs to do more than simply speculate that its motive may have been sinister. This case is unlike <i>Dominguez-Cruz,</i> 202 F.3d at 433, where notes of the termination discussion referred to both \"age\" and \"age discrimination\" and used the word \"cover-up.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, even if Tanner's articulated rationale for firing appellant were unsubstantiated and unpersuasive, appellant would have fallen short in his effort to prove that the termination was a product of age discrimination. Here, however, the company's explanation for its decision is without meaningful contradiction. Appellant attempts to discredit the company's reliance on the distraction of his real estate project, but fails to generate a genuine dispute about the honesty of the company's belief that he was neglecting his duties in favor of that interest or to adduce any evidence of stereotyping. <i>See Zapata-Matos v. Reckitt &amp; Colman, Inc.,</i> 277 F.3d 40, 45-46 (1st Cir.2002) (focus must be on the perception of the decisionmaker subject to the refinement that in particular instances, e.g., stereotyping, an employer's good-faith belief is not automatically conclusive). <i>Accord Gillen v. Fallon Ambulance Serv.,</i> 283 F.3d 11, 29 (1st Cir.2002). He merely hypothesizes an elaborate scheme in which the company's original intent to fire him in August, when Horne and Treu visited Boston, was frustrated by his willingness to repair the identified problems with his work, requiring the company to devise an alternative pretextual basis for dismissal. But as an at-will employee, appellant could have been terminated without being provided any opportunity to remedy the deficiencies cited by the company; that he was not fired in August based on Horne's list of concerns supports the company's assertion that the discharge stemmed from its discovery of new information.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, it is undisputed that the sequence of events directly leading to appellant's termination began with an unsolicited call from Prew, whose report of deficient performance was seemingly substantiated by objective sources: (1) a number of newspaper articles showed various aspects of the ongoing story of appellant's real estate venture, and (2) two headquarters employees with no personal stake in appellant's future confirmed his lesser involvement with the main office. These reports certainly do not prove that appellant was neglecting his duties, and one could criticize the decision not to allow him to respond, simply as a courtesy, after nearly twenty years of mostly excellent performance. The failure to do so, however, does not prove &#8212; or even suggest &#8212; age bias.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant essentially argues that the various wisps of age-related evidence, woven together and viewed in his favor, are enough to permit a jury to find in his favor. We cannot agree. The references to age have virtually no probative value, and the objective evidence substantiates the company's asserted justification.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Although the record would permit a jury to conclude that the company wrongly attributed changes in appellant's work patterns to his involvement with the real estate project, it would not permit a finding that that rationale served as a pretext for age discrimination. <i>Cf.

Second, a sudden change of heart by the company is consistent with its expressed reason for the discharge.

He disputes the company's claim that he was spending excessive time on a personal project that he had concealed from Tanner officials, and claims that age discrimination led the company to replace him with his thirty-six-year-old subordinate. The district court granted summary judgment for appellee Tanner, finding that Wallace failed to allege sufficient evidence of age-based animus. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">O.C. Tanner Company, based in Salt Lake City, Utah, assists companies in developing programs to recognize and reward their employees. Its services include providing custom gifts or jewelry for service anniversaries. Tanner hired appellant in 1975 to help develop a market in the Northeast. He began as a salesperson in the Boston area, advanced to Regional Sales Manager as the supervisor of several other employees, and achieved a record of superior performance in generating new business. His region ranked in the top ten for sales for twelve of the last fifteen years of his employment, and among other recognitions, he shared the \"Most Impressive Customer Commitment Award\" with another regional manager in 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1996, however, the Sales Director for the Boston region (and appellant's superior), Rulon Horne, drafted a memo identifying eight concerns that had developed about appellant's performance and other work-related matters. According to Horne, appellant's personal sales numbers had been lagging and he had become less involved in the region's business and activities. Doug Duckworth, Horne's predecessor, testified that he communicated a similar concern about appellant's \"lack of involvement\" in the region to Horne during the transition in sales directors earlier in the year. In addition to declining sales, the issues identified in Horne's memo included appellant's intimidating management style, lack of respect for Horne, resistance to signing a confidentiality agreement, and the lack of growth in repeat sales in the Boston region. Horne also noted two operational changes the company wished to effectuate in the Boston office: (1) to end the relationship with appellant's wife's brochure business, and (2) to either relocate the regional office from a building owned by appellant or obtain a lease from him. Finally, the memo noted appellant's minimal use of his laptop computer, which frustrated the company's effort to track activity at its field offices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A few days after writing the memo, Horne met with his superiors to discuss his concerns. Present at the meeting, which was held at the corporate office in Salt Lake City, were Tanner's chief executive officer, Don Ostler; its president, Kent Murdock; the executive vice president of sales, Tim Treu; and the vice president of sales, Dale Sansom. The group agreed that appellant would be offered the opportunity to correct the problems, and Horne and Treu arranged to meet with Wallace in Boston at the end of August.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sessions on August 27 and 28, Horne and Treu reviewed with appellant the concerns listed in Horne's memo. Horne testified that appellant was not given advance notice of the agenda in order to prevent him from \"pre-framing\" his responses. Although the parties differ on certain particulars of the meetings, they agree that appellant made a commitment to address each of the eight items. In response to questions about sales performance, appellant explained that he had credited much of his own personal business to Doug Mercer, the senior sales associate in the office. Treu's notes of the meeting on the first day report that Wallace also attributed his lower performance to other factors, including concern about his daughter's health. In his deposition, however, appellant testified that he may have made reference to his daughter's illness, but said that her health was not a distraction that affected his work for Tanner. He attributed his lower numbers entirely to the allocation of his business to Mercer and agreed to meet with his staff to re-assign the credit for sales that he &#8212; Wallace &#8212; had generated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> He also promised quick action on other issues, stating that a lease and the signed confidentiality agreement would be submitted early the next week, and he would \"dial in\" on his laptop immediately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Treu and Horne returned to Utah on Wednesday, August 28. On Friday, August 30, the Boston office administrator, Patty Prew, separately called two headquarters employees who worked in the sales promotion and customer service departments, apparently to express surprise that appellant had not been fired. Prew told the two employees, Kathie Lewis and Carol Anderson, that appellant was not actively involved in the region's business and was spending substantial time on other, personal activities. Prew asked that Horne call her at home the next day so that she could communicate her concerns directly to him. In a ninety-minute phone conversation with Horne, she reported that appellant had paid little attention to Tanner business for the past two years because of his preoccupation with a personal real estate investment. He had purchased a large parcel of land that he hoped to develop for commercial, residential and recreational uses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aware that Prew was unhappy with appellant because she felt underpaid,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> company officials sought confirmation of her information from other sources. Anderson, one of the headquarters employees whom Prew had contacted, told Horne and Treu that her once-regular contacts with appellant had dropped off in the previous year or so.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Lewis reported only two conversations with appellant during the eight months she had been working with his region. Horne spoke with Mercer &#8212; ultimately appellant's successor &#8212; who reported that appellant was no longer heavily involved in Tanner business. Horne and Treu also did an online search of Boston area newspapers and found that they were \"full of articles\" covering meetings and \"battles\" concerning appellant's real estate project; Treu's notes describe the coverage as \"one of the biggest ongoing stories of the year.\" According to Horne's deposition testimony, this information \"filled in the unanswered question ... as to what had really gone on here, and it created, in our mind, the perception that [appellant] had not been forthright in his answers to us as to why he was distracted.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The four officers who had met previously to discuss appellant's work situation &#8212; Horne, Treu, CEO Ostler and company president Murdock &#8212; again consulted and decided to terminate him. Murdock testified that the company officials felt \"duped\" and \"misled\" by the discussions with appellant in Boston the previous week, concluding that \"he was collecting a lot of money for not doing anything at O.C. Tanner.\" Horne and Treu flew to Boston and told appellant on September 5 that he was being terminated, attributing the decision to his involvement with the real estate development.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In depositions and documents, appellant offered a competing version of his work habits. He disputed the contention that he was neglecting his Tanner duties in favor of the real estate project, stating that he spent relatively little time on the development. He stated that he devoted full days to Tanner business, though he worked often at home and sometimes in the middle of the night. His counsel elicited from both Prew and Mercer an acknowledgment that they did not know either how he spent his time away from the office or what he was doing when he was in the office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prove that his termination was not only unjustified, but motivated by age discrimination, appellant offered evidence of statements by three Tanner officials. All but one occurred during the mid-1990s and involved comments by Horne's two predecessors as Director of Sales, Duckworth and Brent West. According to appellant, West was the first to ask about his retirement plans. Appellant responded that he had no plans to retire and intended to remain with Tanner until age sixty-five. When West asked the same question about six months later, appellant gave the same answer, prompting West to reply: \"Well, Tom, don't you think that, you know, you get tired of this business, and 65 is a long way away.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue of appellant's retirement came up again when Mercer, his associate sales representative, bypassed opportunities to apply for Regional Sales Manager positions in other areas of the country. Duckworth asked appellant why the thirty-six-year-old Mercer did not seek the positions and was told that he did not want to leave New England. Duckworth then asked appellant when he planned to retire. This occurred twice, and appellant informed Duckworth both times that he planned to stay on until age sixty-five.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final age-related episode occurred during the meeting in which Tanner officials decided to fire appellant. Murdock, the company president and a former trial lawyer, asked about Wallace's birth date. According to Murdock's testimony, he noted at the meeting that appellant was in the protected class for age discrimination, and that \"if he decided to sue over his termination,... he would probably have to hang his hat on age discrimination, but since we weren't doing that, we should go ahead.\" Horne's notes of the meeting include a notation of appellant's age, date of birth, and years of service.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that appellant had not advanced sufficient evidence to support a finding that he was terminated because of his age. <i>Wallace v. O.C. Tanner Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2571008\"><a href=\"/opinion/2571008/wallace-v-oc-tanner-recognition-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">177</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">73</span></a></span>, 77 (D.Mass. 2001). The court noted that, even if it disregarded the defense that Wallace was terminated for neglecting his work in favor of the real estate project, his evidence at best supported the conclusion that Tanner fired him because it knew that Mercer did not want to leave New England and it preferred Mercer to Wallace when faced with the choice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, appellant contends that summary judgment was improper because he proffered sufficient evidence for a jury to conclude that Tanner's reason for firing him was pretextual, and that the company's decision to replace him with his subordinate was motivated by the age difference between the two men.

Centennial P.R. Wireless Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198991\"><a href=\"/opinion/198991/santiago-ramos-v-centennial-pr-wire/\"><span class=\"volume\">217</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 55 (1st Cir.2000) (\"Typically, statements made by `one who neither makes nor influences [a] challenged personnel decision are not probative in an employment discrimination case.'\"); <i>Shorette,</i> 155 F.3d at 13 (\"`[S]tatements by nondecisionmakers, or statements by decisionmakers unrelated to the decisional process itself' normally are insufficient to prove [an] employer's discriminatory animus.\"). Moreover, the most recent of the four comments (West's reference to sixty-five as \"a long way off\") occurred in \"late 95, 96,\" while at least one of the comments occurred in 1994 or earlier, further diminishing their collective probative value. <i>See, e.g., Straughn v. Delta Air Lines, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773251\"><a href=\"/opinion/773251/claire-a-straughn-v-delta-air-lines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">250</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span>, 36 (1st Cir.2001) (stating that even comments by decisionmakers have limited probative value when they are \"temporally remote from the date of the employment decision, or ... were not related to the employment decision in question....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Murdock's comments are only superficially more potent. To be sure, he was a crucial decisionmaker, and appellant's termination was the very purpose of the meeting in which the references to age &#8212; indeed, to age discrimination &#8212; were made. Murdock's testimony that the discussion focused not on appellant's age per se, but on the possibility that he would bring an age discrimination lawsuit is inherently plausible, however, and appellant offers no evidence to cast doubt on its credibility. Although such discussions may be documented only rarely in an employer's notes, we think it likely that the potential for legal action is routinely addressed when company officials meet to consider terminating an employee. <i>See, e.g., Keller v. Orix Credit Alliance, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1101</span></span>, 1113 (3d Cir.1997) (en banc) (discounting evidence that employer described the possibility of litigation as a \"problem\" because \"[n]eedless to say, even an ultimately unsuccessful claim may constitute a `problem'\"); <i>Partington v. Broyhill Furn. Indus., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"611660\"><a href=\"/opinion/611660/james-r-partington-v-broyhill-furniture-industries-incorporated/\"><span class=\"volume\">999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">269</span></a></span>, 271 (7th Cir.1993) (\"No inference of guilt can be drawn from awareness of one's legal obligations; to do so would be to promote the ostrich over the farther-seeing species.\"); <i>Flebotte v.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 42 (D.Mass.1999) (stating that handwritten notes referring to \"age issue\" and discussion about age discrimination suit \"indicate the commonplace awareness of the risk of litigation an employer runs when firing an employee in a protected group\"). To cast doubt on Tanner's explanation in these circumstances, appellant needs to do more than simply speculate that its motive may have been sinister. This case is unlike <i>Dominguez-Cruz,</i> 202 F.3d at 433, where notes of the termination discussion referred to both \"age\" and \"age discrimination\" and used the word \"cover-up.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, even if Tanner's articulated rationale for firing appellant were unsubstantiated and unpersuasive, appellant would have fallen short in his effort to prove that the termination was a product of age discrimination. Here, however, the company's explanation for its decision is without meaningful contradiction. Appellant attempts to discredit the company's reliance on the distraction of his real estate project, but fails to generate a genuine dispute about the honesty of the company's belief that he was neglecting his duties in favor of that interest or to adduce any evidence of stereotyping. <i>See Zapata-Matos v. Reckitt &amp; Colman, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776184\"><a href=\"/opinion/776184/ram-n-zapata-matos-v-reckitt-colman-inc-fka-lf-products/\"><span class=\"volume\">277</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></a></span>, 45-46 (1st Cir.2002) (focus must be on the perception of the decisionmaker subject to the refinement that in particular instances, e.g., stereotyping, an employer's good-faith belief is not automatically conclusive). <i>Accord Gillen v. Fallon Ambulance Serv.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199872\"><a href=\"/opinion/199872/gillen-v-fallon-service-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 29 (1st Cir.2002). He merely hypothesizes an elaborate scheme in which the company's original intent to fire him in August, when Horne and Treu visited Boston, was frustrated by his willingness to repair the identified problems with his work, requiring the company to devise an alternative pretextual basis for dismissal. But as an at-will employee, appellant could have been terminated without being provided any opportunity to remedy the deficiencies cited by the company; that he was not fired in August based on Horne's list of concerns supports the company's assertion that the discharge stemmed from its discovery of new information.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, it is undisputed that the sequence of events directly leading to appellant's termination began with an unsolicited call from Prew, whose report of deficient performance was seemingly substantiated by objective sources: (1) a number of newspaper articles showed various aspects of the ongoing story of appellant's real estate venture, and (2) two headquarters employees with no personal stake in appellant's future confirmed his lesser involvement with the main office. These reports certainly do not prove that appellant was neglecting his duties, and one could criticize the decision not to allow him to respond, simply as a courtesy, after nearly twenty years of mostly excellent performance. The failure to do so, however, does not prove &#8212; or even suggest &#8212; age bias.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant essentially argues that the various wisps of age-related evidence, woven together and viewed in his favor, are enough to permit a jury to find in his favor. We cannot agree. The references to age have virtually no probative value, and the objective evidence substantiates the company's asserted justification.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Although the record would permit a jury to conclude that the company wrongly attributed changes in appellant's work patterns to his involvement with the real estate project, it would not permit a finding that that rationale served as a pretext for age discrimination. <i>Cf. Santiago-Ramos,</i> 217 F.3d at 56 (a plaintiff can demonstrate pretext by identifying \"`weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons'\") (internal citation omitted).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Without meaningful indicators of age-based animus, and in the absence of evidence to undercut the company's credibility, summary judgment for Tanner was proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> At oral argument, Wallace's counsel asserted that the company's claim of lower sales performance was inaccurate and thus evidence of pretext.

Wallace also emphasizes that his sales at the end of his tenure were affected by the loss of a major customer, Digital Equipment Corp., which chose a competitor that underbid Tanner by $500,000.

Gen.

Second, a sudden change of heart by the company is consistent with its expressed reason for the discharge. Although Tanner had decided to give him a chance to improve, when \"confirmation\" of his deficient performance and the \"explanation\" for it appeared, the company plausibly could have leapt to the conclusion &#8212; perhaps unfairly &#8212; that he had deceived them.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Appellant's contention that Tanner's explanation for the termination shifted over time is without support in the record. The company consistently attributed its decision to appellant's involvement with the real estate project and his failure to discuss the project at the August meeting with Horne and Treu<i>See, e.g.,</i> App. at 20-21, 305-06, 361-64, 376-78.

The district court did not make any finding on the reason for termination. It simply accepted appellant's own assertion that the company fired him because it preferred Mercer, and concluded that there was insufficient evidence of age bias to warrant a jury determination</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
