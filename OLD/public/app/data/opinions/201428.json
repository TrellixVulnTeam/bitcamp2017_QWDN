The    Internal   Revenue\n\nService (\"IRS\"), acting pursuant to 26 U.S.C. § 6672, assessed a\n\npenalty against Appellant Paul Jean (\"Paul\"), an employee of Focus\n\nFinancial Services (\"Focus\"), for unpaid income and social security\n\ntaxes withheld from the wages of Focus' employees in 1992.                         Paul\n\npaid       a   portion   of   the   assessment     and,    after    exhausting      his\n\nadministrative remedies, sued the IRS in the United States District\n\nCourt for the District of Massachusetts for a refund and an\n\nabatement of the balance of the assessment.1                 The government filed\n\na counterclaim, seeking to recover the balance of the assessment.\n\nAt the close of the evidence at trial, the district court entered\n\njudgment in Paul's favor.             Paul, then, filed a motion to recover\n\nhis administrative and litigation costs under 26 U.S.C. § 7430.\n\nThe    district      court,    in    denying     the     motion,    found   that    the\n\ngovernment was substantially justified in issuing the assessment\n\nand pursuing the litigation. Paul now seeks review of that denial.\n\nFinding no error, we affirm.\n\n                                    I.   Background\n\n                In 1985, Michael Pottle (\"Pottle\") incorporated Focus.\n\nHe served as Focus' president and treasurer and was the company's\n\nsole shareholder.         Pottle hired George Jean (\"George\") to serve as\n\n\n\n       1\n      See 28 U.S.C. § 1346(a)(1); Ruth v. United States, 823 F.2d\n1091, 1093 (7th Cir. 1987) (\"The taxpayer is permitted to challenge\nan assessment [under § 6672] in the district court merely by paying\na portion of the assessment and then seeking a refund.\").\n\n                                          -2-\n\fthe company's vice-president and general manager. Initially, Focus\n\nprovided debt collection services out of an office in Plymouth,\n\nMassachusetts. By 1987, Focus also had a credit reporting business\n\nin Lynn, Massachusetts.2     Notwithstanding this expansion, even\n\nafter 1987, all of the company's bills were paid out of its\n\nPlymouth office.\n\n          In 1987, Pottle hired George's son, Paul, to work part-\n\ntime as a bookkeeper for Focus.          Paul was given full signatory\n\nauthority over Focus' bank accounts; that is, he had the power to\n\ndisburse funds from the company's accounts.3         Paul, who worked in\n\nthe Plymouth office, signed many of the checks issued by Focus,\n\nincluding checks issued to cover Focus' tax liabilities.\n\n          Sometime   in    1991,     Focus   began    having   financial\n\ndifficulties, which culminated in its failure to pay the IRS taxes\n\nthat had been withheld from its employees' wages for the first\n\nthree quarters of 1992.     During those quarters, however, Focus\n\ncontinued to pay its employees and other creditors.\n\n          Paul signed most of the checks that Focus issued in the\n\nfirst two quarters of 1992--he signed 114 checks, transferring\n\n$284,353.22 to Focus' creditors, of which $202,360.96 was paid to\n\ncreditors other than the IRS.      On August 2, 1992, during the third\n\n\n     2\n      Focus ceased operating the credit reporting business and\nclosed its Lynn office in 1991.\n     3\n      Paul was listed as an authorized signatory on the bank cards\nfor Focus' accounts.\n\n                                   -3-\n\fquarter, Paul relinquished his signatory authority; apparently, he\n\nfeared being held liable for Focus' failure to pay the IRS.\n\n           On December 20, 1994, pursuant to 26 U.S.C. § 6672, the\n\nIRS   proposed   to   assess   Paul     for   Focus'   unpaid    withholding\n\nobligations.     The IRS viewed Paul as a \"responsible person\" of\n\nFocus who had willfully failed to pay the company's taxes.             Prior\n\nto the issuance of the proposed assessment, in May 1994, Pottle\n\nfiled with the IRS a statement in which he averred that he and\n\nGeorge were the only persons with authority over Focus' finances.\n\nPottle failed to mention that, during much of the relevant period,\n\nPaul had been authorized to disburse, and had in fact disbursed,\n\nmoney from Focus' bank accounts.              Paul appealed the proposed\n\nassessment to the IRS Office of Appeals on January 12, 1995.              On\n\nJune 28, 1996, the Office of Appeals rejected Paul's challenge.\n\n           On August 12, 1996, the IRS assessed a penalty against\n\nPaul in the amount of $31,825.66 for Focus' tax liabilities for the\n\nfirst three quarters of 1992, the period from January 1, 1992 to\n\nSeptember 30, 1992. The IRS made a like assessment against George.\n\nPaul and George, on November 16, 1999, each paid the IRS $84.00 and\n\nfiled refund claims with the agency.          The claims were denied, and\n\non June 30, 2000, Paul and George sued the IRS in district court\n\nfor refunds of the sums paid and an abatement of the balance of the\n\nassessment.      In   response,   the   government     filed   counterclaims\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fagainst Paul and George for the portion of the assessment that\n\nremained unpaid.4\n\n          During discovery, Pottle and Paul were deposed.5          At his\n\ndeposition, Paul stated that he had the authority to write checks\n\nto pay Focus' smaller bills, \"certainly [invoices] under $100, for\n\nexample,\" without first obtaining approval from Pottle or George.\n\nHowever, he said that he did not have the authority to pay Focus'\n\n\"larger invoices--telephone bills, for example,\" without obtaining\n\nprior approval.     Paul testified that there were no \"specific . . .\n\ncriteria that [were] employed [to distinguish the smaller bills\n\nfrom the larger ones].\"\n\n          In addition, Paul acknowledged that once Focus began\n\nexperiencing   financial   difficulties,   he   participated   in   daily\n\nmeetings with Pottle and George during which Focus' financial\n\nobligations were discussed and it was decided which bills were to\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      It appears that, in 1998, the IRS reduced the amount of the\nassessment against Paul because Pottle had paid Focus' taxes for\nthe third quarter of 1992. Accordingly, the government insists\nthat it never sought to collect third quarter taxes from Paul in\nconnection with the litigation in question. Because neither the\nallegations in the government's counterclaim nor its subsequent\nbehavior in the litigation rendered its position as to the third\nquarter taxes clear, in deciding the issues raised in this appeal,\nwe assume that the IRS sought to collect third quarter taxes from\nPaul.\n     5\n      George was also deposed, but neither party has identified his\ndeposition as relevant to this appeal.\n\n                                  -5-\n\fbe paid.6   The extent of Paul's involvement in the meetings and in\n\nthe ultimate decision as to which creditors were to be paid is\n\nunclear from the deposition transcript.     Paul also admitted that,\n\nin 1992, he was aware that Focus had not paid its taxes but that it\n\nwas paying its employees' salaries and other obligations.\n\n            Pottle testified at his deposition that Paul lacked the\n\nauthority to make independent spending decisions. But, Pottle also\n\nstated that, at all relevant times, George was responsible for the\n\nday-to-day operations of the company's business in Plymouth.    And,\n\nPottle said that he rarely visited the Plymouth office after the\n\nfirst few years of Focus' existence.\n\n            Following the close of discovery, Paul filed a motion for\n\nsummary judgment in which he asserted that the undisputed facts\n\nestablished that he was not a person responsible for the payment of\n\ntaxes by Focus because he never had the authority to decide which\n\nof Focus' creditors were to be paid.    At the same time, Paul filed\n\nan affidavit in which he maintained that he was nothing more than\n\na clerical employee of Focus; he insisted that he:      (1) \"did not\n\nhave the authority . . . to determine which creditors were to be\n\npaid\"; (2) \"was not an officer, shareholder or director\"; (3) \"was\n\ncontrolled by [] Pottle\"; (4) \"did not have the actual ability to\n\n\n\n\n     6\n      Paul testified that \"as the financial situation grew tighter,\nthen virtually any bill and any creditor would have been paid in\nconsultation with [] Pottle.\"\n\n                                 -6-\n\festablish financial policies or procedures\"; and (5) \"did not have\n\nthe ability to hire or fire employees.\"\n\n          The government opposed the motion, arguing that the scope\n\nof Paul's authority to determine which of Focus' creditors were to\n\nbe paid was in dispute.    The government pointed out that, at his\n\ndeposition, Paul testified that he had the authority to pay certain\n\ncreditors without prior approval and participated in daily meetings\n\nwith Pottle and George concerning Focus' financial obligations.\n\n          The district court allowed the motion in part and denied\n\nit in part.   It concluded that, for the period from January 1, 1992\n\nthrough August 1, 1992 (the first, the second, and part of the\n\nthird quarter), there was a genuine dispute as to whether Paul had\n\nthe requisite decision-making authority to render him a person\n\nresponsible for payment of taxes by Focus.         By contrast, it\n\nreasoned that Paul's relinquishment of his check-signing authority\n\non August 2, 1992 left him in a position where, after that date, he\n\nclearly lacked authority to pay taxes.     Therefore, the district\n\ncourt allowed the motion as to the period from August 2, 1992\n\nthrough September 30, 1992 and denied it as to the period from\n\nJanuary 1, 1992 through August 1, 1992.\n\n          After the close of evidence at trial, Paul filed a motion\n\nfor a directed verdict, which the district court allowed.      Paul\n\nthen moved for administrative and litigation costs under 26 U.S.C.\n\n§ 7430.   The government opposed the motion, claiming that it was\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fsubstantially justified in taking the position that Paul was liable\n\nfor Focus' tax deficiencies.     The district court agreed with the\n\ngovernment and denied the motion.      Paul now seeks review of that\n\ndenial.\n\n                          II.    Discussion\n\n           We have not previously addressed the question of what\n\nstandard of review applies to a district court's ruling on a motion\n\nfor costs pursuant to 26 U.S.C. § 7430.       We will follow our sister\n\ncircuits and review the district court's determination that Paul\n\nwas not entitled to costs under § 7430 for abuse of discretion.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Bisbee, 245 F.3d 1001, 1007 (8th Cir.\n\n2001); Wilkerson v. United States, 67 F.3d 112, 119 (5th Cir.\n\n1995); Cooper v. United States, 60 F.3d 1529, 1531 (11th Cir.\n\n1995); Awmiller v. United States, 1 F.3d 930, 930 (9th Cir. 1993);\n\nWilfong v. United States, 991 F.2d 359, 364 (7th Cir. 1993); Pate\n\nv. United States, 982 F.2d 457, 459 (10th Cir. 1993).\n\nA.         Statutory Framework\n\n           At the outset, we review the statutory framework relevant\n\nto this appeal.\n\n           1.     26 U.S.C. §§ 3102, 3402, 6672\n\n           The Internal Revenue Code requires employers to withhold\n\nfederal income taxes from their employees' wages. Slodov v. United\n\nStates, 436 U.S. 238, 242-43 (1978); see 26 U.S.C. §§ 3102(a),\n\n3402(a).    The withheld sums are to be paid to the IRS on a\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fquarterly basis.    Slodov, 436 U.S. at 243.   \"An employer who fails\n\nto pay taxes withheld from its employees' wages is . . . liable for\n\nthe [unpaid] taxes . . . .\"     Id.    Moreover, 26 U.S.C. § 6672(a)\n\nextends liability for unpaid taxes by providing:\n\n          Any person required to collect, truthfully\n          account for, and pay over any tax imposed by\n          this title who willfully fails to collect such\n          tax, or truthfully account for and pay over\n          such tax, or willfully attempts in any manner\n          to evade or defeat any such tax or the payment\n          thereof, shall, in addition to other penalties\n          provided by law, be liable to a penalty equal\n          to the total amount of the tax evaded, or not\n          collected, or not accounted for and paid over.\n\nFor purposes of § 6672(a), a \"'person' . . . includes an officer or\n\nemployee of a corporation . . . who . . . is under a duty to\n\nperform the act in respect of which the violation occurs.\"        26\n\nU.S.C. § 6671(b).   Thus, an employee may be liable under § 6672(a)\n\nif he (1) is a person who is \"required to collect, truthfully\n\naccount for, [or] pay over\" the taxes (a \"responsible person\"),7\n\nand (2) \"willfully\" fails to do so.    See Thomsen v. United States,\n\n887 F.2d 12, 14 (1st Cir. 1989).   An individual deemed liable under\n\n§ 6672(a) bears the burden of proving that he was not a responsible\n\nperson and does not meet the willfulness requirement.      Stuart v.\n\nUnited States, 337 F.3d 31, 36 (1st Cir. 2003); see Lubetzky v.\n\n\n     7\n      Although § 6672(a) \"defines a responsible person as one who\nis 'required to collect, truthfully account for, and pay over any\ntax,' . . . the Supreme Court has interpreted the statute to apply\nto any person who has a duty to do any one of those things, see\nSlodov, 436 U.S. at 250 . . . .\" Vinick v. United States, 205 F.3d\n1, 7 n.6 (1st Cir. 2000) (emphasis added).\n\n                                 -9-\n\fUnited States, No. 01-2357, 2004 WL 2997888, at *3 (1st Cir. Dec.\n\n29, 2004).\n\n          There is no single factor that determines whether an\n\nindividual is a responsible person.8         Vinick, 205 F.3d at 8.\n\nIndicia of responsibility include whether the individual:\n\n          (1) is an officer or member of the board of\n          directors, (2) owns shares or possesses an\n          entrepreneurial stake in the company, (3) is\n          active in the management of day-to-day affairs\n          of the company, (4) has the ability to hire\n          and fire employees, (5) makes decisions\n          regarding which, when and in what order\n          outstanding debts or taxes will be paid, (6)\n          exercises control over daily bank accounts and\n          disbursement records, and (7) has check-\n          signing authority.9\n\nId. at 7 (citation omitted); see Lubetzky, 2004 WL 2997888, at *3.\n\nHowever, \"the   crucial   inquiry   is   whether   the   person   had   the\n\neffective power to pay the taxes--that is, whether he had the\n\nactual authority or ability, in view of his status within the\n\ncorporation, to pay the taxes owed.\"          Vinick, 205 F.3d at 8\n\n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).         Therefore, the\n\nfinal three factors in the above list are the most significant\n\n\n\n\n     8\n      Of course, \"[t]here may be more than one responsible person.\"\nStuart, 337 F.3d at 36.\n     9\n      \"Importantly, . . . authority to sign checks, without more,\nis a weak pillar on which to rest a liability determination that a\nperson is properly subject to a . . . penalty under section 6672.\"\nVinick, 205 F.3d at 10 (internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted). A \"court must look at the check-signing authority in the\ncontext of financial control.\" Id.\n\n                                -10-\n\f\"because [they] identif[y] most readily the person who could have\n\npaid the taxes, but chose not to do so.\"                  Id. at 9.\n\n               To act willfully under § 6672, one \"must have some\n\nknowledge of failure or risk of failure to remit the employment\n\ntaxes.\" Cooper, 60 F.3d at 1532; see Lubetzky, 2004 WL 2997888, at\n\n*3; Stuart, 337 F.3d at 36.\n\n               2.      26 U.S.C. § 7430\n\n               While   §   6672    imposes      liability     for     unpaid   taxes,\n\n§ 7430(a) establishes that an individual wrongly deemed liable\n\nunder § 6672 for unpaid taxes may recover both his administrative\n\nand litigation costs.          Section 7430(a) provides:\n\n               In any administrative or court proceeding\n               which is brought by or against the United\n               States in connection with the determination,\n               collection, or refund of any tax, interest, or\n               penalty . . . , the prevailing party may be\n               awarded a judgment or a settlement for--\n                      (1) reasonable administrative costs\n               incurred    in     connection     with    such\n               administrative proceeding within the [IRS],\n               and\n                      (2)   reasonable    litigation    costs\n               incurred in connection with such court\n               proceeding.\n\nThus,     to   be   eligible      for   an   award   of    administrative      costs,\n\nlitigation costs, or both, an individual must establish that he is\n\na \"prevailing party.\"10           26 U.S.C. § 7430(a).        An individual is a\n\n\n     10\n      An individual must also meet a number of additional\nrequirements that we need not address to decide this case. See,\ne.g., 26 U.S.C. §§ 7430(b)(1) (\"A judgement for reasonable\nlitigation costs shall not be awarded . . . unless . . . the\nprevailing party has exhausted the administrative remedies\n\n                                         -11-\n\f\"prevailing party\" if he \"has substantially prevailed with respect\n\nto the amount in controversy[] or . . . the most significant issue\n\nor set of issues presented,\" 26 U.S.C. § 7430(c)(4)(A)(i), and his\n\n\"net worth did not exceed $2,000,000 at the time the civil action\n\nwas   filed,\"         28    U.S.C.   §     2412(d)(2)(B);   see   26   U.S.C.\n\n§ 7430(c)(4)(A)(ii).        However, even if these requirements are met,\n\nan individual \"shall not be treated as the prevailing party . . .\n\nif the United States establishes that [its] position . . . in the\n\nproceeding      was        substantially      justified.\"         26   U.S.C.\n\n§ 7430(c)(4)(B)(i).11\n\n           The government's position in an administrative proceeding\n\nis its \"position . . . as of the earlier of . . . the date of the\n\nreceipt by the taxpayer of the notice of the decision of the [IRS]\n\nOffice of Appeals, or . . . the date of the notice of deficiency.\"12\n\n\navailable . . . within the [IRS].\"), 7430(b)(3) (\"No award for\nreasonable litigation and administrative costs may be made . . .\nwith respect to any portion of the administrative or court\nproceeding during which the prevailing party has unreasonably\nprotracted such proceeding.\").\n      11\n      The government's \"position . . . shall be presumed not to be\nsubstantially justified if the [IRS] did not follow its applicable\npublished guidance in the administrative proceeding.\" 26 U.S.C.\n§ 7430(c)(4)(B)(ii).\n      12\n      The date of the notice of deficiency is the date on which the\nIRS formally assesses the penalty for nonpayment, not the date on\nwhich it issues its proposed assessment.        Compare 26 U.S.C.\n§ 7430(c)(7)(B) (referring to \"the date of the notice of\ndeficiency\") with 26 U.S.C. § 7430(c)(2) (referring to \"the date of\nthe notice of deficiency\" and \"the date on which the first letter\nof proposed deficiency which allows the taxpayer an opportunity for\nadministrative review in the [IRS] Office of Appeals is sent\").\n\n                                     -12-\n\f26 U.S.C. § 7430(c)(7)(B). The government's position in a judicial\n\nproceeding is its \"position . . . at the onset of the litigation,\"\n\nNalle v. Comm'r of Internal Revenue, 55 F.3d 189, 191 (5th Cir.\n\n1995), and at \"each [subsequent] stage of the case,\" Huffman v.\n\nComm'r of Internal Revenue, 978 F.2d 1139, 1148 (9th Cir. 1992).\n\nA \"position . . . is substantially justified if it has a reasonable\n\nbasis in both law and fact, a determination made on a case by case\n\nbasis.\"   Bisbee, 245 F.3d at 1007.    The government's loss in the\n\nunderlying litigation is not determinative of whether its position\n\nwas substantially justified.      See, e.g., Nalle, 55 F.3d at 192\n\n(\"[I]f at the onset of litigation the error was not obvious, the\n\n[government] may still be substantially justified in defending an\n\nultimately unsuccessful position.\").\n\nB.        Application of Facts to Law\n\n          Paul claims that the district court erred when it denied\n\nhis motion to recover the administrative and litigation costs he\n\nincurred after the IRS initially took the position that he was\n\nliable for Focus' unpaid taxes.    The government, however, insists\n\nthat the district court correctly found that because the government\n\nwas substantially justified in rejecting Paul's challenge to the\n\nproposed assessment and in pursuing the litigation, Paul should not\n\nbe treated as a prevailing party under § 7430 and, therefore,\n\n\n\n\n                               -13-\n\fshould not be permitted to recover his costs.13          Thus, the question\n\nfor us is did the district court abuse its discretion in finding\n\nthat the government was substantially justified in taking, and in\n\npursuing, the position that, for the first three quarters of 1992,\n\nPaul was a responsible person who willfully failed to pay Focus'\n\ntaxes and, therefore, was liable for its tax liabilities under §\n\n6672.\n\n            1.        Administrative Costs\n\n            On the record before us, we cannot say that the district\n\ncourt     abused    its   discretion     in   finding   that   the   IRS   was\n\nsubstantially justified when it initially took the position that\n\nPaul was liable for Focus' tax deficiencies for the quarters in\n\nquestion.14        At that point, the IRS knew that Paul had full\n\nauthority to disburse funds from Focus' bank accounts for the first\n\ntwo quarters in question and at least part of the third.15                  In\n\n\n     13\n      The government concedes that Paul has met the other\nprevailing party prerequisites. See 26 U.S.C. §§ 7430(c)(4)(A)(i),\n7430(c)(4)(A)(ii).\n     14\n      The date the IRS Office of Appeals rejected Paul's challenge\nto the proposed assessment, June 28, 1996, is the relevant date for\npurposes of this appeal. See supra note 12 and accompanying text.\n     15\n      Even if, at the time in question, the IRS possessed evidence\nthat Paul had relinquished his signatory authority during the third\nquarter (and it is not clear from the record that it did), that\nwould not change our view as to the reasonableness of the district\ncourt's finding. See Brown v. United States, 591 F.2d 1136, 1140\n(5th Cir. 1979) (\"[A]n . . . employee need not be responsible for\nthe payment of withholding taxes at the end of the quarter in order\nto be a responsible person for that quarter.\") (citing Slodov, 436\nU.S. at 247).\n\n                                       -14-\n\faddition, it knew that Paul had signed many of the checks Focus had\n\nissued during those quarters.              Furthermore, the IRS did not then\n\npossess reliable evidence that Paul lacked authority to pay Focus'\n\ntax liabilities.         Although, prior to the point at which the IRS\n\ntook its position, Pottle had provided the agency with a statement\n\nin which he affirmed that he and George had complete authority over\n\nFocus' finances, Pottle had neglected to mention (and the IRS was\n\naware)     that,   for    much    of    the    relevant      period,      Paul    had    the\n\nauthority to disburse, and had disbursed, significant sums from\n\nFocus' bank accounts. Thus, Pottle's statement was of questionable\n\nprobative value.         The denial of Paul's request for administrative\n\ncosts is affirmed.         Cf. Bisbee, 245 F.3d at 1007 (noting that the\n\nIRS's position \"is not reasonable where the agency is possessed of\n\n[compelling] evidence indicating that the [individual] had no\n\nauthority to pay taxes\"); Cooper, 60 F.3d at 1531-32 (same).\n\n             2.      Litigation Costs\n\n             Similarly,        the     district      court    did        not    abuse    its\n\ndiscretion when it decided that the government was substantially\n\njustified in (1) taking the position that Paul was liable under\n\n§ 6672 for Focus' tax liabilities at the onset of the litigation\n\nand   (2)   refusing      to     abandon      that   position       at    the    close    of\n\ndiscovery.16\n\n\n      16\n      We make this determination assuming that, both at the onset\nof litigation and at the close of discovery, the government\npossessed evidence that Paul had relinquished his signatory\n\n                                           -15-\n\f          At the onset of litigation, the information available to\n\nthe government was the same as that which was available to the IRS\n\nwhen it initially took its position. The government knew that Paul\n\nhad authority to disburse, and had disbursed, funds from Focus'\n\naccounts during the relevant quarters, and it did not then possess\n\nreliable evidence that Paul (1) lacked the authority to decide\n\nwhich of Focus' creditors were to be paid, see Vinick, 205 F.3d at\n\n8 (To be a responsible person, one must have \"the actual authority\n\n. . . to pay the taxes owed.\"), or (2) was not aware of Focus' tax\n\nliabilities, see Cooper, 60 F.3d at 1532 (To act willfully, one\n\n\"must have some knowledge of failure or risk of failure to remit\n\nthe employment taxes.\"). Cf. Sharp v. United States, 145 F.3d 994,\n\n996 (8th Cir. 1998) (holding that the government's position was not\n\nsubstantially justified because \"[n]ot only is it clear that\n\n[taxpayer] did not have the authority to pay the withholding taxes,\n\nit is also clear from the record that the government was aware of\n\nthe limitations on [taxpayer's] authority before it filed its\n\ncounterclaim\").     Thus,   the    district   court    did    not   abuse   its\n\ndiscretion   in   finding   that   the    government    was    substantially\n\njustified in initially pursuing the litigation, particularly given\n\nthat it was Paul's burden to prove that he was not a responsible\n\n\nauthority during the third quarter. See cases cited supra note 15.\nFurthermore, we recognize that it is not entirely clear that Paul\nstated the second of the two issues in the accompanying text to the\ndistrict court.    Nevertheless, for purposes of this appeal, we\nassume that the second issue was clearly stated.\n\n                                   -16-\n\fperson and did not meet the willfulness requirement, see Stuart,\n\n337 F.3d at 36.\n\n            Although the government possessed additional information\n\nby the close of discovery--the deposition testimony of Paul and\n\nPottle and Paul's affidavit, we do not think the district court\n\nabused     its   discretion   in   finding   that   the   government   was\n\nsubstantially justified in continuing to pursue the litigation. At\n\nhis deposition, Paul stated that, throughout much of the relevant\n\nperiod, he could pay Focus' smaller bills without first obtaining\n\napproval from Pottle or George.       Although Paul said that he could\n\nnot pay Focus' larger bills without prior approval, he acknowledged\n\nthat there were no \"specific . . . criteria that [were] employed\n\n[to distinguish the smaller bills from the larger ones].\"              Paul\n\nalso testified that he was involved in daily meetings with Pottle\n\nand George during which it was decided which of Focus' bills would\n\nbe paid.    And, Paul admitted that he was aware that Focus was not\n\npaying its taxes. Not only did Paul's statements fail to establish\n\nthat he was not a responsible person of Focus,17 they suggested that\n\nhis actions would satisfy § 6672's willfulness requirement.\n\n\n     17\n      Paul appears to argue that his testimony that \"as the\nfinancial situation grew tighter, then virtually any bill and any\ncreditor would have been paid in consultation with [] Pottle\" made\nit clear that he was not a responsible person. But, all Paul said\nwas that he paid \"virtually any bill and any creditor . . . in\nconsultation with [] Pottle\" (emphasis added); he did not say that\nhe could pay bills only if Pottle directed him to do so, and he did\nnot say that he had no influence over the decision regarding which\ncreditors would be paid and which would not.\n\n                                   -17-\n\f              Pottle's deposition testimony does not undermine the\n\ndistrict court's finding of substantial justification.                 Although\n\nPottle testified that Paul did not have the authority to make\n\nindependent spending decisions, Pottle was not responsible for the\n\nday-to-day operations of, and spent little time in, the office in\n\nwhich Paul worked.           Therefore, it was not evident that Pottle\n\npossessed sufficient actual knowledge to testify as to the scope of\n\nPaul's authority. Moreover, Pottle's testimony about the extent of\n\nPaul's authority was inconsistent with Paul's, and as a result, it\n\nwas not unreasonable for the government to seek clarification of\n\nPaul's status within Focus at trial.           Cf. Barton v. United States,\n\n988 F.2d 58, 60 (8th Cir. 1993) (\"[T]he Government could not\n\nreasonably rely on [limited management and supervisory powers and\n\nrestricted signature authority] in the face of uncontradicted\n\nevidence that [taxpayer] had no authority over tax matters.\").\n\n              Similarly, the existence of Paul's affidavit does not\n\nundermine the district court's finding. While Paul may have stated\n\nin the affidavit that he had no actual authority to pay Focus'\n\ntaxes,   he    failed   to    explain    why   his   representations    in   the\n\naffidavit were inconsistent with his deposition testimony, and he\n\nprovided no evidentiary support for those representations.                Thus,\n\nthe government was entitled to test Paul's credibility at trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -18-\n\f            In view of all of the above, the district court's denial\n\nof Paul's request for litigation costs is affirmed.18\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     18\n      As a final matter, Paul argues that because the IRS failed\nto follow \"applicable published guidance,\" IRS Policy Statement P-\n5-60, a presumption should have arisen that the government's\nposition was not substantially justified.          See 26 U.S.C.\n§ 7430(c)(4)(B)(ii).      The government maintains that Policy\nStatement P-5-60 was not \"applicable published guidance\" within the\nmeaning of § 7430(c)(4)(B)(ii). We need not decide that issue,\nbecause the IRS's position was not inconsistent with the Policy\nStatement, which provides:\n     Responsibility is a matter of status, duty, and\n     authority.   Those performing ministerial acts without\n     exercising independent judgment will not be deemed\n     responsible.\n     In general, non-owner employees of the business entity,\n     who act solely under the dominion and control of others,\n     and who are not in a position to make independent\n     decisions on behalf of the business entity, will not be\n     asserted the trust fund recovery penalty.\nAt the relevant stages of the case, it was unclear whether Paul had\nthe authority to pay the IRS and to what degree Paul was involved\nin the decision-making process concerning the payment of Focus'\ncreditors. Therefore, Paul was not entitled to the presumption,\nand consequently, the district court did not err in refusing to\napply it.\n\n                                -19-\n\f",

The    Internal   Revenue\n\nService (\"IRS\"), acting pursuant to 26 U.S.C. § 6672, assessed a\n\npenalty against Appellant Paul Jean (\"Paul\"), an employee of Focus\n\nFinancial Services (\"Focus\"), for unpaid income and social security\n\ntaxes withheld from the wages of Focus' employees in 1992.

Initially, Focus\n\nprovided debt collection services out of an office in Plymouth,\n\nMassachusetts. By 1987, Focus also had a credit reporting business\n\nin Lynn, Massachusetts.2     Notwithstanding this expansion, even\n\nafter 1987, all of the company's bills were paid out of its\n\nPlymouth office.\n\n          In 1987, Pottle hired George's son, Paul, to work part-\n\ntime as a bookkeeper for Focus.          Paul was given full signatory\n\nauthority over Focus' bank accounts; that is, he had the power to\n\ndisburse funds from the company's accounts.3         Paul, who worked in\n\nthe Plymouth office, signed many of the checks issued by Focus,\n\nincluding checks issued to cover Focus' tax liabilities.\n\n          Sometime   in    1991,     Focus   began    having   financial\n\ndifficulties, which culminated in its failure to pay the IRS taxes\n\nthat had been withheld from its employees' wages for the first\n\nthree quarters of 1992.     During those quarters, however, Focus\n\ncontinued to pay its employees and other creditors.\n\n          Paul signed most of the checks that Focus issued in the\n\nfirst two quarters of 1992--he signed 114 checks, transferring\n\n$284,353.22 to Focus' creditors, of which $202,360.96 was paid to\n\ncreditors other than the IRS.      On August 2, 1992, during the third\n\n\n     2\n      Focus ceased operating the credit reporting business and\nclosed its Lynn office in 1991.\n     3\n      Paul was listed as an authorized signatory on the bank cards\nfor Focus' accounts.\n\n                                   -3-\n\fquarter, Paul relinquished his signatory authority; apparently, he\n\nfeared being held liable for Focus' failure to pay the IRS.\n\n           On December 20, 1994, pursuant to 26 U.S.C. § 6672, the\n\nIRS   proposed   to   assess   Paul     for   Focus'   unpaid    withholding\n\nobligations.     The IRS viewed Paul as a \"responsible person\" of\n\nFocus who had willfully failed to pay the company's taxes.             Prior\n\nto the issuance of the proposed assessment, in May 1994, Pottle\n\nfiled with the IRS a statement in which he averred that he and\n\nGeorge were the only persons with authority over Focus' finances.\n\nPottle failed to mention that, during much of the relevant period,\n\nPaul had been authorized to disburse, and had in fact disbursed,\n\nmoney from Focus' bank accounts.              Paul appealed the proposed\n\nassessment to the IRS Office of Appeals on January 12, 1995.              On\n\nJune 28, 1996, the Office of Appeals rejected Paul's challenge.\n\n           On August 12, 1996, the IRS assessed a penalty against\n\nPaul in the amount of $31,825.66 for Focus' tax liabilities for the\n\nfirst three quarters of 1992, the period from January 1, 1992 to\n\nSeptember 30, 1992. The IRS made a like assessment against George.\n\nPaul and George, on November 16, 1999, each paid the IRS $84.00 and\n\nfiled refund claims with the agency.          The claims were denied, and\n\non June 30, 2000, Paul and George sued the IRS in district court\n\nfor refunds of the sums paid and an abatement of the balance of the\n\nassessment.      In   response,   the   government     filed   counterclaims\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fagainst Paul and George for the portion of the assessment that\n\nremained unpaid.4\n\n          During discovery, Pottle and Paul were deposed.5          At his\n\ndeposition, Paul stated that he had the authority to write checks\n\nto pay Focus' smaller bills, \"certainly [invoices] under $100, for\n\nexample,\" without first obtaining approval from Pottle or George.\n\nHowever, he said that he did not have the authority to pay Focus'\n\n\"larger invoices--telephone bills, for example,\" without obtaining\n\nprior approval.     Paul testified that there were no \"specific . . .\n\ncriteria that [were] employed [to distinguish the smaller bills\n\nfrom the larger ones].\"\n\n          In addition, Paul acknowledged that once Focus began\n\nexperiencing   financial   difficulties,   he   participated   in   daily\n\nmeetings with Pottle and George during which Focus' financial\n\nobligations were discussed and it was decided which bills were to\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      It appears that, in 1998, the IRS reduced the amount of the\nassessment against Paul because Pottle had paid Focus' taxes for\nthe third quarter of 1992. Accordingly, the government insists\nthat it never sought to collect third quarter taxes from Paul in\nconnection with the litigation in question. Because neither the\nallegations in the government's counterclaim nor its subsequent\nbehavior in the litigation rendered its position as to the third\nquarter taxes clear, in deciding the issues raised in this appeal,\nwe assume that the IRS sought to collect third quarter taxes from\nPaul.\n     5\n      George was also deposed, but neither party has identified his\ndeposition as relevant to this appeal.\n\n                                  -5-\n\fbe paid.6   The extent of Paul's involvement in the meetings and in\n\nthe ultimate decision as to which creditors were to be paid is\n\nunclear from the deposition transcript.     Paul also admitted that,\n\nin 1992, he was aware that Focus had not paid its taxes but that it\n\nwas paying its employees' salaries and other obligations.\n\n            Pottle testified at his deposition that Paul lacked the\n\nauthority to make independent spending decisions. But, Pottle also\n\nstated that, at all relevant times, George was responsible for the\n\nday-to-day operations of the company's business in Plymouth.    And,\n\nPottle said that he rarely visited the Plymouth office after the\n\nfirst few years of Focus' existence.\n\n            Following the close of discovery, Paul filed a motion for\n\nsummary judgment in which he asserted that the undisputed facts\n\nestablished that he was not a person responsible for the payment of\n\ntaxes by Focus because he never had the authority to decide which\n\nof Focus' creditors were to be paid.    At the same time, Paul filed\n\nan affidavit in which he maintained that he was nothing more than\n\na clerical employee of Focus; he insisted that he:      (1) \"did not\n\nhave the authority . . . to determine which creditors were to be\n\npaid\"; (2) \"was not an officer, shareholder or director\"; (3) \"was\n\ncontrolled by [] Pottle\"; (4) \"did not have the actual ability to\n\n\n\n\n     6\n      Paul testified that \"as the financial situation grew tighter,\nthen virtually any bill and any creditor would have been paid in\nconsultation with [] Pottle.\"\n\n                                 -6-\n\festablish financial policies or procedures\"; and (5) \"did not have\n\nthe ability to hire or fire employees.\"\n\n          The government opposed the motion, arguing that the scope\n\nof Paul's authority to determine which of Focus' creditors were to\n\nbe paid was in dispute.    The government pointed out that, at his\n\ndeposition, Paul testified that he had the authority to pay certain\n\ncreditors without prior approval and participated in daily meetings\n\nwith Pottle and George concerning Focus' financial obligations.\n\n          The district court allowed the motion in part and denied\n\nit in part.   It concluded that, for the period from January 1, 1992\n\nthrough August 1, 1992 (the first, the second, and part of the\n\nthird quarter), there was a genuine dispute as to whether Paul had\n\nthe requisite decision-making authority to render him a person\n\nresponsible for payment of taxes by Focus.         By contrast, it\n\nreasoned that Paul's relinquishment of his check-signing authority\n\non August 2, 1992 left him in a position where, after that date, he\n\nclearly lacked authority to pay taxes.     Therefore, the district\n\ncourt allowed the motion as to the period from August 2, 1992\n\nthrough September 30, 1992 and denied it as to the period from\n\nJanuary 1, 1992 through August 1, 1992.\n\n          After the close of evidence at trial, Paul filed a motion\n\nfor a directed verdict, which the district court allowed.      Paul\n\nthen moved for administrative and litigation costs under 26 U.S.C.\n\n§ 7430.   The government opposed the motion, claiming that it was\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fsubstantially justified in taking the position that Paul was liable\n\nfor Focus' tax deficiencies.     The district court agreed with the\n\ngovernment and denied the motion.      Paul now seeks review of that\n\ndenial.\n\n                          II.    Discussion\n\n           We have not previously addressed the question of what\n\nstandard of review applies to a district court's ruling on a motion\n\nfor costs pursuant to 26 U.S.C. § 7430.       We will follow our sister\n\ncircuits and review the district court's determination that Paul\n\nwas not entitled to costs under § 7430 for abuse of discretion.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v.

Application of Facts to Law\n\n          Paul claims that the district court erred when it denied\n\nhis motion to recover the administrative and litigation costs he\n\nincurred after the IRS initially took the position that he was\n\nliable for Focus' unpaid taxes.    The government, however, insists\n\nthat the district court correctly found that because the government\n\nwas substantially justified in rejecting Paul's challenge to the\n\nproposed assessment and in pursuing the litigation, Paul should not\n\nbe treated as a prevailing party under § 7430 and, therefore,\n\n\n\n\n                               -13-\n\fshould not be permitted to recover his costs.13          Thus, the question\n\nfor us is did the district court abuse its discretion in finding\n\nthat the government was substantially justified in taking, and in\n\npursuing, the position that, for the first three quarters of 1992,\n\nPaul was a responsible person who willfully failed to pay Focus'\n\ntaxes and, therefore, was liable for its tax liabilities under §\n\n6672.\n\n            1.        Administrative Costs\n\n            On the record before us, we cannot say that the district\n\ncourt     abused    its   discretion     in   finding   that   the   IRS   was\n\nsubstantially justified when it initially took the position that\n\nPaul was liable for Focus' tax deficiencies for the quarters in\n\nquestion.14        At that point, the IRS knew that Paul had full\n\nauthority to disburse funds from Focus' bank accounts for the first\n\ntwo quarters in question and at least part of the third.15                  In\n\n\n     13\n      The government concedes that Paul has met the other\nprevailing party prerequisites. See 26 U.S.C. §§ 7430(c)(4)(A)(i),\n7430(c)(4)(A)(ii).\n     14\n      The date the IRS Office of Appeals rejected Paul's challenge\nto the proposed assessment, June 28, 1996, is the relevant date for\npurposes of this appeal. See supra note 12 and accompanying text.\n     15\n      Even if, at the time in question, the IRS possessed evidence\nthat Paul had relinquished his signatory authority during the third\nquarter (and it is not clear from the record that it did), that\nwould not change our view as to the reasonableness of the district\ncourt's finding.

Furthermore, the IRS did not then\n\npossess reliable evidence that Paul lacked authority to pay Focus'\n\ntax liabilities.         Although, prior to the point at which the IRS\n\ntook its position, Pottle had provided the agency with a statement\n\nin which he affirmed that he and George had complete authority over\n\nFocus' finances, Pottle had neglected to mention (and the IRS was\n\naware)     that,   for    much    of    the    relevant      period,      Paul    had    the\n\nauthority to disburse, and had disbursed, significant sums from\n\nFocus' bank accounts. Thus, Pottle's statement was of questionable\n\nprobative value.         The denial of Paul's request for administrative\n\ncosts is affirmed.         Cf.

Litigation Costs\n\n             Similarly,        the     district      court    did        not    abuse    its\n\ndiscretion when it decided that the government was substantially\n\njustified in (1) taking the position that Paul was liable under\n\n§ 6672 for Focus' tax liabilities at the onset of the litigation\n\nand   (2)   refusing      to     abandon      that   position       at    the    close    of\n\ndiscovery.16\n\n\n      16\n      We make this determination assuming that, both at the onset\nof litigation and at the close of discovery, the government\npossessed evidence that Paul had relinquished his signatory\n\n                                           -15-\n\f          At the onset of litigation, the information available to\n\nthe government was the same as that which was available to the IRS\n\nwhen it initially took its position. The government knew that Paul\n\nhad authority to disburse, and had disbursed, funds from Focus'\n\naccounts during the relevant quarters, and it did not then possess\n\nreliable evidence that Paul (1) lacked the authority to decide\n\nwhich of Focus' creditors were to be paid, see Vinick, 205 F.3d at\n\n8 (To be a responsible person, one must have \"the actual authority\n\n. . . to pay the taxes owed.\"), or (2) was not aware of Focus' tax\n\nliabilities, see Cooper, 60 F.3d at 1532 (To act willfully, one\n\n\"must have some knowledge of failure or risk of failure to remit\n\nthe employment taxes.\"). Cf. Sharp v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">994</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n996 (8th Cir. 1998) (holding that the government's position was not\n\nsubstantially justified because \"[n]ot only is it clear that\n\n[taxpayer] did not have the authority to pay the withholding taxes,\n\nit is also clear from the record that the government was aware of\n\nthe limitations on [taxpayer's] authority before it filed its\n\ncounterclaim\").     Thus,   the    district   court    did    not   abuse   its\n\ndiscretion   in   finding   that   the    government    was    substantially\n\njustified in initially pursuing the litigation, particularly given\n\nthat it was Paul's burden to prove that he was not a responsible\n\n\nauthority during the third quarter. See cases cited supra note 15.\nFurthermore, we recognize that it is not entirely clear that Paul\nstated the second of the two issues in the accompanying text to the\ndistrict court.    Nevertheless, for purposes of this appeal, we\nassume that the second issue was clearly stated.\n\n                                   -16-\n\fperson and did not meet the willfulness requirement, see Stuart,\n\n337 F.3d at 36.\n\n            Although the government possessed additional information\n\nby the close of discovery--the deposition testimony of Paul and\n\nPottle and Paul's affidavit, we do not think the district court\n\nabused     its   discretion   in   finding   that   the   government   was\n\nsubstantially justified in continuing to pursue the litigation. At\n\nhis deposition, Paul stated that, throughout much of the relevant\n\nperiod, he could pay Focus' smaller bills without first obtaining\n\napproval from Pottle or George.       Although Paul said that he could\n\nnot pay Focus' larger bills without prior approval, he acknowledged\n\nthat there were no \"specific . . . criteria that [were] employed\n\n[to distinguish the smaller bills from the larger ones].\"              Paul\n\nalso testified that he was involved in daily meetings with Pottle\n\nand George during which it was decided which of Focus' bills would\n\nbe paid.    And, Paul admitted that he was aware that Focus was not\n\npaying its taxes. Not only did Paul's statements fail to establish\n\nthat he was not a responsible person of Focus,17 they suggested that\n\nhis actions would satisfy § 6672's willfulness requirement.\n\n\n     17\n      Paul appears to argue that his testimony that \"as the\nfinancial situation grew tighter, then virtually any bill and any\ncreditor would have been paid in consultation with [] Pottle\" made\nit clear that he was not a responsible person. But, all Paul said\nwas that he paid \"virtually any bill and any creditor . . . in\nconsultation with [] Pottle\" (emphasis added); he did not say that\nhe could pay bills only if Pottle directed him to do so, and he did\nnot say that he had no influence over the decision regarding which\ncreditors would be paid and which would not.\n\n                                   -17-\n\f              Pottle's deposition testimony does not undermine the\n\ndistrict court's finding of substantial justification.                 Although\n\nPottle testified that Paul did not have the authority to make\n\nindependent spending decisions, Pottle was not responsible for the\n\nday-to-day operations of, and spent little time in, the office in\n\nwhich Paul worked.           Therefore, it was not evident that Pottle\n\npossessed sufficient actual knowledge to testify as to the scope of\n\nPaul's authority. Moreover, Pottle's testimony about the extent of\n\nPaul's authority was inconsistent with Paul's, and as a result, it\n\nwas not unreasonable for the government to seek clarification of\n\nPaul's status within Focus at trial.           Cf. Barton v. United States,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"601904\"><a href=\"/opinion/601904/john-r-barton-v-united-states-of-america-ray-b-mcmartin-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 60 (8th Cir. 1993) (\"[T]he Government could not\n\nreasonably rely on [limited management and supervisory powers and\n\nrestricted signature authority] in the face of uncontradicted\n\nevidence that [taxpayer] had no authority over tax matters.\").\n\n              Similarly, the existence of Paul's affidavit does not\n\nundermine the district court's finding. While Paul may have stated\n\nin the affidavit that he had no actual authority to pay Focus'\n\ntaxes,   he    failed   to    explain    why   his   representations    in   the\n\naffidavit were inconsistent with his deposition testimony, and he\n\nprovided no evidentiary support for those representations.                Thus,\n\nthe government was entitled to test Paul's credibility at trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -18-\n\f            In view of all of the above, the district court's denial\n\nof Paul's request for litigation costs is affirmed.18\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     18\n      As a final matter, Paul argues that because the IRS failed\nto follow \"applicable published guidance,\" IRS Policy Statement P-\n5-60, a presumption should have arisen that the government's\nposition was not substantially justified.          See 26 U.S.C.\n§ 7430(c)(4)(B)(ii).      The government maintains that Policy\nStatement P-5-60 was not \"applicable published guidance\" within the\nmeaning of § 7430(c)(4)(B)(ii). We need not decide that issue,\nbecause the IRS's position was not inconsistent with the Policy\nStatement, which provides:\n     Responsibility is a matter of status, duty, and\n     authority.   Those performing ministerial acts without\n     exercising independent judgment will not be deemed\n     responsible.\n     In general, non-owner employees of the business entity,\n     who act solely under the dominion and control of others,\n     and who are not in a position to make independent\n     decisions on behalf of the business entity, will not be\n     asserted the trust fund recovery penalty.\nAt the relevant stages of the case, it was unclear whether Paul had\nthe authority to pay the IRS and to what degree Paul was involved\nin the decision-making process concerning the payment of Focus'\ncreditors. Therefore, Paul was not entitled to the presumption,\nand consequently, the district court did not err in refusing to\napply it.\n\n                                -19-\n\f</pre>",
