TAYLOR,\n\n                       Defendant, Appellee.\n\n\n       ON REMAND FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                         Lynch, Chief Judge,\n               Newman* and Torruella, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     John A. Capin, Assistant United States Attorney, Michael J.\nSullivan, United States Attorney, and Paul G. Levenson, Assistant\nUnited States Attorney, on supplemental brief for appellant.\n     Bruce T. Macdonald on supplemental brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           July 9, 2008\n\n\n\n\n*\n    Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f            TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge. Talmus Taylor was sentenced to\n\none year in a halfway house, five years of probation, and a $10,000\n\nfine, for aiding and assisting in the preparation of false tax\n\nreturns, in violation of 26 U.S.C. § 7206(2).          Following an appeal\n\nby   the   Government,   we   vacated   the   sentence   as    substantively\n\nunreasonable and remanded to the district court.                 See United\n\nStates v. Taylor, 499 F.3d 94 (1st Cir. 2007), vacated, 128 S. Ct.\n\n878 (2008).     The case returns to us on remand from the Supreme\n\nCourt for further consideration in light of Gall v. United States,\n\n128 S. Ct. 586 (2007).\n\n            The Court's decision in Gall, combined with its decisions\n\nin Kimbrough v. United States, 128 S. Ct. 558 (2007), and Rita v.\n\nUnited States, 127 S. Ct. 2456 (2007), makes clear that in the\n\npost-Booker world, district judges are empowered with considerable\n\ndiscretion in sentencing, as long as the sentence is generally\n\nreasonable and the court has followed the proper procedures.              In\n\naccordance    with   these    decisions,      our   recent    opinions   have\n\nelaborated on the broad scope of this discretion.                See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Martin, 520 F.3d 87 (1st Cir. 2008); see also\n\nUnited States v. Rodríguez, 527 F.3d 221 (1st Cir. 2008); United\n\nStates v. Politano, 522 F.3d 69 (1st Cir. 2008).               Recently, in\n\nanother sentencing case vacated by Gall, we noted this expanded\n\ndiscretion and concluded that the fairest course of action was to\n\nprovide the district court the opportunity to reconsider its\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fsentence in view of the Supreme Court's elucidation of sentencing\n\nprocedures, as well as some of the concerns we had expressed in the\n\nprior opinion.   See United States v. Tom, No. 07-1074, 2008 WL\n\n1886608 (1st Cir. Apr. 30, 2008) (unpublished).       We think that\n\ncourse appropriate under the circumstances here as well.\n\n          In so doing, we first reiterate some of the important\n\nsentencing principles underscored in all of these recent decisions.\n\nAs clearly outlined in Gall, we review a district court's sentence\n\nunder a deferential abuse of discretion standard, which involves\n\nboth a procedural and a substantive inquiry.    See Gall, 128 S. Ct.\n\nat 597; see also Politano, 522 F.3d at 72.     This deference arises\n\nfrom the advantages inherent in the district court's position: \"a\n\nsuperior coign of vantage, greater familiarity with the individual\n\ncase, the opportunity to see and hear the principals and the\n\ntestimony at first hand, and the cumulative experience garnered\n\nthrough the sheer number of district court sentencing proceedings\n\nthat take place day by day.\"   Martin, 520 F.3d at 92.   Indeed, once\n\nthe district court has followed the proper procedures, our review\n\nof substantive reasonableness is highly discretionary.       See id.\n\n(\"[R]eversal will result if – and only if - the sentencing court's\n\nultimate determination falls outside the expansive boundaries of\n\nthat universe [of reasonableness].\").\n\n          Yet, along with this increased discretion to fashion an\n\nappropriate sentence goes an accompanying \"need for an increased\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fdegree of justification commensurate with an increased degree of\n\nvariance.\"      Martin, 520 F.3d at 91.              To be clear, there is no\n\nstrict    formula     for   determining      the    bounds     of   an   appropriate\n\nsentence, but there is \"a certain 'sliding scale' effect [that]\n\nlurks    in   the    penumbra   of    modern      federal   sentencing     law;    the\n\nguidelines     are    the   starting     point     for   the   fashioning     of    an\n\nindividualized sentence, so a major deviation from them must 'be\n\nsupported by a more significant justification than a minor one.'\"\n\nId. (quoting Gall, 128 S. Ct. at 597).\n\n              In our prior review of the sentence in this case, we\n\nexpressed concern that the district court had failed to take all of\n\nthe 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) factors into account in fashioning the\n\ndefendant's entirely non-jail sentence for such a serious crime.\n\nOur   conclusion      was   not      based   on    any   requirement      that     the\n\njustification be \"proportional\" to the deviation or that the result\n\ncomply with a mathematic formula defining the outer bounds of\n\nreasonableness.        Rather, it was that in our view, the court's\n\nexplanations had failed to justify the overall result.\n\n              As in Tom, a ruling on the sentence based on the present\n\nrecord would not fully actualize Gall's effect in \"shed[ding]\n\nconsiderable light on the scope and extent of a district court's\n\ndiscretion under the now-advisory federal sentencing guidelines.\"\n\nMartin, 520 F.3d at 88.           Given the intervening cases which have\n\nfurther elucidated the district court's discretion in sentencing\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\f(as well as underscored the importance of the district court's\n\njustifications for that sentence), we think it best to remand to\n\nthe district court for reconsideration with the benefit of all of\n\nthese developments, as well as the concerns we expressed in our\n\nprior opinion.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -5-\n\f",
