Appellant Lahouari Haoud\n\nappeals from the Board of Immigration Appeals' (the \"Board\")\n\naffirmance without opinion of an Immigration Judge's order denying\n\nHaoud's claims for relief from removal under the Immigration and\n\nNationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101 et seq.         As the Board's decision\n\nprovides an inadequate basis for judicial review, we remand to the\n\nBoard for further proceedings.\n\nI. BACKGROUND\n\n           Haoud is a native and citizen of Algeria. He entered the\n\nUnited States on a six-month visa in 1995 and stayed unlawfully\n\nafter the expiration of the visa.         On December 30, 1999, the FBI\n\nand local police came to his home in East Boston, Massachusetts,\n\nand arrested him for carrying a fraudulent green card.                   Law\n\nenforcement     also   questioned   him   about      terrorist    activities.\n\nAlthough a criminal charge was never filed against Haoud, numerous\n\nnewspaper articles and television broadcasts linked him to the\n\ngeneral   terrorist    scare   on   the   eve   of    the   new   millennium,\n\nspecifically with regard to Algerians arrested in Boston who had\n\nbeen questioned about their connections with terrorist groups such\n\nas the Armed Islamic Group of Algeria (\"GIA\").\n\n           Because of the fraudulent green card and the fact that he\n\nhad overstayed his visa, Haoud was held at an INS detention center\n\nthroughout January 2000.        On March 24, 2000, he submitted an\n\napplication and supporting affidavit for asylum, withholding of\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fremoval under 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), withholding or deferral of\n\nremoval under Article 3 of the United Nations Convention Against\n\nTorture, and voluntary departure under 8 U.S.C. § 1229a.                              He\n\nclaimed that because his arrest for possessing a false green card\n\nhad generated local and nationwide publicity implying that he was\n\nassociated with an Algerian terrorist group, he feared persecution\n\nif he was returned to Algeria.           At his asylum hearing, in addition\n\nto    his   own   testimony,      documentation         of   his    arrest    and     the\n\nsubsequent media coverage, Haoud produced Dr. John Entelis, an\n\nexpert in Algerian politics from Fordham University, who testified\n\nthat because of the paranoid climate pervading Algerian society and\n\nits   government,       Haoud   would    be    in   danger    in    Algeria     as    the\n\ngovernment, knowing of the claims made against him in the United\n\nStates, would consider him a terrorist or enemy of the state.\n\n             The Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") denied all four of Haoud's\n\napplications.        He decided that Haoud's asylum application was\n\nuntimely     filed      and     that    he     failed    to    establish       changed\n\ncircumstances      to   excuse    that       untimeliness.         See 8     U.S.C.   §§\n\n1158(a)(2)(B) & (D).            Alternatively, the IJ found that Haoud's\n\napplication failed to demonstrate either past persecution or a\n\nwell-founded fear of future persecution based on a reasonable\n\npossibility that he would suffer harm in Algeria. The IJ explained\n\nthat Haoud could not use the media reports to \"manufacture an\n\n\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fasylum claim\" and that Dr. Entelis's testimony was too speculative\n\nto support the claim.\n\n             Shortly after the IJ made these determinations, the Board\n\ndecided a case, In re Amine Touarsi, A78 161 736 (BIA 12/28/2000),\n\ninvolving another Algerian man who was arrested in Boston the same\n\nnight as Haoud on the same suspicion of terrorism.        Although the IJ\n\ndenied Touarsi's asylum application, the Board on appeal reversed\n\nupon   concluding    that    Touarsi   had    \"a   well-founded   fear    of\n\npersecution in Algeria based on imputed political opinion.\"\n\n             Haoud timely appealed the IJ's decision to the Board. In\n\nhis appeal, Haoud raised Touarsi.          Notwithstanding that apparent\n\nprecedent, the Board affirmed the IJ's decision without opinion\n\nunder 9 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(4).\n\nII. DISCUSSION\n\n          On appeal, the parties raise three primary issues: (1)\n\nwhether we have jurisdiction to review the Board's decision; (2)\n\nwhether the IJ's decision was in error; and (3) whether the Board's\n\naffirmance     without   opinion   (AWO)     violated   the   Board's    own\n\nregulatory procedure.       Because we decide this appeal on issue (3),\n\nwe discuss issues (1) and (2) only as they bear on (3).\n\n             For a determination by the Board of Immigration Appeals\n\nof statutory eligibility for relief from deportation, we review\n\nquestions of law de novo.       See Civil v. INS, 140 F.3d 52, 54 (1st\n\nCir. 1998). While deference is given to an agency's interpretation\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fof   the     underlying   statute,   such   interpretation   must   be   \"in\n\naccordance with administrative law principles.\"        Debab v. INS, 163\n\nF.3d 21, 24 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\nA. Jurisdiction\n\n              The government contends that we lack jurisdiction to\n\nreview the IJ's denial of Haoud's asylum application because Haoud\n\nfailed to file his application within one year of his arrival in\n\nthe United States.1       The government also argues that under 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1158(a)(3), we are foreclosed from reviewing a determination that\n\nan alien failed to timely file an asylum application.2               Haoud\n\nconcedes that his asylum application was untimely, but argues that\n\nhe presented \"extraordinary circumstances\" that excuse the delay,\n\npursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(D).3\n\n\n      1\n          8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B) provides\n\n     Subject to subparagraph (D), paragraph (1) shall not apply to\nan alien unless the alien demonstrates by clear and convincing\nevidence that the application has been filed within 1 year after\nthe date of the alien's arrival in the United States.\n      2\n          8 U.S.C.   § 1158(a)(3) provides\n\n     No Court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination\nof the Attorney General under paragraph (2).\n      3\n          8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(D) provides\n\n     An application for asylum of an alien may be considered,\nnotwithstanding subparagraphs (B) and (C), if the alien\ndemonstrates to the satisfaction of the Attorney General either the\nexistence of changed circumstances which materially affect the\napplicant's eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances\nrelating to the delay in filing an application within the period\nspecified in subparagraph (B).\n\n                                     -5-\n\f             Our sister circuits agree that 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(3) bars\n\njudicial review of the Board's decision as to the timeliness of an\n\nasylum application.4    See Tarrawally v. Ashcroft, 338 F.3d 180, 185\n\n(3d Cir. 2003); Tsevegmid v. Ashcroft, 318 F.3d 1226, 1230 (10th\n\nCir. 2003); Fahim v. U.S. Attorney General, 278 F.3d 1216, 1217\n\n(11th Cir. 2002); Hakeem v. INS, 273 F.3d 812, 815 (9th Cir. 2001).\n\nThe Tenth Circuit in Tsevegmid explained:\n\n             This court generally has jurisdiction to review the\n             denial of any asylum request.          See 8 U.S.C. §\n             1252(a)(2)(B)(ii). . . . However, our jurisdiction to\n             review a [Board] determination on the timeliness of an\n             application for asylum is limited by statute. Section\n             1158(a)(3) expressly provides that the courts do not have\n             \"jurisdiction to review any determination\" on whether the\n             alien filed his application within a year of entry or\n             whether \"changed circumstances\" exist \"which materially\n             affect the applicant's eligibility for asylum or\n             extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in\n             filing an application.\"\n\n318 F.3d at 1229.\n\n             Though we concur that 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(3) could bar our\n\nreview of the IJ's determination of the timeliness of Haoud's\n\nasylum application, resolution of this issue does not dispose of\n\nthis case.    As discussed infra, we must determine on what grounds,\n\nwhether it be untimeliness or the merits of Haoud's asylum claim,\n\nthe Board affirmed the IJ's decision.      If the Board affirmed the\n\n\n\n     4\n      We are not similarly barred from reviewing the IJ's denial of\nHaoud's applications for withholding of removal, Convention Against\nTorture protection, and voluntary departure.        In his brief,\nhowever, Haoud has not asked us to do so, and we therefore refrain\nfrom discussing these issues.\n\n                                  -6-\n\fIJ's decision on the merits of Haoud's persecution claims, but\n\nrejected the IJ's conclusion as to the untimeliness and \"changed\n\ncircumstances\" issue, then we have jurisdiction over this appeal.\n\nB. The IJ's Decision\n\n          Haoud challenges the IJ's decision on the merits, arguing\n\nthat the IJ made erroneous conclusions of law that were neither\n\nharmless nor immaterial, and hence led to an incorrect result in\n\ndenying him asylum. Here the Board's decision effectively prevents\n\na reviewing court from knowing whether the affirmance of the IJ's\n\ndecision is reviewable or non-reviewable.            The AWO cannot be used\n\nto deny our legitimate review power if we are left without a proper\n\nbasis to determine our own jurisdiction or to evaluate the Board's\n\nown critical analysis, see infra.           Accordingly, we refrain at this\n\ntime from discussing the merits of the IJ's decision.\n\nC. The Board's Affirmance Without Opinion\n\n          The    Board   \"has   the   duty    to   follow   its   own   federal\n\nregulations.\"    Nelson v. INS, 232 F.3d 258, 262 (1st Cir. 2000);\n\nsee also Saakian v. INS, 252 F.3d 21, 25-27 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\nFailure to do so can result in the reversal of an agency order and\n\na new hearing.    Id.\n\n          Haoud argues that the Board failed to follow its own\n\nregulatory procedure when it issued the affirmance without opinion\n\n(AWO) in this case. The Attorney General adopted the AWO procedure\n\nat issue in 1999.       Rather than the usual three-member review, an\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fAWO allows for review of a case by a single member, who then\n\naffirms the IJ's decision with the statement, \"The Board affirms,\n\nwithout opinion, the result of the decision below.\"               8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1003.1(a)(7)(iii).      Unlike decisions rendered after review by a\n\nthree-member panel, a single Board member acting under 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1003.1(e)(4) is prohibited from explaining his decision on the\n\nmerits in an AWO.       Moreover, the regulation defines an AWO as a\n\nBoard approval of only the \"result reached in the decision below.\"\n\n8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(4). The AWO does not \"necessarily imply\n\napproval of all the reasoning\" of the IJ's decision, although it\n\ndoes signify the Board's conclusion that any errors were harmless\n\nor immaterial.    Id.    The Board member can issue an AWO only if he\n\ndetermines:\n\n          that the result reached in the decision under review was\n          correct; that any errors in the decision under review\n          were harmless or nonmaterial; and that (A) The issues on\n          appeal are squarely controlled by existing Board or\n          federal court precedent and do not involve the\n          application of precedent to a novel fact situation; or\n          (B) The factual and legal issues raised on appeal are not\n          so substantial that the case warrants the issuance of a\n          written opinion in the case.\n\nId.\n\n          The    government   strenuously   argues   that   the    Board's\n\ndecision to streamline a particular case is committed to agency\n\ndiscretion and is not subject to judicial review.       See 5 U.S.C. §\n\n701(a)(2); Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 830 (1985).            Where a\n\nlaw \"is drawn so that a court would have no meaningful standard\n\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fagainst which to judge the agency's exercise of discretion,\"\n\nCongress is assumed to have \"'committed' the decision making to the\n\nagency's judgment absolutely.\"           Heckler, 470 U.S. at 830-32.\n\n           Heckler involved a decision by the federal Food and Drug\n\nAdministration to refrain from instituting enforcement proceedings\n\nwith respect to drugs used for lethal injections to carry out the\n\ndeath   penalty.     The   Supreme       Court   found   the    FDA's   decision\n\nunreviewable    because    it    dealt   with    \"complicated     balancing   of\n\nfactors\" that were \"peculiarly within [the agency's] expertise.\"\n\nId. at 831.    The Court found no applicable legal standard or \"law\"\n\nin the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act against which a court\n\ncould legitimately review the FDA's decision not to commence\n\nenforcement proceedings.         See id.\n\n           Here, the Board's own regulation provides more than\n\nenough \"law\" by which a court could review the Board's decision to\n\nstreamline.    As 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(4) sets out supra, the Board\n\ncannot affirm an IJ's decision without opinion if the decision is\n\nincorrect, errors in the decision are not harmless or immaterial,\n\nthe issues on appeal are not squarely controlled by Board or\n\nfederal court precedent and involve the application of precedent to\n\na novel fact situation, or the issues raised on appeal are so\n\nsubstantial that a full written opinion is necessary.               Especially\n\nwhen the Board's review of an IJ's decision often hinges on Circuit\n\ncourt   precedent,   we    are    well-equipped,     both      statutorily    and\n\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fpractically, to review a decision to streamline.              See Goncalves v.\n\nReno, 144 F.3d 110, 127 (1st Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S.\n\n1004 (1999) (upholding judiciary's role in determining whether an\n\nagency's interpretation of a statute is permissible).\n\n            The government also postulates that the criteria of\n\n8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(4) were met here and that there was no harmful\n\nerror requiring review by a three-member panel of the Board.\n\nWithout an explanation of the reasons for the decision, we cannot\n\ndetermine whether the Board--applying the proper standards under 8\n\nC.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(4)--adequately and correctly evaluated each of\n\nthe criteria.       Here, we do not know which of the alternatives\n\noutlined in the regulation was applied to affirm the IJ's decision,\n\nwhich itself was based on multiple grounds.                 Put another way,\n\npresently, we have no way of knowing whether and how the Board\n\napplied the standards of 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(4) to either or both\n\nof   the   IJ's    conclusions   on   (1)    the   \"changed    circumstances\"\n\nexception to the time bar and (2) the issues of past and future\n\npersecution       that   constitute    the   merits    of     Haoud's   asylum\n\napplication.       The AWO in this case gives us no guidance as to\n\nwhether the Board affirmed the IJ's decision on a non-reviewable\n\nbasis, i.e. untimeliness, or a reviewable basis, i.e. the merits of\n\nHaoud's asylum claim.\n\n            Moreover, there is no way we can determine from the AWO\n\nwhether the Board reviewed the case and found a legitimate way of\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fdistinguishing the Touarsi case in denying Haoud's asylum claim.\n\nWe have stated that \"[w]hen the [Board] does not render its own\n\nopinion, . . ., and either defers [to] or adopts the opinion of the\n\nIJ, a Court of Appeals must then review the decision of the IJ.\"\n\nAlbathani v. INS, 318 F.3d 365, 373 (1st Cir. 2003), quoting Gao v.\n\nAshcroft, 299 F.3d 266, 271 (3d Cir. 2002); Herbert v. Ashcroft,\n\n325 F.3d 68, 71 (1st Cir. 2003).   This approach is inapposite here\n\nbecause the IJ never had the opportunity to consider Touarsi, which\n\nwas rendered following the IJ's decision. There, the Board granted\n\nanother Algerian national asylum on very similar facts and only\n\nfour months after the IJ's denial of Haoud's application.     Like\n\nHaoud, Touarsi had been arrested on December 30, 1999, by federal\n\nauthorities in a nationwide investigation of a suspected terrorist\n\nplot against targets in the United States by the GIA.   News of the\n\ninvestigation, including Touarsi's name, had been widely reported\n\nin the local and national press.   In re Amine Touarsi, A78 161 736\n\nat 1-2.   The Board held that Touarsi \"had a well-founded fear of\n\npersecution in Algeria on account of the political opinion that\n\nwould be imputed to him by that country's government, in that he\n\nwould be viewed and treated as an individual who sympathized with\n\nor supported the GIA or another Islamist terrorist group.\"   Id. at\n\n4.\n\n          Notwithstanding the fact that Haoud brought Touarsi to\n\nits attention, the Board failed to render a decision consistent\n\n\n\n                               -11-\n\fwith or fully explained as reasonably departing from its own\n\nprecedent in Touarsi.    As the regulation clearly sets out, \"Except\n\nas they may be modified or overruled by the Board or the Attorney\n\nGeneral, decisions of the Board shall be binding on all officers\n\nand   employees   of   the   Service   or   Immigration   Judges   in   the\n\nadministration of the Act.\"        8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(g).       Among the\n\npoints raised by Haoud with regard to the precedential value of\n\nTouarsi, besides the obvious factual similarities, are (1) the\n\nBoard's conclusion in Touarsi that asylum could be granted based on\n\nincidents that occurred solely in the United States, a proposition\n\nrejected by the IJ in Haoud's case; and (2) factual findings made\n\nby the Board in Touarsi that mirror the rejected testimony of Dr.\n\nEntelis.\n\n           The Board's use of the AWO procedure in this case runs\n\ncounter to what we have warned against in the past:\n\n           [A]dministrative agencies must apply the same basic rules\n           to all similarly situated supplicants. An agency cannot\n           merely flit serendipitously from case to case, like a bee\n           buzzing from flower to flower, making up the rules as it\n           goes along.\n\nHenry v. INS, 74 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1996).        Especially where the\n\nIJ did not have the opportunity to address Touarsi, the Board has\n\nan obligation to do so and thereby \"give careful, individualized,\n\nrational explanations for its decisions,\" Mousa v. INS, 223 F.3d\n\n425, 430 (7th Cir. 2000) and \"announce its decision in terms\n\nsufficient to enable a court to determine it heard and thought and\n\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\fnot merely reacted.\"         See Scorteanu v.

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Haoud is a native and citizen of Algeria. He entered the United States on a six-month visa in 1995 and stayed unlawfully after the expiration of the visa. On December 30, 1999, the FBI and local police came to his home in East Boston, Massachusetts, and arrested him for carrying a fraudulent green card. Law enforcement also questioned him about terrorist activities. Although a criminal charge was never filed against Haoud, numerous newspaper articles and television broadcasts linked him to the general terrorist scare on the eve of the new millennium, specifically with regard to Algerians arrested in Boston who had been questioned about their connections with terrorist groups such as the Armed Islamic Group of Algeria (\"GIA\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of the fraudulent green card and the fact that he had overstayed his visa, Haoud was held at an INS detention center throughout January 2000. On March 24, 2000, he submitted an application and supporting affidavit for asylum, withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1231(b)(3), withholding or deferral of removal under Article 3 of the United Nations Convention Against Torture, and voluntary departure under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a. He claimed that because his arrest for possessing a false green card had generated local and nationwide publicity implying that he was associated with an Algerian terrorist group, he feared persecution if he was returned to Algeria. At his asylum hearing, in addition to his own testimony, documentation of his arrest and the subsequent media coverage, Haoud produced Dr. John Entelis, an expert in Algerian politics from Fordham University, who testified that because of the paranoid climate pervading Algerian society and its government, Haoud would be in danger in Algeria as the government, knowing of the claims made against him in the United States, would consider him a terrorist or enemy of the state.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") denied all four of Haoud's applications. He decided that Haoud's asylum application was untimely filed and that he failed to establish changed circumstances to excuse that untimeliness. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1158(a)(2)(B) &amp; (D). Alternatively, the IJ found that Haoud's application failed to demonstrate either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution based on a reasonable possibility that he would suffer harm in Algeria. The IJ explained that Haoud could not use the media reports to \"manufacture an asylum claim\" and that Dr. Entelis's testimony was too speculative to support the claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after the IJ made these determinations, the Board decided a case, <i>In re Amine Touarsi,</i> Ala-rul-ilr (BIA 12/28/2000), involving another Algerian man who was arrested in Boston the same night as Haoud on the same suspicion of terrorism. Although the IJ denied Touarsi's asylum application, the Board on appeal reversed upon concluding that Touarsi had \"a well-founded fear of persecution in Algeria based on imputed political opinion.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Haoud timely appealed the IJ's decision to the Board. In his appeal, Haoud raised <i>Touarsi.</i> Notwithstanding that apparent precedent, the Board affirmed the IJ's decision without opinion under 9 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.1(e)(4).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the parties raise three primary issues: (1) whether we have jurisdiction to review the Board's decision; (2) whether the IJ's decision was in error; and (3) whether the Board's affirmance without opinion (AWO) violated the Board's own regulatory procedure. Because we decide this appeal on issue (3), we discuss issues (1) and (2) only as they bear on (3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For a determination by the Board of Immigration Appeals of statutory eligibility for relief from deportation, we review questions of law <i>de novo. See Civil v. INS,</i> 140 F.3d 52, 54 (1st Cir.1998). While deference is given to an agency's interpretation of the underlying statute, such interpretation must be \"in accordance with administrative law principles.\" <i>Debab v. INS,</i> 163 F.3d 21, 24 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Jurisdiction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government contends that we lack jurisdiction to review the IJ's denial of Haoud's asylum application because Haoud failed to file his application within one year of his arrival in the United States.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The government also argues that under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1158(a)(3), we are foreclosed from reviewing a determination that an alien failed to timely file an asylum application.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Haoud concedes that his asylum application was untimely, but argues that he presented \"extraordinary circumstances\" that excuse the delay, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1158(a)(2)(D).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our sister circuits agree that 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1158(a)(3) bars judicial review of the Board's decision as to the timeliness of an asylum application.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See Tarrawally v. Ashcroft,</i> 338 F.3d 180, 185 (3d Cir.2003); <i>Tsevegmid v. Ashcroft,</i> 318 F.3d 1226, 1230 (10th Cir.2003); <i>Fahim v. U.S. Attorney General,</i> 278 F.3d 1216, 1217 (11th Cir. 2002); <i>Hakeem v. INS,</i> 273 F.3d 812, 815 (9th Cir.2001). The Tenth Circuit in <i>Tsevegmid</i> explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court generally has jurisdiction to review the denial of any asylum request. See 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).... However, our jurisdiction to review a [Board] determination on the timeliness of an application for asylum is limited by statute. Section 1158(a)(3) expressly provides that the courts do not have \"jurisdiction to review any determination\" on whether the alien filed his application within a year of entry or whether \"changed circumstances\" exist \"which materially affect the applicant's eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">318 F.3d at 1229.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though we concur that 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1158(a)(3) could bar our review of the IJ's determination of the timeliness of Haoud's asylum application, resolution of this issue does not dispose of this case. As discussed <i>infra,</i> we must determine on what grounds, whether it be untimeliness or the merits of Haoud's asylum claim, the Board affirmed the IJ's decision. If the Board affirmed the IJ's decision on the merits of Haoud's persecution claims, but rejected the IJ's conclusion as to the untimeliness and \"changed circumstances\" issue, then we have jurisdiction over this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The IJ's Decision</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Haoud challenges the IJ's decision on the merits, arguing that the IJ made erroneous conclusions of law that were neither harmless nor immaterial, and hence led to an incorrect result in denying him asylum. Here the Board's decision effectively prevents a reviewing court from knowing whether the affirmance of the IJ's decision is reviewable or non-reviewable. The AWO cannot be used to deny our legitimate review power if we are left without a proper basis to determine our own jurisdiction or to evaluate the Board's own critical analysis, <i>see infra.</i> Accordingly, we refrain at this time from discussing the merits of the IJ's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. The Board's Affirmance Without Opinion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board \"has the duty to follow its own federal regulations.\" <i>Nelson v. INS,</i> 232 F.3d 258, 262 (1st Cir.2000); <i>see also Saakian v. INS,</i> 252 F.3d 21, 25-27 (1st Cir.2001). Failure to do so can result in the reversal of an agency order and a new hearing. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Haoud argues that the Board failed to follow its own regulatory procedure when it issued the affirmance without opinion (AWO) in this case. The Attorney General adopted the AWO procedure at issue in 1999. Rather than the usual three-member review, an AWO allows for review of a case by a single member, who then affirms the IJ's decision with the statement, \"The Board affirms, without opinion, the result of the decision below.\" 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.1(a)(7)(iii). Unlike decisions rendered after review by a three-member panel, a single Board member acting under 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.1(e)(4) is prohibited from explaining his decision on the merits in an AWO. Moreover, the regulation defines an AWO as a Board approval of only the \"result reached in the decision below.\" 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.1(e)(4). The AWO does not \"necessarily imply approval of all the reasoning\" of the IJ's decision, although it does signify the Board's conclusion that any errors were harmless or immaterial. <i>Id.</i> The Board member can issue an AWO only if he determines:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">that the result reached in the decision under review was correct; that any errors in the decision under review were harmless or nonmaterial; and that (A) The issues on appeal are squarely controlled by existing Board or federal court precedent and do not involve the application of precedent to a novel fact situation; or (B) The factual and legal issues raised on appeal are not so substantial that the case warrants the issuance of a written opinion in the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Id.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government strenuously argues that the Board's decision to streamline a particular case is committed to agency discretion and is not subject to judicial review. <i>See</i> 5 U.S.C. &#167; 701(a)(2); <i>Heckler v. Chaney,</i> 470 U.S. 821, 830, 105 S.Ct. 1649, 84 L.Ed.2d 714 (1985). Where a law \"is drawn so that a court would have no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency's exercise of discretion,\" Congress is assumed to have \"`committed' the decision making to the agency's judgment absolutely.\" <i>Heckler,</i> 470 U.S. at 830-32, 105 S.Ct. 1649.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Heckler</i> involved a decision by the federal Food and Drug Administration to refrain from instituting enforcement proceedings with respect to drugs used for lethal injections to carry out the death penalty. The Supreme Court found the FDA's decision unreviewable because it dealt with \"complicated balancing of factors\" that were \"peculiarly within [the agency's] expertise.\" <i>Id.</i> at 831. The Court found no applicable legal standard or \"law\" in the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act against which a court could legitimately review the FDA's decision not to commence enforcement proceedings. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the Board's own regulation provides more than enough \"law\" by which a court could review the Board's decision to streamline. As 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.1(e)(4) sets out <i>supra,</i> the Board cannot affirm an IJ's decision without opinion if the decision is incorrect, errors in the decision are not harmless or immaterial, the issues on appeal are not squarely controlled by Board or federal court precedent and involve the application of precedent to a novel fact situation, or the issues raised on appeal are so substantial that a full written opinion is necessary. Especially when the Board's review of an IJ's decision often hinges on Circuit court precedent, we are well-equipped, both statutorily and practically, to review a decision to streamline. <i>See Goncalves v. Reno,</i> 144 F.3d 110, 127 (1st Cir.1998), <i>cert. denied,</i> 526 U.S. 1004, 119 S.Ct. 1140, 143 L.Ed.2d 208 (1999) (upholding judiciary's role in determining whether an agency's interpretation of a statute is permissible).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government also postulates that the criteria of 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.1(e)(4) were met here and that there was no harmful error requiring review by a three-member panel of the Board. Without an explanation of the reasons for the decision, we cannot determine whether the Board &#8212; applying the proper standards under 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.1(e)(4) &#8212; adequately and correctly evaluated each of the criteria. Here, we do not know which of the alternatives outlined in the regulation was applied to affirm the IJ's decision, which itself was based on multiple grounds. Put another way, presently, we have no way of knowing whether and how the Board applied the standards of 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.1(e)(4) to either or both of the IJ's conclusions on (1) the \"changed circumstances\" exception to the time bar and (2) the issues of past and future persecution that constitute the merits of Haoud's asylum application. The AWO in this case gives us no guidance as to whether the Board affirmed the IJ's decision on a non-reviewable basis, i.e. untimeliness, or a reviewable basis, i.e. the merits of Haoud's asylum claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, there is no way we can determine from the AWO whether the Board reviewed the case and found a legitimate way of distinguishing the <i>Touarsi</i> case in denying Haoud's asylum claim. We have stated that \"[w]hen the [Board] does not render its own opinion, ..., and either defers [to] or adopts the opinion of the IJ, a Court of Appeals must then review the decision of the IJ.\" <i>Albathani v. INS,</i> 318 F.3d 365, 373 (1st Cir.2003), <i>quoting Gao v. Ashcroft,</i> 299 F.3d 266, 271 (3d Cir. 2002); <i>Herbert v. Ashcroft,</i> 325 F.3d 68, 71 (1st Cir.2003). This approach is inapposite here because the IJ never had the opportunity to consider <i>Touarsi,</i> which was rendered following the IJ's decision. There, the Board granted another Algerian national asylum on very similar facts and only four months after the IJ's denial of Haoud's application. Like Haoud, Touarsi had been arrested on December 30, 1999, by federal authorities in a nationwide investigation of a suspected terrorist plot against targets in the United States by the GIA. News of the investigation, including Touarsi's name, had been widely reported in the local and national press. <i>In re Amine Touarsi,</i> Ati-qpl-ggs at 1-2. The Board held that Touarsi \"had a well-founded fear of persecution in Algeria on account of the political opinion that would be imputed to him by that country's government, in that he would be viewed and treated as an individual who sympathized with or supported the GIA or another Islamist terrorist group.\" <i>Id.</i> at 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding the fact that Haoud brought <i>Touarsi</i> to its attention, the Board failed to render a decision consistent with or fully explained as reasonably departing from its own precedent in <i>Touarsi.</i> As the regulation clearly sets out, \"Except as they may be modified or overruled by the Board or the Attorney General, decisions of the Board shall be binding on all officers and employees of the Service or Immigration Judges in the administration of the Act.\" 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.1(g). Among the points raised by Haoud with regard to the precedential value of <i>Touarsi,</i> besides the obvious factual similarities, are (1) the Board's conclusion in <i>Touarsi</i> that asylum could be granted based on incidents that occurred solely in the United States, a proposition rejected by the IJ in Haoud's case; and (2) factual findings made by the Board in <i>Touarsi</i> that mirror the rejected testimony of Dr. Entelis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board's use of the AWO procedure in this case runs counter to what we have warned against in the past:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[A]dministrative agencies must apply the same basic rules to all similarly situated supplicants. An agency cannot merely flit serendipitously from case to case, like a bee buzzing from flower to flower, making up the rules as it goes along.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Henry v. INS,</i> 74 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.1996). Especially where the IJ did not have the opportunity to address <i>Touarsi,</i> the Board has an obligation to do so and thereby \"give careful, individualized, rational explanations for its decisions,\" <i>Mousa v. INS,</i> 223 F.3d 425, 430 (7th Cir.2000) and \"announce its decision in terms sufficient to enable a court to determine it heard and thought and not merely reacted.\" <i>See Scorteanu v. INS,</i> 339 F.3d 407, 412 (6th Cir.2003) (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the AWO, we cannot determine whether the Board reviewed Haoud's case and found a legitimate means of distinguishing it from <i>Touarsi.</i> As we held in <i>Albathani v. INS,</i> \"If the [Board] identifies an alternative satisfactory ground for upholding the denial of asylum in a case with an otherwise unsatisfactory decision by the IJ, it must state it or risk remand.\" 318 F.3d at 378. The Board's use of the AWO must not interfere with Haoud's \"right to a reasoned administrative decision.\" <i>See</i> Executive Office of Immigration Review; Board of Immigration Appeals: Streamlining, 64 FR 56135, 56137 (1999).

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Haoud is a native and citizen of Algeria. He entered the United States on a six-month visa in 1995 and stayed unlawfully after the expiration of the visa. On December 30, 1999, the FBI and local police came to his home in East Boston, Massachusetts, and arrested him for carrying a fraudulent green card. Law enforcement also questioned him about terrorist activities. Although a criminal charge was never filed against Haoud, numerous newspaper articles and television broadcasts linked him to the general terrorist scare on the eve of the new millennium, specifically with regard to Algerians arrested in Boston who had been questioned about their connections with terrorist groups such as the Armed Islamic Group of Algeria (\"GIA\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of the fraudulent green card and the fact that he had overstayed his visa, Haoud was held at an INS detention center throughout January 2000. On March 24, 2000, he submitted an application and supporting affidavit for asylum, withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1231(b)(3), withholding or deferral of removal under Article 3 of the United Nations Convention Against Torture, and voluntary departure under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a. He claimed that because his arrest for possessing a false green card had generated local and nationwide publicity implying that he was associated with an Algerian terrorist group, he feared persecution if he was returned to Algeria. At his asylum hearing, in addition to his own testimony, documentation of his arrest and the subsequent media coverage, Haoud produced Dr. John Entelis, an expert in Algerian politics from Fordham University, who testified that because of the paranoid climate pervading Algerian society and its government, Haoud would be in danger in Algeria as the government, knowing of the claims made against him in the United States, would consider him a terrorist or enemy of the state.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") denied all four of Haoud's applications. He decided that Haoud's asylum application was untimely filed and that he failed to establish changed circumstances to excuse that untimeliness. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1158(a)(2)(B) &amp; (D). Alternatively, the IJ found that Haoud's application failed to demonstrate either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution based on a reasonable possibility that he would suffer harm in Algeria. The IJ explained that Haoud could not use the media reports to \"manufacture an asylum claim\" and that Dr. Entelis's testimony was too speculative to support the claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after the IJ made these determinations, the Board decided a case, <i>In re Amine Touarsi,</i> Ala-rul-ilr (BIA 12/28/2000), involving another Algerian man who was arrested in Boston the same night as Haoud on the same suspicion of terrorism. Although the IJ denied Touarsi's asylum application, the Board on appeal reversed upon concluding that Touarsi had \"a well-founded fear of persecution in Algeria based on imputed political opinion.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Haoud timely appealed the IJ's decision to the Board. In his appeal, Haoud raised <i>Touarsi.</i> Notwithstanding that apparent precedent, the Board affirmed the IJ's decision without opinion under 9 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.1(e)(4).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the parties raise three primary issues: (1) whether we have jurisdiction to review the Board's decision; (2) whether the IJ's decision was in error; and (3) whether the Board's affirmance without opinion (AWO) violated the Board's own regulatory procedure. Because we decide this appeal on issue (3), we discuss issues (1) and (2) only as they bear on (3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For a determination by the Board of Immigration Appeals of statutory eligibility for relief from deportation, we review questions of law <i>de novo.

The Tenth Circuit in <i>Tsevegmid</i> explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court generally has jurisdiction to review the denial of any asylum request. See 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).... However, our jurisdiction to review a [Board] determination on the timeliness of an application for asylum is limited by statute. Section 1158(a)(3) expressly provides that the courts do not have \"jurisdiction to review any determination\" on whether the alien filed his application within a year of entry or whether \"changed circumstances\" exist \"which materially affect the applicant's eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">318 F.3d at 1229.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though we concur that 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1158(a)(3) could bar our review of the IJ's determination of the timeliness of Haoud's asylum application, resolution of this issue does not dispose of this case. As discussed <i>infra,</i> we must determine on what grounds, whether it be untimeliness or the merits of Haoud's asylum claim, the Board affirmed the IJ's decision. If the Board affirmed the IJ's decision on the merits of Haoud's persecution claims, but rejected the IJ's conclusion as to the untimeliness and \"changed circumstances\" issue, then we have jurisdiction over this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The IJ's Decision</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Haoud challenges the IJ's decision on the merits, arguing that the IJ made erroneous conclusions of law that were neither harmless nor immaterial, and hence led to an incorrect result in denying him asylum. Here the Board's decision effectively prevents a reviewing court from knowing whether the affirmance of the IJ's decision is reviewable or non-reviewable. The AWO cannot be used to deny our legitimate review power if we are left without a proper basis to determine our own jurisdiction or to evaluate the Board's own critical analysis, <i>see infra.</i> Accordingly, we refrain at this time from discussing the merits of the IJ's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. The Board's Affirmance Without Opinion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board \"has the duty to follow its own federal regulations.\" <i>Nelson v.

Failure to do so can result in the reversal of an agency order and a new hearing. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Haoud argues that the Board failed to follow its own regulatory procedure when it issued the affirmance without opinion (AWO) in this case. The Attorney General adopted the AWO procedure at issue in 1999. Rather than the usual three-member review, an AWO allows for review of a case by a single member, who then affirms the IJ's decision with the statement, \"The Board affirms, without opinion, the result of the decision below.\" 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.1(a)(7)(iii). Unlike decisions rendered after review by a three-member panel, a single Board member acting under 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.1(e)(4) is prohibited from explaining his decision on the merits in an AWO. Moreover, the regulation defines an AWO as a Board approval of only the \"result reached in the decision below.\" 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.1(e)(4). The AWO does not \"necessarily imply approval of all the reasoning\" of the IJ's decision, although it does signify the Board's conclusion that any errors were harmless or immaterial. <i>Id.</i> The Board member can issue an AWO only if he determines:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">that the result reached in the decision under review was correct; that any errors in the decision under review were harmless or nonmaterial; and that (A) The issues on appeal are squarely controlled by existing Board or federal court precedent and do not involve the application of precedent to a novel fact situation; or (B) The factual and legal issues raised on appeal are not so substantial that the case warrants the issuance of a written opinion in the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Id.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government strenuously argues that the Board's decision to streamline a particular case is committed to agency discretion and is not subject to judicial review. <i>See</i> 5 U.S.C. &#167; 701(a)(2); <i>Heckler v.

The Court found no applicable legal standard or \"law\" in the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act against which a court could legitimately review the FDA's decision not to commence enforcement proceedings. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the Board's own regulation provides more than enough \"law\" by which a court could review the Board's decision to streamline. As 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.1(e)(4) sets out <i>supra,</i> the Board cannot affirm an IJ's decision without opinion if the decision is incorrect, errors in the decision are not harmless or immaterial, the issues on appeal are not squarely controlled by Board or federal court precedent and involve the application of precedent to a novel fact situation, or the issues raised on appeal are so substantial that a full written opinion is necessary. Especially when the Board's review of an IJ's decision often hinges on Circuit court precedent, we are well-equipped, both statutorily and practically, to review a decision to streamline. <i>See Goncalves v.

Here, we do not know which of the alternatives outlined in the regulation was applied to affirm the IJ's decision, which itself was based on multiple grounds. Put another way, presently, we have no way of knowing whether and how the Board applied the standards of 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.1(e)(4) to either or both of the IJ's conclusions on (1) the \"changed circumstances\" exception to the time bar and (2) the issues of past and future persecution that constitute the merits of Haoud's asylum application. The AWO in this case gives us no guidance as to whether the Board affirmed the IJ's decision on a non-reviewable basis, i.e. untimeliness, or a reviewable basis, i.e. the merits of Haoud's asylum claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, there is no way we can determine from the AWO whether the Board reviewed the case and found a legitimate way of distinguishing the <i>Touarsi</i> case in denying Haoud's asylum claim.

This approach is inapposite here because the IJ never had the opportunity to consider <i>Touarsi,</i> which was rendered following the IJ's decision. There, the Board granted another Algerian national asylum on very similar facts and only four months after the IJ's denial of Haoud's application. Like Haoud, Touarsi had been arrested on December 30, 1999, by federal authorities in a nationwide investigation of a suspected terrorist plot against targets in the United States by the GIA. News of the investigation, including Touarsi's name, had been widely reported in the local and national press. <i>In re Amine Touarsi,</i> Ati-qpl-ggs at 1-2. The Board held that Touarsi \"had a well-founded fear of persecution in Algeria on account of the political opinion that would be imputed to him by that country's government, in that he would be viewed and treated as an individual who sympathized with or supported the GIA or another Islamist terrorist group.\" <i>Id.</i> at 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding the fact that Haoud brought <i>Touarsi</i> to its attention, the Board failed to render a decision consistent with or fully explained as reasonably departing from its own precedent in <i>Touarsi.</i> As the regulation clearly sets out, \"Except as they may be modified or overruled by the Board or the Attorney General, decisions of the Board shall be binding on all officers and employees of the Service or Immigration Judges in the administration of the Act.\" 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.1(g). Among the points raised by Haoud with regard to the precedential value of <i>Touarsi,</i> besides the obvious factual similarities, are (1) the Board's conclusion in <i>Touarsi</i> that asylum could be granted based on incidents that occurred solely in the United States, a proposition rejected by the IJ in Haoud's case; and (2) factual findings made by the Board in <i>Touarsi</i> that mirror the rejected testimony of Dr. Entelis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board's use of the AWO procedure in this case runs counter to what we have warned against in the past:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[A]dministrative agencies must apply the same basic rules to all similarly situated supplicants.

As <i>Touarsi</i> bears strongly on Haoud's asylum application, an AWO affirming an IJ's decision that never considered Touarsi fails to meet this mandate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore <i>remand</i> to the Board for further agency proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1158(a)(2)(B) provides</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Subject to subparagraph (D), paragraph (1) shall not apply to an alien unless the alien demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed within 1 year after the date of the alien's arrival in the United States.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1158(a)(3) provides</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">No Court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney General under paragraph (2).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1158(a)(2)(D) provides</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">An application for asylum of an alien may be considered, notwithstanding subparagraphs (B) and (C), if the alien demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Attorney General either the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant's eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application within the period specified in subparagraph (B).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> We are not similarly barred from reviewing the IJ's denial of Haoud's applications for withholding of removal, Convention Against Torture protection, and voluntary departure.
