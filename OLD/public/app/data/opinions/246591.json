This appeal if from an order of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, entered November 7, 1958, dismissing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus and denying the writ.

See Roemer v. Simon, 1875, 91 U.S. 149, 23 L.Ed. 267.  Of course, appellant should not be cut short in his appeal time.  Therefore we assume that the district judge will vacate his prior order of November 7, and after filing a new set of findings will enter an appropriate new order, from which an appeal can be taken in the usual course.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An order will be entered dismissing the present appeal without prejudice, and forthwith remanding the case to the District Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
