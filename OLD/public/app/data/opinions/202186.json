After reviewing the testimony and\n\ndocuments in the record, we affirm.\n\n                                             I.\n\n               On March 31, 2002, Fatmir Hoxha (\"Hoxha\"), his wife,\n\nErmira Hoxha, and their two children, Vincenzo and Anxhelo Hoxha,\n\nentered the United States without proper documentation.                           Several\n\nmonths later, on June 19, 2002, Hoxha applied for asylum and\n\nwithholding of removal, and for relief under the Convention Against\n\nTorture, asserting that he and his family were persecuted on\n\naccount of his membership in the Democratic Party of Albania.1                           In\n\nsupport of his application, Hoxha submitted two declarations:                           one\n\ndated June 2002, and the other July 2002.                   In August 2002, the INS\n\nserved     Hoxha     with     a    Notice     to   Appear,     charging         him   with\n\nremoveability        under     §   237(a)(1)(A)       of     the     Immigration       and\n\nNationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A).                  On September 30, 2003,\n\nafter hearing testimony on the merits of Hoxha's application, the\n\nIJ    denied    it   and     entered    an    order    of    removal       to    Albania.\n\nSpecifically, the IJ made a negative credibility determination\n\n\n\n1\n  Hoxha's wife and children are derivatives listed on his asylum\napplication.\n\n                                            -2-\n\fbased    on   discrepancies   between     Hoxha’s   two   declarations,       and\n\nbetween those declarations and his in-court testimony.                 The BIA\n\nissued a summary affirmance without opinion on March 28, 2003.2\n\nHoxha    filed    this   petition,   claiming   that   the    IJ's   decision,\n\naffirmed by the BIA, is not supported by substantial evidence, and\n\nthat the BIA violated its own regulatory procedure by streamlining\n\nHoxha's case and affirming the IJ's decision without opinion.\n\n                                      II.\n\n              We summarize the testimonial and documentary evidence\n\nthat Hoxha presented to the IJ and then discuss the IJ's evaluation\n\nof that evidence.\n\nA.            Summary of Evidence\n\n              Hoxha was born in Tirana, the capital of Albania, where\n\nhe lived for approximately thirty-five years before coming to the\n\nUnited States.       Hoxha was self-employed as the owner of a \"fast\n\nfood business.\"      In 1995, he joined the ruling Democratic Party of\n\nAlbania, \"participat[ing] in every rally and meeting,\" contributing\n\nmoney,    and    \"help[ing]   recruit[]     young   people,   new    people   to\n\nincrease the membership.\"       The Democratic Party remained in power\n\nfrom March 1992 until June 1997, when the Socialist Party was\n\nelected.      Hoxha's problems with the government then began.\n\n\n\n\n2\n  \"Where, as here, the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the\nIJ, we review the decision of the IJ.\" Mihaylov v. Ashcroft, 379\nF.3d 15, 18 n.3 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n                                      -3-\n\f            On June 30, 1997, police beat Hoxha over the head with\n\nclubs while he attended a meeting in the public square protesting\n\nthe Socialist Party's \"manipulation of the election that took place\n\nin June.\"        Police arrested Hoxha, forced him into a car, and\n\ncontinued to beat him on the way to \"prison number 313.\"                         Once\n\nthere, police beat Hoxha more severely, using their fists and\n\nclubs, and kicking him all over his body.                        Hoxha remained in\n\ncustody overnight.        The following day, police asked Hoxha to sign\n\na document stating that he had participated in an illegal meeting,\n\nwhich he refused to do.          Before releasing Hoxha, police told him\n\nnot to attend any more meetings.\n\n            The following year, on March 31, 1998, a suspicious fire\n\noccurred at the home of Hoxha's father during a visit from Hoxha,\n\nhis son Anxhelo, and several of Anxehlo's friends.                     Hoxha \"heard\n\nthe children screaming\" and \"saw flames coming out of the room.\"\n\nHis son \"had flames on his arm and another child also and my son's\n\nhands were taken afire.\"        Hoxha took his son to the hospital, where\n\nhis son remained for seventeen days.\n\n            On    May    24,   1998,    when      Hoxha    was   returning   from   a\n\nDemocratic Party rally, people in civilian clothing hit him \"very\n\nhard   without     any    warning      or    saying       anything,\"   leaving   him\n\nunconscious on the ground where he remained for several hours.\n\nHoxha, accompanied by his wife, sought medical treatment at the\n\nhospital for his injuries.          One year later, on September 12, 1999,\n\n\n                                            -4-\n\fpolice    again   arrested   Hoxha   at    an   \"illegal   meeting\"   of   the\n\nDemocratic Party. At the police station, police subjected Hoxha to\n\n\"very hard heavy physical violence,\" including beatings \"with\n\nrubber sticks and the butt of a gun.\"           Hoxha explains that police\n\n\"cut my eyebrow, all the parts of my body, they were hitting me.\n\nThey tied me to the chair.     They were hitting me on the legs and on\n\nthe head . . . .\"    The police then told Hoxha that they had started\n\nthe fire that injured his son, stating that \"for 45 years we are in\n\npower, we are going to kill you.           Like we burned your house.       We\n\nare going to try to burn your house.             We are going to burn you\n\nout.\"\n\n            On March 22, 2000, at a Democratic Party meeting in the\n\npublic square celebrating \"the anniversary of the victory of\n\ndemocracy,\" police arrested Hoxha and beat him in custody.             Hoxha\n\nexplains that police were \"pulling [his] hair\" and hitting him on\n\nthe back, and that he \"was unconscious several time[s] from the\n\npolice brutality.\"       Police held him in custody overnight and\n\nreleased him the following day, warning him that if they saw him at\n\nany more meetings, he \"was the first one [they were] going to\n\ngrab.\"\n\n            The following month, three men in civilian clothing\n\napproached him on the street and began beating him.              They \"told\n\n[him] to stop [his] political activities\" and then left him on the\n\nground.    On June 5, 2000, police approached Hoxha at a Democratic\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fParty meeting and began punching him.       According to Hoxha, \"[t]wo\n\nof them were holding me.        One of them was punching me in the\n\nstomach with police clubs in the back.\"        Hoxha received medical\n\ntreatment for \"shock[] and [] depress[ion].\"\n\n            In October of that year, Hoxha was chosen to represent\n\nthe Democratic Party as a member of the commission charged with\n\nensuring the fairness of the local mayoral elections.       Hoxha began\n\nreceiving   anonymous   and   threatening   phone   calls   and   letters\n\nthroughout the month, telling him that he \"should pull out . . .\n\nshould resign as a member of the democratic party[], [and] threats\n\nagainst [his] children.\"      Immediately following the elections, on\n\nhis way out of the election office, Hoxha was attacked by several\n\npeople \"dressed in civilian clothing,\" who thr[e]w [him] to the\n\nground, hitting [him] hard, [with] heavy objects, [and] punching\n\n[him].\"   Hoxha sought medical treatment at the hospital for a cut\n\non the back of his head and received several stitches.\n\n            On October 26, 2000, police approached Hoxha and his wife\n\nin the public square as they protested the manipulation of the\n\nmayoral elections. One police officer \"threw [Hoxha] on the ground\n\n. . . punched [him], kicked [him] on the lip [and] punched him,\"\n\nwhile other officers hit his wife and pulled her hair.       Police then\n\nhandcuffed Hoxha and brought him and his wife to the police\n\nstation, where they \"beat[] [him] with police clubs and kicking.\"\n\nHoxha was \"bleeding very much,\" and police brought him to the\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fhospital, where he received stitches for the cut on his lip.               He\n\nwas   then   brought   back   to   the     police   station,   where   police\n\nquestioned him about his participation in the illegal meeting and\n\ntold him \"not to go to meetings anymore because they are illegal.\"\n\nHoxha responded by telling the police that he would \"take them to\n\ncourt\" for beating him and his wife.         The police released Hoxha and\n\nhis wife after three days.         Hoxha's wife \"had a swollen eye.        In\n\nthe face, they slapped her and they were pulling her hair in the\n\ncell.\"   After his release, Hoxha filed a complaint with the local\n\ndistrict attorney's office, but the complaint was never prosecuted.\n\n             On January 24, 2001, Hoxha's house was hit with \"heavy\n\nmachine guns,\" which injured his son, Anxhelo, whose \"left leg was\n\nbleeding.\"    Hoxha and his wife took their son to the hospital, but\n\nwere told that the hospital lacked \"conditions to operate on him,\"\n\nand that they should instead take their son to Greece to receive\n\ntreatment. Hoxha arranged for his brother, who lived in Greece, to\n\ntake Anxhelo to a hospital there.            Anxhelo returned from Greece\n\nover a week later, on approximately February 3 or 4.                   Shortly\n\nthereafter, Hoxha decided to flee Albania.\n\n             On February 8, 2001, Hoxha sold his fast food business;\n\nthe following month, he and his family left Tirana for Vlora,\n\nAlbania.     They remained in Vlora for over a year.            During that\n\ntime, in December 2001, Hoxha briefly returned to Tirana to discuss\n\nobtaining passports so that he and his family could leave Albania.\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fWhile in Tirana, Hoxha attended a Democratic Party activity.\n\nDuring a lunch break, approximately four civilians attacked Hoxha\n\nas he sat with several friends at a coffee shop.                   According to\n\nHoxha, \"I fell down and I was bleeding and they said – you are the\n\none   criticizing    everywhere   that    you   are   going?   –    You   forgot\n\nsomething that we are back in power son of the beach [sic].\"                They\n\nthen kicked him and beat him.\n\n           On March 30, 2002, Hoxha and his family traveled by plane\n\nto Milan, Italy, and then to Montreal, Canada, where they arrived\n\non March 31, 2002.    That same day, Hoxha and his family crossed the\n\nCanadian border into the United States using passports provided by\n\na smuggler, took a taxi to Albany, New York, and arrived in New\n\nYork City by bus.\n\n           Hoxha also submitted numerous documentary sources in\n\nsupport   of   his     application,       including:       two       membership\n\nverifications for the Democratic Party; an alleged certificate from\n\nthe district attorney of Tirana stating that Hoxha and his wife\n\nwere \"mistreated by the police\" following a demonstration on\n\nOctober 26, 2000; a membership card from the Association of Ex-\n\nPolitically Persecuted of Albania stating that he \"belonged to a\n\npersecuted family\"; a medical report from the University Hospital\n\nCenter of Tirana regarding the treatment of Anxhelo Hoxha for\n\nburns; an alleged newspaper article dated May 25, 2001, regarding\n\nthe persecution of Hoxha and his family; and the State Department's\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\f2002 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for Albania, which\n\nreported that \"police beat and otherwise abused suspects, detainees\n\nand prisoners,\" and that police \"arbitrarily arrested and detained\n\npersons.\"\n\nB.          IJ's Evaluation of Evidence\n\n            The IJ denied Hoxha's request for asylum, withholding of\n\nremoval, and withholding under the Convention Against Torture,\n\nbased on an adverse credibility determination.3          In reaching this\n\ndetermination, the IJ recognized that \"a credibility assessment is\n\nnot reducible to a finite formula, and that all factors must be\n\nconsidered    both   individually   and   cumulatively.\"     While   \"mere\n\ntrivial errors or errors incidental to a claim are insufficient for\n\nan adverse credibility finding,\" the IJ reasoned, \"discrepancies\n\nand omissions [that] cumulatively go to the heart of the claim or\n\notherwise    show    testimony   ultimately   dubious\"   support   such   a\n\nfinding.     Where these discrepancies and omissions exist, the IJ\n\nnoted, \"the three prong test of [In re A-S-, 21 I & N Dec. 1106,\n\n1109 (BIA 1998)], must also be met,\" that is,\n\n          (1) the discrepancies and omissions described by the\n     Immigration Judge must actually be present in the record;\n          (2) the discrepancies and omissions must provide\n     specific and cogent reasons to conclude that the alien\n     provided incredible testimony; and\n\n\n3\n  According to the IJ, \"[d]espite the adverse credibility finding,\nthe Court did find th[e] portion of [Hoxha's] testimony, relative\nto his manner and date of arrival in the United States, to be\nsufficiently credible to justify considering [his] application for\nasylum on the merits.\"\n\n                                    -9-\n\f          (3) a convincing explanation for the discrepancies\n     or omissions must not have been supplied by the alien.\n\n             Even where these credibility factors are present, the IJ\n\nnoted that \"there may be circumstances where an individual's\n\nability to recall dates and times would be in doubt, but should not\n\nundermine    the   individual's   credibility.\"          These   circumstances\n\ninclude where an individual has \"suffered traumatic occurrences\n\ndistant in time and in a manner that can impair his ability to\n\nprovide chronologically cogent and persuasive testimony,\" or where\n\nan individual who \"is not represented by counsel, either in the\n\npreparation of the application or in Court,\" is \"unartful\" in the\n\npresentation of his case.\n\n             The IJ determined that, in light of all of these factors,\n\n\"[t]he discrepancies and omissions in this case are significant,\n\nand cause this Court to have so [sic] serious doubts about the\n\nrespondent's credibility that the Court is without recourse, but to\n\nenter   an    adverse    credibility         finding.\"     In    making   this\n\ndetermination,     the   IJ   noted   numerous     inconsistencies    between\n\nHoxha's two declarations, and between those declarations and his\n\nin-court testimony.      Hoxha's first declaration does not reference\n\nthe March 31, 1998 fire that injured his son, and the second\n\ndeclaration states that the fire occurred on March 3, not March 31,\n\n1998.   Neither declaration mentions that during the September 12,\n\n1999 incident, police admitted to setting the fire.              While Hoxha's\n\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\ftestimony and second declaration both refer to his being beaten\n\nfollowing the mayoral elections in October 2000, Hoxha's first\n\ndeclaration states that the elections took place one year later in\n\nOctober 2001.        In addition, neither declaration mentions the\n\nOctober 26, 2000 incident in which police beat and detained Hoxha\n\nand his wife.\n\n            The IJ found \"very significant . . . the fact that the\n\nrespondent was unequivocal that he says that he sold his business\n\non February 8, 2001, while both declarations indicate that the\n\nrespondent's business was sold by him in August of 2000.\"         The IJ\n\nalso noted the \"drastically different\" reasons that Hoxha gave for\n\nselling his business:      Hoxha testified that he sold his business\n\nshortly after his son was injured by heavy artillery and was sent\n\nto   Greece    for   treatment,   while   \"in   both   declarations,   the\n\nrespondent stated that the business was sold after they were\n\nconstantly being threatened by the secret service.\"          The IJ also\n\nfound \"very significant\" the discrepancy surrounding the date on\n\nwhich Hoxha's son returned from Greece after receiving medical\n\ntreatment.     According to the IJ, \"[t]he respondent was clear that\n\nhis son returned from Greece in early February perhaps February 4,\n\n2001, while both declarations state that his son returned on March\n\n4, 2001.\"     Lastly, the IJ notes that unlike his second declaration\n\nand testimony, Hoxha's first declaration does not mention the\n\n\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fDecember    2001   incident        in    which      he    was    attacked     by   several\n\ncivilians upon returning to Tirana.\n\n              The IJ stated that he was also troubled by the fact that\n\nHoxha's attorney knew of only one of the two declarations submitted\n\nby Hoxha and thus knew nothing of the inconsistencies between the\n\ntwo. By failing to address these inconsistencies in a supplemental\n\nor amended application prior to the hearing before the IJ, Hoxha's\n\nattorney    \"effectively         ratified      one    or    both     declarations      that\n\nexisted in this record.\"           In addition, while Hoxha claimed that he\n\nwent over his application with his attorney, neither Hoxha nor his\n\nattorney      seemed     to    know     of   the     inconsistencies         between   the\n\ndeclarations and the testimony that Hoxha planned to give at the\n\nhearing before the IJ.            As a result, the IJ noted, Hoxha made no\n\nattempt at the hearing to address the inconsistencies between his\n\ntwo declarations and between the declarations and his testimony.\n\n              Based on this evidence, the IJ determined that he could\n\nnot   enter    a   favorable       credibility           finding.      \"[D]espite      the\n\nexistence of documentation in the record that on its face seems to\n\nverify much of what the respondent has claimed happened,\" the IJ\n\nstated     that    the        documents       proffered         by   Hoxha    were     \"not\n\nauthenticated and their mere existence is insufficient to overcome\n\nthe adverse credibility finding . . . .\"                   In addition, the IJ noted\n\nthat Hoxha did not attempt to rehabilitate his credibility by\n\nproviding corroborating evidence, such as documentation of his\n\n\n\n                                             -12-\n\fson's medical treatment in Greece or his own medical treatment in\n\nTirana.    \"If credible,\" the IJ noted,\n\n       there is certainly nothing inherently implausible about\n       the respondent's claim, given the now evolving conditions\n       in Albania.

Adverse Credibility Determination\n\n          The IJ determined that Hoxha was not credible based on\n\nnumerous inconsistencies between Hoxha's two declarations, and\n\nbetween those declarations and Hoxha's testimony at the hearing.\n\nRelying upon the BIA's three-prong test for evaluating credibility\n\nset forth in In re A-S-, the IJ found (1) discrepancies and\n\ninconsistencies in the record (2) which provided specific, cogent\n\nreasons for an adverse credibility determination, and (3) which\n\nwere not adequately explained by Hoxha.\n\n          1.      Discrepancies and Inconsistencies in Record\n\n          Hoxha   does   not   take   issue   with   the     IJ’s   findings\n\nregarding the first prong of this test; he concedes that there are\n\ninconsistencies between the June 2002 and July 2002 declarations,\n\nand between those declarations and his testimony at the hearing\n\nbefore the IJ.\n\n          2.      Specific, Cogent Reasons\n\n          Hoxha   argues   that,    for   a   variety   of    reasons,   the\n\ninconsistencies in this case do not provide cogent reasons for an\n\nadverse credibility determination.\n\n\n\n\nACT § 101(h)(2), these provisions are not applicable to this case.\n\n                                   -15-\n\f                  a.    Heart of the Asylum Claim\n\n           Hoxha first argues that the inconsistencies cited by the\n\nIJ do not undermine Hoxha's credibility because they are \"minor\"\n\nand \"do not go to the heart of the applicant's asylum claim.\"               We\n\nhave stated that \"an adverse credibility determination cannot rest\n\non trivia but must be based on discrepancies that involved the\n\nheart of the asylum claim.\"   Bojorques-Villanueva v. INS, 194 F.3d\n\n14, 16 (1st Cir. 1999) (internal citation and quotation marks\n\nomitted); see also Secaida-Rosales, 331 F.3d at 308 (stating that\n\n\"[i]nconsistencies of less than substantial importance for which a\n\nplausible explanation is offered cannot form the sole basis for an\n\nadverse   credibility   finding.    .     .    .   especially   []   when   the\n\ninconsistencies do not concern the basis for the claim of asylum or\n\nwithholding, but rather matters collateral or ancillary to the\n\nclaim\" (internal citations and quotation marks omitted)); Shah v.\n\nINS, 220 F.3d 1062, 1068 (9th Cir. 2000) (\"Minor inconsistencies in\n\nthe record such as discrepancies in dates which reveal nothing\n\nabout an asylum applicant's fear for his safety are not an adequate\n\nbasis for an adverse credibility finding.\" (internal quotation\n\nmarks and citation omitted)).\n\n           The heart of Hoxha's claim of asylum is that he and his\n\nfamily were persecuted on account of his political activity with\n\nthe Democratic Party of Albania.              The numerous inconsistencies\n\nbetween Hoxha's two declarations, and between the declarations and\n\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\fHoxha's        sworn      testimony,         closely     relate       to     this    alleged\n\npersecution.              These   inconsistencies         include:           discrepancies\n\nsurrounding the date on which police set fire to Hoxha's home and\n\nomissions concerning whether police admitted setting the fire;\n\ndiscrepancies surrounding the year in which Hoxha was beaten\n\nfollowing his participation in the mayoral elections; omissions\n\nconcerning whether Hoxha and his wife were beaten and detained by\n\npolice in October 2000; discrepancies surrounding the year in which\n\nHoxha     sold      his      business    and     his     reasons       for    selling      it;\n\ndiscrepancies surrounding the date on which Hoxha's son returned\n\nfrom the hospital after being injured by artillery fired at Hoxha's\n\nhome;    and     omissions        concerning         whether    Hoxha       was   beaten   by\n\ncivilians after briefly returning to Tirana in December 2001.\n\n               Far from trivial, the numerous inconsistencies cited by\n\nthe IJ involve the heart of Hoxha's asylum claim and thus support\n\nthe     IJ's     adverse       credibility       finding.          Compare        Bojorques-\n\nVillanueva,         194    F.3d   at    17    (holding     that       the    BIA's   adverse\n\ncredibility finding was supported by substantial evidence where\n\n\"the inconsistencies noted by the Board were more than several and\n\nmore than minor, such as an error in dates or typographical error\"\n\nand \"the multiple inconsistencies went to the central facts,\" i.e.,\n\n\"the where, the who, the when and the what\" of the triggering\n\nevent), and In re A-S-, 21 I & N Dec. at 1110 (holding that \"the\n\nomission       of      key    events     []     coupled        with     numerous      [date]\n\n\n\n                                              -17-\n\finconsistencies,\" was a \"specific and cogent reason supporting the\n\n[IJ]'s adverse credibility finding\"), with Vilorio-Lopez v. INS,\n\n852 F.2d 1137, 1142 (9th Cir. 1988) (\"Minor inconsistencies in the\n\nrecord such as discrepancies in dates which reveal nothing about an\n\nasylum applicant's fear for his safety are not an adequate basis\n\nfor an adverse credibility finding.\"), and Martinez-Sanchez v. INS,\n\n794 F.2d 1396, 1400 (9th Cir. 1986) (holding that two \"trivial\n\nerrors\" in an otherwise consistent record \"did not constitute a\n\nvalid ground upon which to base a finding that an asylum applicant\n\nis not credible\").\n\n                   b.     Legitimate Nexus\n\n           Hoxha further argues that \"even assuming that some of the\n\ndiscrepancies contained in the written statements involved matters\n\ncentral   to   [his]    asylum   claim,\"    these   discrepancies   bear   no\n\n\"legitimate nexus\" to the IJ's adverse credibility finding.                \"A\n\nreasonable factfinder upon review of the entire record,\" Hoxha\n\ncontends, \"would be compelled to conclude that the discrepancies in\n\nthe statements indicated not negative credibility, but sloppy and\n\nirresponsible lawyering.\"\n\n           In support of this argument, Hoxha notes that both\n\ndeclarations    were     \"written   in     broken   English   replete   with\n\ngrammatical and spelling errors, typos, and long passages of\n\nboilerplate legal language unrelated to [his] specific asylum\n\nclaim.\"   Many of the discrepancies in dates, Hoxha argues, \"seem\n\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\findicative        of    typographical     errors    rather      than    lack    of\n\ncredibility,\" such as where the June 2002 declaration erroneously\n\nstates that the fire at the home of Hoxha's father started on\n\n\"March 3, 1998\" instead of on March 31, 1998.             Hoxha also contends\n\nthat   he   was    wholly    unprepared    for    questioning    regarding     the\n\ninconsistencies between his first and second declarations, and\n\nbetween those declarations and his testimony, because his lawyer\n\ndid not review the declarations with him prior to the hearing\n\nbefore the IJ.         Hoxha supports this contention by noting that he\n\ndid not sign either declaration; both declarations are in English,\n\nwhich he could not read; and neither he nor his attorney were aware\n\nof the existence of a second declaration.\n\n            An IJ's reasons for rejecting an applicant's testimony on\n\ncredibility grounds must \"bear a legitimate nexus\" to the adverse\n\ncredibility finding.          Secaida, 331 F.3d at 307.         We find such a\n\nnexus here.        While the contents of Hoxha's declarations and his\n\npreparedness for the hearing before the IJ leave much to be\n\ndesired, these deficiencies do not compel a finding that Hoxha was\n\npoorly represented but credible.               On the contrary, the record\n\nsupports the IJ's determination that the inconsistencies in this\n\ncase were so significant that the IJ was \"without recourse [] but\n\nto enter an adverse credibility finding.\"\n\n            Even       if   \"sloppy   drafting\"    were   to    blame   for    the\n\ndiscrepancy in the date of the fire that injured his son, Hoxha\n\n\n\n                                        -19-\n\fdoes not explain how poor drafting resulted in discrepancies in the\n\nmonth and even the year of certain other events, and in the\n\nomission of some events altogether.   In addition, while the record\n\nreflects that Hoxha had difficulty understanding English (he had an\n\ninterpreter at his hearing before the IJ, and he testified that an\n\ninterpreter filled out his application based on answers that he,\n\nvia his cousin, provided in Albanian); that he did not technically\n\nsign either declaration (his name is typewritten at the end of both\n\ndeclarations); and that his attorney was unaware of the existence\n\nof one of the two declarations, Hoxha twice acknowledged explicitly\n\nthat he knew of the two declarations.     He also answered in the\n\naffirmative when asked by both the IJ and the government whether he\n\nhad reviewed his asylum application with his attorney.   The record\n\nthus supports the IJ's determination that the inconsistencies in\n\nthis case pointed not to poor representation, but rather to a lack\n\nof credibility.\n\n                  c.   Other Measures of Credibility\n\n          Even if the inconsistencies in this case support an\n\nadverse credibility determination, Hoxha argues that \"consistency\n\nbetween written and oral statements is [only] one measure of\n\ncredibility. A reasonable factfinder could have evaluated [him] on\n\nthe plausibility of his story, his level of detail, [and] his\n\ndemeanor when testifying.\"   The IJ did consider other measures of\n\ncredibility before rendering the adverse credibility determination.\n\n\n\n                               -20-\n\fAt the outset of his analysis, the IJ stated that he \"had the\n\nopportunity to observe the respondent's demeanor throughout his\n\ntestimony and to compare that testimony to the written application\n\nand supporting documentation.\"          The IJ also acknowledged \"the\n\nexistence of documentation in the record that on its face seems to\n\nverify much of what the respondent has claimed happened,\" but noted\n\nthat the documents were not authenticated and that \"their mere\n\nexistence is insufficient to overcome the adverse credibility\n\nfinding.\"      While Hoxha \"could have attempted to rehabilitate his\n\ncredibility\" by coming forward with other corroborating evidence,\n\nthe IJ noted, he did not do so.        In addition, the IJ acknowledged\n\nthe plausibility of Hoxha's story, stating that \"[i]f credible,\n\nthere   is    certainly   nothing   inherently   implausible   about   the\n\nrespondent's claim, given the now evolving conditions in Albania.\"\n\n              Viewing the record as a whole, the IJ determined that the\n\nexistence of corroborating evidence, together with the plausibility\n\nof Hoxha's claim, were insufficient to overcome the IJ's \"serious\n\ndoubts\"      about   Hoxha's   credibility.   Given   the   \"significant\"\n\ndiscrepancies and omissions identified by the IJ in this case, the\n\nIJ did not err in finding that the evidence supported an adverse\n\ncredibility determination.\n\n              This case is therefore different from Osorio v. INS, 99\n\nF.3d 928 (9th Cir. 1996), cited by Hoxha, in which the Ninth\n\nCircuit remanded the BIA's denial of asylum in a case involving\n\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\finconsistent declarations.      In that case, neither the IJ, nor the\n\nBIA, which adopted the IJ's reasoning, \"identif[ied] the specific\n\ninconsistencies   on    which   they   based      their   finding   that   [the\n\napplicant] was not credible,\" nor did they give \"any indication of\n\nthe nature or gravity of the inconsistencies that they purported to\n\nrely upon.\"   Id. at 931-32.     Rather, the IJ merely stated that the\n\npetitioner was \"not credible\" based on \"inconsistencies\" stemming\n\nfrom a \"garbled and difficult to understand\" application, which,\n\nthe Osorio court noted, was \"clear[ly]\" not drafted by someone\n\nfluent in English.     Id. at 929, 931.      There was no indication, the\n\ncourt stated, that either the BIA or the IJ evaluated whether the\n\ninconsistencies in the applicant's first application \"may have been\n\nsimply the product of a language barrier or of a misreading of a\n\nlargely unintelligible document.\"         Id. at 932.\n\n           In this case, by contrast, the IJ listed the numerous\n\n\"significant\" and \"troubling\" inconsistencies upon which it relied\n\nfor its adverse credibility determination.            Unlike Osorio, the IJ\n\nalso   acknowledged    that   \"there   may   be    circumstances    where   an\n\nindividual's ability to recall dates and times would be in doubt,\n\nbut should not undermine the individual's credibility,\" such as\n\n\"when an individual is not represented by counsel, either in the\n\npreparation of the application or in Court.\"              Here, the IJ noted,\n\nHoxha was not only represented by counsel but also testified that\n\nhe had reviewed his asylum application with his attorney prior to\n\n\n\n                                   -22-\n\fthe hearing.         Lastly, while the declarations in this case were\n\nreplete with various grammatical and spelling errors, they were by\n\nno means unintelligible.             Therefore, the inconsistencies relied\n\nupon by the IJ, unlike those in Osorio, were not \"illusory,\" i.e.,\n\nthey were not \"simply the product of a language barrier or of a\n\nmisreading of a largely unintelligible document.\"            99 F.3d at 932.\n\n              3.       Convincing       Explanation     of        Discrepancies\n                       or Omissions\n\n              Hoxha argues that he provided reasonable explanations for\n\nthe various inconsistencies at the hearing before the IJ, and,\n\ntherefore,     the    IJ's   adverse    credibility   determination     is   not\n\nsupported by substantial evidence. Hoxha's argument is unavailing.\n\nWhen asked by the IJ why his two declarations listed different\n\ndates for the March 1998 fire at his father's home, Hoxha answered\n\nthat \"[m]aybe it was a mistake.\"           When asked by the government why\n\nhe did not mention the September 1999 admission by police to\n\nburning his father's home, Hoxha offered no explanation at all. He\n\nalso failed to give an explanation for why the date that he\n\ntestified he sold his store differed from the date provided in his\n\ndeclarations by almost a year.           When the IJ asked Hoxha why he did\n\nnot   amend    or    correct   his    asylum   application   to    clarify   the\n\ninconsistencies between his application and his testimony regarding\n\nthe date on which his son returned from the hospital in Greece,\n\nHoxha stated only that he was telling the truth, and that his\n\ntestimony was correct.         As the IJ states, not only did Hoxha not\n\n\n                                        -23-\n\faddress these discrepancies, \"but [he] seemed to not even know they\n\nexisted\"    –   despite   having   reviewed   his   application   with   his\n\nattorney.       The record therefore supports the IJ's determination\n\nthat Hoxha did not convincingly explain the inconsistencies in his\n\ncase.\n\nC.          Summary Affirmance\n\n            Hoxha argues that in affirming the IJ's decision without\n\nopinion, the BIA violated its summary affirmance procedure.          Under\n\nthis procedure,\n\n     [t]he Board member to whom a case is assigned shall\n     affirm the decision of the Service or the immigration\n     judge, without opinion, if the Board member determines\n     that the result reached in the decision under review was\n     correct; that any errors in the decision under review\n     were harmless or nonmaterial; and that\n\n     (A) The issues on appeal are squarely controlled by\n     existing Board or federal court precedent and do not\n     involve the application of precedent to a novel factual\n     situation; or\n\n     (B) The factual and legal issues raised on appeal are not\n     so substantial that the case warrants the issuance of a\n     written opinion in the case.\n\n8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(4)(i).\n\n            Hoxha argues that the BIA erred because its decision \"was\n\nbased upon an incorrect result reached by the IJ, and upon the IJ's\n\nerroneous conclusions of law and fact that were neither harmless\n\nnor nonmaterial.\"5     The government, on the other hand, argues that\n\n\n5\n  Hoxha does not argue that the issues on appeal in this case are\nnot controlled by existing precedent or that they involve the\napplication of precedent to a novel fact situation, nor does he\n\n                                    -24-\n\fthe BIA's decision to streamline a particular case is not subject\n\nto judicial review because the streamlining procedure is an action\n\ncommitted to the absolute discretion of the BIA.\n\n            We have previously acknowledged that we have jurisdiction\n\nto review the BIA's decision to streamline, at least in those cases\n\ninvolving both a reviewable and non-reviewable basis for the IJ's\n\ndecision, where it is unclear on what basis the BIA summarily\n\naffirmed the decision.            See Haoud v. Ashcroft, 350 F.3d 201, 206\n\n(1st Cir. 2003) (\"Especially when the Board's review of an IJ's\n\ndecision    often    hinges       on    Circuit    court    precedent,     we    are\n\nwell-equipped,      both    statutorily      and   practically,      to   review   a\n\ndecision to streamline.\").             Here, however, \"it makes no practical\n\ndifference whether the BIA properly or improperly streamlined\n\nreview\" since \"we can review directly the decision of the IJ.\"\n\nOlowo v.

Several months later, on June 19, 2002, Hoxha applied for asylum and withholding of removal, and for relief under the Convention Against Torture, asserting that he and his family were persecuted on account of his membership in the Democratic Party of Albania.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In support of his application, Hoxha submitted two declarations: one dated June 2002, and the other July 2002. In August 2002, the INS served Hoxha with a Notice to Appear, charging him with removeability under &#167; 237(a)(1)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227(a)(1)(A). On September 30, 2003, after hearing testimony on the merits of Hoxha's application, the IJ denied it and entered an order of removal to Albania. Specifically, the IJ made a negative credibility determination based on discrepancies between Hoxha's two declarations, and between those declarations and his in-court testimony. The BIA issued a summary affirmance without opinion on March 28, 2003.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Hoxha filed this petition, claiming that the IJ's decision, affirmed by the BIA, is not supported by substantial evidence, and that the BIA violated its own regulatory procedure by streamlining Hoxha's case and affirming the IJ's decision without opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We summarize the testimonial and documentary evidence that Hoxha presented to the IJ and then discuss the IJ's evaluation of that evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Summary of Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hoxha was born in Tirana, the capital of Albania, where he lived for approximately thirty-five years before coming to the United States. Hoxha was self-employed as the owner of a \"fast food business.\" In 1995, he joined the ruling Democratic Party of Albania, \"participat[ing] in every rally and meeting,\" contributing money, and \"help[ing] recruit[] young people, new people to increase the membership.\" The Democratic Party remained in power from March 1992 until June 1997, when the Socialist Party was elected. Hoxha's problems with the government then began.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 30, 1997, police beat Hoxha over the head with clubs while he attended a meeting in the public square protesting the Socialist Party's \"manipulation of the election that took place in June.\" Police arrested Hoxha, forced him into a car, and continued to beat him on the way to \"prison number 313.\" Once there, police beat Hoxha more severely, using their fists and clubs, and kicking him all over his body. Hoxha remained in custody overnight. The following day, police asked Hoxha to sign a document stating that he had participated in an illegal meeting, which he refused to do. Before releasing Hoxha, police told him not to attend any more meetings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following year, on March 31, 1998, a suspicious fire occurred at the home of Hoxha's father during a visit from Hoxha, his son Anxhelo, and several of Anxhelo's friends. Hoxha \"heard the children screaming\" and \"saw flames coming out of the room.\" His son \"had flames on his arm and another child also and my son's hands were taken afire.\" Hoxha took his son to the hospital, where his son remained for seventeen days.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 24, 1998, when Hoxha was returning from a Democratic Party rally, people in civilian clothing hit him \"very hard without any warning or saying anything,\" leaving him unconscious on the ground where he remained for several hours. Hoxha, accompanied by his wife, sought medical treatment at the hospital for his injuries. One year later, on September 12, 1999, police again arrested Hoxha at an \"illegal meeting\" of the Democratic Party. At the police station, police subjected Hoxha to \"very hard heavy physical violence,\" including beatings \"with rubber sticks and the butt of a gun.\" Hoxha explains that police \"cut my eyebrow, all the parts of my body, they were hitting me. They tied me to the chair. They were hitting me on the legs and on the head. . . .\" The police then told Hoxha that they had started the fire that injured his son, stating that \"for 45 years we are in power, we are going to kill you. Like we burned your house. We are going to try to burn your house. We are going to burn you out.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 22, 2000, at a Democratic Party meeting in the public square celebrating \"the anniversary of the victory of democracy,\" police arrested Hoxha and beat him in custody. Hoxha explains that police were \"pulling [his] hair\" and hitting him on the back, and that he \"was unconscious several time[s] from the police brutality.\" Police held him in custody overnight and released him the following day, warning him that if they saw him at any more meetings, he \"was the first one [they were] going to grab.\" The following month, three men in civilian clothing approached him on the street and began beating him. They \"told [him] to stop [his] political activities\" and then left him on the ground. On June 5, 2000, police approached Hoxha at a Democratic Party meeting and began punching him. According to Hoxha, \"[t]wo of them were holding me. One of them was punching me in the stomach with police clubs in the back.\" Hoxha received medical treatment for \"shock[] and [] depress[ion].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October of that year, Hoxha was chosen to represent the Democratic Party as a member of the commission charged with ensuring the fairness of the local mayoral elections. Hoxha began receiving anonymous and threatening phone calls and letters throughout the month, telling him that he \"should pull out . . . should resign as a member of the democratic party[], [and] threats against [his] children.\" Immediately following the elections, on his way out of the election office, Hoxha was attacked by several people \"dressed in civilian clothing,\" who thr[e]w [him] to the ground, \"hitting [him] hard, [with] heavy objects, [and] punching [him].\" Hoxha sought medical treatment at the hospital for a cut on the back of his head and received several stitches.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 26, 2000, police approached Hoxha and his wife in the public square as they protested the manipulation of the mayoral elections. One police officer \"threw [Hoxha] on the ground . . . punched [him], kicked [him] on the lip [and] punched him,\" while other officers hit his wife and pulled her hair. Police then handcuffed Hoxha and brought him and his wife to the police station, where they \"beat[] [him] with police clubs and kicking.\" Hoxha was \"bleeding very much,\" and police brought him to the hospital, where he received stitches for the cut on his lip. He was then brought back to the police station, where police questioned him about his participation in the illegal meeting and told him \"not to go to meetings anymore because they are illegal.\" Hoxha responded by telling the police that he would \"take them to court\" for beating him and his wife. The police released Hoxha and his wife after three days. Hoxha's wife \"had a swollen eye. In the face, they slapped her and they were pulling her hair in the cell.\" After his release, Hoxha filed a complaint with the local district attorney's office, but the complaint was never prosecuted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 24, 2001, Hoxha's house was hit with \"heavy machine guns,\" which injured his son, Anxhelo, whose \"left leg was bleeding.\" Hoxha and his wife took their son to the hospital, but were told that the hospital lacked \"conditions to operate on him,\" and that they should instead take their son to Greece to receive treatment. Hoxha arranged for his brother, who lived in Greece, to take Anxhelo to a hospital there. Anxhelo returned from Greece over a week later, on approximately February 3 or 4. Shortly thereafter, Hoxha decided to flee Albania.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 8, 2001, Hoxha sold his fast food business; the following month, he and his family left Tirana for Vlora, Albania. They remained in Vlora for over a year. During that time, in December 2001, Hoxha briefly returned to Tirana to discuss obtaining passports so that he and his family could leave Albania. While in Tirana, Hoxha attended a Democratic Party activity. During a lunch break, approximately four civilians attacked Hoxha as he sat with several friends at a coffee shop. According to Hoxha, \"I fell down and I was bleeding and they said &#8212; you are the one criticizing everywhere that you are going? &#8212; You forgot something that we are back in power son of the beach [sic].\" They then kicked him and beat him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 30, 2002, Hoxha and his family traveled by plane to Milan, Italy, and then to Montreal, Canada, where they arrived on March 31, 2002. That same day, Hoxha and his family crossed the Canadian border into the United States using passports provided by a smuggler, took a taxi to Albany, New York, and arrived in New York City by bus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hoxha also submitted numerous documentary sources in support of his application, including: two membership verifications for the Democratic Party; an alleged certificate from the district attorney of Tirana stating that Hoxha and his wife were \"mistreated by the police\" following a demonstration on October 26, 2000; a membership card from the Association of Ex-Politically Persecuted of Albania stating that he \"belonged to a persecuted family\"; a medical report from the University Hospital Center of Tirana regarding the treatment of Anxhelo Hoxha for burns; an alleged newspaper article dated May 25, 2001, regarding the persecution of Hoxha and his family; and the State Department's 2002 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for Albania, which reported that \"police beat and otherwise abused suspects, detainees and prisoners,\" and that police \"arbitrarily arrested and detained persons.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. IJ's Evaluation of Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ denied Hoxha's request for asylum, withholding of removal, and withholding under the Convention Against Torture, based on an adverse credibility determination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> In reaching this determination, the IJ recognized that \"a credibility assessment is not reducible to a finite formula, and that all factors must be considered both individually and cumulatively.\" While \"mere trivial errors or errors incidental to a claim are insufficient for an adverse credibility finding,\" the IJ reasoned, \"discrepancies and omissions [that] cumulatively go to the heart of the claim or otherwise show testimony ultimately dubious\" support such a finding. Where these discrepancies and omissions exist, the IJ noted, \"the three prong test of [<i>In re A____ S____,</i> 21 I &amp; N Dec. 1106, 1109 (BIA 1998)], must also be met,\" that is,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) the discrepancies and omissions described by the Immigration Judge must actually be present in the record;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) the discrepancies and omissions must provide specific and cogent reasons to conclude that the alien provided incredible testimony; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) a convincing explanation for the discrepancies or omissions must not have been supplied by the alien.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even where these credibility factors are present, the IJ noted that \"there may be circumstances where an individual's ability to recall dates and times would be in doubt, but should not undermine the individual's credibility.\" These circumstances include where an individual has \"suffered traumatic occurrences distant in time and in a manner that can impair his ability to provide chronologically cogent and persuasive testimony,\" or where an individual who \"is not represented by counsel, either in the preparation of the application or in Court,\" is \"unartful\" in the presentation of his case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ determined that, in light of all of these factors, \"[t]he discrepancies and omissions in this case are significant, and cause this Court to have so [sic] serious doubts about the respondent's credibility that the Court is without recourse, but to enter an adverse credibility finding.\" In making this determination, the IJ noted numerous inconsistencies between Hoxha's two declarations, and between those declarations and his in-court testimony. Hoxha's first declaration does not reference the March 31, 1998 fire that injured his son, and the second declaration states that the fire occurred on March 3, not March 31, 1998. Neither declaration mentions that during the September 12, 1999 incident, police admitted to setting the fire. While Hoxha's testimony and second declaration both refer to his being beaten following the mayoral elections in October 2000, Hoxha's first declaration states that the elections took place one year later in October 2001. In addition, neither declaration mentions the October 26, 2000 incident in which police beat and detained Hoxha and his wife.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ found \"very significant . . . the fact that the respondent was unequivocal that he says that he sold his business on February 8, 2001, while both declarations indicate that the respondent's business was sold by him in August of 2000.\" The IJ also noted the \"drastically different\" reasons that Hoxha gave for selling his business: Hoxha testified that he sold his business shortly after his son was injured by heavy artillery and was sent to Greece for treatment, while \"in both declarations, the respondent stated that the business was sold after they were constantly being threatened by the secret service.\" The IJ also found \"very significant\" the discrepancy surrounding the date on which Hoxha's son returned from Greece after receiving medical treatment. According to the IJ, \"[t]he respondent was clear that his son returned from Greece in early February perhaps February 4, 2001, while both declarations state that his son returned on March 4, 2001.\" Lastly, the IJ notes that unlike his second declaration and testimony, Hoxha's first declaration does not mention the December 2001 incident in which he was attacked by several civilians upon returning to Tirana.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ stated that he was also troubled by the fact that Hoxha's attorney knew of only one of the two declarations submitted by Hoxha and thus knew nothing of the inconsistencies between the two. By failing to address these inconsistencies in a supplemental or amended application prior to the hearing before the IJ, Hoxha's attorney \"effectively ratified one or both declarations that existed in this record.\" In addition, while Hoxha claimed that he went over his application with his attorney, neither Hoxha nor his attorney seemed to know of the inconsistencies between the declarations and the testimony that Hoxha planned to give at the hearing before the IJ. As a result, the IJ noted, Hoxha made no attempt at the hearing to address the inconsistencies between his two declarations and between the declarations and his testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on this evidence, the IJ determined that he could not enter a favorable credibility finding. \"[D]espite the existence of documentation in the record that on its face seems to verify much of what the respondent has claimed happened,\" the IJ stated that the documents proffered by Hoxha were \"not authenticated and their mere existence is insufficient to overcome the adverse credibility finding. . . .\" In addition, the IJ noted that Hoxha did not attempt to rehabilitate his credibility by providing corroborating evidence, such as documentation of his son's medical treatment in Greece or his own medical treatment in Tirana. \"If credible,\" the IJ noted,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">there is certainly nothing inherently implausible about the respondent's claim, given the now evolving conditions in Albania. However, on this record, the Court finds that the respondent has not met his burden of proof and persuasion, in that he has not presented an adequately credible claim in light of the content of his testimony and the discrepancies that exist both between his testimony and the declarations, as well as to each declaration itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

Relying upon the BIA's three-prong test for evaluating credibility set forth in <i>In re A____ S____,</i> the IJ found (1) discrepancies and inconsistencies in the record (2) which provided specific, cogent reasons for an adverse credibility determination, and (3) which were not adequately explained by Hoxha.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.

The numerous inconsistencies between Hoxha's two declarations, and between the declarations and Hoxha's sworn testimony, closely relate to this alleged persecution. These inconsistencies include: discrepancies surrounding the date on which police set fire to Hoxha's home and omissions concerning whether police admitted setting the fire; discrepancies surrounding the year in which Hoxha was beaten following his participation in the mayoral elections; omissions concerning whether Hoxha and his wife were beaten and detained by police in October 2000; discrepancies surrounding the year in which Hoxha sold his business and his reasons for selling it; discrepancies surrounding the date on which Hoxha's son returned from the hospital after being injured by artillery fired at Hoxha's home; and omissions concerning whether Hoxha was beaten by civilians after briefly returning to Tirana in December 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Far from trivial, the numerous inconsistencies cited by the IJ involve the heart of Hoxha's asylum claim and thus support the IJ's adverse credibility finding. <i>Compare Bojorques-Villanueva,</i> 194 F.3d at 17 (holding that the BIA's adverse credibility finding was supported by substantial evidence where \"the inconsistencies noted by the Board were more than several and more than minor, such as an error in dates or typographical error\" and \"the multiple inconsistencies went to the central facts,\" i.e., \"the where, the who, the when and the what\" of the triggering event), <i>and In re A____ S____ ,</i> 21 I &amp; N Dec. at 1110 (holding that \"the omission of key events [] coupled with numerous [date] inconsistencies,\" was a \"specific and cogent reason supporting the [IJ]'s adverse credibility finding\"), <i>with Vilorio-Lopez v. INS,</i> 852 F.2d 1137, 1142 (9th Cir.1988) (\"Minor inconsistencies in the record such as discrepancies in dates which reveal nothing about an asylum applicant's fear for his safety are not an adequate basis for an adverse credibility finding.\"), <i>and Martinez-Sanchez v. INS,</i> 794 F.2d 1396, 1400 (9th Cir.1986) (holding that two \"trivial errors\" in an otherwise consistent record \"did not constitute a valid ground upon which to base a finding that an asylum applicant is not credible\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>b. Legitimate Nexus</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hoxha further argues that \"even assuming that some of the discrepancies contained in the written statements involved matters central to [his] asylum claim,\" these discrepancies bear no \"legitimate nexus\" to the IJ's adverse credibility finding. \"A reasonable factfinder upon review of the entire record,\" Hoxha contends, \"would be compelled to conclude that the discrepancies in the statements indicated not negative credibility, but sloppy and irresponsible lawyering.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of this argument, Hoxha notes that both declarations were \"written in broken English replete with grammatical and spelling errors, typos, and long passages of boilerplate legal language unrelated to [his] specific asylum claim.\" Many of the discrepancies in dates, Hoxha argues, \"seem indicative of typographical errors rather than lack of credibility,\" such as where the June 2002 declaration erroneously states that the fire at the home of Hoxha's father started on \"March 3, 1998\" instead of on March 31, 1998. Hoxha also contends that he was wholly unprepared for questioning regarding the inconsistencies between his first and second declarations, and between those declarations and his testimony, because his lawyer did not review the declarations with him prior to the hearing before the IJ. Hoxha supports this contention by noting that he did not sign either declaration; both declarations are in English, which he could not read; and neither he nor his attorney were aware of the existence of a second declaration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An IJ's reasons for rejecting an applicant's testimony on credibility grounds must \"bear a legitimate nexus\" to the adverse credibility finding. <i>Secaida,</i> 331 F.3d at 307. We find such a nexus here. While the contents of Hoxha's declarations and his preparedness for the hearing before the IJ leave much to be desired, these deficiencies do not compel a finding that Hoxha was poorly represented but credible. On the contrary, the record supports the IJ's determination that the inconsistencies in this case were so significant that the IJ was \"without recourse [] but to enter an adverse credibility finding.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if \"sloppy drafting\" were to blame for the discrepancy in the date of the fire that injured his son, Hoxha does not explain how poor drafting resulted in discrepancies in the month and even the year of certain other events, and in the omission of some events altogether. In addition, while the record reflects that Hoxha had difficulty understanding English (he had an interpreter at his hearing before the IJ, and he testified that an interpreter filled out his application based on answers that he, via his cousin, provided in Albanian); that he did not technically sign either declaration (his name is typewritten at the end of both declarations); and that his attorney was unaware of the existence of one of the two declarations, Hoxha twice acknowledged explicitly that he knew of the two declarations. He also answered in the affirmative when asked by both the IJ and the government whether he had reviewed his asylum application with his attorney. The record thus supports the IJ's determination that the inconsistencies in this case pointed not to poor representation, but rather to a lack of credibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>c. Other Measures of Credibility</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the inconsistencies in this case support an adverse credibility determination, Hoxha argues that \"consistency between written and oral statements is [only] one measure of credibility. A reasonable factfinder could have evaluated [him] on the plausibility of his story, his level of detail, [and] his demeanor when testifying.\" The IJ did consider other measures of credibility before rendering the adverse credibility determination. At the outset of his analysis, the IJ stated that he \"had the opportunity to observe the respondent's demeanor throughout his testimony and to compare that testimony to the written application and supporting documentation.\" The IJ also acknowledged \"the existence of documentation in the record that on its face seems to verify much of what the respondent has claimed happened,\" but noted that the documents were not authenticated and that \"their mere existence is insufficient to overcome the adverse credibility finding.\" While Hoxha \"could have attempted to rehabilitate his credibility\" by coming forward with other corroborating evidence, the IJ noted, he did not do so. In addition, the IJ acknowledged the plausibility of Hoxha's story, stating that \"[i]f credible, there is certainly nothing inherently implausible about the respondent's claim, given the now evolving conditions in Albania.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewing the record as a whole, the IJ determined that the existence of corroborating evidence, together with the plausibility of Hoxha's claim, were insufficient to overcome the IJ's \"serious doubts\" about Hoxha's credibility. Given the \"significant\" discrepancies and omissions identified by the IJ in this case, the IJ did not err in finding that the evidence supported an adverse credibility determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case is therefore different from <i>Osorio v. INS,</i> 99 F.3d 928 (9th Cir.1996), cited by Hoxha, in which the Ninth Circuit remanded the BIA's denial of asylum in a case involving inconsistent declarations. In that case, neither the IJ, nor the BIA, which adopted the IJ's reasoning, \"identif[ied] the specific inconsistencies on which they based their finding that [the applicant] was not credible,\" nor did they give \"any indication of the nature or gravity of the inconsistencies that they purported to rely upon.\" <i>Id.</i> at 931-32. Rather, the IJ merely stated that the petitioner was \"not credible\" based on \"inconsistencies\" stemming from a \"garbled and difficult to understand\" application, which, the <i>Osorio</i> court noted, was \"clear[ly]\" not drafted by someone fluent in English. <i>Id.</i> at 929, 931. There was no indication, the court stated, that either the BIA or the IJ evaluated whether the inconsistencies in the applicant's first application \"may have been simply the product of a language barrier or of a misreading of a largely unintelligible document.\" <i>Id.</i> at 932.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, by contrast, the IJ listed the numerous \"significant\" and \"troubling\" inconsistencies upon which it relied for its adverse credibility determination. Unlike <i>Osorio,</i> the IJ also acknowledged that \"there may be circumstances where an individual's ability to recall dates and times would be in doubt, but should not undermine the individual's credibility,\" such as \"when an individual is not represented by counsel, either in the preparation of the application or in Court.\" Here, the IJ noted, Hoxha was not only represented by counsel but also testified that he had reviewed his asylum application with his attorney prior to the hearing. Lastly, while the declarations in this case were replete with various grammatical and spelling errors, they were by no means unintelligible. Therefore, the inconsistencies relied upon by the IJ, unlike those in <i>Osorio,</i> were not \"illusory,\" i.e., they were not \"simply the product of a language barrier or of a misreading of a largely unintelligible document.\" 99 F.3d at 932.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Convincing Explanation of Discrepancies or Omissions</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hoxha argues that he provided reasonable explanations for the various inconsistencies at the hearing before the IJ, and, therefore, the IJ's adverse credibility determination is not supported by substantial evidence. Hoxha's argument is unavailing. When asked by the IJ why his two declarations listed different dates for the March 1998 fire at his father's home, Hoxha answered that \"[m]aybe it was a mistake.\" When asked by the government why he did not mention the September 1999 admission by police to burning his father's home, Hoxha offered no explanation at all. He also failed to give an explanation for why the date that he testified he sold his store differed from the date provided in his declarations by almost a year. When the IJ asked Hoxha why he did not amend or correct his asylum application to clarify the inconsistencies between his application and his testimony regarding the date on which his son returned from the hospital in Greece, Hoxha stated only that he was telling the truth, and that his testimony was correct. As the IJ states, not only did Hoxha not address these discrepancies, \"but [he] seemed to not even know they existed\" &#8212; despite having reviewed his application with his attorney. The record therefore supports the IJ's determination that Hoxha did not convincingly explain the inconsistencies in his case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.

Ashcroft,</i> 350 F.3d 201, 206 (1st Cir.2003) (\"Especially when the Board's review of an IJ's decision often hinges on Circuit court precedent, we are well-equipped, both statutorily and practically, to review a decision to streamline.\"). Here, however, \"it makes no practical difference whether the BIA properly or improperly streamlined review\" since \"we can review directly the decision of the IJ.\" <i>Olowo v. Ashcroft,</i> 368 F.3d 692, 698 (7th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <i>see also Falcon Carriche v.

Because we find the IJ's adverse credibility determination clearly supported by substantial evidence in the record, we dispose of Hoxha's argument without reaching whether the BIA's affirmance of the IJ's adverse credibility determination under the summary affirmance procedure was error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA's order is <i>affirmed;</i> the petition for review is <i>denied.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Hoxha's wife and children are derivatives listed on his asylum application</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> \"Where, as here, the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ, we review the decision of the IJ.\"<i>Mihaylov v.

Several months later, on June 19, 2002, Hoxha applied for asylum and withholding of removal, and for relief under the Convention Against Torture, asserting that he and his family were persecuted on account of his membership in the Democratic Party of Albania.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In support of his application, Hoxha submitted two declarations: one dated June 2002, and the other July 2002. In August 2002, the INS served Hoxha with a Notice to Appear, charging him with removeability under &#167; 237(a)(1)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227(a)(1)(A). On September 30, 2003, after hearing testimony on the merits of Hoxha's application, the IJ denied it and entered an order of removal to Albania.

Summary of Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hoxha was born in Tirana, the capital of Albania, where he lived for approximately thirty-five years before coming to the United States. Hoxha was self-employed as the owner of a \"fast food business.\" In 1995, he joined the ruling Democratic Party of Albania, \"participat[ing] in every rally and meeting,\" contributing money, and \"help[ing] recruit[] young people, new people to increase the membership.\" The Democratic Party remained in power from March 1992 until June 1997, when the Socialist Party was elected. Hoxha's problems with the government then began.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 30, 1997, police beat Hoxha over the head with clubs while he attended a meeting in the public square protesting the Socialist Party's \"manipulation of the election that took place in June.\" Police arrested Hoxha, forced him into a car, and continued to beat him on the way to \"prison number 313.\" Once there, police beat Hoxha more severely, using their fists and clubs, and kicking him all over his body. Hoxha remained in custody overnight. The following day, police asked Hoxha to sign a document stating that he had participated in an illegal meeting, which he refused to do. Before releasing Hoxha, police told him not to attend any more meetings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following year, on March 31, 1998, a suspicious fire occurred at the home of Hoxha's father during a visit from Hoxha, his son Anxhelo, and several of Anxhelo's friends. Hoxha \"heard the children screaming\" and \"saw flames coming out of the room.\" His son \"had flames on his arm and another child also and my son's hands were taken afire.\" Hoxha took his son to the hospital, where his son remained for seventeen days.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 24, 1998, when Hoxha was returning from a Democratic Party rally, people in civilian clothing hit him \"very hard without any warning or saying anything,\" leaving him unconscious on the ground where he remained for several hours. Hoxha, accompanied by his wife, sought medical treatment at the hospital for his injuries. One year later, on September 12, 1999, police again arrested Hoxha at an \"illegal meeting\" of the Democratic Party. At the police station, police subjected Hoxha to \"very hard heavy physical violence,\" including beatings \"with rubber sticks and the butt of a gun.\" Hoxha explains that police \"cut my eyebrow, all the parts of my body, they were hitting me. They tied me to the chair. They were hitting me on the legs and on the head. . . .\" The police then told Hoxha that they had started the fire that injured his son, stating that \"for 45 years we are in power, we are going to kill you. Like we burned your house. We are going to try to burn your house. We are going to burn you out.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 22, 2000, at a Democratic Party meeting in the public square celebrating \"the anniversary of the victory of democracy,\" police arrested Hoxha and beat him in custody. Hoxha explains that police were \"pulling [his] hair\" and hitting him on the back, and that he \"was unconscious several time[s] from the police brutality.\" Police held him in custody overnight and released him the following day, warning him that if they saw him at any more meetings, he \"was the first one [they were] going to grab.\" The following month, three men in civilian clothing approached him on the street and began beating him. They \"told [him] to stop [his] political activities\" and then left him on the ground. On June 5, 2000, police approached Hoxha at a Democratic Party meeting and began punching him. According to Hoxha, \"[t]wo of them were holding me. One of them was punching me in the stomach with police clubs in the back.\" Hoxha received medical treatment for \"shock[] and [] depress[ion].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October of that year, Hoxha was chosen to represent the Democratic Party as a member of the commission charged with ensuring the fairness of the local mayoral elections. Hoxha began receiving anonymous and threatening phone calls and letters throughout the month, telling him that he \"should pull out . . . should resign as a member of the democratic party[], [and] threats against [his] children.\" Immediately following the elections, on his way out of the election office, Hoxha was attacked by several people \"dressed in civilian clothing,\" who thr[e]w [him] to the ground, \"hitting [him] hard, [with] heavy objects, [and] punching [him].\" Hoxha sought medical treatment at the hospital for a cut on the back of his head and received several stitches.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 26, 2000, police approached Hoxha and his wife in the public square as they protested the manipulation of the mayoral elections. One police officer \"threw [Hoxha] on the ground . . . punched [him], kicked [him] on the lip [and] punched him,\" while other officers hit his wife and pulled her hair. Police then handcuffed Hoxha and brought him and his wife to the police station, where they \"beat[] [him] with police clubs and kicking.\" Hoxha was \"bleeding very much,\" and police brought him to the hospital, where he received stitches for the cut on his lip. He was then brought back to the police station, where police questioned him about his participation in the illegal meeting and told him \"not to go to meetings anymore because they are illegal.\" Hoxha responded by telling the police that he would \"take them to court\" for beating him and his wife. The police released Hoxha and his wife after three days. Hoxha's wife \"had a swollen eye.

Hoxha arranged for his brother, who lived in Greece, to take Anxhelo to a hospital there. Anxhelo returned from Greece over a week later, on approximately February 3 or 4. Shortly thereafter, Hoxha decided to flee Albania.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 8, 2001, Hoxha sold his fast food business; the following month, he and his family left Tirana for Vlora, Albania. They remained in Vlora for over a year. During that time, in December 2001, Hoxha briefly returned to Tirana to discuss obtaining passports so that he and his family could leave Albania. While in Tirana, Hoxha attended a Democratic Party activity. During a lunch break, approximately four civilians attacked Hoxha as he sat with several friends at a coffee shop. According to Hoxha, \"I fell down and I was bleeding and they said &#8212; you are the one criticizing everywhere that you are going? &#8212; You forgot something that we are back in power son of the beach [sic].\" They then kicked him and beat him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 30, 2002, Hoxha and his family traveled by plane to Milan, Italy, and then to Montreal, Canada, where they arrived on March 31, 2002.

IJ's Evaluation of Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ denied Hoxha's request for asylum, withholding of removal, and withholding under the Convention Against Torture, based on an adverse credibility determination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> In reaching this determination, the IJ recognized that \"a credibility assessment is not reducible to a finite formula, and that all factors must be considered both individually and cumulatively.\" While \"mere trivial errors or errors incidental to a claim are insufficient for an adverse credibility finding,\" the IJ reasoned, \"discrepancies and omissions [that] cumulatively go to the heart of the claim or otherwise show testimony ultimately dubious\" support such a finding. Where these discrepancies and omissions exist, the IJ noted, \"the three prong test of [<i>In re A____ S____,</i> 21 I &amp; N Dec. 1106, 1109 (BIA 1998)], must also be met,\" that is,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) the discrepancies and omissions described by the Immigration Judge must actually be present in the record;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) the discrepancies and omissions must provide specific and cogent reasons to conclude that the alien provided incredible testimony; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) a convincing explanation for the discrepancies or omissions must not have been supplied by the alien.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even where these credibility factors are present, the IJ noted that \"there may be circumstances where an individual's ability to recall dates and times would be in doubt, but should not undermine the individual's credibility.\" These circumstances include where an individual has \"suffered traumatic occurrences distant in time and in a manner that can impair his ability to provide chronologically cogent and persuasive testimony,\" or where an individual who \"is not represented by counsel, either in the preparation of the application or in Court,\" is \"unartful\" in the presentation of his case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ determined that, in light of all of these factors, \"[t]he discrepancies and omissions in this case are significant, and cause this Court to have so [sic] serious doubts about the respondent's credibility that the Court is without recourse, but to enter an adverse credibility finding.\" In making this determination, the IJ noted numerous inconsistencies between Hoxha's two declarations, and between those declarations and his in-court testimony. Hoxha's first declaration does not reference the March 31, 1998 fire that injured his son, and the second declaration states that the fire occurred on March 3, not March 31, 1998. Neither declaration mentions that during the September 12, 1999 incident, police admitted to setting the fire. While Hoxha's testimony and second declaration both refer to his being beaten following the mayoral elections in October 2000, Hoxha's first declaration states that the elections took place one year later in October 2001. In addition, neither declaration mentions the October 26, 2000 incident in which police beat and detained Hoxha and his wife.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ found \"very significant . . . the fact that the respondent was unequivocal that he says that he sold his business on February 8, 2001, while both declarations indicate that the respondent's business was sold by him in August of 2000.\" The IJ also noted the \"drastically different\" reasons that Hoxha gave for selling his business: Hoxha testified that he sold his business shortly after his son was injured by heavy artillery and was sent to Greece for treatment, while \"in both declarations, the respondent stated that the business was sold after they were constantly being threatened by the secret service.\" The IJ also found \"very significant\" the discrepancy surrounding the date on which Hoxha's son returned from Greece after receiving medical treatment. According to the IJ, \"[t]he respondent was clear that his son returned from Greece in early February perhaps February 4, 2001, while both declarations state that his son returned on March 4, 2001.\" Lastly, the IJ notes that unlike his second declaration and testimony, Hoxha's first declaration does not mention the December 2001 incident in which he was attacked by several civilians upon returning to Tirana.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ stated that he was also troubled by the fact that Hoxha's attorney knew of only one of the two declarations submitted by Hoxha and thus knew nothing of the inconsistencies between the two. By failing to address these inconsistencies in a supplemental or amended application prior to the hearing before the IJ, Hoxha's attorney \"effectively ratified one or both declarations that existed in this record.\" In addition, while Hoxha claimed that he went over his application with his attorney, neither Hoxha nor his attorney seemed to know of the inconsistencies between the declarations and the testimony that Hoxha planned to give at the hearing before the IJ. As a result, the IJ noted, Hoxha made no attempt at the hearing to address the inconsistencies between his two declarations and between the declarations and his testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on this evidence, the IJ determined that he could not enter a favorable credibility finding. \"[D]espite the existence of documentation in the record that on its face seems to verify much of what the respondent has claimed happened,\" the IJ stated that the documents proffered by Hoxha were \"not authenticated and their mere existence is insufficient to overcome the adverse credibility finding. . . .\" In addition, the IJ noted that Hoxha did not attempt to rehabilitate his credibility by providing corroborating evidence, such as documentation of his son's medical treatment in Greece or his own medical treatment in Tirana. \"If credible,\" the IJ noted,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">there is certainly nothing inherently implausible about the respondent's claim, given the now evolving conditions in Albania.

The numerous inconsistencies between Hoxha's two declarations, and between the declarations and Hoxha's sworn testimony, closely relate to this alleged persecution. These inconsistencies include: discrepancies surrounding the date on which police set fire to Hoxha's home and omissions concerning whether police admitted setting the fire; discrepancies surrounding the year in which Hoxha was beaten following his participation in the mayoral elections; omissions concerning whether Hoxha and his wife were beaten and detained by police in October 2000; discrepancies surrounding the year in which Hoxha sold his business and his reasons for selling it; discrepancies surrounding the date on which Hoxha's son returned from the hospital after being injured by artillery fired at Hoxha's home; and omissions concerning whether Hoxha was beaten by civilians after briefly returning to Tirana in December 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Far from trivial, the numerous inconsistencies cited by the IJ involve the heart of Hoxha's asylum claim and thus support the IJ's adverse credibility finding. <i>Compare Bojorques-Villanueva,</i> 194 F.3d at 17 (holding that the BIA's adverse credibility finding was supported by substantial evidence where \"the inconsistencies noted by the Board were more than several and more than minor, such as an error in dates or typographical error\" and \"the multiple inconsistencies went to the central facts,\" i.e., \"the where, the who, the when and the what\" of the triggering event), <i>and In re A____ S____ ,</i> 21 I &amp; N Dec. at 1110 (holding that \"the omission of key events [] coupled with numerous [date] inconsistencies,\" was a \"specific and cogent reason supporting the [IJ]'s adverse credibility finding\"), <i>with Vilorio-Lopez v.

Hoxha also contends that he was wholly unprepared for questioning regarding the inconsistencies between his first and second declarations, and between those declarations and his testimony, because his lawyer did not review the declarations with him prior to the hearing before the IJ. Hoxha supports this contention by noting that he did not sign either declaration; both declarations are in English, which he could not read; and neither he nor his attorney were aware of the existence of a second declaration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An IJ's reasons for rejecting an applicant's testimony on credibility grounds must \"bear a legitimate nexus\" to the adverse credibility finding. <i>Secaida,</i> 331 F.3d at 307. We find such a nexus here. While the contents of Hoxha's declarations and his preparedness for the hearing before the IJ leave much to be desired, these deficiencies do not compel a finding that Hoxha was poorly represented but credible. On the contrary, the record supports the IJ's determination that the inconsistencies in this case were so significant that the IJ was \"without recourse [] but to enter an adverse credibility finding.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if \"sloppy drafting\" were to blame for the discrepancy in the date of the fire that injured his son, Hoxha does not explain how poor drafting resulted in discrepancies in the month and even the year of certain other events, and in the omission of some events altogether. In addition, while the record reflects that Hoxha had difficulty understanding English (he had an interpreter at his hearing before the IJ, and he testified that an interpreter filled out his application based on answers that he, via his cousin, provided in Albanian); that he did not technically sign either declaration (his name is typewritten at the end of both declarations); and that his attorney was unaware of the existence of one of the two declarations, Hoxha twice acknowledged explicitly that he knew of the two declarations. He also answered in the affirmative when asked by both the IJ and the government whether he had reviewed his asylum application with his attorney. The record thus supports the IJ's determination that the inconsistencies in this case pointed not to poor representation, but rather to a lack of credibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>c. Other Measures of Credibility</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the inconsistencies in this case support an adverse credibility determination, Hoxha argues that \"consistency between written and oral statements is [only] one measure of credibility. A reasonable factfinder could have evaluated [him] on the plausibility of his story, his level of detail, [and] his demeanor when testifying.\" The IJ did consider other measures of credibility before rendering the adverse credibility determination. At the outset of his analysis, the IJ stated that he \"had the opportunity to observe the respondent's demeanor throughout his testimony and to compare that testimony to the written application and supporting documentation.\" The IJ also acknowledged \"the existence of documentation in the record that on its face seems to verify much of what the respondent has claimed happened,\" but noted that the documents were not authenticated and that \"their mere existence is insufficient to overcome the adverse credibility finding.\" While Hoxha \"could have attempted to rehabilitate his credibility\" by coming forward with other corroborating evidence, the IJ noted, he did not do so. In addition, the IJ acknowledged the plausibility of Hoxha's story, stating that \"[i]f credible, there is certainly nothing inherently implausible about the respondent's claim, given the now evolving conditions in Albania.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewing the record as a whole, the IJ determined that the existence of corroborating evidence, together with the plausibility of Hoxha's claim, were insufficient to overcome the IJ's \"serious doubts\" about Hoxha's credibility. Given the \"significant\" discrepancies and omissions identified by the IJ in this case, the IJ did not err in finding that the evidence supported an adverse credibility determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case is therefore different from <i>Osorio v.

In that case, neither the IJ, nor the BIA, which adopted the IJ's reasoning, \"identif[ied] the specific inconsistencies on which they based their finding that [the applicant] was not credible,\" nor did they give \"any indication of the nature or gravity of the inconsistencies that they purported to rely upon.\" <i>Id.</i> at 931-32. Rather, the IJ merely stated that the petitioner was \"not credible\" based on \"inconsistencies\" stemming from a \"garbled and difficult to understand\" application, which, the <i>Osorio</i> court noted, was \"clear[ly]\" not drafted by someone fluent in English. <i>Id.</i> at 929, 931. There was no indication, the court stated, that either the BIA or the IJ evaluated whether the inconsistencies in the applicant's first application \"may have been simply the product of a language barrier or of a misreading of a largely unintelligible document.\" <i>Id.</i> at 932.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, by contrast, the IJ listed the numerous \"significant\" and \"troubling\" inconsistencies upon which it relied for its adverse credibility determination. Unlike <i>Osorio,</i> the IJ also acknowledged that \"there may be circumstances where an individual's ability to recall dates and times would be in doubt, but should not undermine the individual's credibility,\" such as \"when an individual is not represented by counsel, either in the preparation of the application or in Court.\" Here, the IJ noted, Hoxha was not only represented by counsel but also testified that he had reviewed his asylum application with his attorney prior to the hearing. Lastly, while the declarations in this case were replete with various grammatical and spelling errors, they were by no means unintelligible. Therefore, the inconsistencies relied upon by the IJ, unlike those in <i>Osorio,</i> were not \"illusory,\" i.e., they were not \"simply the product of a language barrier or of a misreading of a largely unintelligible document.\" 99 F.3d at 932.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3.

Hoxha's argument is unavailing. When asked by the IJ why his two declarations listed different dates for the March 1998 fire at his father's home, Hoxha answered that \"[m]aybe it was a mistake.\" When asked by the government why he did not mention the September 1999 admission by police to burning his father's home, Hoxha offered no explanation at all. He also failed to give an explanation for why the date that he testified he sold his store differed from the date provided in his declarations by almost a year. When the IJ asked Hoxha why he did not amend or correct his asylum application to clarify the inconsistencies between his application and his testimony regarding the date on which his son returned from the hospital in Greece, Hoxha stated only that he was telling the truth, and that his testimony was correct. As the IJ states, not only did Hoxha not address these discrepancies, \"but [he] seemed to not even know they existed\" &#8212; despite having reviewed his application with his attorney. The record therefore supports the IJ's determination that Hoxha did not convincingly explain the inconsistencies in his case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.
