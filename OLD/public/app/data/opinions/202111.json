Vanderstar, Trial Attorney, Peter D. Keisler,\nAssistant Attorney General, and Christopher C. Fuller, Senior\nLitigation Counsel, on brief for respondent.\n\n\n\n\n                           March 23, 2006\n\f            CYR, Senior Circuit Judge.              In 1994, petitioner Claudio\n\nRodriguez   Del   Carmen,      a    native    and   citizen     of    the    Dominican\n\nRepublic,   married      Awilda     Sepulveda       Benitez,    a    United    States\n\ncitizen.    In 1996, he was admitted for permanent residence on a\n\nconditional basis.       See 8 U.S.C. § 1186a.          In 1997, Rodriguez and\n\nSepulveda   jointly      submitted     a     petition   to    remove    Rodriguez's\n\nconditional status.       In 1999, they were divorced.                The following\n\nyear, the conditional status was removed, and Rodriguez was granted\n\nlawful permanent resident status.\n\n            In 2001, two Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)\n\nagents interviewed Sepulveda, who stated under oath, on audiotape,\n\nthat Rodriguez had paid her $1500 to marry him and that they\n\nneither lived together nor had marital relations.                    On the day that\n\nSepulveda had filed her affidavit in support of Rodriguez’ petition\n\nto become a lawful permanent resident, she and Rodriguez jointly\n\nopened a bank account with a $1500 balance.                      During the 2001\n\ninterview, Sepulveda executed an acknowledgment and waiver of\n\nrights, and repeatedly stated that the INS agents had made no\n\npromises or threats to procure her statement.\n\n            The Department of Homeland Security (“the Department”)\n\ncommenced proceedings to deport Rodriguez, see id. § 1227(a)(1)(A),\n\nalleging inter alia that he had procured permanent resident status\n\nby   entering     into     a       fraudulent       marriage.          See     id.   §\n\n1182(a)(6)(C)(i).        At the deportation hearing, the Department\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fintroduced Sepulveda’s sworn statement in evidence.                 However,\n\nSepulveda testified that her sworn statement was false, that she\n\nsuffered from “psychological problems,” and that the INS agents had\n\ncoerced her into making the sworn statements by threatening to take\n\nher children away from her unless she incriminated Rodriguez.\n\nAlthough Sepulveda now contends that her marriage with Rodriguez\n\nhad been bona fide, she was unable to testify to important details\n\nregarding their marital arrangement, such as the address of their\n\njoint habitation and the names of Rodriguez' parents.               Sepulveda\n\nconceded that, after their marriage, Rodriguez had left her and\n\nrelocated to the Dominican Republic for about three years.                 The\n\ninterviewing INS agent testified in rebuttal that he never made any\n\nthreats   regarding    the   Sepulveda    children,   and   that    Sepulveda\n\nrepeatedly acknowledged throughout her 2001 interview that her\n\nstatements were voluntary.\n\n           In due course, the immigration judge (“IJ”) ruled that\n\nRodriguez had entered into a fraudulent marriage, thereby rendering\n\nhim ineligible for permanent resident status. On appeal, the Board\n\nof Immigration Appeals adopted and affirmed the IJ’s decision.\n\nRodriguez petitions for review.\n\n           Rodriguez    contends   that    the   IJ   erred,   in   that   the\n\nrejection of the Sepulveda in-court recantation cannot suffice,\n\nstanding alone, to establish that the marriage was fraudulent, and\n\nalso because the record contained other undisputed evidence (e.g.,\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\flove letters) demonstrating that the marriage was valid.\n\n           We review the IJ’s finding – that the Rodriguez marriage\n\nto Sepulveda was fraudulent – in order to determine whether it is\n\nsupported by “substantial evidence,” and we will uphold it unless\n\nthe record would compel a contrary finding.          See Ang v. Gonzales,\n\n430 F.3d 50, 54-55 (1st Cir. 2005). Matters of witness credibility\n\nand demeanor are peculiarly for the factfinder.             See Laurent v.\n\nAshcroft, 359 F.3d 59, 64 (1st Cir. 2004) (“Where . . . the\n\njudicial officer who saw and heard the witness makes an adverse\n\ncredibility determination and supports that determination with\n\nspecific   findings,    an     appellate   court     should     treat   that\n\ndetermination with great respect.”).\n\n           Rodriguez   first    contends   that    the   IJ's   decision   is\n\nimproperly based solely on the fact that Sepulveda recanted her\n\nsworn statement.   We disagree.     Substantial evidence supports the\n\nIJ’s findings.   First, the IJ properly could assign some weight to\n\nthe plausibility, vel non, of the Sepulveda in-court testimony as\n\nevidence of her fraudulent intent. See United States v. Lopez, 944\n\nF.2d 33, 40 (1st Cir. 1991) (noting that assessment of an in-court\n\nrecantation is the province of the factfinder).           Furthermore, the\n\nIJ expressly determined that the 2001 statement made by Sepulveda\n\n– that Rodriguez paid her $1500 to marry him and that they never\n\ncohabitated or had marital relations – was not coerced, hence\n\nconstituted a credible account of her marriage to Rodriguez.            This\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fcredibility finding is supported by substantial record evidence.\n\nThe INS agents had verbally informed Sepulveda of her rights prior\n\nto the 2001 interview, after which she signed a written waiver of\n\nthose rights. One of the interviewing agents testified that he had\n\nnot coerced Sepulveda, and that Sepulveda had acknowledged during\n\nthe interview that the INS agents had not made any promises or\n\nthreats.    Sepulveda admits to volunteering the $1500 payoff figure\n\n(viz., the precise amount on deposit in the joint bank account she\n\nopened with Rodriguez on the very day she filed her affidavit in\n\nsupport of his petition to become a permanent lawful resident).\n\nSee Cho v. Gonzales, 404 F.3d 96, 103 (1st Cir. 2005) (noting that\n\nreceipt    of   payment    may   serve   as   evidence   that   marriage     was\n\nfraudulent).      Her     self-incriminating     statements     that   she   had\n\nentered into a fraudulent marriage were obviously against her penal\n\ninterests.\n\n            At the hearing before the IJ, Sepulveda also was unable\n\nto recall important details of her putative married life, such as\n\nthe address of her joint habitation with Rodriguez, the names of\n\nRodriguez' parents, or how long she had dated Rodriquez before they\n\nmarried, see Syed v. Ashcroft, 389 F.3d 248, 252 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(noting that witness’s vagueness and contradiction in details may\n\nevidence that marriage was fraudulent), which tends to corroborate\n\nher sworn 2001 statement that she never lived with nor had marital\n\nrelations with Rodriguez.         Given the sketchiness of Sepulveda’s\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fmemory, the IJ also was not compelled to credit the testimony of\n\nher mother, who purported to supply details concerning the bona\n\nfides       of   the    marital    arrangement,     but   whose    bias   toward   her\n\ndaughter         gave   the   IJ   a   reasonable    basis   for    questioning    the\n\nveracity of her account.               Further, even if the IJ fully credited\n\nthe mother’s testimony that INS agents repeatedly had started and\n\nstopped the tape recorder during her daughter’s interview, the IJ\n\nwas not compelled to accept the mother’s additional inference that\n\nthe INS agents must have “selectively” recorded the interview to\n\nleave out evidence of their coercive tactics.1                        For all these\n\nreasons, we conclude find that the IJ’s finding that the marriage\n\nwas fraudulent is supported by substantial evidence and must be\n\naffirmed.\n\n                 Finally,     Rodriguez     argues    that    the    IJ   improperly\n\ndiscounted other evidence which conclusively demonstrated the bona\n\nfides of the putative marriage, such as his love letters to\n\nSepulveda, life insurance policies naming her as his beneficiary,\n\nand their joint tax returns.               The IJ was not compelled to credit\n\nthis evidence, however, especially in the face of the above-\n\ndescribed evidence suggesting that the marriage was fraudulent.\n\nThe IJ reasonably could conclude that the documentary evidence,\n\n\n\n        1\n      Sepulveda’s mother could not testify that the INS agents had\nmade any promises or threats during the 2001 interview; she\nconceded that she had spent the entire interview in her bedroom\nwatching television and did not hear any of it.\n\n                                           -6-\n\fsuch   as   the    love       letters,   insurance         policy   and    tax   returns,\n\nconstitutes       deliberate      contrivances        to    conceal    the   fraudulent\n\nnature of the Rodriguez marriage for the exclusive purpose of\n\nevading the immigration laws.\n\n            Accordingly,          as   we    cannot      conclude   that     the   record\n\nevidence    compels       a    finding      that   the     Rodriguez      “marriage”   to\n\nSepulveda was bona fide, the BIA decision must be affirmed.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                             -7-\n\f",

Rodriguez petitions for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodriguez contends that the IJ erred, in that the rejection of the Sepulveda in-court recantation cannot suffice, standing alone, to establish that the marriage was fraudulent, and also because the record contained other undisputed evidence (<i>e.g.,</i> love letters) demonstrating that the marriage was valid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the IJ's finding &#8212; that the Rodriguez marriage to Sepulveda was fraudulent &#8212; in order to determine whether it is supported by \"substantial evidence,\" and we will uphold it unless the record would compel a contrary finding. <i>See Ang v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201939\"><a href=\"/opinion/201939/ang-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 54-55 (1st Cir. 2005). Matters of witness credibility and demeanor are peculiarly for the factfinder. <i>See Laurent v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200882\"><a href=\"/opinion/200882/laurent-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">359</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span>, 64 (1st Cir. 2004) (\"Where . . . the judicial officer who saw and heard the witness makes an adverse credibility determination and supports that determination with specific findings, an appellate court should treat that determination with great respect.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodriguez first contends that the IJ's decision is improperly based solely on the fact that Sepulveda recanted her sworn statement. We disagree. Substantial evidence supports the IJ's findings. First, the IJ properly could assign some weight to the plausibility, <i>vel non,</i> of the Sepulveda in-court testimony as evidence of her fraudulent intent. <i>See United States v. Lopez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"567922\"><a href=\"/opinion/567922/united-states-v-christian-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">944</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span>, 40 (1st Cir. 1991) (noting that assessment of an in-court recantation is the province of the factfinder). Furthermore, the IJ expressly determined that the 2001 statement made by Sepulveda &#8212; that Rodriguez paid her $1500 to marry him and that they never cohabitated or had marital relations &#8212; was not coerced, hence constituted a credible account of her marriage to Rodriguez. This credibility finding is supported by substantial record evidence. The INS agents had verbally informed Sepulveda of her rights prior to the 2001 interview, after which she signed a written waiver of those rights. One of the interviewing agents testified that he had not coerced Sepulveda, and that Sepulveda had acknowledged during the interview that the INS agents had not made any promises or threats. Sepulveda admits to volunteering the $1500 payoff figure (<i>viz.,</i> the precise amount on deposit in the joint bank account she opened with Rodriguez on the very day she filed her affidavit in support of his petition to become a permanent lawful resident). <i>See Cho v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></span>, 103 (1st Cir. 2005) (noting that receipt of payment may serve as evidence that marriage was fraudulent). Her self-incriminating statements that she had entered into a fraudulent marriage were obviously against her penal interests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the hearing before the IJ, Sepulveda also was unable to recall important details of her putative married life, such as the address of her joint habitation with Rodriguez, the names of Rodriguez' parents, or how long she had dated Rodriguez before they married, <i>see Syed v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201346\"><a href=\"/opinion/201346/syed-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">248</span></a></span>, 252 (1st Cir. 2004) (noting that witness's vagueness and contradiction in details may evidence that marriage was fraudulent), which tends to corroborate her sworn 2001 statement that she never lived with nor had marital relations with Rodriguez. Given the sketchiness of Sepulveda's memory, the IJ also was not compelled to credit the testimony of her mother, who purported to supply details concerning the bona fides of the marital arrangement, but whose bias toward her daughter gave the IJ a reasonable basis for questioning the veracity of her account. Further, even if the IJ fully credited the mother's testimony that INS agents repeatedly had started and stopped the tape recorder during her daughter's interview, the IJ was not compelled to accept the mother's additional inference that the INS agents must have \"selectively\" recorded the interview to leave out evidence of their coercive tactics.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> For all these reasons, we conclude find that the IJ's finding that the marriage was fraudulent is supported by substantial evidence and must be affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Rodriguez argues that the IJ improperly discounted other evidence which conclusively demonstrated the bona fides of the putative marriage, such as his love letters to Sepulveda, life insurance policies naming her as his beneficiary, and their joint tax returns. The IJ was not compelled to credit this evidence, however, especially in the face of the above-described evidence suggesting that the marriage was fraudulent. The IJ reasonably could conclude that the documentary evidence, such as the love letters, insurance policy and tax returns, constitutes deliberate contrivances to conceal the fraudulent nature of the Rodriguez marriage for the exclusive purpose of evading the immigration laws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, as we cannot conclude that the record evidence compels a finding that the Rodriguez \"marriage\" to Sepulveda was bona fide, the BIA decision must be affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Sepulveda's mother could not testify that the INS agents had made any promises or threats during the 2001 interview; she conceded that she had spent the entire interview in her bedroom watching television and did not hear any of it</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
