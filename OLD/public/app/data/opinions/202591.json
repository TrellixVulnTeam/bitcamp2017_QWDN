Clements, with whom Ingrid S. Martin and Clements &\nClements, LLP, were on brief, for appellant.\n     Cynthia A. Young, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief, for the\nUnited States.\n\n\n\n                           January 11, 2007\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation\n\f     SILER, Senior Circuit Judge.         Defendant Tavon Robinson was\n\nconvicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to\n\ndistribute cocaine, 21 U.S.C. § 846; possession with intent to\n\ndistribute and distribution of cocaine, 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1);\n\nbeing a felon in possession of a firearm, 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1);\n\nand possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking\n\noffense, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A).\n\n     Robinson appeals both firearms convictions and his sentence,\n\nalleging   prosecutorial    misconduct,    insufficient   evidence,   and\n\nimproper sentencing.    We AFFIRM.\n\n                                  I.\n\n     In 2004, DEA Special Agent David DiTullio agreed to purchase\n\ntwo ounces of crack cocaine for $2,350 from Adam Ellard as part of\n\nan undercover drug investigation.         Unable to locate any crack\n\ncocaine for the deal, Ellard contacted Willie Hester, whom he had\n\nseen packaging crack on a previous occasion with another man,\n\nNorman Barnes.   Hester agreed to sell Ellard sixty-two grams of\n\ncrack cocaine, but conditioned the sale on his accompanying Ellard\n\nto the deal.\n\n     Hester picked up Ellard in a Honda, followed by a Ford1 with\n\nNew Hampshire plates.      The Ford had three occupants: Robinson in\n\nthe driver’s seat, Stephen Tucker in the front passenger seat, and\n\n\n\n     1\n      The Ford was rented to Cleo Mercer, the sister of Stephen\nTucker.\n\n                                  -2-\n\fBarnes in the back.     The two cars traveled to a parking lot in\n\nDorchester to complete the deal with DiTullio.    Ellard exited the\n\nHonda and entered the passenger side of DiTullio’s vehicle.      He\n\ntold DiTullio that the crack cocaine was in the Ford and requested\n\nthe $2,350.    DiTullio showed Ellard the money, let him count it,\n\nbut would not give it to him unless he produced the crack cocaine.\n\nEllard returned to the Honda to consult with Hester, who told him\n\nto go speak with Barnes in the Ford.      Barnes informed Ellard he\n\nwould not produce the drugs without any money.     In an attempt to\n\ncompromise, Ellard had DiTullio back his vehicle up to the rear of\n\nthe Ford.    DiTullio again refused to give Ellard the money without\n\nthe drugs.\n\n     Frustrated at the stalled deal, Robinson exited the driver’s\n\nseat of the Ford, walked to the front of the hood for a few\n\nmoments,2 and then proceeded to DiTullio’s vehicle.   Speaking with\n\nDiTullio through the passenger window, Robinson removed a clear\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      Conflicting testimony was presented at trial regarding\nRobinson’s conduct in exiting the car and moving to the front of\nthe hood. Ellard testified that Robinson unlatched the hood from\ninside, reached between the hood and the grill stating, “I’m\nlooking for something,” but closed the hood without removing\nanything.   DEA Group Supervisor Richard Guerard, who conducted\nsurveillance of the transaction, testified that Robinson opened the\nhood “about five or six inches” and then closed it.        DiTullio\ntestified that Robinson opened the hood approximately one-quarter\nof the way, removed an item and put it in his jacket pocket. Agent\nSteven Story, who also conducted surveillance, testified that\nRobinson opened the hood approximately eighteen inches, but shut it\nwithout removing anything.\n\n                                 -3-\n\fplastic bag3 from his jacket pocket and placed it on the front\n\npassenger seat.    DiTullio gave Robinson the money, and Robinson\n\nbegan walking back to the Ford.     As law enforcement officers moved\n\nin for an arrest, Robinson fled briefly before being apprehended.\n\nHe was arrested and police found $2,350 and a clear plastic bag\n\ncontaining marijuana and crack cocaine in his possession.\n\n     After seizure of the Ford, an inspection at a garage revealed\n\ntwo loaded semiautomatic pistols wrapped in a T-shirt and hidden\n\ninside a small space in front of the engine compartment near the\n\nfront of the hood.4\n\n     The next day, Officer Conners overheard Robinson and Barnes\n\nconversing in their shared holding cell.              According to Officer\n\nConners, Robinson remarked to Barnes, “It’s not crack anyway. It’s\n\nonly coke. They’ll find that out when they do the lab tests.”\n\nOfficer Conners also heard Robinson tell Barnes that “When they\n\ncame from everywhere, I could have gone boom, boom.”\n\n     At   trial,   in   his   opening    statement,    Robinson’s   counsel\n\nadmitted his client’s guilt on the drug charges,5 but argued that\n\n\n\n     3\n      The parties stipulated at trial that the clear plastic bag\ncontained 28.2 grams of crack cocaine.\n     4\n      Agent Story testified that Robinson would have access to the\nspace where the pistols were hidden with the hood partially open.\nGloucester Police Officer Sean Conners also testified that the\nspace was accessible if the hood was only open three to six inches.\n     5\n      Robinson pled guilty to the drug charges on the morning of\nthe third day of the trial.\n\n                                   -4-\n\fhe was unaware of the firearms’ presence.    Robinson was convicted\n\non both firearms charges.     The district court denied Robinson’s\n\nmotion for judgment of acquittal and sentenced him to 137 months.6\n\n                                 II.\n\n     Claims for prosecutorial misconduct are reviewed under the\n\nharmless error standard if the defendant contemporaneously objected\n\nto challenged statements.     United States v. Auch, 187 F.3d 125,\n\n128-29 (1st Cir. 1999).     If no objections were made, challenged\n\nstatements are reviewed for plain error. United States v. Sanchez-\n\nBerrios, 424 F.3d 65, 73 (1st Cir. 2005).          We review de novo\n\nwhether a challenged statement by the prosecutor during closing\n\nargument was improper.    Whether the misconduct, if any, warrants a\n\nnew trial is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.    United States v.\n\nNelson-Rodriguez, 319, F.3d 12, 38 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n     We review claims of insufficient evidence de novo.       United\n\nStates v. Hall, 434 F.3d 42, 49 (1st Cir. 2006).    A conviction will\n\nbe affirmed “if, after assaying all the evidence in the light most\n\namiable to the government, and taking all reasonable inferences in\n\nits favor, a rational factfinder could find, beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt, that the prosecution successfully proved the essential\n\nelements of the crime.”   United States v. Perez-Gonzalez, 445 F.3d\n\n\n\n     6\n      Robinson was sentenced to 77 months concurrently for the drug\ncharges and being a felon in possession of a firearm. He was also\nsentenced to 60 months for possessing a firearm in furtherance of\na drug trafficking offense.\n\n                                 -5-\n\f39, 48 (1st Cir. 2006).      We also review de novo claims that the\n\ndistrict court committed errors of law at sentencing.                         United\n\nStates v. Pho, 433 F.3d 53, 60 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n                                    III.\n\n     Robinson   raises    three     issues         on     appeal:    prosecutorial\n\nmisconduct, insufficient evidence, and improper sentencing.                       We\n\naddress each issue in turn.\n\n                                        A.\n\n     Robinson’s first argument is that the prosecution repeatedly\n\nengaged in a pattern of misconduct during both cross-examination\n\nand closing argument when it systematically portrayed him as a\n\nhabitual drug user and career drug dealer.                 He contends that the\n\ngovernment’s questions about the drug deal with DiTullio and\n\nrepeated questions and references to his prior history of drug\n\ntrafficking constitute reversible error because they confused the\n\njury into convicting him on the gun charges based mostly on his\n\nprior history of drug trafficking.\n\n     Robinson   argues    that    the    government         improperly      elicited\n\nprejudicial   testimony   regarding          the   drug    deal     with   DiTullio.\n\nAccording to Robinson, such testimony was unnecessary because he\n\nnever challenged his guilt: defense counsel informed the government\n\nprior to trial that he would not deny his role in the drug deal\n\nwith DiTullio, defense counsel’s opening statement conceded his\n\nguilt to the drug trafficking charges, at no time during the trial\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fdid he otherwise contest his guilt, and on the morning of the third\n\nday he entered guilty pleas to both drug charges.            Thus, he argues,\n\nthe government was relieved of its burden to prove that Robinson\n\nengaged in drug trafficking as part of its charge that he possessed\n\na firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense.               Robinson\n\ncontends that the sole reason the government focused on this drug\n\ndeal was to make the jury believe it was to convict him for his\n\ndrug trafficking activities and not the firearms charges.\n\n      This argument is unavailing for several reasons.                     First,\n\nalthough he conceded his role in the drug deal with DiTullio prior\n\nto trial and during his opening statement, Robinson remained free\n\nto change his mind whether he would contest both drug trafficking\n\ncharges at some point in the trial.            He did not formally enter\n\nguilty pleas to both charges until the morning of the third day of\n\ntrial, and until that time the government still had the burden to\n\nprove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.               Therefore, it was\n\nproper   to    present   evidence    that     Robinson   engaged      in    drug\n\ntrafficking.\n\n      Robinson claims the government also engaged in misconduct when\n\nit   repeatedly   questioned   him    about    his   prior    drug    use     and\n\ninvolvement in drug trafficking during his cross-examination and\n\nwhen it returned to this theme in closing arguments.                 He argues\n\nthat these questions and closing statements constitute misconduct\n\nand violate FED . R. EVID . 404(b).\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f       On several occasions during Robinson’s cross-examination, the\n\ngovernment attempted to question him about his history in dealing\n\nand using drugs.7         At a sidebar after repeated defense objections,\n\nthe government told the district court that it was not inquiring\n\nabout prior bad acts, but rather showing that Robinson knew about\n\nthe dangers of dealing drugs in order to prove the “in furtherance”\n\nelement        of    possessing    a   firearm     in     furtherance     of   a   drug\n\ntrafficking          offense.     Several     times      after   the    sidebar,    the\n\ngovernment again attempted to ask Robinson about his drug dealing\n\nhistory in an effort to prove why he would bring a gun to a drug\n\ndeal and how he knew prices of drugs.\n\n            Evidence of “a defendant’s other bad acts [is proper] only if\n\nthat evidence meets the requirements of both Rule 404(b) and Rule\n\n403.”        United States v. Tse, 375 F.3d 148, 155 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nRule 404(b) evidence must be “specially relevant” and cannot\n\n“include bad character or propensity as a necessary link in the\n\ninferential chain.”           United States v. Flemmi, 434 F.3d 7, 12 (1st\n\nCir.        2005).     Even   assuming      that   the    district     court   properly\n\nexcluded the government’s questions to Robinson about his prior\n\nhistory, Robinson cannot show prejudice from these questions.8\n\n\n        7\n            Robinson objected to some questions along this line, but not\nall.\n        8\n      Because of Robinson’s inconsistent objections to this line of\nquestioning, the plain error and harmless error standards apply to\ndifferent questions. However, as discussed infra, Robinson cannot\nmake a showing of prejudice under the lesser harmless error\n\n                                            -8-\n\f       Robinson claims that the mere asking of these questions was\n\nprejudicial.    See United States v. Meserve, 271 F.3d 314, 326 (1st\n\nCir. 2001) (“[T]he question itself may nevertheless prejudice a\n\ndefendant because of the weight a jury gives to the questions asked\n\nby a prosecutor.”).        However, Robinson never answered many of the\n\nquestions because the court sustained his objections.                   Thus, the\n\nrequired showing of prejudice becomes more difficult.                      See id.\n\n(noting that where challenged questions are left unanswered, the\n\nharmless    error   analysis    is    likely    to   weigh    in   favor   of   the\n\nappellee); see also United States v. Inamorati, 996 F.2d 456, 485\n\n(1st   Cir.   1993)    (prejudicial     effect       of   challenged    questions\n\nlessened when questions were not answered).\n\n       In response to a question asked without objection, Robinson\n\nadmitted that it was not out of the ordinary for him to be selling\n\ndrugs.     Moreover, on the third day of the trial, Robinson pled\n\nguilty to the two drug charges.         At this point, the jury had heard\n\nconsiderable evidence regarding Robinson’s drug deal with DiTullio.\n\nTherefore, it is difficult to see how the questions prejudiced\n\nRobinson.\n\n       Robinson cites to two main cases to support his contention\n\nthat     reversal     is   required.           However,      these     cases    are\n\ndistinguishable.       First, he cites United States v. Crawford, 438\n\nF.2d 441 (8th Cir. 1971).            In that case, the prosecution asked\n\n\nstandard.\n\n                                       -9-\n\fquestions insinuating that the defendant was a member of a group of\n\nnarcotics users and sellers.       The court found reversible error, in\n\npart, because the only purpose in asking those questions was to\n\n“degrade the defendant and to prejudice the jury against him.” Id.\n\nat 444-45.    Here, the government did have a legitimate purpose in\n\nasking the questions: to provide the jury with a reason why\n\nRobinson would bring a firearm to a drug deal.                The misconduct\n\ninherent in the baseless attacks in Crawford is not present here.\n\n      Robinson similarly cites to United States v. Newman, 49 F.3d\n\n1   (1st   Cir.   1995).     In   that   case,   we   found   error   in   the\n\ngovernment’s questions of whether the defendant knew what a “con\n\nman” or “confidence game” was.           As was the case in Crawford, we\n\nfound the government had “no justifiable purpose for that line of\n\nquestioning, other than, as [the defendant] suggests, to discredit\n\nhim by insinuation.”       Id. at 8.     Again, the same is not true here\n\nbecause the government did have a legitimate reason for pursuing\n\nits line of questioning.\n\n      Robinson next claims the prosecution committed reversible\n\nerror when it asked him on cross-examination whether two law\n\nenforcement witnesses lied on the witness stand.          Agent Genese had\n\ntestified that when he asked Robinson whether he knew the cocaine\n\nhe sold to DiTullio was real or fake, Robinson responded that he\n\ndid not know.       During Robinson’s cross-examination, he denied\n\n\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fsaying that he was unsure what he sold.      The prosecution then asked\n\nhim if Agent Genese was lying.9\n\n     At another point, Officer Conners testified that he heard\n\nRobinson state that when the officers surrounded him just prior to\n\nhis arrest, he could have gone “boom, boom.”          During Robinson’s\n\ncross-examination, he denied making the statement and responded\n\nthat Officer Conners could have been mistaken. The government then\n\nasked Robinson if Conners was lying, to which he answered that he\n\ndid not know and was unable to say.10\n\n     “This Court has held it is improper for an attorney to ask a\n\nwitness whether another witness lied on the stand.”       United States\n\nv. Thiongo, 344 F.3d 55, 61 (1st Cir. 2003) (citing United States\n\nv. Gaines, 170 F.3d 72, 81 (1st Cir. 1999)) (noting that such\n\npractice is improper because credibility judgments are for the\n\njury).     Furthermore, “[g]iven the faith that the jury may place in\n\nthe word of a law enforcement officer, it is unfair to force a\n\ncriminal defendant to choose between recanting and calling a law\n\nofficer a liar.”     United States v. Fernandez, 145 F.3d 59, 64 (1st\n\nCir. 1998).\n\n     Because Robinson objected to the government’s question asking\n\nwhether Agent Genese was lying, it is reviewed for harmless error.\n\n\n\n     9\n      Robinson     objected   to   this   question,   which   the   court\nsustained.\n     10\n          Robinson did not object to this question.\n\n                                   -11-\n\fSee United States v. Sullivan, 85 F.3d 743, 750 (1st Cir. 1996)\n\n(analyzing a similar question under the harmless error standard).\n\nWhile the question was improper, any resulting error was harmless\n\nbecause the district court sustained Robinson’s objection and\n\nrelieved him from answering.     Robinson was not forced “to choose\n\nbetween recanting and calling a law officer a liar.”      Fernandez,\n\n145 F.3d at 64.    The only benefit the government gained from the\n\nquestion was highlighting the discrepancy between the testimony of\n\nAgent Genese and Robinson.     As was the case in Sullivan, “[t]hat\n\nthere was a contradiction between [Robinson’s] testimony and [Agent\n\nGenese’s] was obvious. Pointing out the obvious most likely scored\n\nthe government, at most, rhetorical points.”     Sullivan, 85 F.3d at\n\n750.\n\n       Robinson did not object when the government asked him if\n\nOfficer Connors was lying.   Therefore, we review this question for\n\nplain error.11    See Fernandez, 145 F.3d at 64.    “[T]o constitute\n\nplain error [the questions] must have affected the outcome of the\n\ndistrict court proceedings.”    Id.   The prosecution’s question here\n\n\n\n\n       11\n      The government’s question to Robinson whether Officer Conners\nwas “mistaken” was proper. See Gaines, 170 F.3d at 81-82 (citing\nUnited States v. Gaind, 31 F.3d 73, 77 (2d Cir. 1994) (“Asking a\nwitness whether a previous witness who gave conflicting testimony\nis ‘mistaken’ highlights the objective conflict without requiring\nthe witness to condemn the prior witness as a purveyor of\ndeliberate falsehood, i.e., a ‘liar.’”)).\n\n                                 -12-\n\fwas not plain error because Robinson fails to show prejudice.12\n\nSimilar to the question about Agent Genese’s testimony, this\n\nquestion merely drew the jury’s attention to the discrepancy\n\nbetween Robinson’s and Officer Conner’s testimony.                  Thus, it is\n\ndifficult    to    imagine    that     “the    improper   framing     of    these\n\nunobjected-to     questions    affected       the   outcome   of    the    trial.”\n\nFernandez, 145 F.3d at 65.\n\n     Robinson     also   argues      that     the   government     continued   to\n\nimpermissibly vouch for the law enforcement officers in its closing\n\nargument.    In relevant part, the prosecutor argued:\n\n     Ladies and gentleman, if you believe that the officers of\n     the United States, if you believe that these agents got\n     on that stand with all those years of experience and in\n     the face of their oath stood up there and lied in their\n     testimony and you believe they did that, then acquit the\n     defendant. Then acquit the defendant.\n\n     Because there was no contemporaneous objection, we review for\n\nplain error.      United States v. Wilkerson, 411 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).    Improper vouching occurs when the government “place[s] the\n\nprestige of the United States behind a witness by making personal\n\nassurances about the credibility of a witness,” United States v.\n\nRosario-Diaz, 202 F.3d 54, 65 (1st Cir. 2000), or implies “that the\n\njury should credit the government’s evidence simply because the\n\ngovernment can be trusted.”          United States v. Perez-Ruiz, 353 F.3d\n\n\n\n     12\n      In fact, Robinson’s brief seemingly concedes no inherent\nprejudice in this particular question. (“While these questions in\nisolation may not have been reversible error . . . .”).\n\n                                       -13-\n\f1, 9 (1st Cir. 2003).       The government’s statement in this case did\n\nneither and does not constitute plain error.\n\n     The government’s statement merely invited the jurors to acquit\n\nRobinson if they believed that Agent Genese and Officer Conners\n\nwere lying.       This is not the type of improper vouching present in\n\nRosario-Diaz or Perez-Ruiz because the government neither made\n\nstatements about the witnesses’ credibility nor implied that they\n\ncould be trusted based on their affiliation with the United States.\n\nMoreover, these statements do not rise to the level of plain error.\n\nSee Wilkerson, 411 F.3d at 8 (no plain error where prosecutor’s\n\nrebuttal included statement that officers “didn’t stretch the truth\n\nhere”); Sullivan, 85 F.3d at 751 (no plain error where government’s\n\nclosing    argument     stated     that   one    witness   “came     off   pretty\n\nbelievable,” another “couldn’t have lied about anything,” and that\n\nall of them “were telling the truth”).\n\n     In addition to arguing that the government improperly vouched\n\nfor law enforcement witnesses in its closing argument, Robinson\n\nalleges other instances of prejudice in the government’s summation.\n\nBecause he failed to object to the government’s closing argument,\n\nwe review for plain error.         Sullivan, 85 F.3d at 751.         We “will not\n\nnotice    error    unless   it   caused   ‘a    miscarriage     of   justice’   or\n\nseriously    undermined     ‘the    integrity     or   public    reputation     of\n\njudicial proceedings.’”          United States v. Joselyn, 99 F.3d 1182,\n\n1198 (1st Cir. 1996); see also United States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\f967, 977 (1st Cir. 1995) (referring to this standard as “hard-to-\n\nsatisfy”).\n\n       Robinson claims that the government’s first statement in its\n\nclosing argument directed the jury to convict him based on his\n\nalleged     life   of     crime     rather      than    his   alleged   possession   of\n\nfirearms.13\n\n       While “arguments urging a jury to act in any capacity other\n\nthan as the impartial arbiter of the facts in the case before it\n\nare improper,” United States v. Manning, 23 F.3d 570, 574 (1st Cir.\n\n1994), the government’s closing argument in this case did not\n\nrequest     the    jury      to    act    in    that    manner.   “In   assaying     the\n\nappropriateness         of   a    prosecutor’s         remarks,   context   frequently\n\ndetermines meaning.”              United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d. 1161,\n\n1187    (1st   Cir.     1993).           Here,    the    discussion     following    the\n\nchallenged statement focused on the facts attendant to Robinson’s\n\narrest, not to his prior drug dealing.                    The government then spoke\n\nfor some time about the fundamentals of the law of the case before\n\nit mentioned Robinson and his alleged life of crime.                     Even when the\n\ngovernment did mention his prior history, it constituted only a\n\nsmall portion of the entire summation.                        Taken in context, the\n\nprosecutor’s remarks are not plain error.\n\n\n\n       13\n      The government’s closing argument began: “There comes a time\nin every man and woman’s life that they must be held accountable\nfor their actions. That time for this defendant, Tavon Robinson,\nis here and now.”\n\n                                               -15-\n\f       Robinson next alleges that the government’s closing argument\n\nimpermissibly returned to his history as a drug dealer. Robinson’s\n\nbrief    selectively        excerpts       sentences         from    the     government’s\n\nsummation and dissects each sentence to arrive at his conclusion\n\nthat the closing was plain error.                      However, we must view the\n\ncontext of the remarks in determining whether error exists.                             Id.\n\nViewed   accordingly,           these    remarks      are    not    plain    error.     The\n\ngovernment’s        closing          argument    focused       on     the     uncertainty\n\nsurrounding        the    drug   deal    and    the    notion      that     drug   dealers,\n\nincluding Robinson, bring guns to drug deals to protect themselves.\n\nThe government merely repeated what Robinson admitted to, without\n\nobjection, on cross-examination: that he knew the “ways of the\n\nworld” and about drug deals in general.\n\n       The closest the government came to impermissibly prejudicing\n\nthe    jury   in    its    closing      argument      was    when    it     concluded   its\n\nrebuttal:\n\n       I would suggest to you, ladies and gentlemen . . . that\n       [Robinson is] guilty of possessing those guns in\n       furtherance of that drug deal in which anything could\n       have happened and probably something would have happened\n       had it been a real drug dealer and not a DEA undercover\n       agent who was getting ripped off by the defendant.\n\n       While it is improper to “needlessly arouse the emotions of the\n\njury,” United States v. Pirovolous, 844 F.2d 415, 425 (7th Cir.\n\n1988), by resorting to unsupported hypotheticals, the error here\n\ndoes    not   result       in    a    “miscarriage      of    justice.”        The    court\n\ninstructed the jury that same afternoon that closing arguments were\n\n                                           -16-\n\fnot to be considered as evidence.       Therefore, the hypothetical was\n\nnot plain error.      See United States v. Procopio, 88 F.3d 21 (1st\n\nCir. 1996) (no plain error, in light of a curative instruction,\n\ndespite    only    circumstantial   evidence   of   guilt   and   “seriously\n\ncareless” comment by prosecutor).\n\n     Robinson argues that even if any of the alleged prosecutorial\n\nerrors do not, by themselves, require reversal, the totality of the\n\ngovernment’s misconduct compels the conclusion that Robinson was\n\ndenied a fair trial.       We do not accept Robinson’s premise that\n\nevery evidentiary error in a criminal trial amounts to government\n\nmisconduct.       Nevertheless, for ease, we will use the misconduct\n\ntest to address his arguments.\n\n     We weigh several factors in determining “whether prosecutorial\n\nmisconduct has so poisoned the well that a new trial is required:\n\n(1) the severity of the misconduct; (2) the context in which it\n\noccurred; (3) whether the judge gave any curative instructions and\n\nthe likely effect of such instructions; and (4) the strength of the\n\nevidence against the defendant.”       United States v. Casas, 425 F.3d\n\n23, 38 (1st Cir. 2005), cert. denied, 126 S. Ct. 1670 (2006).           This\n\nanalysis focuses on the underlying fairness of the trial. Meserve,\n\n271 F.3d at 332.       In this case, the government’s actions do not\n\nrequire reversal.\n\n     First, the government’s conduct was not as severe as Robinson\n\nalleges.      While some of the prosecutor’s questions regarding\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fRobinson’s history of drug dealing may have been improper, their\n\nsole purpose, unlike in Newman, was not to paint Robinson as an\n\nevil character, but to show his motivation for carrying a firearm\n\nto a drug deal.              The government also appealed to the jury’s\n\nemotions      in    closing,     perhaps       needlessly,         but    considering       the\n\ncontext of the entire closing argument and rebuttal, the statements\n\nwere not highly prejudicial.\n\n       Second, we should look at the time when the alleged misconduct\n\noccurred.      The government properly elicited testimony about the\n\ndrug   deal    with        DiTullio    because       at    the    time     it    asked   those\n\nquestions, Robinson had not yet formally pled guilty to those\n\ncharges.           Once    Robinson     entered       a    formal       guilty    plea,     the\n\ngovernment      shifted       its     focus    from       the    drug    deal    to   the   gun\n\npossession. Therefore, the government did not cause the jury to be\n\nunnecessarily focused on the drug charges and the questions did not\n\nheighten prejudice or create confusion as Robinson suggests.\n\n       Third, while the district court gave no curative instructions,\n\nRobinson requested none.                The district court did give general\n\ninstructions before deliberations regarding what the jury could and\n\ncould not consider as evidence, including questions with sustained\n\nobjections, opening statements, and closing arguments.\n\n       Finally,           evidence     of     Robinson’s           guilt        was   neither\n\nexceptionally        weak     nor     exceptionally         strong.        The    government\n\nintroduced sufficient evidence to convict Robinson on the firearms\n\n\n                                              -18-\n\fcharges, but this evidence did require a finding of constructive\n\npossession.\n\n     Taking these factors together, Robinson was not sufficiently\n\nprejudiced to entitle him to a new trial.             The underlying fairness\n\nof the trial was not compromised because, although there may have\n\nbeen error, it was not sufficiently linked to the outcome so as to\n\nrequire a new trial.\n\n                                     B.\n\n     Robinson next argues that the government failed to produce\n\nsufficient evidence at trial to prove that he knowingly possessed\n\na firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime.              He contends\n\nthat the evidence indicates that he had no role in hiding the guns\n\nor was even aware of their existence.\n\n     In order to prove possession of a firearm, the government must\n\nshow actual possession or constructive possession.                Constructive\n\npossession “exists when a person knowingly has the power and\n\nintention at a given time to exercise dominion or control over the\n\narea where the contraband is found.”        United States v. McLean, 409\n\nF.3d 492, 501 (1st Cir. 2005) (internal quotations marks and\n\ncitations omitted).     “[T]he requisite knowledge and intention may\n\nbe inferred from circumstances . . . . [b]ut knowledge must be\n\nfairly inferable from the circumstances.”                  Id. (citing United\n\nStates   v.   Zavala   Maldonado,   23    F.3d   4,    7   (1st   Cir.   1994)).\n\n“Constructive possession of a firearm may be established by showing\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\fthat the person knows (or has reason to know) that the firearm is\n\nwithin easy reach, so that he can take actual possession of it\n\nvirtually at will.”    United States v. Lamare, 711 F.2d 3, 5-6 (1st\n\nCir. 1983).\n\n     The evidence was sufficient to permit a rational jury to\n\nconclude that Robinson constructively possessed the firearms found\n\nin the engine compartment.    First, even though the evidence showed\n\nthat Robinson neither rented the Ford in which the firearms were\n\nfound, nor owned the firearms,14 constructive possession does not\n\nrequire ownership of either the guns or the area in which they are\n\nlocated.     All that is necessary is that the defendant knowingly\n\nhave the ability and intent to exercise dominion and control of the\n\nfirearm or area where it       is located.       See United States v.\n\nCarpenter, 403 F.3d 9, 10 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n     A rational jury could have concluded that Robinson had the\n\nability and intent to exercise dominion and control of the firearms\n\nfor several reasons.    Even though the Ford was rented to Mercer,\n\nRobinson’s    relationship   with    Tucker   provided   him   with   ample\n\nopportunity to store the guns in the engine compartment.         Evidence\n\nwas presented that Robinson and Tucker were friends, that Mercer\n\nleft the keys to the Ford in various locations around the house\n\nwhere Tucker and Robinson would have easy access to them, and that\n\n\n\n     14\n      Evidence showed that Tucker purchased one of the pistols from\nDaniel Clagon.\n\n                                    -20-\n\fRobinson was part of a group who was to drive the Ford to New\n\nJersey for a trip.\n\n     Second, a rational jury could have interpreted Robinson’s\n\nstatement to Barnes in the holding cell that “When they came from\n\neverywhere, I could have gone boom, boom,” to mean that Robinson\n\ncould have shot the agents using the firearms found in the Ford.\n\n     Robinson contends that even if the evidence was sufficient to\n\nprove that he knowingly possessed firearms, there was insufficient\n\nevidence to prove that he possessed the firearms in furtherance of\n\na drug trafficking offense.\n\n     Under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c), the government must prove that the\n\nfirearm was possessed “to advance or promote the commission of the\n\nunderlying offense.   The mere presence of a firearm in an area\n\nwhere a criminal act occurs is not a sufficient basis for imposing\n\n[the] mandatory sentence [under §924(c)].” United States v. Grace,\n\n367 F.3d 29, 35 (1st Cir. 2004).      There must be some sufficient\n\nnexus between the firearm and the drug trafficking offense.    While\n\na sufficient nexus is more readily found in cases where the firearm\n\nis in plain view and accessible to the defendant during a drug\n\ntrafficking offense, see United States v. Felton, 417 F.3d 97, 106\n\n(1st Cir. 2005); United States v. Garner, 338 F.3d 78, 91 (1st Cir.\n\n2003), we have found a sufficient nexus to exist where the drugs\n\nand firearms were not jointly located and easily accessible.    See\n\nUnited States v. Carlos Cruz, 352 F.3d 499, 509 (1st Cir. 2003)\n\n\n                               -21-\n\f(rifles located inside a nearby trash can and covered with blankets\n\nwhile drugs were located on defendant’s person).              In these cases,\n\nwe weigh several factors: whether the firearm was loaded, whether\n\nthe firearm was easily accessible, the proximity of the firearm to\n\nthe drugs, and the surrounding circumstances.              Id.\n\n     Here, the jury had ample reason to conclude that Robinson\n\npossessed   the   firearms   in   furtherance      of   the   drug   deal   with\n\nDiTullio.     Both firearms hidden in the Ford were loaded and were\n\naccessible by Robinson during the drug deal with DiTullio.                  All\n\nRobinson had to do to gain actual possession of the firearms was to\n\nopen the Ford’s hood three to six inches and reach inside the\n\nengine compartment.       Moreover, because Robinson had the drugs on\n\nhis person when he was inside the car and subsequently opened the\n\nhood, the firearms were within close proximity to the drugs. Also,\n\na jury could have concluded that Robinson was in charge of the drug\n\ndeal and that the firearms were available if necessary because\n\nRobinson drove the car and took charge when the drug deal appeared\n\nas if it would not happen. Therefore, sufficient evidence existed\n\nfor the jury to find that Robinson possessed the firearms in\n\nfurtherance of a drug trafficking offense.\n\n                                      C.\n\n     Robinson’s final claim is that the district court erred at\n\nsentencing.      He contends that “[t]he district court erroneously\n\nbelieved    it   was   constrained   by     the   United   States    Sentencing\n\n\n                                     -22-\n\fGuidelines (‘Guidelines’) when it sentenced” him to 137 months.\n\nSpecifically, he points to the district court’s comment that “I\n\nthink that -- I don’t have a whole lot of discretion here.                 I --\n\nbut I don’t see any reason to go to the high end of the advisory\n\nguideline range.     I think 137 is the lowest I can do with the [60-\n\n]month consecutively-run sentence,” as evidence that the district\n\ncourt misapprehended its discretion under the Guidelines.\n\n       Since Booker v. United States, 543 U.S. 220 (2005), we have\n\nheld that district courts must continue to consider the Guidelines\n\nsentencing range in calculating reasonable sentences.                     United\n\nStates v. Jimenez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 518 (1st Cir. 2006) (en\n\nbanc). This consideration should include “the guideline range, any\n\nproposed departures, followed by the further determination whether\n\nother   factors   identified   by   either    side      warrant   an    ultimate\n\nsentence above or below the guideline range.”             Id. at 518-19.      If\n\na sentence falls outside the Guidelines range, the district court\n\nmust    provide   justification,    which    may   be    either   express     or\n\ninferred.    Id. at 519.\n\n       Robinson’s claim fails for two reasons.           First, the district\n\ncourt clearly understood Booker’s holding because it explicitly\n\nreferred to the Guidelines range as “advisory” in determining\n\nRobinson’s   sentence.     Second,    the    district     court’s      statement\n\nregarding its apparent lack of discretion does not appear to refer\n\nto its inability to depart downward under the Guidelines because of\n\n\n                                    -23-\n\ftheir mandatory nature.     Rather, that statement reflects the\n\ndistrict court’s conclusion that after considering all relevant\n\nsentencing factors, it could not provide adequate reasoning for\n\nimposing a sentence below the advisory Guidelines range.   In order\n\nto depart downward the district court would have been required to\n\ngive an express or implied reason for doing so, and it felt it\n\ncould not do so based on the evidence presented at sentencing.\n\nDuring Robinson’s sentencing, the district court remarked that it\n\nwas troubled by Robinson’s belief that this case “was no big deal,”\n\nhis inability to stay out of trouble at home, and his apparently\n\nfabricated testimony. Considering these statements in light of the\n\nrecord, see Jimenez-Beltre, 440 F.3d at 519, as well as the\n\ndistrict court’s characterization of the Guidelines as “advisory,”\n\nwe find no error.\n\n                               IV.\n\n     For these reasons, we AFFIRM Robinson’s convictions and\n\nsentence.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -24-\n\f",

Unable to locate any crack cocaine for the deal, Ellard contacted Willie Hester, whom he had seen packaging crack on a previous occasion with another man, Norman Barnes.

The two cars traveled to a parking lot in Dorchester to complete the deal with DiTullio. Ellard exited the Honda and entered the passenger side of DiTullio's vehicle. He told DiTullio that the crack cocaine was in the Ford and requested the $2,350. DiTullio showed Ellard the money, let him count it, but would not give it to him unless he produced the crack cocaine. Ellard returned to the Honda to consult with Hester, who told him to go speak with Barnes in the Ford. Barnes informed Ellard he would not produce the drugs without any money. In an attempt to compromise, Ellard had DiTullio back his vehicle up to the rear of the Ford. DiTullio again refused to give Ellard the money without the drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Frustrated at the stalled deal, Robinson exited the driver's seat of the Ford, walked to the front of the hood for a few moments,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and then proceeded to DiTullio's vehicle. Speaking with DiTullio through the passenger window, Robinson removed a clear plastic bag<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> from his jacket pocket and placed it on the front passenger seat. DiTullio gave Robinson the money, and Robinson began walking back to the Ford. As law enforcement officers moved in for an arrest, Robinson fled briefly before being apprehended. He was arrested and police found $2,350 and a clear plastic bag containing marijuana and crack cocaine in his possession.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After seizure of the Ford, an inspection at a garage revealed two loaded semiautomatic pistols wrapped in a T-shirt and hidden inside a small space in front of the engine compartment near the front of the hood.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day, Officer Conners overheard Robinson and Barnes conversing in their shared holding cell.

Pho,</i> 433 F.3d 53, 60 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robinson raises three issues on appeal: prosecutorial misconduct, insufficient evidence, and improper sentencing. We address each issue in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robinson's first argument is that the prosecution repeatedly engaged in a pattern of misconduct during both cross-examination and closing argument when it systematically portrayed him as a habitual drug user and career drug dealer. He contends that the government's questions about the drug deal with DiTullio and repeated questions and references to his prior history of drug trafficking constitute reversible error because they confused the jury into convicting him on the gun charges based mostly on his prior history of drug trafficking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robinson argues that the government improperly elicited prejudicial testimony regarding the drug deal with DiTullio. According to Robinson, such testimony was unnecessary because he never challenged his guilt: defense counsel informed the government prior to trial that he would not deny his role in the drug deal with DiTullio, defense counsel's opening statement conceded his guilt to the drug trafficking charges, at no time during the trial did he otherwise contest his guilt, and on the morning of the third day he entered guilty pleas to both drug charges. Thus, he argues, the government was relieved of its burden to prove that Robinson engaged in drug trafficking as part of its charge that he possessed a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense. Robinson contends that the sole reason the government focused on this drug deal was to make the jury believe it was to convict him for his drug trafficking activities and not the firearms charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is unavailing for several reasons. First, although he conceded his role in the drug deal with DiTullio prior to trial and during his opening statement, Robinson remained free to change his mind whether he would contest both drug trafficking charges at some point in the trial. He did not formally enter guilty pleas to both charges until the morning of the third day of trial, and until that time the government still had the burden to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, it was proper to present evidence that Robinson engaged in drug trafficking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robinson claims the government also engaged in misconduct when it repeatedly questioned him about his prior drug use and involvement in drug trafficking during his cross-examination and when it returned to this theme in closing arguments. He argues that these questions and closing statements constitute misconduct and violate FED.R.EVID. 404(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On several occasions during Robinson's cross-examination, the government attempted to question him about his history in dealing and using drugs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> At a sidebar after repeated defense objections, the government told the district court that it was not inquiring about prior bad acts, but rather showing that Robinson knew about the dangers of dealing drugs in order to prove the \"in furtherance\" element of possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense. Several times after the sidebar, the government again attempted to ask Robinson about his drug dealing history in an effort to prove why he would bring a gun to a drug deal and how he knew prices of drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidence of \"a defendant's other bad acts [is proper] only if that evidence meets the requirements of both Rule 404(b) and Rule 403.\" <i>United States v. Tse,</i> 375 F.3d 148, 155 (1st Cir.2004). Rule 404(b) evidence must be \"specially relevant\" and cannot \"include bad character or propensity as a necessary link in the inferential chain.\" <i>United States v. Flemmi,</i> 402 F.3d 79, 91 (1st Cir.2005); <i>United States v. Washington,</i> 434 F.3d 7, 12 (1st Cir.2006). Even assuming that the district court properly excluded the government's questions to Robinson about his prior history, Robinson cannot show prejudice from these questions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robinson claims that the mere asking of these questions was prejudicial. <i>See United States v. Meserve,</i> 271 F.3d 314, 326 (1st Cir.2001) (\"[T]he question itself may nevertheless prejudice a defendant because of the weight a jury gives to the questions asked by a prosecutor.\"). However, Robinson never answered many of the questions because the court sustained his objections. Thus, the required showing of prejudice becomes more difficult. <i>See id.</i> (noting that where challenged questions are left unanswered, the harmless error analysis is likely to weigh in favor of the appellee); <i>see also United States v. Innamorati,</i> 996 F.2d 456, 485 (1st Cir. 1993) (prejudicial effect of challenged questions lessened when questions were not answered).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to a question asked without objection, Robinson admitted that it was not out of the ordinary for him to be selling drugs. Moreover, on the third day of the trial, Robinson pled guilty to the two drug charges. At this point, the jury had heard considerable evidence regarding Robinson's drug deal with DiTullio. Therefore, it is difficult to see how the questions prejudiced Robinson.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robinson cites to two main cases to support his contention that reversal is required. However, these cases are distinguishable. First, he cites <i>United States v. Crawford,</i> 438 F.2d 441 (8th Cir.1971). In that case, the prosecution asked questions insinuating that the defendant was a member of a group of narcotics users and sellers. The court found reversible error, in part, because the only purpose in asking those questions was to \"degrade the defendant and to prejudice the jury against him.\" <i>Id.</i> at 444-45. Here, the government did have a legitimate purpose in asking the questions: to provide the jury with a reason why Robinson would bring a firearm to a drug deal. The misconduct inherent in the baseless attacks in <i>Crawford</i> is not present here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robinson similarly cites to <i>United States v. Newman,</i> 49 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.1995). In that case, we found error in the government's questions of whether the defendant knew what a \"con man\" or \"confidence game\" was. As was the case in <i>Crawford,</i> we found the government had \"no justifiable purpose for that line of questioning, other than, as [the defendant] suggests, to discredit him by insinuation.\" <i>Id.</i> at 8. Again, the same is not true here because the government did have a legitimate reason for pursuing its line of questioning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robinson next claims the prosecution committed reversible error when it asked him on cross-examination whether two law enforcement witnesses lied on the witness stand. Agent Genese had testified that when he asked Robinson whether he knew the cocaine he sold to DiTullio was real or fake, Robinson responded that he did not know. During Robinson's cross-examination, he denied saying that he was unsure what he sold. The prosecution then asked him if Agent Genese was lying.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At another point, Officer Conners testified that he heard Robinson state that when the officers surrounded him just prior to his arrest, he could have gone \"boom, boom.\" During Robinson's cross-examination, he denied making the statement and responded that Officer Conners could have been mistaken. The government then asked Robinson if Conners was lying, to which he answered that he did not know and was unable to say.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"This Court has held it is improper for an attorney to ask a witness whether another witness lied on the stand.\" <i>United States v. Thiongo,</i> 344 F.3d 55, 61 (1st Cir.2003) (citing <i>United States v. Gaines,</i> 170 F.3d 72, 81 (1st Cir.1999)) (noting that such practice is improper because credibility judgments are for the jury). Furthermore, \"[g]iven the faith that the jury may place in the word of a law enforcement officer, it is unfair to force a criminal defendant to choose between recanting and calling a law officer a liar.\" <i>United States v. Fernandez,</i> 145 F.3d 59, 64 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Robinson objected to the government's question asking whether Agent Genese was lying, it is reviewed for harmless error. <i>See United States v. Sullivan,</i> 85 F.3d 743, 750 (1st Cir.1996) (analyzing a similar question under the harmless error standard). While the question was improper, any resulting error was harmless because the district court sustained Robinson's objection and relieved him from answering. Robinson was not forced \"to choose between recanting and calling a law officer a liar.\" <i>Fernandez,</i> 145 F.3d at 64. The only benefit the government gained from the question was highlighting the discrepancy between the testimony of Agent Genese and Robinson. As was the case in <i>Sullivan,</i> \"[t]hat there was a contradiction between [Robinson's] testimony and [Agent Genese's] was obvious. Pointing out the obvious most likely scored the government, at most, rhetorical points.\" <i>Sullivan,</i> 85 F.3d at 750.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robinson did not object when the government asked him if Officer Connors was lying. Therefore, we review this question for plain error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> <i>See Fernandez,</i> 145 F.3d at 64. \"[T]o constitute plain error [the questions] must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\" <i>Id.</i> The prosecution's question here was not plain error because Robinson fails to show prejudice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Similar to the question about Agent Genese's testimony, this question merely drew the jury's attention to the discrepancy between Robinson's and Officer Conner's testimony. Thus, it is difficult to imagine that \"the improper framing of these unobjected-to questions affected the outcome of the trial.\" <i>Fernandez,</i> 145 F.3d at 65.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robinson also argues that the government continued to impermissibly vouch for the law enforcement officers in its closing argument. In relevant part, the prosecutor argued:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ladies and gentleman, if you believe that the officers of the United States, if you believe that these agents got on that stand with all those years of experience and in the face of their oath stood up there and lied in their testimony and you believe they did that, then acquit the defendant. Then acquit the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because there was no contemporaneous objection, we review for plain error. <i>United States v. Wilkerson,</i> 411 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.2005). Improper vouching occurs when the government \"place[s] the prestige of the United States behind a witness by making personal assurances about the credibility of a witness,\" <i>United States v. Rosario-Diaz,</i> 202 F.3d 54, 65 (1st Cir.2000), or implies \"that the jury should credit the government's evidence simply because the government can be trusted.\" <i>United States v. Perez-Ruiz,</i> 353 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.2003). The government's statement in this case did neither and does not constitute plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's statement merely invited the jurors to acquit Robinson if they believed that Agent Genese and Officer Conners were lying. This is not the type of improper vouching present in <i>Rosario-Diaz</i> or <i>Perez-Ruiz</i> because the government neither made statements about the witnesses' credibility nor implied that they could be trusted based on their affiliation with the United States. Moreover, these statements do not rise to the level of plain error. <i>See Wilkerson,</i> 411 F.3d at 8 (no plain error where prosecutor's rebuttal included statement that officers \"didn't stretch the truth here\"); <i>Sullivan,</i> 85 F.3d at 751 (no plain error where government's closing argument stated that one witness \"came off pretty believable,\" another \"couldn't have lied about anything,\" and that all of them \"were telling the truth\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to arguing that the government improperly vouched for law enforcement witnesses in its closing argument, Robinson alleges other instances of prejudice in the government's summation. Because he failed to object to the government's closing argument, we review for plain error. <i>Sullivan,</i> 85 F.3d at 751. We \"will not notice error unless it caused `a miscarriage of justice' or seriously undermined `the integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.'\" <i>United States v. Josleyn,</i> 99 F.3d 1182, 1198 (1st Cir.1996); <i>see also United States v. Taylor,</i> 54 F.3d 967, 977 (1st Cir.1995) (referring to this standard as \"hard-to-satisfy\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robinson claims that the government's first statement in its closing argument directed the jury to convict him based on his alleged life of crime rather than his alleged possession of firearms.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While \"arguments urging a jury to act in any capacity other than as the impartial arbiter of the facts in the case before it are improper,\" <i>United States v. Manning,</i> 23 F.3d 570, 574 (1st Cir.1994), the government's closing argument in this case did not request the jury to act in that manner. \"In assaying the appropriateness of a prosecutor's remarks, context frequently determines meaning.\" <i>United States v. Sepulveda,</i> 15 F.3d 1161, 1187 (1st Cir.1993). Here, the discussion following the challenged statement focused on the facts attendant to Robinson's arrest, not to his prior drug dealing. The government then spoke for some time about the fundamentals of the law of the case before it mentioned Robinson and his alleged life of crime. Even when the government did mention his prior history, it constituted only a small portion of the entire summation. Taken in context, the prosecutor's remarks are not plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robinson next alleges that the government's closing argument impermissibly returned to his history as a drug dealer. Robinson's brief selectively excerpts sentences from the government's summation and dissects each sentence to arrive at his conclusion that the closing was plain error. However, we must view the context of the remarks in determining whether error exists. <i>Id.</i> Viewed accordingly, these remarks are not plain error. The government's closing argument focused on the uncertainty surrounding the drug deal and the notion that drug dealers, including Robinson, bring guns to drug deals to protect themselves. The government merely repeated what Robinson admitted to, without objection, on cross-examination: that he knew the \"ways of the world\" and about drug deals in general.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The closest the government came to impermissibly prejudicing the jury in its closing argument was when it concluded its rebuttal:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I would suggest to you, ladies and gentlemen . . . that [Robinson is] guilty of possessing those guns in furtherance of that drug deal in which anything could have happened and probably something would have happened had it been a real drug dealer and not a DEA undercover agent who was getting ripped off by the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While it is improper to \"needlessly arouse the emotions of the jury,\" <i>United States v. Pirovolos,</i> 844 F.2d 415, 425 (7th Cir.1988), by resorting to unsupported hypotheticals, the error here does not result in a \"miscarriage of justice.\" The court instructed the jury that same afternoon that closing arguments were not to be considered as evidence. Therefore, the hypothetical was not plain error. <i>See United States v. Procopio,</i> 88 F.3d 21 (1st Cir.1996) (no plain error, in light of a curative instruction, despite only circumstantial evidence of guilt and \"seriously careless\" comment by prosecutor).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robinson argues that even if any of the alleged prosecutorial errors do not, by themselves, require reversal, the totality of the government's misconduct compels the conclusion that Robinson was denied a fair trial. We do not accept Robinson's premise that every evidentiary error in a criminal trial amounts to government misconduct. Nevertheless, for ease, we will use the misconduct test to address his arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We weigh several factors in determining \"whether prosecutorial misconduct has so poisoned the well that a new trial is required: (1) the severity of the misconduct; (2) the context in which it occurred; (3) whether the judge gave any curative instructions and the likely effect of such instructions; and (4) the strength of the evidence against the defendant.\" <i>United States v. Casas,</i> 425 F.3d 23, 38 (1st Cir. 2005), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 1670, 164 L.Ed.2d 409 (2006). This analysis focuses on the underlying fairness of the trial. <i>Meserve,</i> 271 F.3d at 332. In this case, the government's actions do not require reversal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the government's conduct was not as severe as Robinson alleges. While some of the prosecutor's questions regarding Robinson's history of drug dealing may have been improper, their sole purpose, unlike in <i>Newman,</i> was not to paint Robinson as an evil character, but to show his motivation for carrying a firearm to a drug deal. The government also appealed to the jury's emotions in closing, perhaps needlessly, but considering the context of the entire closing argument and rebuttal, the statements were not highly prejudicial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, we should look at the time when the alleged misconduct occurred. The government properly elicited testimony about the drug deal with DiTullio because at the time it asked those questions, Robinson had not yet formally pled guilty to those charges. Once Robinson entered a formal guilty plea, the government shifted its focus from the drug deal to the gun possession. Therefore, the government did not cause the jury to be unnecessarily focused on the drug charges and the questions did not heighten prejudice or create confusion as Robinson suggests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, while the district court gave no curative instructions, Robinson requested none. The district court did give general instructions before deliberations regarding what the jury could and could not consider as evidence, including questions with sustained objections, opening statements, and closing arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, evidence of Robinson's guilt was neither exceptionally weak nor exceptionally strong. The government introduced sufficient evidence to convict Robinson on the firearms charges, but this evidence did require a finding of constructive possession.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking these factors together, Robinson was not sufficiently prejudiced to entitle him to a new trial. The underlying fairness of the trial was not compromised because, although there may have been error, it was not sufficiently linked to the outcome so as to require a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robinson next argues that the government failed to produce sufficient evidence at trial to prove that he knowingly possessed a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime. He contends that the evidence indicates that he had no role in hiding the guns or was even aware of their existence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to prove possession of a firearm, the government must show actual possession or constructive possession. Constructive possession \"exists when a person knowingly has the power and intention at a given time to exercise dominion or control over the area where the contraband is found.\" <i>United States v. McLean,</i> 409 F.3d 492, 501 (1st Cir.2005) (internal quotations marks and citations omitted). \"[T]he requisite knowledge and intention may be inferred from circumstances . . . . [b]ut knowledge must be fairly inferable from the circumstances.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>United States v. Zavala Maldonado,</i> 23 F.3d 4, 7 (1st Cir.1994)). \"Constructive possession of a firearm may be established by showing that the person knows (or has reason to know) that the firearm is within easy reach, so that he can take actual possession of it virtually at will.\" <i>United States v. Lamare,</i> 711 F.2d 3, 5-6 (1st Cir.1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence was sufficient to permit a rational jury to conclude that Robinson constructively possessed the firearms found in the engine compartment. First, even though the evidence showed that Robinson neither rented the Ford in which the firearms were found, nor owned the firearms,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> constructive possession does not require ownership of either the guns or the area in which they are located. All that is necessary is that the defendant knowingly have the ability and intent to exercise dominion and control of the firearm or area where it is located. <i>See United States v.

Even though the Ford was rented to Mercer, Robinson's relationship with Tucker provided him with ample opportunity to store the guns in the engine compartment. Evidence was presented that Robinson and Tucker were friends, that Mercer left the keys to the Ford in various locations around the house where Tucker and Robinson would have easy access to them, and that Robinson was part of a group who was to drive the Ford to New Jersey for a trip.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, a rational jury could have interpreted Robinson's statement to Barnes in the holding cell that \"When they came from everywhere, I could have gone boom, boom,\" to mean that Robinson could have shot the agents using the firearms found in the Ford.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robinson contends that even if the evidence was sufficient to prove that he knowingly possessed firearms, there was insufficient evidence to prove that he possessed the firearms in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c), the government must prove that the firearm was possessed \"to advance or promote the commission of the underlying offense. The mere presence of a firearm in an area where a criminal act occurs is not a sufficient basis for imposing [the] mandatory sentence [under &#167; 924(c)].\" <i>United States v. Grace,</i> 367 F.3d 29, 35 (1st Cir.2004). There must be some sufficient nexus between the firearm and the drug trafficking offense. While a sufficient nexus is more readily found in cases where the firearm is in plain view and accessible to the defendant during a drug trafficking offense, <i>see United States v. Felton,</i> 417 F.3d 97, 106 (1st Cir.2005); <i>United States v. Garner,</i> 338 F.3d 78, 81 (1st Cir.2003), we have found a sufficient nexus to exist where the drugs and firearms were not jointly located and easily accessible. <i>See United States v. Carlos Cruz,</i> 352 F.3d 499, 509 (1st Cir.2003) (rifles located inside a nearby trash can and covered with blankets while drugs were located on defendant's person). In these cases, we weigh several factors: whether the firearm was loaded, whether the firearm was easily accessible, the proximity of the firearm to the drugs, and the surrounding circumstances. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the jury had ample reason to conclude that Robinson possessed the firearms in furtherance of the drug deal with DiTullio. Both firearms hidden in the Ford were loaded and were accessible by Robinson during the drug deal with DiTullio. All Robinson had to do to gain actual possession of the firearms was to open the Ford's hood three to six inches and reach inside the engine compartment. Moreover, because Robinson had the drugs on his person when he was inside the car and subsequently opened the hood, the firearms were within close proximity to the drugs. Also, a jury could have concluded that Robinson was in charge of the drug deal and that the firearms were available if necessary because Robinson drove the car and took charge when the drug deal appeared as if it would not happen. Therefore, sufficient evidence existed for the jury to find that Robinson possessed the firearms in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robinson's final claim is that the district court erred at sentencing. He contends that \"[t]he district court erroneously believed it was constrained by the United States Sentencing Guidelines (`Guidelines') when it sentenced\" him to 137 months. Specifically, he points to the district court's comment that \"I think that &#8212; I don't have a whole lot of discretion here. I &#8212; but I don't see any reason to go to the high end of the advisory guideline range. I think 137 is the lowest I can do with the [60-]month consecutively-run sentence,\" as evidence that the district court misapprehended its discretion under the Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we have held that district courts must continue to consider the Guidelines sentencing range in calculating reasonable sentences. <i>United States v. Jimenez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d 514, 518 (1st Cir.2006) (en banc). This consideration should include \"the guideline range, any proposed departures, followed by the further determination whether other factors identified by either side warrant an ultimate sentence above or below the guideline range.\" <i>Id.</i> at 518-19. If a sentence falls outside the Guidelines range, the district court must provide justification, which may be either express or inferred. <i>Id.</i> at 519.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robinson's claim fails for two reasons. First, the district court clearly understood <i>Booker's</i> holding because it explicitly referred to the Guidelines range as \"advisory\" in determining Robinson's sentence. Second, the district court's statement regarding its apparent lack of discretion does not appear to refer to its inability to depart downward under the Guidelines because of their mandatory nature. Rather, that statement reflects the district court's conclusion that after considering all relevant sentencing factors, it could not provide adequate reasoning for imposing a sentence below the advisory Guidelines range. In order to depart downward the district court would have been required to give an express or implied reason for doing so, and it felt it could not do so based on the evidence presented at sentencing. During Robinson's sentencing, the district court remarked that it was troubled by Robinson's belief that this case \"was no big deal,\" his inability to stay out of trouble at home, and his apparently fabricated testimony. Considering these statements in light of the record, <i>see Jimenez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d at 519, as well as the district court's characterization of the Guidelines as \"advisory,\" we find no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we AFFIRM Robinson's convictions and sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Ford was rented to Cleo Mercer, the sister of Stephen Tucker</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Conflicting testimony was presented at trial regarding Robinson's conduct in exiting the car and moving to the front of the hood.

Unable to locate any crack cocaine for the deal, Ellard contacted Willie Hester, whom he had seen packaging crack on a previous occasion with another man, Norman Barnes. Hester agreed to sell Ellard sixty-two grams of crack cocaine, but conditioned the sale on his accompanying Ellard to the deal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hester picked up Ellard in a Honda, followed by a Ford<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> with New Hampshire plates. The Ford had three occupants: Robinson in the driver's seat, Stephen Tucker in the front passenger seat, and Barnes in the back. The two cars traveled to a parking lot in Dorchester to complete the deal with DiTullio. Ellard exited the Honda and entered the passenger side of DiTullio's vehicle. He told DiTullio that the crack cocaine was in the Ford and requested the $2,350. DiTullio showed Ellard the money, let him count it, but would not give it to him unless he produced the crack cocaine. Ellard returned to the Honda to consult with Hester, who told him to go speak with Barnes in the Ford. Barnes informed Ellard he would not produce the drugs without any money. In an attempt to compromise, Ellard had DiTullio back his vehicle up to the rear of the Ford. DiTullio again refused to give Ellard the money without the drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Frustrated at the stalled deal, Robinson exited the driver's seat of the Ford, walked to the front of the hood for a few moments,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and then proceeded to DiTullio's vehicle. Speaking with DiTullio through the passenger window, Robinson removed a clear plastic bag<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> from his jacket pocket and placed it on the front passenger seat. DiTullio gave Robinson the money, and Robinson began walking back to the Ford. As law enforcement officers moved in for an arrest, Robinson fled briefly before being apprehended. He was arrested and police found $2,350 and a clear plastic bag containing marijuana and crack cocaine in his possession.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After seizure of the Ford, an inspection at a garage revealed two loaded semiautomatic pistols wrapped in a T-shirt and hidden inside a small space in front of the engine compartment near the front of the hood.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day, Officer Conners overheard Robinson and Barnes conversing in their shared holding cell.

We address each issue in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robinson's first argument is that the prosecution repeatedly engaged in a pattern of misconduct during both cross-examination and closing argument when it systematically portrayed him as a habitual drug user and career drug dealer. He contends that the government's questions about the drug deal with DiTullio and repeated questions and references to his prior history of drug trafficking constitute reversible error because they confused the jury into convicting him on the gun charges based mostly on his prior history of drug trafficking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robinson argues that the government improperly elicited prejudicial testimony regarding the drug deal with DiTullio. According to Robinson, such testimony was unnecessary because he never challenged his guilt: defense counsel informed the government prior to trial that he would not deny his role in the drug deal with DiTullio, defense counsel's opening statement conceded his guilt to the drug trafficking charges, at no time during the trial did he otherwise contest his guilt, and on the morning of the third day he entered guilty pleas to both drug charges. Thus, he argues, the government was relieved of its burden to prove that Robinson engaged in drug trafficking as part of its charge that he possessed a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense. Robinson contends that the sole reason the government focused on this drug deal was to make the jury believe it was to convict him for his drug trafficking activities and not the firearms charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is unavailing for several reasons. First, although he conceded his role in the drug deal with DiTullio prior to trial and during his opening statement, Robinson remained free to change his mind whether he would contest both drug trafficking charges at some point in the trial. He did not formally enter guilty pleas to both charges until the morning of the third day of trial, and until that time the government still had the burden to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, it was proper to present evidence that Robinson engaged in drug trafficking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robinson claims the government also engaged in misconduct when it repeatedly questioned him about his prior drug use and involvement in drug trafficking during his cross-examination and when it returned to this theme in closing arguments. He argues that these questions and closing statements constitute misconduct and violate FED.R.EVID. 404(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On several occasions during Robinson's cross-examination, the government attempted to question him about his history in dealing and using drugs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> At a sidebar after repeated defense objections, the government told the district court that it was not inquiring about prior bad acts, but rather showing that Robinson knew about the dangers of dealing drugs in order to prove the \"in furtherance\" element of possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense. Several times after the sidebar, the government again attempted to ask Robinson about his drug dealing history in an effort to prove why he would bring a gun to a drug deal and how he knew prices of drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidence of \"a defendant's other bad acts [is proper] only if that evidence meets the requirements of both Rule 404(b) and Rule 403.\" <i>United States v.

Even assuming that the district court properly excluded the government's questions to Robinson about his prior history, Robinson cannot show prejudice from these questions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robinson claims that the mere asking of these questions was prejudicial. <i>See United States v.

However, Robinson never answered many of the questions because the court sustained his objections. Thus, the required showing of prejudice becomes more difficult. <i>See id.</i> (noting that where challenged questions are left unanswered, the harmless error analysis is likely to weigh in favor of the appellee); <i>see also United States v.

Moreover, on the third day of the trial, Robinson pled guilty to the two drug charges. At this point, the jury had heard considerable evidence regarding Robinson's drug deal with DiTullio. Therefore, it is difficult to see how the questions prejudiced Robinson.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robinson cites to two main cases to support his contention that reversal is required. However, these cases are distinguishable. First, he cites <i>United States v.

In that case, the prosecution asked questions insinuating that the defendant was a member of a group of narcotics users and sellers. The court found reversible error, in part, because the only purpose in asking those questions was to \"degrade the defendant and to prejudice the jury against him.\" <i>Id.</i> at 444-45. Here, the government did have a legitimate purpose in asking the questions: to provide the jury with a reason why Robinson would bring a firearm to a drug deal. The misconduct inherent in the baseless attacks in <i>Crawford</i> is not present here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robinson similarly cites to <i>United States v.

In that case, we found error in the government's questions of whether the defendant knew what a \"con man\" or \"confidence game\" was. As was the case in <i>Crawford,</i> we found the government had \"no justifiable purpose for that line of questioning, other than, as [the defendant] suggests, to discredit him by insinuation.\" <i>Id.</i> at 8.

Agent Genese had testified that when he asked Robinson whether he knew the cocaine he sold to DiTullio was real or fake, Robinson responded that he did not know. During Robinson's cross-examination, he denied saying that he was unsure what he sold. The prosecution then asked him if Agent Genese was lying.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At another point, Officer Conners testified that he heard Robinson state that when the officers surrounded him just prior to his arrest, he could have gone \"boom, boom.\" During Robinson's cross-examination, he denied making the statement and responded that Officer Conners could have been mistaken. The government then asked Robinson if Conners was lying, to which he answered that he did not know and was unable to say.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"This Court has held it is improper for an attorney to ask a witness whether another witness lied on the stand.\" <i>United States v.

While the question was improper, any resulting error was harmless because the district court sustained Robinson's objection and relieved him from answering. Robinson was not forced \"to choose between recanting and calling a law officer a liar.\" <i>Fernandez,</i> 145 F.3d at 64. The only benefit the government gained from the question was highlighting the discrepancy between the testimony of Agent Genese and Robinson. As was the case in <i>Sullivan,</i> \"[t]hat there was a contradiction between [Robinson's] testimony and [Agent Genese's] was obvious.

This is not the type of improper vouching present in <i>Rosario-Diaz</i> or <i>Perez-Ruiz</i> because the government neither made statements about the witnesses' credibility nor implied that they could be trusted based on their affiliation with the United States. Moreover, these statements do not rise to the level of plain error. <i>See Wilkerson,</i> 411 F.3d at 8 (no plain error where prosecutor's rebuttal included statement that officers \"didn't stretch the truth here\"); <i>Sullivan,</i> 85 F.3d at 751 (no plain error where government's closing argument stated that one witness \"came off pretty believable,\" another \"couldn't have lied about anything,\" and that all of them \"were telling the truth\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to arguing that the government improperly vouched for law enforcement witnesses in its closing argument, Robinson alleges other instances of prejudice in the government's summation.

Here, the discussion following the challenged statement focused on the facts attendant to Robinson's arrest, not to his prior drug dealing. The government then spoke for some time about the fundamentals of the law of the case before it mentioned Robinson and his alleged life of crime. Even when the government did mention his prior history, it constituted only a small portion of the entire summation.

Robinson's brief selectively excerpts sentences from the government's summation and dissects each sentence to arrive at his conclusion that the closing was plain error. However, we must view the context of the remarks in determining whether error exists. <i>Id.</i> Viewed accordingly, these remarks are not plain error. The government's closing argument focused on the uncertainty surrounding the drug deal and the notion that drug dealers, including Robinson, bring guns to drug deals to protect themselves. The government merely repeated what Robinson admitted to, without objection, on cross-examination: that he knew the \"ways of the world\" and about drug deals in general.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The closest the government came to impermissibly prejudicing the jury in its closing argument was when it concluded its rebuttal:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I would suggest to you, ladies and gentlemen . . . that [Robinson is] guilty of possessing those guns in furtherance of that drug deal in which anything could have happened and probably something would have happened had it been a real drug dealer and not a DEA undercover agent who was getting ripped off by the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While it is improper to \"needlessly arouse the emotions of the jury,\" <i>United States v.

Therefore, the hypothetical was not plain error. <i>See United States v.

While some of the prosecutor's questions regarding Robinson's history of drug dealing may have been improper, their sole purpose, unlike in <i>Newman,</i> was not to paint Robinson as an evil character, but to show his motivation for carrying a firearm to a drug deal. The government also appealed to the jury's emotions in closing, perhaps needlessly, but considering the context of the entire closing argument and rebuttal, the statements were not highly prejudicial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, we should look at the time when the alleged misconduct occurred. The government properly elicited testimony about the drug deal with DiTullio because at the time it asked those questions, Robinson had not yet formally pled guilty to those charges. Once Robinson entered a formal guilty plea, the government shifted its focus from the drug deal to the gun possession. Therefore, the government did not cause the jury to be unnecessarily focused on the drug charges and the questions did not heighten prejudice or create confusion as Robinson suggests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, while the district court gave no curative instructions, Robinson requested none. The district court did give general instructions before deliberations regarding what the jury could and could not consider as evidence, including questions with sustained objections, opening statements, and closing arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, evidence of Robinson's guilt was neither exceptionally weak nor exceptionally strong. The government introduced sufficient evidence to convict Robinson on the firearms charges, but this evidence did require a finding of constructive possession.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking these factors together, Robinson was not sufficiently prejudiced to entitle him to a new trial. The underlying fairness of the trial was not compromised because, although there may have been error, it was not sufficiently linked to the outcome so as to require a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robinson next argues that the government failed to produce sufficient evidence at trial to prove that he knowingly possessed a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime. He contends that the evidence indicates that he had no role in hiding the guns or was even aware of their existence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to prove possession of a firearm, the government must show actual possession or constructive possession.

In these cases, we weigh several factors: whether the firearm was loaded, whether the firearm was easily accessible, the proximity of the firearm to the drugs, and the surrounding circumstances. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the jury had ample reason to conclude that Robinson possessed the firearms in furtherance of the drug deal with DiTullio. Both firearms hidden in the Ford were loaded and were accessible by Robinson during the drug deal with DiTullio. All Robinson had to do to gain actual possession of the firearms was to open the Ford's hood three to six inches and reach inside the engine compartment. Moreover, because Robinson had the drugs on his person when he was inside the car and subsequently opened the hood, the firearms were within close proximity to the drugs. Also, a jury could have concluded that Robinson was in charge of the drug deal and that the firearms were available if necessary because Robinson drove the car and took charge when the drug deal appeared as if it would not happen. Therefore, sufficient evidence existed for the jury to find that Robinson possessed the firearms in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robinson's final claim is that the district court erred at sentencing. He contends that \"[t]he district court erroneously believed it was constrained by the United States Sentencing Guidelines (`Guidelines') when it sentenced\" him to 137 months. Specifically, he points to the district court's comment that \"I think that &#8212; I don't have a whole lot of discretion here. I &#8212; but I don't see any reason to go to the high end of the advisory guideline range. I think 137 is the lowest I can do with the [60-]month consecutively-run sentence,\" as evidence that the district court misapprehended its discretion under the Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since <i>United States v. Booker,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></span> (2005), we have held that district courts must continue to consider the Guidelines sentencing range in calculating reasonable sentences. <i>United States v. Jimenez-Beltre,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202092\"><a href=\"/opinion/202092/united-states-v-jimenez-beltre/\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">514</span></a></span>, 518 (1st Cir.2006) (en banc). This consideration should include \"the guideline range, any proposed departures, followed by the further determination whether other factors identified by either side warrant an ultimate sentence above or below the guideline range.\" <i>Id.</i> at 518-19. If a sentence falls outside the Guidelines range, the district court must provide justification, which may be either express or inferred. <i>Id.</i> at 519.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robinson's claim fails for two reasons. First, the district court clearly understood <i>Booker's</i> holding because it explicitly referred to the Guidelines range as \"advisory\" in determining Robinson's sentence. Second, the district court's statement regarding its apparent lack of discretion does not appear to refer to its inability to depart downward under the Guidelines because of their mandatory nature. Rather, that statement reflects the district court's conclusion that after considering all relevant sentencing factors, it could not provide adequate reasoning for imposing a sentence below the advisory Guidelines range. In order to depart downward the district court would have been required to give an express or implied reason for doing so, and it felt it could not do so based on the evidence presented at sentencing. During Robinson's sentencing, the district court remarked that it was troubled by Robinson's belief that this case \"was no big deal,\" his inability to stay out of trouble at home, and his apparently fabricated testimony. Considering these statements in light of the record, <i>see Jimenez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d at 519, as well as the district court's characterization of the Guidelines as \"advisory,\" we find no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we AFFIRM Robinson's convictions and sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Ford was rented to Cleo Mercer, the sister of Stephen Tucker</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Conflicting testimony was presented at trial regarding Robinson's conduct in exiting the car and moving to the front of the hood.
