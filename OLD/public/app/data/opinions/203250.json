Luis Morales-Tañon appeals the\n\ndismissal of his political discrimination and due process claims\n\nagainst his employer, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority\n\n(\"PREPA\"), and various of its representatives.              Morales-Tañon\n\nbrought suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, claiming violations of his\n\nFirst, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights; he also alleged\n\nviolations of Puerto Rico law. The district court dismissed all of\n\nplaintiff's claims, and we affirm.\n\n          Because plaintiff's claims were dismissed under Federal\n\nRule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), we accept the well-pleaded\n\nallegations    in   plaintiff's   complaint    as   true   and   draw    all\n\nreasonable inferences in his favor. Parker v. Hurley, 514 F.3d 87,\n\n90 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n          Morales-Tañon, an attorney, has held a career position as\n\na member of PREPA's Auction Committee since 1997.          The complaint\n\ngives no information about what the Auction Committee does.             He is\n\nan active member of the New Progressive Party (\"NPP\"), which\n\ncontrolled the government in Puerto Rico at the time of his\n\nappointment.    The 2000 elections, however, brought the Popular\n\nDemocratic Party (\"PDP\") into power.          The new administration in\n\n2002 increased the size of PREPA's Auction Committee from three to\n\nfive members, with the two new members being PDP adherents.             PREPA\n\nofficials then ceased appointing Morales-Tañon to temporary terms\n\nas acting president of the Auction Committee, appointing the new\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fPDP committee members instead.           They did this even though the two\n\nnew individuals were not yet (according to Morales-Tañon) full\n\npermanent members of the committee.\n\n            In January 2006, the president of the committee formally\n\nretired.    At the time of the filing of this complaint, PREPA had\n\nyet to start the appointment process for a replacement president.\n\nThis takes us to the crux of Morales-Tañon's complaint: that PREPA\n\nhas not yet opened up the presidency position \"for no other reason\n\nthan to discriminate against Plaintiff by allowing the newly\n\nappointed members of the PDP to obtain their status as permanent\n\nmembers    of    the   Auction    Committee     and   thus[]    qualify    for   an\n\nappointment as President . . ., all in retaliation for Plaintiff's\n\npolitical activities in support of the NPP.\"                   Plaintiff asserts\n\nthat he is the only member of the committee who is currently\n\nqualified to hold the presidency.              Morales-Tañon also amended his\n\ncomplaint       to   add   allegations     of    continuing     harassment       and\n\nretaliation. The alleged retaliation is his receipt of a reprimand\n\nfor raising his voice to a co-worker and an ethics charge for\n\nengaging in private practice outside work hours, both of which\n\nactions were taken in January 2007.\n\n            Morales-Tañon brought suit in federal district court in\n\nNovember    2006,      alleging   that    defendants    deprived     him   \"of     a\n\nreasonable employment promotion expectation\" in violation of his\n\nFirst Amendment and due process rights. He sought compensatory and\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fpunitive damages and requested that the court either order PREPA to\n\nretroactively instate him as president (a position he has never\n\nheld) or to start the appointment process.\n\n            Defendants moved for dismissal, arguing that Morales-\n\nTañon had failed to state a cognizable constitutional claim under\n\n§ 1983 and that many of his claims under § 1983 were also time-\n\nbarred.      The    district     court    agreed.     It    found   plaintiff's\n\nallegations regarding the 2002 change in the Auction Committee's\n\ncomposition barred by the statute of limitations. It ruled out the\n\ndue process claim because Morales-Tañon had not identified a\n\nrecognized    and    protected     property      interest   of   which   he   was\n\ndeprived,    and    it   found    no     First    Amendment-based     political\n\ndiscrimination claim because plaintiff had not alleged any adverse\n\nemployment action.       As to the amended complaint, the court found\n\nthe complaint had not pled any facts from which an inference could\n\nbe drawn of a connection between the reprimand and ethics charge\n\nand   Morales-Tañon's     political       affiliation.       The    court     thus\n\ndismissed the § 1983 claims with prejudice and, declining to\n\nexercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law\n\nclaims, dismissed those claims without prejudice.\n\n            Our review of Rule 12(b)(6) dismissals is de novo.\n\nParker, 514 F.3d at 95.        The district court's unpublished opinion\n\ncarefully and correctly analyzed plaintiff's claims; we thus keep\n\nour analysis brief.\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\f           To survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a\n\nclaim, a complaint must contain factual allegations sufficient to\n\n\"raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\"          Bell Atl.\n\nCorp. v. Twombly, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 1965 (2007).        \"While a complaint\n\nattacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss does not need\n\ndetailed factual allegations, a plaintiff's obligation to provide\n\nthe 'grounds' of his 'entitle[ment] to relief' requires more than\n\nlabels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements\n\nof a cause of action will not do.\"       Id. at 1964-65 (quoting Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 8(a)(2)) (alteration in original) (citations omitted).\n\n           Bell Atlantic \"retire[d]\" the seemingly broader language\n\nregarding pleading standards in Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41\n\n(1957).    Bell Atl. Corp., 127 S. Ct. at 1969.        Specifically, the\n\nCourt cabined Conley's language that \"a complaint should not be\n\ndismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond\n\ndoubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of\n\nhis claim which would entitle him to relief.\"        Conley, 355 U.S. at\n\n45-46.    The Court clarified that Conley \"described the breadth of\n\nopportunity to prove what an adequate complaint claims, not the\n\nminimum standard of adequate pleading to govern a complaint's\n\nsurvival.\"    Bell Atl. Corp., 127 S. Ct. at 1969; see also Damon v.\n\nMoore, ___ F.3d ___, 2008 WL 748269, at *3 (1st Cir. Mar. 21, 2008)\n\n(discussing   Bell   Atlantic's   retirement    of   Conley's   oft-quoted\n\nlanguage); Rodríguez-Ortiz v. Margo Caribe, Inc., 490 F.3d 92, 95-\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\f96 (1st Cir. 2007) (same).           Thus plaintiff's assertion that \"all\n\n[he] needs to plead is enough facts for the Honorable Court to be\n\nable       to   frame   a   constitutional    claim,\"   is   simply   wrong.     A\n\nplaintiff's complaint must itself frame a viable constitutional\n\nclaim.\n\n                In Puerto Rico, § 1983 claims are subject to a one-year\n\nstatute of limitations.           Marrero-Gutierrez v. Molina, 491 F.3d 1,\n\n5 (1st Cir. 2007).            The statute of limitations on such claims\n\nbegins to run when the injury occurs, even if the plaintiff did not\n\nknow of the discriminatory animus at that time.                Id. at 5-6.     The\n\ndistrict court clearly explained why the statute bars plaintiff's\n\n2006 attack on the 2002 change in the Auction Committee composition\n\nand correctly concluded that any after-effects did not fall within\n\nthe so-called continuing violation doctrine.1                See Limestone Dev.\n\nCorp. v. Vill. of Lemont, ___ F.3d ___, 2008 WL 852586, at *2-3\n\n(7th Cir. Apr. 1, 2008) (Posner, J.) (\"[T]he 'continuing violation'\n\ndoctrine is misnamed. . . . The office of the misnamed doctrine is\n\nto allow suit to be delayed until a series of wrongful acts\n\nblossoms into an injury on which suit can be brought.\").                       Any\n\ninjury to plaintiff from the 2002 actions was clear by 2003.\n\nFurther, plaintiff does not provide any legal argument or case\n\n\n       1\n          The alleged retaliatory reprimand and ethics charge in\nJanuary 2007 were not part of a continuing violation, the office\nwhich plaintiff assigned to them.    If they were meant to stand\nindependently, they fail because no allegation sufficiently\nconnects them to Morales-Tañon's political affiliations.\n\n                                        -7-\n\fcitations on appeal as to why the district court was wrong.                \"We\n\nhave    steadfastly   deemed   waived   issues   raised   on   appeal    in   a\n\nperfunctory manner, not accompanied by developed argumentation\n\n. . . .\"   United States v. Bongiorno, 106 F.3d 1027, 1034 (1st Cir.\n\n1997).\n\n            We turn then to plaintiff's timely claims regarding\n\nPREPA's failure to open the application process in order to fill\n\nthe position of the Auction Committee presidency after January\n\n2006.      \"The   First   Amendment   protects   non-policymaking       public\n\nemployees from adverse employment actions based on their political\n\nopinions.\" Marrero-Gutierrez, 491 F.3d at 9. To establish a prima\n\nfacie case of political discrimination in violation of the First\n\nAmendment, a government employee must demonstrate both that there\n\nwas an adverse employment action and that this adverse action was\n\nmotivated by discrimination on the basis of political affiliation.\n\nSee, e.g., Bisbal-Ramos v. City of Mayagüez, 467 F.3d 16, 22 (1st\n\nCir. 2006).\n\n            \"Adverse employment action\" includes not only discharge\n\nand demotions, but also a government entity's refusal to promote,\n\ntransfer, recall after layoff, or even hire an employee.           Rutan v.\n\nRepublican Party of Ill., 497 U.S. 62, 79 (1990).          As the district\n\ncourt noted, plaintiff has alleged no specific changes in his\n\nexisting working conditions.          Further, PREPA has not turned him\n\ndown for a promotion.       Morales-Tañon asserts only that PREPA has\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fnot begun accepting applications for a position for which he feels\n\neminently qualified.    As the district court summarized, \"[w]e have\n\nnot found, nor has Plaintiff cited to, a case where the failure to\n\nopen up a position in a timely fashion served as the basis for a\n\npolitical or employment discrimination claim.\" Plaintiff still has\n\nnot identified such a case on appeal.             We agree there is no\n\ncognizable adverse employment action here within the scope of\n\nRutan.   Plaintiff also makes no coherent claim of a violation of\n\nfree speech rights independent of his political affiliation claim.\n\n            Plaintiff's procedural due process rights claim does not\n\nfare better. The district court explicated and applied the correct\n\nstandard.      Morales-Tañon    argues      primarily     that   the   court\n\nimpermissibly reached this issue sua sponte.           We do not agree.\n\n            There is no concern about unfairness to plaintiff. While\n\ndefendants'   motion   to   dismiss   the   §   1983    claims   focused   on\n\nplaintiff's First Amendment arguments (which comprised the bulk of\n\nplaintiff's complaint), defendants moved to dismiss the entire\n\n§ 1983 cause of action for failure to state a claim, not just the\n\n§ 1983 claim premised on a First Amendment violation.            The motion\n\nalso referenced the very reason why the district court found the\n\ndue process claim to be meritless: \"the complaint does not allege\n\nthat [the presidency] position was adjudicated in property [sic] to\n\nanyone,\" that is, there was no assertion of a property interest.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\f          Fundamentally, plaintiff has failed to state a procedural\n\ndue process claim because he has not alleged a property interest\n\nunder state law in the opening of an application process for the\n\npresident's position.    See PFZ Props., Inc. v. Rodriguez, 928 F.2d\n\n28, 30 (1st Cir. 1991) (allegation of a property interest under\n\nstate law is required to establish a procedural due process claim);\n\ncf. Pérez-Acevedo v. Rivero-Cubano, ___ F.3d ___, 2008 WL 650665,\n\nat *2 (1st Cir. Mar. 12, 2008) (\"[T]o assume an entitlement\n\ngrounded in state law from a complaint that makes scant reference\n\nto an insufficiently identified statute would go against Bell\n\nAtlantic's admonition that a complaint's allegations must be more\n\nthan 'speculative.'\"). Even now Morales-Tañon has cited to nothing\n\nwhich would establish either a property interest on his part in the\n\npresident's   position   or   in   the    opening   of   the   position   for\n\ncompetitive selection.     Thus we agree that the allegations in the\n\ncomplaint, taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, fail\n\nto state a claim on which relief can be granted.\n\n          We affirm.     Costs are awarded to defendants.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\f",

Morales-Tañon brought suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, claiming violations of his First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights; he also alleged violations of Puerto Rico law. The district court dismissed all of plaintiff's claims, and we affirm.</p>\n<p>Because plaintiff's claims were dismissed under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), we accept the well-pleaded allegations in plaintiff's complaint as true and draw all reasonable inferences in his favor. <i>Parker v. Hurley,</i> 514 F.3d 87, 90 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>Morales-Tañon, an attorney, has held a career position as a member of PREPA's Auction Committee since 1997. The complaint gives no information about what the Auction Committee does. He is an active member of the New Progressive Party (\"NPP\"), which controlled the government in Puerto Rico at the time of his appointment. The 2000 elections, however, brought the Popular Democratic Party (\"PDP\") into power. The new administration in 2002 increased the size of PREPA's Auction Committee from three to five members, with the two new members being PDP adherents. PREPA officials then ceased appointing Morales-Tañon to temporary terms as acting president of the Auction Committee, appointing the new PDP committee members instead. They did this even though the two new individuals were not yet (according to Morales-Tañon) full permanent members of the committee.</p>\n<p>In January 2006, the president of the committee formally retired. At the time of the filing of this complaint, PREPA had yet to start the appointment process for a replacement president. This takes us to the crux of Morales-Tañon's complaint: that PREPA has not yet opened up the presidency position \"for no other reason than to discriminate against Plaintiff by allowing the newly appointed members of the PDP to obtain their status as permanent members of the Auction Committee and thus[ ] qualify for an appointment as President ..., all in retaliation for Plaintiff's political activities in support of the NPP.\" Plaintiff asserts that he is the only member of the committee who is currently qualified to hold the presidency. Morales-Tañon also amended his complaint to add allegations of continuing harassment and retaliation. The alleged retaliation is his receipt of a reprimand for raising his voice to a co-worker and an ethics charge for engaging in private practice outside work hours, both of which actions were taken in January 2007.</p>\n<p>Morales-Tañon brought suit in federal district court in November 2006, alleging that defendants deprived him \"of a reasonable employment promotion expectation\" in violation of his First Amendment and due process rights. He sought compensatory and punitive damages and requested that the court either order PREPA to retroactively instate him as president (a position he has never held) or to start the appointment process.</p>\n<p>Defendants moved for dismissal, arguing that Morales-Tañon had failed to state a cognizable constitutional claim under § 1983 and that many of his claims under § 1983 were also time-barred. The district court agreed. It found plaintiff's allegations regarding the 2002 change in the Auction Committee's composition barred by the statute of limitations. It ruled out the due process claim because Morales-Tañon had not identified a recognized and protected property interest of which he <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> was deprived, and it found no First Amendment-based political discrimination claim because plaintiff had not alleged any adverse employment action. As to the amended complaint, the court found the complaint had not pled any facts from which an inference could be drawn of a connection between the reprimand and ethics charge and Morales-Tañon's political affiliation. The court thus dismissed the § 1983 claims with prejudice and, declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims, dismissed those claims without prejudice.</p>\n<p>Our review of Rule 12(b)(6) dismissals is de novo. <i>Parker,</i> 514 F.3d at 95. The district court's unpublished opinion carefully and correctly analyzed plaintiff's claims; we thus keep our analysis brief.</p>\n<p>To survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, a complaint must contain factual allegations sufficient to \"raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\" <i>Bell Atl.

Corp. v. Vill. of Lemont,</i> 520 F.3d 797, 801 (7th Cir.2008) (Posner, J.) (\"[T]he `continuing violation' doctrine is misnamed.... The office of the misnamed doctrine is to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*19</span> allow suit to be delayed until a series of wrongful acts blossoms into an injury on which suit can be brought.\"). Any injury to plaintiff from the 2002 actions was clear by 2003. Further, plaintiff does not provide any legal argument or case citations on appeal as to why the district court was wrong. \"We have steadfastly deemed waived issues raised on appeal in a perfunctory manner, not accompanied by developed argumentation....\" <i>United States v. Bongiorno,</i> 106 F.3d 1027, 1034 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n<p>We turn then to plaintiff's timely claims regarding PREPA's failure to open the application process in order to fill the position of the Auction Committee presidency after January 2006. \"The First Amendment protects non-policymaking public employees from adverse employment actions based on their political opinions.\" <i>Marrero-Gutierrez,</i> 491 F.3d at 9. To establish a prima facie case of political discrimination in violation of the First Amendment, a government employee must demonstrate both that there was an adverse employment action and that this adverse action was motivated by discrimination on the basis of political affiliation. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Bisbal-Ramos v. City of Mayagüez,</i> 467 F.3d 16, 22 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>\"Adverse employment action\" includes not only discharge and demotions, but also a government entity's refusal to promote, transfer, recall after layoff, or even hire an employee. <i>Rutan v. Republican Party of Ill.,</i> 497 U.S. 62, 79, 110 S.Ct. 2729, 111 L.Ed.2d 52 (1990). As the district court noted, plaintiff has alleged no specific changes in his existing working conditions. Further, PREPA has not turned him down for a promotion. Morales-Tañon asserts only that PREPA has not begun accepting applications for a position for which he feels eminently qualified. As the district court summarized, \"[w]e have not found, nor has Plaintiff cited to, a case where the failure to open up a position in a timely fashion served as the basis for a political or employment discrimination claim.\" Plaintiff still has not identified such a case on appeal. We agree there is no cognizable adverse employment action here within the scope of <i>Rutan.</i> Plaintiff also makes no coherent claim of a violation of free speech rights independent of his political affiliation claim.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff's procedural due process rights claim does not fare better. The district court explicated and applied the correct standard. Morales-Tañon argues primarily that the court impermissibly reached this issue sua sponte. We do not agree.</p>\n<p>There is no concern about unfairness to plaintiff. While defendants' motion to dismiss the § 1983 claims focused on plaintiff's First Amendment arguments (which comprised the bulk of plaintiff's complaint), defendants moved to dismiss the entire § 1983 cause of action for failure to state a claim, not just the § 1983 claim premised on a First Amendment violation. The motion also referenced the very reason why the district court found the due process claim to be meritless: \"the complaint does not allege that [the presidency] position was adjudicated in property [sic] to anyone,\" that is, there was no assertion of a property interest.</p>\n<p>Fundamentally, plaintiff has failed to state a procedural due process claim because he has not alleged a property interest under state law in the opening of an application process for the president's position. <i>See </i><i>PFZ Props., Inc. v.

Even now Morales-Tañon has cited to nothing which would establish either a property interest on his part in the president's position or in the opening of the position for competitive selection.

Morales-Tañon brought suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, claiming violations of his First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights; he also alleged violations of Puerto Rico law. The district court dismissed all of plaintiff's claims, and we affirm.</p>\n<p>Because plaintiff's claims were dismissed under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), we accept the well-pleaded allegations in plaintiff's complaint as true and draw all reasonable inferences in his favor. <i>Parker v. Hurley,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></span>, 90 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>Morales-Tañon, an attorney, has held a career position as a member of PREPA's Auction Committee since 1997. The complaint gives no information about what the Auction Committee does. He is an active member of the New Progressive Party (\"NPP\"), which controlled the government in Puerto Rico at the time of his appointment. The 2000 elections, however, brought the Popular Democratic Party (\"PDP\") into power. The new administration in 2002 increased the size of PREPA's Auction Committee from three to five members, with the two new members being PDP adherents. PREPA officials then ceased appointing Morales-Tañon to temporary terms as acting president of the Auction Committee, appointing the new PDP committee members instead. They did this even though the two new individuals were not yet (according to Morales-Tañon) full permanent members of the committee.</p>\n<p>In January 2006, the president of the committee formally retired. At the time of the filing of this complaint, PREPA had yet to start the appointment process for a replacement president. This takes us to the crux of Morales-Tañon's complaint: that PREPA has not yet opened up the presidency position \"for no other reason than to discriminate against Plaintiff by allowing the newly appointed members of the PDP to obtain their status as permanent members of the Auction Committee and thus[ ] qualify for an appointment as President ..., all in retaliation for Plaintiff's political activities in support of the NPP.\" Plaintiff asserts that he is the only member of the committee who is currently qualified to hold the presidency. Morales-Tañon also amended his complaint to add allegations of continuing harassment and retaliation. The alleged retaliation is his receipt of a reprimand for raising his voice to a co-worker and an ethics charge for engaging in private practice outside work hours, both of which actions were taken in January 2007.</p>\n<p>Morales-Tañon brought suit in federal district court in November 2006, alleging that defendants deprived him \"of a reasonable employment promotion expectation\" in violation of his First Amendment and due process rights. He sought compensatory and punitive damages and requested that the court either order PREPA to retroactively instate him as president (a position he has never held) or to start the appointment process.</p>\n<p>Defendants moved for dismissal, arguing that Morales-Tañon had failed to state a cognizable constitutional claim under § 1983 and that many of his claims under § 1983 were also time-barred. The district court agreed. It found plaintiff's allegations regarding the 2002 change in the Auction Committee's composition barred by the statute of limitations. It ruled out the due process claim because Morales-Tañon had not identified a recognized and protected property interest of which he <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> was deprived, and it found no First Amendment-based political discrimination claim because plaintiff had not alleged any adverse employment action. As to the amended complaint, the court found the complaint had not pled any facts from which an inference could be drawn of a connection between the reprimand and ethics charge and Morales-Tañon's political affiliation. The court thus dismissed the § 1983 claims with prejudice and, declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims, dismissed those claims without prejudice.</p>\n<p>Our review of Rule 12(b)(6) dismissals is de novo. <i>Parker,</i> 514 F.3d at 95. The district court's unpublished opinion carefully and correctly analyzed plaintiff's claims; we thus keep our analysis brief.</p>\n<p>To survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, a complaint must contain factual allegations sufficient to \"raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\" <i>Bell Atl.

The Court clarified that <i>Conley</i> \"described the breadth of opportunity to prove what an adequate complaint claims, not the minimum standard of adequate pleading to govern a complaint's survival.\" <i>Bell Atl. Corp.,</i> 127 S.Ct. at 1969; <i>see also </i><i>Damon v.
