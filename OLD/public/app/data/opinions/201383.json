George Z. Singal, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                        Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n          Coffin and Campbell, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Todd A. Bussert on brief for appellant.\n     Paula D. Silsby, United States Attorney, and Margaret D.\nMcGaughey, Assistant United States Attorney (Appellate Chief), on\nbrief for appellee.\n\n\n                          December 21, 2004\n\f                Per Curiam.     This is an appeal from a sentence imposed\n\npursuant to the federal sentencing guidelines. The underlying case\n\narose out of a two-count superseding indictment that charged\n\ndefendant-appellant Juan Taveras with conspiracy to possess with\n\nintent to distribute fifty grams or more of cocaine base and a\n\ndetectable amount of heroin (count 1) and distribution of five\n\ngrams or more of cocaine base and a detectable amount of heroin\n\n(count 2).          See 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 846.                The appellant\n\neventually        entered   a   straight    plea   of   guilty     (i.e.,   a   plea\n\nunaccompanied by a plea agreement) to count 2 of the superseding\n\nindictment.1\n\n                The district court convened a sentencing hearing on\n\nSeptember 3, 2003.          It found the appellant responsible for 54.9\n\ngrams of cocaine base and 67.365 grams of heroin, aggregating\n\n1,165.4 kilograms of marijuana equivalent.                That finding yielded a\n\nbase offense level of 32.          See USSG §2D1.1.        The court subtracted\n\nthree levels for acceptance of responsibility, id. §3E1.1; placed\n\nthe appellant in criminal history category III; and constructed a\n\nguideline sentencing range of 108-135 months, see id. Ch.5, Pt.A\n\n(sentencing table).         The court proceeded to sentence the appellant\n\nto   a       118-month   incarcerative     term,   four    years   of   supervised\n\nrelease, and payment of a $100 special assessment.\n\n\n\n         1\n      The district court dismissed count 1 on the government's\nmotion.\n\n                                         -2-\n\f            In essence, the appellant assigns error in only two\n\nrespects.   First, he contests the sentencing court's drug-quantity\n\ndetermination.    Second, he advances a constitutional challenge to\n\nhis sentence based on the Supreme Court's recent decision in\n\nBlakely v. Washington, 124 S. Ct. 2531 (2004).        As we explain\n\nbelow, both assignments of error lack merit.\n\n                            Drug Quantity\n\n            Drug quantity often drives the length of a defendant's\n\nsentence in a narcotics trafficking case.      See United States v.\n\nSepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1196 (1st Cir. 1993).        For sentencing\n\npurposes, a defendant is accountable not only for drugs that were\n\nactually involved in the crime of conviction but also for what was\n\ninvolved in any \"relevant conduct.\"     See United States v. Laboy,\n\n351 F.3d 578, 582 (1st Cir. 2003); see also USSG §1B1.3.    Relevant\n\nconduct includes all acts \"'that were part of the same course of\n\nconduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction,'\n\nwhether or not charged in the indictment.\" United States v. Sklar,\n\n920 F.2d 107, 110 (1st Cir. 1990) (quoting USSG §1B1.3(a)(2)).\n\n            At sentencing, the government bears the burden of proving\n\ndrug quantity.   See United States v. Huddleston, 194 F.3d 214, 224\n\n(1st Cir. 1999).     In determining drug quantity, the sentencing\n\ncourt may accept, and act upon, any reliable evidence.    See Sklar,\n\n920 F.2d at 113.     Typically, the court makes its drug-quantity\n\ndetermination by reference to a preponderance of the evidence. See\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fUnited States v. Eirby, 262 F.3d 31, 37 (1st Cir. 2001).              Under\n\nthat standard, the amount need not be exact; \"[a]n approximation of\n\ndrug quantity will be upheld 'as long as it represents a reasoned\n\nestimate.'\"    Huddleston, 194 F.3d at 224 (quoting United States v.\n\nWebster, 54 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1995)).\n\n            The court below credited some of the testimony of Michael\n\nPushard,    the   appellant's     \"middleman,\"   who   testified    at   the\n\ndisposition    hearing   as   a   government   witness.    The     appellant\n\nconcedes that Pushard's testimony, if taken at face value, supports\n\nthe disputed drug-quantity finding.            He argues, however, that\n\nPushard was a turned accomplice, a heroin addict, an inconsistent\n\nand at times self-contradictory witness, and otherwise unreliable.\n\n            A sentencing court has considerable latitude in making\n\ncredibility determinations.        See, e.g., United States v. Sanchez,\n\n354 F.3d 70, 83 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 124 S. Ct. 2187, 2189\n\n(2004); United States v. Olivier-Diaz, 13 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.\n\n1993).     The standard of review is deferential, as an appellate\n\ncourt will set aside a sentencing court's factual findings only for\n\nclear error.      United States v. Ruiz, 905 F.2d 499, 507 (1st Cir.\n\n1990).     Under that standard, we must affirm the district court's\n\ndecision \"[s]o long as [it] is based on reasonable inferences drawn\n\nfrom adequately supported facts.\"         United States v. Santos, 357\n\nF.3d 136, 142 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f            We have reviewed the presentence investigation report,\n\nthe sentencing transcript, and other relevant materials.               Having\n\ndone so, we are not left with an impression that the sentencing\n\ncourt's drug-quantity finding is outside the realm of reason.\n\nAfter all, it is within the sentencing court's purview to credit\n\nsome portions of a witness's testimony, but not others. See, e.g.,\n\nHuddleston, 194 F.3d at 223-24 (explaining that a factfinder may\n\nreject a witness's testimony as to one matter, but accept it as to\n\nanother).   That is what the court did here with regard to Pushard's\n\ntestimony. That testimony, though suspect for the reasons cited by\n\nthe appellant, was not so farfetched as to require the court to\n\nignore it entirely.\n\n            We give credit where credit is due.              Mindful of the\n\ncircumstances, the sentencing court took care to limit its reliance\n\nupon Pushard's testimony, making findings only as to transactions\n\nproven by a preponderance of the evidence and excluding from its\n\ncalculus    those    deliveries   supported    by   weaker    or   otherwise\n\nuncorroborated testimony.         That cautious approach warrants our\n\nrespect.    Cf. United States v. Whiting, 28 F.3d 1296, 1305 (1st\n\nCir. 1994) (noting that a court must take \"special care\" in\n\napproximating       drug   quantity   but   assigning   no     error   to    a\n\n\"conservative estimate [that] left a fair margin of safety\").               We\n\ntherefore reject the appellant's attack on the sentencing court's\n\ndrug-quantity finding.\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f                               Blakely\n\n          The appellant also invites this court to set aside his\n\nsentence on the basis of the Supreme Court's decision in Blakely v.\n\nWashington, 124 S. Ct. 2531 (2004).      We refuse the invitation.\n\n          Blakely examined the constitutionality of a Washington\n\nstate sentencing scheme.     After the defendant pleaded guilty to\n\nkidnaping, the trial court imposed a sentence above the statutory\n\nmaximum based on a finding of \"deliberate cruelty.\"      Id. at 2534-\n\n35.   The Supreme Court noted that this finding was \"neither\n\nadmitted by [the defendant] nor found by a jury,\" id. at 2537, and\n\ndeclared the augmented sentence to be violative of Blakely's Sixth\n\nAmendment right to trial by jury, id. at 2538.\n\n          While the Court made clear that the federal sentencing\n\nguidelines were not before it and expressed no opinion on their\n\nvalidity, id. at 2538 n.9, the rationale of Blakely calls their\n\nconstitutionality into doubt. Indeed, the Court has recently taken\n\nthis question under advisement.     See United States v. Booker, No.\n\n04-104 (argued Oct. 4, 2004); United States v. Fanfan, No. 04-105\n\n(argued Oct. 4, 2004).     That doubt, however, does not redound to\n\nthe appellant's benefit.\n\n          In this case, the sentencing court ruled, inter alia,\n\nthat the appellant's base offense level should be increased due to\n\nits drug-quantity determination. The increase in the offense level\n\nyielded an elevated guideline sentencing range and, thus, led to a\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fmore onerous sentence.    The appellant now attempts, for the first\n\ntime, to mount a Blakely challenge. He posits, correctly, that the\n\nfact on which the upward adjustment depends — drug quantity — was\n\nneither determined by a jury nor established beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.\n\n            Leaving to one side the fact that this case involves a\n\nguilty plea, not a jury verdict, the record is crystal clear that\n\nthe appellant failed to advance this argument in the lower court.2\n\nArguably,    this   omission   constitutes   a   waiver;   if   not,   it\n\nconstitutes a forfeiture. See United States v. Morgan, 384 F.3d 1,\n\n7-8 (1st Cir. 2004) (discussing this question); see also United\n\nStates v. Rodriguez, 311 F.3d 435, 437 (1st Cir. 2002) (explicating\n\nthe different consequences of waiver and forfeiture), cert. denied,\n\n538 U.S. 937 (2003).      We need not resolve that question today.\n\nAssuming, favorably to the appellant, that the omission constitutes\n\na forfeiture, his argument fails.\n\n            Forfeited claims are reviewable only for plain error.\n\nSee Rodriguez, 311 F.3d at 437.         Plain error review is not\n\nappellant-friendly. Under that standard, the court of appeals will\n\nreverse the trial court's decision only if a defendant demonstrates\n\n\"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and\n\nwhich not only (3) affected [his] substantial rights, but also (4)\n\n\n     2\n      The fact that Blakely had not been decided at the time of\nsentencing does not excuse this default. See United States v. Del\nRosario, 388 F.3d 1, 13 n.8 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n                                  -7-\n\fseriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of\n\njudicial proceedings.\"     United States v. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56, 60\n\n(1st Cir. 2001).     We discern no plain error here.\n\n          As said, the district court sentenced the appellant on\n\nSeptember 3, 2003.    That was nine months before the Supreme Court\n\ndecided Blakely.      Circuit precedent in force at the time of\n\nsentencing, in line with the Supreme Court's decision in Apprendi\n\nv. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), provided that a drug-quantity\n\nfinding did not need to be presented to a jury or proven beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt so long as the resulting sentence did not exceed\n\nthe statutory maximum for the offense of conviction.      See, e.g.,\n\nDerman v. United States, 298 F.3d 34, 43 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,\n\n537 U.S. 1048 (2002); Eirby, 262 F.3d at 37; United States v.\n\nRobinson, 241 F.3d 115, 119 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n          Here, the offense to which the appellant pleaded carries\n\na maximum sentence of forty years.      See 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B).\n\nWhether Blakely has fatally undermined previous circuit authority\n\nis an unsettled question and, whatever the ultimate outcome, the\n\nanswer is at this moment neither clear nor obvious.     Accordingly,\n\nwe cannot hold that the district court committed plain error when\n\nit sentenced the appellant on the bases, in part, of the disputed\n\ndrug-quantity finding and the dates of the relevant conduct.     See\n\nUnited States v. Del Rosario, 388 F.3d 1, 14-15 (1st Cir. 2004);\n\n\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fUnited States v. Cordoza-Estrada, 385 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(per curiam); Morgan, 384 F.3d at 8.\n\n            We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nthe appellant's conviction and sentence are summarily affirmed.\n\nSee 1st Cir. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f",

Under\n\nthat standard, the amount need not be exact; \"[a]n approximation of\n\ndrug quantity will be upheld 'as long as it represents a reasoned\n\nestimate.'\"    Huddleston, 194 F.3d at 224 (quoting United States v.\n\nWebster, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196037\"><a href=\"/opinion/196037/united-states-v-webster/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 5 (1st Cir. 1995)).\n\n            The court below credited some of the testimony of Michael\n\nPushard,    the   appellant's     \"middleman,\"   who   testified    at   the\n\ndisposition    hearing   as   a   government   witness.    The     appellant\n\nconcedes that Pushard's testimony, if taken at face value, supports\n\nthe disputed drug-quantity finding.            He argues, however, that\n\nPushard was a turned accomplice, a heroin addict, an inconsistent\n\nand at times self-contradictory witness, and otherwise unreliable.\n\n            A sentencing court has considerable latitude in making\n\ncredibility determinations.

The standard of review is deferential, as an appellate\n\ncourt will set aside a sentencing court's factual findings only for\n\nclear error.      United States v.

Having\n\ndone so, we are not left with an impression that the sentencing\n\ncourt's drug-quantity finding is outside the realm of reason.\n\nAfter all, it is within the sentencing court's purview to credit\n\nsome portions of a witness's testimony, but not others. See, e.g.,\n\nHuddleston, 194 F.3d at 223-24 (explaining that a factfinder may\n\nreject a witness's testimony as to one matter, but accept it as to\n\nanother).   That is what the court did here with regard to Pushard's\n\ntestimony. That testimony, though suspect for the reasons cited by\n\nthe appellant, was not so farfetched as to require the court to\n\nignore it entirely.\n\n            We give credit where credit is due.              Mindful of the\n\ncircumstances, the sentencing court took care to limit its reliance\n\nupon Pushard's testimony, making findings only as to transactions\n\nproven by a preponderance of the evidence and excluding from its\n\ncalculus    those    deliveries   supported    by   weaker    or   otherwise\n\nuncorroborated testimony.         That cautious approach warrants our\n\nrespect.    Cf. United States v. Whiting, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"673817\"><a href=\"/opinion/673817/united-states-v-darryl-whiting-aka-g-god-rah-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1296</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1305 (1st\n\nCir. 1994) (noting that a court must take \"special care\" in\n\napproximating       drug   quantity   but   assigning   no     error   to    a\n\n\"conservative estimate [that] left a fair margin of safety\").               We\n\ntherefore reject the appellant's attack on the sentencing court's\n\ndrug-quantity finding.\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f                               Blakely\n\n          The appellant also invites this court to set aside his\n\nsentence on the basis of the Supreme Court's decision in Blakely v.\n\nWashington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136995\"><a href=\"/opinion/136995/blakely-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2531</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2004).      We refuse the invitation.\n\n          Blakely examined the constitutionality of a Washington\n\nstate sentencing scheme.     After the defendant pleaded guilty to\n\nkidnaping, the trial court imposed a sentence above the statutory\n\nmaximum based on a finding of \"deliberate cruelty.\"      Id. at 2534-\n\n35.   The Supreme Court noted that this finding was \"neither\n\nadmitted by [the defendant] nor found by a jury,\" id. at 2537, and\n\ndeclared the augmented sentence to be violative of Blakely's Sixth\n\nAmendment right to trial by jury, id. at 2538.\n\n          While the Court made clear that the federal sentencing\n\nguidelines were not before it and expressed no opinion on their\n\nvalidity, id. at 2538 n.9, the rationale of Blakely calls their\n\nconstitutionality into doubt. Indeed, the Court has recently taken\n\nthis question under advisement.     See United States v. Booker, No.\n\n04-104 (argued Oct. 4, 2004); United States v. Fanfan, No. 04-105\n\n(argued Oct. 4, 2004).     That doubt, however, does not redound to\n\nthe appellant's benefit.\n\n          In this case, the sentencing court ruled, inter alia,\n\nthat the appellant's base offense level should be increased due to\n\nits drug-quantity determination. The increase in the offense level\n\nyielded an elevated guideline sentencing range and, thus, led to a\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fmore onerous sentence.    The appellant now attempts, for the first\n\ntime, to mount a Blakely challenge. He posits, correctly, that the\n\nfact on which the upward adjustment depends — drug quantity — was\n\nneither determined by a jury nor established beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.\n\n            Leaving to one side the fact that this case involves a\n\nguilty plea, not a jury verdict, the record is crystal clear that\n\nthe appellant failed to advance this argument in the lower court.2\n\nArguably,    this   omission   constitutes   a   waiver;   if   not,   it\n\nconstitutes a forfeiture. See United States v. Morgan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201233\"><a href=\"/opinion/201233/united-states-v-morgan/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n7-8 (1st Cir. 2004) (discussing this question); see also United\n\nStates v. Rodriguez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200202\"><a href=\"/opinion/200202/united-states-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">311</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 437 (1st Cir. 2002) (explicating\n\nthe different consequences of waiver and forfeiture), cert. denied,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">937</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2003).      We need not resolve that question today.\n\nAssuming, favorably to the appellant, that the omission constitutes\n\na forfeiture, his argument fails.\n\n            Forfeited claims are reviewable only for plain error.\n\nSee Rodriguez, 311 F.3d at 437.         Plain error review is not\n\nappellant-friendly. Under that standard, the court of appeals will\n\nreverse the trial court's decision only if a defendant demonstrates\n\n\"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and\n\nwhich not only (3) affected [his] substantial rights, but also (4)\n\n\n     2\n      The fact that Blakely had not been decided at the time of\nsentencing does not excuse this default.

Del\nRosario, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788222\"><a href=\"/opinion/788222/united-states-v-nelson-j-del-rosario-united-states-of-america-v-pedro/\"><span class=\"volume\">388</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 13 n.8 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n                                  -7-\n\fseriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of\n\njudicial proceedings.\"     United States v.
