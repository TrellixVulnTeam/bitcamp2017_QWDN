Guzmán-Silva, Assistant Federal Public Defender,\nwith whom Joseph C. Laws, Jr., Federal Public Defender, and Juan\nF. Matos-DeJuan, Assistant Federal Public Defender, were on\nbrief, for Appellant.\n\n     Thomas F. Klumper, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom H. S. Garcia, United States Attorney, and Sonia I. Torres,\nAssistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for the\nAppellee.\n\n\n                           December 24, 2002\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f          Per Curiam. Defendant Samuel Sanchez Mota pleaded guilty\n\nto being an alien found in the United States after removal, in\n\nviolation of 8 U.S.C. § 1326(a).              The district court applied\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2L1.2(b)(1)(C) to enhance his base offense by 8 levels\n\nfor remaining in the United States after an aggravated felony\n\nconviction.    We reverse and remand for resentencing.\n\n                                 BACKGROUND\n\n          Title 8, § 1326(a) forbids an alien who was once removed\n\nfrom the country to return to the United States without special\n\npermission, and it authorizes a prison term of up to, but no more\n\nthan, two years.      Section 1326(b) authorizes a prison term of up\n\nto, but no more than, 20 years for \"any alien described\" in\n\nsubsection    (a),   if   the   initial    \"removal   was   subsequent to   a\n\nconviction for commission of an aggravated felony.\"                8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1326(b) (emphasis added).       As the government acknowledges, there\n\nis no question that the defendant is subject to § 1326(a), but is\n\nnot subject to § 1326(b).          Nevertheless, his conviction for an\n\naggravated felony—though his initial removal was precedent to the\n\nconviction—served as the basis for the district court's application\n\nof a sentencing enhancement and a term of imprisonment in excess of\n\nthe § 1326(a) limit of two years.\n\n             The facts are not in dispute.        Samuel Sanchez-Mota was\n\ndeported from the United States in 1994.         He returned and was again\n\ndeported/removed from the United States in August 1999.            Sometime\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fafter this removal, Sanchez-Mota reentered the United States.                         In\n\nApril 2000, he was convicted in Puerto Rico of an \"aggravated\n\nfelony,\" receipt of illegally appropriated goods, and sentenced to\n\ntwo years.       On an unknown date in 2001, Sanchez-Mota was released\n\nfrom custody upon the completion of his sentence.                 In July 2001, he\n\nwas arrested and charged with being an illegal alien \"found in\" the\n\nUnited   States      after    deportation,       in    violation    of       8   U.S.C.\n\n§ 1326(a).       He pleaded guilty.            His non-binding plea agreement\n\nspecified    a     U.S.S.G.    calculation      with   the    understanding          that\n\nSanchez-Mota was not an aggravated felon.                That calculation would\n\nhave provided for an adjusted offense level of 6, resulting in a\n\nguideline sentencing range of 9 to 15 months.\n\n             The    district     court    disagreed      with     the    calculation\n\npresented by the parties.         U.S.S.G. § 2L1.2(b)(1)(C) provides for\n\nan   8-level     enhancement     in   the   base      offense    level       \"[i]f    the\n\ndefendant previously was deported, or unlawfully remained in the\n\nUnited States, after . . . a conviction for an aggravated felony.\"\n\nThe district court, accepting the recommendation of the probation\n\nofficer,    concluded     that    the    guideline      for     aggravated       felons\n\napplied.     The court sentenced Sanchez-Mota in accordance with an\n\nadjusted    offense     level    of   13,   which      resulted    in    a    30-month\n\nsentence.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\f                                 DISCUSSION\n\n           We   review    the    district       court's   interpretation    and\n\napplication of the sentencing guidelines de novo and its factual\n\nfindings for clear error.        United States v. Skrodzki, 9 F.3d 198,\n\n203 (1st Cir.1993).\n\n           Although     the   language     of    the   relevant   statute   and\n\nguideline is convoluted, the question presented is simple: does a\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2L1.2(b)(1)(C) enhancement apply to Sanchez-Mota, whose\n\nremoval was precedent to his conviction for an aggravated felony?\n\nThe government argues that it does because Sanchez-Mota unlawfully\n\n\"remained\" in the United States after his conviction, i.e., his\n\ninitial   deportation    could    serve     as   the   basis   for   unlawfully\n\nremaining in the country subsequent to his conviction because 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1326(a) constitutes a continuing offense.             The government\n\nreconciles the contradiction between U.S.S.G. § 2L1.2(b)(1)(C) and\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1326(b)—a penalty provision that states that an alien's\n\nremoval must be subsequent to an aggravated felony—by asserting\n\nthat § 1326(b) doesn't apply.         According to the government, the\n\ndistrict court correctly applied the U.S.S.G. § 2L1.2(b)(1)(C)\n\nenhancement, but should have sentenced Sanchez-Mota to no more than\n\ntwo years, the statutory maximum under § 1326(a).                 Sanchez-Mota\n\nargues that U.S.S.G. § 2L1.2(b)(1)(C) does not apply to these\n\nfactual circumstances. Alternatively, he argues that the guideline\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\flanguage is ambiguous and the rule of lenity should be applied in\n\nhis favor.\n\n           Sanchez-Mota's position is more persuasive based on:\n\n(1) the plain language of U.S.S.G. § 2L1.2(b)(1)(C); and (2) the\n\nrelationship     between   U.S.S.G.    §    2L1.2(b)(1)(C)      and   8   U.S.C.\n\n§ 1326(a).\n\n1.           Plain Language of U.S.S.G. § 2L1.2(b)(1)(C)\n\n             U.S.S.G. § 2L1.2 is entitled \"Unlawfully Entering or\n\nRemaining in the United States.\"             It is the \"Remaining in the\n\nUnited States\" aspect that the government attempts to apply to\n\nSanchez-Mota.    Because § 1326(a) constitutes a continuing offense,\n\nthe government argues that the 8-level enhancement applies—even if\n\nhis removal was precedent to the conviction.                According to the\n\ngovernment, Sanchez-Mota necessarily \"remained\" in the country\n\nsubsequent to his conviction for an aggravated felony.\n\n           The   application   notes       for   U.S.S.G.   §   2L1.2(b)(1)(C)\n\nprovide:\n\n           A defendant shall be considered to have\n           unlawfully remained in the United States if\n           the defendant remained in the United States\n           following a removal order issued after a\n           conviction, regardless of whether the removal\n           order was in response to the conviction.\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2L1.2, cmt. n.1(A)(iii) (emphasis added). This language\n\nsuggests that the guideline enhancement will apply, at most, to an\n\nalien who (a) commits an aggravated felony, (b) is then subject to\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fan order of deportation or removal, and (c) doesn't depart but\n\ninstead remains in the United States unlawfully.\n\n           In contrast, Sanchez-Mota (a) was removed, (b) returned\n\nillegally, and (c) was convicted of an aggravated felony. Were the\n\ngovernment's interpretation of U.S.S.G. § 2L1.2(b)(1) adopted, it\n\nwouldn't matter whether the removal occurred precedent to or\n\nsubsequent to the conviction.         So long as the defendant had been\n\npreviously deported, he would face a sentencing enhancement if he\n\ncommitted an aggravated felony.        Thus, the government implies that\n\napplying the present guideline would have changed the result of\n\nUnited States v. Mendoza-Alvarez, 79 F.3d 96 (8th Cir. 1996).\n\n           In Mendoza-Alvarez, the defendant's initial deportation\n\noccurred in 1986 or earlier, he was convicted of a crime in 1987,\n\nand he voluntarily departed sometime after that only to return\n\nillegally.    This final time around, he pleaded guilty to illegal\n\nreentry in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1326(a), and the district court\n\nenhanced     his   base   level   for       the   offense    under   U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 2L1.2(b)(1). The government argued that this enhancement was\n\nproper   because    the   defendant     (a)   had   been    convicted   of   an\n\naggravated felony, and (b) had voluntarily departed the country and\n\nthen illegally returned.      The Eighth Circuit reversed because the\n\ngovernment had failed to offer any evidence that defendant had ever\n\nbeen deported after his conviction. Id. at 97-98. According to the\n\ngovernment's interpretation, this consideration would not matter\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\funder    U.S.S.G.    2L1.2(b)(1)(C)        because    the     defendant's       1987\n\ndeportation order meant that he was unlawfully \"remaining in the\n\nUnited States\" subsequent to any conviction.                This interpretation\n\nis unsupported and unpersuasive.\n\n2.          Relationship Between U.S.S.G. § 2L1.2(b)(1) and 8 U.S.C.\n\n            § 1326\n\n            A larger problem with the government's interpretation of\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2L1.2(b)(1) is that it allows the application of a\n\ngreater penalty according to the rationale of § 1326(b) for someone\n\nconvicted   only     of   violating    §   1326(a),    even    when    §    1326(b)\n\nexpressly doesn't apply.         We reject the argument.\n\n            The     Sentencing      Commission       added     the     unlawfully\n\n\"remaining\" provision and its explanatory notes to U.S.S.G. § 2L1.2\n\nin order to implement the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant\n\nResponsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009.\n\nIIRIRA   provided    that    the    Sentencing   Commission      was       to   \"make\n\nappropriate changes in the base offense level for offenses under\n\n. . . 8 U.S.C. 1252(e) and 1326(b)\" to reflect corresponding\n\nchanges made in statutory penalties for those offenses made by the\n\nViolent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103-\n\n322, 108 Stat. 1796.        IIRIRA § 334 (emphasis added); see U.S.S.G.,\n\nApp. C, amend. 562.       The old § 1252(e), the substance of which is\n\nnow contained in 8 U.S.C. § 1253(a), addressed penalties for\n\n\"failure    to    depart,\"    the   natural   correlative       for    unlawfully\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f\"remaining in the United States.\"       See VCCLEA § 130001; 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1253(a) (\"Penalty for failure to depart\").      That section is not\n\nat issue here.    Section 1326(b) addresses aliens whose removal was\n\nsubsequent to their convictions for aggravated felonies.             The\n\ngovernment recognizes that section 1326(b) is also not at issue\n\nhere.      The guidelines contain no discussion whatsoever about\n\napplying    the   unlawfully   \"remaining\"   language     to   defendants\n\nconvicted under § 1326(a) but not § 1326(b).            The government's\n\nsuggestion to the contrary is unsupported.\n\n            Furthermore, the base offense level for someone convicted\n\nof a violation of § 1326(a) alone is 8, which at most (for someone\n\nin the top criminal history category) would result in a sentence of\n\n24 months, i.e., the same as the statutory maximum under § 1326(a).\n\nSee U.S.S.G. § 2L1.2(a); Ch. 5, Pt. A (Sentencing Table).         If the\n\ndefendant was previously deported, or unlawfully remained in the\n\nUnited States, after a conviction for an aggravated felony, the\n\nbase level is increased by 8 levels.         At offense level 16, the\n\nmaximum sentence is 57 months, a figure that far exceeds the\n\nstatutory maximum of subsection (a), but one that falls well within\n\nthe statutory maximum of 20 years contained in subsection (b). See\n\nid.     It makes little sense for the government to suggest that\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2L1.2(b)(1)(C) would require an automatic statutory\n\nmaximum sentence of two years for all defendants similarly situated\n\n\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fto   Sanchez-Mota.1   Far   more    persuasive   is   the   defendant's\n\ncontention that the U.S.S.G. § 2L1.2(b)(1)(C) enhancement does not\n\napply to him.\n\n\n\nReversed and remanded for resentencing.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Under a straight application of the guidelines, only\ndefendants with a criminal history category of (I) would be\nsentenced to less than two years. Even then the range would be 21\nto 27 months. U.S.S.G. Ch. 5, Pt. A.\n\n                                   -9-\n\f",

In April 2000, he was convicted in Puerto Rico of an \"aggravated felony,\" receipt of illegally appropriated goods, and sentenced to two years.

The government argues that it does because Sanchez-Mota unlawfully \"remained\" in the United States <i>after</i> his conviction, i.e., his initial deportation could serve as the basis for unlawfully remaining in the country <i>subsequent</i> to his conviction because 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(a) constitutes a continuing offense. The government reconciles the contradiction between U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2(b)(1)(C) and 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(b) &#8212; a penalty provision that states that an alien's <i>removal</i> must be subsequent to an aggravated felony &#8212; by asserting that &#167; 1326(b) doesn't apply.

The district court applied U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2(b)(1)(C) to enhance his base offense by 8 levels for remaining in the United States after an aggravated felony conviction. We reverse and remand for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Title 8, &#167; 1326(a) forbids an alien who was once removed from the country to return to the United States without special permission, and it authorizes a prison term of up to, but no more than, two years. Section 1326(b) authorizes a prison term of up to, but no more than, 20 years for \"any alien described\" in subsection (a), if the initial \"removal was <i>subsequent</i> to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(b) (emphasis added). As the government acknowledges, there is no question that the defendant is subject to &#167; 1326(a), but is <i>not</i> subject to &#167; 1326(b). Nevertheless, his conviction for an aggravated felony&#8212;though his initial removal was <i>precedent</i> to the conviction &#8212; served as the basis for the district court's application of a sentencing enhancement and a term of imprisonment in excess of the &#167; 1326(a) limit of two years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts are not in dispute. Samuel Sanchez-Mota was deported from the United States in 1994. He returned and was again deported/removed from the United States in August 1999. Sometime after this removal, Sanchez-Mota reentered the United States. In April 2000, he was convicted in Puerto Rico of an \"aggravated felony,\" receipt of illegally appropriated goods, and sentenced to two years. On an unknown date in 2001, Sanchez-Mota was released from custody upon the completion of his sentence. In July 2001, he was arrested and charged with being an illegal alien \"found in\" the United States after deportation, in violation of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(a). He pleaded guilty. His non-binding plea agreement specified a U.S.S.G. calculation with the understanding that Sanchez-Mota was not an aggravated felon. That calculation would have provided for an adjusted offense level of 6, resulting in a guideline sentencing range of 9 to 15 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court disagreed with the calculation presented by the parties. U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2(b)(1)(C) provides for an 8-level enhancement in the base offense level \"[i]f the defendant previously was deported, or unlawfully remained in the United States, after ... a conviction for an aggravated felony.\" The district court, accepting the recommendation of the probation officer, concluded that the guideline for aggravated felons applied. The court sentenced Sanchez-Mota in accordance with an adjusted offense level of 13, which resulted in a 30-month sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's interpretation and application of the sentencing guidelines <i>de novo</i> and its factual findings for clear error. <i>United States v.

The government argues that it does because Sanchez-Mota unlawfully \"remained\" in the United States <i>after</i> his conviction, i.e., his initial deportation could serve as the basis for unlawfully remaining in the country <i>subsequent</i> to his conviction because 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(a) constitutes a continuing offense. The government reconciles the contradiction between U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2(b)(1)(C) and 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(b) &#8212; a penalty provision that states that an alien's <i>removal</i> must be subsequent to an aggravated felony &#8212; by asserting that &#167; 1326(b) doesn't apply. According to the government, the district court correctly applied the U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2(b)(1)(C) enhancement, but should have sentenced Sanchez-Mota to no more than two years, the statutory maximum under &#167; 1326(a). Sanchez-Mota argues that U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2(b)(1)(C) does not apply to these factual circumstances.
