Fernández (\"Fernández\"), was the sole shareholder of both\n\nthe corporation that sold the property and the corporation that\n\nbought it?; (2) if so, did Hotel Associates' failure to notify\n\nHoward Johnson of this change of ownership result in automatic\n\ntermination of the Agreement?; and (3) if the Agreement was not\n\nautomatically terminated, did Howard Johnson breach the Agreement\n\nby licensing another entity to operate a Howard Johnson hotel in\n\nthe same geographic area?\n\n                 We discuss each of these issues in turn, \"look[ing]\n\nsolely      to    the   language   used   by    the   parties    to   discern   the\n\ncontract's meaning.\" Vt. Teddy Bear Co. v. 538 Madison Realty Co.,\n\n807 N.E.2d 876, 879 (N.Y. 2004).1\n\nA.               Change of Ownership\n\n                 The Agreement requires the licensee to \"notify Howard\n\nJohnson in writing at least 30 days in advance of the occurrence of\n\nany change of ownership of the Facility.\"              Hotel Associates argues\n\nthat there was no change of ownership because Fernández was the\n\nsole       shareholder     of   both   Horizons       Hotel     Corporation,    the\n\n\n\n       1\n      By its terms, the Agreement is to be construed in accordance\nwith New York law. Agreement, § 31.\n\n                                          -3-\n\fcorporation that previously owned the property, and R.R. Isla Verde\n\nHotel Corp. (\"Isla Verde\"), the corporation that purchased the\n\nCarib Inn at a foreclosure sale.             This argument is unavailing.\n\n\"[A] corporation is a separate and distinct legal entity apart from\n\nits stockholders.\"       Hotel Esplanade, Inc. v. Herman, 197 N.Y.S.2d\n\n579, 582 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1960) (rejecting the converse argument that\n\nownership of a hotel changed where the identity of the stockholders\n\nchanged,   despite       continuity     of   the    corporate     ownership).\n\nTherefore, Isla Verde's purchase of the Carib Inn at a foreclosure\n\nsale   constituted   a    change   of   ownership,    notwithstanding          the\n\nidentity of the shareholder.\n\nB.         No Automatic Termination of Agreement\n\n           Because there was a change of ownership, section 20(a) of\n\nthe Agreement required Hotel Associates to notify Howard Johnson of\n\nthat change, which Hotel Associates undisputedly did not do.                  This\n\nfailure to give such notice, however, did not effect an automatic\n\ntermination of the Agreement.         The Agreement provides that it may\n\nbe terminated without notice in two sets of circumstances.                In one\n\nset of circumstances – including failure to give notice of a change\n\nof ownership under section 20(a) – \"Howard Johnson may, in its sole\n\ndiscretion,   immediately      terminate     this   Agreement     .   .   .    .\"\n\nAgreement, § 21(c) (emphasis added).           By contrast, in other more\n\nserious circumstances not relevant here, the \"Agreement shall\n\nautomatically and immediately terminate . . . .\"                Id. (emphasis\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fadded).   The use of the word \"automatically\" in the latter set of\n\ncircumstances but not the former indicates that only the latter set\n\nof circumstances results in automatic termination.         See Nat'l Tax\n\nInst., Inc. v. Topnotch at Stowe Resort & Spa, 388 F.3d 15, 18 (1st\n\nCir. 2004) (stating that language discrepancies between different\n\ncontract provisions \"may cast light on meaning\").         That reading is\n\nalso supported by the use of the words \"may, in its discretion\n\n. . . terminate\" in the first instance but \"shall . . . terminate\"\n\nin the second.\n\n          Based    on   those   language   differences,    we   read   the\n\nAgreement to mean that where, as here, a licensee fails to give\n\nnotice of a change of ownership, Howard Johnson may exercise its\n\ndiscretion to terminate the contract, but the contract does not\n\nterminate ex proprio vigore (\"by its own force,\" Black's Law\n\nDictionary (8th ed. 2004)). Cf. Automatic Ticket Sys., Ltd. v. New\n\nYork, 512 N.Y.S.2d 283, 284 (N.Y. App. Div. 1987) (holding that\n\nlicense agreement terminated automatically upon transfer of control\n\nof   licensee     without   licensor's     approval   where     agreement\n\n\"unambiguously\" stated that the agreement \"shall automatically\n\nterminate\" in that event). Because Howard Johnson did not exercise\n\nits discretion to terminate the Agreement, the Agreement remained\n\nin effect despite the change of ownership.       Cf. Eckel v. Francis,\n\n774 N.Y.S.2d 552, 554 (N.Y. App. Div. 2004) (holding that contract\n\nwas terminated when party exercised its discretionary right to do\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fso under the contract), leave to appeal denied, 820 N.E.2d 291\n\n(N.Y. 2004).2\n\nC.        No Breach of Territorial Protection Provision\n\n          Having    established    that    the   Agreement   did   not\n\nautomatically terminate upon the change of ownership of the Carib\n\nInn, we must decide whether Howard Johnson breached the Agreement\n\nby licensing another entity to operate a Howard Johnson hotel in\n\nthe same geographic area as Hotel Associates.           The Agreement\n\nprovides that \"in the area delineated on Schedule C attached\n\nhereto, Howard Johnson shall not License other Howard Johnson\n\nlodging facilities upon the terms and conditions set forth on\n\nSchedule C.\"    Agreement, § 30(b).     Schedule C, in turn, provides\n\nthat \"Howard Johnson shall not license, during the term of this\n\nLicense Agreement, any Howard Johnson guest lodging facilities . .\n\n. within the [protected] territory.\"      Id. at Schedule C (emphasis\n\nadded).   And, \"the term of this Agreement (the 'License Agreement\n\nTerm')\" is expressly defined as \"commenc[ing] upon the integration\n\nof the Facility into the Howard Johnson Reservation System,\" also\n\nknown as the \"Effective Date.\"    Id. at § 4.    Because the Carib Inn\n\nproperty was never integrated into the Howard Johnson Reservation\n\n\n\n     2\n      The district court concluded that the failure to give notice\neffected an automatic termination of the Agreement, and granted\nsummary judgment to Howard Johnson on that basis.      Because we\naffirm the district court's decision on another independently\nsufficient ground, the lack of automatic termination does not\naffect the outcome of this appeal.\n\n                                  -6-\n\fSystem, under the unambiguous language of the Agreement, the\n\nterritorial protection provision, which Howard Johnson allegedly\n\nbreached by licensing another company to operate a hotel in the\n\nprotected area, was not in effect at the time of the alleged\n\nbreach.3     Therefore, Howard Johnson did not breach the Agreement\n\nand is entitled to summary judgment in its favor.4\n\n                                    III.\n\n             The district court's grant of summary judgment to Howard\n\nJohnson, denial of summary judgment to Hotel Associates, and denial\n\nof   Hotel   Associates'   motion   to     alter   or   amend   judgment   are\n\naffirmed.     Costs are taxed against Hotel Associates.\n\n\n\n\n      3\n       Hotel Associates cites deposition testimony of various\nHoward Johnson officials stating that the territorial protection\nprovision of the Agreement went into effect at the time the\nAgreement was signed in 1993. However, that extrinsic evidence is\nimmaterial, given the clear and unambiguous contractual language to\nthe contrary. S. Rd. Assocs. v. IBM Corp., 826 N.E.2d 806, 809\n(N.Y. 2005).\n      4\n       Howard Johnson made this argument before the district court\n– i.e., that since Hotel Associates failed to integrate the Carib\nInn property into the Howard Johnson Reservation System, the\nterritorial protection provision never went into effect and, thus,\nthere was no breach.      The district court never reached this\nargument because it concluded that Hotel Associate's failure to\nnotify Howard Johnson of the change of ownership effected an\nautomatic termination of the Agreement.\n\n                                    -7-\n\f",

Schedule C, in turn, provides\n\nthat \"Howard Johnson shall not license, during the term of this\n\nLicense Agreement, any Howard Johnson guest lodging facilities . .\n\n. within the [protected] territory.\"      Id. at Schedule C (emphasis\n\nadded).   And, \"the term of this Agreement (the 'License Agreement\n\nTerm')\" is expressly defined as \"commenc[ing] upon the integration\n\nof the Facility into the Howard Johnson Reservation System,\" also\n\nknown as the \"Effective Date.\"    Id. at § 4.    Because the Carib Inn\n\nproperty was never integrated into the Howard Johnson Reservation\n\n\n\n     2\n      The district court concluded that the failure to give notice\neffected an automatic termination of the Agreement, and granted\nsummary judgment to Howard Johnson on that basis.      Because we\naffirm the district court's decision on another independently\nsufficient ground, the lack of automatic termination does not\naffect the outcome of this appeal.\n\n                                  -6-\n\fSystem, under the unambiguous language of the Agreement, the\n\nterritorial protection provision, which Howard Johnson allegedly\n\nbreached by licensing another company to operate a hotel in the\n\nprotected area, was not in effect at the time of the alleged\n\nbreach.3     Therefore, Howard Johnson did not breach the Agreement\n\nand is entitled to summary judgment in its favor.4\n\n                                    III.\n\n             The district court's grant of summary judgment to Howard\n\nJohnson, denial of summary judgment to Hotel Associates, and denial\n\nof   Hotel   Associates'   motion   to     alter   or   amend   judgment   are\n\naffirmed.     Costs are taxed against Hotel Associates.\n\n\n\n\n      3\n       Hotel Associates cites deposition testimony of various\nHoward Johnson officials stating that the territorial protection\nprovision of the Agreement went into effect at the time the\nAgreement was signed in 1993. However, that extrinsic evidence is\nimmaterial, given the clear and unambiguous contractual language to\nthe contrary. S. Rd. Assocs. v. IBM Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">826</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">806</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 809\n(N.Y. 2005).\n      4\n       Howard Johnson made this argument before the district court\n– i.e., that since Hotel Associates failed to integrate the Carib\nInn property into the Howard Johnson Reservation System, the\nterritorial protection provision never went into effect and, thus,\nthere was no breach.      The district court never reached this\nargument because it concluded that Hotel Associate's failure to\nnotify Howard Johnson of the change of ownership effected an\nautomatic termination of the Agreement.\n\n                                    -7-\n\f</pre>",
