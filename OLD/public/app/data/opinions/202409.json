R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                         For the First Circuit\n\n\nNo. 04-2543\n\n                               UNITED STATES,\n\n                                  Appellee,\n\n                                       v.\n\n                               MICHAEL WELLS,\n\n                          Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n              [Hon. Mark L. Wolf, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                    Before\n\n                       Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                     Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                      and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Dana A. Curhan and Roger Witkin on brief for appellant.\n     Jennifer Hay Zacks, Assistant United States Attorney, and\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                            September 13, 2006\n\f             Per Curiam. In June 2004, a jury convicted Michael Wells\n\nof conspiracy and importation of a controlled substance. Wells had\n\norchestrated a scheme wherein he recruited women to fly from\n\nMassachusetts to Jamaica, ingest pellets of cocaine, and then\n\nreturn to the United States and expel the pellets for Wells to\n\nsell.   The district court sentenced Wells to a term of 169 months\n\nin prison, to be followed by 96 months of supervised release.                              In\n\ncalculating this sentence, the court applied two enhancements to\n\nWells's     offense    level:    a    two-level         enhancement     under       USSG    §\n\n2D1.1(b)(1) for possession of a dangerous weapon and a four-level\n\nenhancement under § 3B1.1(a) for being the organizer or leader of\n\na criminal activity that involved at least five people or was\n\notherwise    extensive.         In    this    appeal,      Wells     argues    that    the\n\ndistrict court erred in applying these two enhancements.\n\n             The    district         court     applied        the     dangerous-weapon\n\nenhancement based on the testimony of two women whom Wells had sent\n\nto Jamaica to procure cocaine.               The women testified that, while in\n\nWells's apartment, they had seen Wells remove a handgun from his\n\npants and place it under a plant, near the refrigerator where Wells\n\nstored cocaine.       One of the women asked Wells why he had the gun,\n\nand he responded that it was for his protection.                     At the sentencing\n\nhearing, Wells protested that the gun could have been a replica,\n\nbut   the   court     declared       itself       satisfied    that    the    two    women\n\ncorrectly    identified     the       gun    as    an   actual      weapon.     It    also\n\n\n                                            -2-\n\fconcluded that Wells possessed the weapon in connection with the\n\noffense conduct, that is, the cocaine conspiracy.\n\n            This court reviews factual findings supporting a district\n\ncourt's imposition of a sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines\n\nfor clear error.     United States v. Meada, 408 F.3d 14, 24 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).    We find no such error in the district court's conclusion\n\nthat Wells possessed a functioning firearm rather than a replica.\n\nThe court explicitly stated that it found the two women to be\n\ngenerally credible witnesses.          The mere factual possibility that\n\nthe gun Wells concealed in the plant was a replica does not render\n\nthe   court's    finding   clearly    erroneous,   especially   since   that\n\nfinding need be supported by only a preponderance of the evidence.\n\nSee United States v. Holliday, 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 19431 (1st Cir.\n\nAug. 2, 2006).     Wells also contends that the firearm, even if real,\n\nwas not sufficiently connected with his criminal offense to warrant\n\napplication of the two-level enhancement.          Application Note 3 to §\n\n2D1.1 indicates that the dangerous-weapon enhancement should be\n\napplied \"if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable\n\nthat the weapon was connected with the offense.\"          § 2D1.1 cmt. n.3.\n\nThis means that the defendant must have \"possessed the weapon\n\nduring    the   currency   of   the   offense,   not   necessarily   that   he\n\nactually used it in perpetrating the crime or that he intended to\n\ndo so.\"   United States v. McDonald, 121 F.3d 7, 10 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\nHere, Wells kept a handgun in his apartment, hidden in a plant pot\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fvery near to his stash of cocaine, and he told his co-conspirators\n\nthat the weapon was for his protection.              The district court did not\n\nclearly err in deeming the dangerous-weapon enhancement applicable.\n\n           Wells also challenges the district court's application of\n\na four-level enhancement under § 3B1.1(a), which calls for such an\n\nincrease \"if the defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal\n\nactivity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise\n\nextensive.\"     On appeal, Wells argues that the enhancement is\n\ninappropriate because the relevant criminal activity involved only\n\nfour people.    Before the district court, however, Wells did not\n\nraise this argument.        We therefore review the objection for plain\n\nerror.   United States v. Connolly, 341 F.3d 16, 31 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\nOur review of the facts leaves little doubt that the cocaine\n\nimportation scheme involved at least five people: Wells himself;\n\nthe two women who served as smugglers, Leeann Leanna and Jennifer\n\nChicklis; a woman named Pauletta who picked up Leanna and Chicklis\n\nin Jamaica and provided them with cocaine; and an unnamed man who\n\ndrove Leanna to the airport in Boston so she could fly to Jamaica.\n\nThe district court also found the cocaine conspiracy \"otherwise\n\nextensive\"    since   it    involved    the     international     smuggling     of\n\ncontraband.     We    see   no   error,      plain    or   otherwise,   in   these\n\nconclusions.\n\n           The defendant's sentence is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\f",
