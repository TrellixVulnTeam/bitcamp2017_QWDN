Mark Terison, Senior Litigation Counsel, with whom Paula D.\nSilsby, United States Attorney, was on brief, for appellant/cross-\nappellee.\n     John Paul DeGrinney, with whom DeGrinney Law Offices was on\nbrief, for appellee/cross-appellant.\n     William S.

On    October     16,     1996,   John\n\nFrechette was convicted in state court in Lewiston, Maine, after\n\npleading no contest to a charge that he had assaulted his then\n\nlive-in girlfriend.      This offense was a misdemeanor, see Me. Rev.\n\nStat. Ann. tit. 17-A, § 207, and          Frechette was sentenced to a jail\n\nterm of thirty days, which was immediately suspended, and to a one-\n\nyear term of probation.\n\n           In     1996   Congress   passed,       as   part    of     the   Omnibus\n\nConsolidated Appropriations Act of 1997, the Lautenberg Amendment\n\nto the Gun Control Act of 1968 (\"the Amendment\"), Pub. L. No. 104-\n\n208, § 658, 110 Stat. 3009, 3009-371           to -372 (1996) (codified as\n\namended at 18 U.S.C. §§ 921, 922, 925).                 See United States v.\n\nHartsock, 347 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 2003).                    The Amendment was\n\nintended, in part, to address the growing national recognition of\n\nthe importance of deterring domestic violence.                      See id. at 5\n\n(citing   sources).       It    expressed    Congress's       recognition      that\n\nfirearms were frequently used in domestic violence attacks.                     See\n\nid.\n\n           Congress also recognized that there was a loophole in the\n\nlaw, which it moved to close.       Although earlier law had restricted\n\nthe possession of firearms by those convicted of domestic violence\n\nfelonies, no such restrictions existed as to possession of firearms\n\nby persons convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors.                     See id.\n\nThe   Amendment    eliminated     this     disparity.         Under    18    U.S.C.\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f§ 922(g)(9), it is now unlawful for a person \"who has been\n\nconvicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\"\n\nto, inter alia, \"possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or\n\nammunition.\"   The statute defines \"misdemeanor crime of domestic\n\nviolence\" as an offense that:\n\n          (i) is a misdemeanor under Federal, State, or\n          Tribal law; and\n\n          (ii) has, as an element, the use or attempted\n          use of physical force, or the threatened use\n          of a deadly weapon, committed by a current or\n          former spouse, parent, or guardian of the\n          victim, by a person with whom the victim\n          shares a child in common, by a person who is\n          cohabiting with or has cohabited with the\n          victim as a spouse, parent, or guardian, or by\n          a person similarly situated to a spouse,\n          parent, or guardian of the victim.\n\n18 U.S.C. §    921(a)(33)(A).   This provision is subject to some\n\naffirmative defenses, two of which are described below and are\n\ninvolved in this appeal.\n\n          On February 9, 2005, a federal grand jury returned a\n\nsuperseding indictment charging Frechette with having \"knowingly\n\npossessed in and affecting commerce a firearm, specifically a\n\nPhoenix Arms, .22 caliber pistol,\" in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 922(g)(9) and 924(a).1       There seems to   be little dispute\n\nFrechette had a firearm; his main defense was that his misdemeanor\n\n\n\n\n     1\n          18 U.S.C. § 924(a) sets out the penalties for, inter\nalia, the knowing violation of § 922(g).\n\n                                 -3-\n\fdomestic violence conviction did not count as a predicate offense\n\nwithin the meaning of the statute.\n\n             Frechette did not argue that his 1996 Maine offense was\n\nnot a \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence,\" as defined at 18\n\nU.S.C.   §   921(a)(33)(A).    Instead,   he   moved   to   dismiss   the\n\nindictment on the basis that the 1996 offense did not count as a\n\n\"conviction\" within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(33)(B)(i)(I)\n\nand (II), because it was secured without his having \"knowingly and\n\nintelligently waived [both] the right to counsel,\" 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 921(a)(33)(B)(i)(I), and \"the right to have the case tried by a\n\njury,\" id. § 921(a)(33)(B)(i)(II).\n\n             The text of the affirmative defenses Frechette invoked\n\nprovides:\n\n             (i) A person shall not be considered to have\n             been convicted of [a misdemeanor crime of\n             domestic violence] for purposes of this\n             chapter, unless --\n\n                    (I) the person was represented by\n                    counsel in the case, or knowingly and\n                    intelligently waived the right to\n                    counsel in the case; and\n\n                    (II) in the case of a prosecution for\n                    an offense described in this paragraph\n                    for which a person was entitled to a\n                    jury trial in the jurisdiction in which\n                    the case was tried, either\n\n                         (aa) the case was tried by a jury,\n                         or\n\n                         (bb) the person knowingly and\n                         intelligently waived the right to\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\f                          have the case tried by a jury, by\n                          guilty plea or otherwise.\n\nId. § 921(a)(33)(B)(i).\n\n          The statute also sets forth another affirmative defense,\n\nwhich is set out just below those already described.            See id.\n\n§ 921(a)(33)(B)(ii).      That defense is not at issue here, but is\n\npertinent to understanding the provisions that are at issue:\n\n          (ii) A person shall not be considered to have\n          been convicted of such an offense for purposes\n          of this chapter if the conviction has been\n          expunged or set aside, or is an offense for\n          which the person has been pardoned or has had\n          civil rights restored (if the law of the\n          applicable jurisdiction provides for the loss\n          of civil rights under such an offense) unless\n          the pardon, expungement, or restoration of\n          civil rights expressly provides that the\n          person may not ship, transport, possess, or\n          receive firearms.\n\nId.\n\n          In   response    to   Frechette's   motion   to   dismiss   the\n\nindictment, the government entered into evidence a transcript of\n\nFrechette's October 16, 1996 state-court appearance on the assault\n\ncharge.   The transcript showed that the state court conducted a\n\n\"mass arraignment,\" in which it brought a large group of defendants\n\ninto the courtroom and advised them collectively about their\n\nrights. Frechette does not dispute that he was among that group of\n\ndefendants.\n\n          Among other things, the court informed Frechette and the\n\nothers that they had the right to a jury trial:\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f          Now here are your rights. Since you're here\n          on a criminal charge, I want to advise you,\n          first and foremost, that you're all presumed\n          innocent until proven guilty.       Under our\n          system of justice, and the state and federal\n          constitution[s], you are entitled to a trial\n          by judge or jury. You are entitled to have\n          the State, and by the State, I mean the law\n          enforcement agency that has arrested you and\n          charged you with a crime, to come to court and\n          prove their case to a judge or jury. . . .\n\n          The court also informed the group of defendants that each\n\nof them had the right to counsel:\n\n          The third right and the last right that I want\n          to explain to everybody is your right to an\n          attorney. If any of you are here and there is\n          a probability or a possibility that you could\n          be facing jail if you are convicted of the\n          crime that you are being charged with here, I\n          would advise you to get a lawyer or get legal\n          advice. Also, if you can't afford a lawyer,\n          depending on your financial circumstances, you\n          can ask me to appoint a lawyer at the State\n          expense for you.    Here's how that happens.\n          You let me know. I'm obviously going to let\n          you know how serious the offense is and you\n          are going to be asked about whether you are\n          going to represent yourself, hire a lawyer, or\n          ask for a court appointed lawyer. If you ask\n          for a court appointed lawyer, you're gonna be\n          screened this morning by a financial screening\n          officer who will interview you and decide\n          whether you meet the guidelines for a court\n          appointed lawyer. If you meet the guidelines,\n          a lawyer will be appointed who practices\n          within our jurisdiction here. . . . If you\n          don't qualify, that means you will have to\n          hire your own lawyer or represent yourself.\n          Please understand the case doesn't go away\n          because you don't get a court appointed\n          lawyer.     You still have to face the\n          charges. . . .\n\n\n\n\n                               -6-\n\f            Finally, the court explained to the group that each\n\ndefendant could enter one of three pleas, and that each would waive\n\nthe rights to a trial and to counsel by pleading \"guilty\" or \"no\n\ncontest\":\n\n            I am going ask you to enter one of three\n            pleas: Guilty, Not Guilty, No Contest. Guilty\n            means what it says. It means that you will end\n            up saying \"I'm Guilty\" - you admit the charge\n            and we will impose a sentence this morning.\n            If you plead Not Guilty, you are asking for a\n            trial and I will give you a date for your\n            trial.   If you plead No Contest that means\n            that you don't want to plead Guilty, but you\n            don't want a trial and you want to dispose of\n            the matter and you want to get rid of it\n            today. There is still a conviction. In other\n            words, I make a finding of guilt. The only\n            difference is that you haven't pled guilty,\n            you're still convicted without a trial. Those\n            of you who plead Guilty and those of you who\n            plead No Contest waive your right to a trial.\n            Obviously, you're not going to have a trial.\n            You waive your right also to get the advice of\n            a   lawyer,   so   please   understand   those\n            consequences before you decide to plead\n            Guilty. . . .\n\n            . . . .\n\n            Now if you plead Not Guilty you'll get a date\n            for trial - I told you that. Then we're going\n            to hand you three pieces of paper . . . .\n            Page One is your ticket to a jury trial. Since\n            it's a criminal offense, you have a right to\n            say, \"I want a jury trial instead of a judge\n            trial.\" The reason you're in district court\n            is because all of you are here on Class D and\n            E crimes. . . . If you want a jury trial, you\n            take the first piece of paper that is handed\n            to you this morning and within three weeks of\n            today's date, sign it and bring it to the\n            clerk in the lobby. . . . If that happens,\n            your case is transferred across the river and\n            goes to the Superior Court in Auburn and\n\n                                 -7-\n\f            you'll be notified by that court of the time\n            and date of your trial by jury. If you don't\n            file it within three weeks, you have to be\n            here on the day I give you for a trial before\n            a judge in this court.\n\n            Following the mass arraignment, the court engaged in an\n\nindividual plea colloquy with Frechette.        The court observed that\n\nFrechette    had   already   pleaded    \"not   guilty\"   at   his    initial\n\nappearance in state court and that he was presently before the\n\ncourt on a bench warrant for not showing up for trial.2             The court\n\nadvised Frechette that he \"ha[d] a right to either ask for a new\n\ncourt date if you want to do so,\" at which point Frechette seems to\n\nhave interrupted and said \"no.\"        Frechette then indicated that he\n\nwanted to change his plea to \"no contest,\" and the court warned him\n\nthat by so doing, he would be waiving his \"right to trial.\"              The\n\ncourt did not, however, as it had done earlier at the mass\n\narraignment, invoke the phrase \"jury trial\":\n\n            Court:   All right, Mr. Frechette, you have\n            already pled Not Guilty.   This was a bench\n            warrant for not showing up to your trial and\n\n\n\n     2\n          There is some confusion in the record about what happened\nat Frechette's initial arraignment, which took place on December\n13, 1995. According to the state court docket, Frechette pleaded\nguilty on December 13 and the case was continued for sentencing to\nNovember 7, 1996.     However, the docket also indicates that a\nhearing notice was issued to Frechette on September 3, 1996,\napparently ordering him to appear in court on October 3, 1996. He\nfailed to appear on that date, and a bench warrant was issued for\nhis arrest. He was then arrested on October 4 and brought into\ncourt on October 16, whereupon the court stated, and Frechette did\nnot deny, that he had actually pleaded \"not guilty\" at the December\n13 arraignment.\n\n                                   -8-\n\f          you have a right to either ask for a new court\n          date if you want to do so.\n\n          Frechette:   No.\n\n          Court:   Do you want to change your plea?\n\n          Frechette:   No contest.\n\n          Court: Do you want to change your plea to No\n          Contest? Do you understand by doing that you\n          waive your right to trial. Right?\n\n          Frechette:   Yes.\n\n          In the course of the colloquy, the court also noted that\n\nFrechette did not qualify financially for a court-appointed lawyer.\n\nIt informed Frechette that by pleading \"no contest,\" he would be\n\nwaiving his right to counsel:\n\n          Court: Your right to the advice of a lawyer?\n          Does he get a court appointed lawyer? No, he\n          didn't qualify. Okay. Do you understand that\n          by pleading [\"no contest\"] that you waive your\n          right to trial and the advice of a lawyer?\n          All right?\n\n          Frechette:   Yup.\n\n          Court: Okay. Do you want to have him waived,\n          please?\n\n          Court Officer:   This is a waiver of counsel\n          I'm going to read to you[:]\n\n                   \"I am the person charged in this\n                   proceeding. I am fully aware of my\n                   right to have my attorney of my own\n                   choosing or, if I am unable to afford\n                   an attorney, to have an attorney\n                   appointed by the court at public\n                   expense. I do not desire an attorney\n                   and hereby waive my right to be\n                   represented by an attorney.\"\n\n\n                                -9-\n\f            Do you understand what I read to you, sir?\n            Having read that to you, you can sign right\n            here, please.\n\nFrechette does not dispute that he signed the waiver after this\n\nexchange.\n\n            Frechette conceded that the transcript provided by the\n\ngovernment was \"[a]n accurate transcript of the plea colloquy and\n\nadvisement of rights for the predicate offense.\"3 Nevertheless, as\n\npart of his motion to dismiss the indictment, he requested an\n\nevidentiary hearing, at which he sought to present evidence, inter\n\nalia, of his educational background and lack of sophistication\n\nabout the criminal justice system, the underlying facts of his\n\npredicate domestic violence offense, his lack of recall about being\n\nnotified by the state court of his rights to counsel and to a jury\n\ntrial, and his financial circumstances at the time of his \"no\n\ncontest\" plea, which allegedly precluded him from securing paid\n\ncounsel.     The magistrate judge, without ruling on Frechette's\n\nmotion to dismiss the indictment, rejected his motion for an\n\nevidentiary hearing in a memorandum decision, to which Frechette\n\ntimely objected.\n\n            The   district   court    subsequently   allowed   for   oral\n\nargument, both on the magistrate judge's order denying Frechette an\n\n\n\n     3\n           Frechette initially challenged the accuracy of the\ntranscript.    But he made clear to the district court at oral\nargument on his motion to dismiss that he was withdrawing his\nobjection.\n\n                                     -10-\n\fevidentiary hearing and on Frechette's motion to dismiss the\n\nindictment.    In an opinion issued on June 10, 2005, the district\n\ncourt overruled Frechette's objection to the magistrate judge's\n\norder denying him an evidentiary hearing, but allowed his motion to\n\ndismiss.   See United States v. Frechette, 372 F. Supp. 2d 669, 676\n\n(D. Me. 2005). The court entered a judgment of discharge, pursuant\n\nto Rule 32(k)(1) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, on\n\nJune 13, 2005.\n\n           In its June 10 opinion, the district court held: (1) that\n\nthe question of whether Frechette \"knowingly and intelligently\n\nwaived the right to have the case tried by a jury, by guilty plea\n\nor otherwise\" under 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(33)(B)(i)(II)(bb), was to be\n\ndetermined by the law of the state of the predicate conviction and\n\nnot by federal law, see Frechette, 372 F. Supp. 2d at 674; (2) that\n\nif federal constitutional law were the appropriate standard, then\n\nthe waiver of jury trial would be valid, see id. at 675, but that\n\nunder the law of Maine, specifically State v. Rowell, 468 A.2d 1005\n\n(Me. 1983), the waiver was invalid, see Frechette, 372 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 675; (3) that Frechette was not entitled to an evidentiary\n\nhearing, see id. at 673; and (4) that Frechette had not shown that\n\nhis waiver of counsel in the predicate state proceeding was invalid\n\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(33)(B)(i)(I), see Frechette, 372 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 673.    Each side appeals from the issue(s) it lost.\n\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\f              The key question on appeal is whether the jury waiver\n\nquestion is determined by reference to state law standards or to\n\nthe federal constitutional standard for waiver.              We review this\n\nquestion of statutory interpretation de novo.               United States v.\n\nRosa-Ortiz, 348 F.3d 33, 36 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n              We hold that the validity of a waiver of jury trial for\n\npurposes of 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(33)(B)(i)(II)(bb) is to be evaluated\n\nunder   the    federal   constitutional     standard   and   that   Frechette\n\nvalidly waived that right.        We also hold that the district court\n\nwas correct to conclude that Frechette was not entitled to an\n\nevidentiary hearing and that Frechette validly waived his right to\n\ncounsel.      As a result, we reverse the district court solely on the\n\nquestion of whether Frechette validly waived his right to a jury\n\ntrial, vacate the order of dismissal, and remand for proceedings\n\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n                                     I.\n\n                  Interpretation of Statutory Provision\n                      Regarding Waiver of Jury Trial\n\n              Our task is to interpret the federal statute. A bit more\n\nprecision is in order.       The statute does define the standard for\n\nthe waiver of the jury trial right: the standard is whether the\n\nperson \"knowingly and intelligently\" waived the right to trial by\n\njury.      The    question   is   whether    the   phrase    \"knowingly   and\n\nintelligently\" is to be measured by federal or state standards.\n\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\f               The question becomes meaningful in situations in which\n\nthe standards turn out to be different.       We can think of at least\n\ntwo such situations.      The first is when the federal constitutional\n\nstandard has been met, but state law, applying a more defendant-\n\nfriendly standard of \"knowingly and intelligently,\" has not been\n\nmet.       The district court thought that was the situation here.4\n\n               The second (at least hypothetical) situation is one in\n\nwhich the federal constitutional standard has not been met, but a\n\nless defendant-friendly state standard for waiver has been met.\n\nState law, after all, may give a defendant a right to a jury trial\n\nwhere one is not mandated by the Sixth Amendment, see Duncan v.\n\nLouisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 159-61 (1968) (drawing a distinction\n\nbetween \"serious crimes\" and \"petty offenses,\" and holding that the\n\nSixth Amendment entitles defendants to a jury trial only for\n\nserious crimes); see also Baldwin v. New York, 399 U.S. 66, 69\n\n(1970) (holding that \"no offense can be deemed 'petty' for purposes\n\nof the right to trial by jury where imprisonment for more than six\n\nmonths is authorized\"), and where a state has chosen to do so, it\n\nis conceivable that it might allow a defendant to waive the right\n\nby some procedure that is less stringent than that required under\n\n\n\n       4\n          Because we hold that the federal constitutional standard,\nand not state standards, applies, it is unnecessary for us to\nexamine whether, as the government argues, the district court erred\nin construing Maine law, as articulated in Rowell, as providing a\nstandard more favorable to defendants than that provided by the\nfederal Constitution.\n\n                                   -13-\n\ffederal law for waiving a constitutional right to a jury trial for\n\nserious crimes.5\n\n           Frechette's argument would have this court apply state\n\nlaw standards for what constitutes \"knowing[] and intelligent[]\"\n\nwaiver, regardless of whether the particular state law being\n\ninvoked affords greater or lesser protection to defendants than\n\nwould the federal constitutional standard.          Under his theory,\n\nCongress would have to have intended for there not to be one\n\nnational standard for \"knowing[] and intelligent[]\" waiver, but a\n\nlarge number of state-created standards, some of which may be more\n\ndefendant-friendly and others of which may be more defendant-\n\nhostile.\n\n           The government's position is that the statute requires\n\nthe application of a uniform federal standard.           Use of normal\n\nprinciples   of    statutory   interpretation   favors   this   reading,\n\nalthough the text is not so clear as to eliminate all questions.\n\nFurthermore, Frechette argues that the because the statute does at\n\n\n\n     5\n          We make no comment as to the legality of such a practice.\nWe note only that at least one state has argued before its state\nsupreme court that this practice would be permissible under the\nfederal Constitution. See Mills v. Municipal Court, 515 P.2d 273,\n2810 n.8 (Cal. 1973) (en banc) (noting the government's argument\n\"that the trial record need only show that a defendant was aware\nof, and voluntarily and knowingly waived, his right to jury trial\nin those misdemeanor proceedings which are 'non-petty' under\nfederal standards\"; opining that \"this contention may accurately\nreflect the demands of the federal Constitution\"; but rejecting the\ngovernment's position \"pursuant to our supervisory authority over\nstate criminal procedures\").\n\n                                  -14-\n\ftimes incorporate state standards, national uniformity in the\n\nfederal statutory scheme to control domestic violence is not the\n\nconsistent guiding principle throughout the statute.                Still, we\n\nagree with the government.\n\n           First, when a federal statutory term such as \"knowingly\n\nand   intelligently\"      is   used,    ordinarily   the   interpretation   is\n\nsupplied   by   federal    law,   not    state   law,   absent   some   express\n\nlanguage to the contrary.         See Jerome v. United States, 318 U.S.\n\n101, 104 (1943) (\"[W]e must generally assume, in the absence of a\n\nplain indication to the contrary, that Congress when it enacts a\n\nstatute is not making the application of the federal act dependent\n\non state law.\"); see also Dickerson v. New Banner Inst., Inc., 460\n\nU.S. 103, 119-20 (1983) (noting that \"'in the absence of a plain\n\nindication to the contrary, . . . it is to be assumed when Congress\n\nenacts a statute that it does not intend to make its application\n\ndependent on state law[,]'\" because \"the application of federal\n\nlegislation is nationwide and at times the federal program would be\n\nimpaired if state law were to control\" (quoting NLRB v. Natural Gas\n\nUtil. Dist., 402 U.S. 600, 603 (1971))), superseded by statute,\n\nFirearm Owners' Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 99-308, 100 Stat. 449\n\n(1986), as recognized in Molina v. INS, 981 F.2d 14, 22 (1st Cir.\n\n1992); United States v. Ayala-Gomez, 255 F.3d 1314, 1319 (11th Cir.\n\n2001) (per curiam) (\"Words in federal statutes reflect federal\n\n\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\funderstandings, absent an explicit statement to the contrary, even\n\nif a state uses the word differently.\").\n\n              Second, the very phrase \"knowingly and intelligently\" can\n\neasily   be    read    as   a   shorthand    encapsulation   of   the   federal\n\nconstitutional standard.          See, e.g., Patton v. United States, 281\n\nU.S. 276, 312 (1930) (\"Not only must the right of the accused to a\n\ntrial by a constitutional jury be jealously preserved, but the\n\nmaintenance of the jury as a fact-finding body in criminal cases is\n\nof such importance and has such a place in our traditions, that,\n\nbefore any waiver can become effective, the consent of government\n\ncounsel and the sanction of the court must be had, in addition to\n\nthe express and intelligent consent of the defendant.\"), abrogated\n\non other grounds by Williams v. Florida, 399 U.S. 78 (1970); accord\n\nUnited States v. Leja, 448 F.3d 86, 96 (1st Cir. 2006) (upholding\n\nvalidity of jury trial waiver, so long as it was \"knowingly,\n\nvoluntarily, and intelligently\" made); cf. Edwards v. Arizona, 451\n\nU.S. 477, 482 (1981) (noting that \"waivers of counsel must not only\n\nbe voluntary, but must also constitute a knowing and intelligent\n\nrelinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege\");\n\nBoykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238, 242 (1969) (requiring that a plea\n\nbe \"intelligent and voluntary\"); Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458,\n\n464 (1938).\n\n              Third,   the      structure    of   the   statute   favors    the\n\ngovernment's construction that the jury waiver question is to be\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fanalyzed   under   the    federal      constitutional     standard.       The\n\naffirmative defense under discussion has two subsections, (I) and\n\n(II):\n\n           (i) A person shall not be considered to have\n           been convicted of [a misdemeanor crime of\n           domestic violence] for purposes of this\n           chapter unless --\n\n                   (I) the person was represented by counsel\n                   in   the    case,   or    knowingly   and\n                   intelligently waived the right to counsel\n                   in the case; and\n\n                   (II) in the case of a prosecution for an\n                   offense described in this paragraph for\n                   which a person was entitled to a jury\n                   trial in the jurisdiction in which the\n                   case was tried, either\n\n                          (aa) the case was tried by a jury, or\n\n                          (bb)   the   person  knowingly and\n                          intelligently waived the right to\n                          have the case tried by a jury, by\n                          guilty plea or otherwise.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(33)(B)(i). The parties agree that in subsection\n\n(I), which deals with the right to counsel, the term \"knowingly and\n\nintelligently   waived\"     is   to    be    analyzed   under   the   federal\n\nconstitutional standard. Only in subsection (II), which deals with\n\nthe jury trial right, does Frechette argue that the very same term\n\nis to be analyzed under state law.            There are two prongs to his\n\nargument. First, he points out that subsection (II) refers to \"the\n\njurisdiction in which the case was tried\" to determine whether\n\nthere was any jury trial right at all.          Second, he notes that the\n\nsecond affirmative defense to 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(9), set out in the\n\n                                      -17-\n\fparagraph      immediately   below    the   affirmative   defense    under\n\ndiscussion, excludes as predicate convictions those offenses for\n\nwhich the person \"has had civil rights restored (if the law of the\n\napplicable jurisdiction provides for the loss of civil rights under\n\n[such   an]    offense).\"    18   U.S.C.    §   921(a)(33)(B)(ii).     The\n\nreasoning, propounded by Frechette and employed by the district\n\ncourt, is that if Congress explicitly referred to the law of the\n\njurisdiction in which the offense was committed to determine\n\nwhether there is a jury trial right at all and to determine whether\n\nthere is a loss of civil rights for a certain offense, Congress\n\nimplicitly meant all issues concerning the right to a jury trial,\n\nincluding waiver, to be resolved by looking to state standards. On\n\nbalance, we think this approach is wrong.\n\n              On its face, the separate restoration of civil rights\n\nprovision itself has nothing to do with the right to a jury trial.\n\n              That Congress referred to state law to define whether\n\nthere was any jury trial right at all has an independent rationale.\n\nAs noted earlier, states may provide jury trials even when they are\n\nnot compelled by the federal Constitution to do so.         It is easier\n\nto administer the federal statute by simply accepting the states'\n\nchoice to give or not to give a jury trial; that is a background\n\nfact against which the whole provision operates.\n\n              But, as this case demonstrates, it is not easier to\n\nadminister the federal statute by then looking to state law to\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\fdetermine what is meant by a \"knowing[] and intelligent[]\" waiver\n\nof the right to a jury trial.6     A single, well-understood federal\n\nstandard for waiver of jury trial is clearly easier for federal\n\ncourts to apply than would be a patchwork of conflicting and\n\nchanging state laws.   See Jerome, 318 U.S. at 104 (noting \"the\n\ndesirability of uniformity in application\" of federal criminal\n\nlaws); cf. Dickerson, 460 U.S. at 111-12 (holding that \"[w]hether\n\none has been 'convicted' within the language of the gun control\n\nstatutes is necessarily . . . a question of federal, not state,\n\nlaw, despite the fact that the predicate offense and its punishment\n\nare defined by the law of the [s]tate\").\n\n          In the statute, both references to state law (in relation\n\nto whether a jury is available and to whether there is a loss of\n\ncivil rights) are isolated structurally and grammatically from the\n\nsubsection,   §   921(a)(33)(B)(i)(II)(bb),    setting   forth   the\n\nrequirement of a \"knowing[] and intelligent[] waive[r]\" of the jury\n\ntrial right. It is tempting to credit this arrangement as evidence\n\nthat Congress knew how to direct attention to state law standards\n\nwhen it so desired and that it purposefully did not do so as to\n\nwaiver of the jury trial right.7    See Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co.,\n\n\n\n     6\n          Both parties contended at oral argument that Maine law\nclearly favors their respective positions.\n     7\n          Despite the government's extensive use of legislative\nhistory to support its position, we see no need to go down this\nroad to resolve the issue.\n\n                                 -19-\n\f534 U.S. 438, 452 (2002) (\"[I]t is a general principle of statutory\n\nconstruction that when 'Congress includes particular language in\n\none section of a statute but omits it in another section of the\n\nsame Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally\n\nand purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.'\"              (quoting\n\nRussello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983))).\n\n            The text, while not entirely plain, is more consistent\n\nwith   an   intent    by   Congress    that    the    term     \"knowingly   and\n\nintelligently\"   be    interpreted      by    the    federal    constitutional\n\nstandard, and not by state standards.           We have already mentioned\n\nthat federal statutes are usually defined by federal law, that\n\nthere is no express reference to state law in this particular\n\nprovision where one might otherwise expect one, and that the\n\nstatute is more easily and better administered by use of one\n\nstandard -- and a familiar one at that.             The view that state law\n\ngoverns the content of \"knowing[] and intelligent[] waive[r]\" of\n\nthe jury trial right also, as we have described, raises the risk of\n\nlowering protections for defendants in situations in which state\n\nlaw standards for waiver are more relaxed than those set forth by\n\nthe federal constitutional standard.          That is all the more reason\n\nto give the statute its most natural reading, that the \"knowing[]\n\nand intelligent[]\" standard is to be determined by the federal\n\nconstitutional standard.      This appears to be the practice of other\n\ncircuits.    See United States v. Bethurum, 343 F.3d 712, 718 (5th\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\fCir. 2003) (applying, without discussion, federal constitutional\n\nstandard to the question of whether a jury trial waiver was\n\n\"knowing[] and intelligent[]\" within the meaning of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 921(a)(33)(B)(i)(II)(bb)); United States v. Jennings, 323 F.3d\n\n263, 275-76 (4th Cir. 2003) (same).\n\n                                   II.\n\n                    Waiver of Rights to Jury Trial\n                   and to Counsel Under Federal Law\n\n           We analyze, under the federal standard, whether Frechette\n\n\"knowingly and intelligently\" waived his rights to jury trial and\n\nto counsel.    The district court's alternative holding was that if\n\nthe federal standard were applied, then Frechette's waiver of jury\n\ntrial was valid.    The court also held that Frechette's waiver of\n\nhis right to counsel was valid.     \"We review factual findings by the\n\ndistrict court for clear error\" and \"the determination of whether\n\na waiver of rights was voluntary de novo.\"          United States v.\n\nBezanson-Perkins, 390 F.3d 34, 39 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nA.         Waiver of Right to Jury Trial\n\n           Frechette's underlying state conviction was a \"Class D\"\n\nmisdemeanor, see Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, § 207, punishable\n\nby a term of imprisonment of up to one year under Maine law, id.\n\n§    1252(2)(D).     The   Maine   Constitution,   like   the   federal\n\nConstitution, provides the right to a jury trial for such an\n\noffense.      See State v. Sklar, 317 A.2d 160, 165 (Me. 1974)\n\n(construing the Maine Constitution, see Me. Const. art. I, § 6, to\n\n                                   -21-\n\fguarantee the right to a jury trial in all criminal prosecutions);\n\nsee also Baldwin, 399 U.S. at 69 (holding that the Sixth Amendment\n\nguarantees the right to a jury trial in the case of any offense for\n\nwhich imprisonment for more than six months is authorized).      A\n\ndefendant, however, may waive the jury trial right.       Adams v.\n\nUnited States ex rel. McCann, 317 U.S. 269, 275 (1942).\n\n          \"[W]hether or not there is an intelligent, competent,\n\nself-protecting waiver of jury trial by an accused must depend upon\n\nthe unique circumstances of each case.\"    Id. at 278. \"In making\n\nthis determination, courts may consider a variety of factors\n\nshowing that a waiver is validly given,\" including, but not limited\n\nto, \"the extent of the particular defendant's ability to understand\n\ncourtroom discussions regarding jury waiver.\"    Leja, 448 F.3d at\n\n93-94.\n\n          Here, the state court clearly advised all the defendants\n\npresent at the mass arraignment that each was \"entitled to a trial\n\nby a judge or jury,\" that each could exercise the right to a jury\n\ntrial by submitting a written request to the clerk within three\n\nweeks, and that each would be giving up the right to any type of\n\ntrial by pleading \"no contest\" or \"guilty.\"     Frechette conceded\n\nthat he was present at the mass arraignment, and the district court\n\nfound that \"he did hear the mass warning and nevertheless told the\n\n[state court] judge that he wanted to plead ['no contest'].\"\n\nFrechette, 372 F. Supp. 2d at 675-76.\n\n\n                               -22-\n\f           On appeal, Frechette points to his limited education and\n\nargues that \"there wasn't even an indication that [he] understood\n\neither the facts or the law applicable\"; however, nothing in the\n\nrecord shows that he did not hear or understand the state court's\n\ninstructions.     There was thus no clear error in the district\n\ncourt's finding to the contrary.\n\n           That the state court did not specifically say the words\n\n\"jury   trial\"   to   him   during    his   individual   colloquy,   after\n\nrepeatedly using it during the mass arraignment, does not render\n\nhis waiver invalid, so long as the waiver was knowingly and\n\nintelligently made.     See Leja, 448 F.3d at 93 (holding that even\n\n\"the absence of colloquy by itself does not require reversal where\n\nthe evidence establishes that the defendant's waiver [of jury\n\ntrial] was knowingly and intelligently made\" (emphasis added)).\n\nBased on this record, we conclude that Frechette \"knowingly and\n\nintelligently waived the right to have the case tried by a jury\"\n\nwithin the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(33)(B)(i)(II)(bb).\n\nB.         Waiver of Right to Counsel\n\n           This leaves Frechette's cross-appeal, in which he argues\n\nthat his domestic violence misdemeanor does not qualify as a\n\npredicate conviction because he was deprived of his right to\n\ncounsel.\n\n           \"The Sixth Amendment safeguards to an accused who faces\n\nincarceration the right to counsel at all critical stages of the\n\n\n                                     -23-\n\fcriminal process.

United States, 397 U.S.\n\n742, 748 (1970)).    \"The constitutional requirement is satisfied\n\nwhen the trial court informs the accused of the nature of the\n\ncharges against him, of his right to be counseled regarding his\n\nplea, and of the range of allowable punishments attendant upon the\n\nentry of a guilty plea.\"         Id.       The defendant invoking the\n\naffirmative defense under 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(33)(B)(i)(I) bears the\n\nburdens of production and persuasion to show that he did not\n\nknowingly and intelligently waive the right to counsel in the\n\npredicate misdemeanor domestic violence offense.         Hartsock, 347\n\nF.3d at 9.\n\n          The district court found that Frechette had conceded that\n\nthe state court advised him of his right to counsel at his October\n\n16, 1996 appearance.      Frechette, 372 F. Supp. 2d at 671.    At the\n\nmass arraignment, the state court informed the defendants that each\n\nhad the right to an attorney, and that if \"there is a probability\n\n\n                                  -24-\n\for a possibility that you could be facing jail if you are convicted\n\nof the crime that you are being charged with here, I would advise\n\nyou to get a lawyer or get legal advice.\"               The court also told the\n\ndefendants       that   each   could   request     court-appointed          counsel,\n\nprovided that each qualified financially.                 Subsequently, in the\n\nindividual plea colloquy, the court inquired into Frechette's\n\neligibility for a court-appointed lawyer, noted that he did not so\n\nqualify, and warned him personally that by pleading \"no contest,\"\n\nhe would \"waive [his] right to . . . the advice of a lawyer.\"\n\nFrechette indicated verbally that he understood, and he also signed\n\na written statement to that effect, which was also read aloud to\n\nhim.8       Frechette \"kn[ew] what he [was] doing and [made] his choice\n\n. . . with eyes open.\"         Adams, 317 U.S. at 279.\n\n               Frechette     argues,   however,     that        his   choice     was\n\neffectively made with his hands tied and so was involuntary.                      He\n\ncontends that the state court erred in determining that he did not\n\nqualify financially for court-appointed representation.                 He points\n\nto   the     state   court   docket,   which    shows    that    in   his    initial\n\nappearance on December 13, 1995, he had requested court-appointed\n\ncounsel, but his motion was denied because his \"income exceed[ed]\n\nguidelines for court appointment.\"             He alleges that his financial\n\ncircumstances changed for the worse after his initial appearance,\n\n\n\n        8\n          The signed waiver is not part of the record; however,\nFrechette does not dispute that he signed it.\n\n                                       -25-\n\fsuch that at the time of his \"no contest\" plea in October 1996, he\n\nshould have been deemed eligible for court-appointed counsel.\n\n               He thus asked the federal district court, almost ten\n\nyears after the fact, to make an independent examination of his\n\nfinancial circumstances at the time of his \"no contest\" plea to\n\ndetermine whether he was, for all practical purposes, denied his\n\nright     to    counsel    because     he   was    unable     to    afford     one.9\n\n               The district court denied his request to reopen the issue\n\nof his financial eligibility, and was correct in doing so.                       As\n\nalways, the decision to convene an evidentiary hearing is at the\n\ndiscretion of the trial judge, reversible only if that discretion\n\nwas abused.      See United States v. Panitz, 907 F.2d 1267, 1274 (1st\n\nCir. 1990).       No such abuse took place here.\n\n               Frechette    never      challenged       the     state     court's\n\ndetermination, either at his December 1995 appearance or at his\n\nOctober    1996     plea   colloquy,    that      he   was    not   eligible    for\n\ncourt-appointed counsel.       His financial information as of the time\n\nof the domestic violence conviction is not in the current record,\n\n\n     9\n          Although Frechette indicated in his request for an\nevidentiary hearing that he intended to present evidence that \"[h]e\ndoes not recall being advised of his right to a trial by jury,\"\nhis cross-appeal focuses solely on whether the district court erred\nin not allowing him an evidentiary hearing on the waiver of counsel\nissue. To the extent that he does raise an argument concerning the\nappropriateness of an evidentiary hearing with respect to the jury\ntrial issue, it is waived for lack of appellate development. See\nUnited States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"[I]ssues\nadverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort\nat developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\").\n\n                                       -26-\n\fand Frechette's proffer of such information includes only his\n\nhourly wage -- which, the district court observed, \"provides no\n\ninformation about other assets that might have been available to\n\n[him] in 1996\" or \"about the 1996 cost of legal services in\n\nLewiston, Maine.\"   Frechette, 372 F. Supp. 2d at 673.      Finally, and\n\nmost importantly, the district court already had a transcript of\n\nthe plea proceedings, from which it could readily determine whether\n\nFrechette had knowingly and intelligently waived his right to\n\ncounsel.\n\n           Nevertheless,   Frechette   argues   that   an   evidentiary\n\nhearing was required under our 2003 decision in United States v.\n\nHartsock, 347 F.3d 1.   Frechette overreads Hartsock.       In Hartsock,\n\nwe remanded to the district court for a hearing under Rule 104(a)\n\nof the Federal Rules of Evidence, id. at 10, because the parties\n\ndid not have access to a transcript or a recording of the plea\n\nproceedings and had agreed to allow the district court to hold a\n\nRule 104(a) hearing to recreate the state court record, id. at 4.\n\nWhile Hartsock permits a district court to hold an evidentiary\n\nhearing in such cases, it certainly does not compel a district\n\ncourt to hold an evidentiary hearing, especially when a true and\n\naccurate transcript of the relevant proceedings is available and is\n\na sufficient basis for determining whether the waiver of counsel\n\nwas knowing and intelligent.\n\n\n\n\n                                -27-\n\f           On    the    basis    of   the       record    before    us,    Frechette\n\n\"knowingly and intelligently waived the right to counsel,\" within\n\nthe meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(33)(B)(i)(I).\n\n                                         III.\n\n           We reverse the district court on the question of whether\n\nFrechette knowingly and intelligently waived his right to a jury\n\ntrial, affirm the district court's denial of Frechette's request\n\nfor an evidentiary hearing, affirm the district court's alternate\n\ndetermination    that    under     the    federal        constitutional     standard\n\nFrechette knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel,\n\nvacate   the    order    of     dismissal,       and     remand    for    proceedings\n\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -28-\n\f",

This offense was a misdemeanor, <i>see</i> Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &#167; 207, and Frechette was sentenced to a jail term of thirty days, which was immediately suspended, and to a one-year term of probation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1996 Congress passed, as part of the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act of 1997, the Lautenberg Amendment to the Gun Control Act of 1968 (\"the Amendment\"), Pub.L. No. 104-208, &#167; 658, 110 Stat. 3009, 3009-371 to -372 (1996) (codified as amended at 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 921, 922, 925). <i>See United States v. Hartsock,</i> 347 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir.2003). The Amendment was intended, in part, to address the growing national recognition of the importance of deterring domestic violence. <i>See id.</i> at 5 (citing sources). It expressed Congress's recognition that firearms were frequently used in domestic violence attacks. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress also recognized that there was a loophole in the law, which it moved to close. Although earlier law had restricted the possession of firearms by those convicted of domestic violence felonies, no such restrictions existed as to possession of firearms by persons convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors. <i>See id.</i> The Amendment eliminated this disparity. Under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(9), it is now unlawful for a person \"who has been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" to, inter alia, \"possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition.\" The statute defines \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" as an offense that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) is a misdemeanor under Federal, State, or Tribal law; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) has, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon, committed by a current or former spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabiting with or has cohabited with the victim as a spouse, parent, or guardian, or by a person similarly situated to a spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(33)(A).

Instead, he moved to dismiss the indictment on the basis that the 1996 offense did not count as a \"conviction\" within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(33)(B)(i)(I) and (II), because it was secured without his having \"knowingly and intelligently waived [both] the right to counsel,\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(33)(B)(i)(I), and \"the right to have the case tried by a jury,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 921(a)(33)(B)(i)(II).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The text of the affirmative defenses Frechette invoked provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) A person shall not be considered to have been convicted of [a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence] for purposes of this chapter, unless &#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(I) the person was represented by counsel in the case, or knowingly and intelligently waived the right to counsel in the case; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(II) in the case of a prosecution for an offense described in this paragraph for which a person was entitled to a jury trial in the jurisdiction in which the case was tried, either</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(aa) the case was tried by a jury, or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(bb) the person knowingly and intelligently waived the right to have the case tried by a jury, by guilty plea or otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> &#167; 921(a)(33)(B)(i).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute also sets forth another affirmative defense, which is set out just below those already described. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 921(a)(33)(B)(ii).

The transcript showed that the state court conducted a \"mass arraignment,\" in which it brought a large group of defendants into the courtroom and advised them collectively about their rights. Frechette does not dispute that he was among that group of defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Among other things, the court informed Frechette and the others that they had the right to a jury trial:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now here are your rights. Since you're here on a criminal charge, I want to advise you, first and foremost, that you're all presumed innocent until proven guilty. Under our system of justice, and the state and federal constitution[s], you are entitled to a trial by judge or jury. You are entitled to have the State, and by the State, I mean the law enforcement agency that has arrested you and charged you with a crime, to come to court and prove their case to a judge or jury....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also informed the group of defendants that each of them had the right to counsel:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third right and the last right that I want to explain to everybody is your right to an attorney. If any of you are here and there is a probability or a possibility that you could be facing jail if you are convicted of the crime that you are being charged with here, I would advise you to get a lawyer or get legal advice. Also, if you can't afford a lawyer, depending on your financial circumstances, you can ask me to appoint a lawyer at the State expense for you. Here's how that happens. You let me know. I'm obviously going to let you know how serious the offense is and you are going to be asked about whether you are going to represent yourself, hire a lawyer, or ask for a court appointed lawyer. If you ask for a court appointed lawyer, you're gonna be screened this morning by a financial screening officer who will interview you and decide whether you meet the guidelines for a court appointed lawyer. If you meet the guidelines, a lawyer will be appointed who practices within our jurisdiction here. . . . If you don't qualify, that means you will have to hire your own lawyer or represent yourself. Please understand the case doesn't go away because you don't get a court appointed lawyer. You still have to face the charges. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the court explained to the group that each defendant could enter one of three pleas, and that each would waive the rights to a trial and to counsel by pleading \"guilty\" or \"no contest\":</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I am going ask you to enter one of three pleas: Guilty, Not Guilty, No Contest. Guilty means what it says. It means that you will end up saying \"I'm Guilty\" &#8212; you admit the charge and we will impose a sentence this morning. If you plead Not Guilty, you are asking for a trial and I will give you a date for your trial. If you plead No Contest that means that you don't want to plead Guilty, but you don't want a trial and you want to dispose of the matter and you want to get rid of it today. There is still a conviction. In other words, I make a finding of guilt. The only difference is that you haven't pled guilty, you're still convicted without a trial. Those of you who plead Guilty and those of you who plead No Contest waive your right to a trial. Obviously, you're not going to have a trial. You waive your right also to get the advice of a lawyer, so please understand those consequences before you decide to plead Guilty. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now if you plead Not Guilty you'll get a date for trial &#8212; I told you that. Then we're going to hand you three pieces of paper . . . . Page One is your ticket to a jury trial. Since it's a criminal offense, you have a right to say, \"I want a jury trial instead of a judge trial.\" The reason you're in district court is because all of you are here on Class D and E crimes.... If you want a jury trial, you take the first piece of paper that is handed to you this morning and within three weeks of today's date, sign it and bring it to the clerk in the lobby.... If that happens, your case is transferred across the river and goes to the Superior Court in Auburn and you'll be notified by that court of the time and date of your trial by jury. If you don't file it within three weeks, you have to be here on the day I give you for a trial before a judge in this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the mass arraignment, the court engaged in an individual plea colloquy with Frechette. The court observed that Frechette had already pleaded \"not guilty\" at his initial appearance in state court and that he was presently before the court on a bench warrant for not showing up for trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The court advised Frechette that he \"ha[d] a right to either ask for a new court date if you want to do so,\" at which point Frechette seems to have interrupted and said \"no.\" Frechette then indicated that he wanted to change his plea to \"no contest,\" and the court warned him that by so doing, he would be waiving his \"right to trial.\" The court did not, however, as it had done earlier at the mass arraignment, invoke the phrase \"<i>jury</i> trial\":</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Court: All right, Mr. Frechette, you have already pled Not Guilty.

The magistrate judge, without ruling on Frechette's motion to dismiss the indictment, rejected his motion for an evidentiary hearing in a memorandum decision, to which Frechette timely objected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court subsequently allowed for oral argument, both on the magistrate judge's order denying Frechette an evidentiary hearing and on Frechette's motion to dismiss the indictment. In an opinion issued on June 10, 2005, the district court overruled Frechette's objection to the magistrate judge's order denying him an evidentiary hearing, but allowed his motion to dismiss. <i>See United States v. Frechette,</i> 372 F.Supp.2d 669, 676 (D.Me. 2005).

Rowell,</i> 468 A.2d 1005 (Me. 1983), the waiver was invalid, <i>see Frechette,</i> 372 F.Supp.2d at 675; (3) that Frechette was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing, <i>see id.</i> at 673; and (4) that Frechette had not shown that his waiver of counsel in the predicate state proceeding was invalid under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(33)(B)(i)(I), <i>see Frechette,</i> 372 F.Supp.2d at 673.

We review this question of statutory interpretation de novo. <i>United States v. Rosa-Ortiz,</i> 348 F.3d 33, 36 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that the validity of a waiver of jury trial for purposes of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(33)(B)(i)(II)(bb) is to be evaluated under the federal constitutional standard and that Frechette validly waived that right. We also hold that the district court was correct to conclude that Frechette was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing and that Frechette validly waived his right to counsel. As a result, we reverse the district court solely on the question of whether Frechette validly waived his right to a jury trial, vacate the order of dismissal, and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Interpretation of Statutory Provision Regarding Waiver of Jury Trial</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our task is to interpret the federal statute. A bit more precision is in order. The statute does define the standard for the waiver of the jury trial right: the standard is whether the person \"knowingly and intelligently\" waived the right to trial by jury. The question is whether the phrase \"knowingly and intelligently\" is to be measured by federal or state standards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question becomes meaningful in situations in which the standards turn out to be different. We can think of at least two such situations. The first is when the federal constitutional standard has been met, but state law, applying a more defendant-friendly standard of \"knowingly and intelligently,\" has not been met. The district court thought that was the situation here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second (at least hypothetical) situation is one in which the federal constitutional standard has not been met, but a less defendant-friendly state standard for waiver has been met. State law, after all, may give a defendant a right to a jury trial where one is not mandated by the Sixth Amendment, <i>see Duncan v. Louisiana,</i> 391 U.S. 145, 159-61, 88 S.Ct. 1444, 20 L.Ed.2d 491 (1968) (drawing a distinction between \"serious crimes\" and \"petty offenses,\" and holding that the Sixth Amendment entitles defendants to a jury trial only for serious crimes); <i>see also Baldwin v. New York,</i> 399 U.S. 66, 69, 90 S.Ct. 1886, 26 L.Ed.2d 437 (1970) (holding that \"no offense can be deemed `petty' for purposes of the right to trial by jury where imprisonment for more than six months is authorized\"), and where a state has chosen to do so, it is conceivable that it might allow a defendant to waive the right by some procedure that is less stringent than that required under federal law for waiving a constitutional right to a jury trial for serious crimes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Frechette's argument would have this court apply state law standards for what constitutes \"knowing[] and intelligent[ ]\" waiver, regardless of whether the particular state law being invoked affords greater or lesser protection to defendants than would the federal constitutional standard. Under his theory, Congress would have to have intended for there not to be one national standard for \"knowing[] and intelligent[ ]\" waiver, but a large number of state-created standards, some of which may be more defendant-friendly and others of which may be more defendant-hostile.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's position is that the statute requires the application of a uniform federal standard. Use of normal principles of statutory interpretation favors this reading, although the text is not so clear as to eliminate all questions. Furthermore, Frechette argues that because the statute does at times incorporate state standards, national uniformity in the federal statutory scheme to control domestic violence is not the consistent guiding principle throughout the statute. Still, we agree with the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, when a federal statutory term such as \"knowingly and intelligently\" is used, ordinarily the interpretation is supplied by federal law, not state law, absent some express language to the contrary. <i>See Jerome v. United States,</i> 318 U.S. 101, 104, 63 S.Ct. 483, 87 L.Ed. 640 (1943) (\"[W]e must generally assume, in the absence of a plain indication to the contrary, that Congress when it enacts a statute is not making the application of the federal act dependent on state law.\"); <i>see also Dickerson v. New Banner Inst., Inc.,</i> 460 U.S. 103, 119-20, 103 S.Ct. 986, 74 L.Ed.2d 845 (1983) (noting that \"`in the absence of a plain indication to the contrary, . . . it is to be assumed when Congress enacts a statute that it does not intend to make its application dependent on state law[,]'\" because \"the application of federal legislation is nationwide and at times the federal program would be impaired if state law were to control\" (quoting <i>NLRB v. Natural Gas Util. Dist.,</i> 402 U.S. 600, 603, 91 S.Ct. 1746, 29 L.Ed.2d 206 (1971))), <i>superseded by statute,</i> Firearm Owners' Protection Act, Pub.L. No. 99-308, 100 Stat. 449 (1986), <i>as recognized in Molina v. INS,</i> 981 F.2d 14, 22 (1st Cir.1992); <i>United States v. Ayala-Gomez,</i> 255 F.3d 1314, 1319 (11th Cir.2001) (per curiam) (\"Words in federal statutes reflect federal understandings, absent an explicit statement to the contrary, even if a state uses the word differently.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the very phrase \"knowingly and intelligently\" can easily be read as a shorthand encapsulation of the federal constitutional standard. <i>See, e.g., Patton v. United States,</i> 281 U.S. 276, 312, 50 S.Ct. 253, 74 L.Ed. 854 (1930) (\"Not only must the right of the accused to a trial by a constitutional jury be jealously preserved, but the maintenance of the jury as a fact-finding body in criminal cases is of such importance and has such a place in our traditions, that, before any waiver can become effective, the consent of government counsel and the sanction of the court must be had, in addition to the express and intelligent consent of the defendant.\"), <i>abrogated on other grounds by Williams v. Florida,</i> 399 U.S. 78, 90 S.Ct. 1893, 26 L.Ed.2d 446 (1970); <i>accord United States v. Leja,</i> 448 F.3d 86, 96 (1st Cir.2006) (upholding validity of jury trial waiver, so long as it was \"knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently\" made); <i>cf. Edwards v. Arizona,</i> 451 U.S. 477, 482, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 68 L.Ed.2d 378 (1981) (noting that \"waivers of counsel must not only be voluntary, but must also constitute a knowing and intelligent relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege\"); <i>Boykin v. Alabama,</i> 395 U.S. 238, 242, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969) (requiring that a plea be \"intelligent and voluntary\"); <i>Johnson v. Zerbst,</i> 304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the structure of the statute favors the government's construction that the jury waiver question is to be analyzed under the federal constitutional standard. The affirmative defense under discussion has two subsections, (I) and (II):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) A person shall not be considered to have been convicted of [a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence] for purposes of this chapter unless &#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(I) the person was represented by counsel in the case, or knowingly and intelligently waived the right to counsel in the case; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(II) in the case of a prosecution for an offense described in this paragraph for which a person was entitled to a jury trial in the jurisdiction in which the case was tried, either</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(aa) the case was tried by a jury, or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(bb) the person knowingly and intelligently waived the right to have the case tried by a jury, by guilty plea or otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(33)(B)(i). The parties agree that in subsection (I), which deals with the right to counsel, the term \"knowingly and intelligently waived\" is to be analyzed under the federal constitutional standard. Only in subsection (II), which deals with the jury trial right, does Frechette argue that the <i>very same term</i> is to be analyzed under state law. There are two prongs to his argument. First, he points out that subsection (II) refers to \"the jurisdiction in which the case was tried\" to determine whether there was any jury trial right at all. Second, he notes that the second affirmative defense to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(9), set out in the paragraph immediately below the affirmative defense under discussion, excludes as predicate convictions those offenses for which the person \"has had civil rights restored (if the law of the applicable jurisdiction provides for the loss of civil rights under [such an] offense).\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(33)(B)(ii). The reasoning, propounded by Frechette and employed by the district court, is that if Congress explicitly referred to the law of the jurisdiction in which the offense was committed to determine whether there is a jury trial right at all and to determine whether there is a loss of civil rights for a certain offense, Congress implicitly meant all issues concerning the right to a jury trial, including waiver, to be resolved by looking to state standards. On balance, we think this approach is wrong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On its face, the separate restoration of civil rights provision itself has nothing to do with the right to a jury trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That Congress referred to state law to define whether there was any jury trial right at all has an independent rationale. As noted earlier, states may provide jury trials even when they are not compelled by the federal Constitution to do so. It is easier to administer the federal statute by simply accepting the states' choice to give or not to give a jury trial; that is a background fact against which the whole provision operates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But, as this case demonstrates, it is not easier to administer the federal statute by then looking to state law to determine what is meant by a \"knowing[] and intelligent[ ]\" waiver of the right to a jury trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> A single, well-understood federal standard for waiver of jury trial is clearly easier for federal courts to apply than would be a patchwork of conflicting and changing state laws. <i>See Jerome,</i> 318 U.S. at 104, 63 S.Ct. 483 (noting \"the desirability of uniformity in application\" of federal criminal laws); <i>cf. Dickerson,</i> 460 U.S. at 111-12, 103 S.Ct. 986 (holding that \"[w]hether one has been `convicted' within the language of the gun control statutes is necessarily ... a question of federal, not state, law, despite the fact that the predicate offense and its punishment are defined by the law of the [s]tate\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the statute, both references to state law (in relation to whether a jury is available and to whether there is a loss of civil rights) are isolated structurally and grammatically from the subsection, &#167; 921(a)(33)(B)(i)(II)(bb), setting forth the requirement of a \"knowing[ ] and intelligent[] waive[r]\" of the jury trial right. It is tempting to credit this arrangement as evidence that Congress knew how to direct attention to state law standards when it so desired and that it purposefully did not do so as to waiver of the jury trial right.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> <i>See Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co.,</i> 534 U.S. 438, 452, 122 S.Ct. 941, 151 L.Ed.2d 908 (2002) (\"[I]t is a general principle of statutory construction that when `Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.'\" (quoting <i>Russello v. United States,</i> 464 U.S. 16, 23, 104 S.Ct. 296, 78 L.Ed.2d 17 (1983))).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The text, while not entirely plain, is more consistent with an intent by Congress that the term \"knowingly and intelligently\" be interpreted by the federal constitutional standard, and not by state standards. We have already mentioned that federal statutes are usually defined by federal law, that there is no express reference to state law in this particular provision where one might otherwise expect one, and that the statute is more easily and better administered by use of one standard &#8212; and a familiar one at that. The view that state law governs the content of \"knowing[ ] and intelligent[ ] waive[r]\" of the jury trial right also, as we have described, raises the risk of lowering protections for defendants in situations in which state law standards for waiver are more relaxed than those set forth by the federal constitutional standard. That is all the more reason to give the statute its most natural reading, that the \"knowing[ ] and intelligent[ ]\" standard is to be determined by the federal constitutional standard. This appears to be the practice of other circuits. <i>See United States v. Bethurum,</i> 343 F.3d 712, 718 (5th Cir.2003) (applying, without discussion, federal constitutional standard to the question of whether a jury trial waiver was \"knowing[ ] and intelligent[ ]\" within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(33)(B)(i)(II)(bb)); <i>United States v.

At the mass arraignment, the state court informed the defendants that each had the right to an attorney, and that if \"there is a probability or a possibility that you could be facing jail if you are convicted of the crime that you are being charged with here, I would advise you to get a lawyer or get legal advice.\" The court also told the defendants that each could request court-appointed counsel, provided that each qualified financially. Subsequently, in the individual plea colloquy, the court inquired into Frechette's eligibility for a court-appointed lawyer, noted that he did not so qualify, and warned him personally that by pleading \"no contest,\" he would \"waive [his] right to . . . the advice of a lawyer.\" Frechette indicated verbally that he understood, and he also signed a written statement to that effect, which was also read aloud to him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Frechette \"kn[ew] what he [was] doing and [made] his choice . . . with eyes open.\" <i>Adams,</i> 317 U.S. at 279, 63 S.Ct. 236.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Frechette argues, however, that his choice was effectively made with his hands tied and so was involuntary. He contends that the state court erred in determining that he did not qualify financially for court-appointed representation. He points to the state court docket, which shows that in his initial appearance on December 13, 1995, he had requested court-appointed counsel, but his motion was denied because his \"income exceed[ed] guidelines for court appointment.\" He alleges that his financial circumstances changed for the worse after his initial appearance, such that at the time of his \"no contest\" plea in October 1996, he should have been deemed eligible for court-appointed counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He thus asked the federal district court, almost ten years after the fact, to make an independent examination of his financial circumstances at the time of his \"no contest\" plea to determine whether he was, for all practical purposes, denied his right to counsel because he was unable to afford one.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied his request to reopen the issue of his financial eligibility, and was correct in doing so. As always, the decision to convene an evidentiary hearing is at the discretion of the trial judge, reversible only if that discretion was abused. <i>See United States v. Panitz,</i> 907 F.2d 1267, 1274 (1st Cir.1990). No such abuse took place here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Frechette never challenged the state court's determination, either at his December 1995 appearance or at his October 1996 plea colloquy, that he was not eligible for court-appointed counsel. His financial information as of the time of the domestic violence conviction is not in the current record, and Frechette's proffer of such information includes only his hourly wage &#8212; which, the district court observed, \"provides no information about other assets that might have been available to [him] in 1996\" or \"about the 1996 cost of legal services in Lewiston, Maine.\" <i>Frechette,</i> 372 F.Supp.2d at 673. Finally, and most importantly, the district court already had a transcript of the plea proceedings, from which it could readily determine whether Frechette had knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, Frechette argues that an evidentiary hearing was required under our 2003 decision in <i>United States v.

While <i>Hartsock</i> permits a district court to hold an evidentiary hearing in such cases, it certainly does not <i>compel</i> a district court to hold an evidentiary hearing, especially when a true and accurate transcript of the relevant proceedings is available and is a sufficient basis for determining whether the waiver of counsel was knowing and intelligent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the basis of the record before us, Frechette \"knowingly and intelligently waived the right to counsel,\" within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(33)(B)(i)(I).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We <i>reverse</i> the district court on the question of whether Frechette knowingly and intelligently waived his right to a jury trial, <i>affirm</i> the district court's denial of Frechette's request for an evidentiary hearing, <i>affirm</i> the district court's alternate determination that under the federal constitutional standard Frechette knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel, <i>vacate</i> the order of dismissal, and <i>remand</i> for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(a) sets out the penalties for, inter alia, the knowing violation of &#167; 922(g)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> There is some confusion in the record about what happened at Frechette's initial arraignment, which took place on December 13, 1995.

However, the docket also indicates that a hearing notice was issued to Frechette on September 3, 1996, apparently ordering him to appear in court on October 3, 1996. He failed to appear on that date, and a bench warrant was issued for his arrest.

This offense was a misdemeanor, <i>see</i> Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &#167; 207, and Frechette was sentenced to a jail term of thirty days, which was immediately suspended, and to a one-year term of probation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1996 Congress passed, as part of the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act of 1997, the Lautenberg Amendment to the Gun Control Act of 1968 (\"the Amendment\"), Pub.L. No. 104-208, &#167; 658, 110 Stat. 3009, 3009-371 to -372 (1996) (codified as amended at 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 921, 922, 925). <i>See United States v.

The Amendment was intended, in part, to address the growing national recognition of the importance of deterring domestic violence. <i>See id.</i> at 5 (citing sources). It expressed Congress's recognition that firearms were frequently used in domestic violence attacks. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress also recognized that there was a loophole in the law, which it moved to close. Although earlier law had restricted the possession of firearms by those convicted of domestic violence felonies, no such restrictions existed as to possession of firearms by persons convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors. <i>See id.</i> The Amendment eliminated this disparity. Under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(9), it is now unlawful for a person \"who has been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" to, inter alia, \"possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition.\" The statute defines \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" as an offense that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) is a misdemeanor under Federal, State, or Tribal law; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) has, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon, committed by a current or former spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabiting with or has cohabited with the victim as a spouse, parent, or guardian, or by a person similarly situated to a spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(33)(A).

The transcript showed that the state court conducted a \"mass arraignment,\" in which it brought a large group of defendants into the courtroom and advised them collectively about their rights.

If any of you are here and there is a probability or a possibility that you could be facing jail if you are convicted of the crime that you are being charged with here, I would advise you to get a lawyer or get legal advice. Also, if you can't afford a lawyer, depending on your financial circumstances, you can ask me to appoint a lawyer at the State expense for you. Here's how that happens. You let me know. I'm obviously going to let you know how serious the offense is and you are going to be asked about whether you are going to represent yourself, hire a lawyer, or ask for a court appointed lawyer. If you ask for a court appointed lawyer, you're gonna be screened this morning by a financial screening officer who will interview you and decide whether you meet the guidelines for a court appointed lawyer. If you meet the guidelines, a lawyer will be appointed who practices within our jurisdiction here. . . . If you don't qualify, that means you will have to hire your own lawyer or represent yourself. Please understand the case doesn't go away because you don't get a court appointed lawyer.

Guilty means what it says. It means that you will end up saying \"I'm Guilty\" &#8212; you admit the charge and we will impose a sentence this morning. If you plead Not Guilty, you are asking for a trial and I will give you a date for your trial. If you plead No Contest that means that you don't want to plead Guilty, but you don't want a trial and you want to dispose of the matter and you want to get rid of it today. There is still a conviction. In other words, I make a finding of guilt. The only difference is that you haven't pled guilty, you're still convicted without a trial. Those of you who plead Guilty and those of you who plead No Contest waive your right to a trial. Obviously, you're not going to have a trial. You waive your right also to get the advice of a lawyer, so please understand those consequences before you decide to plead Guilty. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now if you plead Not Guilty you'll get a date for trial &#8212; I told you that. Then we're going to hand you three pieces of paper . . . . Page One is your ticket to a jury trial. Since it's a criminal offense, you have a right to say, \"I want a jury trial instead of a judge trial.\" The reason you're in district court is because all of you are here on Class D and E crimes.... If you want a jury trial, you take the first piece of paper that is handed to you this morning and within three weeks of today's date, sign it and bring it to the clerk in the lobby....

Rowell,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1005</span></span> (Me. 1983), the waiver was invalid, <i>see Frechette,</i> 372 F.Supp.2d at 675; (3) that Frechette was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing, <i>see id.</i> at 673; and (4) that Frechette had not shown that his waiver of counsel in the predicate state proceeding was invalid under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(33)(B)(i)(I), <i>see Frechette,</i> 372 F.Supp.2d at 673.

We review this question of statutory interpretation de novo. <i>United States v. Rosa-Ortiz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784026\"><a href=\"/opinion/784026/united-states-v-miguel-rosa-ortiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">348</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span>, 36 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that the validity of a waiver of jury trial for purposes of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(33)(B)(i)(II)(bb) is to be evaluated under the federal constitutional standard and that Frechette validly waived that right. We also hold that the district court was correct to conclude that Frechette was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing and that Frechette validly waived his right to counsel. As a result, we reverse the district court solely on the question of whether Frechette validly waived his right to a jury trial, vacate the order of dismissal, and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Interpretation of Statutory Provision Regarding Waiver of Jury Trial</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our task is to interpret the federal statute. A bit more precision is in order. The statute does define the standard for the waiver of the jury trial right: the standard is whether the person \"knowingly and intelligently\" waived the right to trial by jury. The question is whether the phrase \"knowingly and intelligently\" is to be measured by federal or state standards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question becomes meaningful in situations in which the standards turn out to be different. We can think of at least two such situations. The first is when the federal constitutional standard has been met, but state law, applying a more defendant-friendly standard of \"knowingly and intelligently,\" has not been met. The district court thought that was the situation here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second (at least hypothetical) situation is one in which the federal constitutional standard has not been met, but a less defendant-friendly state standard for waiver has been met. State law, after all, may give a defendant a right to a jury trial where one is not mandated by the Sixth Amendment, <i>see Duncan v. Louisiana,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107685\"><a href=\"/opinion/107685/duncan-v-louisiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">145</span></a></span>, 159-61, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107685\"><a href=\"/opinion/107685/duncan-v-louisiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Under his theory, Congress would have to have intended for there not to be one national standard for \"knowing[] and intelligent[ ]\" waiver, but a large number of state-created standards, some of which may be more defendant-friendly and others of which may be more defendant-hostile.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's position is that the statute requires the application of a uniform federal standard. Use of normal principles of statutory interpretation favors this reading, although the text is not so clear as to eliminate all questions. Furthermore, Frechette argues that because the statute does at times incorporate state standards, national uniformity in the federal statutory scheme to control domestic violence is not the consistent guiding principle throughout the statute. Still, we agree with the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, when a federal statutory term such as \"knowingly and intelligently\" is used, ordinarily the interpretation is supplied by federal law, not state law, absent some express language to the contrary. <i>See Jerome v.

The parties agree that in subsection (I), which deals with the right to counsel, the term \"knowingly and intelligently waived\" is to be analyzed under the federal constitutional standard. Only in subsection (II), which deals with the jury trial right, does Frechette argue that the <i>very same term</i> is to be analyzed under state law. There are two prongs to his argument. First, he points out that subsection (II) refers to \"the jurisdiction in which the case was tried\" to determine whether there was any jury trial right at all. Second, he notes that the second affirmative defense to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(9), set out in the paragraph immediately below the affirmative defense under discussion, excludes as predicate convictions those offenses for which the person \"has had civil rights restored (if the law of the applicable jurisdiction provides for the loss of civil rights under [such an] offense).\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(33)(B)(ii). The reasoning, propounded by Frechette and employed by the district court, is that if Congress explicitly referred to the law of the jurisdiction in which the offense was committed to determine whether there is a jury trial right at all and to determine whether there is a loss of civil rights for a certain offense, Congress implicitly meant all issues concerning the right to a jury trial, including waiver, to be resolved by looking to state standards.

As noted earlier, states may provide jury trials even when they are not compelled by the federal Constitution to do so. It is easier to administer the federal statute by simply accepting the states' choice to give or not to give a jury trial; that is a background fact against which the whole provision operates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But, as this case demonstrates, it is not easier to administer the federal statute by then looking to state law to determine what is meant by a \"knowing[] and intelligent[ ]\" waiver of the right to a jury trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> A single, well-understood federal standard for waiver of jury trial is clearly easier for federal courts to apply than would be a patchwork of conflicting and changing state laws. <i>See Jerome,</i> 318 U.S. at 104, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We have already mentioned that federal statutes are usually defined by federal law, that there is no express reference to state law in this particular provision where one might otherwise expect one, and that the statute is more easily and better administered by use of one standard &#8212; and a familiar one at that. The view that state law governs the content of \"knowing[ ] and intelligent[ ] waive[r]\" of the jury trial right also, as we have described, raises the risk of lowering protections for defendants in situations in which state law standards for waiver are more relaxed than those set forth by the federal constitutional standard. That is all the more reason to give the statute its most natural reading, that the \"knowing[ ] and intelligent[ ]\" standard is to be determined by the federal constitutional standard.
