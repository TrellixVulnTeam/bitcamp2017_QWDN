Petitioner      Henderson   M.\n\nLumataw, a native and citizen of Indonesia, seeks review of a\n\ndecision    issued   by   the   Board    of   Immigration   Appeals    (\"BIA\")\n\naffirming     the    Immigration    Judge's      (\"IJ's\")   denial    of     his\n\napplication    for   political     asylum,    withholding   of    removal    and\n\nprotection under the Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\").1              Lumataw\n\nentered the United States in 1995 and filed his I-589 application\n\nfor asylum in 2005 on the basis of past persecution and fear of\n\nfuture persecution in Indonesia on account of his religious status\n\nas a practicing Christian.         The BIA affirmed the IJ's denial of\n\nasylum on the ground that Lumataw failed to allege sufficient\n\nchanged circumstances in Indonesia to excuse his failure to timely\n\nfile his asylum application within one year of his 1995 arrival.\n\nThe BIA also agreed with the IJ's conclusion that Lumataw had not\n\nestablished past persecution and that he would not \"more likely\n\nthan not\" be persecuted in the future if he returned to Indonesia.\n\n            In this petition for review, Lumataw challenges the\n\nagency's determinations on the merits of his asylum claim, but also\n\nalleges that the BIA erred as a matter of law in holding his\n\napplication to be untimely because the one-year filing deadline had\n\nnot yet been enacted into law at the time of his initial entry.\n\nAfter careful review of the record, we hold that the IJ and BIA\n\n\n1\n   Since Lumataw did not raise his CAT claim in his appellate\nbrief, that basis for his application is deemed waived.

We thus grant the instant petition and remand.\n\n                                 I.   Background\n\nA. Factual Background\n\n            Henderson M. Lumataw is a 35 year-old citizen and native\n\nof Indonesia.      He identifies himself as a Christian Protestant.\n\nThe incident upon which Lumataw's claim of past persecution is\n\npremised took place in Indonesia in August 1995.                   On that date,\n\nwhile traveling through Indonesia, Lumataw was accosted by a thief\n\nwho was subsequently joined by three additional attackers. Lumataw\n\nidentified these individuals as Muslims due to their headdresses\n\nand sarong attire.        Seeing the cross necklace around Lumataw's\n\nneck, one of the attackers accused Lumataw of being Christian. The\n\nattacker pointed a knife at Lumataw's neck and threatened to kill\n\nhim, saying \"I want to kill you Christian.\"                Ultimately, Lumataw\n\nescaped the attackers after they had robbed him of his cross\n\nnecklace. Lumataw was very shaken by the incident. Thereafter, he\n\nleft Indonesia for the United States.\n\n            Lumataw entered the United States on September 12, 1995\n\non a non-immigrant visitor with authorization to remain for six\n\nmonths.     According to Lumataw, he overstayed out of fear of being\n\nthreatened, tortured, or killed if he returned to Indonesia,\n\nbecause of his status as a Christian.            Lumataw explained, however,\n\nthat   he    did   not   apply    for   asylum     right    away    because   the\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\finterreligious conflict between Muslims and Christians was not as\n\nperilous in 1995 as it would later become.      Country conditions\n\nevidence on the record, including U.S. State Department Human\n\nRights Reports, confirms the increase in interreligious tensions in\n\nIndonesia in the late 1990s and early 2000s.   On October 5, 2002,\n\nin New Hampshire, Lumataw married Vonnie Golioth (\"Golioth\"), also\n\na Protestant Christian of Indonesian nationality.\n\nB.   Procedural History\n\n           On January 27, 2003, Golioth applied for asylum and\n\nLumataw was included in his wife's application. On April 11, 2003,\n\nthe Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") served him with a\n\nNotice to Appear (\"NTA\") charging him with being removable under 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B), as an alien who remained in the United\n\nStates for a time longer than permitted.   In 2005, Lumataw filed\n\nhis own application for asylum under § 208 of the Immigration and\n\nNationality Act (\"INA\"), and in the alternative, withholding of\n\nremoval under § 241(b)(3) of the INA and under the CAT.2\n\n           1.   The IJ Decision\n\n           On January 26, 2006 a hearing was held before an IJ on\n\nthe merits of Lumataw's application.     In addition to Lumataw's\n\ntestimony, Golioth also testified about incidents of violence and\n\n\n\n\n2\n   Lumataw had requested that the IJ consolidate his separate\nasylum application with his wife's application, but the request was\ndenied.\n\n                                  -4-\n\fintimidation inflicted on Christians by Muslims in Indonesia.                   The\n\nIJ issued an oral decision that day.\n\n           The IJ identified the \"timeliness\" of Lumataw's asylum\n\napplication as the threshold question for the court, noting that\n\nLumataw's asylum application was \"filed approximately 10 years\n\nafter he entered the United States.\"3            The IJ reasoned that \"while\n\nperiods   of    social   conflict    can      intervene   between   [Lumataw's]\n\narrival in the United States and the time he applied for asylum,\n\n[Lumataw] has not established that circumstances have changed to\n\nthe point where his eligibility for asylum has been materially\n\naffected.\"     Finding no evidence of \"a change in circumstances that\n\nwould justify a late filing in this case,\" the IJ held that\n\nLumataw's application for asylum was untimely.\n\n           As    to   the    material    aspects     of   Lumataw's      remaining\n\nwithholding of removal claim, the IJ found Lumataw to be generally\n\ncredible, but concluded that even if Lumataw's attackers were\n\nmotivated by animosity towards Christians, one isolated attack, far\n\nfrom   Lumataw's      home   or   workplace,     with     no   injury,    did   not\n\nconstitute     past   persecution.         Finding    that     Lumataw    had   not\n\nestablished past persecution, no presumption of future persecution\n\n\n\n3\n   As explained infra, normally, an asylum application must be\nfiled within one-year of an alien's arrival, unless he arrives\nprior to April 1, 1997, in which case, the filing deadline is one-\nyear from that date. See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B); 8 C.F.R.\n§ 1208.4(a)(2)(ii).      Exceptions do apply.       See 8 U.S.C.\n§ 1158(a)(2)(D).\n\n                                        -5-\n\fapplied either.     Furthermore, the IJ concluded that Lumataw could\n\nnot prove it was \"more likely than not\" that he would be persecuted\n\nif he returned to Indonesia, and thus, the IJ also denied his\n\napplication for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of\n\nthe INA.   The IJ also noted that country conditions in Indonesia do\n\nnot support the conclusion that Lumataw would \"more likely than\n\nnot\" be persecuted, should he be removed to Indonesia.           Lumataw's\n\napplication for CAT relief was also denied.              Finally, the IJ\n\nconcluded that Lumataw was eligible for voluntary departure.\n\n           2. The BIA Decision\n\n           On May 16, 2008, the BIA dismissed Lumataw's appeal.          On\n\nthe issue of timeliness, the BIA \"agree[d] with the [IJ] that\n\n[Lumataw] had failed to establish sufficient changed circumstances\n\nin Indonesia to excuse his failure to timely file his application\n\nfor asylum.\"    Although Lumataw had argued to the BIA that the IJ\n\nhad   failed   to   acknowledge   his   inclusion   in   his   wife's   2003\n\napplication, the BIA held that Lumataw \"failed to demonstrate that\n\nthe [IJ's] omission of this fact supports a finding that his\n\nfailure to file his application for asylum within one year of his\n\narrival in the United States in 1995 should be excused based on\n\nchanged circumstances in Indonesia.\"\n\n           As to the merits of Lumataw's alternative withholding of\n\nremoval claim, the BIA adopted the reasoning of the IJ that Lumataw\n\nhad failed to establish either past persecution or that he would\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\f\"more likely than not\" be persecuted in the future, so as to\n\nsupport withholding of removal.    The BIA also rejected his claims\n\nunder the CAT.\n\n           A timely petition for review in this court followed.   In\n\nthis petition Lumataw argues that the IJ and BIA erred as a matter\n\nof law in holding his asylum application to be untimely, as those\n\ndecisions rested on Lumataw's failure to file within one year of\n\nhis initial entry in 1995 when no filing deadline had yet been\n\nenacted into law, as well as a failure to consider his inclusion in\n\nhis wife's earlier-filed petition. Lumataw further argues that the\n\nIJ and BIA erred in ruling that Lumataw failed to make out a case\n\nof past persecution. Finally, Lumataw argues that should we remand\n\non the first issue, he should be entitled, on remand, to present an\n\nasylum claim based on \"well-founded fear of future persecution.\"\n\n                           II. Discussion\n\nA.   Applicable Law\n\n           \"To establish eligibility for asylum, an alien must prove\n\neither past persecution, which gives rise to an inference of future\n\npersecution, or establish a well founded fear of future persecution\n\non account of her race, religion, nationality, membership in a\n\nsocial group, or political opinion.\"    Hem v. Mukasey, 514 F.3d 67,\n\n69 (1st Cir. 2008).   In contrast, \"[t]o qualify for withholding of\n\nremoval, an alien must show that, more likely than not, he faces\n\npersecution on account of one of [these] five protected grounds,\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f. . . should he return to his homeland.\"            Pan v. Gonzales, 489 F.3d\n\n80, 85-86 (1st Cir. 2007) (emphasis added); see also 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1101(a)(42)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(2).                 \"This 'more likely\n\nthan not' standard is harder for an alien to satisfy than the\n\n'reasonable possibility' standard for showing a well-founded fear\n\nof future persecution in asylum cases.\"             Pan, 489 F.3d at 86.\n\n             Unlike a withholding of removal application, which is not\n\nsubject to a filing deadline, see 8 C.F.R. § 1208.4(a), \"[a]n\n\nasylum application must ordinarily be filed 'within one year after\n\nthe date of the alien's arrival in the United States,' or by\n\nApril 1, 1998, whichever is later.\"           Oroh, 561 F.3d at 66 (internal\n\ncitations and quotation marks omitted); see also 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)\n\n(2)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 1208.4(a)(2)(ii) (explaining that the \"1-year\n\nperiod shall be calculated from the date of the alien's last\n\narrival in the United States or April 1, 1997, whichever is\n\nlater\").     Prior to the enactment of this one-year bar, effective\n\nApril   1,   1997,   there   was   no    mandated    time    limit   for   filing\n\napplications for asylum.       See In re F-P-R-, 24 I. & N. Dec. 681,\n\n685 (B.I.A. 2009) (referencing Congress \"enact[ment] [of] the 1-\n\nyear filing period in 1996.\").\n\n             An application for asylum may be considered beyond the\n\none-year deadline, however, \"if an applicant demonstrates 'changed\n\ncircumstances which materially affect the applicant's eligibility\n\nfor asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\ffiling.'\" Oroh, 561 F.3d at 66 (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(D); 8\n\nC.F.R. §§ 1208.4(a)(4), (5)); Rashad v. Mukasey, 554 F.3d 1, 4 (1st\n\nCir. 2009).      \"Changed circumstances\" may include \"[c]hanges in\n\nconditions in the applicant's country of nationality\" or \"[c]hanges\n\nin   the   applicant's     circumstances      that   materially    affect   the\n\napplicant's eligibility for asylum, including changes in applicable\n\nU.S. law and activities the applicant becomes involved in outside\n\nthe country of feared persecution that place the applicant at\n\nrisk.\"     8 C.F.R. § 1208.4(a)(4)(i).        \"Extraordinary circumstances\"\n\nrefers to \"events or factors directly related to the failure to\n\nmeet the 1-year deadline.\"        8 C.F.R. § 1208.4(a)(5).        An applicant\n\nattempting to demonstrate changed or extraordinary circumstances\n\nmust also demonstrate that he \"filed the application 'within a\n\nreasonable period' given those circumstances.\"            Oroh, 561 F.3d at\n\n66 (quoting 8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.4(a)(4), (5)).\n\nB.   Standard of Review\n\n             \"Usually, this court confines its review to the BIA's\n\norder that is being challenged by the petitioner.\"                Rashad, 554\n\nF.3d at 4.    \"However, when as here, the BIA adopts the decision of\n\nthe IJ, and provides some analysis of its own, the Court reviews\n\nboth decisions.\"     Id.\n\n             We will uphold the factual findings of the IJ and BIA \"if\n\nthey   are   supported     by   reasonable,    substantial,   and   probative\n\nevidence on the record considered as a whole.\"           Acevedo-Aguilar v.\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fMukasey, 517 F.3d 8, 9 (1st Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).   Under the substantial evidence standard, this court may\n\nnot reverse the decision below unless the record compels a contrary\n\nconclusion.     See INS v. Elías-Zacarías, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992)\n\n(applying this standard); Acevedo-Aguilar, 517 F.3d at 9 (same).\n\nWhether a petitioner has demonstrated past persecution is usually\n\na factual determination subject only to the highly deferential\n\nsubstantial evidence standard.             See Elías-Zacarías, 502 U.S. at\n\n483-84; Pangemanan v. Holder, 569 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2009); Silva\n\nv. Gonzales, 463 F.3d 68, 72 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n            Certain agency factual determinations are, however, by\n\nstatute excluded from judicial review.          See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(3).4\n\nAs   relevant   to   this    appeal,   §   1158(a)(3)    \"divests   courts      of\n\njurisdiction    to    review    determinations      of     timeliness   or     the\n\napplicability of exceptions to the one-year rule.\"              Oroh, 561 F.3d\n\nat 66.    \"The only exception to this bright-line rule is contained\n\nin 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D), which carves out an exception allowing\n\ncourts to review 'constitutional claims or questions of law.'\" Id.\n\nat 62 (quoting Hana v. Gonzales, 503 F.3d 39, 42 (1st Cir. 2007)).\n\nTo form the basis of judicial review under § 1252(a)(2)(D), the\n\nalleged   \"underlying       constitutional    or   legal    question    must    be\n\n\n4\n   Specifically, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(3) states that \"[n]o court\nshall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney\nGeneral under paragraph (2),\" with paragraph 2 governing various\nbars to asylum eligibility, including time limits for application\nand exceptions thereto.\n\n                                       -10-\n\fcolorable; that is, the argument advanced must, at the very least,\n\nhave some potential validity.\"    Pan, 489 F.3d at 84.\n\n           These deferential review standards \"'do[] not . . .\n\npreclude a court from vacating the BIA's asylum determination and\n\nremanding a case for further consideration where the BIA's denial\n\nof asylum was based upon an error of law.\"    Rojo v. Mukasey, 297\n\nFed. App'x 709, 711 (9th Cir. 2008) (unpublished) (quoting Kotasz\n\nv. INS, 31 F.3d 847, 851 (9th Cir. 1994).       The harmless error\n\ndoctrine, however, informs the propriety of remand in the face of\n\nlegal error.   See Nadal-Ginard v. Holder, 558 F.3d 61, 69 n.7 (1st\n\nCir. 2009) (citing support for proposition that harmless error\n\ndoctrine applies to judicial review of immigration decision).\n\nC.   Petition for Review\n\n           1. Timeliness\n\n           Lumataw argues that the IJ and BIA erred as a matter of\n\nlaw in assessing the timeliness of his I-589 application for\n\nasylum.   This is because the BIA reasoned that Lumataw did not\n\nwarrant an exception to the one year asylum filing deadline as he\n\ndid not file his application within one-year of entering the United\n\nStates. However, in 1995, and for some years thereafter, there was\n\nno legal requirement that an alien file an asylum application\n\nwithin one year of entry -- a fact that neither the IJ nor BIA\n\nrecognized.    In fact, there was no deadline at all.     Thus, by\n\ncharging Lumataw for failing to file within one year of entry, the\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fIJ and BIA attributed years of delay to Lumataw for which he was\n\nnot legally responsible.        Lumataw argues that without even making\n\na finding of when he was legally required to file for asylum, the\n\nBIA   could    not   conduct   any    meaningful   analysis   of   whether   an\n\nexception was warranted.\n\n              Additionally, at his hearing before the IJ, Lumataw\n\nargued that because he had been included in his wife's January 2003\n\nI-589 application for asylum, it is the January 2003 date, rather\n\nthan the date of Lumataw's personal filing in 2005, that should be\n\ndeemed the governing time for analyzing whether an exception to the\n\none-year deadline applied.           The IJ, however, erred as a matter of\n\nlaw, Lumataw argues, in failing to consider Lumataw's inclusion in\n\nhis wife's 2003 application, noting only that petitioner filed ten\n\nyears after his 1995 initial entry.            Thus, the IJ's \"ten year\"\n\ncomment constitutes legal error, in that it shows the IJ was\n\nmistaken as to both the start date and end dates for analyzing\n\nwhether changed or extraordinary circumstances excuse Lumataw's\n\ndelay.   By adding years of additional delay to the analysis that\n\ndid not belong, Lumataw argues that as a matter of law, neither the\n\nIJ nor BIA conducted an appropriate one-year exception analysis.\n\n              The government does not dispute Lumataw's claims of\n\nerror, but argues that Lumataw is challenging the agency's factual\n\ndeterminations regarding timeliness, which we lack jurisdiction,\n\npursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(3), to review.             Recognizing that\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\flegal or constitutional questions are nevertheless reviewable on\n\nappeal, see 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D); Lutaaya v. Mukasey, 535 F.3d\n\n63, 69-70 (1st Cir. 2008), the government takes the position that\n\nLumataw's claims do not raise legal questions.         In support of its\n\nposition, the government relies on decisions of this court holding\n\nthat   agency   findings   regarding      timeliness   and   changed   or\n\nextraordinary circumstances are usually factual determinations\n\noutside this court's jurisdiction. See Hayek v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d\n\n501, 506-07 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n                  a.   Question of Law\n\n          The threshold issue is, thus, whether Lumataw has alleged\n\na reviewable \"question of law\" 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D), or rather,\n\na \"question of fact\" that is beyond our jurisdiction to review.\n\n          We have previously held that \"discretionary or factual\n\ndeterminations continue to fall outside [our] jurisdiction\" and\n\nthat \"BIA findings as to timeliness and changed circumstances are\n\nusually factual determinations.\"          See Hayek, 445 F.3d at 507\n\n(emphasis added & internal quotation marks omitted). However, this\n\ndoes not mean that this Court could never have jurisdiction over a\n\ntimeliness determination.    See    Liu v. INS, 508 F.3d 716, 721 (2d\n\nCir. 2007) (making this point).           Rather, \"[s]ome discretionary\n\ndeterminations do present underlying, reviewable questions of law.\"\n\nKhan v. Filip, 554 F.3d 681, 689 (7th Cir. 2009); see also Arif v.\n\nMukasey, 509 F.3d 677, 680 (5th Cir. 2007) (\"Although we have\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\fjurisdiction to review a determination of timeliness that turns on\n\na . . . question of law, we do not have jurisdiction to review\n\ndeterminations of timeliness that are based on findings of fact.\").\n\nThis is such a case.\n\n             A reviewable \"question of law\" may be raised where the\n\nagency used the \"wrong legal standard\" in coming to a determination\n\non a discretionary decision.           See Filip, 554 F.3d at 689; Liu, 508\n\nF.3d at 721; Khan v. Gonzales, 495 F.3d 31, 35 (2d Cir. 2007); see,\n\ne.g.,    Tariq    v.   Keisler,      505    F.3d   650,   656   (7th   Cir.   2007)\n\n(recognizing that we retain jurisdiction to determine whether the\n\nIJ   erred   in   requiring     \"exceptional       circumstances\"      instead     of\n\n\"extraordinary circumstances\").             Similarly, a reviewable \"question\n\nof law\" is raised where the agency is charged with misconstruing\n\nits own regulations in reaching a decision.                     See Rotinsulu v.\n\nMukasey, 515 F.3d 68, 72 (1st Cir. 2008) (explaining that \"[a]n\n\nagency has an obligation to abide by its own regulations\" and\n\n\"[t]he   failure       to   follow   an     applicable    regulation    may   be    a\n\nsufficient ground for vacation of an agency's decision, resulting\n\nin a remand\"); Cardoso-Tlaseca v. Gonzales, 460 F.3d 1102, 1103-04\n\n(9th Cir. 2006) (holding that the court had jurisdiction over\n\nalien's petition for review because the alien's claim that the BIA\n\nmisconstrued a regulation so as to bar his motion to reopen\n\npresented a question of law); see also H. Rep. 109-72, at 175-76\n\n(2006) (explaining in conference report on the REAL ID Act that use\n\n\n                                           -14-\n\fof the term \"question of law,\" as codified in § 1252(a)(2)(D)\n\nrefers to a \"question regarding the construction of a statute\").\n\n            We agree with Lumataw that the question of whether the IJ\n\nand BIA applied the correct filing deadline in assessing the\n\ntimeliness of his asylum application, constitutes a \"question of\n\nlaw\" underlying the agency's timeliness determinations.                    This is\n\nnot a case where the alien alleges that \"the agency got the facts\n\nwrong.\"     Usman v. Holder, 566 F.3d 262, 268 (1st Cir. 2009)\n\n(citations omitted).         The relevant facts, namely, the dates that\n\nLumataw entered the country and filed for asylum individually, and\n\nas part of his wife's application, are not in dispute.                 Nor does\n\nLumataw challenge the agency's exercise of its discretion in\n\ndetermining that no exception to the filing deadline was warranted.\n\nSee    Filip,   554   F.3d    at   687    (describing     determination      under\n\n§     1158(a)(2)(D)     as    to   whether      changed       or   extraordinary\n\ncircumstances justify filing delay as \"'inherently discretionary'\n\nand not reviewable\").         That analysis, Lumataw properly contends,\n\nmay only be conducted on remand.           See González v. Thomas, 547 U.S.\n\n183 (2006). Rather, at its core, the question underlying Lumataw's\n\nchallenge asks whether the agency misconstrued a statute, 8 U.S.C.\n\n§   1158(a)(2)(B),     and   its   own     regulation,    8   C.F.R.   §    1208.4\n\n(a)(2)(ii),     in    assessing    the    timeliness     of   Lumataw's     asylum\n\napplication.     See In re F-P-R-, 24 I & N at 685 (holding that IJ\n\n\"erred as a matter of law when he calculated the 1-year filing\n\n\n                                         -15-\n\fperiod on the basis of the respondent's prior arrival in the United\n\nStates in 1989 instead of the respondent's last arrival on July 20,\n\n2005\"   (emphasis    added)).     Thus,    we    hold      that   Lumataw      has\n\n\"identif[ied] a colorable, non-frivolous 'legal . . . defect in the\n\n[IJ and BIA's timeliness] decision[s]'\" that is within this court's\n\njurisdiction to review.         See Usman, 566 F.3d at 267 (quoting\n\nRashad, 554 F.3d at 5).\n\n           Upon   undertaking    such   review,       we   hold   that   the    IJ\n\ncommitted legal error when he faulted Lumataw for untimely filing\n\n\"10 years after he entered\" in 1995 without recognizing either the\n\nabsence of a filing deadline for the first few years of that\n\nperiod, or the undisputed record fact of Lumataw's inclusion in his\n\nwife's January 2003 asylum application.         Cf.    Arif, 509 F.3d at 680\n\n(suggesting   that    petitioner's      later-filed        individual    asylum\n\napplication would be timely if she had timely filed jointly with\n\nher husband, but holding that it lacked jurisdiction to review\n\nagency conclusion that petitioner failed to show by \"clear and\n\nconvincing evidence\" that prior joint application was filed within\n\none year of entry); 8 C.F.R. § 1208.4(a)(4)(i)(C) (citing \"[i]n the\n\ncase of an alien who had previously been included as a dependent in\n\nanother alien's pending asylum application,\" \"the loss of [that]\n\n. . . relationship\" as example of type of \"changed circumstance[]\"\n\nthat would warrant exception to one-year filing rule).\n\n\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\f          We further hold that the BIA committed legal error in\n\naffirming the IJ's determination of untimeliness on grounds that\n\nLumataw \"fail[ed] to file his application for asylum within 1 year\n\nof his arrival in the United States in 1995,\" where Lumataw's\n\napplication need only have been filed by April 1, 1998 in order to\n\nbe timely.   See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.4(a)(2)(ii) (explaining that the\n\n\"1-year period shall be calculated from the date of the alien's\n\nlast arrival in the United States or April 1, 1997, whichever is\n\nlater\" (emphasis added)).5\n\n                 b.    Harmless error\n\n          Despite legal error, we would be required to affirm the\n\nagency's rejection of Lumataw's asylum claim as untimely if the\n\nevidence nevertheless \"compel[led] a conclusion\" that Lumataw's\n\nasylum application was untimely and no exceptions to the filing\n\ndeadline applied.     Un v. Gonzales, 415 F.3d 205, 209 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (emphasis added) (holding that IJ's failure to address past\n\n\n5\n   The government cites Odmar as analogous to the instant case.\nSee Odmar v. Mukasey, 294 F.

The BIA\nfound that Odmar was ineligible for asylum because he failed to\nfile his application within the statutory one-year deadline and did\nnot establish any changed or extraordinary circumstances to excuse\nhis late filing.      In denying Odmar's appeal, we held that\n\"[d]eterminations of changed circumstances are generally factual\ndeterminations\" and that Odmar had failed to prove otherwise. Id.\nat 613. However, the crucial distinction between Odmar and this\ncase is that, in Odmar, there was no legal error found. It was\nbecause the agency's \"determination did not involve the application\nof an erroneous legal standard,\" that review was precluded. Id.\n\n                                -17-\n\fpersecution argument was not harmless error).6                 Because \"[w]e\n\ncannot say the evidence compels a conclusion either way,\" the error\n\ncannot   be    regarded    as   harmless.    Id.   (citing   El    Moraghy    v.\n\nAshcroft, 331 F.3d 195, 205 (1st Cir. 2003)).\n\n              Although    the   government   concedes   that      Lumataw    was\n\nrequired to file his application within one year of April 1, 1997\n\nrather than within one-year of his arrival in the United States,\n\nsee 8 C.F.R. § 1208.4(a)(2)(B)(ii), it is nevertheless undisputed\n\nthat Lumataw failed to filed his application by April 1, 1998 --\n\nthe proper asylum filing deadline applicable to him.                Therefore,\n\nthe government argues, the IJ and BIA properly found that Lumataw's\n\napplication was untimely and that no exceptions applied. Moreover,\n\nthe government argues, the BIA concluded that even considering\n\nLumataw's wife's 2003 filing, Lumataw nonetheless failed to timely\n\nfile for asylum.      Thus, the government suggests that any error in\n\nthe agency's articulation of the proper filing deadline and initial\n\nfiling date was harmless.\n\n\n6\n   We note that the kinds of errors previously found \"harmless\" in\nthe immigration context are more clearly non-prejudicial than the\nerror in this case. See, e.g., Mekhoukh v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 118,\n130 (1st Cir. 2004) (holding that omission of evidence that\n\"contains no information that materially affects the outcome of\n[the petitioner's] claims\" constitutes harmless error (emphasis\nadded)); Enwonwu v. Gonzales, 232 F. App'x 11, 14 (1st Cir. 2007)\n(stating error was harmless because it was \"not substantive\" when\nthe BIA mistakenly said, \"'[t]he respondent's appeal is\ndismissed,'\" when the BIA meant to say the petitioner's appeal was\nsustained); Rotinsulu, 515 F.3d at 73 (noting that \"material\ndeficiency in the BIA's decision . . . would have been harmless\"\nbecause claim was nevertheless definitively precluded).\n\n                                     -18-\n\f             At   first    blush,   the     government's   argument   carries\n\nsubstantial force.        After all, taking April 1, 1998 as the proper\n\ndate upon which Lumataw's one-year filing window expired, and\n\nJanuary 2003, the date of his wife's filing, as the date of\n\nLumataw's initial filing, Lumataw's application was nevertheless\n\nalmost five years late.       Lumataw argues, however, that by charging\n\nhim with failing to file within one year of his 1995 entry, when no\n\nsuch   requirement    existed,      and    omitting   consideration   of   his\n\ninclusion in his wife's 2003 application, the agency attributed to\n\nLumataw an additional five years of delay for which he was not\n\nlegally responsible.        The agency's legal errors, Lumataw argues,\n\nwhich caused it to incorrectly identify the two dates relevant to\n\na proper \"changed\" or \"extraordinary\" circumstances inquiry, meant\n\nthat the agency never engaged in a meaningful analysis of whether\n\nthe evidentiary record established circumstances that warranted an\n\nexception to the filing deadline.\n\n             Lumataw argues that, on remand, with the alleged legal\n\nerrors corrected, the record evidence supports a finding that\n\nchanged circumstances in Indonesia justify his delay in filing.\n\nSee 8 U.S.C. § 1158 (a)(2)(D).            Specifically, although the asylum\n\nfiling deadline applicable to him was April 1998, Lumataw argues\n\nthat   the   evidentiary     record   contains     extensive   documentation\n\nshowing that it was from the late 1990s into the early 2000s that\n\nconditions for Christians in Indonesia progressively deteriorated,\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\fa trend sparked by the overthrow of a long-time dictator who had\n\npreviously suppressed religious tensions.                   In support of his\n\nposition, Lumataw points to 2002 State Department Human Rights\n\nReports on the record, which show an increase in interreligious\n\nviolence   and    tension       in   Indonesia   in   the   period    immediately\n\npreceding his filing for asylum along with his wife. Specifically,\n\nthe State Department's Religious Freedom Report for 2001-2002\n\nacknowledged the substantial spike in violence in Indonesia during\n\nthis period.7      By including himself in his wife's January 2003\n\napplication, Lumataw argues, he can show that he filed his asylum\n\napplication      within     a    \"reasonable     time\"      after    the   changed\n\ncircumstances in Indonesia occurred.              See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.4(a)\n\n(4)(ii) (explaining that \"changed circumstances\" exception to one-\n\nyear asylum filing deadline applies if applicant files \"within a\n\nreasonable period\" given the \"changed circumstances\"); Husyev v.\n\n\n7\n           Religious intolerance increasingly was evident\n           during the period covered by this report, and\n           became a matter of growing concern to many\n           Indonesians. Apart from the violence in the\n           Moluccas and Central Sulawesi, religious\n           intolerance occasionally manifested itself\n           elsewhere in the country in the form of\n           attacks on churches. During the second half\n           of 2001, at least 30 churches were either\n           forcibly closed or destroyed in Sulawesi, West\n           Java, Jakarta, Yogyakart, Semarang, Aceh and\n           Buru Island.   There were no reports of any\n           mosques being destroyed during this period\n           covered by this report.\n\nU.S. State Dept. International Religious Freedom Report, Indonesia,\n2002.\n\n                                        -20-\n\fMukasey, 528 F.3d 1172, 1181 (9th Cir. 2008) (identifying the\n\nthreshold question for the one-year exception analysis as whether\n\nthe application was filed in a \"reasonable period\" after the\n\nchanged circumstances occurred).           Thus, the asylum claim would not\n\nbe time-barred.\n\n          Ultimately,      we    are    persuaded      by   Lumataw's    argument.\n\nAlthough admittedly a close question, we cannot confidently say\n\nthat this was a \"harmless error, which did not affect the outcome\n\nof the IJ's decision . . . .\"            Butt v. Keisler, 506 F.3d 86, 90\n\n(1st Cir. 2007).      Lumataw indisputably did not file his asylum\n\napplication by April 1, 1998, and thus, his application was in any\n\nevent untimely.      Yet, we conclude that by applying the proper\n\ntimeliness analysis, the agency is more likely to have found\n\ncircumstances that could excuse the untimely filing.\n\n          First,     in   terms    of     the   IJ's    failure   to     recognize\n\nLumataw's inclusion in his wife's application, we recognize that it\n\nwas just before the filing of that joint application in January\n\n2003 that the State Department human rights reports, part of the\n\nrecord before the agency, document an upsurge in interreligious\n\ntensions and violence in Indonesia. See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.4(a)(4)(i)\n\n(including changes in conditions in the applicant's country within\n\nthe   meaning   of   \"changed      circumstances\").            This     change   in\n\ncircumstances   could     be    found    to    have   \"materially     affect[ed]\"\n\nLumataw's eligibility for asylum, so as to excuse his late filing.\n\n\n                                        -21-\n\fSee id. (referring to \"circumstances materially affecting the\n\napplicant's eligibility for asylum\"); Kojo v. Holder, No. 04-73163,\n\n2009 WL 1396836, at *1 (9th Cir. 2009) (noting that \"worsening\n\nviolence towards Christians [in Indonesia] and the increasingly\n\nineffective response from the government . . .\" may constitute\n\nchanged conditions justifying [petitioner's] untimely application\"\n\nfor asylum, filed in 2002 rather than 1998, and remanding to IJ for\n\nappropriate determination).       Moreover, while what constitutes a\n\n\"reasonable time\" is nowhere defined with exactitude, at least two\n\nmembers of the BIA have suggested that, barring extraordinary\n\ncircumstances, \"'a reasonable period' for bringing an asylum claim\n\nbased on 'changed circumstances' is . . . 1 year from the point at\n\nwhich the circumstances changed.\"            In re G-C-L-, 23 I. & N. Dec.\n\n359, 364 (B.I.A. 2002) (Pauley, Board Member, dissenting).             This\n\nproposition of one year as a bench mark for what constitutes a\n\n\"reasonable time\" supports the notion that had Lumataw's 2003\n\nderivative application filing date been taken into account, in\n\nlight of the 2002 events in Indonesia, the agency could have found\n\nthat   Lumataw   filed   within   a    reasonable    time   after   \"changed\n\ncircumstances\" in Indonesia arose.\n\n           Moreover, even if the BIA is regarded as having partially\n\n\"corrected\" the IJ's error with respect to the non-consideration of\n\n\n\n\n                                      -22-\n\fthe 2003 derivative filing,8 it nevertheless perpetuated the IJ's\n\nerror regarding the filing deadline applicable to Lumataw, when it\n\ncited his failure to apply within one year of his 1995 arrival.9\n\nThus, the BIA's determination that no exceptions justified the\n\nuntimely filing was erroneously premised on an at least an eight-\n\nyear delay.   But as explained above, Lumataw cannot be charged, as\n\na matter of law, for the period of delay prior to the enactment of\n\nthe one-year filing deadline.\n\n          Ultimately,   the     question   of   whether   changed   or\n\nextraordinary circumstances exist to excuse an alien's failure to\n\nmeet the deadline for filing an asylum application is a highly\n\nfact-specific inquiry requiring an individualized analysis of the\n\nfacts of the particular case.    Matter of Y-C-, 23 I. & N. Dec. 286,\n\n287-88 (B.I.A. 2002).10 And, inevitably, justifying an eight or ten\n\n\n8\n   The BIA stated that \"[w]hile the respondent asserts that the\n[IJ] did not acknowledge that his wife filed an application in\n2003, which included the respondent, the respondent failed to\ndemonstrate that the [IJ's] omission of this fact supports a\nfinding that his failure to file his application for asylum within\n1 year of his arrival in the United States in 1995 should be\nexcused . . . .\" (emphasis added). This suggests that unlike the\nIJ, the BIA took the 2003 filing into account.        However, it\nnevertheless misstated the applicable filing deadline.\n9\n  To the extent that the BIA adopted the findings and reasoning of\nthe IJ, we review the decision of the IJ. Sukwanputra v. Gonzales,\n434 F.3d 627, 631 (3d Cir. 2006). Insofar as the BIA set forth its\nown opinion, however, we review its reasoning. Id.\n10\n   See also I.N.S. Asylum Officer Training Manual: One Year Filing\nDeadline         (Nov.        2001),        available          at\nhttp://www.asylumlaw.org/docs/united_states/asylum_officer_traini\nng_oneyear_112001.pdf (hereinafter \"AO Training Manual\").      The\n\n                                 -23-\n\fyear delay to the satisfaction of the agency is a more formidable\n\ntask than justifying a substantially shorter, five-year period of\n\ndelay.11    We cannot confidently say that the improper attribution\n\nof several additional years of delay to Lumataw was not the \"final\n\nstraw\"     precluding   the   BIA    from       exercising      its    discretion   in\n\nLumataw's    favor.     Moreover,        the    absence    of     an   asylum   filing\n\ndeadline at the time of Lumataw's initial entry and for several\n\nyears thereafter, if recognized, could have itself been considered\n\n\"extraordinary circumstances\" justifying a late filing.                         See 8\n\nC.F.R. § 1208.4(a)(5) (defining \"extraordinary circumstances\" as\n\n\"factors    directly    related     to    the    failure     to    meet   the   1-year\n\ndeadline\"); AO Training Manual, at 15-16 (instructing AO's, in\n\nconducting \"extraordinary circumstances\" analysis, to consider\n\n\"any . . . factor or group of factors\" which, \"depending on the\n\nfacts of the case\" \"produced a significant barrier to timely\n\n\nManual suggests that whether an exception justifies an untimely\nfiling is a fact-specific determination and instructs asylum\nofficers to ask whether \"a reasonable person under the same or\nsimilar circumstances as the applicant would have filed sooner.\"\nId. at 19.

Finally, also bearing in mind the canon which, given the\n\ndrastic    consequences           of   deportation,       favors    construction   of\n\nimmigration laws in the light most favorable to the alien12 we find\n\nthat we are unable confidently to conclude that had the agency\n\nconducted the proper timeliness analysis, it would not have found\n\nthat an exception justifying Lumataw's untimely filing applied.\n\nAnd had the untimely filing been excused, Lumataw would not have\n\nbeen precluded from demonstrating his eligibility for asylum.13\n\nThus, we cannot say that the agency's errors did not prejudice\n\nLumataw.        We leave it to the agency to determine upon remand\n\nwhether    or    not   the    application      of   the    proper    analysis   would\n\nnevertheless yield the same result.\n\n            In reaching this holding, we emphasize that we reach no\n\nconclusion as to whether, under the proper analysis, Lumataw's\n\nundisputed      failure      to    timely    file   his    application    should   be\n\nexcused.    Rather, because determinations regarding whether changed\n\nor extraordinary circumstances justify a late-filed application are\n\n\"generally factual determinations,\" Odmar, 294 F. App'x at 613, we\n\n\n12\n    See Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 449 (1987); Pacheco v.\nI.N.S., 546 F.2d 448, 449 (1st Cir. 1976) (citing Barber v.\nGonzales, 347 U.S. 637 (1954)); Fong Haw Tan v. Phelan, 333 U.S. 6,\n10 (1948).\n13\n   Although, in the course of its withholding of removal inquiry,\nthe agency found that Lumataw had not shown past persecution,\nbecause it also determined his asylum application to be untimely,\nit never evaluated whether Lumataw could qualify for asylum based\non a well-founded fear of future persecution.      See discussion\ninfra.\n\n                                            -25-\n\flack authority to make the discretionary determination in the first\n\ninstance of whether Lumataw in fact warrants an exception to the\n\none-year filing deadline.      What we recognize, however, is that the\n\nagency committed legal error in conducting its timeliness analysis,\n\nand a possibility exists that Lumataw might have satisfied 8 U.S.C.\n\n§   1158    (a)(2)(D)    but   for    the   IJ   and    BIA's   unambiguous\n\nmischaracterization of his filing obligations.           See Kojo, 2009 WL\n\n1396836, at *1 (granting petition to review and remanding because\n\n\"the IJ failed to analyze in the first instance whether changes in\n\nIndonesia    between    1998   and   2002   justify    the   untimely   filed\n\napplication\" for asylum).        Because we cannot conclude that the\n\nlegal errors raised by this appeal were harmless, we grant the\n\npetition for review and remand.\n\n            2.   Past Persecution\n\n            Lumataw argues that the agency erred in holding that he\n\nfailed to make out a claim of \"past persecution.\" Past persecution\n\ncan serve as the basis for either a withholding of removal or an\n\nasylum application.      See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.13(b), 1208.16(b).         The\n\nIJ and BIA found that the sole incident cited by Lumataw, even if\n\nmotivated by religious animus, did not rise to the level of past\n\npersecution.     See Matter of Acosta, 19 I. & N. Dec. 211, 216\n\n(B.I.A. 1985) (defining \"persecution\" as a \"threat to the life or\n\nfreedom of, or the infliction of suffering or harm upon, those who\n\ndiffer in a way regarded as offensive\").         Lumataw argues that this\n\n\n                                     -26-\n\fconclusion is contrary to the law in this circuit, which holds that\n\n\"credible threats can, depending on the circumstances, amount to\n\npersecution, especially when the assailant threatens the petitioner\n\nwith death, in person, and with a weapon.\"          Sok v. Mukasey, 526\n\nF.3d 48, 54 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n           Lumataw argues that he credibly testified that he was\n\nthreatened with death by a person with a knife on account of his\n\nChristian religion.     The agency so found.   But while Sok holds that\n\ncredible threats could constitute past persecution, whether that is\n\nactually   shown   in    any    particular   case   \"depend[s]   on   the\n\ncircumstances.\"    Id.         For example, we have held that \"hollow\n\nthreats . . . without more, certainly do not compel a finding of\n\npast persecution.\"       Ang v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 50, 56 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).   As the government accurately notes, the \"circumstances\" of\n\nSok are distinguishable from those in the instant case in that\n\nLumataw received only a single threat unaccompanied by physical\n\nharm, whereas Sok involved \"six separate instances in which [she]\n\nwas either threatened with death or serious injury . . . was beaten\n\nand detained, or was with her husband when he was threatened or\n\nbeaten.\"   Id.; see also Sompotan v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 63, 71 (1st\n\nCir. 2008) (noting that \"'the presence or absence of physical harm,\n\n(and, indeed, the degree of harm inflicted) remains a relevant\n\nfactor in determining whether mistreatment rises to the level of\n\n\n\n\n                                    -27-\n\fpersecution'\" (quoting Ruiz v. Mukasey, 526 F.3d 31, 37 (1st Cir.\n\n2008)).\n\n           Ultimately,    our    authority       to   disturb      the   agency's\n\ndetermination   is   constrained    by     our    deferential       \"substantial\n\nevidence\" standard of review \"which demands that we uphold the\n\nagency's determination unless the evidence points unerringly in the\n\nopposite direction.\" Rashad, 554 F.3d at 6 (quoting Khan, 549 F.3d\n\nat 576).   We cannot say on these facts that the \"record compels a\n\ncontrary   conclusion.\"      Elías-Zacarías,          502   U.S.    at   481   n.1\n\n(applying this standard and stating \"[t]o reverse the BIA finding\n\nwe must find that the evidence not only supports the conclusion,\n\nbut compels it\"); see also Arif, 509 F.3d at 680 (explaining that\n\n\"persecution is an extreme concept that does not include every sort\n\nof treatment our society regards as offensive\" (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted)).     We therefore, \"find no basis for disturbing [the\n\nIJ and BIA's] conclusion that the petitioner failed to show past\n\npersecution.\"    Nikijuluw v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 115, 121 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).\n\n           3.   Well-Founded Fear\n\n           Finally, Lumataw argues that even absent a favorable\n\nfinding on the past persecution question, on remand, Lumataw should\n\nbe entitled to present an asylum claim based on \"well-founded fear\n\nof future persecution.\"         We agree.        The IJ and BIA found that\n\nLumataw did not meet the standard for withholding of removal on the\n\n\n                                    -28-\n\fbasis   of   fear   of   future   persecution,   as   the   record   did   not\n\nestablish that Lumataw would \"more likely than not\" be persecuted\n\non the basis of his religion if he returned to Indonesia.             We hold\n\nthis decision to be supported by substantial evidence.               However,\n\nbecause Lumataw's asylum claim was dismissed as untimely, Lumataw's\n\nfear of future persecution claim was assessed only under the higher\n\nstandard of proof applicable to withholding of removal claims,\n\nrather than the asylum standard.        Pan, 489 F.3d at 86 (explaining\n\nthat \"'more likely than not' standard is harder for an alien to\n\nsatisfy than the 'reasonable possibility' standard for showing a\n\nwell-founded fear of future persecution in asylum cases\"); see also\n\nCardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. at 431 (finding in asylum context that\n\nten percent chance of being persecuted provides basis for \"well-\n\nfounded\" fear).      Lumataw argues that substantial evidence on the\n\nrecord, including various country conditions reports documenting a\n\ngrowing trend of intolerance against Christians in Indonesia, would\n\nsupport at least a ten percent possibility of future persecution if\n\nhe were removed.     We lack authority to evaluate this claim in the\n\nfirst instances.         But if, on remand, the IJ finds that Lumataw\n\nwarrants an exception to the one-year filing deadline, his asylum\n\nclaim on the basis of well-founded fear of future persecution in\n\nIndonesia must be revisited as well.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -29-\n\f                         III. Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we grant this petition for\n\njudicial review and remand.\n\n\n\n\n                              -30-\n\f",

We thus grant the instant petition and remand.\n\n                                 I.   Background\n\nA. Factual Background\n\n            Henderson M. Lumataw is a 35 year-old citizen and native\n\nof Indonesia.      He identifies himself as a Christian Protestant.\n\nThe incident upon which Lumataw's claim of past persecution is\n\npremised took place in Indonesia in August 1995.                   On that date,\n\nwhile traveling through Indonesia, Lumataw was accosted by a thief\n\nwho was subsequently joined by three additional attackers. Lumataw\n\nidentified these individuals as Muslims due to their headdresses\n\nand sarong attire.        Seeing the cross necklace around Lumataw's\n\nneck, one of the attackers accused Lumataw of being Christian. The\n\nattacker pointed a knife at Lumataw's neck and threatened to kill\n\nhim, saying \"I want to kill you Christian.\"                Ultimately, Lumataw\n\nescaped the attackers after they had robbed him of his cross\n\nnecklace. Lumataw was very shaken by the incident. Thereafter, he\n\nleft Indonesia for the United States.\n\n            Lumataw entered the United States on September 12, 1995\n\non a non-immigrant visitor with authorization to remain for six\n\nmonths.     According to Lumataw, he overstayed out of fear of being\n\nthreatened, tortured, or killed if he returned to Indonesia,\n\nbecause of his status as a Christian.            Lumataw explained, however,\n\nthat   he    did   not   apply    for   asylum     right    away    because   the\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\finterreligious conflict between Muslims and Christians was not as\n\nperilous in 1995 as it would later become.      Country conditions\n\nevidence on the record, including U.S. State Department Human\n\nRights Reports, confirms the increase in interreligious tensions in\n\nIndonesia in the late 1990s and early 2000s.   On October 5, 2002,\n\nin New Hampshire, Lumataw married Vonnie Golioth (\"Golioth\"), also\n\na Protestant Christian of Indonesian nationality.\n\nB.   Procedural History\n\n           On January 27, 2003, Golioth applied for asylum and\n\nLumataw was included in his wife's application. On April 11, 2003,\n\nthe Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") served him with a\n\nNotice to Appear (\"NTA\") charging him with being removable under 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B), as an alien who remained in the United\n\nStates for a time longer than permitted.   In 2005, Lumataw filed\n\nhis own application for asylum under § 208 of the Immigration and\n\nNationality Act (\"INA\"), and in the alternative, withholding of\n\nremoval under § 241(b)(3) of the INA and under the CAT.2\n\n           1.   The IJ Decision\n\n           On January 26, 2006 a hearing was held before an IJ on\n\nthe merits of Lumataw's application.     In addition to Lumataw's\n\ntestimony, Golioth also testified about incidents of violence and\n\n\n\n\n2\n   Lumataw had requested that the IJ consolidate his separate\nasylum application with his wife's application, but the request was\ndenied.\n\n                                  -4-\n\fintimidation inflicted on Christians by Muslims in Indonesia.                   The\n\nIJ issued an oral decision that day.\n\n           The IJ identified the \"timeliness\" of Lumataw's asylum\n\napplication as the threshold question for the court, noting that\n\nLumataw's asylum application was \"filed approximately 10 years\n\nafter he entered the United States.\"3            The IJ reasoned that \"while\n\nperiods   of    social   conflict    can      intervene   between   [Lumataw's]\n\narrival in the United States and the time he applied for asylum,\n\n[Lumataw] has not established that circumstances have changed to\n\nthe point where his eligibility for asylum has been materially\n\naffected.\"     Finding no evidence of \"a change in circumstances that\n\nwould justify a late filing in this case,\" the IJ held that\n\nLumataw's application for asylum was untimely.\n\n           As    to   the    material    aspects     of   Lumataw's      remaining\n\nwithholding of removal claim, the IJ found Lumataw to be generally\n\ncredible, but concluded that even if Lumataw's attackers were\n\nmotivated by animosity towards Christians, one isolated attack, far\n\nfrom   Lumataw's      home   or   workplace,     with     no   injury,    did   not\n\nconstitute     past   persecution.         Finding    that     Lumataw    had   not\n\nestablished past persecution, no presumption of future persecution\n\n\n\n3\n   As explained infra, normally, an asylum application must be\nfiled within one-year of an alien's arrival, unless he arrives\nprior to April 1, 1997, in which case, the filing deadline is one-\nyear from that date. See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B); 8 C.F.R.\n§ 1208.4(a)(2)(ii).      Exceptions do apply.       See 8 U.S.C.\n§ 1158(a)(2)(D).\n\n                                        -5-\n\fapplied either.     Furthermore, the IJ concluded that Lumataw could\n\nnot prove it was \"more likely than not\" that he would be persecuted\n\nif he returned to Indonesia, and thus, the IJ also denied his\n\napplication for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of\n\nthe INA.   The IJ also noted that country conditions in Indonesia do\n\nnot support the conclusion that Lumataw would \"more likely than\n\nnot\" be persecuted, should he be removed to Indonesia.           Lumataw's\n\napplication for CAT relief was also denied.              Finally, the IJ\n\nconcluded that Lumataw was eligible for voluntary departure.\n\n           2. The BIA Decision\n\n           On May 16, 2008, the BIA dismissed Lumataw's appeal.          On\n\nthe issue of timeliness, the BIA \"agree[d] with the [IJ] that\n\n[Lumataw] had failed to establish sufficient changed circumstances\n\nin Indonesia to excuse his failure to timely file his application\n\nfor asylum.\"    Although Lumataw had argued to the BIA that the IJ\n\nhad   failed   to   acknowledge   his   inclusion   in   his   wife's   2003\n\napplication, the BIA held that Lumataw \"failed to demonstrate that\n\nthe [IJ's] omission of this fact supports a finding that his\n\nfailure to file his application for asylum within one year of his\n\narrival in the United States in 1995 should be excused based on\n\nchanged circumstances in Indonesia.\"\n\n           As to the merits of Lumataw's alternative withholding of\n\nremoval claim, the BIA adopted the reasoning of the IJ that Lumataw\n\nhad failed to establish either past persecution or that he would\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\f\"more likely than not\" be persecuted in the future, so as to\n\nsupport withholding of removal.    The BIA also rejected his claims\n\nunder the CAT.\n\n           A timely petition for review in this court followed.   In\n\nthis petition Lumataw argues that the IJ and BIA erred as a matter\n\nof law in holding his asylum application to be untimely, as those\n\ndecisions rested on Lumataw's failure to file within one year of\n\nhis initial entry in 1995 when no filing deadline had yet been\n\nenacted into law, as well as a failure to consider his inclusion in\n\nhis wife's earlier-filed petition. Lumataw further argues that the\n\nIJ and BIA erred in ruling that Lumataw failed to make out a case\n\nof past persecution. Finally, Lumataw argues that should we remand\n\non the first issue, he should be entitled, on remand, to present an\n\nasylum claim based on \"well-founded fear of future persecution.\"\n\n                           II. Discussion\n\nA.   Applicable Law\n\n           \"To establish eligibility for asylum, an alien must prove\n\neither past persecution, which gives rise to an inference of future\n\npersecution, or establish a well founded fear of future persecution\n\non account of her race, religion, nationality, membership in a\n\nsocial group, or political opinion.\"    Hem v.

Petition for Review\n\n           1. Timeliness\n\n           Lumataw argues that the IJ and BIA erred as a matter of\n\nlaw in assessing the timeliness of his I-589 application for\n\nasylum.   This is because the BIA reasoned that Lumataw did not\n\nwarrant an exception to the one year asylum filing deadline as he\n\ndid not file his application within one-year of entering the United\n\nStates. However, in 1995, and for some years thereafter, there was\n\nno legal requirement that an alien file an asylum application\n\nwithin one year of entry -- a fact that neither the IJ nor BIA\n\nrecognized.    In fact, there was no deadline at all.     Thus, by\n\ncharging Lumataw for failing to file within one year of entry, the\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fIJ and BIA attributed years of delay to Lumataw for which he was\n\nnot legally responsible.        Lumataw argues that without even making\n\na finding of when he was legally required to file for asylum, the\n\nBIA   could    not   conduct   any    meaningful   analysis   of   whether   an\n\nexception was warranted.\n\n              Additionally, at his hearing before the IJ, Lumataw\n\nargued that because he had been included in his wife's January 2003\n\nI-589 application for asylum, it is the January 2003 date, rather\n\nthan the date of Lumataw's personal filing in 2005, that should be\n\ndeemed the governing time for analyzing whether an exception to the\n\none-year deadline applied.           The IJ, however, erred as a matter of\n\nlaw, Lumataw argues, in failing to consider Lumataw's inclusion in\n\nhis wife's 2003 application, noting only that petitioner filed ten\n\nyears after his 1995 initial entry.            Thus, the IJ's \"ten year\"\n\ncomment constitutes legal error, in that it shows the IJ was\n\nmistaken as to both the start date and end dates for analyzing\n\nwhether changed or extraordinary circumstances excuse Lumataw's\n\ndelay.   By adding years of additional delay to the analysis that\n\ndid not belong, Lumataw argues that as a matter of law, neither the\n\nIJ nor BIA conducted an appropriate one-year exception analysis.\n\n              The government does not dispute Lumataw's claims of\n\nerror, but argues that Lumataw is challenging the agency's factual\n\ndeterminations regarding timeliness, which we lack jurisdiction,\n\npursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(3), to review.             Recognizing that\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\flegal or constitutional questions are nevertheless reviewable on\n\nappeal, see 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D); Lutaaya v.

In support of its\n\nposition, the government relies on decisions of this court holding\n\nthat   agency   findings   regarding      timeliness   and   changed   or\n\nextraordinary circumstances are usually factual determinations\n\noutside this court's jurisdiction.

Question of Law\n\n          The threshold issue is, thus, whether Lumataw has alleged\n\na reviewable \"question of law\" 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D), or rather,\n\na \"question of fact\" that is beyond our jurisdiction to review.\n\n          We have previously held that \"discretionary or factual\n\ndeterminations continue to fall outside [our] jurisdiction\" and\n\nthat \"BIA findings as to timeliness and changed circumstances are\n\nusually factual determinations.\"          See Hayek, 445 F.3d at 507\n\n(emphasis added & internal quotation marks omitted).

Rather, at its core, the question underlying Lumataw's\n\nchallenge asks whether the agency misconstrued a statute, 8 U.S.C.\n\n§   1158(a)(2)(B),     and   its   own     regulation,    8   C.F.R.   §    1208.4\n\n(a)(2)(ii),     in    assessing    the    timeliness     of   Lumataw's     asylum\n\napplication.     See In re F-P-R-, 24 I & N at 685 (holding that IJ\n\n\"erred as a matter of law when he calculated the 1-year filing\n\n\n                                         -15-\n\fperiod on the basis of the respondent's prior arrival in the United\n\nStates in 1989 instead of the respondent's last arrival on July 20,\n\n2005\"   (emphasis    added)).     Thus,    we    hold      that   Lumataw      has\n\n\"identif[ied] a colorable, non-frivolous 'legal . . . defect in the\n\n[IJ and BIA's timeliness] decision[s]'\" that is within this court's\n\njurisdiction to review.

Moreover,\n\nthe government argues, the BIA concluded that even considering\n\nLumataw's wife's 2003 filing, Lumataw nonetheless failed to timely\n\nfile for asylum.      Thus, the government suggests that any error in\n\nthe agency's articulation of the proper filing deadline and initial\n\nfiling date was harmless.\n\n\n6\n   We note that the kinds of errors previously found \"harmless\" in\nthe immigration context are more clearly non-prejudicial than the\nerror in this case.

After all, taking April 1, 1998 as the proper\n\ndate upon which Lumataw's one-year filing window expired, and\n\nJanuary 2003, the date of his wife's filing, as the date of\n\nLumataw's initial filing, Lumataw's application was nevertheless\n\nalmost five years late.       Lumataw argues, however, that by charging\n\nhim with failing to file within one year of his 1995 entry, when no\n\nsuch   requirement    existed,      and    omitting   consideration   of   his\n\ninclusion in his wife's 2003 application, the agency attributed to\n\nLumataw an additional five years of delay for which he was not\n\nlegally responsible.        The agency's legal errors, Lumataw argues,\n\nwhich caused it to incorrectly identify the two dates relevant to\n\na proper \"changed\" or \"extraordinary\" circumstances inquiry, meant\n\nthat the agency never engaged in a meaningful analysis of whether\n\nthe evidentiary record established circumstances that warranted an\n\nexception to the filing deadline.\n\n             Lumataw argues that, on remand, with the alleged legal\n\nerrors corrected, the record evidence supports a finding that\n\nchanged circumstances in Indonesia justify his delay in filing.\n\nSee 8 U.S.C. § 1158 (a)(2)(D).            Specifically, although the asylum\n\nfiling deadline applicable to him was April 1998, Lumataw argues\n\nthat   the   evidentiary     record   contains     extensive   documentation\n\nshowing that it was from the late 1990s into the early 2000s that\n\nconditions for Christians in Indonesia progressively deteriorated,\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\fa trend sparked by the overthrow of a long-time dictator who had\n\npreviously suppressed religious tensions.                   In support of his\n\nposition, Lumataw points to 2002 State Department Human Rights\n\nReports on the record, which show an increase in interreligious\n\nviolence   and    tension       in   Indonesia   in   the   period    immediately\n\npreceding his filing for asylum along with his wife. Specifically,\n\nthe State Department's Religious Freedom Report for 2001-2002\n\nacknowledged the substantial spike in violence in Indonesia during\n\nthis period.7      By including himself in his wife's January 2003\n\napplication, Lumataw argues, he can show that he filed his asylum\n\napplication      within     a    \"reasonable     time\"      after    the   changed\n\ncircumstances in Indonesia occurred.              See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.4(a)\n\n(4)(ii) (explaining that \"changed circumstances\" exception to one-\n\nyear asylum filing deadline applies if applicant files \"within a\n\nreasonable period\" given the \"changed circumstances\"); Husyev v.\n\n\n7\n           Religious intolerance increasingly was evident\n           during the period covered by this report, and\n           became a matter of growing concern to many\n           Indonesians.

Yet, we conclude that by applying the proper\n\ntimeliness analysis, the agency is more likely to have found\n\ncircumstances that could excuse the untimely filing.\n\n          First,     in   terms    of     the   IJ's    failure   to     recognize\n\nLumataw's inclusion in his wife's application, we recognize that it\n\nwas just before the filing of that joint application in January\n\n2003 that the State Department human rights reports, part of the\n\nrecord before the agency, document an upsurge in interreligious\n\ntensions and violence in Indonesia.

Moreover, while what constitutes a\n\n\"reasonable time\" is nowhere defined with exactitude, at least two\n\nmembers of the BIA have suggested that, barring extraordinary\n\ncircumstances, \"'a reasonable period' for bringing an asylum claim\n\nbased on 'changed circumstances' is . . . 1 year from the point at\n\nwhich the circumstances changed.\"            In re G-C-L-, 23 I. & N. Dec.\n\n359, 364 (B.I.A. 2002) (Pauley, Board Member, dissenting).             This\n\nproposition of one year as a bench mark for what constitutes a\n\n\"reasonable time\" supports the notion that had Lumataw's 2003\n\nderivative application filing date been taken into account, in\n\nlight of the 2002 events in Indonesia, the agency could have found\n\nthat   Lumataw   filed   within   a    reasonable    time   after   \"changed\n\ncircumstances\" in Indonesia arose.\n\n           Moreover, even if the BIA is regarded as having partially\n\n\"corrected\" the IJ's error with respect to the non-consideration of\n\n\n\n\n                                      -22-\n\fthe 2003 derivative filing,8 it nevertheless perpetuated the IJ's\n\nerror regarding the filing deadline applicable to Lumataw, when it\n\ncited his failure to apply within one year of his 1995 arrival.9\n\nThus, the BIA's determination that no exceptions justified the\n\nuntimely filing was erroneously premised on an at least an eight-\n\nyear delay.   But as explained above, Lumataw cannot be charged, as\n\na matter of law, for the period of delay prior to the enactment of\n\nthe one-year filing deadline.\n\n          Ultimately,   the     question   of   whether   changed   or\n\nextraordinary circumstances exist to excuse an alien's failure to\n\nmeet the deadline for filing an asylum application is a highly\n\nfact-specific inquiry requiring an individualized analysis of the\n\nfacts of the particular case.

This suggests that unlike the\nIJ, the BIA took the 2003 filing into account.        However, it\nnevertheless misstated the applicable filing deadline.\n9\n  To the extent that the BIA adopted the findings and reasoning of\nthe IJ, we review the decision of the IJ. Sukwanputra v.

The\n\n                                 -23-\n\fyear delay to the satisfaction of the agency is a more formidable\n\ntask than justifying a substantially shorter, five-year period of\n\ndelay.11    We cannot confidently say that the improper attribution\n\nof several additional years of delay to Lumataw was not the \"final\n\nstraw\"     precluding   the   BIA    from       exercising      its    discretion   in\n\nLumataw's    favor.     Moreover,        the    absence    of     an   asylum   filing\n\ndeadline at the time of Lumataw's initial entry and for several\n\nyears thereafter, if recognized, could have itself been considered\n\n\"extraordinary circumstances\" justifying a late filing.                         See 8\n\nC.F.R. § 1208.4(a)(5) (defining \"extraordinary circumstances\" as\n\n\"factors    directly    related     to    the    failure     to    meet   the   1-year\n\ndeadline\"); AO Training Manual, at 15-16 (instructing AO's, in\n\nconducting \"extraordinary circumstances\" analysis, to consider\n\n\"any . . . factor or group of factors\" which, \"depending on the\n\nfacts of the case\" \"produced a significant barrier to timely\n\n\nManual suggests that whether an exception justifies an untimely\nfiling is a fact-specific determination and instructs asylum\nofficers to ask whether \"a reasonable person under the same or\nsimilar circumstances as the applicant would have filed sooner.\"\nId. at 19.

Mukasey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203303\"><a href=\"/opinion/203303/sok-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 54 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n           Lumataw argues that he credibly testified that he was\n\nthreatened with death by a person with a knife on account of his\n\nChristian religion.     The agency so found.   But while Sok holds that\n\ncredible threats could constitute past persecution, whether that is\n\nactually   shown   in    any    particular   case   \"depend[s]   on   the\n\ncircumstances.\"    Id.         For example, we have held that \"hollow\n\nthreats . . . without more, certainly do not compel a finding of\n\npast persecution.\"       Ang v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201939\"><a href=\"/opinion/201939/ang-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 56 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).   As the government accurately notes, the \"circumstances\" of\n\nSok are distinguishable from those in the instant case in that\n\nLumataw received only a single threat unaccompanied by physical\n\nharm, whereas Sok involved \"six separate instances in which [she]\n\nwas either threatened with death or serious injury . . . was beaten\n\nand detained, or was with her husband when he was threatened or\n\nbeaten.\"   Id.; see also Sompotan v. Mukasey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203395\"><a href=\"/opinion/203395/sompotan-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 71 (1st\n\nCir. 2008) (noting that \"'the presence or absence of physical harm,\n\n(and, indeed, the degree of harm inflicted) remains a relevant\n\nfactor in determining whether mistreatment rises to the level of\n\n\n\n\n                                    -27-\n\fpersecution'\" (quoting Ruiz v. Mukasey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203300\"><a href=\"/opinion/203300/ruiz-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 37 (1st Cir.\n\n2008)).\n\n           Ultimately,    our    authority       to   disturb      the   agency's\n\ndetermination   is   constrained    by     our    deferential       \"substantial\n\nevidence\" standard of review \"which demands that we uphold the\n\nagency's determination unless the evidence points unerringly in the\n\nopposite direction.\" Rashad, 554 F.3d at 6 (quoting Khan, 549 F.3d\n\nat 576).   We cannot say on these facts that the \"record compels a\n\ncontrary   conclusion.\"      Elías-Zacarías,          502   U.S.    at   481   n.1\n\n(applying this standard and stating \"[t]o reverse the BIA finding\n\nwe must find that the evidence not only supports the conclusion,\n\nbut compels it\"); see also Arif, 509 F.3d at 680 (explaining that\n\n\"persecution is an extreme concept that does not include every sort\n\nof treatment our society regards as offensive\" (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted)).     We therefore, \"find no basis for disturbing [the\n\nIJ and BIA's] conclusion that the petitioner failed to show past\n\npersecution.\"    Nikijuluw v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201886\"><a href=\"/opinion/201886/nikijuluw-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">115</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 121 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).\n\n           3.   Well-Founded Fear\n\n           Finally, Lumataw argues that even absent a favorable\n\nfinding on the past persecution question, on remand, Lumataw should\n\nbe entitled to present an asylum claim based on \"well-founded fear\n\nof future persecution.\"         We agree.        The IJ and BIA found that\n\nLumataw did not meet the standard for withholding of removal on the\n\n\n                                    -28-\n\fbasis   of   fear   of   future   persecution,   as   the   record   did   not\n\nestablish that Lumataw would \"more likely than not\" be persecuted\n\non the basis of his religion if he returned to Indonesia.             We hold\n\nthis decision to be supported by substantial evidence.               However,\n\nbecause Lumataw's asylum claim was dismissed as untimely, Lumataw's\n\nfear of future persecution claim was assessed only under the higher\n\nstandard of proof applicable to withholding of removal claims,\n\nrather than the asylum standard.        Pan, 489 F.3d at 86 (explaining\n\nthat \"'more likely than not' standard is harder for an alien to\n\nsatisfy than the 'reasonable possibility' standard for showing a\n\nwell-founded fear of future persecution in asylum cases\"); see also\n\nCardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. at 431 (finding in asylum context that\n\nten percent chance of being persecuted provides basis for \"well-\n\nfounded\" fear).      Lumataw argues that substantial evidence on the\n\nrecord, including various country conditions reports documenting a\n\ngrowing trend of intolerance against Christians in Indonesia, would\n\nsupport at least a ten percent possibility of future persecution if\n\nhe were removed.     We lack authority to evaluate this claim in the\n\nfirst instances.         But if, on remand, the IJ finds that Lumataw\n\nwarrants an exception to the one-year filing deadline, his asylum\n\nclaim on the basis of well-founded fear of future persecution in\n\nIndonesia must be revisited as well.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -29-\n\f                         III. Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we grant this petition for\n\njudicial review and remand.\n\n\n\n\n                              -30-\n\f</pre>",
