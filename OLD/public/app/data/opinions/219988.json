HERNÁNDEZ-MIRANDA,\n\n                      Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                               v.\n\n                   EMPRESAS DÍAZ MASSÓ, INC.,\n\n                      Defendant, Appellee.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                 FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n         [Hon. Francisco A. Besosa, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Lynch, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Siler,* Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Francisco M. López-Romo for appellant.\n     Anne Noel Occhialino, Attorney, with whom P. David Lopez,\nGeneral Counsel, Carolyn L. Wheeler, Acting Associate General\nCounsel, and Lorraine C. Davis, Assistant General Counsel, were on\nbrief, for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, amicus\ncuriae.\n     Miguel Simonet Sierra for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          June 29, 2011\n\n\n\n\n     *\n          Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f          LYNCH, Chief Judge.      This appeal raises questions of\n\nfirst impression for this circuit as to the proper interpretation\n\nof the caps on compensatory and punitive damages under 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1981a(b)(3) in a Title VII employment discrimination action.\n\n          The Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-166,\n\nauthorized the recovery of previously unavailable types of damages\n\nin Title VII actions involving intentional discrimination. Pub. L.\n\nNo. 102-166, § 102; 42 U.S.C. § 1981a(a)(1), (b). These additional\n\ntypes of damages, which can be awarded by verdict once a violation\n\nof Title VII has been established, were made available subject to\n\nthe proviso that they be capped.       The caps range from $50,000 to\n\n$300,000, and turn on how many employees a defendant \"has . . . in\n\neach of 20 or more calendar weeks in the current or preceding\n\ncalendar year.\"   42 U.S.C. § 1981a(b)(3).      The question presented\n\non appeal is whether the \"current\" calendar year refers to the\n\ncalendar year(s) in which the discrimination occurred or the\n\ncalendar year in which the damage award is made.\n\n          A jury awarded the plaintiff, Edna Hernández-Miranda,\n\n$300,000 in damages in this Title VII suit alleging intentional\n\ndiscrimination by her former employer, Empresas Díaz Massó (DM).\n\nHernández-Miranda   testified   that   during   her   employment   as   a\n\nconstruction worker, she was forced to perform oral sex on a\n\nsupervisor multiple times and was subjected to extreme, continuing\n\nsexual abuse by coworkers and supervisors.      She testified that her\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fjob with DM was her sole means to support herself and her children,\n\nand that as a result of the mistreatment she sought psychiatric\n\nhelp.    Hernández-Miranda testified as well that DM ignored her\n\nrepeated complaints of sexual harassment.\n\n             The district court reduced the jury award to $50,000\n\nunder § 1981a(b)(3)(A), using the year of the award to measure the\n\nnumber of DM's employees and thereby determine the size of the\n\napplicable statutory cap.        Miranda v. Empresas Díaz Massó, Inc.,\n\n699 F. Supp. 2d 413, 438 (D.P.R. 2010).        Hernández-Miranda appeals\n\nthis reduction with amicus support from the Equal Employment\n\nOpportunity Commission (EEOC), and we reverse.            We interpret the\n\nstatutory phrase \"current\" calendar year in § 1981a(b)(3) to refer\n\nto the time period of the discrimination.          Because DM has not shown\n\nthat    it   had   less   than   200   employees    during   the   years   of\n\ndiscrimination, we hold that the statutory cap in § 1981a(b)(3)(C)\n\napplies.     We remand with instructions to vacate the judgment of\n\n$50,000 and to enter a compensatory damages award of $200,000.\n\n                                       I.\n\n             Based on more than adequate evidence, the ugly details of\n\nwhich we do not describe further, the jury issued its award of\n\n$300,000 on August 18, 2008, \"to compensate for past, present and\n\nfuture emotional pain and mental anguish caused by [DM's] conduct,\n\nactions, or omissions.\"      Hernández-Miranda worked for DM, first as\n\na laborer and then as a Safety Officer at labor sites, from August\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\f2003 until her termination in March 2005.             The evidence at trial\n\nestablished    that    the    clearest        incidents      of   harassment,\n\ndiscrimination, and abuse occurred in 2004.\n\n          DM   filed   several    motions     after   the    jury's    verdict,\n\nincluding an August 26, 2008 motion under Rule 59(e) to reduce the\n\nverdict based on § 1981a(b)(3).           This motion asserted that the\n\ncurrent calendar year, for purposes of the damage cap provision, is\n\nthe calendar year of judgment.       DM accompanied the motion with an\n\naffidavit signed by its vice-president, which stated that in 2007\n\nDM employed 98 employees and in 2008, the year of the award, DM\n\nemployed only 25 employees.       The affidavit made clear that DM's\n\nworkforce had shrunk since the period of discrimination, from 241\n\nemployees in 2003 and 247 employees in 2004.\n\n          Hernández-Miranda      filed    a   garbled     opposition    to   the\n\nmotion to reduce the award.      She argued that DM had failed to offer\n\nevidence at trial concerning how many employees it had, and that\n\nthe court had prevented her from doing so.                  Hernández-Miranda\n\nfurther asserted that DM had recently merged with another company\n\nand that the resulting company had 1,300 employees. She also noted\n\nthat there had been testimony at trial that DM at one time had 250\n\nto 300 employers. Hernández-Miranda did not address which of these\n\nnumbers should guide the damage cap analysis.1\n\n\n     1\n          Hernández-Miranda does raise this issue of statutory\ninterpretation on appeal, and we exercise our discretion to excuse\nany waiver. See Powell v. Alexander, 391 F.3d 1, 21 n.24 (1st Cir.\n\n                                    -4-\n\f              Without     discussion,       the   district      court       assumed    the\n\nrelevant time period for determining the damage cap was the time of\n\nthe   entry    of   the    verdict    and    reduced   the      award       to    $50,000.\n\nMiranda, 699 F. Supp. 2d at 437-38.\n\n                                         II.\n\n              We review a district court's ruling on a motion to alter\n\nor amend the judgment for abuse of discretion, Negrón-Almeda v.\n\nSantiago, 528 F.3d 15, 25 (1st Cir. 2008), reviewing questions of\n\nlaw de novo and questions of fact for clear error, Ungar v.\n\nPalestine     Liberation      Org.,   599     F.3d   79,   83    (1st       Cir.    2010).\n\nQuestions of statutory interpretation are questions of law and are\n\nreviewed de novo.         United States v. Troy, 618 F.3d 27, 35 (1st Cir.\n\n2010).\n\n              Before the Civil Rights Act of 1991, successful Title VII\n\nlitigants could receive damages for back pay, limited to the pay\n\nfor   the     two   years     prior     to     the   filing      of     a    charge     of\n\ndiscrimination.         42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(g)(1).              The 1991 Act newly\n\nmade punitive damages available under the statute, as well as\n\nadditional forms of compensatory damages: non-pecuniary damages and\n\nfuture pecuniary damages.             Id. § 1981a(a)(1) & (b).                   These new\n\nremedies were made available to Title VII litigants who proved\n\nintentional discrimination, but not Title VII litigants who proved\n\n\n\n2004). We do so \"in the interests of justice.\"                   Thomas v. Arn, 474\nU.S. 140, 155 & n.15 (1985).\n\n                                         -5-\n\fthat an employment practice was unlawful only because of its\n\ndisparate impact.   Id. § 1981a(a)(1).      The remedies were made\n\navailable subject to statutory damage caps.2\n\n          Neither the Supreme Court nor this court has addressed\n\nthe meaning of \"current\" calendar year under § 1981a(b)(3). We are\n\nonly aware of three circuits that have done so.      The Fourth and\n\nFifth Circuits, and, by implication, the Seventh Circuit have\n\nconcluded that the \"current\" calendar year under § 1981a(b)(3) is\n\nthe year of discrimination.    Depaoli v. Vacation Sales Assocs.,\n\nLLC, 489 F.3d 615, 622 (4th Cir. 2007); Vance v. Union Planters\n\nCorp., 209 F.3d 438, 446 (5th Cir. 2000); Hennessey v. Penril\n\nDatacomm Networks, Inc., 69 F.3d 1344, 1354-55 (7th Cir. 1995).\n\n          In so holding, the Fourth and Fifth Circuits relied in\n\npart on language in 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(b).      That provision limits\n\nthe definition of \"employer\" under Title VII to a person with\n\nfifteen or more employees \"in each of twenty or more calendar weeks\n\nin the current or preceding calendar year.\"    42 U.S.C. § 2000e(b).\n\nThe two courts held that the current year under § 2000e(b) is the\n\nyear of the discrimination, and that consistent usage dictates that\n\nthe current year under § 1981a(b)(3) also be the year of the\n\n\n\n\n     2\n          To be clear, the caps do not apply to         the damages\npreviously available under Title VII. See 42 U.S.C. §   1981a(b)(2).\nNor do they apply to awards pursuant to state           law claims.\nRodriguez-Torres v. Caribbean Forms Mfr., Inc., 399      F.3d 52, 65\n(1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                               -6-\n\fdiscrimination.      See Depaoli, 489 F.3d at 622; Vance, 209 F.3d at\n\n446.\n\n            The    Supreme    Court   has    implicitly   reached   the   same\n\nconclusion about the meaning of \"current\" calendar year under\n\n§ 2000e(b).       In Walters v. Metropolitan Educational Enterprises,\n\nInc., 519 U.S. 202 (1997), the Court applied that provision such\n\nthat the \"current\" calendar year is the year of the discrimination.\n\nWalters, 519 U.S. at 205 & n.*.        This court interpreted § 2000e(b)\n\nin this fashion in Vera-Lozano v. International Broadcasting, 50\n\nF.3d 67 (1st Cir. 1995).        There, we held that \"the 'current year'\n\n. . . as defined by the statute\" under § 2000e(b) was the year of\n\nthe discrimination.          Id. at 69 (citing Dumas v. Town of Mount\n\nVernon, Ala., 612 F.3d 974, 979 n.4 (5th Cir. 1980)).\n\n                                      III.\n\n            Under settled principles of statutory construction, we\n\nfirst look to whether the statutory text is plain and unambiguous.\n\nCarcieri v. Salazar, 129 S. Ct. 1058, 1063 (2009).            If it is, \"we\n\nmust apply the statute according to its terms.\"             Id. at 1063-64.\n\nIn conducting this analysis, we begin with the ordinary meaning of\n\nthe terms as of the time when the statutory provision was enacted.\n\nSee id. at 1064.       To determine ordinary meaning, we may consult\n\ndictionary definitions, interpretations given to the same terms by\n\njudicial construction, and the statutory context in which the words\n\nare used.    See id.\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f          The language of § 1981a(b)(3) provides:\n\n          The sum of the amount of compensatory damages\n          awarded under this section . . . and the\n          amount of punitive damages awarded under this\n          section,   shall    not  exceed,   for   each\n          complaining party--\n\n          (A) in the case of a respondent who has more\n          than 14 and fewer than 101 employees in each\n          of 20 or more calendar weeks in the current or\n          preceding calendar year, $50,000;\n\n          (B) in the case of a respondent who has more\n          than 100 and fewer than 201 employees in each\n          of 20 or more calendar weeks in the current or\n          preceding calendar year, $100,000; and\n\n          (C) in the case of a respondent who has more\n          than 200 and fewer than 501 employees in each\n          of 20 or more calendar weeks in the current or\n          preceding calendar year, $200,000; and\n\n          (D) in the case of a respondent who has more\n          than 500 employees in each of 20 or more\n          calendar weeks in the current or preceding\n          calendar year, $300,000.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1981a(b)(3).\n\n          The sparse legislative history of the 1991 amendments\n\nreflect that this provision arose from a political compromise\n\nbetween those who wanted to broaden the availability of damages\n\nunder Title VII3 and the Americans with Disabilities Act and those\n\nconcerned that an expansion of remedies under these statutes might\n\n\n     3\n          The expansion of Title VII remedies also equalized the\nremedies available to Title VII gender discrimination plaintiffs\nwith those that had previously been available under § 1981 to\nracial discrimination plaintiffs. Compare 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(g)\nwith 42 U.S.C. § 1981; see also Bryan Hart, Comment, Burden of\nProof for Employee Numerosity under § 1981a Statutory Damage Caps,\n75 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1657, 1661 (2008).\n\n                               -8-\n\fresult in frivolous litigation and awards that posed economic\n\nperils to businesses.          This compromise is made clear by the two\n\nprimary interpretive memoranda discussing the Act.                  See 137 Cong.\n\nRec. S15,472-78 (daily ed. Oct. 30, 1991) (statement of Sen. Robert\n\nDole); id. at 15,483-85 (statement of Sen. John Danforth).                     The\n\nlegislative history does not speak directly to how the phrase\n\n\"current   or    preceding     calendar      year\"   should    be    interpreted,\n\nhowever.\n\n           DM argues that the text is plain and that the term\n\n\"current\" means \"presently elapsing\" or \"occurring in or existing\n\nin the present time.\"      Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 306\n\n(11th   ed.     2003);   see    also   Carcieri,      129     S.    Ct.   at   1064\n\n(interpreting the term \"now\" in the Indian Reorganization Act). DM\n\nargues that since the caps cannot be applied until there has been\n\na verdict award, the \"current\" calendar year must mean the year of\n\nthe award.      It also argues that this reading gives effect to a\n\ncongressional intent to spare small employers from large awards, as\n\nemployers that shrunk in size would be protected from awards capped\n\non the basis of their size at an earlier date.\n\n           Though DM's plain meaning argument is far from frivolous,\n\nwe reject it for several reasons.             In our view, these dictionary\n\ndefinitions cannot resolve the issue on appeal. The issue turns on\n\nfrom what point in time one should read the term \"current,\" not on\n\nthe abstract meaning of that term.             On its face, the damage caps\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fprovision does not resolve this question; in our view, it can be\n\nreasonably    construed   in   different     ways.     To   best   effectuate\n\ncongressional intent, we look both to the context of the larger\n\nstatutory scheme and to how the phrase \"current or preceding\n\ncalendar year\" had been defined elsewhere in the statutory scheme\n\nat the time Congress enacted the 1991 amendments to Title VII.\n\nA.           The Statutory Scheme\n\n             The damages cap applies to the sum of punitive damages\n\nand compensatory damages made available by the 1991 Act. See Hogan\n\nv. Bangor & Aroostook R.R. Co., 61 F.3d 1034, 1037 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\nThe   caps    apply   individually    to    each   party,   see    42   U.S.C.\n\n§ 1981a(b)(3), and are for the court, not the jury, to apply, see\n\nid. § 1981a(c)(2).      The statute forbids the court from informing\n\nthe jury of the limitations on recovery.           Id. § 1981a(c)(2).     From\n\nthe legislative history, it is clear that juries are not advised of\n\nthe cap to ensure that \"no pressure, upward or downward, will be\n\nexerted on the amount of jury awards by the existence of the\n\nstatutory limitations.\" 137 Cong. Rec. S15,484 (daily ed. Oct. 30,\n\n1991) (statement of Sen. John Danforth).             Of necessity, the caps\n\ncome into play only after there has been a verdict award.4\n\n\n\n\n      4\n          Nonetheless, it is not uncommon for evidence as to the\nemployer's size to be introduced at trial, as was true in part\nhere. See, e.g., Hennessy v. Penril Datacomm Networks, Inc., 69\nF.3d 1344, 1354 (7th Cir. 1995).\n\n                                     -10-\n\f           It   is   clear    that     Congress   did    intend   to   protect\n\nemployers,   especially      smaller    employers,   from    ruinously   large\n\nawards, and that the size of the employer was used as a rough\n\nmeasure for the degree of protection needed.                Congress designed\n\nremedies under Title VII to be somewhat proportionate to ability to\n\npay.   The number of employees a company has serves as a proxy for\n\nthis ability.    Smaller employers face smaller penalties; larger\n\nemployers face larger penalties.         This general principle, however,\n\ndoes not dispose of the issue in this case.             Congress, we believe,\n\nintended such protection for those who were small employers at the\n\ntime of the discrimination, and not those who by happenstance or\n\ndesign became smaller employers between the time of discrimination\n\nand the time of the verdict.\n\n           This construction best serves Title VII's purpose of\n\nencouraging resolution of disputes before litigation commences.\n\nThis purpose is one reason for the requirement of an EEOC filing\n\nprior to the filing of a lawsuit, see Local No. 93, Int'l Assoc. of\n\nFirefighters, AFL-CIO C.L.C., v. City of Cleveland, 478 U.S. 501,\n\n517-18 (1986), and is best advanced by providing clarity and\n\ncertainty as to the size of potential damage awards from the outset\n\nof a dispute.   The new types of damages made available in the 1991\n\nAct are inherently more difficult to value precisely than the back\n\npay damages traditionally available under Title VII, rendering this\n\n\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\ftype of clarity and certainty all the more important in allowing\n\nlitigants to make informed decisions about settlement.\n\n             Clarity and certainty of potential liability also allows\n\nfor both sides to set realistic litigation budgets and evaluate\n\nwhether cases are worth bringing and defending.             Such clarity and\n\ncertainty allows businesses to set adequate reserves, disclose\n\nthose reserves in annual reports as necessary, and make assessments\n\nabout    whether    and   how   much   to     insure   against   the   risk   of\n\nlitigation.5    It also provides appropriate incentives to employers\n\nto take measures for affirmative defenses under Faragher v. City of\n\nBoca Raton, 524 U.S. 775 (1998), and Burlington Industries, Inc. v.\n\nEllerth, 524 U.S. 742 (1998), should a dispute arise.\n\n             We stress clarity and certainty because only one of the\n\noffered interpretations provides them.            There is no early clarity\n\nor certainty under DM's reading.              When cases get scheduled for\n\ntrial is up to the court system, and delay will vary with case\n\nload.      Interpreting the \"current\" calendar year as the years of\n\ndiscrimination, by contrast, provides clarity and certainty even\n\nbefore the lawsuit is filed, and serves the purpose of the 1991 Act\n\nof providing compensatory, but not excessive, awards. In addition,\n\nas   the    Vance   court   sagely      recognized,     using    the   year   of\n\ndiscrimination prevents employers from \"engag[ing] in gamesmanship\n\n\n\n     5\n          Or at least to insure against the risk of compensatory\ndamages, as most insurers will not indemnify punitive damages.\n\n                                       -12-\n\fby structuring companies, or timing the progress of lawsuits, to\n\nmaximize gain or to minimize loss.\"             Vance, 209 F.3d at 446.\n\nB.          Preexisting Judicial Constructions\n\n            This construction of the statute is supported by pre-1991\n\njudicial constructions of § 2000e(b), the Title VII provision that\n\nalso employs the phrase \"current or preceding calendar year.\" Like\n\nthe Fourth and Fifth Circuits, we think the meaning of \"current\"\n\ncalendar year under § 2000e(b) is relevant to the meaning of\n\n\"current\" calendar year under § 1981(a)(b)(3).                See Depaoli, 489\n\nF.3d at 622; Vance, 209 F.3d at 446.             This parallel provision of\n\nTitle    VII,   which   preexisted   the     1991   amendments,     limits     the\n\ndefinition of \"employer\" under Title VII to persons with fifteen or\n\nmore    employees   during   a   period    of    weeks   in   the   \"current    or\n\npreceding calendar year.\"        42 U.S.C. § 2000e(b).\n\n            DM argues that the identical language in § 2000e(b) and\n\n§ 1981a(b)(3) need not be construed identically because the two\n\nsections operate at different stages of a Title VII case and serve\n\ndifferent purposes.      The § 2000e(b) question comes up at the start\n\nof a case and determines whether a plaintiff has satisfied an\n\nelement of stating a claim under Title VII.              See Arbaugh v. Y & H\n\nCorp., 546 U.S. 500, 516 (2006).            By contrast, the § 1981a(b)(3)\n\nquestion comes up at the end of a case and has nothing to do with\n\nwhether the plaintiff stated a claim under the Act.             DM argues that\n\nthe purpose of § 1981a(b)(3) is to avoid jury verdicts that would\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fdrive employers into bankruptcy, and argues that this purpose is\n\nbest served by its interpretation of that provision.6\n\n            Contrary to DM's assertions, § 2000e(b) and § 1981a(b)(3)\n\nhave in common a purpose to prevent ruinous verdicts against small\n\nemployers.     In Clackamas Gastroenterology Associates, P.C. v.\n\nWells, 538 U.S. 440 (2003), the Supreme Court noted that Congress's\n\ndecision to limit the definition of an \"employer\" in Title VII and\n\nother anti-discrimination statutes to a person with fifteen or more\n\nemployees reflected its intent to limit both liability and the\n\ncosts of compliance and litigation for very small firms.             Id. at\n\n444 & n.3, 446-47.       It is true that § 1981a(b)(3) provides\n\nprotections even for larger employers, but at the very least it\n\nshares a common purpose with § 2000e(b) with respect to small\n\nemployers. In addressing larger employers, moreover, § 1981a(b)(3)\n\neffectuates a notion that employers should not be liable for\n\nruinous   awards   consistent   with   the   narrower   limitation    in   §\n\n2000e(b).\n\n            When Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1991, the\n\nphrase \"current or preceding calendar year\" had been construed in\n\n\n     6\n          DM quotes from comments of Senator Dale Bumpers during\nthe Senate floor debate prior to passage.      See 137 Cong. Rec.\nS15,479 (daily ed. Oct. 30, 1991).      These comments evidence a\nconcern about protecting small employers, but they do not convey\ninformation about the separate issue of when to measure the size of\nan employer. Further, the views of individual members of Congress\nare not dispositive on issues of statutory interpretation. See\nPosters 'N' Things, Ltd. v. United States, 511 U.S. 513, 522 n.12\n(1994).\n\n                                  -14-\n\fthe Title VII context.           Although there was no Supreme Court\n\ndecision on point at the time, there was ample case law construing\n\n\"current\" calendar year under § 2000e(b) as the year of the\n\ndiscrimination.     See, e.g., Davis v. W. Cmty. Hosp., 786 F.2d 677,\n\n681 (5th Cir. 1986); McGraw v. Warren Cnty. Oil Co., 707 F.2d 990,\n\n991 (8th Cir. 1983); Dumas, 612 F.2d at 979 n.4, overruled on other\n\ngrounds by Larkin v. Pullman-Standard Div., Pullman, Inc., 854 F.2d\n\n1549, 1569 (11th Cir. 1988); Slack v. Havens, 522 F.2d 1091, 1093\n\n(9th Cir. 1975); see also Komorowski v. Townline Mini-Mart & Rest.,\n\n162   F.3d   962,   965   (7th   Cir.   1998)   (noting   that   \"[c]ourts\n\nconsistently have held that the phrase 'current calendar year'\n\nrefers to the year in which the alleged discrimination occurred,\"\n\nand citing cases, including cases prior to the 1991 Act).\n\n             The understanding of a term employed by Congress is\n\nordinarily determined as of the time of enactment.         See Carcieri,\n\n129 S. Ct. at 1064.        Terms \"that have acquired a specialized\n\nmeaning in the legal context must be accorded their legal meaning.\"\n\nBuckhannon Bd. & Care Home, Inc. v. W. Va. Dep't of Health & Human\n\nRes., 532 U.S. 598, 615 (2001) (Scalia, J., concurring).          Congress\n\nis presumed to know judicial interpretations of statutory terms as\n\nof the time it amends statutes.      See id. at 615-16; Cannon v. Univ.\n\nof Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 696-98 (1979). In addition, under normal\n\nrules of statutory construction, \"identical words used in different\n\nparts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning.\"\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\fDep't of Revenue of Ore. v. ACF Indus., 510 U.S. 332, 342 (1994)\n\n(quoting Sorenson v. Sec'y of Treasury, 475 U.S. 851, 860 (1986))\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n              The fact that Congress used the same terminology in the\n\n1991 amendments as in § 2000e(b) makes it quite likely, under\n\nnormal canons of statutory interpretation, that it intended to\n\nadopt   the    year   of   discrimination    as    the    \"current\"    year   in\n\n§ 1981a(b)(3). As the Fourth Circuit has noted, the two provisions\n\nare   interdependent.       See   Depaoli,   489   F.3d    at   622   (\"Reading\n\n§§ 1981a(b)(3) and 2000e(b) together, it becomes apparent that the\n\nreason § 1981(b)(3) provides no damage cap for employers with less\n\nthan 15 employees is that such employers are presumed to be exempt\n\nfrom Title VII's requirements by virtue of § 2000e(b).\").               Indeed,\n\nif the \"current\" calendar year under § 2000e(b) referred to the\n\nyear of the discrimination and the \"current\" calendar year under\n\n§ 1981a(b)(3) referred to the year of judgment, employers with more\n\nthat fifteen employees at the start of the litigation but less than\n\nfifteen employees at the time of judgment could be liable for\n\nuncapped damages.       See id. at 622.      This could not be Congress's\n\nintent given its stated interest in protecting small employers from\n\nruinous awards.       See Wells, 538 U.S. at 444 n.3, 446-47.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\f                                      IV.\n\n            Having concluded that the \"current\" year for purposes of\n\n§ 1981a(b)(3) refers to the year of the discrimination, we may\n\nquickly dispose of two subsidiary issues.\n\n            First, DM makes a mild protest that even under this\n\nconstruction of § 1981a(b)(3), the damage reduction should be\n\nupheld because there is no definitive evidence of record as to the\n\nnumber of employees it had at the time of discrimination.               Under\n\nthe logic of Concrete Pipe & Products of Cal., Inc. v. Construction\n\nLaborers Pension Trust for S. Cal., 508 U.S. 602 (1993), however,\n\nit is DM who bears the burden of establishing the prerequisites for\n\ncapping the award. Neither the text nor the legislative history of\n\n§ 1981a(b)(3) speaks to who bears the burden of showing the\n\nrelevant number of employees, but due process concerns and the\n\ntraditional burden of proof dictate that the defendant employer\n\nbear the burdens of production and persuasion on the caps.          See id.\n\nat 628-30.\n\n            The applicability of the caps is not an element of the\n\nTitle    VII    claim.      Instead,     the   defendant     employer   must\n\naffirmatively move to impose the cap and to present relevant\n\nevidence.      Cf. Schaffer ex rel. Schaffer v. Weast, 546 U.S. 49, 57\n\n(2005)   (burden    of   persuasion    may   appropriately   be   placed   on\n\ndefendant to prove affirmative defenses or exemptions); see also\n\nMashpee Tribe v. New Seabury Corp., 592 F.2d 575, 589 (1st Cir.\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\f1979)       (\"[N]ormally   the   party    asserting   the   affirmative   of    a\n\nproposition should bear the burden of proving that proposition.\").\n\nMoreover, the \"ordinary rule, based on considerations of fairness,\n\ndoes not place the burden upon a litigant of establishing facts\n\npeculiarly within the knowledge of his adversary.\"              Schaffer, 546\n\nU.S. at 60 (quoting United States v. N.Y., N.H. & H.R. Co., 355\n\nU.S. 253, 256 n.5 (1957)) (internal quotation marks omitted).                  It\n\nis clear that employers are in the best position to establish how\n\nmany employees they have at a given time.7\n\n               Second, Hernández-Miranda asks that the case be remanded\n\nto allow reinstatement of the full $300,000 award on the theory\n\nthat it can be applied to a pendent claim of discrimination under\n\nPuerto Rican law.          The district court held that this state law\n\nclaim had been abandoned pretrial and we agree.\n\n               The judgment is vacated and the case is remanded for\n\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion; to wit, reduction\n\nof the jury award to $200,000.            Costs are awarded to plaintiff.\n\n               So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n        7\n          As DM has not introduced any evidence concerning how many\nemployees it had in 2002, we look only to the evidence it\nintroduced with respect to 2003 and 2004.\n\n                                         -18-\n\f",

This appeal raises questions of\n\nfirst impression for this circuit as to the proper interpretation\n\nof the caps on compensatory and punitive damages under 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1981a(b)(3) in a Title VII employment discrimination action.\n\n          The Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-166,\n\nauthorized the recovery of previously unavailable types of damages\n\nin Title VII actions involving intentional discrimination. Pub. L.\n\nNo. 102-166, § 102; 42 U.S.C. § 1981a(a)(1), (b). These additional\n\ntypes of damages, which can be awarded by verdict once a violation\n\nof Title VII has been established, were made available subject to\n\nthe proviso that they be capped.       The caps range from $50,000 to\n\n$300,000, and turn on how many employees a defendant \"has . . . in\n\neach of 20 or more calendar weeks in the current or preceding\n\ncalendar year.\"   42 U.S.C. § 1981a(b)(3).      The question presented\n\non appeal is whether the \"current\" calendar year refers to the\n\ncalendar year(s) in which the discrimination occurred or the\n\ncalendar year in which the damage award is made.\n\n          A jury awarded the plaintiff, Edna Hernández-Miranda,\n\n$300,000 in damages in this Title VII suit alleging intentional\n\ndiscrimination by her former employer, Empresas Díaz Massó (DM).\n\nHernández-Miranda   testified   that   during   her   employment   as   a\n\nconstruction worker, she was forced to perform oral sex on a\n\nsupervisor multiple times and was subjected to extreme, continuing\n\nsexual abuse by coworkers and supervisors.      She testified that her\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fjob with DM was her sole means to support herself and her children,\n\nand that as a result of the mistreatment she sought psychiatric\n\nhelp.    Hernández-Miranda testified as well that DM ignored her\n\nrepeated complaints of sexual harassment.\n\n             The district court reduced the jury award to $50,000\n\nunder § 1981a(b)(3)(A), using the year of the award to measure the\n\nnumber of DM's employees and thereby determine the size of the\n\napplicable statutory cap.

Hernández-Miranda appeals\n\nthis reduction with amicus support from the Equal Employment\n\nOpportunity Commission (EEOC), and we reverse.            We interpret the\n\nstatutory phrase \"current\" calendar year in § 1981a(b)(3) to refer\n\nto the time period of the discrimination.          Because DM has not shown\n\nthat    it   had   less   than   200   employees    during   the   years   of\n\ndiscrimination, we hold that the statutory cap in § 1981a(b)(3)(C)\n\napplies.     We remand with instructions to vacate the judgment of\n\n$50,000 and to enter a compensatory damages award of $200,000.\n\n                                       I.\n\n             Based on more than adequate evidence, the ugly details of\n\nwhich we do not describe further, the jury issued its award of\n\n$300,000 on August 18, 2008, \"to compensate for past, present and\n\nfuture emotional pain and mental anguish caused by [DM's] conduct,\n\nactions, or omissions.\"      Hernández-Miranda worked for DM, first as\n\na laborer and then as a Safety Officer at labor sites, from August\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\f2003 until her termination in March 2005.             The evidence at trial\n\nestablished    that    the    clearest        incidents      of   harassment,\n\ndiscrimination, and abuse occurred in 2004.\n\n          DM   filed   several    motions     after   the    jury's    verdict,\n\nincluding an August 26, 2008 motion under Rule 59(e) to reduce the\n\nverdict based on § 1981a(b)(3).           This motion asserted that the\n\ncurrent calendar year, for purposes of the damage cap provision, is\n\nthe calendar year of judgment.       DM accompanied the motion with an\n\naffidavit signed by its vice-president, which stated that in 2007\n\nDM employed 98 employees and in 2008, the year of the award, DM\n\nemployed only 25 employees.       The affidavit made clear that DM's\n\nworkforce had shrunk since the period of discrimination, from 241\n\nemployees in 2003 and 247 employees in 2004.\n\n          Hernández-Miranda      filed    a   garbled     opposition    to   the\n\nmotion to reduce the award.      She argued that DM had failed to offer\n\nevidence at trial concerning how many employees it had, and that\n\nthe court had prevented her from doing so.                  Hernández-Miranda\n\nfurther asserted that DM had recently merged with another company\n\nand that the resulting company had 1,300 employees. She also noted\n\nthat there had been testimony at trial that DM at one time had 250\n\nto 300 employers. Hernández-Miranda did not address which of these\n\nnumbers should guide the damage cap analysis.1\n\n\n     1\n          Hernández-Miranda does raise this issue of statutory\ninterpretation on appeal, and we exercise our discretion to excuse\nany waiver.

This compromise is made clear by the two\n\nprimary interpretive memoranda discussing the Act.                  See 137 Cong.\n\nRec. S15,472-78 (daily ed. Oct. 30, 1991) (statement of Sen. Robert\n\nDole); id. at 15,483-85 (statement of Sen. John Danforth).                     The\n\nlegislative history does not speak directly to how the phrase\n\n\"current   or    preceding     calendar      year\"   should    be    interpreted,\n\nhowever.\n\n           DM argues that the text is plain and that the term\n\n\"current\" means \"presently elapsing\" or \"occurring in or existing\n\nin the present time.\"      Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 306\n\n(11th   ed.     2003);   see    also   Carcieri,      129     S.    Ct.   at   1064\n\n(interpreting the term \"now\" in the Indian Reorganization Act). DM\n\nargues that since the caps cannot be applied until there has been\n\na verdict award, the \"current\" calendar year must mean the year of\n\nthe award.      It also argues that this reading gives effect to a\n\ncongressional intent to spare small employers from large awards, as\n\nemployers that shrunk in size would be protected from awards capped\n\non the basis of their size at an earlier date.\n\n           Though DM's plain meaning argument is far from frivolous,\n\nwe reject it for several reasons.             In our view, these dictionary\n\ndefinitions cannot resolve the issue on appeal. The issue turns on\n\nfrom what point in time one should read the term \"current,\" not on\n\nthe abstract meaning of that term.             On its face, the damage caps\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fprovision does not resolve this question; in our view, it can be\n\nreasonably    construed   in   different     ways.     To   best   effectuate\n\ncongressional intent, we look both to the context of the larger\n\nstatutory scheme and to how the phrase \"current or preceding\n\ncalendar year\" had been defined elsewhere in the statutory scheme\n\nat the time Congress enacted the 1991 amendments to Title VII.\n\nA.           The Statutory Scheme\n\n             The damages cap applies to the sum of punitive damages\n\nand compensatory damages made available by the 1991 Act. See Hogan\n\nv. Bangor & Aroostook R.R. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"701264\"><a href=\"/opinion/701264/donald-hogan-v-bangor-and-aroostook-railroad-company-donald-hogan-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1034</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1037 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\nThe   caps    apply   individually    to    each   party,   see    42   U.S.C.\n\n§ 1981a(b)(3), and are for the court, not the jury, to apply, see\n\nid. § 1981a(c)(2).      The statute forbids the court from informing\n\nthe jury of the limitations on recovery.           Id. § 1981a(c)(2).     From\n\nthe legislative history, it is clear that juries are not advised of\n\nthe cap to ensure that \"no pressure, upward or downward, will be\n\nexerted on the amount of jury awards by the existence of the\n\nstatutory limitations.\" 137 Cong. Rec. S15,484 (daily ed. Oct. 30,\n\n1991) (statement of Sen. John Danforth).             Of necessity, the caps\n\ncome into play only after there has been a verdict award.4\n\n\n\n\n      4\n          Nonetheless, it is not uncommon for evidence as to the\nemployer's size to be introduced at trial, as was true in part\nhere. See, e.g., Hennessy v. Penril Datacomm Networks, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"707611\"><a href=\"/opinion/707611/patricia-hennessy-v-penril-datacomm-networks-incorporated-and-richard/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1344</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1354 (7th Cir. 1995).\n\n                                     -10-\n\f           It   is   clear    that     Congress   did    intend   to   protect\n\nemployers,   especially      smaller    employers,   from    ruinously   large\n\nawards, and that the size of the employer was used as a rough\n\nmeasure for the degree of protection needed.                Congress designed\n\nremedies under Title VII to be somewhat proportionate to ability to\n\npay.   The number of employees a company has serves as a proxy for\n\nthis ability.    Smaller employers face smaller penalties; larger\n\nemployers face larger penalties.         This general principle, however,\n\ndoes not dispose of the issue in this case.             Congress, we believe,\n\nintended such protection for those who were small employers at the\n\ntime of the discrimination, and not those who by happenstance or\n\ndesign became smaller employers between the time of discrimination\n\nand the time of the verdict.\n\n           This construction best serves Title VII's purpose of\n\nencouraging resolution of disputes before litigation commences.\n\nThis purpose is one reason for the requirement of an EEOC filing\n\nprior to the filing of a lawsuit, see Local No. 93, Int'l Assoc. of\n\nFirefighters, AFL-CIO C.L.C., v. City of Cleveland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111748\"><a href=\"/opinion/111748/firefighters-v-cleveland/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">501</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n517-18 (1986), and is best advanced by providing clarity and\n\ncertainty as to the size of potential damage awards from the outset\n\nof a dispute.   The new types of damages made available in the 1991\n\nAct are inherently more difficult to value precisely than the back\n\npay damages traditionally available under Title VII, rendering this\n\n\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\ftype of clarity and certainty all the more important in allowing\n\nlitigants to make informed decisions about settlement.\n\n             Clarity and certainty of potential liability also allows\n\nfor both sides to set realistic litigation budgets and evaluate\n\nwhether cases are worth bringing and defending.             Such clarity and\n\ncertainty allows businesses to set adequate reserves, disclose\n\nthose reserves in annual reports as necessary, and make assessments\n\nabout    whether    and   how   much   to     insure   against   the   risk   of\n\nlitigation.5    It also provides appropriate incentives to employers\n\nto take measures for affirmative defenses under Faragher v.

There is no early clarity\n\nor certainty under DM's reading.              When cases get scheduled for\n\ntrial is up to the court system, and delay will vary with case\n\nload.      Interpreting the \"current\" calendar year as the years of\n\ndiscrimination, by contrast, provides clarity and certainty even\n\nbefore the lawsuit is filed, and serves the purpose of the 1991 Act\n\nof providing compensatory, but not excessive, awards. In addition,\n\nas   the    Vance   court   sagely      recognized,     using    the   year   of\n\ndiscrimination prevents employers from \"engag[ing] in gamesmanship\n\n\n\n     5\n          Or at least to insure against the risk of compensatory\ndamages, as most insurers will not indemnify punitive damages.\n\n                                       -12-\n\fby structuring companies, or timing the progress of lawsuits, to\n\nmaximize gain or to minimize loss.\"             Vance, 209 F.3d at 446.\n\nB.          Preexisting Judicial Constructions\n\n            This construction of the statute is supported by pre-1991\n\njudicial constructions of § 2000e(b), the Title VII provision that\n\nalso employs the phrase \"current or preceding calendar year.\" Like\n\nthe Fourth and Fifth Circuits, we think the meaning of \"current\"\n\ncalendar year under § 2000e(b) is relevant to the meaning of\n\n\"current\" calendar year under § 1981(a)(b)(3).                See Depaoli, 489\n\nF.3d at 622; Vance, 209 F.3d at 446.             This parallel provision of\n\nTitle    VII,   which   preexisted   the     1991   amendments,     limits     the\n\ndefinition of \"employer\" under Title VII to persons with fifteen or\n\nmore    employees   during   a   period    of    weeks   in   the   \"current    or\n\npreceding calendar year.\"        42 U.S.C. § 2000e(b).\n\n            DM argues that the identical language in § 2000e(b) and\n\n§ 1981a(b)(3) need not be construed identically because the two\n\nsections operate at different stages of a Title VII case and serve\n\ndifferent purposes.      The § 2000e(b) question comes up at the start\n\nof a case and determines whether a plaintiff has satisfied an\n\nelement of stating a claim under Title VII.              See Arbaugh v. Y & H\n\nCorp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145677\"><a href=\"/opinion/145677/arbaugh-v-y-h-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">500</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 516 (2006).            By contrast, the § 1981a(b)(3)\n\nquestion comes up at the end of a case and has nothing to do with\n\nwhether the plaintiff stated a claim under the Act.             DM argues that\n\nthe purpose of § 1981a(b)(3) is to avoid jury verdicts that would\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fdrive employers into bankruptcy, and argues that this purpose is\n\nbest served by its interpretation of that provision.6\n\n            Contrary to DM's assertions, § 2000e(b) and § 1981a(b)(3)\n\nhave in common a purpose to prevent ruinous verdicts against small\n\nemployers.

Id. at\n\n444 & n.3, 446-47.       It is true that § 1981a(b)(3) provides\n\nprotections even for larger employers, but at the very least it\n\nshares a common purpose with § 2000e(b) with respect to small\n\nemployers. In addressing larger employers, moreover, § 1981a(b)(3)\n\neffectuates a notion that employers should not be liable for\n\nruinous   awards   consistent   with   the   narrower   limitation    in   §\n\n2000e(b).\n\n            When Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1991, the\n\nphrase \"current or preceding calendar year\" had been construed in\n\n\n     6\n          DM quotes from comments of Senator Dale Bumpers during\nthe Senate floor debate prior to passage.      See 137 Cong. Rec.\nS15,479 (daily ed. Oct. 30, 1991).      These comments evidence a\nconcern about protecting small employers, but they do not convey\ninformation about the separate issue of when to measure the size of\nan employer.

As the Fourth Circuit has noted, the two provisions\n\nare   interdependent.       See   Depaoli,   489   F.3d    at   622   (\"Reading\n\n§§ 1981a(b)(3) and 2000e(b) together, it becomes apparent that the\n\nreason § 1981(b)(3) provides no damage cap for employers with less\n\nthan 15 employees is that such employers are presumed to be exempt\n\nfrom Title VII's requirements by virtue of § 2000e(b).\").               Indeed,\n\nif the \"current\" calendar year under § 2000e(b) referred to the\n\nyear of the discrimination and the \"current\" calendar year under\n\n§ 1981a(b)(3) referred to the year of judgment, employers with more\n\nthat fifteen employees at the start of the litigation but less than\n\nfifteen employees at the time of judgment could be liable for\n\nuncapped damages.       See id. at 622.      This could not be Congress's\n\nintent given its stated interest in protecting small employers from\n\nruinous awards.       See Wells, 538 U.S. at 444 n.3, 446-47.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\f                                      IV.\n\n            Having concluded that the \"current\" year for purposes of\n\n§ 1981a(b)(3) refers to the year of the discrimination, we may\n\nquickly dispose of two subsidiary issues.\n\n            First, DM makes a mild protest that even under this\n\nconstruction of § 1981a(b)(3), the damage reduction should be\n\nupheld because there is no definitive evidence of record as to the\n\nnumber of employees it had at the time of discrimination.               Under\n\nthe logic of Concrete Pipe & Products of Cal., Inc. v. Construction\n\nLaborers Pension Trust for S. Cal., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112883\"><a href=\"/opinion/112883/concrete-pipe-products-of-cal-inc-v-construction-laborers-pension/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">602</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1993), however,\n\nit is DM who bears the burden of establishing the prerequisites for\n\ncapping the award. Neither the text nor the legislative history of\n\n§ 1981a(b)(3) speaks to who bears the burden of showing the\n\nrelevant number of employees, but due process concerns and the\n\ntraditional burden of proof dictate that the defendant employer\n\nbear the burdens of production and persuasion on the caps.          See id.\n\nat 628-30.\n\n            The applicability of the caps is not an element of the\n\nTitle    VII    claim.      Instead,     the   defendant     employer   must\n\naffirmatively move to impose the cap and to present relevant\n\nevidence.      Cf. Schaffer ex rel. Schaffer v.
