Defendant Hospital Interamericano\n\nde Medicina Avanzada (\"HIMA\") appeals from a jury verdict finding\n\nthat it was negligent in monitoring the birth of Fabiola Rodríguez\n\nMarcano and that its negligence caused Fabiola severe and permanent\n\nneurological damage.      HIMA argues that there was insufficient\n\nevidence to establish its liability and that the evidence showed\n\ninstead that Dr. Pedro Roldán Millan (\"Dr. Roldán\"), the non-\n\nemployee obstetrician who delivered Fabiola, was solely responsible\n\nfor Fabiola's injuries.       HIMA further claims that the district\n\ncourt erred in allowing testimony by one of the plaintiffs' experts\n\nand in not remitting the damages award or awarding a new trial on\n\napportionment of liability.     We affirm.\n\n                                     I.\n\nA.         Factual background\n\n           We take the facts from the trial record, reciting them in\n\nthe light most favorable to the verdict.         See Grajales-Romero v.\n\nAm. Airlines, 194 F.3d 288, 292 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n           On the morning of September 14, 2000, plaintiff María\n\nMarcano Rivera (\"Marcano\") was admitted to HIMA, a hospital in\n\nCaguas, Puerto Rico, pursuant to her obstetrician's decision to\n\ninduce labor. The obstetrician, Dr. Roldán, was not an employee of\n\nHIMA but had privileges there.\n\n           At 10 a.m., HIMA nurses attached Marcano to a fetal\n\nmonitor,   which   monitors   both   the   fetus's   heart   rate   and   the\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fmother's uterine contractions.    A fetal monitor provides a digital\n\ndisplay of the fetal heart rate and prints out a paper record,\n\nknown as a tracing, of the heart rate and the contractions.     HIMA\n\nprotocol dictates that nurses check the fetal monitor and record\n\nthe fetal heart rate every 15 minutes during high-risk deliveries,\n\nincluding induced labor.     HIMA protocol also provides that the\n\nnurse monitoring the delivery is responsible for notifying the\n\nphysician of any abnormal fetal heart rate or uterine contraction\n\nfindings.\n\n            At 11:45 a.m., Dr. Roldán induced labor by simultaneously\n\nadministering Oxytocin through an intravenous drip and inserting in\n\nMarcano's vagina a 100 mcg tablet of Cytotec from his personal\n\nsupply.   Dr. Roldán's simultaneous administration of the two drugs\n\nwas contrary to HIMA protocol and medical standards established by\n\nthe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (\"ACOG\").\n\nBoth Oxytocin and Cytotec stimulate uterine contractions; together\n\nthey have a multiplier effect and can produce contractions that are\n\ntoo intense or too close together, thereby decreasing the flow of\n\noxygen to the fetus.     ACOG thus recommends a four-hour waiting\n\nperiod between administering Oxytocin and Cytotec.     Moreover, the\n\nrecommended dose of Cytotec -- when taken alone -- is only 25 mcg.\n\nThe higher 100 mcg dose administered by Dr. Roldán also risks\n\nproducing contractions which are too intense or too close together.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f            Shortly after Dr. Roldán administered the drugs, he left\n\nMarcano's room.    Marcano soon began to feel intense contractions.\n\nAlthough she rang the nurse call button repeatedly, the nurse\n\nmonitoring the delivery, Brenda Marrero, did not respond.\n\n            When   Marcano's      husband,     Jorge      Rodríguez       Matos\n\n(\"Rodríguez\"), joined her at approximately 2:30 p.m., he found her\n\nin a desperate state because of frequent contractions.              She told\n\nhim that the contractions were not like the ones she experienced\n\nwith the delivery of her first child and that she could not stand\n\nthe pain.   Rodríguez went to the nurses' station and asked them to\n\nsummon Dr. Roldán.       At approximately 2:45, Dr. Roldán returned to\n\nMarcano's   room   and    administered    Demerol,   a   pain   killer.     He\n\nremained in the room throughout the rest of the delivery.\n\n            Oddly, the tracing from the fetal heart rate monitor is\n\nmissing for the period between 10 a.m. and 3:27 p.m., meaning there\n\nis no way to evaluate the fetus's heart rate and oxygen supply\n\nwhile Marcano was alone in her hospital room.1           The tracing between\n\n\n     1\n      The record does include a form that purports to be Nurse\nMarrero's recording of the fetal heart rate every 30 minutes based\non the monitor's digital display. However, the plaintiffs' expert\nquestioned the accuracy of the entries on the form, testifying at\ntrial that\n     the frequency of the registered fetal heart rates was\n     inadequate because it was every 30 minutes [instead of\n     every 15 minutes as dictated by HIMA protocol], but the\n     fetal heart rates which are registered in this form . . .\n     are totally out of context with regards not only to the\n     part of the fetal heart rate tracing which we did get an\n     opportunity to evaluate, but [also] of the catastrophic\n     condition of the baby when she was born. This is like\n\n                                    -4-\n\f3:27 p.m. and 3:45 p.m. appears normal, but that reading does not\n\npreclude the possibility that the fetus was deprived of oxygen\n\nduring the period for which the tracing is missing.          Between 3:45\n\np.m. and 5 p.m., the tracing reveals a continuing pattern of\n\ncontractions   that   were   too    intense   and   too   close   together,\n\naccompanied by a low fetal heart rate.        These factors suggest that\n\nthe fetus was not receiving sufficient oxygen. The tracing ends at\n\napproximately 5 p.m., when Marcano was transferred to the delivery\n\nroom and the monitor was disconnected.\n\n            Baby Fabiola was born at 6:19 p.m.             She was taken\n\nimmediately to the neonatal intensive care unit, where she was\n\ndiagnosed with neonatal asphyxia and seizures secondary to neonatal\n\nasphyxia, and where she spent approximately two weeks before being\n\ndischarged to her parents.         Marcano and Rodríguez did not learn\n\nuntil four months later that Fabiola had permanent neurological\n\ndamage as a result of neonatal asphyxia.            Fabiola continues to\n\nsuffer from daily seizures, and her prognosis is grim.             Although\n\nshe has an anticipated life span of 45 years, she will never see,\n\nwalk, or communicate, and will require a caregiver for the rest of\n\nher life.\n\n\n\n\n     another patient, another labor and delivery.         This\n     registers perfectly normal fetal heart tones . . . [that]\n     are totally out of context with the clinical picture.\n\n                                    -5-\n\fB.                Procedural history\n\n                  On January 16, 2002, the plaintiffs sued Dr. Roldán and\n\nHIMA2 in federal district court for medical malpractice resulting\n\nin severe neurological damage to Fabiola. Early in the litigation,\n\nthe plaintiffs reached a settlement with Dr. Roldán, who is no\n\nlonger       in    practice.        Their      malpractice      claims   against       HIMA\n\nproceeded to trial in October 2003, principally on the theory that\n\nHIMA       employees       failed   to    adequately     monitor     the     labor     and\n\nchildbirth process and that HIMA's failure contributed to Fabiola's\n\ninjuries.3           Specifically,       the    plaintiffs       suggested      that   the\n\nneurological damage occurred during the period for which the\n\ntracing is missing, and that regular monitoring would have alerted\n\nDr. Roldán to Fabiola's distress in enough time to avert permanent\n\ndamage.\n\n                  Following a five-day trial, the jury returned a verdict\n\nin favor of the plaintiffs.               The jury found that both HIMA and Dr.\n\nRoldán       had    been    negligent    and     that   their    negligence      was   the\n\nproximate          cause    of   the     plaintiffs'      damages.         It    awarded\n\n$5.5 million in damages, apportioning 47% of the liability to HIMA\n\nand 53% of the liability to Dr. Roldán.                      Accordingly, the court\n\n\n\n       2\n           HIMA is also known as Centro Médico del Turabo, Inc.\n       3\n      Because Dr. Roldán was not an employee of HIMA, the hospital\nis not vicariously liable for his negligence during the delivery\nprocess. Its liability is limited to the acts and omissions of its\nown employees –- here, the nursing staff.\n\n                                            -6-\n\fentered judgment against HIMA for $2.585 million (i.e., 47% of $5.5\n\nmillion). The court subsequently denied HIMA's post-verdict motion\n\nfor judgment as a matter of law, a new trial on apportionment of\n\nliability, or remittitur.\n\n                                II.\n\n          HIMA raises several arguments on appeal.          First, it\n\nasserts that the district court erred in denying its motion for\n\njudgment as a matter of law pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 50.     Second, it assigns error to the district court's\n\ndecision to admit testimony by one of the plaintiffs' expert\n\nwitnesses.   Finally, HIMA contends that the district court abused\n\nits discretion in failing to grant its motion for a new trial or\n\nremittitur under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59.       We consider\n\nthese claims in turn.\n\nA.        Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law\n\n          While    conceding   that   Fabiola   suffered     permanent\n\nneurological damage during birth, HIMA argues that the evidence at\n\ntrial was insufficient to allow a reasonable jury to conclude that\n\nthe damage was causally linked to negligent monitoring.            The\n\ndistrict court rejected this argument in denying a post-verdict\n\nmotion for judgment as a matter of law, concluding that\n\n     there was ample evidence presented to the jury, which if\n     believed, could sustain a finding that HIMA was indeed\n     negligent in monitoring plaintiff's labor and that said\n     negligence proximately caused the alleged injuries. . . .\n     [T]he jury heard evidence that the monitoring was done\n     every thirty minutes as opposed to every 15 minutes, as\n\n                                -7-\n\f     was standard in induced labors. Most importantly, the\n     jury was allowed to make reasonable inferences from the\n     fact that a significant portion of the tracing of the\n     fetal heart rate and uterine contractions monitoring\n     machine was missing, and HIMA was unable to give any\n     explanation therefor.\n\n           A party seeking to overturn a jury verdict faces an\n\nuphill battle.    \"Courts may only grant a judgment contravening a\n\njury's determination when the evidence points so strongly and\n\noverwhelmingly in favor of the moving party that no reasonable jury\n\ncould have returned a verdict adverse to that party.\"                    Rivera\n\nCastillo   v.   AutoKirey,   Inc.,   379   F.3d   4,   9   (1st   Cir.    2004)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). We review de novo the district\n\ncourt's denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law, viewing\n\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\n\nTapalian v. Tusino, 377 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n           The substantive law of Puerto Rico governs this diversity\n\nsuit.   See Rojas-Ithier v. Sociedad Española de Auxilio Mutuo y\n\nBeneficiencia de P.R., 394 F.3d 40, 43 (1st Cir. 2005).           To prevail\n\non a medical malpractice claim under Puerto Rico law, \"a party must\n\nestablish (1) the duty owed; (2) an act or omission transgressing\n\nthat duty; and (3) a sufficient causal nexus between the breach and\n\nthe harm.\"      Id.   HIMA cites deficiencies in the plaintiffs’\n\nevidence as to both the first and third prongs of this test.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\f           1. Duty\n\n           Puerto Rico courts have explained the standard of care\n\nowed to patients as \"[t]hat [level of care] which, recognizing the\n\nmodern means of communication and education, . . . meets the\n\nprofessional requirements generally acknowledged by the medical\n\nprofession.\"       Lama v. Borras, 16 F.3d 473, 478 (1st Cir. 1994)\n\n(quoting Oliveros v. Abreu, 101 P.R. Dec. 209, 226 (1973)).                The\n\nstandard is a national one, and ordinarily must be demonstrated\n\nthrough expert testimony.      Id.\n\n           Here,    the   plaintiffs’      expert,   Dr.   Jose   Juan   Gorrín\n\nPeralta   (“Dr.    Gorrín”),   explained     that    the   standard   of   care\n\nrequires monitoring high-risk deliveries, including induced labor,\n\nevery 15 minutes.      Monitoring includes evaluating both the fetal\n\nheart rate and uterine contraction information provided by the\n\nfetal monitor’s paper tracings and the fetal heart rate information\n\nprovided by the fetal monitor’s digital display.             Monitoring is a\n\nshared responsibility of the doctor and the nurse; when the doctor\n\nis not present, the nurse is in charge of the monitoring.                  Dr.\n\nGorrín’s testimony on this point was corroborated by HIMA's expert,\n\nDr. José Vargas Cordero, who testified that when the doctor is not\n\npresent, the nurse is in charge of checking both the tracing and\n\nthe digital monitor, and that if the nurse notices an abnormal\n\nreading, she must call the doctor.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\f            There was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that\n\nHIMA failed to monitor Marcano's labor in accordance with the\n\nnational standard of care.         It is undisputed that Nurse Marrero\n\nchecked the fetal monitor’s digital heart rate display at most\n\nevery 30 minutes, instead of every 15 minutes as Dr. Gorrín\n\ntestified was standard.        Indeed, the jury may have concluded that\n\nNurse Marrero did not even check the fetal heart rate monitor every\n\n30 minutes.        Dr. Gorrín testified that the fetal heart rates\n\nrecorded by Marrero “are totally out of context not only to the\n\npart   of   the    fetal   heart   rate    tracing   which    we   did    get   an\n\nopportunity to evaluate, but of the catastrophic condition of the\n\nbaby when she was born,\" implying that Marrero may have falsified\n\nthe record.       Moreover, Marcano testified that she was alone in the\n\nhospital room between 11:45 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. –- a period of\n\nnearly three hours –- and that nurses failed to respond when she\n\nrepeatedly attempted to summon them during that time.                    Based on\n\nthis testimony, the jury could reasonably have concluded that\n\nMarrero failed to adequately monitor the labor.\n\n            2. Causation\n\n            To     establish   causation    under    Puerto   Rico   law,    \"[a]\n\nplaintiff must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the\n\nphysician’s negligent conduct was the factor that ‘most probably’\n\ncaused harm to the plaintiff.\"             Lama, 16 F.3d at 478 (quoting\n\nSierra Perez v. United States, 779 F. Supp. 637, 643 (D.P.R.\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\f1991)).   While this causation standard does not require all other\n\ncauses of damage to be eliminated, \"a jury normally cannot find\n\ncausation      based    on     mere    speculation   and   conjecture;   expert\n\ntestimony is generally essential.\" Id.; see also Rojas-Ithier, 394\n\nF.3d at 43 (\"[A] factfinder normally cannot find causation without\n\nthe assistance of expert testimony to clarify complex medical and\n\nscientific issues that are more prevalent in medical malpractice\n\ncases than in standard negligence cases.\").\n\n            HIMA argues that there was insufficient evidence for a\n\nreasonable jury to find that its negligent monitoring was \"most\n\nprobably\" the factor that caused Fabiola to be injured during her\n\ndelivery.      It contends that the evidence demonstrated instead that\n\nFabiola's injuries were mostly likely the result of Dr. Roldán's\n\nnegligence.\n\n            The issue of causation is complicated in this case by the\n\ndisappearance of the fetal monitor tracing for the period between\n\n10 a.m.     and 3:27 p.m.             Experts for both parties agree that\n\nFabiola's heart rate was in the normal range for a short time after\n\n3:27, when the tracing begins, and that it dropped perilously low\n\nat approximately 5 p.m., shortly before the tracing ends.                      The\n\nexperts also agree that the low heart rate reading at 5 p.m.\n\nindicates that Fabiola was in distress and that Dr. Roldán, who was\n\npresent   at    the    time,    should    have   taken   steps   immediately   to\n\nameliorate the situation.             Such steps would have included turning\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\foff the Oxytocin drip to reduce the strength and frequency of\n\ncontractions, turning Marcano on her side to increase the flow of\n\noxygen to the fetus, administering oxygen to Marcano, and, if those\n\nmeasures failed, performing a cesarean section.   It is undisputed\n\nthat Dr. Roldán took none of these steps; by the time Fabiola was\n\nborn at 6:19 p.m., she was suffering from neonatal asphyxia.\n\n          HIMA's medical experts testified that because the fetal\n\nmonitor indicated a normal heart rate at 3:27 p.m. and an ominously\n\nlow heart rate at 5 p.m., Fabiola’s injuries must have occurred\n\nsometime between 3:27 p.m. and 6:19 p.m.     Emphasizing that Dr.\n\nRoldán was present throughout that period and failed to act, HIMA\n\nargues that Fabiola's injuries are directly attributable to the\n\ndoctor's failure to intervene and that any failure of monitoring\n\nbefore 3:27 p.m. did not cause the asphyxia. HIMA further contends\n\nthat without the tracing for the period before 3:27 p.m., any\n\nconclusion that the injury occurred during that period would be\n\nbased on impermissible speculation.\n\n          HIMA is correct that, without the missing tracing, it is\n\nimpossible to know with certainty whether the fetus was in distress\n\nbefore 3:27 p.m. –- or, more particularly, between 11:45 a.m., when\n\nDr. Roldán induced the labor and left a nurse in charge of the\n\nmonitoring, and 2:45 p.m., when Dr. Roldán returned to Marcano's\n\nbedside to supervise the delivery.    It does not follow, however,\n\nthat no reasonable jury could find that negligent monitoring during\n\n\n                               -12-\n\fthat period most probably caused or contributed to Fabiola’s\n\ninjuries.       Although HIMA's experts testified that the normal fetal\n\nheart rate at 3:27 p.m. indicated a smooth process up to that\n\npoint,    the    plaintiffs'   expert,   Dr.   Gorrín,   took   a   different\n\nposition.   He testified that a normal fetal heart rate at 3:27 p.m.\n\ndoes not rule out the possibility that the fetus was in distress\n\nearlier:\n\n     The baby could have had an hypoxic episode producing\n     asphyxia, and mother nature will try to preserve life,\n     and the baby's heart will not necessarily stay at [the\n     below-normal rate of] 60 beats per minute or the baby\n     might not even die if he was severely asphyxiated during\n     a window of time when he or she was subjected not to one,\n     but to two medications, one of which at a very excessive\n     dose and another one at a dose we'll never know about,\n     without monitoring. I cannot say just because there was\n     an 18-minute window [between 3:27 p.m. and 3:45 p.m.]\n     with an adequate baseline fetal heart rate that nothing\n     else happened before [the beginning of the tracing at\n     3:27 p.m.].\n\n            Dr. Gorrín’s testimony that the fetus may have been\n\ndeprived of oxygen between 11:45 a.m. and 3:27 p.m. is consistent\n\nwith the evidence presented about the effects of Oxytocin and\n\nCytotec, the drugs Dr. Roldán used to induce labor.             Experts for\n\nboth parties testified that it is contraindicated to administer\n\nOxytocin and Cytotec simultaneously because, in the words of Dr.\n\nGorrín,\n\n     the synergistic effect of one drug, which acts to produce\n     uterine contractions on top of another, which also acts\n     to produce uterine contractions, will cause something\n     like adding two plus two and getting five instead of\n     four. . . One thing works with the other, and the lump\n     effect is a lot more than just the sum of each one.\n\n                                    -13-\n\fThe experts also testified that contractions that are too intense\n\nor too frequent can deprive the fetus of oxygen and lead to a\n\ndepressed heart rate.         Shockingly, Dr. Roldán administered both\n\nOxytocin and Cytotec simultaneously, and he administered four times\n\nthe appropriate dose of Cytotec.\n\n           According     to     Marcano's       testimony,    the     intense\n\ncontractions began almost immediately after Dr. Roldán administered\n\nthe drugs at 11:45 a.m., and continued until at least 2:45 p.m.,\n\nwhen her husband summoned Dr. Roldán to return to the room.               That\n\ntiming is consistent with Dr. Gorrín's testimony that Oxytocin\n\nwould exert its effect within ten minutes of being administered and\n\nthat Cytotec, if placed in the vagina as it was here, would also\n\nexert its effect in a short while.           That timing is also consistent\n\nwith ACOG’s recommendation that doctors wait four hours between\n\nadministering Oxytocin and Cytotec; the waiting period suggests\n\nthat   either   drug   exerts   its    strongest    effects   in    the   hours\n\nimmediately after it is administered.              A reasonable jury could\n\ntherefore have concluded that Marcano suffered the most intense and\n\nfrequent contractions beginning shortly after 11:45 a.m., that the\n\nmissing tracing would reveal that Fabiola was deprived of oxygen\n\nduring this period, and that negligent monitoring between 11:45\n\na.m. and Dr. Roldán's return at 2:45 p.m. caused or contributed to\n\nFabiola's injuries.      Although HIMA's experts testified that the\n\ndamage occurred later, such contradictory expert testimony \"does\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fnothing to vitiate the sufficiency of the plaintiff’s proof.\"\n\nMuñiz v. Rovira, 373 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n              The plaintiffs introduced sufficient evidence to support\n\na finding that negligent monitoring on the part of HIMA caused\n\nFabiola's injuries.           The district court therefore did not err in\n\ndenying HIMA’s Rule 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law.\n\nB.            Admission of Expert Testimony\n\n              The plaintiffs offered testimony at trial by life-care\n\nplanner Frank Woodrich regarding the projected cost of Fabiola's\n\nfuture care.        HIMA objected to Woodrich's testimony, both through\n\na    motion    in    limine    and   at    trial,   arguing   that   Woodrich's\n\nmethodology, the foundation for his testimony, was not reliable.\n\nThe court denied the motion in limine without explanation.                  In\n\nresponse to the renewed objection at the outset of Woodrich's\n\ntestimony, the court allowed HIMA to conduct a brief voir dire of\n\nWoodrich.      After a series of questions focusing on Woodrich's\n\nfailure to have a physician review his projections regarding\n\nFabiola's future medical needs, HIMA moved again to strike Woodrich\n\nas an expert.       The district court overruled the motion, commenting\n\nthat \"what you're doing is going to the weight, not to the\n\nexpertise.\"         HIMA argues that the district court’s ruling was\n\nerroneous.\n\n              The admission of expert testimony is governed by Federal\n\nRule of Evidence 702, which requires that \"(1) the testimony is\n\n\n                                          -15-\n\fbased upon sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the\n\nproduct of reliable principles and methods, and (3) the witness has\n\napplied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the\n\ncase.\"   Rule 702 \"imposes a gate-keeping function on the trial\n\njudge to ensure that an expert's testimony 'both rests on a\n\nreliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.'\"    United\n\nStates v. Mooney, 315 F.3d 54, 62 (1st Cir. 2002) (quoting Daubert\n\nv. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 597 (1993)). We review\n\nthe district court's decision to admit expert testimony for abuse\n\nof discretion.    Id.\n\n          The district court considered Woodrich's professional\n\ncredentials and ascertained that he had been admitted as an expert\n\non rehabilitation and life-care planning in numerous state and\n\nfederal courts before accepting him as an expert in this case.\n\nWoodrich also testified that his proposed care plan for Fabiola was\n\nbased on a review of records from the agency providing her with\n\nskilled nursing care, a letter from her physician, and an interview\n\nof Fabiola's family and caregiver.      Although Woodrich's report\n\nmight have benefitted from a physician's review of the projections\n\nregarding Fabiola's future needs, the court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion   in   determining   that   Woodrich's   methodology   was\n\nsufficiently reliable for admissibility.\n\n\n\n\n                                -16-\n\fC.           Motion for a New Trial or Remittitur\n\n             Finally, HIMA claims that the district court erred in\n\ndenying its motion for new trial or remittitur under Federal Rule\n\nof Civil Procedure 59.        \"A district court should only grant such\n\nmotions if the outcome is against the clear weight of the evidence\n\nsuch that upholding the verdict will result in a miscarriage of\n\njustice.\"    Johnson v. Spencer Press of Me., Inc., 364 F.3d 368, 375\n\n(1st Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted).              Our review is\n\nfor an abuse of discretion.           Id.\n\n             1. Apportionment of Liability\n\n             HIMA contends that even if its negligent monitoring\n\nplayed   a   role   in    Fabiola’s    injuries,   its   negligence    was   far\n\noutweighed by Dr. Roldán’s negligence in inducing and handling the\n\nlabor. As such, HIMA maintains, there was insufficient evidence to\n\nsupport a jury finding that it was liable for 47% of the damage and\n\nit is entitled to a new trial on apportionment of liability.                 The\n\ndistrict court rejected this argument, ruling that \"the plaintiff's\n\nexpert   witness    and    several    documents    admitted   into    evidence\"\n\nsupported a finding that HIMA's negligence caused 47% of the\n\nplaintiffs' damages.        We agree.\n\n             In a repeat of their argument that there was insufficient\n\nevidence that the hospital caused or contributed to Fabiola's\n\ninjuries,    HIMA   argues    that     without   the   missing   tracing,    any\n\nevidence that Fabiola was deprived of oxygen while the nurse was\n\n\n                                       -17-\n\fresponsible for monitoring in Dr. Roldán's absence (i.e., between\n\n11:45 a.m. and 2:45 p.m.) is impermissible speculation.             That\n\nreasoning would have the effect of punishing the plaintiffs for\n\nHIMA's failure to produce the tracing, and we reject it again.\n\nAlthough there is no way to know for certain what happened between\n\n11:45 a.m. and 2:45 p.m. without the tracing, the circumstantial\n\nevidence, together with Dr. Gorrín's expert testimony, would allow\n\na reasonable jury to find that Marcano's strong contractions\n\nbetween 11:45 a.m. and 2:45 p.m. deprived Fabiola of oxygen and\n\nthat HIMA's negligent monitoring during that period deprived Dr.\n\nRoldán of an opportunity to intervene before Fabiola suffered\n\npermanent damage. While Dr. Roldán was unquestionably negligent as\n\nwell, the 47-53 apportionment of liability was not contrary to the\n\nclear weight of the evidence.\n\n           2. Excessiveness\n\n           Under the Supreme Court's holding in Gasperini v. Center\n\nfor Humanities, Inc., 518 U.S. 415 (1996), federal courts sitting\n\nin   diversity   must   apply   state   substantive   law   standards   in\n\nreviewing jury awards if the state law departs from the federal\n\nstandards for judging excessiveness.       See id. at 431 (\"Erie [R.R.\n\nCo. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64 (1938),] precludes a recovery in\n\nfederal court significantly larger than the recovery that would\n\nhave been tolerated in state court.\"). Emphasizing that the Puerto\n\nRico Supreme Court has reduced damages awards to victims of medical\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\fmalpractice to conform to its own precedent, HIMA maintains that\n\nthe district court was obligated under Gasperini to reduce the\n\nplaintiffs' award to conform with Puerto Rico precedent.                         The\n\ndistrict court rejected this argument in a post-verdict ruling.\n\n            We have previously rejected the argument that Gasperini\n\nrequires federal district courts to review damages awards for\n\nconsistency with awards approved by the Supreme Court of Puerto\n\nRico in similar cases.            As we have explained, Gasperini would\n\ncontrol    if    state    law   departed     from    the   ordinary   practice    of\n\nreviewing       awards    under    the      federal    standards      for    judging\n\nexcessiveness, but Puerto Rico law \"suggests no such departure.\"\n\nGrajales-Romero,         194    F.3d   at   300     (internal    quotation    marks\n\nomitted); see also Mejias Quiros v. Maxxam Prop. Corp., 108 F.3d\n\n425, 427 n.1 (1st Cir. 1997) (same); cf. Stewart v. Tupperware\n\nCorp., 356 F.3d 335, 339 (1st Cir. 2004) (applying Grajales-Romero\n\nto   the    amount-in-controversy           determination       for   purposes    of\n\ndiversity jurisdiction).\n\n            Emphasizing that none of the cases in which we have\n\nrejected Gasperini arguments involved medical malpractice claims,\n\nHIMA asserts that Gasperini requires a remittitur of damages here\n\ndespite our extant case law.             HIMA's argument is based primarily\n\non Nieves Cruz v. Universidad de Puerto Rico, 151 P.R. Dec. 150\n\n(2000), a case in which the Puerto Rico Supreme Court remitted a\n\n$3.9 million award to a minor plaintiff who, like Fabiola, suffered\n\n\n                                         -19-\n\ffrom severe hypoxia during childbirth.                In reducing the original\n\njudgment by approximately 50%, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court\n\nexplained     that   it   was    \"[f]ollowing       the    parameters    of   .   .   .\n\nprecedent.\"      Id. (certified translation).              The precedent on which\n\nthe Nieves court relied was Riley v. Rodríguez de Pacheco, 119 P.R.\n\nDec. 762 (1987), in which the court reduced a damages award in a\n\nmedical malpractice case because \"[w]ithout certain reasonable\n\nlimits, the compensation would cease to have the characteristic of\n\ncompensation [and would] become punitive\" (quoted in Nieves, 151\n\nP.R. Dec. 150 (certified translation)).              HIMA contends that Nieves\n\nreflects a Puerto Rico standard for reviewing damages awards in\n\nmedical malpractice cases that differs from the federal standard of\n\nreviewing to determine whether an award is \"grossly excessive,\" and\n\nthat Gasperini requires us to adopt the Puerto Rico standard in\n\nthis case.\n\n              We view this issue as a close one.             As HIMA emphasizes,\n\nthe Puerto Rico Supreme Court has remitted a damages award in at\n\nleast two medical malpractice cases to conform with the Riley\n\nprecedent.     See Nieves, 151 P.R. Dec. 150; Blás Toledo v. Hospital\n\nNuestra Señora de la Guadalupe, 146 P.R. Dec. 267 (1998).                     On the\n\nother hand, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has indicated that it\n\n\"will not intervene in the decision on the estimation of damages\n\nissued   by    the   lower      courts,    unless    the    amounts     granted   are\n\nridiculously low or exaggeratedly high.\" Nieves, 151 P.R. Dec. 150\n\n\n                                          -20-\n\f(certified   translation).     Puerto      Rico's   \"exaggeratedly      high\"\n\nstandard echoes the federal \"grossly excessive\" standard.                That\n\nconsonance distinguishes this case from Gasperini, which involved\n\na New York law that empowered state courts to reduce any damages\n\naward that \"deviates materially from what would be reasonable\n\ncompensation.\" 518 U.S. at 418. The Supreme Court emphasized that\n\nNew York's \"deviates materially\" rule entailed \"[m]ore rigorous\n\ncomparative evaluations\" than the federal standard and that it had\n\na \"manifestly substantive\" objective.            Id. at 429.       Unlike New\n\nYork's \"deviates materially\" standard, the Puerto Rico Supreme\n\nCourt's standard has been expressed in terms similar to the federal\n\nstandard.\n\n            In the end, therefore, we are unable to conclude that the\n\nremittiturs in Blás-Toledo and Nieves mean that the Puerto Rico\n\nSupreme Court has adopted a more rigorous standard of review for\n\nmedical malpractice damages that is tantamount to a substantive\n\nrule of law that must be applied in diversity cases.            That is, we\n\ncannot say, on the basis of the available precedents, that Puerto\n\nRico case law suggests a \"departure from [the] ordinary practice of\n\nreviewing    awards   under   the    federal     standards     for     judging\n\nexcessiveness.\"       Grajales-Romero,     194   F.3d   at   300     (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted) (alteration in original).           In the absence\n\nof such a departure, Gasperini controls.          See id.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\f            Therefore,      the     district   court       did   not   abuse     its\n\ndiscretion in rejecting HIMA's claim that the damages awarded to\n\nthe plaintiffs were excessive. \"[A] party seeking remittitur bears\n\na heavy burden of showing that an award is grossly excessive,\n\ninordinate, shocking to the conscience of the court, or so high\n\nthat it would be a denial of justice to permit it to stand.\"\n\nCurrier v. United Techs. Corp., 393 F.3d 246, 256 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(internal       quotation   marks    omitted).        As   the   district      court\n\nrecognized, the plaintiffs presented ample evidence of the severe\n\nphysical and emotional toll that Fabiola's permanent injuries have\n\ninflicted, and will continue to inflict, on both her and her\n\nfamily. Woodrich testified that Fabiola's life-care plan alone had\n\na   cost   of    approximately      $1.9   million.        The   plaintiffs     also\n\npresented evidence that Fabiola's loss of potential income was\n\napproximately $350,000, and that Fabiola and her parents suffered\n\nsevere pain and anguish as a result of her injuries.                   In light of\n\nthis evidence, the jury awarded $4 million to Fabiola, $1 million\n\nto her mother, and $500,000 to her father.4                       Moreover, HIMA\n\n\n      4\n      In summarizing the evidence supporting the $5.5 million\ndamages award, the court emphasized that\n\n      [b]aby Fabiola, who was only three years old at the time\n      of trial, has a long life expectancy.       In fact, Dr.\n      Woodrich, an expert in rehabilitation counseling and life\n      care planning, prepared a life care plan for Fabiola\n      which was submitted to the jury . . . . There was also\n      testimony from Carlos Rodríguez, an economist, relative\n      to Fabiola's loss of potential income. The jury also\n      heard testimony regarding baby Fabiola's grim prognosis;\n\n                                       -22-\n\fconceded at trial that it had \"presented no evidence to offset\n\nFabiola's and her family's damages. We agree that she has suffered\n\nserious damages, both the baby and the family.     Our sole issues\n\nwith the damages is not to negate [their] existence, but to make\n\nclear that it was Dr. Pedro Roldán, and not HIMA, [who was] the\n\nresponsible party.\" In light of this concession, together with the\n\nevidence offered at trial, an award of $5.5 million (of which HIMA\n\nwill pay $2.585 million) does not shock the conscience. See Muñiz,\n\n373 F.3d at 6 (upholding a medical malpractice award of $2 million\n\nto a minor who suffered nerve damage to his arm and shoulder at\n\nbirth).\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     the fact that she has no chance for a normal development,\n     the fact that she will require a care giver for the rest\n     of her life; and the physical pain and anguish that she\n     endures as a result of her daily physical therapy\n     sessions.    The jury also heard testimony of Haydée\n     Costas, an expert in psychiatry, who diagnosed Maria\n     Yolanda Marcano as suffering from a major depression.\n     The record in this case is replete with evidence of the\n     pain endured and yet to be endured by both Fabiola and\n     her parents, as a result of the injuries that she\n     sustained at childbirth.\n\n                               -23-\n\f",

HIMA argues that there was insufficient evidence to establish its liability and that the evidence showed instead that Dr. Pedro Rold&#225;n Millan (\"Dr.Rold&#225;n\"), the non-employee obstetrician who delivered Fabiola, was solely responsible for Fabiola's injuries. HIMA further claims that the district court erred in allowing testimony by one of the plaintiffs' experts and in not remitting the damages award or awarding a new trial on apportionment of liability.

Am. Airlines,</i> 194 F.3d 288, 292 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the morning of September 14, 2000, plaintiff Maria Marcano Rivera (\"Marcano\") was admitted to HIMA, a hospital in Caguas, Puerto Rico, pursuant to her obstetrician's decision to induce labor. The obstetrician, Dr. Rold&#225;n, was not an employee of HIMA but had privileges there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At 10 a.m., HIMA nurses attached Marcano to a fetal monitor, which monitors both the fetus's heart rate and the mother's uterine contractions. A fetal monitor provides a digital display of the fetal heart rate and prints out a paper record, known as a tracing, of the heart rate and the contractions. HIMA protocol dictates that nurses check the fetal monitor and record the fetal heart rate every 15 minutes during high-risk deliveries, including induced labor. HIMA protocol also provides that the nurse monitoring the delivery is responsible for notifying the physician of any abnormal fetal heart rate or uterine contraction findings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At 11:45 a.m., Dr. Rold&#225;n induced labor by simultaneously administering Oxytocin through an intravenous drip and inserting in Marcano's vagina a 100 mcg tablet of Cytotec from his personal supply. Dr. Rold&#225;n's simultaneous administration of the two drugs was contrary to HIMA protocol and medical standards established by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (\"ACOG\"). Both Oxytocin and Cytotec stimulate uterine contractions; together they have a multiplier effect and can produce contractions that are too intense or too close together, thereby decreasing the flow of oxygen to the fetus. ACOG thus recommends a four-hour waiting period between administering Oxytocin and Cytotec. Moreover, the recommended dose of Cytotec &#8212; when taken alone &#8212; is only 25 mcg. The higher 100 meg dose administered by Dr. Rold&#225;n also risks producing contractions which are too intense or too close together.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after Dr. Rold&#225;n administered the drugs, he left Marcano's room. Marcano soon began to feel intense contractions. Although she rang the nurse call button repeatedly, the nurse monitoring the delivery, Brenda Marrero, did not respond.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Marcano's husband, Jorge Rodr&#237;guez Matos (\"Rodr&#237;guez\"), joined her at approximately 2:30 p.m., he found her in a desperate state because of frequent contractions. She told him that the contractions were not like the ones she experienced with the delivery of her first child and that she could not stand the pain. Rodr&#237;guez went to the nurses' station and asked them to summon Dr. Rold&#225;n. At approximately 2:45, Dr. Rold&#225;n returned to Marcano's room and administered Demerol, a pain killer. He remained in the room throughout the rest of the delivery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Oddly, the tracing from the fetal heart rate monitor is missing for the period between 10 a.m. and 3:27 p.m., meaning there is no way to evaluate the fetus's heart rate and oxygen supply while Marcano was alone in her hospital room.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The tracing between 3:27 p.m. and 3:45 p.m. appears normal, but that reading does not preclude the possibility that the fetus was deprived of oxygen during the period for which the tracing is missing. Between 3:45 p.m. and 5 p.m., the tracing reveals a continuing pattern of contractions that were too intense and too close together, accompanied by a low fetal heart rate. These factors suggest that the fetus was not receiving sufficient oxygen. The tracing ends at approximately 5 p.m., when Marcano was transferred to the delivery room and the monitor was disconnected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baby Fabiola was born at 6:19 p.m. She was taken immediately to the neonatal intensive care unit, where she was diagnosed with neonatal asphyxia and seizures secondary to neonatal asphyxia, and where she spent approximately two weeks before being discharged to her parents. Marcano and Rodr&#237;guez did not learn until four months later that Fabiola had permanent neurological damage as a result of neonatal asphyxia. Fabiola continues to suffer from daily seizures, and her prognosis is grim. Although she has an anticipated life span of 45 years, she will never see, walk, or communicate, and will require a care-giver for the rest of her life.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Procedural history</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 16, 2002, the plaintiffs sued Dr. Rold&#225;n and HIMA<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> in federal district court for medical malpractice resulting in severe neurological damage to Fabiola. Early in the litigation, the plaintiffs reached a settlement with Dr. Rold&#225;n, who is no longer in practice. Their malpractice claims against HIMA proceeded to trial in October 2003, principally on the theory that HIMA employees failed to adequately monitor the labor and childbirth process and that HIMA's failure contributed to Fabiola's injuries.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Specifically, the plaintiffs suggested that the neurological damage occurred during the period for which the tracing is missing, and that regular monitoring would have alerted Dr. Rold&#225;an to Fabiola's distress in enough time to avert permanent damage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following a five-day trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs. The jury found that both HIMA and Dr. Rold&#225;n had been negligent and that their negligence was the proximate cause of the plaintiffs' damages. It awarded $5.5 million in damages, apportioning 47% of the liability to HIMA and 53% of the liability to Dr. Rold&#225;n. Accordingly, the court entered judgment against HIMA for $2.585 million (<i>i.e.,</i> 47% of $5.5 million). The court subsequently denied HIMA's post-verdict motion for judgment as a matter of law, a new trial on apportionment of liability, or remittitur.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">HIMA raises several arguments on appeal. First, it asserts that the district court erred in denying its motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50. Second, it assigns error to the district court's decision to admit testimony by one of the plaintiffs' expert witnesses. Finally, HIMA contends that the district court abused its discretion in failing to grant its motion for a new trial or remittitur under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59. We consider these claims in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While conceding that Fabiola suffered permanent neurological damage during birth, HIMA argues that the evidence at trial was insufficient to allow a reasonable jury to conclude that the damage was causally linked to negligent monitoring. The district court rejected this argument in denying a post-verdict motion for judgment as a matter of law, concluding that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">there was ample evidence presented to the jury, which if believed, could sustain a finding that HIMA was indeed negligent in monitoring plaintiff's labor and that said negligence proximately caused the alleged injuries.... [T]he jury heard evidence that the monitoring was done every thirty minutes as opposed to every 15 minutes, as was standard in induced labors. Most importantly, the jury was allowed to make reasonable inferences from the fact that a significant portion of the tracing of the fetal heart rate and uterine contractions monitoring machine was missing, and HIMA was unable to give any explanation therefor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A party seeking to overturn a jury verdict faces an uphill battle. \"Courts may only grant a judgment contravening a jury's determination when the evidence points so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of the moving party that no reasonable jury could have returned a verdict adverse to that party.\" <i>Rivera Castillo v.

We review <i>de novo</i> the district court's denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <i>Tapalian v.

To prevail on a medical malpractice claim under Puerto Rico law, \"a party must establish (1) the duty owed; (2) an act or omission transgressing that duty; and (3) a sufficient causal nexus between the breach and the harm.\" <i>Id.</i> HIMA cites deficiencies in the plaintiffs' evidence as to both the first and third prongs of this test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Duty</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Puerto Rico courts have explained the standard of care owed to patients as \"[t]hat [level of care] which, recognizing the modern means of communication and education, ... meets the professional requirements generally acknowledged by the medical profession.\" <i>Lama v. Borras,</i> 16 F.3d 473, 478 (1st Cir.1994) (quoting <i>Oliveros v. Abreu,</i> 101 P.R. Dec. 209, 226 (1973)). The standard is a national one, and ordinarily must be demonstrated through expert testimony. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Jose Juan Gorr&#237;n Peralta (\"Dr.Gorr&#237;n\"), explained that the standard of care requires monitoring high-risk deliveries, including induced labor, every 15 minutes. Monitoring includes evaluating both the fetal heart rate and uterine contraction information provided by the fetal monitor's paper tracings and the fetal heart rate information provided by the fetal monitor's digital display. Monitoring is a shared responsibility of the doctor and the nurse; when the doctor is not present, the nurse is in charge of the monitoring. Dr. Gorr&#237;n's testimony on this point was corroborated by HIMA's expert, Dr. Jos&#233; Vargas Cordero, who testified that when the doctor is not present, the nurse is in charge of checking both the tracing and the digital monitor, and that if the nurse notices an abnormal reading, she must call the doctor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that HIMA failed to monitor Marcano's labor in accordance with the national standard of care. It is undisputed that Nurse Marrero checked the fetal monitor's digital heart rate display at most every 30 minutes, instead of every 15 minutes as Dr. Gorr&#237;n testified was standard. Indeed, the jury may have concluded that Nurse Marrero did not even check the fetal heart rate monitor every 30 minutes. Dr. Gorr&#237;n testified that the fetal heart rates recorded by Marrero \"are totally out of context not only to the part of the fetal heart rate tracing which we did get an opportunity to evaluate, but of the catastrophic condition of the baby when she was born,\" implying that Marrero may have falsified the record. Moreover, Marcano testified that she was alone in the hospital room between 11:45 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. &#8212; a period of nearly three hours &#8212; and that nurses failed to respond when she repeatedly attempted to summon them during that time. Based on this testimony, the jury could reasonably have concluded that Marrero failed to adequately monitor the labor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Causation</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To establish causation under Puerto Rico law, \"[a] plaintiff must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the physician's negligent conduct was the factor that `most probably' caused harm to the plaintiff.\" <i>Lama,</i> 16 F.3d at 478 (quoting <i>Sierra Perez v. United States,</i> 779 F.Supp. 637, 643 (D.P.R.1991)). While this causation standard does not require all other causes of damage to be eliminated, \"a jury normally cannot find causation based on mere speculation and conjecture; expert testimony is generally essential.\" <i>Id.; see also Rojas-Ithier,</i> 394 F.3d at 43 (\"[A] factfinder normally cannot find causation without the assistance of expert testimony to clarify complex medical and scientific issues that are more prevalent in medical malpractice cases than in standard negligence cases.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">HIMA argues that there was insufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that its negligent monitoring was \"most probably\" the factor that caused Fabiola to be injured during her delivery. It contends that the evidence demonstrated instead that Fabiola's injuries were mostly likely the result of Dr. Rold&#225;n's negligence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue of causation is complicated in this case by the disappearance of the fetal monitor tracing for the period between 10 a.m. and 3:27 p.m. Experts for both parties agree that Fabiola's heart rate was in the normal range for a short time after 3:27, when the tracing begins, and that it dropped perilously low at approximately 5 p.m., shortly before the tracing ends. The experts also agree that the low heart rate reading at 5 p.m. indicates that Fabiola was in distress and that Dr. Rold&#225;n, who was present at the time, should have taken steps immediately to ameliorate the situation. Such steps would have included turning off the Oxytocin drip to reduce the strength and frequency of contractions, turning Marcano on her side to increase the flow of oxygen to the fetus, administering oxygen to Marcano, and, if those measures failed, performing a cesarean section. It is undisputed that Dr. Rold&#225;n took none of these steps; by the time Fabiola was born at 6:19 p.m., she was suffering from neonatal asphyxia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">HIMA's medical experts testified that because the fetal monitor indicated a normal heart rate at 3:27 p.m. and an ominously low heart rate at 5 p.m., Fabiola's injuries must have occurred sometime between 3:27 p.m. and 6:19 p.m. Emphasizing that Dr. Rold&#225;n was present throughout that period and failed to act, HIMA argues that Fabiola's injuries are directly attributable to the doctor's failure to intervene and that any failure of monitoring before 3:27 p.m. did not cause the asphyxia. HIMA further contends that without the tracing for the period before 3:27 p.m., any conclusion that the injury occurred during that period would be based on impermissible speculation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">HIMA is correct that, without the missing tracing, it is impossible to know with certainty whether the fetus was in distress before 3:27 p.m. &#8212; or, more particularly, between 11:45 a.m., when Dr. Rold&#225;n induced the labor and left a nurse in charge of the monitoring, and 2:45 p.m., when Dr. Rold&#225;n returned to Marcano's bedside to supervise the delivery. It does not follow, however, that no reasonable jury could find that negligent monitoring during that period most probably caused or contributed to Fabiola's injuries. Although HIMA's experts testified that the normal fetal heart rate at 3:27 p.m. indicated a smooth process up to that point, the plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Gorr&#237;n, took a different position. He testified that a normal fetal heart rate at 3:27 p.m. does not rule out the possibility that the fetus was in distress earlier:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The baby could have had an hypoxic episode producing asphyxia, and mother nature will try to preserve life, and the baby's heart will not necessarily stay at [the below-normal rate of] 60 beats per minute or the baby might not even die if he was severely asphyxiated during a window of time when he or she was subjected not to one, but to two medications, one of which at a very excessive dose and another one at a dose we'll never know about, without monitoring. I cannot say just because there was an 18-minute window [between 3:27 p.m. and 3:45 p.m.] with an adequate baseline fetal heart rate that nothing else happened before [the beginning of the tracing at 3:27 p.m.].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Gorr&#237;n's testimony that the fetus may have been deprived of oxygen between 11:45 a.m. and 3:27 p.m. is consistent with the evidence presented about the effects of Oxytocin and Cytotec, the drugs Dr. Rold&#225;n used to induce labor. Experts for both parties testified that it is contraindicated to administer Oxytocin and Cytotec simultaneously because, in the words of Dr. Gorr&#237;n,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the synergistic effect of one drug, which acts to produce uterine contractions on top of another, which also acts to produce uterine contractions, will cause something like adding two plus two and getting five instead of four ... One thing works with the other, and the lump effect is a lot more than just the sum of each one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The experts also testified that contractions that are too intense or too frequent can deprive the fetus of oxygen and lead to a depressed heart rate. Shockingly, Dr. Rold&#225;n administered both Oxytocin and Cytotec simultaneously, and he administered four times the appropriate dose of Cytotec.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Marcano's testimony, the intense contractions began almost immediately after Dr. Rold&#225;n administered the drugs at 11:45 a.m., and continued until at least 2:45 p.m., when her husband summoned Dr. Rold&#225;n to return to the room. That timing is consistent with Dr. Gorr&#237;n's testimony that Oxytocin would exert its effect within ten minutes of being administered and that Cytotec, if placed in the vagina as it was here, would also exert its effect in a short while. That timing is also consistent with ACOG's recommendation that doctors wait four hours between administering Oxytocin and Cytotec; the waiting period suggests that either drug exerts its strongest effects in the hours immediately after it is administered. A reasonable jury could therefore have concluded that Marcano suffered the most intense and frequent contractions beginning shortly after 11:45 a.m., that the missing tracing would reveal that Fabiola was deprived of oxygen during this period, and that negligent monitoring between 11:45 a.m. and Dr. Rold&#225;n's return at 2:45 p.m. caused or contributed to Fabiola's injuries. Although HIMA's experts testified that the damage occurred later, such contradictory expert testimony \"does nothing to vitiate the sufficiency of the plaintiff's proof.\" <i>Muniz v. Rovira,</i> 373 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs introduced sufficient evidence to support a finding that negligent monitoring on the part of HIMA caused Fabiola's injuries. The district court therefore did not err in denying HIMA's Rule 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Admission of Expert Testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs offered testimony at trial by life-care planner Frank Woodrich regarding the projected cost of Fabiola's future care. HIMA objected to Woodrich's testimony, both through a motion in limine and at trial, arguing that Woodrich's methodology, the foundation for his testimony, was not reliable. The court denied the motion in limine without explanation. In response to the renewed objection at the outset of Woodrich's testimony, the court allowed HIMA to conduct a brief voir dire of Woodrich. After a series of questions focusing on Woodrich's failure to have a physician review his projections regarding Fabiola's future medical needs, HIMA moved again to strike Woodrich as an expert. The district court overruled the motion, commenting that \"what you're doing is going to the weight, not to the expertise.\" HIMA argues that the district court's ruling was erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The admission of expert testimony is governed by Federal Rule of Evidence 702, which requires that \"(1) the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.\" Rule 702 \"imposes a gate-keeping function on the trial judge to ensure that an expert's testimony `both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.'\" <i>United States v. Mooney,</i> 315 F.3d 54, 62 (1st Cir.2002) (quoting <i>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc.,</i> 509 U.S. 579, 597, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993)). We review the district court's decision to admit expert testimony for abuse of discretion. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court considered Woodrich's professional credentials and ascertained that he had been admitted as an expert on rehabilitation and life-care planning in numerous state and federal courts before accepting him as an expert in this case. Woodrich also testified that his proposed care plan for Fabiola was based on a review of records from the agency providing her with skilled nursing care, a letter from her physician, and an interview of Fabiola's family and caregiver. Although Woodrich's report might have benefitted from a physician's review of the projections regarding Fabiola's future needs, the court did not abuse its discretion in determining that Woodrich's methodology was sufficiently reliable for admissibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Motion for a New Trial or Remittitur</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, HIMA claims that the district court erred in denying its motion for new trial or remittitur under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59. \"A district court should only grant such motions if the outcome is against the clear weight of the evidence such that upholding the verdict will result in a miscarriage of justice.\" <i>Johnson v. Spencer Press of Me., Inc.,</i> 364 F.3d 368, 375 (1st Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). Our review is for an abuse of discretion. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Apportionment of Liability</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">HIMA contends that even if its negligent monitoring played a role in Fabiola's injuries, its negligence was far outweighed by Dr. Rold&#225;n's negligence in inducing and handling the labor. As such, HIMA maintains, there was insufficient evidence to support a jury finding that it was liable for 47% of the damage and it is entitled to a new trial on apportionment of liability. The district court rejected this argument, ruling that \"the plaintiff's expert witness and several documents admitted into evidence\" supported a finding that HIMA's negligence caused 47% of the plaintiffs' damages. We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a repeat of their argument that there was insufficient evidence that the hospital caused or contributed to Fabiola's injuries, HIMA argues that without the missing tracing, any evidence that Fabiola was deprived of oxygen while the nurse was responsible for monitoring in Dr. Rold&#225;n's absence (<i>i.e.,</i> between 11:45 a.m. and 2:45 p.m.) is impermissible speculation. That reasoning would have the effect of punishing the plaintiffs for HIMA's failure to produce the tracing, and we reject it again. Although there is no way to know for certain what happened between 11:45 a.m. and 2:45 p.m. without the tracing, the circumstantial evidence, together with Dr. Gorr&#237;n's expert testimony, would allow a reasonable jury to find that Marcano's strong contractions between 11:45 a.m. and 2:45 p.m. deprived Fabiola of oxygen and that HIMA's negligent monitoring during that period deprived Dr. Rold&#225;n of an opportunity to intervene before Fabiola suffered permanent damage. While Dr. Rold&#225;n was unquestionably negligent as well, the 47-53 apportionment of liability was not contrary to the clear weight of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Excessiveness</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Supreme Court's holding in <i>Gasperini v. Center for Humanities, Inc.,</i> 518 U.S. 415, 116 S.Ct. 2211, 135 L.Ed.2d 659 (1996), federal courts sitting in diversity must apply state substantive law standards in reviewing jury awards if the state law departs from the federal standards for judging excessiveness. <i>See id.</i> at 431 (\"<i>Erie</i> [<i>R.R. Co. v. Tompkins,</i> 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938),] precludes a recovery in federal court significantly larger than the recovery that would have been tolerated in state court.\"). Emphasizing that the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has reduced damages awards to victims of medical malpractice to conform to its own precedent, HIMA maintains that the district court was obligated under <i>Gasperini</i> to reduce the plaintiffs' award to conform with Puerto Rico precedent. The district court rejected this argument in a post-verdict ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have previously rejected the argument that <i>Gasperini</i> requires federal district courts to review damages awards for consistency with awards approved by the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico in similar cases. As we have explained, <i>Gasperini</i> would control if state law departed from the ordinary practice of reviewing awards under the federal standards for judging excessiveness, but Puerto Rico law \"suggests no such departure.\" <i>Grajales-Romero,</i> 194 F.3d at 300 (internal quotation marks omitted); <i>see also Mejias Quiros v. Maxxam Prop. Corp.,</i> 108 F.3d 425, 427 n. 1 (1st Cir.1997) (same); <i>cf. Stewart v. Tupperware Corp.,</i> 356 F.3d 335, 339 (1st Cir.2004) (applying <i>Grajales-Romero</i> to the amount-in-controversy determination for purposes of diversity jurisdiction).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Emphasizing that none of the cases in which we have rejected <i>Gasperini</i> arguments involved medical malpractice claims, HIMA asserts that <i>Gasperini</i> requires a remittitur of damages here despite our extant case law. HIMA's argument is based primarily on <i>Nieves Cruz v. Universidad de Puerto Rico,</i> 151 P.R. Dec. 150 (2000), a case in which the Puerto Rico Supreme Court remitted a $3.9 million award to a minor plaintiff who, like Fabiola, suffered from severe hypoxia during childbirth. In reducing the original judgment by approximately 50%, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court explained that it was \"[f]ollowing the parameters of ... precedent.\" <i>Id.</i> (certified translation). The precedent on which the <i>Nieves</i> court relied was <i>Riley v. Rodriguez De Pacheco,</i> 119 P.R. Dec. 762, 1987 WL 448254 (1987), in which the court reduced a damages award in a medical malpractice case because \"[w]ithout certain reasonable limits, the compensation would cease to have the characteristic of compensation [and would] become punitive\" (quoted in <i>Nieves,</i> 151 P.R. Dec. 150 (certified translation)). HIMA contends that <i>Nieves</i> reflects a Puerto Rico standard for reviewing damages awards in medical malpractice cases that differs from the federal standard of reviewing to determine whether an award is \"grossly excessive,\" and that <i>Gasperini</i> requires us to adopt the Puerto Rico standard in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We view this issue as a close one. As HIMA emphasizes, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has remitted a damages award in at least two medical malpractice cases to conform with the <i>Riley</i> precedent. <i>See Nieves,</i> 151 P.R. Dec. 150; <i>Bl&#225;s Toledo v. Hospital Nuestra Senora De La Guadalupe,</i> 146 P.R. Dec. 267, 1998 WL 476260 (1998). On the other hand, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has indicated that it \"will not intervene in the decision on the estimation of damages issued by the lower courts, unless the amounts granted are ridiculously low or exaggeratedly high.\" <i>Nieves,</i> 151 P.R. Dec. 150, 2000 WL 731789 (certified translation). Puerto Rico's \"exaggeratedly high\" standard echoes the federal \"grossly excessive\" standard. That consonance distinguishes this case from <i>Gasperini,</i> which involved a New York law that empowered state courts to reduce any damages award that \"deviates materially from what would be reasonable compensation.\" 518 U.S. at 418, 116 S.Ct. 2211. The Supreme Court emphasized that New York's \"deviates materially\" rule entailed \"[m]ore rigorous comparative evaluations\" than the federal standard and that it had a \"manifestly substantive\" objective. <i>Id.</i> at 429, 116 S.Ct. 2211. Unlike New York's \"deviates materially\" standard, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's standard has been expressed in terms similar to the federal standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, therefore, we are unable to conclude that the remittiturs in <i>Blas Toledo</i> and <i>Nieves</i> mean that the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has adopted a more rigorous standard of review for medical malpractice damages that is tantamount to a substantive rule of law that must be applied in diversity cases. That is, we cannot say, on the basis of the available precedents, that Puerto Rico case law suggests a \"departure from [the] ordinary practice of reviewing awards under the federal standards for judging excessiveness.\" <i>Grajales-Romero,</i> 194 F.3d at 300 (internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration in original). In the absence of such a departure, <i>Gasperini</i> controls. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting HIMA's claim that the damages awarded to the plaintiffs were excessive. \"[A] party seeking remittitur bears a heavy burden of showing that an award is grossly excessive, inordinate, shocking to the conscience of the court, or so high that it would be a denial of justice to permit it to stand.\" <i>Currier v. United Techs. Corp.,</i> 393 F.3d 246, 256 (1st Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). As the district court recognized, the plaintiffs presented ample evidence of the severe physical and emotional toll that Fabiola's permanent injuries have inflicted, and will continue to inflict, on both her and her family. Woodrich testified that Fabiola's life-care plan alone had a cost of approximately $1.9 million. The plaintiffs also presented evidence that Fabiola's loss of potential income was approximately $350,000, and that Fabiola and her parents suffered severe pain and anguish as a result of her injuries. In light of this evidence, the jury awarded $4 million to Fabiola, $1 million to her mother, and $500,000 to her father.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Moreover, HIMA conceded at trial that it had \"presented no evidence to offset Fabiola's and her family's damages. We agree that she has suffered serious damages, both the baby and the family. Our sole issues with the damages is not to negate [their] existence, but to make clear that it was Dr. Pedro Rold&#225;n, and not HIMA, [who was] the responsible party.\" In light of this concession, together with the evidence offered at trial, an award of $5.5 million (of which HIMA will pay $2.585 million) does not shock the conscience. <i>See Muniz,</i> 373 F.3d at 6 (upholding a medical malpractice award of $2 million to a minor who suffered nerve damage to his arm and shoulder at birth).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The record does include a form that purports to be Nurse Marrero's recording of the fetal heart rate every 30 minutes based on the monitor's digital display.

Airlines,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198693\"><a href=\"/opinion/198693/grajales-romero-v-american-airlines/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">288</span></a></span>, 292 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the morning of September 14, 2000, plaintiff Maria Marcano Rivera (\"Marcano\") was admitted to HIMA, a hospital in Caguas, Puerto Rico, pursuant to her obstetrician's decision to induce labor. The obstetrician, Dr. Rold&#225;n, was not an employee of HIMA but had privileges there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At 10 a.m., HIMA nurses attached Marcano to a fetal monitor, which monitors both the fetus's heart rate and the mother's uterine contractions. A fetal monitor provides a digital display of the fetal heart rate and prints out a paper record, known as a tracing, of the heart rate and the contractions. HIMA protocol dictates that nurses check the fetal monitor and record the fetal heart rate every 15 minutes during high-risk deliveries, including induced labor. HIMA protocol also provides that the nurse monitoring the delivery is responsible for notifying the physician of any abnormal fetal heart rate or uterine contraction findings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At 11:45 a.m., Dr. Rold&#225;n induced labor by simultaneously administering Oxytocin through an intravenous drip and inserting in Marcano's vagina a 100 mcg tablet of Cytotec from his personal supply. Dr. Rold&#225;n's simultaneous administration of the two drugs was contrary to HIMA protocol and medical standards established by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (\"ACOG\"). Both Oxytocin and Cytotec stimulate uterine contractions; together they have a multiplier effect and can produce contractions that are too intense or too close together, thereby decreasing the flow of oxygen to the fetus. ACOG thus recommends a four-hour waiting period between administering Oxytocin and Cytotec. Moreover, the recommended dose of Cytotec &#8212; when taken alone &#8212; is only 25 mcg. The higher 100 meg dose administered by Dr. Rold&#225;n also risks producing contractions which are too intense or too close together.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after Dr. Rold&#225;n administered the drugs, he left Marcano's room. Marcano soon began to feel intense contractions. Although she rang the nurse call button repeatedly, the nurse monitoring the delivery, Brenda Marrero, did not respond.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Marcano's husband, Jorge Rodr&#237;guez Matos (\"Rodr&#237;guez\"), joined her at approximately 2:30 p.m., he found her in a desperate state because of frequent contractions. She told him that the contractions were not like the ones she experienced with the delivery of her first child and that she could not stand the pain. Rodr&#237;guez went to the nurses' station and asked them to summon Dr. Rold&#225;n. At approximately 2:45, Dr. Rold&#225;n returned to Marcano's room and administered Demerol, a pain killer. He remained in the room throughout the rest of the delivery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Oddly, the tracing from the fetal heart rate monitor is missing for the period between 10 a.m. and 3:27 p.m., meaning there is no way to evaluate the fetus's heart rate and oxygen supply while Marcano was alone in her hospital room.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The tracing between 3:27 p.m. and 3:45 p.m. appears normal, but that reading does not preclude the possibility that the fetus was deprived of oxygen during the period for which the tracing is missing. Between 3:45 p.m. and 5 p.m., the tracing reveals a continuing pattern of contractions that were too intense and too close together, accompanied by a low fetal heart rate. These factors suggest that the fetus was not receiving sufficient oxygen. The tracing ends at approximately 5 p.m., when Marcano was transferred to the delivery room and the monitor was disconnected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baby Fabiola was born at 6:19 p.m. She was taken immediately to the neonatal intensive care unit, where she was diagnosed with neonatal asphyxia and seizures secondary to neonatal asphyxia, and where she spent approximately two weeks before being discharged to her parents. Marcano and Rodr&#237;guez did not learn until four months later that Fabiola had permanent neurological damage as a result of neonatal asphyxia. Fabiola continues to suffer from daily seizures, and her prognosis is grim. Although she has an anticipated life span of 45 years, she will never see, walk, or communicate, and will require a care-giver for the rest of her life.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Procedural history</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 16, 2002, the plaintiffs sued Dr. Rold&#225;n and HIMA<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> in federal district court for medical malpractice resulting in severe neurological damage to Fabiola. Early in the litigation, the plaintiffs reached a settlement with Dr. Rold&#225;n, who is no longer in practice. Their malpractice claims against HIMA proceeded to trial in October 2003, principally on the theory that HIMA employees failed to adequately monitor the labor and childbirth process and that HIMA's failure contributed to Fabiola's injuries.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Specifically, the plaintiffs suggested that the neurological damage occurred during the period for which the tracing is missing, and that regular monitoring would have alerted Dr. Rold&#225;an to Fabiola's distress in enough time to avert permanent damage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following a five-day trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs. The jury found that both HIMA and Dr. Rold&#225;n had been negligent and that their negligence was the proximate cause of the plaintiffs' damages. It awarded $5.5 million in damages, apportioning 47% of the liability to HIMA and 53% of the liability to Dr. Rold&#225;n. Accordingly, the court entered judgment against HIMA for $2.585 million (<i>i.e.,</i> 47% of $5.5 million). The court subsequently denied HIMA's post-verdict motion for judgment as a matter of law, a new trial on apportionment of liability, or remittitur.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">HIMA raises several arguments on appeal. First, it asserts that the district court erred in denying its motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50. Second, it assigns error to the district court's decision to admit testimony by one of the plaintiffs' expert witnesses. Finally, HIMA contends that the district court abused its discretion in failing to grant its motion for a new trial or remittitur under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59. We consider these claims in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While conceding that Fabiola suffered permanent neurological damage during birth, HIMA argues that the evidence at trial was insufficient to allow a reasonable jury to conclude that the damage was causally linked to negligent monitoring. The district court rejected this argument in denying a post-verdict motion for judgment as a matter of law, concluding that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">there was ample evidence presented to the jury, which if believed, could sustain a finding that HIMA was indeed negligent in monitoring plaintiff's labor and that said negligence proximately caused the alleged injuries.... [T]he jury heard evidence that the monitoring was done every thirty minutes as opposed to every 15 minutes, as was standard in induced labors. Most importantly, the jury was allowed to make reasonable inferences from the fact that a significant portion of the tracing of the fetal heart rate and uterine contractions monitoring machine was missing, and HIMA was unable to give any explanation therefor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A party seeking to overturn a jury verdict faces an uphill battle. \"Courts may only grant a judgment contravening a jury's determination when the evidence points so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of the moving party that no reasonable jury could have returned a verdict adverse to that party.\" <i>Rivera Castillo v.

The standard is a national one, and ordinarily must be demonstrated through expert testimony. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Jose Juan Gorr&#237;n Peralta (\"Dr.Gorr&#237;n\"), explained that the standard of care requires monitoring high-risk deliveries, including induced labor, every 15 minutes. Monitoring includes evaluating both the fetal heart rate and uterine contraction information provided by the fetal monitor's paper tracings and the fetal heart rate information provided by the fetal monitor's digital display. Monitoring is a shared responsibility of the doctor and the nurse; when the doctor is not present, the nurse is in charge of the monitoring. Dr. Gorr&#237;n's testimony on this point was corroborated by HIMA's expert, Dr. Jos&#233; Vargas Cordero, who testified that when the doctor is not present, the nurse is in charge of checking both the tracing and the digital monitor, and that if the nurse notices an abnormal reading, she must call the doctor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that HIMA failed to monitor Marcano's labor in accordance with the national standard of care. It is undisputed that Nurse Marrero checked the fetal monitor's digital heart rate display at most every 30 minutes, instead of every 15 minutes as Dr. Gorr&#237;n testified was standard. Indeed, the jury may have concluded that Nurse Marrero did not even check the fetal heart rate monitor every 30 minutes. Dr. Gorr&#237;n testified that the fetal heart rates recorded by Marrero \"are totally out of context not only to the part of the fetal heart rate tracing which we did get an opportunity to evaluate, but of the catastrophic condition of the baby when she was born,\" implying that Marrero may have falsified the record. Moreover, Marcano testified that she was alone in the hospital room between 11:45 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. &#8212; a period of nearly three hours &#8212; and that nurses failed to respond when she repeatedly attempted to summon them during that time. Based on this testimony, the jury could reasonably have concluded that Marrero failed to adequately monitor the labor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Causation</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To establish causation under Puerto Rico law, \"[a] plaintiff must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the physician's negligent conduct was the factor that `most probably' caused harm to the plaintiff.\" <i>Lama,</i> 16 F.3d at 478 (quoting <i>Sierra Perez v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2313840\"><a href=\"/opinion/2313840/sierra-perez-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">779</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">637</span></a></span>, 643 (D.P.R.1991)). While this causation standard does not require all other causes of damage to be eliminated, \"a jury normally cannot find causation based on mere speculation and conjecture; expert testimony is generally essential.\" <i>Id.; see also Rojas-Ithier,</i> 394 F.3d at 43 (\"[A] factfinder normally cannot find causation without the assistance of expert testimony to clarify complex medical and scientific issues that are more prevalent in medical malpractice cases than in standard negligence cases.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">HIMA argues that there was insufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that its negligent monitoring was \"most probably\" the factor that caused Fabiola to be injured during her delivery. It contends that the evidence demonstrated instead that Fabiola's injuries were mostly likely the result of Dr. Rold&#225;n's negligence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue of causation is complicated in this case by the disappearance of the fetal monitor tracing for the period between 10 a.m. and 3:27 p.m. Experts for both parties agree that Fabiola's heart rate was in the normal range for a short time after 3:27, when the tracing begins, and that it dropped perilously low at approximately 5 p.m., shortly before the tracing ends. The experts also agree that the low heart rate reading at 5 p.m. indicates that Fabiola was in distress and that Dr. Rold&#225;n, who was present at the time, should have taken steps immediately to ameliorate the situation. Such steps would have included turning off the Oxytocin drip to reduce the strength and frequency of contractions, turning Marcano on her side to increase the flow of oxygen to the fetus, administering oxygen to Marcano, and, if those measures failed, performing a cesarean section. It is undisputed that Dr. Rold&#225;n took none of these steps; by the time Fabiola was born at 6:19 p.m., she was suffering from neonatal asphyxia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">HIMA's medical experts testified that because the fetal monitor indicated a normal heart rate at 3:27 p.m. and an ominously low heart rate at 5 p.m., Fabiola's injuries must have occurred sometime between 3:27 p.m. and 6:19 p.m. Emphasizing that Dr. Rold&#225;n was present throughout that period and failed to act, HIMA argues that Fabiola's injuries are directly attributable to the doctor's failure to intervene and that any failure of monitoring before 3:27 p.m. did not cause the asphyxia. HIMA further contends that without the tracing for the period before 3:27 p.m., any conclusion that the injury occurred during that period would be based on impermissible speculation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">HIMA is correct that, without the missing tracing, it is impossible to know with certainty whether the fetus was in distress before 3:27 p.m. &#8212; or, more particularly, between 11:45 a.m., when Dr. Rold&#225;n induced the labor and left a nurse in charge of the monitoring, and 2:45 p.m., when Dr. Rold&#225;n returned to Marcano's bedside to supervise the delivery. It does not follow, however, that no reasonable jury could find that negligent monitoring during that period most probably caused or contributed to Fabiola's injuries. Although HIMA's experts testified that the normal fetal heart rate at 3:27 p.m. indicated a smooth process up to that point, the plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Gorr&#237;n, took a different position. He testified that a normal fetal heart rate at 3:27 p.m. does not rule out the possibility that the fetus was in distress earlier:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The baby could have had an hypoxic episode producing asphyxia, and mother nature will try to preserve life, and the baby's heart will not necessarily stay at [the below-normal rate of] 60 beats per minute or the baby might not even die if he was severely asphyxiated during a window of time when he or she was subjected not to one, but to two medications, one of which at a very excessive dose and another one at a dose we'll never know about, without monitoring. I cannot say just because there was an 18-minute window [between 3:27 p.m. and 3:45 p.m.] with an adequate baseline fetal heart rate that nothing else happened before [the beginning of the tracing at 3:27 p.m.].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Gorr&#237;n's testimony that the fetus may have been deprived of oxygen between 11:45 a.m. and 3:27 p.m. is consistent with the evidence presented about the effects of Oxytocin and Cytotec, the drugs Dr. Rold&#225;n used to induce labor. Experts for both parties testified that it is contraindicated to administer Oxytocin and Cytotec simultaneously because, in the words of Dr. Gorr&#237;n,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the synergistic effect of one drug, which acts to produce uterine contractions on top of another, which also acts to produce uterine contractions, will cause something like adding two plus two and getting five instead of four ... One thing works with the other, and the lump effect is a lot more than just the sum of each one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The experts also testified that contractions that are too intense or too frequent can deprive the fetus of oxygen and lead to a depressed heart rate. Shockingly, Dr. Rold&#225;n administered both Oxytocin and Cytotec simultaneously, and he administered four times the appropriate dose of Cytotec.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Marcano's testimony, the intense contractions began almost immediately after Dr. Rold&#225;n administered the drugs at 11:45 a.m., and continued until at least 2:45 p.m., when her husband summoned Dr. Rold&#225;n to return to the room. That timing is consistent with Dr. Gorr&#237;n's testimony that Oxytocin would exert its effect within ten minutes of being administered and that Cytotec, if placed in the vagina as it was here, would also exert its effect in a short while. That timing is also consistent with ACOG's recommendation that doctors wait four hours between administering Oxytocin and Cytotec; the waiting period suggests that either drug exerts its strongest effects in the hours immediately after it is administered. A reasonable jury could therefore have concluded that Marcano suffered the most intense and frequent contractions beginning shortly after 11:45 a.m., that the missing tracing would reveal that Fabiola was deprived of oxygen during this period, and that negligent monitoring between 11:45 a.m. and Dr. Rold&#225;n's return at 2:45 p.m. caused or contributed to Fabiola's injuries. Although HIMA's experts testified that the damage occurred later, such contradictory expert testimony \"does nothing to vitiate the sufficiency of the plaintiff's proof.\" <i>Muniz v. Rovira,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 5 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs introduced sufficient evidence to support a finding that negligent monitoring on the part of HIMA caused Fabiola's injuries.

Admission of Expert Testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs offered testimony at trial by life-care planner Frank Woodrich regarding the projected cost of Fabiola's future care. HIMA objected to Woodrich's testimony, both through a motion in limine and at trial, arguing that Woodrich's methodology, the foundation for his testimony, was not reliable. The court denied the motion in limine without explanation. In response to the renewed objection at the outset of Woodrich's testimony, the court allowed HIMA to conduct a brief voir dire of Woodrich. After a series of questions focusing on Woodrich's failure to have a physician review his projections regarding Fabiola's future medical needs, HIMA moved again to strike Woodrich as an expert. The district court overruled the motion, commenting that \"what you're doing is going to the weight, not to the expertise.\" HIMA argues that the district court's ruling was erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The admission of expert testimony is governed by Federal Rule of Evidence 702, which requires that \"(1) the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.\" Rule 702 \"imposes a gate-keeping function on the trial judge to ensure that an expert's testimony `both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.'\" <i>United States v.

Woodrich also testified that his proposed care plan for Fabiola was based on a review of records from the agency providing her with skilled nursing care, a letter from her physician, and an interview of Fabiola's family and caregiver. Although Woodrich's report might have benefitted from a physician's review of the projections regarding Fabiola's future needs, the court did not abuse its discretion in determining that Woodrich's methodology was sufficiently reliable for admissibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Motion for a New Trial or Remittitur</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, HIMA claims that the district court erred in denying its motion for new trial or remittitur under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59. \"A district court should only grant such motions if the outcome is against the clear weight of the evidence such that upholding the verdict will result in a miscarriage of justice.\" <i>Johnson v.

Our review is for an abuse of discretion. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Apportionment of Liability</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">HIMA contends that even if its negligent monitoring played a role in Fabiola's injuries, its negligence was far outweighed by Dr. Rold&#225;n's negligence in inducing and handling the labor. As such, HIMA maintains, there was insufficient evidence to support a jury finding that it was liable for 47% of the damage and it is entitled to a new trial on apportionment of liability. The district court rejected this argument, ruling that \"the plaintiff's expert witness and several documents admitted into evidence\" supported a finding that HIMA's negligence caused 47% of the plaintiffs' damages. We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a repeat of their argument that there was insufficient evidence that the hospital caused or contributed to Fabiola's injuries, HIMA argues that without the missing tracing, any evidence that Fabiola was deprived of oxygen while the nurse was responsible for monitoring in Dr. Rold&#225;n's absence (<i>i.e.,</i> between 11:45 a.m. and 2:45 p.m.) is impermissible speculation. That reasoning would have the effect of punishing the plaintiffs for HIMA's failure to produce the tracing, and we reject it again. Although there is no way to know for certain what happened between 11:45 a.m. and 2:45 p.m. without the tracing, the circumstantial evidence, together with Dr. Gorr&#237;n's expert testimony, would allow a reasonable jury to find that Marcano's strong contractions between 11:45 a.m. and 2:45 p.m. deprived Fabiola of oxygen and that HIMA's negligent monitoring during that period deprived Dr. Rold&#225;n of an opportunity to intervene before Fabiola suffered permanent damage. While Dr. Rold&#225;n was unquestionably negligent as well, the 47-53 apportionment of liability was not contrary to the clear weight of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Excessiveness</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Supreme Court's holding in <i>Gasperini v.

Emphasizing that the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has reduced damages awards to victims of medical malpractice to conform to its own precedent, HIMA maintains that the district court was obligated under <i>Gasperini</i> to reduce the plaintiffs' award to conform with Puerto Rico precedent. The district court rejected this argument in a post-verdict ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have previously rejected the argument that <i>Gasperini</i> requires federal district courts to review damages awards for consistency with awards approved by the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico in similar cases. As we have explained, <i>Gasperini</i> would control if state law departed from the ordinary practice of reviewing awards under the federal standards for judging excessiveness, but Puerto Rico law \"suggests no such departure.\" <i>Grajales-Romero,</i> 194 F.3d at 300 (internal quotation marks omitted); <i>see also Mejias Quiros v.

HIMA's argument is based primarily on <i>Nieves Cruz v. Universidad de Puerto Rico,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">151</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Dec.</span> <span class=\"page\">150</span></span> (2000), a case in which the Puerto Rico Supreme Court remitted a $3.9 million award to a minor plaintiff who, like Fabiola, suffered from severe hypoxia during childbirth. In reducing the original judgment by approximately 50%, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court explained that it was \"[f]ollowing the parameters of ... precedent.\" <i>Id.</i> (certified translation). The precedent on which the <i>Nieves</i> court relied was <i>Riley v. Rodriguez De Pacheco,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Dec.</span> <span class=\"page\">762</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">448254</span></span> (1987), in which the court reduced a damages award in a medical malpractice case because \"[w]ithout certain reasonable limits, the compensation would cease to have the characteristic of compensation [and would] become punitive\" (quoted in <i>Nieves,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">151</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Dec.</span> <span class=\"page\">150</span></span> (certified translation)). HIMA contends that <i>Nieves</i> reflects a Puerto Rico standard for reviewing damages awards in medical malpractice cases that differs from the federal standard of reviewing to determine whether an award is \"grossly excessive,\" and that <i>Gasperini</i> requires us to adopt the Puerto Rico standard in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We view this issue as a close one. As HIMA emphasizes, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has remitted a damages award in at least two medical malpractice cases to conform with the <i>Riley</i> precedent. <i>See Nieves,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">151</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Dec.</span> <span class=\"page\">150</span></span>; <i>Bl&#225;s Toledo v. Hospital Nuestra Senora De La Guadalupe,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Dec.</span> <span class=\"page\">267</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">476260</span></span> (1998). On the other hand, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has indicated that it \"will not intervene in the decision on the estimation of damages issued by the lower courts, unless the amounts granted are ridiculously low or exaggeratedly high.\" <i>Nieves,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">151</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Dec.</span> <span class=\"page\">150</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">731789</span></span> (certified translation). Puerto Rico's \"exaggeratedly high\" standard echoes the federal \"grossly excessive\" standard. That consonance distinguishes this case from <i>Gasperini,</i> which involved a New York law that empowered state courts to reduce any damages award that \"deviates materially from what would be reasonable compensation.\" 518 U.S. at 418, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2528498\"><a href=\"/opinion/2528498/gasperini-v-center-for-humanities-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2211</span></a></span>. The Supreme Court emphasized that New York's \"deviates materially\" rule entailed \"[m]ore rigorous comparative evaluations\" than the federal standard and that it had a \"manifestly substantive\" objective. <i>Id.</i> at 429, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2528498\"><a href=\"/opinion/2528498/gasperini-v-center-for-humanities-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2211</span></a></span>. Unlike New York's \"deviates materially\" standard, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's standard has been expressed in terms similar to the federal standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, therefore, we are unable to conclude that the remittiturs in <i>Blas Toledo</i> and <i>Nieves</i> mean that the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has adopted a more rigorous standard of review for medical malpractice damages that is tantamount to a substantive rule of law that must be applied in diversity cases. That is, we cannot say, on the basis of the available precedents, that Puerto Rico case law suggests a \"departure from [the] ordinary practice of reviewing awards under the federal standards for judging excessiveness.\" <i>Grajales-Romero,</i> 194 F.3d at 300 (internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration in original). In the absence of such a departure, <i>Gasperini</i> controls. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting HIMA's claim that the damages awarded to the plaintiffs were excessive. \"[A] party seeking remittitur bears a heavy burden of showing that an award is grossly excessive, inordinate, shocking to the conscience of the court, or so high that it would be a denial of justice to permit it to stand.\" <i>Currier v. United Techs. Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201387\"><a href=\"/opinion/201387/currier-v-united-technologies/\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">246</span></a></span>, 256 (1st Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). As the district court recognized, the plaintiffs presented ample evidence of the severe physical and emotional toll that Fabiola's permanent injuries have inflicted, and will continue to inflict, on both her and her family. Woodrich testified that Fabiola's life-care plan alone had a cost of approximately $1.9 million. The plaintiffs also presented evidence that Fabiola's loss of potential income was approximately $350,000, and that Fabiola and her parents suffered severe pain and anguish as a result of her injuries. In light of this evidence, the jury awarded $4 million to Fabiola, $1 million to her mother, and $500,000 to her father.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Moreover, HIMA conceded at trial that it had \"presented no evidence to offset Fabiola's and her family's damages. We agree that she has suffered serious damages, both the baby and the family. Our sole issues with the damages is not to negate [their] existence, but to make clear that it was Dr. Pedro Rold&#225;n, and not HIMA, [who was] the responsible party.\" In light of this concession, together with the evidence offered at trial, an award of $5.5 million (of which HIMA will pay $2.585 million) does not shock the conscience. <i>See Muniz,</i> 373 F.3d at 6 (upholding a medical malpractice award of $2 million to a minor who suffered nerve damage to his arm and shoulder at birth).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The record does include a form that purports to be Nurse Marrero's recording of the fetal heart rate every 30 minutes based on the monitor's digital display.

The jury also heard testimony of Hayd&#233;e Costas, an expert in psychiatry, who diagnosed Maria Yolanda Marcano as suffering from a major depression.
