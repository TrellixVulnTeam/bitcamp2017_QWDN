Nathaniel M. Gorton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                      Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                 Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                   and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Gary H. Goldberg for appellant.\n     Michael D. Badger with whom D. M. Moschos and         Mirick,\nO'Connell, DeMallie & Lougee were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                       September 27, 2002\n\f     Per curiam.       Following a refusal of appellant Amalgamated\n\nTransit Union, Local 22 (\"Local 22\") in February 2001 to work\novertime, appellee RTA Transit Services, Inc., (\"RTA\") sought\n\ninjunctive     and   declaratory   relief.      The     parties    subsequently\nentered   into   a    stipulation,   accepted      by   the   district   court,\nagreeing not to engage in future work stoppages and to submit all\n\ncomplaints of alleged violations of the collective bargaining\nagreement to grievance and arbitration procedures consistent with\n\nthe arbitration clause of the collective bargaining agreement.                 In\n\nNovember 2001, RTA sought to hold Local 22 in contempt for another\nrefusal   to   work   overtime.      The   court    found     an   illegal   work\nstoppage, but did not impose a sanction and warned that it would\n\nimpose a substantial fine \"if this happens again.\"\n     In January 2002, RTA, carrying out an ordered realignment and\nreduction of bus routes, alleged violations of both the prior\n\nstipulation and the collective bargaining agreement through a\nrefusal of Local 22 to complete a required re-rating, and filed an\nemergency motion for contempt.       Local 22 filed an emergency motion\n\nto compel arbitration on the issue of whether it was required to\nconduct the re-rating under the circumstances, claiming that it did\n\nnot have the requisite documentation from RTA. Hearing was held on\nboth motions and affidavits submitted.\n\n     Following the hearing, the district court issued an order on\nJanuary 24, 2002, which in relevant part required (1) Local 22 to\n\ncomplete the re-rating process by January 31, 2002, in default of\n\nwhich action monetary sanctions would be imposed, and (2) both\n\n                                     -2-\n\fparties to submit alleged grievances relating to the collective\nbargaining agreement to expedited arbitration.\n\n     Local 22 completed the re-rating as ordered and no sanctions\n\nwere imposed. On January 30, the district court denied Local 22's\nmotion to compel arbitration or, in the alternative, to clarify its\n\nre-rating order, wherein Local 22 specifically asked \"whether or\n\nnot the Court is precluding an arbitrator from deciding whether the\n\nUnion    is    required       to   perform    a    re-rating        if   other   related\n\nprovisions         of   the   contract       are     being    violated.\"     Local      22\n\nsubsequently appealed both orders.\n\n        Meanwhile,      arbitration      proceedings         were    initiated    and    a\n\nhearing held on other grievance matters.                        The arbitrator has\nrefused Local 22's request to rule on the issue of                         whether the\n\nJanuary       22    re-rating      should     have     been    required     under    the\n\ncircumstances, on the basis that he has no authority to overrule a\ndistrict court order.           Local 22 subsequently renewed its motion to\n\ncompel in the district court, asking the court once again to send\n\nthe January re-rating issue to the arbitrator. On September 4, the\ndistrict court issued its response, declining to rule pending this\n\ncourt's decision.\n\n        In view of the above, we conclude that although the court in\n\nits order of January 24, 2002, found Local 22 in contempt, that\n\ncontempt was purged by Local 22's completion of the re-rating as\n\nordered.      Thus, the issue of the validity of the contempt portions\n\nof the court's orders is moot.               Having no appellate jurisdiction,\n\nwe refrain from any judgment.\n\n\n                                            -3-\n\f      Nevertheless, Local 22 also seeks a ruling from this court on\nthe   validity        of   the    district     court's   decision     to   assume\n\njurisdiction over the underlying issue, namely, whether Local 22\n\nwas required to do the January re-rating pursuant to the collective\nbargaining agreement. The unusual procedural posture of this case,\n\nhowever, complicates this court's ability to respond.                 Whether or\n\nnot the January 30 order of the district court, refusing to clarify\n\nits January      24    order     or   compel   arbitration,   would   have   been\n\nappealable to this court, the subsequent actions of the parties,\n\nseeking further rulings from both the arbitrator and the district\n\ncourt, complicate the problem.\n\n      Although the arbitrator is currently seized of a number of\nissues that will be subject to judicial review upon conclusion, he\n\nhas already ruled that he will not revisit this issue. The district\n\ncourt, however, has not reached a final decision on Local 22's\nsubsequent renewed request that the issue be sent to arbitration.\n\n      In this posture of the case, it seems to us in the interests\n\nof expedition and judicial economy to give the district court\nfreedom to address Local 22's request and bring this phase of\n\nlitigation to completion. We therefore retain jurisdiction pending\n\nthe district court's final order on Local 22's renewed motion\nrequesting that the district court send this issue to arbitration.\n\nThe parties, and the district court, are directed to notify the\nclerk of this court when the district court rules.               If no request\n\nfor further appellate review is received within thirty days of that\n\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fruling, the remainder of this appeal will be dismissed without\nprejudice and without the assessment of costs.\n\n     Appeal dismissed in part. Jurisdiction retained pending final\n\ndisposition by the district court.\n\n\n\n\n                               -5-\n\f",
