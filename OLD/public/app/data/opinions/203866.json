In April 2006, Joseph Melfi\n\nrefinanced his home mortgage with WMC Mortgage Corporation (\"WMC\").\n\nAt the closing, Melfi received from WMC a notice of his right to\n\nrescind the transaction.           The notice is required for such a\n\ntransaction by the Truth in Lending Act (\"TILA\"), 15 U.S.C. §\n\n1635(a) (2006).       Assuming that the notice complies with TILA, a\n\nborrower is given three \"business days\" to rescind the transaction;\n\notherwise, the period is much longer.            Id.     The question in this\n\ncase is whether the notice given Melfi adequately complied.\n\n              The three-day period aims \"to give the consumer the\n\nopportunity to reconsider any transaction which would have the\n\nserious consequence of encumbering the title to his [or her] home.\"\n\nS. Rep. No. 96-368, at 28 (1979), reprinted in 1980 U.S.C.C.A.N.\n\n236,   264.      Under   TILA,   the     requirements    for   the   notice   are\n\nestablished by the Federal Reserve Board (\"the Board\") in its\n\nRegulation Z.        12 C.F.R. § 226.23 (2007).           Failure to provide\n\nproper notice extends to three years the borrower's deadline to\n\nrescind.      Id. § 226.23 (a)(3).\n\n              About 20 months after the closing, Melfi attempted to\n\nrescind the transaction.         The incentives for a borrower to do so\n\nmay be substantial where a new loan is available, especially if\n\nrates have fallen or substantial interest has been paid during the\n\nperiod   of    the   original    loan.       \"When   a   consumer    rescinds   a\n\ntransaction . . . the consumer shall not be liable for any amount,\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fincluding any finance charge\" and \"the creditor shall return any\n\nmoney or property that has been given to anyone in connection with\n\nthe transaction . . . .\"      12 C.F.R. 226.23(d)(1), (2).\n\n            Melfi argued that the notice of his right to cancel was\n\ndeficient because it left blank the spaces for the date of the\n\ntransaction (although the date was stamped on the top right corner\n\nof the notice) and the actual deadline to rescind.             WMC and co-\n\ndefendants Deutsche Bank and Wells Fargo (the loan's trustee and\n\nservicer, respectively) refused to allow the rescission, and Melfi\n\nthen brought this action in the federal district court in Rhode\n\nIsland.\n\n            The district court, following our decision in Palmer v.\n\nChampion Mortgage, 465 F.3d 24 (1st Cir. 2006), asked whether a\n\nborrower of average intelligence would be confused by the Notice.\n\nMelfi v. WMC Mortgage Corp., No. 08-024ML, 2009 WL 64338, at *1\n\n(D.R.I. Jan. 9, 2009).      The court ruled that even if the omissions\n\nin   the   notice   were   violations,   they   were   at   most   technical\n\nviolations that did not give rise to an extended rescission period\n\nbecause the notice was clear and conspicuous despite the omissions,\n\nand it dismissed Melfi's complaint.        Id. at *3.\n\n            Melfi now appeals.    Our review is de novo, accepting all\n\nof the well-pleaded facts in the complaint as true and drawing\n\nreasonable inferences in favor of Melfi.          Andrew Robinson Int'l,\n\nInc. v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., 547 F.3d 48, 51 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fWe may consider materials incorporated in the complaint (here, the\n\nnotice Melfi received) and also facts subject to judicial notice.\n\nIn re Colonial Mortgage Bankers Corp., 324 F.3d 12, 14 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).\n\n           TILA provides that \"[t]he creditor shall clearly and\n\nconspicuously disclose, in accordance with regulations of the\n\nBoard, to any obligor [here, Melfi] in a transaction subject to\n\nthis section the rights of the obligor under this section.\"          15\n\nU.S.C. § 1635(a).      Regulation Z says what the notice of the right\n\nto cancel must clearly and conspicuously disclose;         pertinently,\n\nthe regulation requires that the notice include \"[t]he date the\n\nrescission    period   expires.\"    12   C.F.R.   §   226.23(b)(1)(v).\n\n           The Board has created a model form; a creditor must\n\nprovide either the model form or a \"substantially similar notice.\"\n\n12 C.F.R. § 226.23(b)(2).     The use of the model form insulates the\n\ncreditor from most insufficient disclosure claims.          15 U.S.C. §\n\n1604(b).     WMC gave Melfi the model form, but the spaces left for\n\nthe date of the transaction and the date of the rescission deadline\n\nwere not filled in.      The form Melfi received had the date of the\n\ntransaction stamped at its top (but it was not so designated) and\n\nthen read in part:\n\n                  You are entering into a transaction\n           that will result in a mortgage/lien/security\n           interest on your home. You have a legal right\n           under federal law to cancel this transaction,\n           without cost, within THREE BUSINESS DAYS from\n           whichever of the following events occurs LAST:\n\n                                   -4-\n\f                       (1) The date of the transaction,\n                       which is ____________ ; or\n                       (2) The date you receive your\n           Truth in Lending disclosures; or\n                       (3) The date you received this\n           notice of your right to cancel.\n\n           . . . .\n\n           HOW TO CANCEL\n\n           If you decide to cancel this transaction, you\n           may do so by notifying us in writing. . . .\n\n           You may use any written statement that is\n           signed and dated by you and states your\n           intention to cancel and/or you may use this\n           notice by dating and signing below. Keep one\n           copy of this notice because it contains\n           important information about your rights.\n\n           If you cancel by mail or telegram, you must\n           send the notice no later than MIDNIGHT of\n           _____________ (or MIDNIGHT of the THIRD\n           BUSINESS DAY following the latest of the three\n           events listed above). If you send or deliver\n           your written notice to cancel some other way,\n           it must be delivered to the above address no\n           later than that time.\n           . . . .\n\n           Melfi's   argument   is   straightforward.   Regulation   Z\n\nrequires in substance the deadline for rescission be provided; one\n\nof the three measuring dates--the date of the transaction--was left\n\nblank (the other two are described but have no blanks); and\n\ntherefore the notice was deficient and Melfi has three years to\n\nrescind.   A number of district court cases, along with two circuit\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fcourt opinions, support Melfi's position,1 although one of the\n\ncircuit cases also involved more serious substantive flaws.\n\n          The circuit cases are now elderly and may be in tension\n\nwith later TILA amendments, but the statements that \"technical\"\n\nviolations of TILA are fatal has been echoed in other cases.   This\n\ncircuit took a notably different approach in Palmer to determining\n\nwhether arguable flaws compromised effective disclosure process.\n\nSee also Santos-Rodriguez v. Doral Mortgage Corp., 485 F.3d 12, 17\n\n(1st Cir. 2007).   Following Palmer, district court decisions in\n\nthis circuit concluded that failing to fill in a blank did not\n\nautomatically trigger a right to rescind.2\n\n          In Palmer, the plaintiff received a notice of her right\n\nto cancel that followed the Federal Reserve's model form but the\n\nform was not received until after the rescission deadline listed on\n\nthe notice.   465 F.3d at 27.   Nonetheless, Palmer held that the\n\nnotice \"was crystal clear\" because it included (as in the Federal\n\nReserve's model form) the alternative deadline (not given as a date\n\nbut solely in descriptive form) of three business days following\n\n\n\n     1\n      E.g., Semar v. Platte Valley Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n, 791 F.2d\n699, 702-03 (9th Cir. 1986); Williamson v. Lafferty, 698 F.2d 767,\n768-69 (5th Cir. 1983); Johnson v. Chase Manhattan Bank, USA N.A.,\nNo. 07-526, 2007 WL 2033833, at *3 (E.D. Pa. July 11, 2007);\nReynolds v. D & N Bank, 792 F. Supp. 1035, 1038 (E.D. Mich. 1992).\n     2\n      Bonney v. Wash. Mut. Bank, 596 F. Supp. 2d 173 (D. Mass.\n2009); Megitt v. Indymac Bank, F.S.B., 547 F. Supp. 2d 56 (D. Mass.\n2008); Carye v. Long Beach Mortgage Co., 470 F. Supp. 2d 3 (D.\nMass. 2007).\n\n                                -6-\n\fthe date the notice was received, so the plaintiff still knew that\n\nshe had three days to act.      Id. at 29.\n\n          Palmer did not involve the blank date problem.            Palmer,\n\n465 F.3d at 29.    But the principle on which Palmer rests is broader\n\nthan the precise facts: technical deficiencies do not matter if the\n\nborrower receives a notice that effectively gives him notice as to\n\nthe final date for rescission and has the three full days to act.\n\nOur test is whether any reasonable person, in reading the form\n\nprovided in this case, would so understand it.           Here, the omitted\n\ndates made no difference.\n\n          The date that Melfi closed on the loan can hardly have\n\nbeen unknown to him and was in fact hand stamped or typed on the\n\nform given to him.       From that date, it is easy enough to count\n\nthree days; completing the blank avoids only the risk created by\n\nthe fact that Saturday counts as a business day under Board\n\nregulations, 12 C.F.R. § 226.2(6), and the borrower might think\n\notherwise.   Lafferty, 698 F.2d at 769 n.3 (\"[T]he precise purpose\n\nof requiring the creditor to fill in the date [of the rescission\n\ndeadline] is to prevent the customer from having to calculate three\n\nbusiness days\").\n\n          Nor     does   completing    the   blank   necessarily   tell   the\n\nborrower how long he has to rescind.          Where after the closing the\n\nborrower is mailed either the notice or certain other required\n\ninformation, the three days runs not from the transaction date but\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\ffrom the last date when the borrower receives the notice and other\n\nrequired documents.    Melfi himself says he was given the form on\n\nthe date of the closing and does not claim that there was any\n\npertinent delay in giving him the other required disclosures.            So\n\nthe blanks in no way misled Melfi in this case.\n\n           So   the   argument   for    allowing   Melfi   to   extend   his\n\ndeadline from three days to three years depends on this premise:\n\nthat any flaw or deviation should be penalized automatically in\n\norder to deter such errors in the future.          If Congress had made\n\nsuch a determination as a matter of policy, a court would respect\n\nthat determination; possibly, this would also be so if the Board\n\nhad made the same determination.          See Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v.\n\nNatural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 844 (1984).           Melfi\n\nargues at length that we owe such deference to the Board.\n\n          The answer is that there is no evidence in TILA or any\n\nBoard regulation that either Congress or the Board intended to\n\nrender the form a nullity because of an uncompleted blank in the\n\nform or similar flaw where, as here, it could not possibly have\n\ncaused Melfi to think that he had months in order to rescind.            The\n\ncentral purpose of the disclosure--the short notice period for\n\nrescission at will--was plain despite the blanks. Melfi's argument\n\nassumes, rather than establishes, that a penalty was intended.\n\n          Some cases finding a blank notice form to be grounds for\n\nrescission even though harmless were decided under an earlier\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fversion of TILA.     In 1995, Congress added a new subsection to TILA,\n\ntitled \"Limitation on Rescission Liability.\"         It provided that a\n\nborrower could not rescind \"solely from the form of written notice\n\nused by the creditor . . . if the creditor provided the [borrower]\n\nthe appropriate form of written notice published and adopted by the\n\nBoard . . . .\"    Truth in Lending Act Amendments of 1995, Pub L. No.\n\n104-29, § 5, 109 Stat. 271, 274 (1995) (codified at 15 U.S.C. §\n\n1635(h)).\n\n            Read literally, this safe harbor may not be available to\n\nWMC because, while it used the Board's form of notice, it did not\n\nproperly fill in the blanks.       But the TILA amendments were aimed in\n\ngeneral     to   guard   against   widespread   rescissions   for   minor\n\nviolations. McKenna v. First Horizon Loan Corp., 475 F.3d 418, 424\n\n(1st Cir. 2007).     To this extent, Congress has now leaned against\n\na penalty approach and, perhaps, weakened the present force of the\n\nolder case law favoring extension of the rescission deadline.\n\n            In any event, in the absence of some direction from\n\nCongress or the Board to impose a penalty, we see no policy basis\n\nfor such a result.       Where, as here, the Board's form was used and\n\na reasonable borrower cannot have been misled, allowing a windfall\n\nand imposing a penalty serves no purpose and, further, is at odds\n\nwith the general approach already taken by this court in Palmer.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\f",

At the closing, Melfi received from WMC a notice of his right to rescind the transaction. The notice is required for such a transaction by the Truth in Lending Act (\"TILA\"), 15 U.S.C. § 1635(a) (2006). Assuming that the notice complies with TILA, a borrower is given three \"business days\" to rescind the transaction; otherwise, the period is much longer. <i>Id.</i> The question in this case is whether the notice given Melfi adequately complied.</p>\n<p>The three-day period aims \"to give the consumer the opportunity to reconsider any transaction which would have the serious consequence of encumbering the title to his [or her] home.\" S.Rep. No. 96-368, at 28 (1979), <i>reprinted in</i> 1980 U.S.C.C.A.N. 236, 264. Under TILA, the requirements for the notice are established by the Federal Reserve Board (\"the Board\") in its Regulation Z. 12 C.F.R. § 226.23 (2007). Failure to provide proper notice extends to three years the borrower's deadline to rescind. <i>Id.</i> § 226.23(a)(3).</p>\n<p>About 20 months after the closing, Melfi attempted to rescind the transaction. The incentives for a borrower to do so may be substantial where a new loan is available, especially if rates have fallen or substantial interest has been paid during the period of the original loan. \"When a consumer rescinds a transaction ... the consumer shall not be liable for any amount, including any finance charge\" and \"the creditor shall return any money or property that has been given to anyone in connection with the transaction. ...\" 12 C.F.R. 226.23(d)(1), (2).</p>\n<p>Melfi argued that the notice of his right to cancel was deficient because it left blank the spaces for the date of the transaction (although the date was stamped on the top right corner of the notice) and the actual deadline to rescind. WMC and co-defendants Deutsche Bank and Wells Fargo (the loan's trustee and servicer, respectively) refused to allow the rescission, and Melfi then brought this action in the federal district court in Rhode Island.</p>\n<p>The district court, following our decision in <i>Palmer v. Champion Mortgage,</i> 465 F.3d 24 (1st Cir.2006), asked whether a borrower of average intelligence would be <span class=\"star-pagination\">*311</span> confused by the Notice. <i>Melfi v. WMC Mortgage Corp.,</i> No. 08-024ML, 2009 WL 64338, at *1 (D.R.I. Jan.9, 2009). The court ruled that even if the omissions in the notice were violations, they were at most technical violations that did not give rise to an extended rescission period because the notice was clear and conspicuous despite the omissions, and it dismissed Melfi's complaint. <i>Id.</i> at *3.</p>\n<p>Melfi now appeals. Our review is <i>de novo,</i> accepting all of the well-pleaded facts in the complaint as true and drawing reasonable inferences in favor of Melfi. <i>Andrew Robinson Int'l, Inc. v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co.,</i> 547 F.3d 48, 51 (1st Cir. 2008). We may consider materials incorporated in the complaint (here, the notice Melfi received) and also facts subject to judicial notice. <i>In re Colonial Mortgage Bankers Corp.,</i> 324 F.3d 12, 14 (1st Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p>TILA provides that \"[t]he creditor shall clearly and conspicuously disclose, in accordance with regulations of the Board, to any obligor [here, Melfi] in a transaction subject to this section the rights of the obligor under this section.\" 15 U.S.C. § 1635(a). Regulation Z says what the notice of the right to cancel must clearly and conspicuously disclose; pertinently, the regulation requires that the notice include \"[t]he date the rescission period expires.\" 12 C.F.R. § 226.23(b)(1)(v).</p>\n<p>The Board has created a model form; a creditor must provide either the model form or a \"substantially similar notice.\" 12 C.F.R. § 226.23(b)(2). The use of the model form insulates the creditor from most insufficient disclosure claims. 15 U.S.C. § 1604(b). WMC gave Melfi the model form, but the spaces left for the date of the transaction and the date of the rescission deadline were not filled in. The form Melfi received had the date of the transaction stamped at its top (but it was not so designated) and then read in part:</p>\n<blockquote>You are entering into a transaction that will result in a mortgage/lien/security interest on your home. You have a legal right under federal law to cancel this transaction, without cost, within THREE BUSINESS DAYS from whichever of the following events occurs LAST:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(1) The date of the transaction, which is ____________ ; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) The date you receive your Truth in Lending disclosures; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(3) The date you received this notice of your right to cancel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>HOW TO CANCEL</blockquote>\n<blockquote>If you decide to cancel this transaction, you may do so by notifying us in writing. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote>You may use any written statement that is signed and dated by you and states your intention to cancel and/or you may use this notice by dating and signing below.

If you send or deliver your written notice to cancel some other way, it must be delivered to the above address no later than that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . . .</blockquote>\n<p>Melfi's argument is straightforward. Regulation Z requires in substance the deadline for rescission be provided; one of the three measuring datesthe date of the transactionwas left blank (the other two are described but have no blanks); and therefore the notice was deficient and Melfi <span class=\"star-pagination\">*312</span> has three years to rescind. A number of district court cases, along with two circuit court opinions, support Melfi's position,<sup>[1]</sup> although one of the circuit cases also involved more serious substantive flaws.</p>\n<p>The circuit cases are now elderly and may be in tension with later TILA amendments, but the statements that \"technical\" violations of TILA are fatal has been echoed in other cases. This circuit took a notably different approach in <i>Palmer</i> to determining whether arguable flaws compromised effective disclosure process. <i>See also </i><i>Santos-Rodriguez v. Doral Mortgage Corp.,</i> 485 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir.2007). Following <i>Palmer,</i> district court decisions in this circuit concluded that failing to fill in a blank did not automatically trigger a right to rescind.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>In <i>Palmer,</i> the plaintiff received a notice of her right to cancel that followed the Federal Reserve's model form but the form was not received until after the rescission deadline listed on the notice. 465 F.3d at 27. Nonetheless, <i>Palmer</i> held that the notice \"was crystal clear\" because it included (as in the Federal Reserve's model form) the alternative deadline (not given as a date but solely in descriptive form) of three business days following the date the notice was received, so the plaintiff still knew that she had three days to act. <i>Id.</i> at 29.</p>\n<p><i>Palmer</i> did not involve the blank date problem. <i>Palmer,</i> 465 F.3d at 29. But the principle on which <i>Palmer</i> rests is broader than the precise facts: technical deficiencies do not matter if the borrower receives a notice that effectively gives him notice as to the final date for rescission and has the three full days to act. Our test is whether any reasonable person, in reading the form provided in this case, would so understand it. Here, the omitted dates made no difference.</p>\n<p>The date that Melfi closed on the loan can hardly have been unknown to him and was in fact hand stamped or typed on the form given to him. From that date, it is easy enough to count three days; completing the blank avoids only the risk created by the fact that Saturday counts as a business day under Board regulations, 12 C.F.R. § 226.2(6), and the borrower might think otherwise. <i>Lafferty,</i> 698 F.2d at 769 n. 3 (\"[T]he precise purpose of requiring the creditor to fill in the date [of the rescission deadline] is to prevent the customer from having to calculate three business days\").</p>\n<p>Nor does completing the blank necessarily tell the borrower how long he has to rescind. Where after the closing the borrower is mailed either the notice or certain other required information, the three days runs not from the transaction date but from the last date when the borrower receives the notice and other required documents. Melfi himself says he was given the form on the date of the closing and does not claim that there was any pertinent delay in giving him the other required disclosures. So the blanks in no way misled Melfi in this case.</p>\n<p>So the argument for allowing Melfi to extend his deadline from three days to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*313</span> three years depends on this premise: that any flaw or deviation should be penalized automatically in order to deter such errors in the future. If Congress had made such a determination as a matter of policy, a court would respect that determination; possibly, this would also be so if the Board had made the same determination. <i>See </i><i>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc.,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). Melfi argues at length that we owe such deference to the Board.</p>\n<p>The answer is that there is no evidence in TILA or any Board regulation that either Congress or the Board intended to render the form a nullity because of an uncompleted blank in the form or similar flaw where, as here, it could not possibly have caused Melfi to think that he had months in order to rescind. The central purpose of the disclosurethe short notice period for rescission at willwas plain despite the blanks. Melfi's argument assumes, rather than establishes, that a penalty was intended.</p>\n<p>Some cases finding a blank notice form to be grounds for rescission even though harmless were decided under an earlier version of TILA. In 1995, Congress added a new subsection to TILA, titled \"Limitation on Rescission Liability.\" It provided that a borrower could not rescind \"solely from the form of written notice used by the creditor ... if the creditor provided the [borrower] the appropriate form of written notice published and adopted by the Board. ...\" Truth in Lending Act Amendments of 1995, Pub L. No. 104-29, § 5, 109 Stat. 271, 274 (1995) (codified at 15 U.S.C. § 1635(h)).</p>\n<p>Read literally, this safe harbor <i>may</i> not be available to WMC because, while it used the Board's form of notice, it did not properly fill in the blanks.

To this extent, Congress has now leaned against a penalty approach and, perhaps, weakened the present force of the older case law favoring extension of the rescission deadline.</p>\n<p>In any event, in the absence of some direction from Congress or the Board to impose a penalty, we see no policy basis for such a result.

At the closing, Melfi received from WMC a notice of his right to rescind the transaction. The notice is required for such a transaction by the Truth in Lending Act (\"TILA\"), 15 U.S.C. § 1635(a) (2006). Assuming that the notice complies with TILA, a borrower is given three \"business days\" to rescind the transaction; otherwise, the period is much longer. <i>Id.</i> The question in this case is whether the notice given Melfi adequately complied.</p>\n<p>The three-day period aims \"to give the consumer the opportunity to reconsider any transaction which would have the serious consequence of encumbering the title to his [or her] home.\" S.Rep. No. 96-368, at 28 (1979), <i>reprinted in</i> 1980 U.S.C.C.A.N. 236, 264. Under TILA, the requirements for the notice are established by the Federal Reserve Board (\"the Board\") in its Regulation Z. 12 C.F.R. § 226.23 (2007). Failure to provide proper notice extends to three years the borrower's deadline to rescind. <i>Id.</i> § 226.23(a)(3).</p>\n<p>About 20 months after the closing, Melfi attempted to rescind the transaction. The incentives for a borrower to do so may be substantial where a new loan is available, especially if rates have fallen or substantial interest has been paid during the period of the original loan. \"When a consumer rescinds a transaction ... the consumer shall not be liable for any amount, including any finance charge\" and \"the creditor shall return any money or property that has been given to anyone in connection with the transaction. ...\" 12 C.F.R. 226.23(d)(1), (2).</p>\n<p>Melfi argued that the notice of his right to cancel was deficient because it left blank the spaces for the date of the transaction (although the date was stamped on the top right corner of the notice) and the actual deadline to rescind. WMC and co-defendants Deutsche Bank and Wells Fargo (the loan's trustee and servicer, respectively) refused to allow the rescission, and Melfi then brought this action in the federal district court in Rhode Island.</p>\n<p>The district court, following our decision in <i>Palmer v. Champion Mortgage,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202442\"><a href=\"/opinion/202442/palmer-v-champion-mortgage/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2006), asked whether a borrower of average intelligence would be <span class=\"star-pagination\">*311</span> confused by the Notice. <i>Melfi v. WMC Mortgage Corp.,</i> No. 08-024ML, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">64338</span></span>, at *1 (D.R.I. Jan.9, 2009). The court ruled that even if the omissions in the notice were violations, they were at most technical violations that did not give rise to an extended rescission period because the notice was clear and conspicuous despite the omissions, and it dismissed Melfi's complaint. <i>Id.</i> at *3.</p>\n<p>Melfi now appeals. Our review is <i>de novo,</i> accepting all of the well-pleaded facts in the complaint as true and drawing reasonable inferences in favor of Melfi. <i>Andrew Robinson Int'l, Inc. v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203562\"><a href=\"/opinion/203562/andrew-robinson-intern-v-hartford-fire-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></a></span>, 51 (1st Cir. 2008). We may consider materials incorporated in the complaint (here, the notice Melfi received) and also facts subject to judicial notice. <i>In re Colonial Mortgage Bankers Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200395\"><a href=\"/opinion/200395/colonial-mortgage-v-banco/\"><span class=\"volume\">324</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 14 (1st Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p>TILA provides that \"[t]he creditor shall clearly and conspicuously disclose, in accordance with regulations of the Board, to any obligor [here, Melfi] in a transaction subject to this section the rights of the obligor under this section.\" 15 U.S.C. § 1635(a). Regulation Z says what the notice of the right to cancel must clearly and conspicuously disclose; pertinently, the regulation requires that the notice include \"[t]he date the rescission period expires.\" 12 C.F.R. § 226.23(b)(1)(v).</p>\n<p>The Board has created a model form; a creditor must provide either the model form or a \"substantially similar notice.\" 12 C.F.R. § 226.23(b)(2). The use of the model form insulates the creditor from most insufficient disclosure claims. 15 U.S.C. § 1604(b). WMC gave Melfi the model form, but the spaces left for the date of the transaction and the date of the rescission deadline were not filled in. The form Melfi received had the date of the transaction stamped at its top (but it was not so designated) and then read in part:</p>\n<blockquote>You are entering into a transaction that will result in a mortgage/lien/security interest on your home. You have a legal right under federal law to cancel this transaction, without cost, within THREE BUSINESS DAYS from whichever of the following events occurs LAST:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(1) The date of the transaction, which is ____________ ; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) The date you receive your Truth in Lending disclosures; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(3) The date you received this notice of your right to cancel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>HOW TO CANCEL</blockquote>\n<blockquote>If you decide to cancel this transaction, you may do so by notifying us in writing. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote>You may use any written statement that is signed and dated by you and states your intention to cancel and/or you may use this notice by dating and signing below. Keep one copy of this notice because it contains important information about your rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>If you cancel by mail or telegram, you must send the notice no later than MIDNIGHT of _____________ (or MIDNIGHT of the THIRD BUSINESS DAY following the latest of the three events listed above). If you send or deliver your written notice to cancel some other way, it must be delivered to the above address no later than that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . . .</blockquote>\n<p>Melfi's argument is straightforward.
